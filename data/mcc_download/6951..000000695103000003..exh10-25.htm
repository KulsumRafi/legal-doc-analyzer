such transaction may be granted Options in substitution for options
granted by their former employer.  If such substitute Options are
granted, the Committee, in its sole discretion and consistent with

the maximum term of the Option (subject to Section 5.8.4 regarding
Incentive Stock Options).
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>5.5     Exercisability of Options.  Options granted under the Plan
shall be exercisable at such times and be subject to such restrictions
and conditions as the Committee shall determine in its sole discretion.
After an Option is granted, the Committee, in its sole discretion, may
accelerate the exercisability of the Option.  However, in no event may
any Option granted to a Section 16 Person be exercisable until at least
six (6) months following the Grant Date (or such shorter period as may

<p>5.6     Payment.  Options shall be exercised by the Participant's
delivery of a written notice of exercise to the Secretary of the
Company (or its designee), setting forth the number of Shares with
respect to which the Option is to be exercised, accompanied by full
payment for the Shares.
<p>Upon the exercise of any Option, the Exercise Price shall
be payable to the Company in full in cash or its equivalent.  The
Committee, in its sole discretion, also may permit exercise (a) by
tendering previously acquired Shares having an aggregate Fair Market
Value at the time of exercise equal to the total Exercise Price, or (b)
by any other means which the Committee, in its sole discretion,
determines to both provide legal consideration for the Shares, and to
be consistent with the purposes of the Plan.
<p>As soon as practicable after receipt of a written
notification of exercise and full payment for the Shares purchased, the
Company shall deliver to the Participant (or the Participant's
designated broker), Share certificates (which may be in book entry
form) representing such Shares.

<p>5.7     Restrictions on Share Transferability.  The Committee may
impose such restrictions on any Shares acquired pursuant to the
exercise of an Option as it may deem advisable, including, but not
limited to, restrictions related to applicable federal securities laws,
the requirements of any national securities exchange or system upon
which Shares are then listed or traded, or any blue sky or state
securities laws.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>5.8.1   Exercisability.  The aggregate Fair Market Value
(determined on the Grant Date(s)) of the Shares with respect to which

<p>5.8.2   Termination of Service.  No Incentive Stock Option
may be exercised more than three (3) months after the Participant's
Termination of Service for any reason other than Disability or death,
unless (a) the Participant dies during such three-month period, and (b)
the Award Agreement or the Committee permits later exercise.  No
Incentive Stock Option may be exercised more than one (1) year after
the Participant's Termination of Service on account of Disability,
unless (a) the Participant dies during such one-year period, and (b)
the Award Agreement or the Committee permit later exercise.

Options may be granted only to persons who are employees of the Company
or a Subsidiary on the Grant Date.

provided, however, that if the Option is granted to an Employee who,
together with persons whose stock ownership is attributed to the
Employee pursuant to Section 424(d) of the Code, owns stock possessing
more than 10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of the
stock of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, the Option may not be
exercised after the expiration of five (5) years from the Grant Date.

STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS</p>

<p>6.1     Grant of SARs.  Subject to the terms and conditions of the

However, the exercise price of a Freestanding SAR shall be not less

the Grant Date.  The exercise price of Tandem or Affiliated SARs shall
equal the Exercise Price of the related Option.  In no event shall an
SAR granted to a Section 16 Person become exercisable until at least
six (6) months after the Grant Date (or such shorter period as may be
permissible while maintaining compliance with Rule 16b-3).
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>6.2     Exercise of Tandem SARs.  Tandem SARs may be exercised for
all or part of the Shares subject to the related Option upon the
surrender of the right to exercise the equivalent portion of the
related Option.  A Tandem SAR may be exercised only with respect to the
Shares for which its related Option is then exercisable.  With respect
to a Tandem SAR granted in connection with an Incentive Stock Option:
(a) the Tandem SAR shall expire no later than the expiration of the
underlying Incentive Stock Option; (b) the value of the payout with
respect to the Tandem SAR shall be for no more than one hundred percent
(100%) of the difference between the Exercise Price of the underlying
Incentive Stock Option and the Fair Market Value of the Shares subject
to the underlying Incentive Stock Option at the time the Tandem SAR is
exercised; and (c) the Tandem SAR shall be exercisable only when the
Fair Market Value of the Shares subject to the Incentive Stock Option
exceeds the Exercise Price of the Incentive Stock Option.

<p>6.3     Exercise of Affiliated SARs.  An Affiliated SAR shall be
deemed to be exercised upon the exercise of the related Option.  The
deemed exercise of an Affiliated SAR shall not necessitate a reduction
in the number of Shares subject to the related Option.

<p>6.4     Exercise of Freestanding SARs.  Freestanding SARs shall be
exercisable on such terms and conditions as the Committee, in its sole
discretion, shall determine.  However, no SAR granted to a Section 16
Person shall be exercisable until at least six (6) months after the
Grant Date (or such shorter period as may be permissible while
maintaining compliance with Rule 16b-3).

<p>6.5     SAR Agreement.  Each SAR grant shall be evidenced by an
Award Agreement that shall specify the exercise price, the term of the
SAR, the conditions of exercise, and such other terms and conditions as
the Committee, in its sole discretion, shall determine.

<p>6.6     Expiration of SARs.  An SAR granted under the Plan shall
expire upon the date determined by the Committee, in its sole
discretion, and set forth in the Award Agreement.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the rules of Section 5.4 also shall apply to SARs.

<p>6.7     Payment of SAR Amount.  Upon exercise of an SAR, a
Participant shall be entitled to receive payment from the Company in an
amount determined by multiplying:

Share on the date of exercise over the exercise price; times
<p>(b)     The number of Shares with respect to which the SAR is
exercised.

RESTRICTED STOCK</P>

<p>7.1     Grant of Restricted Stock.  Subject to the terms and
provisions of the Plan, the Committee, at any time and from time to
time, may grant Shares of Restricted Stock to Employees and Consultants
in such amounts as the Committee, in its sole discretion, shall
determine.  The Committee, in its sole discretion, shall determine the
number of Shares to be granted to each Participant, provided that
during any Fiscal Year, no Participant shall receive more than 350,000
Shares of Restricted Stock.

<p>7.2     Restricted Stock Agreement.  Each Award of Restricted Stock
shall be evidenced by an Award Agreement that shall specify the Period
of Restriction, the number of Shares granted, and such other terms and
conditions as the Committee, in its sole discretion, shall determine.
Unless the Committee determines otherwise, Shares of Restricted Stock
shall be held by the Company as escrow agent until the restrictions on
such Shares have lapsed.

<p>7.3     Transferability.  Except as provided in this Section 7,
Shares of Restricted Stock may not be sold, transferred, pledged,
assigned, or otherwise alienated or hypothecated until the end of the
applicable Period of Restriction.  However, in no event may the
restrictions on Restricted Stock granted to a Section 16 Person lapse
prior to six (6) months following the Grant Date (or such shorter
period as may be permissible while maintaining compliance with Rule
16b-3).

<p>7.4     Other Restrictions.  The Committee, in its sole discretion,
may impose such other restrictions on Shares of Restricted Stock as it
may deem advisable or appropriate, in accordance with this Section 7.4.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>7.4.1   General Restrictions.  The Committee may set
restrictions based upon the achievement of specific performance
objectives (Company-wide, divisional, or individual), applicable
federal or state securities laws, or any other basis determined by the
Committee in its discretion.

<p>7.4.2   Section 162(m) Performance Restrictions.  For
purposes of qualifying grants of Restricted Stock as "performance-
based compensation" under Section 162(m) of the Code, the Committee,
in its discretion, may set restrictions based upon the achievement of
Performance Goals.  The Performance Goals shall be set by the Committee
on or before the latest date permissible to enable the Restricted Stock
to qualify as "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) of
the Code.  In granting Restricted Stock which is intended to qualify
under Section 162(m) of the Code, the Committee shall follow any
procedures determined by it from time to time to be necessary or
appropriate to ensure qualification of the Restricted Stock under
Section 162(m) of the Code (e.g., in determining the Performance
Goals).

<p>7.4.3   Legend on Certificates.  The Committee, in its
discretion, may legend the certificates representing Restricted Stock
to give appropriate notice of such restrictions.  For example, the
Committee may determine that some or all certificates representing
Shares of Restricted Stock shall bear the following legend:
<p>"The sale or other transfer of the shares of stock
represented by this certificate, whether voluntary,
involuntary, or by operation of law, is subject to certain
restrictions on transfer as set forth in the Applied
Materials, Inc. 1995 Equity Incentive Plan, and in a
Restricted Stock Agreement.  A copy of the Plan and such
Restricted Stock Agreement may be obtained from the
Secretary of Applied Materials, Inc."
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>7.5     Removal of Restrictions.  Except as otherwise provided in
this Section 7, Shares of Restricted Stock covered by each Restricted
Stock grant made under the Plan shall be released from escrow as soon
as practicable after the last day of the Period of Restriction.
Subject to the minimum Period of Restriction specified in Section 2.35,
the Committee, in its discretion, may accelerate the time at which any
restrictions shall lapse or be removed.  After the restrictions have
lapsed, the Participant shall be entitled to have any legend or legends
under Section 7.4.3 removed from his or her Share certificate, and the
Shares shall be freely transferable by the Participant.

<p>7.6     Voting Rights.  During the Period of Restriction,
Participants holding Shares of Restricted Stock granted hereunder may
exercise full voting rights with respect to those Shares, unless the
Committee determines otherwise.

<p>7.7     Dividends and Other Distributions.  During the Period of
Restriction, Participants holding Shares of Restricted Stock shall be
entitled to receive all dividends and other distributions paid with
respect to such Shares unless otherwise provided in the Award
Agreement.  If any such dividends or distributions are paid in Shares,
the Shares shall be subject to the same restrictions on transferability
and forfeitability as the Shares of Restricted Stock with respect to
which they were paid.
<p>With respect to Restricted Stock granted to a Section 16
Person, any dividend or distribution that constitutes a "derivative
security" or an "equity security" under Section 16 of the 1934 Act
shall be subject to a Period of Restriction equal to the longer of:
(a) the remaining Period of Restriction on the Shares of Restricted
Stock with respect to which the dividend or distribution is paid; or
(b) six (6) months.

<p>7.8     Return of Restricted Stock to Company.  On the date set
forth in the Award Agreement, the Restricted Stock for which
restrictions have not lapsed shall revert to the Company and again
shall become available for grant under the Plan.

PERFORMANCE UNITS AND PERFORMANCE SHARES</p>

<p>8.1     Grant of Performance Units/Shares.  Performance Units and
Performance Shares may be granted to Employees and Consultants at any
time and from time to time, as shall be determined by the Committee, in
its sole discretion.  The Committee shall have complete discretion in
determining the number of Performance Units and Performance Shares
granted to each Participant provided that during any Fiscal Year, (a)
no Participant shall receive Performance Units having an initial value
greater than $3,000,000, and (b) no Participant shall receive more than
350,000 Performance Shares.

<p>8.2     Value of Performance Units/Shares.  Each Performance Unit
shall have an initial value that is established by the Committee on or
before the Grant Date.  Each Performance Share shall have an initial
value equal to the Fair Market Value of a Share on the Grant Date.

<p>8.3     Performance Objectives and Other Terms.  The Committee
shall set performance objectives in its discretion which, depending on
the extent to which they are met, will determine the number or value of
Performance Units/Shares that will be paid out to the Participants.
The time period during which the performance objectives must be met
shall be called the "Performance Period."  Performance Periods of
Awards granted to Section 16 Persons shall, in all cases, exceed six
(6) months in length (or such shorter period as may be permissible
while maintaining compliance with Rule 16b-3).  Each Award of
Performance Units/Shares shall be evidenced by an Award Agreement that
shall specify the Performance Period, and such other terms and
conditions as the Committee, in its sole discretion, shall determine.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>8.3.1   General Performance Objectives.  The Committee may
set performance objectives based upon the achievement of Company-wide,
divisional, or individual goals, applicable federal or state securities
laws, or any other basis determined by the Committee in its discretion.

<p>8.3.2   Section 162(m) Performance Objectives.  For purposes
of qualifying grants of Performance Units/Shares as "performance-based
compensation" under Section 162(m) of the Code, the Committee, in its
discretion, may determine that the performance objectives applicable to
Performance Units/Shares shall be based on the achievement of
Performance Goals.  The Performance Goals shall be set by the Committee
on or before the latest date permissible to enable the Performance
Units/Shares to qualify as "performance-based compensation" under
Section 162(m) of the Code.  In granting Performance Units/Shares which
are intended to qualify under Section 162(m) of the Code, the Committee
shall follow any procedures determined by it from time to time to be
necessary or appropriate to ensure qualification of the Performance
Units/Shares under Section 162(m) of the Code (e.g., in determining the
Performance Goals).
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>8.4     Earning of Performance Units/Shares.  After the applicable
Performance Period has ended, the holder of Performance Units/Shares
shall be entitled to receive a payout of the number of Performance
Units/Shares earned by the Participant over the Performance Period, to
be determined as a function of the extent to which the corresponding
performance objectives have been achieved.  After the grant of a
Performance Unit/Share, the Committee, in its sole discretion, may
reduce or waive any performance objectives for such Performance
Unit/Share; provided, however, that Performance Periods of Awards
granted to Section 16 Persons shall not be less than six (6) months (or
such shorter period as may be permissible while maintaining compliance
with Rule 16b-3).

<p>8.5     Form and Timing of Payment of Performance Units/Shares.
Payment of earned Performance Units/Shares shall be made as soon as
practicable after the expiration of the applicable Performance Period.
The Committee, in its sole discretion, may pay earned Performance
Units/Shares in the form of cash, in Shares (which have an aggregate
Fair Market Value equal to the value of the earned Performance
Units/Shares at the close of the applicable Performance Period) or in a
combination thereof.

<p>8.6     Cancellation of Performance Units/Shares.  On the date set
forth in the Award Agreement, all unearned or unvested Performance
Units/Shares shall be forfeited to the Company, and again shall be
available for grant under the Plan.

MISCELLANEOUS</p>

<p>10.1    Deferrals.  The Committee, in its sole discretion, may
permit a Participant to defer receipt of the payment of cash or the
delivery of Shares that would otherwise be due to such Participant
under an Award.  Any such deferral elections shall be subject to such
rules and procedures as shall be determined by the Committee in its
sole discretion.

<p>10.2    No Effect on Employment or Service.  Nothing in the Plan
shall interfere with or limit in any way the right of the Company to
terminate any Participant's employment or service at any time, with or
without cause.  For purposes of the Plan, transfer of employment of a
Participant between the Company and any one of its Affiliates (or
between Affiliates) shall not be deemed a Termination of Service.
Employment with the Company and its Affiliates is on an at-will basis
only.

<p>10.3    Participation.  No Employee or Consultant shall have the
right to be selected to receive an Award under this Plan, or, having
been so selected, to be selected to receive a future Award.

<p>10.4    Indemnification.  Each person who is or shall have been a
member of the Committee, or of the Board, shall be indemnified and held
harmless by the Company against and from (a) any loss, cost, liability,
or expense that may be imposed upon or reasonably incurred by him or
her in connection with or resulting from any claim, action, suit, or
proceeding to which he or she may be a party or in which he or she may
be involved by reason of any action taken or failure to act under the
Plan or any Award Agreement, and (b) from any and all amounts paid by
him or her in settlement thereof, with the Company's approval, or paid
by him or her in satisfaction of any judgment in any such claim,
action, suit, or proceeding against him or her, provided he or she
shall give the Company an opportunity, at its own expense, to handle
and defend the same before he or she undertakes to handle and defend it
on his or her own behalf.  The foregoing right of indemnification shall
not be exclusive of any other rights of indemnification to which such
persons may be entitled under the Company's Certificate of
Incorporation or Bylaws, by contract, as a matter of law, or otherwise,
or under any power that the Company may have to indemnify them or hold
them harmless.

<p>10.5    Successors.  All obligations of the Company under the Plan,
with respect to Awards granted hereunder, shall be binding on any
successor to the Company, whether the existence of such successor is
the result of a direct or indirect purchase, merger, consolidation, or
otherwise, of all or substantially all of the business or assets of the
Company.

<p>10.6    Beneficiary Designations.  If permitted by the Committee, a
Participant under the Plan may name a beneficiary or beneficiaries to
whom any vested but unpaid Award shall be paid in the event of the
Participant's death.  Each such designation shall revoke all prior
designations by the Participant and shall be effective only if given in
a form and manner acceptable to the Committee.  In the absence of any
such designation, any vested benefits remaining unpaid at the
Participant's death shall be paid to the Participant's estate and,
subject to the terms of the Plan and of the applicable Award Agreement,
any unexercised vested Award may be exercised by the administrator or
executor of the Participant's estate.

<p>10.7    Limited Transferability of Awards.  No Award granted under
the Plan may be sold, transferred, pledged, assigned, or otherwise
alienated or hypothecated, other than by will, by the laws of descent
and distribution, or to the limited extent provided in Section 10.6.
All rights with respect to an Award granted to a Participant shall be
available during his or her lifetime only to the Participant.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Participant may, in a manner
specified by the Committee, (a) transfer a Nonqualified Stock Option to
a Participant's spouse, former spouse or dependent pursuant to a court-
approved domestic relations order which relates to the provision of
child support, alimony payments or marital property rights, and
(b) transfer a Nonqualified Stock Option by bona fide gift and not for
any consideration, to (i) a member or members of the Participant's
immediate family, (ii) a trust established for the exclusive benefit of
the Participant and/or member(s) of the Participant's immediate family,
(iii) a partnership, limited liability company of other entity whose
only partners or members are the Participant and/or member(s) of the
Participant's immediate family, or (iv) a foundation in which the
Participant an/or member(s) of the Participant's immediate family
control the management of the foundation's assets.

<p>10.8    No Rights as Stockholder.  Except to the limited extent
provided in Sections 7.6 and 7.7, no Participant (nor any beneficiary)
shall have any of the rights or privileges of a stockholder of the
Company with respect to any Shares issuable pursuant to an Award (or
exercise thereof), unless and until certificates representing such
Shares shall have been issued, recorded on the records of the Company
or its transfer agents or registrars, and delivered to the Participant
(or beneficiary).

AMENDMENT, TERMINATION, AND DURATION</p>

<p>11.1    Amendment, Suspension, or Termination.  The Board, in its
sole discretion, may amend, suspend or terminate the Plan, or any part
thereof, at any time and for any reason.  The amendment, suspension, or

Participant, alter or impair any rights or obligations under any Award
theretofore granted to such Participant.  No Award may be granted

TAX WITHHOLDING</p>

<p>12.1    Withholding Requirements.  Prior to the delivery of any
Shares or cash pursuant to an Award (or exercise thereof), the Company
shall have the power and the right to deduct or withhold, or require a
Participant to remit to the Company, an amount sufficient to satisfy
federal, state, and local taxes (including the Participant's FICA
obligation) required to be withheld with respect to such Award (or
exercise thereof).

<p>12.2    Withholding Arrangements.  The Committee, in its sole
discretion and pursuant to such procedures as it may specify from time
to time, may permit a Participant to satisfy such tax withholding
obligation, in whole or in part by (a) electing to have the Company
withhold otherwise deliverable Shares, or (b) delivering to the Company
already-owned Shares having a Fair Market Value equal to the amount
required to be withheld.  The amount of the withholding requirement
shall be deemed to include any amount which the Committee agrees may be
withheld at the time the election is made, not to exceed the amount
determined by using the maximum federal, state or local marginal income
tax rates applicable to the Participant with respect to the Award on
the date that the amount of tax to be withheld is to be determined.
The Fair Market Value of the Shares to be withheld or delivered shall
be determined as of the date that the taxes are required to be
withheld.
