The Corporation may terminate the Executive&#146;s employment at any time for Cause. For all purposes under this Agreement, &#147;Cause&#148; shall mean (1) a willful failure by the Executive to substantially perform the Executive&#146;s duties
under this Agreement, other than a failure resulting from the Executive&#146;s complete or partial incapacity due to physical or mental illness or impairment, (2) a willful act by the Executive that constitutes gross misconduct and that is

Executive; all as determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors in good faith; provided, however, that failure of the parties to reasonably agree to such performance measures shall not be grounds for termination for cause. No
