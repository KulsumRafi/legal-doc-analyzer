               3. Section 2(b) is deleted and shall be replaced in its entirety
as follows:

                  "(b) Termination by Employee or Company. The Company may
               terminate the duties of the Employee, except as a member of the
               Board of Directors, at any time by giving at least ninety (90)
               days prior written notice of such termination to the Employee. If
               the Company terminates employment of the Employee, the Employee
               shall continue to receive compensation pursuant to this Amendment
               No. 2 and shall continue to be an employee of the Company with
               all rights and benefits as provided under the Employment
               Agreement until December 31, 2003. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
               if the Company is prohibited by law or the terms of its plans to
               continue benefits to the Employee after his termination of
               employment, the Company shall, in the case of retirement
               benefits, provide such benefits through the Supplemental
               Executive Retirement Plan and the Benefit Equalization Plan or
               any other non-qualified retirement plan and in the case of
               welfare benefits, provide such benefits through individual
               insurance arrangements or self-insured arrangements. If either
               the Company or Employee decides not to extend the term of this
               Amendment No. 2 or further amend the Employment Agreement, then
               the Employee shall retire from the Company effective January 1,
               2004. The Employee may terminate his employment with the Company
               at any time by giving at least ninety (90) days prior written
               notice of such termination to the Company. If the Employee
               terminates his employment with the Company, the Employee shall
               not continue to receive compensation pursuant to this Amendment
               No. 2 and shall retire from the Company effective upon the date
               of such termination."

               4. Section 3(a) is deleted and shall be replaced in its entirety
as follows:

                  "Section 3. Compensation.

                  (a) Base Salary. In consideration for all services rendered by
               the Employee, hereunder or otherwise, to or for the benefit of
               the Company, its subsidiaries and affiliates, the Company shall
               pay the Employee a base salary at the rate per annum equal to Two
               Hundred Thousand Dollars ($200,000), payable in equal monthly
               installments."

               5. Section 3(c) is deleted and shall be replaced in its entirety
as follows:

                  "(c) Incentive Compensation. The Employee shall continue to
               participate in all incentive compensation plans of the Company
               that the Employee participated in for Fiscal Year 2001 at the
               same percentages of base salary except that the base salary used
               to determine such incentive compensation shall be as provided in
               Section 3(a) of this Amendment No. 2."

               6. Section 3(d) is deleted and shall be replaced in its entirety

                  "(d) Benefit Plans. The Employee shall be eligible during the
               term of his employment under this Employment Agreement to
               participate in all Employee benefit plans and Employee fringe
               benefits such as medical, dental and disability and retirement
               programs (including the Company's Retirement Income Plan,
               Executive Deferred Compensation Plan, Supplemental Executive
               Retirement Plan, and Benefit Equalization Plan, but specifically
               excluding the Company's Senior Executive Severance Plan ("SESP"))
               now or hereafter made available to executive employees of the
               Company generally (collectively, such plans and programs, but
               excluding the SESP, are herein collectively referred to as the
               "Benefit Plans"), to the extent and on the same terms and
               conditions (subject, however, to the terms and provisions of any
               such plans or programs) as from time to time are accorded other
               employees serving as executive officers of the Company, except as
               such Benefit Plans may be expressly modified by the terms of the
               Employment Agreement, Amendment No. 1 and this Amendment No. 2.
               For purposes of life insurance, the Employee shall be reimbursed
               for the purchase of term life insurance in the same amount and
               same manner as in Fiscal Year 2001. Additionally, following
               expiration or termination of employment by the Company pursuant
               to this Amendment No. 2, the Company shall continue to provide
               medical coverage for Employee as long as Employee is Chairman of
               the Company's Board of Directors. Such medical coverage shall be
               comparable to medical coverage provided for executive employees
               of the Company and shall be paid for by the Company. However,
               Employee's participation in such medical coverage shall be
               subject to the terms of the applicable medical plan documents and
               applicable policies of the Company. If for any reason the Company
               cannot provide an entitled benefit as provided herein, the
               Company shall reimburse the Employee, on an after tax basis, the
               Employee's reasonable cost to secure such a benefit."

               7. The sentence added at the end of Section 6(a) by Amendment
No. 1 is deleted and shall be replaced in its entirety as follows:

                           "In the event of a `Triggering Termination' of the
               Employee during a `Change of Control Period' pursuant to this
               Section, severance payable to the Employee pursuant to his
               Executive Severance Agreement shall be determined by disregarding
               Employee's base salary and incentive compensation for Fiscal Year
               2003 and using in lieu thereof Employee's base salary and
               incentive compensation for Fiscal Year 2001."

The effective date of this Amendment No. 2 to the Employment Agreement shall be
January 1, 2003.

All other terms and conditions of the Employment Agreement and Amendment No. 1
to the Employment Agreement shall remain unchanged and in effect.
