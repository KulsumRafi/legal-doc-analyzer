                    ----------------------------------------


     This Amendment dated January 29, 2003 (this "Amendment") is made to the
Employment and Non-Competition Agreement dated as of November 5, 1997 (the

and all related and affiliated entities, successors and assigns now in existence
or hereinafter created ("ENI"), and Wayne J. Conner ("Conner").

     WHEREAS, Section 4(b) of the Agreement provides that ENI shall pay Conner a
management incentive bonus each fiscal year during the Term (as defined in the
Agreement); and

     WHEREAS, as an inducement to Conner to continue his employment with ENI
pursuant to the Agreement, the parties wish to execute this Amendment to
establish the specific terms of the incentive bonus for the fiscal years 2003
and later, which terms shall be identical to the terms governing the incentive
bonus for the fiscal years of ENI 1997 through 2002.

     NOW, THEREFORE, it is hereby agreed as follows:

     9.   Preamble; Recitals. The preamble and recitals set forth above are
          incorporated in and form a part of this Amendment.

     10.  Amendment. Section 4(b) of the Agreement is hereby amended by adding
          the following as the last sentence thereto: "For each fiscal year of
          ENI beginning with the 2003 fiscal year and continuing for each fiscal
          year until the expiration of the Term or earlier termination of this
          Agreement, Conner shall be entitled to receive an Incentive Bonus
          equal to 1.50% of ENI's EBITDA for such fiscal year, to be paid as
          provided above in this Section 4(b)."

     11.  Full Force and Effect. The Agreement, as amended hereby, continues in
          full force and effect.

     12.  Counsel. Conner acknowledges that he has been advised to obtain
          separate legal counsel to review this Amendment and advise him
          regarding the legal consequences of the same. Mayer, Brown, Rowe & Maw
          has drafted this Amendment as counsel for ENI with Conner's consent.
          Although Mayer, Brown, Rowe & Maw has represented Conner previously in
          other matters not involving the Agreement, Mayer, Brown, Rowe & Maw is
          not acting as attorney for Conner with respect to this Amendment.
          Mayer, Brown, Rowe & Maw shall be under no obligation to maintain the
          confidentiality from ENI of any matter communicated to it by Conner
          with respect to this Amendment.
