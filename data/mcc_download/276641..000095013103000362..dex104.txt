     or its designee shall review this base salary annually and shall have the
     right to increase it at any time during the employment period. An
     increase in base salary shall be evidenced by the Board of Directors or
     its designee approving an amended Schedule A to this Employment
     Agreement, which shall give the amount of the increase in base salary,
     the new total base salary and the period for which the increase shall be
     effective.

     designee and Zaepfel and agreed to by the Board of Directors with the

     provide a fair and professionally challenging achievement rewarding good

     by the Board of Directors.

6. BENEFITS

     Zaepfel shall be eligible for all medical and dental benefits, disability
     benefits, long term incentive plans, stock options, profit sharing,
     savings plans, automobile allowance, paid vacation, paid-up split dollar
     and whole life insurance policies then in effect, a membership at a
     country club and other benefits which are or shall be adopted by Spiegel
     covering its senior executive management staff, provided he meets the
     qualification requirements for such benefits. Additional benefits may be
     added during the term of this Agreement by Spiegel.

7. DISABILITY OF ZAEPFEL
------------------------
     If, during the term of this Employment Agreement, Zaepfel shall become
     disabled by accident, illness, or otherwise, and such disability shall
     continue for a period of six (6) successive months following which he is
     unable to resume his duties hereunder, Spiegel shall have the right to
     terminate the employment period by giving written notice to Zaepfel of
     its intention to do so at least thirty (30) days prior to the effective
     date of such termination, provided, however, Spiegel agrees to pay a lump
     sum at the time of termination in an amount equal to the fair value of
     his entire compensation and benefits package in place at that time
     calculated for a period of six (6) months commencing from the effective
     date of such termination in lieu of continuing to provide such benefits
     in periodic amounts. Any dispute as to whether such a disability has
     occurred shall be resolved by a physician reasonably satisfactory to both
     parties, whose determination shall be final and binding on both parties,

8. TERMINATION FOR CAUSE
------------------------
     Spiegel may terminate the employment period for cause for the following
     reasons other than innocent acts: repetitive and offensive public
     intoxication, a felony conviction, the

                                      3

<PAGE>

     intentional perpetration of a dishonest act of fraud against Spiegel or
     an affiliate or subsidiary thereof, which is significantly injurious in a
     material respect to the financial condition, business, or reputation of
     Spiegel or any of its affiliates or subsidiaries. Spiegel shall have the
     right to terminate the employment period for any above reason by giving
     written notice to Zaepfel of its intention to do so and specifying
     therein the reason and the effective date of termination. In this case a
     severance payment will be reasonably appropriate to the reason for
     termination, and this Agreement will have no further effect.

9. OTHER EMPLOYMENT
-------------------
     Zaepfel covenants and agrees that during the employment period, he will
     not directly or indirectly (except with the written consent of Spiegel)
     become engaged in, be employed by, render services to or for, or permit
     his name to be used in connection with any business other than the
     business of Spiegel and its subsidiaries and affiliates, whether such
     other business is or is not competitive with that business. After
     termination of this Agreement, Zaepfel agrees that for a period of one
     year he will not solicit for engagement or as an employee any person who
     has been employed by the Company within the preceding twelve months as a
     senior level executive.

10. TRADE SECRETS
-----------------
     Zaepfel shall not at any time while this Employment Agreement is in
     force, and for a period of two (2) years after its termination, unless
     authorized by Spiegel, divulge or disclose to any person or corporation
     any confidential or proprietary information relating to the business of
     Spiegel or its subsidiaries and affiliates including, but not in
     limitation, customer list, supplier lists, prices of products, services
     or operational processes. A breach of this confidentiality clause will
     result in no compensation and benefits being paid at the time of
     termination.
