1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Establishment of the Plan</U>.  Arch Wireless Holdings, Inc. (the &#147;Company
&#148;) hereby establishes an unfunded severance benefits plan (the &#147;Plan&#148;) that is
intended to be a welfare benefit plan within the meaning of Section 3(1) of the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (&#147;ERISA&#148;).
The Plan is intended to benefit certain employees whose employment is
terminated by the Company after the date on which the Company&#146;s files a
voluntary petition in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of
Massachusetts pursuant to Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code (the &#147;Effective
Date&#148;). This Plan is a consolidation, amendment, and restatement of, and
supersedes any and all severance plans, separation policies or practices
applying to employees which may have been in effect throughout the Company and
any controlled group of corporations of which it is a member as defined in
Section 414(b) and (c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
&#147;Code&#148;) at any time prior to the Effective Date of this Plan, except
for explicit provisions of any bankruptcy court approved retention plan or
written employment agreements between the Company and individual employees.
This Plan will be effective only if it is approved by the United States
Bankruptcy Court for the District of Massachusetts. </FONT> </P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Purpose</U>.
The purpose of the Plan is to enable the Company to attract and retain the
employees needed by the Company to provide employees eligible for benefits
under the Plan with the security that they will receive appropriate severance
if terminated under the circumstances described in this Plan. The severance
benefits provided under the Plan are intended to assist such employees in
making a transition to new employment and are not intended to be a reward for
prior service with the Company. </FONT> </P>

<U>Coverage</U>. The Eligible Employees shall be all employees of the Company (a) who
are on a payroll maintained in the United States on or after the Effective Date, and
(b) who are regularly scheduled to work at least 30 hours or more per week, other than
individuals designated by the Company as temporary employees. Nothing in this Plan
shall be construed to provide any employee with a guarantee of employment and does
not supersede the Company&#146;s policy of at will employment.  </FONT></P>

          Chapter 7 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. Any such amendment, modification
          or termination shall be effected by a written instrument executed by an

          modification or termination reduce or diminish any severance benefits owing

          or additional benefits to those provided under this Plan, then the employee

          <U>Integration with Other Pay or Benefits Requirements</U>. The Severance
          Benefits provided for in the Plan are the maximum benefits that the Company will
          pay to an Eligible Employee. To the extent that the Company owes any amounts in
          the nature of severance benefits under any other program, policy or plan of the
          Company, or to the extent that any federal, state or local law, including,
          without limitation, so-called &#147;plant closing&#148; laws, requires the
          Company to give advance notice or make a payment of any kind to an employee
          because of that employee&#146;s involuntary termination due to a layoff,
          reduction in force, plant or facility closing, sale of business, or similar
          event, the benefits provided under this Plan or the other arrangement shall
          either be reduced or eliminated to avoid any duplication of payment. The Company
          intends for the benefits provided under this Plan to satisfy any and all
          statutory obligations which may arise out of an employee&#146;s involuntary
          termination for the foregoing reasons and the Plan Administrator shall so
          construe and implement the terms of the Plan. The Plan Administrator will
          determine how to apply this provision, and may override other provisions of this
          Plan in doing so. </FONT></P>

          <U>Claims Procedure</U>. Any Eligible Employee who believes he or she is
          entitled to severance benefits under the Plan which are not being paid may
          submit a written claim for payment to the Plan Administrator. Any Eligible
          Employee otherwise entitled to benefits under this Plan must make such claim
          within sixty (60) days of termination of employment in order to be eligible for
          benefits. Any claim for benefits shall be in writing, addressed to the Plan
          Administrator and must be sufficient to notify the Plan Administrator of the
          benefit claimed. If the claim of an Eligible Employee is denied, the Plan
          Administrator shall within a reasonable period of time provide a written notice
          of denial to the Eligible Employee. The notice will include the specific reasons
          for denial, the provisions of the Plan on which the denial is based, and the
          procedure for a review of the denied claim. Where appropriate, it will also
          include a description of any additional material or information necessary to
          complete or perfect the claim and an explanation of why that material or
          information is necessary. The Eligible Employee may request in writing a review
          of a claim denied by the Plan Administrator and may review pertinent documents
          and submit issues and comments in writing to the Administrator. The Plan
          Administrator shall provide to the Eligible Employee a written decision upon
          such request for review of a denied claim. The decision of the Plan
          Administrator upon such review shall be final. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
addition to creating rights for Plan participants, ERISA imposes duties upon the people
who are responsible for the operation of the employee benefit plan. The people who operate
the Company&#146;s Plan, called &#147;fiduciaries&#148;, have a duty to do so prudently
and in the interest of Plan participants and beneficiaries. Neither the Company nor any
other person may fire a participant or otherwise discriminate against a participant in any
way to prevent a participant from obtaining a benefit under the Plan or exercising the
participant&#146;s rights under ERISA. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Indent Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Workstation" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
a participant&#146;s claim for a benefit is denied in whole or in part, the participant
must receive a written explanation of the reason for the denial. The participant has the
right to have the Plan Administrator review and reconsider the participant&#146;s claim.
Under ERISA, there are steps a participant can take to enforce the above rights. For
instance, if the participant requests materials from the Plan Administrator and does not
receive them within thirty (30) days, the participant may file suit in a federal court. In
such a case, the court may require the Plan Administrator to provide the materials and pay
the participant up to $110 per day until the participant receives the materials, unless
the materials were not sent because of reasons beyond the control of the Plan
Administrator. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Indent Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Workstation" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
a participant&#146;s claim for benefits is denied or ignored, in whole or in part, the
participant may file suit in a state or federal court. If the Plan fiduciaries misuse the
Plan&#146;s funds, or if a participant is discriminated against for asserting his or her
rights, the participant may seek assistance from the U.S. Department of Labor, or may file
suit in a federal court. The court will decide who should pay court costs and legal fees. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Indent Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Workstation" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
a participant is successful, the court may order the person sued to pay costs and fees. If
the participant loses, the court may order the employee to pay these fees (for example, if
the claim is frivolous). Participant should contact the Plan Administrator concerning
questions about the program. Participants who have any questions about this statement or
rights under ERISA should contact the nearest area office of the Pension and Welfare
Benefits Administration, U.S. Department of Labor listed in the telephone directory or the
Division of Technical Assistance and Inquiries, Pension and Welfare Benefits
Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C.

          shall be construed in accordance with and under applicable provisions of ERISA,
          and the regulations thereunder, and the laws of the Commonwealth of
          Massachusetts (without regard to conflict of laws provisions) to the extent not
          preempted by federal law. </FONT></P>

          <U>Drafting Errors</U>. If, due to errors in drafting, any Plan provision does
          not accurately reflect its intended meaning, as demonstrated by consistent
          interpretations or other evidence of intent, or as determined by the Plan
          Administrator in its sole and exclusive judgment, the provision shall be
          considered ambiguous and shall be interpreted by the Plan Administrator and all
          Plan fiduciaries in a fashion consistent with its intent, as determined in the
          sole and exclusive judgment of the Plan Administrator. The Plan Administrator
          shall amend the Plan retroactively to cure any such ambiguity. </FONT></P>
