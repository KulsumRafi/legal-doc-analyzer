      (e)   due to a Qualified Retirement (as defined below), the following
            provisions shall apply (subject in all cases to Section 5(e)(v)
            hereof):

            (i)   if and to the extent that any Option Installment (as defined
                  below) has vested and is exercisable as of the Qualified
                  Retirement Date (as defined below), such Option Installment
                  shall not terminate upon the retirement of the Optionee, but
                  may be exercised by the Optionee, in whole or in part, at any
                  time between the Qualified Retirement Date and the Expiration
                  Date applicable thereto;

            (ii)  subject to Section 5(e)(iii) hereof, if and to the extent that
                  any Option Installment is not vested and exercisable as of the
                  Qualified Retirement Date, such Option Installment (A) shall
                  remain in effect with respect to fifty percent (50%) of the
                  Common Shares covered thereby and, as to such Common Shares,
                  shall vest and become exercisable on the Vesting Date
                  applicable thereto and may be exercised by the Optionee, in

                  by such Option Installment;

            (iii) notwithstanding Section 5(e)(ii) above, if and to the extent
                  that any Option Installment is not vested and exercisable as
                  of the Qualified Retirement Date, but has a Vesting Date which
                  is no later than four (4) months after the Qualified
                  Retirement Date, then, notwithstanding the Optionee's
                  retirement, the Option Installment which is scheduled to vest
                  on such Vesting Date shall remain in effect, shall vest on
                  such Vesting Date and may be exercised by the Optionee, in
                  whole or in part, at any time between such Vesting Date and
                  the applicable Expiration Date;

            (iv)  if the Optionee dies after the date of his or her retirement
                  and has not exercised the Option, in whole or in part, prior
                  to his or her death, the Optionee's estate shall have the
                  right to exercise the Option as to (A) all Common Shares, if
                  any, as to which the Option has vested and is exercisable as
                  of the date of the Optionee's death, plus (B) the additional
                  Common Shares, if any, as to which the Option would have
                  become exercisable within one (1) year from the date of the
                  Optionee's death pursuant to Sections 5 (e)(ii) and/or (iii)
                  hereof, as applicable, but for the death of the Optionee, at
                  any time during the one (1) year period beginning on the date

                  of the date of the Optionee's death;
