registration requirements of the securities act, subject to the sponsor's and
the trust's right prior to any such offer, sale or transfer to require the

whose underlying assets include "plan assets" by reason of any plan's investment
in the entity, and no person investing "plan assets" of any plan may acquire or
hold the securities or any interest therein, unless such purchaser or holder is
eligible for exemptive relief available under u.s. department of labor

                           REVERSE OF CAPITAL SECURITY

         Distributions payable on each Capital Security will be payable at an
annual rate equal to 5.220% beginning on (and including) the date of original
issuance and ending on (but excluding) December 26, 2002 and at an annual rate
for each successive period beginning on (and including) December 26, 2002, and
each succeeding Distribution Payment Date, and ending on (but excluding) the
next succeeding Distribution Payment Date (each a "Distribution Period"), equal
to 3-Month LIBOR, determined as described below, plus 3.400% (the "Coupon
Rate"); provided, however, that prior to September 26, 2007, the Coupon Rate
shall not exceed 11.90%, applied to the stated liquidation amount of $1,000.00
per Capital Security, such rate being the rate of interest payable on the
Debentures to be held by the Institutional Trustee. Distributions in arrears for
more than a quarterly period will bear interest thereon compounded quarterly at
the Distribution Rate (to the extent permitted by applicable law). The term
"Distributions" as used herein includes payments of Interest and any principal
on the Debentures held by the Institutional Trustee unless otherwise stated. A
Distribution is payable only to the extent that payments are made in respect of
the Debentures held by the Institutional Trustee and to the extent the
Institutional Trustee has funds available therefor. As used herein,
"Determination Date" means the date that is two London Banking Days (i.e., a
business day in which dealings in deposits in U.S. dollars are transacted in the
London interbank market) preceding the commencement of the relevant Distribution
Period. In the event that any date on which a Distribution is payable on this
Capital Security is not a Business Day, then a payment of the Distribution
payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day which is a Business
Day (and without any Distribution or other payment in respect of any such
delay), except that, if such Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar
year, such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day, in
each case with the same force and effect as if made on the date the payment was
originally payable. The amount of interest payable for any Distribution Period
will be calculated by applying the Coupon Rate to the principal amount
outstanding at the commencement of the Distribution Period and multiplying each
such amount by the actual number of days in the Distribution Period concerned
divided by 360.

         "3-Month LIBOR" as used herein, means the London interbank offered
interest rate for three-month U.S. dollar deposits determined by the Debenture
Trustee in the following order of priority: (i) the rate (expressed as a
percentage per annum) for U.S. dollar deposits having a three-month maturity
that appears on Telerate Page 3750 as of 11:00 a.m. (London time) on the related
Determination Date ("Telerate Page 3750" means the display designated as "Page
3750" on the Dow Jones Telerate Service or such other page as may replace Page
3750 on that service or such other service or services as may be nominated by
the British Bankers' Association as the information vendor for the purpose of
displaying London interbank offered rates for U.S. dollar deposits); (ii) if
such rate cannot be identified on the related Determination Date, the Debenture
Trustee will request the principal London offices of four leading banks in the
London interbank market to provide such banks' offered quotations (expressed as
percentages per annum) to prime banks in the London interbank market for U.S.
dollar deposits having a three-month maturity as of 11:00 a.m. (London time) on
such Determination Date. If at least two quotations are provided, 3-Month LIBOR
will be the arithmetic mean of such quotations; (iii) if fewer than two such
quotations are provided as requested in clause (ii) above, the Debenture Trustee
will request four major New York City banks to provide such banks' offered
quotations (expressed as percentages per annum) to leading European banks for
loans in U.S. dollars as of 11:00 a.m. (London time) on such Determination Date.
If at least two such quotations are provided, 3-Month LIBOR will be the
arithmetic mean of such quotations; and (iv) if fewer than two such quotations
are provided as requested in clause (iii) above, 3-Month LIBOR will be a 3-Month
LIBOR determined with respect to the Distribution Period immediately preceding
such current Distribution Period. If the rate for U.S. dollar deposits having a
three-month maturity that initially appears on Telerate Page 3750 as of 11:00
a.m. (London time) on the related Determination Date is superseded on the
Telerate Page 3750 by a corrected rate by 12:00 noon (London time) on such
Determination Date, then the corrected rate as so substituted on the applicable
page will be the applicable 3-Month LIBOR for such Determination Date.

         The Coupon Rate for any Distribution Period will at no time be higher
than the maximum rate then permitted by New York law as the same may be modified
by United States law.

         All percentages resulting from any calculations on the Capital
Securities will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred-thousandth
of a percentage point, with five one-millionths of a percentage point rounded
upward (e.g., 9.876545% or .09876545 being rounded to 9.87655% or .0987655, and
all dollar amounts used in or resulting from such calculation will be rounded to
the nearest cent (with one-half cent being rounded upward)).

         Except as otherwise described below, Distributions on the Capital
Securities will be cumulative, will accrue from the date of original issuance
and will be payable quarterly in arrears on March 26, June 26, September 26 and
December 26 of each year, commencing on December 26, 2002. The Debenture Issuer
has the right under the Indenture to defer payments of interest on the
Debentures by extending the interest payment period for up to 20 consecutive
quarterly periods (each an "Extension Period") on the Debentures, subject to the
conditions described below, although such interest would continue to accrue on
the Debentures at an annual rate equal to the Distribution Rate compounded
quarterly to the extent permitted by law during any Extension Period. No
Extension Period may end on a date other than a Distribution Payment Date. At
the end of any such Extension Period the Debenture Issuer shall pay all interest
then accrued and unpaid on the Debentures (together with Additional Interest
thereon); provided, however, that no Extension Period may extend beyond the
Maturity Date. Prior to the termination of any Extension Period, the Debenture
Issuer may further extend such period, provided that such period together with
all such previous and further consecutive extensions thereof shall not exceed 20
consecutive quarterly periods, or extend beyond the Maturity Date. Upon the
termination of any Extension Period and upon the payment of all accrued and
unpaid interest and Additional Interest, the Debenture Issuer may commence a new
Extension Period, subject to the foregoing requirements. No interest or
Additional Interest shall be due and payable during an Extension Period, except
at the end thereof, but each installment of interest that would otherwise have
been due and payable during such Extension Period shall bear Additional
Interest. If Distributions are deferred, the Distributions due shall be paid on
the date that the related Extension Period terminates, to Holders of the
Securities as they appear on the books and records of the Trust on the record
date immediately preceding such date. Distributions on the Securities must be
paid on the dates payable (after giving effect to any Extension Period) to the
extent that the Trust has funds available for the payment of such distributions
in the Property Account of the Trust. The Trust's funds available for
Distribution to the Holders of the Securities will be limited to payments
received from the Debenture Issuer. The payment of Distributions out of moneys
held by the Trust is guaranteed by the Guarantor pursuant to the Guarantee.

         The Capital Securities shall be redeemable as provided in the
Declaration.
