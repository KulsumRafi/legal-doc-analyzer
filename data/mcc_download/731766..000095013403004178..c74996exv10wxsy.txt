                      United HealthCare Insurance Company

                    American Association of Retired Persons

                      Trustees of the AARP Insurance Plan

                              AARP Services, Inc.


         This ASSIGNMENT is made and entered into as of the 28th day of
December, 1999, by and between the American Association of Retired Persons
("AARP"), the Trustees of the AARP Insurance Plan ("AARP Trust"), United
HealthCare Insurance Company ("United"), and AARP Services, Inc. ("Services").


                                   WITNESSETH


         WHEREAS, AARP has made available to its members a group Medicare
supplement, hospital indemnity and certain other medical insurance coverages and
other products from United (the "Program"); and

         WHEREAS, the Program is presently being made available pursuant to an
Agreement between the parties dated as of February 26, 1997 (the "United
Agreement"); and

         WHEREAS, AARP is desirous of restructuring its operational structure
whereby certain activities formerly conducted by AARP, including performance of
quality control operations, monitoring of service providers, and granting third
parties use of the AARP Mailing List, will in the future be conducted by
Services and no longer be conducted by AARP; and

         WHEREAS, AARP and United desire to assign certain of their respective
rights and obligations relating to quality control, monitoring and the AARP
Membership Information as set
<PAGE>
out in the United Agreement to Services, a wholly-owned subsidiary of AARP,
which subsidiary will carry out these activities formerly carried out by AARP.

NOW THEREFORE, IT IS AGREED:

1)   Attached hereto as Exhibit A is a copy of the United Agreement between
     AARP, the AARP Trust, and United effective as of February 26, 1997. By this
     Assignment, AARP assigns all of its rights, title and interests in such
     Agreement as they relate to quality control, monitoring and the AARP
     Membership Information, to Services, saving and excepting to itself those
     rights, title and interests contained in the Agreement relating to the
     exclusive right of AARP to its name, symbol, mark, logos, and acronym (the
     "AARP Marks") and the right of AARP to receive a royalty for the use of the
     AARP Marks. The Definitions as set out in Article 2 of the United Agreement
     are incorporated herein by reference to the extent that such Definitions
     are applicable. All other provisions of the United Agreement not assigned
     shall remain as set out in the United Agreement and shall control to the
     extent consistent with the terms of this Assignment.

2)   The allowances determined in accordance with Section 6.1 of the United
     Agreement and payable in accordance with Section 6.7 of the United
     Agreement shall be payable under the same terms and conditions by United to
     AARP.

3)   AARP hereby assigns and transfers to Services:

     a)  All of its rights, title and interests in the United Agreement as they
         relate to quality control and monitoring of the use by United of the
         AARP Marks.

    (b)  A license to use and sublicense the AARP names, addresses, and member
         identification number(s) (the "Membership Information").



                                      -2-

<PAGE>


     c)  Nothing herein shall be interpreted as AARP assigning those rights,
         title and interests contained in the United Agreement relating to the
         exclusive right of AARP to the AARP Marks and the right of AARP to
         receive a royalty for the use of the AARP Marks.

     d)  All rights, title and interests not assigned by this Assignment shall
         remain as set out in the United Agreement and shall control to the
         extent consistent with the terms of this Assignment.

4)   It is intent of the parties hereto that the payment made by United to AARP
     pursuant to the United Agreement and referred to as an allowance is a
     royalty and pursuant to this Assignment and the agreement referred to in
     this paragraph, the royalty is to be bifurcated into a payment to AARP
     Services for Quality Control and monitoring and to AARP for use of the AARP
     Marks. AARP shall grant United an exclusive license to use the AARP Marks
     by separate agreement. Such separate agreement shall obligate United to
     compensate AARP for the use of its intangible property by the payment of a
     royalty. A copy of such separate agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit B.

5)   The quality control, monitoring and AARP Membership Information rights and
     obligations set out in the United Agreement which are hereby transferred to
     Services are as follows:

     a)  Quality Control: Services shall be responsible for ensuring that United
         maintains all of the standards and meets all of the requirements set
         out in the United Agreement. Services shall be subject to the
         obligations of AARP contained therein. All reports required of United
         formerly to have been provided to AARP shall be provided by United to
         Services.


                                      -3-
<PAGE>
         b)   Monitoring: An activity of Quality Control consisting of the
              overseeing of operations as called for in the United Agreement.

         c)   Any and all rights of United to the AARP Membership Information
              are hereby transferred from AARP to Services. AARP has licensed
              the use of its member mailing list and Membership Information to
              Services by separate agreement with the right of Services to
              sublicense such information. Services hereby grants to United all
              rights to the Membership Information formerly granted to United by
              AARP pursuant to the United Agreement. Any and all approvals
              required of AARP as to the use of the Membership Information
              pursuant to the United Agreement shall be requested by United from
              Services.

         d)   All rights of United as to the Membership Information remain as
              they are set out in the United Agreement, with such rights to be
              provided by Services. United acknowledges Services as the
              successor to AARP for all purposes relating to Membership
              Information. Nothing in this Assignment Agreement shall grant to
              Services or United any rights whatsoever as to the AARP Marks.

6)       United shall pay to Services the sum of the following amounts as
         compensation:

         a)   For Membership Information, during the term of this Assignment,
              United shall pay to Services an amount equal to eight percent (8%)
              of the amount computed pursuant to Article 6 of the United
              Agreement.

         b)   For Quality Control services, United shall pay to Services an
              amount equal to Services' costs to perform such services, plus ten
              percent (10%). Services shall bill United for these services and
              payment shall be made within thirty (30) days.




                                      -4-
<PAGE>
         7)   Notices required or appropriate to be given under this Agreement

Accordingly, Provider shall at no time and in no medium or manner state or
imply that the AARP has any such interest in or connection with, Provider or

this Agreement shall be held to be prohibited or invalid, such provision shall
be ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without
invalidating the remainder of such provision or the remaining provisions of this
Agreement. No failure on the part of any party to exercise, and no delay in
exercising, any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any
single or partial exercise of any right hereunder by any party preclude any
other or further exercise of any other right and no waiver whatever shall be
valid unless in a signed writing, and then only to the extent specifically set
forth in such writing. No waiver of any right hereunder shall operate as a
waiver of any other or of the same or similar right on another occasion.

not part of this Agreement, are for the convenience of reference only and shall
not affect the meaning, construction or interpretation of this Agreement.

             FOURTH AMENDMENT TO THE AARP HEALTH INSURANCE AGREEMENT



         This Fourth Amendment to the AARP Health Insurance Agreement (this
"Amendment"), dated as of December 18, 2001 (the "Effective Date"), is made by
and between AARP Services, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("ASI") and United
HealthCare Insurance Company, a Delaware corporation ("United"). The parties
hereto shall collectively be referred to as the "Parties."

                                    RECITALS

         A. The AARP, the Trustees of the AARP Insurance Plan, and United are
parties to a certain AARP Health Insurance Agreement dated as of February 26,
1997 (the "Original Agreement").

         B. The Original Agreement was first amended effective January 1, 1998,
to address the Medicare Select product (the "First Amendment").

         C. The Original Agreement was also amended effective January 1, 1998,
to address the Health Care Options Pharmacy Service offered to SHIP Pharmacy
Insureds (the "Second Amendment").

         D. By subsequent amendment and assignment on December 28, 1999, AARP,
AARP Trust and United agreed to the assignment to and assumption by ASI of
certain rights and obligations (the "Third Amendment").

         E. The Original Agreement and its subsequent amendments shall
hereinafter collectively be referred to as the "Agreement." Capitalized terms
not defined in this Amendment but defined in the Agreement shall have the
meanings set out therein.

         F. Since the execution of the Agreement, United, ASI and its
consultants have worked together to develop certain Developed Systems to support
the administration of the SHIP



                                       1

<PAGE>

Plans and the provision of Services, the costs of which were approved by ASI and
charged to the SHIP. The Developed Systems are set forth in more detail on
Exhibit 7.7.2 hereto.

         G. Section 7.7.2 of the Agreement provides that the Developed Systems
are to be owned as agreed among the Parties. In accordance with Section 7.7.2,
the Parties desire to provide a clear delineation of the rights of the Parties
with respect to the Developed Systems, as more fully set forth in this
Amendment.

         Now, therefore, the Parties agree as follows:

         A. Article 7 of the Agreement is amended by the addition of the
following subsections 7.7.2.1 through 7.7.2.5:

                  7.7.2.1. Approval. United shall not, alone or in conjunction
         with any other person or entity, license, sell or otherwise utilize the
         Developed Systems for the purpose of enabling or facilitating the
         provision of any service or product other than in connection with the
         SHIP without the prior written approval of ASI, such approval not to be
         unreasonably withheld.

                  7.7.2.2. Use of Developed Systems involving a Directly
         Competitive Service or Product Prohibited. United shall not, alone or
         in conjunction with any other person or entity, license, sell or
         otherwise utilize the Developed Systems for the purpose of enabling or
         facilitating the provision of any Directly Competitive Service or
         Product, unless the Parties mutually agree otherwise. A "Directly
         Competitive Service or Product" means the following services and
         products offered to or through any other




                                       2
<PAGE>

         group (other than AARP and its subsidiaries): Medicare supplement
         insurance, supplemental medical insurance, supplemental hospital
         indemnity insurance, long term care insurance, dental insurance,
         pharmacy services, vision services and any other services or products
         upon which the Parties mutually agree.

                  7.7.2.3. Compensation. The Parties hereby agree that a
         licensing fee shall be paid for any use, sale or license of the
         Developed Systems that is approved by ASI. The licensing fee shall be
         reimbursed to the SHIP in consideration of its capital investment in
         the Developed Systems. The amount of the licensing fee shall be as the
         Parties mutually agree and may take into account the following
         criteria: (a) utilization of hardware capacity (e.g., servers, computer
         systems, and network hardware) comprising the Developed Systems, (b)
         utilization of software capacity (e.g., database management systems,
         and modeling algorithms) comprising the Developed Systems, (c) direct
         expense of engineering resources comprising the Developed Systems, (d)
         direct expense of design resources comprising the Developed Systems and
         (e) consideration of the size or scope of the project involving the
         Developed Systems.

                  7.7.2.4. Budgetary Considerations. All costs, fees, and future
         funding provided with respect to the development of the Developed
         Systems shall be governed by ASI's budget and approval process for the
         SHIP; provided, however, that any such costs, fees, and funding which
         are required for the SHIP due to an Event of Force Majeure shall not be
         withheld.




                                       3
<PAGE>

                  7.7.2.5. Future Development. United may at any time
         independently develop systems, notwithstanding any prior exposure by
         its engineering team to the Developed Systems. However, unless approved
         by ASI pursuant to subsection 7.7.2.1 above, United may not utilize the
         proprietary customized source code and object code, hardware, custom
         software, copyrighted material and/or patented technology comprising
         the Developed Systems, except for the know-how, processes, and other
         intellectual property, including patentable or copyrightable materials
         developed, owned or possessed by United's contractors and embedded in,
         underlying or constituting a part of the Developed Systems, the right,
         title and interest of which did not pass to United.


                  B. Exhibit 7.7.2 is revised to read as set forth in the
         attached Exhibit 7.7.2, which is hereby incorporated by reference as
         the new Exhibit 7.7.2.

                  C. This Amendment shall survive termination of the Agreement;
         however, this Amendment does not supercede the termination provisions
         of Article 10.

         IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Amendment to be
executed by their duly authorized officers as of the date first set forth above.

             FIFTH AMENDMENT TO THE AARP HEALTH INSURANCE AGREEMENT


         AARP Services, Inc. ("ASI") and United HealthCare Insurance Company
("United") hereby agree to this Fifth Amendment of the AARP Health Insurance
Agreement entered into and dated as of February 26, 1997, and subsequently
amended, as set forth below:

A.       Article 2 of the Agreement is amended by the addition of the following
         Sections 2.126, 2.127 and 2.128:

         "2.126. AARP HealthLine Services means the services offered by United
         to SHIP Medicare Supplement Insureds as described in subsection
         3.2.2(i) and Exhibit 3.2.2(i) of the Agreement.

         2.127. AARP HealthLine Claim Savings means the savings, expressed in
         dollars, derived from SHIP Medicare Supplement Insureds' utilization of
         AARP HealthLine Services. This is calculated using a model described in
         Exhibit 2.127 hereto that is based on differences in level of service
         between an individual's intention regarding care before calling to the
         care that the individual actually received after calling, as verified
         through aggregate reporting to ASI.

         2.128. SHIP Medicare Supplement Insured means an individual who is
         insured under any SHIP Plan that is a Medicare supplement insurance
         plan, including prestandardized and standardized Medicare Supplement
         insurance and Medicare Select."


B.       Subsection 3.2.2(g) of the Agreement is deleted in its entirety and
         replaced with the following:

         "3.2.2(g).  Reserved."


C.       Subsection 3.2.2 of the Agreement is amended by the addition of new
         subparagraph (i) to read as follows:

         "(i) United shall make available to all SHIP Medicare Supplement
         Insureds access to the AARP HealthLine Services. The AARP HealthLine
         Services are set forth in Exhibit 3.2.2(i) which is attached hereto and

D.       (2) Program Performance Evaluation. United shall conduct a program
         performance evaluation beginning at 18 months following the effective

         Insureds; cross referrals into other AARP Health Care Options products;

         (3) Training. United shall develop and implement, to the satisfaction
         of ASI, training for employees supporting the AARP HealthLine Services,

         Services and areas of special concern when dealing with senior
         sensitivity and mature customers.

         (4) Reports. United shall provide monthly and quarterly reports to ASI,

         to monitor and evaluate program performance. These reports shall
         include, but are not limited to reports on utilization of service,
         customer service, satisfaction, marketing results and analysis, and an

         Care Options review and approval process for all written or scripted

         shall be disseminated to SHIP Medicare Supplement Insureds or the
         general AARP membership describing the AARP HealthLine Services
         ("Promotional Materials"). United shall use the product name designated
         by ASI when providing AARP HealthLine Services under this Agreement.

         (6) Additional Promotional Materials. In addition to the communications
         described in subsection 3.2.2(i)(5) above, United shall communicate in
         writing the availability and benefits of the AARP HealthLine Services
         at least two (2) times per year through the following Promotional
         Materials ("Additional Promotional Materials"): welcome packet and
         reminder postcards or other mailings. United shall receive *** for each
         active SHIP Medicare Supplement Insured per month for the term of this
         Amendment to produce and mail the Additional Promotional Materials.
         This charge is in addition to the compensation set forth in section
         6.11."

         (7) Subcontract. Certain of the AARP HealthLine Services shall be

         material breach by another party, provided that such breach has not

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY INFORMATION
OF OPTUM

                            AARP HealthLine Services

OPTUM RETURN ON INVESTMENT (ROI) ESTIMATION MODEL

A comprehensive and yet conservative approach is used to estimate a financial
return on investment for purchasers of Optum services. This approach creates a
dynamic computer-based actuarial model in spreadsheet format. The model uses
both default parameters derived from market segmented analysis of Optum's book
of business and customized parameters based upon the specific purchaser's
experience. The model's methodology is based on several years of research
development including empirical claims, clinical process, and survey studies.
Independent industry consultants have favorably reviewed this methodology.


WHAT DOES THE ROI MODEL MEASURE?

There are two principal components of economic return in the model that are
relevant to AARP HealthLine Services. These are "Care-path methodology"
(referred to as care-path) claims associated outcomes and service intervention
values.


1. Care-path Claims Associated Outcomes


This component of the model recognizes that symptom-based triage callers sort
into three basic clinical paths as a result of their interaction with Optum.
Care-path outcomes are measured using a two part longitudinal methodology. ***

***

***

***


2. Optum Service Intervention Value

This component addresses the value of Optum services that fall outside of
claims-associated savings. It is derived from conservative estimates of the cost
to provide these services if the customer were to build or buy a capability
equivalent to Optum. Types of services include health information nurse,
clinical updates, audio library, and administrative assistance and member
referrals.

                         How Valid is the ROI Estimate?

This is an estimation model used as a standardized tool for reporting ROI.
Comprehensive investigation of a population's actual health care claims
experience is very costly and difficult. Thus, it is not feasible to conduct
full-scale empirical investigations of the ROI factors on a routine basis for
customers. As an alternative, we use an empirical research base to guide the
assumptions underlying ROI estimates. Additionally, most variables in the model
can accept customer specific input values. Most importantly, the customer's
actual Optum utilization experience and Optum program costs are factored into
this ROI estimate.
