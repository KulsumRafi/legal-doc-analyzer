No.&nbsp;11, dated as of December&nbsp;30, 2002 (as amended, modified, waived, supplemented, or restated from time to time, the "<U>Loan Funding and Servicing
Agreement</U>"), by and among the Borrower, American Capital Strategies,&nbsp;Ltd., as servicer, Variable Funding Capital Corporation, as a lender, the Investors named therein, Wells
Fargo Bank Minnesota, National Association (f/k/a Norwest Bank Minnesota, National Association), as backup servicer and as collateral custodian, the Deal Agent, and Wachovia Bank, National Association
(f/k/a First Union National Bank), as a lender and as liquidity agent. Capitalized terms used but not defined in this VFCC Structured Note are used with the meanings ascribed to them in the Loan

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding
any other provisions contained in this VFCC Structured Note, if at any time the Interest Rate payable by the Paying Agent on behalf of the Borrower under this VFCC
Structured Note, when combined with any and all other charges provided for in this VFCC Structured Note, in the
Loan Funding and Servicing Agreement or in any other document (to the extent such other charges would constitute interest for the purpose of any applicable law limiting interest that may be charged on
this VFCC Structured Note), exceeds the highest rate of interest permissible under applicable law (the "<U>Maximum Lawful Rate</U>"), then so long as the Maximum Lawful Rate
would be exceeded the Interest Rate under this VFCC Structured Note shall be equal to the Maximum Lawful Rate. If at any time thereafter the Interest Rate payable under this VFCC Structured Note is
less than the Maximum Lawful Rate, the Paying Agent on behalf of the Borrower shall continue to pay Interest under this VFCC Structured Note at the Maximum Lawful Rate until such time as the total
Interest paid by the Paying Agent on behalf of the Borrower is equal to the total Interest that would have been paid had applicable law not limited the Interest Rate payable under this VFCC Structured
Note. In no event shall the total Interest received by the Lenders under this VFCC Structured Note exceed the amount which such Lenders could lawfully have received had the Interest due under this
VFCC Structured Note been calculated since the date of this VFCC Structured Note at the Maximum Lawful Rate. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Payments
of the principal of, and Interest on, the Advances by the Lenders and represented by this VFCC Structured Note shall be made by the Paying Agent on behalf of the Borrower to the

VFCC Structured Note or the making of any notation on this VFCC Structured Note. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
any payment under this VFCC Structured Note falls due on a day that is not a Business Day, then such due date shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day and Interest shall
be payable on any principal so extended at the applicable Interest Rate. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
all or a portion of (i)&nbsp;the principal amount hereof or (ii)&nbsp;any Interest payable thereon or (iii)&nbsp;any other amounts payable hereunder shall not be paid when due
(whether at maturity, by acceleration or otherwise), such overdue amount shall bear Interest at a rate per annum that is equal to the Base Rate <U>plus</U> 1.0%, in each case
from the date of such non-payment to (but excluding) the date such amount is paid in full. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Portions
