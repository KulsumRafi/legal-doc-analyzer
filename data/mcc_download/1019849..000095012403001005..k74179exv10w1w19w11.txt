         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and for other good and

acknowledged), the parties hereto agree as follows:

         SECTION 1 AMENDMENT. As of the Amendment Effective Date, Section 9.7(l)
of the Credit Agreement shall be amended and restated in its entirety to read as
follows:

                  "(l) Debt of the U.K. Target and its Subsidiaries (other than

earlier date); (b) no Event of Default or Unmatured Event of Default exists or
will result from the execution of this Amendment; (c) no event or circumstance
has occurred since the Effective Date that has resulted, or would reasonably be
expected to result, in a Material Adverse Effect; (d) the execution and delivery
by the Company of this Amendment and the performance by the Company of its
obligations under the Credit Agreement as amended hereby (as so amended, the
"Amended Credit Agreement") (i) are within the corporate powers of the Company,
(ii) have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action, (iii) have
received all necessary approval from any governmental authority and (iv) do not
and will not contravene or conflict with any provision of any law, rule or
regulation or any order, decree, judgment or award which is binding on the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or of any provision of the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws or other organizational documents of the Company or of
any agreement, indenture, instrument or other document which is binding on the

principles relating to enforceability.

         SECTION 3 EFFECTIVENESS. The amendment set forth in Section 1 above
shall become effective as of March 12, 2002 (the "Amendment Effective Date") on
such date when the Agent shall have received (a) a counterpart of this Amendment
executed by the Company and the Required Lenders (or, in the case of any party
other than the Company from which the Agent has not received a counterpart
hereof, facsimile confirmation of the execution of a counterpart hereof by such
party) and (b) each of the following documents, each in form and substance
satisfactory to the Agent:

         3.1 Reaffirmation. A counterpart of the Reaffirmation of Loan

other than the Company.

         3.2 Other Documents. Such other documents as the Agent or any Lender
may reasonably request.

         SECTION 4  MISCELLANEOUS.

         4.1 Continuing Effectiveness, etc. As hereby amended, the Credit
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and is hereby ratified and
confirmed in all respects. As of the Amendment Effective Date, all references in

document to the "Credit Agreement" or similar terms shall refer to the Amended
Credit Agreement.

         4.2 Counterparts. This Amendment may be executed in any number of
counterparts and by the different parties on separate counterparts, and each
such counterpart shall be deemed to be an original but all such counterparts
shall together constitute one and the same Amendment.

         4.3 Expenses. The Company agrees to pay the reasonable costs and
expenses of the Agent (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel,
including, without duplication, the allocable costs of internal legal services
and all disbursements of internal legal counsel) in connection with the
preparation, execution and delivery of this Amendment.

         4.4 Governing Law. This Amendment shall be a contract made under and
governed by the laws of the State of New York applicable to contracts made and
