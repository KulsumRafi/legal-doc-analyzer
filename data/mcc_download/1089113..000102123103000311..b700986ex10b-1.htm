<p><font size=2 face="serif">Unless otherwise required by the Companies Act or
  the Articles, holders of Shares vote by ordinary resolution at general meetings
  for the election of directors, the declaration of dividends, the appointment
  of auditors, an increase of authorised share capital or the grant of authority
  to allot shares.</font></p>

    &#145;Restrictions on voting&#146; below and any special voting rights or
    restrictions attached to any class of shares, </font><font size=2 face="serif">ordinary
    resolutions will be decided on a show of hands by a simple majority of shareholders
    present and voting at the meeting where each shareholder has one vote, regardless
    of the number of Shares held, unless a poll is demanded. On a poll, every
    holder who is present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote shall have
    one vote for every Share held. Holders of record of Shares may appoint a proxy
    to attend and vote on their behalf.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="serif">The chairman of the meeting has the casting vote
    in the event of a tie in either a show of hands or poll vote, in addition
    to any other vote he may have.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="serif">HSBC Holdings will send out written notice at
    least 21 clear days before an annual general meeting or an extraordinary general
    meeting convened to consider a special or extraordinary resolution, and at
    least 14 clear days before all other extraordinary general meetings. For general
    meetings to be valid, at least three holders of Shares entitled to vote must
    be present in person or by proxy.</font></p>
</div>
<p><font size=2 face="serif"><i>Disclosure of interests in Shares</i></font></p>
<p><font size=2 face="serif">The Companies Act gives HSBC Holdings the power to
  require persons who it believes to be, or to have been within the previous three
  years, interested in its Shares, to disclose prescribed particulars of those
  interests. Failure to supply the information required may lead to disenfranchisement
  of the relevant Shares and, where those Shares represent at least 0.25 per cent
  of the Shares in issue of a class, a prohibition on their transfer and receipt
  of dividends and other payments in respect of those Shares. In this context,
  the term &#145;interest&#146; is broadly defined and will generally include
  an interest of any kind whatsoever in Shares, including the interest of a holder
  of an HSBC Holdings ADS.</font></p>
<p><font size=2 face="serif"><i>Restrictions on voting</i></font></p>
<p><font size=2 face="serif">Any holder of Shares (or any other person appearing
  to be interested in the Shares) who has been served with a notice pursuant to
  the Companies Act as described above, and has not given HSBC Holdings the information
  required by the notice within the prescribed period from the date of receiving
  the notice, will not be entitled to be present or to vote either personally
  or by proxy at a general meeting unless the Directors determine that this restriction
  should not apply.</font></p>
<div style="text-indent:3%">
  <p><font size="2" face="serif">A holder of Shares can vote (whether in person
    or by proxy) and exercise other rights or privileges as a holder of Shares
    only if he has paid all calls or other amounts presently due unless the board
    otherwise determines.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="serif">There are no limitations imposed by UK law or
    the Articles on the rights of holders of Shares who are not</font> <font size=2 face="serif">UK

  <font size=2 face="serif"><i>Dividends and other distributions</i></font> </div>
<p><font size=2 face="serif">HSBC Holdings may, by ordinary resolution, declare
  dividends, but it may not pay dividends in excess of the amount recommended
  by the Directors. Except as otherwise provided by the terms of issue or special
  rights of any Shares, dividends are declared and paid according to the amounts
  paid on the Shares. HSBC Holdings may pay interim dividends. Dividends declared
  but not yet paid do not bear interest. The Board may deduct from any dividend
  declared but not yet paid to any person any amounts due from that person to
  HSBC Holdings on account of calls or otherwise in relation to the Shares. The
  Directors may, if authorised by an ordinary resolution, offer holders of Shares
  the right to elect to receive Shares instead of cash for the whole or any part
  of any dividend specified by the ordinary resolution. The Board can forfeit
  the right of a holder of Shares to a dividend that remains unclaimed for 12
  years. Dividends with respect to HSBC Holdings&#146; ADSs will be paid in US
  dollars and the depositary will distribute them to the holders of HSBC Holdings&#146;
  ADSs.</font></p>
<div style="text-indent:3%">
  <p><font size="2" face="serif">The right of the holders of Shares to the payment
    of a dividend from the profits of HSBC Holdings is subject to the prior right
    to the payment of a dividend from the profits of HSBC Holdings of the holders,
    if any, of the Sterling Preference Shares, the Dollar Preference Shares and
    the Euro Preference Shares (together, the &#145;Preference Shares&#146;).</font></p>
</div>
<p><font size=2 face="serif"><i>Liquidation</i></font></p>
<p><font size=2 face="serif">If HSBC Holdings is wound up, after payment of all
  liabilities, including the payment to any holders of HSBC Holdings Preference
  Shares of their rights in liquidation and the deduction of any provision made
  under section 719 of the Companies Act or section 187 of the Insolvency Act
  1986 (which enables the liquidator to make payments to employees or former employees
  on the cessation or transfer of HSBC Holdings&#146; business), the remaining
  assets available for distribution to holders of the Shares will be distributed
  among them in proportion to the number of Shares held by each. On the date of
  the distribution, the amount paid to any holder of Shares who has not fully
  paid for his Shares will be reduced to reflect the amount unpaid. After receiving
  approval of the holders of the Shares by an extraordinary resolution and meeting
  any other legal requirements, the liquidator may divide the assets in kind among
  the holders of the Shares in the manner that it sees fit.</font></p>
<p><font size=2 face="serif"><i>Untraced shareholders</i></font></p>
<p><font size=2 face="serif">HSBC Holdings can sell any Share (including any further
  share issued in respect of that Share) if the holder has not cashed any cheque,
  order or warrant payable and HSBC Holdings has not received any communication
  in respect of the Share from the relevant holder (or other person entitled to
  the Share) for a period of 12 years during which at least three dividends were
  payable with respect to the Share. HSBC Holdings must advertise its intention
  to sell the Share in newspapers published in the United Kingdom and in Hong
  Kong (in the manner specified in the Articles) and inform the London Stock Exchange
  and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange of the same.</font></p>
<div style="text-indent:3%">
  <p><font size="2" face="serif">HSBC Holdings may then sell the Shares if it
    does not receive any response from the holder of the Shares within three months
    of publishing the advertisements. After selling the Shares, HSBC Holdings
    will owe the former holder of the Shares (or other person previously entitled
    to the Share) only the sale amount, without interest.</font></p>

    permitted or required by Regulations and the relevant system. HSBC Holdings
    cannot refuse to register uncertificated Shares for failure to comply with

    in a class, or the sanction by the shareholders of that class of an extraordinary
    resolution passed at a separate general meeting, is required to vary or abrogate
    the rights of the class, unless otherwise provided by the terms of issue of
    the Shares of that class. Two persons holding or representing by proxy at
    least one-third of the Shares of the relevant class must be present for the

  <p><font size=2 face="serif"><i>Lien on shares</i></font></p>
  <p><font size=2 face="serif">HSBC Holdings has a lien on Shares which are not
    fully paid and for which payment is due (to the extent permitted by the Companies
    Act). The Board may waive the lien in whole or in part, or temporarily, and

    be made with 14 clear days&#146; notice specifying the time, place and manner
    of payment, which may include payment in instalments. The person on whom a
    call is made remains liable for the call despite any subsequent transfer of
