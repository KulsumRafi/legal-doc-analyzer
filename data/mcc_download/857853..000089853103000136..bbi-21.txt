 2.7  Merger Total Consideration Adjustments.
      ---------------------------------------

     (a)  Promptly following the receipt by Blackhawk of the materials described
in Section 3.4(a) for the month ending on the DunC Closing Capital Measurement
Date, DunC and Blackhawk and, if requested, their respective accountants and
other advisors, shall attempt to agree on the amount of the DunC Closing
Capital.  Along with such materials, DunC shall provide Blackhawk with its good
faith calculation of the amount of the DunC Closing Capital (the "First
Estimated DunC Closing Capital").  In the event DunC and Blackhawk agree on the
amount of the DunC Closing Capital, the Merger Total Consideration shall be
adjusted in accordance with subsection (c) below.

     (b)  In the event that Blackhawk and DunC are unable to agree on the amount
of the DunC Closing Capital within ten (10) days following Blackhawk's receipt
of the materials described in subsection (a) above, the Closing shall proceed on
the basis of the DunC Closing Capital as determined in good faith by Blackhawk
(the "Second Estimated DunC Closing Capital"), the Merger Total Consideration
shall be adjusted in accordance with subsection (c) below and the DunC Closing
Capital shall be finally determined in accordance with subsection (d) below.

     (c)  In the event that the DunC Closing Capital as agreed to by DunC and
Blackhawk pursuant to subsection (a) above or as determined by Blackhawk
pursuant to subsection (b) above is in excess of $4,782,000 (the "Upper DunC
Closing Capital Amount"), the Merger Total Consideration shall increase by $1.00
for each $1.00 of excess; provided, that, the increase in the
Merger Total Consideration shall not exceed $150,000 (the "Increase Cap").  If
the Closing has not occurred by September 1, 2003, the Increase Cap shall
increase by $25,000 for each month from September 1, 2003 through the Closing
Date.  In the event that the DunC Closing Capital as agreed to by DunC and
Blackhawk pursuant to subsection (a) above or as determined by Blackhawk
pursuant to subsection (b) above is less than $4,582,000 (the "Lower DunC
Closing Capital Amount"), the Merger Total Consideration shall decrease by
$1.538 for each $1.00 of shortfall.

     (d)  In the event the Blackhawk and DunC do not agree on the amount of the
DunC Closing Capital and the Closing proceeds pursuant to subsection (b) above,
the DunC Closing Capital shall be determined by an independent accounting firm
mutually acceptable to them.  If Blackhawk and DunC are unable to agree on the
choice of an accounting firm within ten (10) days following the Closing, they
will select a nationally recognized accounting firm by lot (after excluding any
such firm engaged by Blackhawk, DunC or their Affiliates) (the accounting firm
selected is referred to herein as the "Arbitrating Accountant").  Each party
will execute an engagement letter reasonably requested by the Arbitrating
Accountant.  Within ten (10) business days after the Arbitrating Accountants
have been retained, Blackhawk and DunC may deliver to the Arbitrating Accountant
and the other such information or documents it deems relevant to the calculation
of the DunC Closing Capital and shall also provide the Arbitrating Accountants
with such information and documents as the Arbitrating Accountants may request,
in each case with appropriate notices or copies being provided to the other
party.  Based on such submissions and any additional information or documents
requested by the Arbitrating Accountants, the Arbitrating Accountant in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement shall make a written determination
of the DunC Closing Capital no later than thirty (30) days following its
engagement and such determination will be conclusive and binding upon the
parties hereto; provided that the DunC Closing Capital as determined by the
Arbitrating Accountant shall not be greater than the First Estimated DunC
Closing Capital or less than the Second Estimated DunC Closing Capital.  The
fees of the Arbitrating Accountants shall be paid by Blackhawk, but fifty
percent (50%) of such fees shall be deducted from the DunC Closing Capital.  The
DunC Closing Capital as determined by the Arbitrating Accountant, is referred to
as the "Final DunC Closing Capital.

If the Final DunC Closing Capital is greater than the Second Estimated DunC
Closing Capital, then Blackhawk shall promptly pay to the Paying Agent the
following amount (the "Additional Capital Amount"):

               (A)  if the Second Estimated DunC Closing Capital and the Final
DunC Closing Capital are less than the Lower DunC Closing Capital Amount, then
$1.58 for each $1.00 by which the Second Estimated DunC Closing Capital is less
than the Final DunC Closing Capital;

               (B)  if the Second Estimated DunC Closing Capital is less than
the Lower DunC Closing Capital Amount and the Final DunC Closing Capital is
greater than the Lower DunC Closing Capital Amount, then (1) $1.58 for each
$1.00 by which the Second Estimated DunC Closing Capital is less than the Lower
DunC Closing Capital Amount and (2) $1.00 for each $1.00 by which the Final DunC
Closing Capital Amount is greater than the Upper DunC Closing Capital Amount, if
any; provided that the amount of the increase pursuant to (2) shall not exceed
the Increase Cap;

               (C)  if the Second Estimated DunC Closing Capital is greater than
the Lower DunC Closing Capital Amount but less than the Upper DunC Closing
Capital Amount and the Final DunC Closing Capital is greater than the Upper DunC
Closing Capital Amount, then $1.00 for each $1.00 by which the Final DunC
Closing Capital is greater than the Upper DunC Closing Capital Amount; provided
that the amount of such increase shall not exceed the Increase Cap;

               (D)  if the Second Estimated DunC Closing Capital and the Final
DunC Closing Capital are greater than the Upper DunC Closing Capital Amount,
then $1.00 for each $1.00 by which the Final DunC Closing Capital exceeds the
Second Estimated DunC Closing Capital; provided, that, the sum of the amount of
such increase and the amount of the increase to the Merger Total Consideration
pursuant to subsection (iii) above shall not exceed the Increase Cap; and

               (E)  in all other circumstances, the Additional Capital Amount
shall be $0.

 2.8  Conversion of DunC Common Stock.  At the Effective Time, and
      --------------------------------
without any action on the part of the holders thereof:

          (a)  Each share of Merger Stock shall be converted into the right to
receive cash in an amount equal to the Merger Per Share Consideration in the
manner and form, and on the terms and conditions, set forth in this Agreement.
All such shares of Merger Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each
certificate previously representing any such shares shall thereafter represent
the right to receive cash at the rate of the Merger Per Share Consideration.

          (b)  Each share of DunC Common Stock held in the treasury of DunC or
owned by DunC or any DunC Subsidiary for its own account (other than shares of
DunC Common Stock held directly or indirectly in trust accounts, managed
accounts and the like or otherwise held in a fiduciary capacity that are
beneficially owned by third parties) immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be canceled and extinguished without any conversion thereof and no payment
shall be made with respect thereto.

 2.9  Conversion of Stock of Merger Corp. At the Effective Time, each share
      -----------------------------------
of common stock of Merger Corp. then issued and outstanding, without any action
on the part of the holder thereof, shall be converted into one share of common
stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 2.10  Meeting of DunC Shareholders.
       -----------------------------

          (a)  DunC will promptly take all steps necessary to cause the DunC
Meeting to be duly called, noticed, and held as soon as practicable and, in any
event, no later than July 15, 2003 (unless postponed pursuant to Section 2.10(b)
hereof), for the purpose of voting to approve this Agreement, the Merger and all
matters related thereto.  Subject to Section 2.10(c) of this Agreement, DunC
will use its best efforts to secure the required approval of the DunC
Shareholders.

          (b)  In connection with the DunC Meeting, DunC will prepare and cause
to be mailed to the DunC Shareholders a notice of the Meeting and a definitive
proxy statement (together the "DunC Proxy Statement") as soon as practicable.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, mailing of the DunC Proxy Statement shall be
postponed until all of the conditions set forth in Sections 7.1(a) and 7.1(c) of
this Agreement have been satisfied, unless the parties mutually agree that said
mailing should be commenced notwithstanding that any one or more of such
conditions has not been satisfied.  In addition, the DunC Proxy Statement shall
include DunC's audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended
December 31, 2002 and no other financial statements for such year.

          Blackhawk and Merger Corp. shall provide DunC with any information for
inclusion in the DunC Proxy Statement which is required by Law or which is
reasonably requested by DunC.  DunC shall consult with Blackhawk with respect to
the DunC Proxy Statement and shall afford Blackhawk reasonable opportunity to
comment thereon.  If, at any time prior to the DunC Meeting, any event should
occur relating to DunC which should be set forth in an amendment of, or a
supplement to, the DunC Proxy Statement, DunC will promptly inform Blackhawk.
In each such case, DunC, with the cooperation of Blackhawk, will promptly
prepare and mail such amendment or supplement and DunC shall consult with
Blackhawk with respect to such supplement or amendment and shall afford
Blackhawk reasonable opportunity to comment thereon prior to such mailing.  DunC
shall notify Blackhawk at least 48 hours prior to the mailing of the DunC Proxy
Statement, or any amendment or supplement thereto, to the DunC Shareholders.

          (c)  The DunC Proxy Statement shall include the recommendation of the
Board of Directors of DunC in favor of the Merger; provided, however, that if
the Board of Directors of DunC shall, in good faith and after consulting with
legal counsel, determine that to make such a recommendation would be a violation
of its fiduciary obligations under applicable Law, then the Board of Directors
of DunC shall not be obligated to make any such recommendation.  In addition,
Blackhawk and DunC shall notify the Paying Agent of the Merger Per Share
Consideration.

 2.11  Payment of Merger Total Consideration.  At the Closing and prior to
       --------------------------------------
the Effective Time, Blackhawk shall deliver to the Paying Agent, by a single
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account in the United States
of America designated by the Paying Agent, an amount (such amount hereinafter
referred to as the "Payment Fund") equal to the Merger Total Consideration.  In
addition, Blackhawk and DunC shall notify the Paying Agent of the Merger Per
Share Consideration.

 2.12  Surrender of Certificates.
       --------------------------

          (a)  Promptly after the Effective Time but no later than three (3)
business days after the Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall deliver to each
DunC Shareholder a form of letter of transmittal and instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of Merger Stock certificates for payment.  Upon
surrender to the Paying Agent of such certificates, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly executed, the Paying Agent shall promptly pay to the DunC
Shareholder entitled thereto, in cash, the Merger Per Share Consideration
multiplied by the number of shares of Merger Stock covered by such surrendered
certificates and transmittal letters.

          (b)  Until surrendered, each outstanding certificate, which prior to
the Effective Time represented shares of Merger Stock, shall be deemed to
represent and evidence only the right to receive the consideration to be paid
therefor as set forth in Section 2.7 of this Agreement and until such surrender,
no cash shall be paid to the holder of such outstanding certificate in respect
thereof.

          (c)  If payment of cash is to be made to a Person other than the
Person in whose name the certificate surrendered is registered, it shall be a
condition to such payment that the certificate so surrendered shall be properly
endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer, and that the Person
requesting such payment shall (i) pay to the Paying Agent any transfer or other
taxes required by reason of payment to a person other than the registered holder
of the certificates surrendered, (ii) authorize the Paying Agent to deduct any
such taxes from such payment, or (iii) establish to the satisfaction of the
Paying Agent that such tax has been paid or is not applicable.

          (d)  No interest shall accrue or be payable with respect to any
amounts which any holder of shares of Merger Stock shall be entitled to receive
pursuant to this Agreement.  The Paying Agent shall be authorized to pay the
Merger Per Share Consideration attributable to any certificate representing
shares of Merger Stock which has been lost or destroyed upon receipt of evidence
of ownership of the shares of Merger Stock represented thereby and of
appropriate indemnification, in each case reasonably satisfactory to Blackhawk.

          (e)  After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the
stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Merger Stock
which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.  If, after the
Effective Time, certificates representing such shares are presented to the
Surviving Corporation, they shall be canceled and exchanged for cash as provided
in this Section 2.12 of this Agreement.

          (f)  Any portion of the Payment Fund which remains undistributed to
the shareholders of the Company six (6) months after the Effective Time shall be
returned, at Blackhawk's request, by the Paying Agent to Blackhawk, which
thereafter shall act as paying agent subject to the rights of holders of
unsurrendered certificates of Merger Stock under this Article II and subject to
applicable Law.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Blackhawk, the Paying
Agent, nor any other party hereto shall be responsible or liable to any holder
of Merger Stock for any cash delivered to any public official pursuant to any
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

          (g)  Blackhawk shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of
Merger Stock such amounts as Blackhawk is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of state,
local or foreign tax Law.  To the extent that amounts are so withheld by
Blackhawk, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Merger Stock in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made by Blackhawk.

          (h)  The Paying Agent shall pay to each DunC Shareholders an amount
equal to the Additional Capital Amount times a fraction, the numerator of which
is the number of shares of Merger Stock owned by such DunC Shareholder and the
denominator of which is the number of shares of Merger Stock.  Such amount shall
be payable:  (i) to DunC Shareholders who have surrendered their DunC stock
certificates prior to receipt by the Paying Agent of the Additional Capital
Amount, as soon as practicable after receipt thereof and (ii) to DunC
Shareholders who have not surrendered their DunC stock certificates prior to
receipt by the Paying Agent of the Additional Capital Amount, at the time of the
payment set forth in subsection (a) above.

 2.13  Subsequent Restructuring.  Concurrent with the Merger or promptly
       -------------------------
following the Effective Time, Blackhawk plans to consolidate DunC and the Bank
with and into Blackhawk and BSB, respectively.  Presently it is anticipated that
the Restructuring will be completed by liquidating DunC and distributing its
assets, after paying off or providing for all of its liabilities, to Blackhawk
as DunC's sole shareholder.  Alternatively, DunC may be merged into Blackhawk
pursuant to applicable Law.  Concurrent with or promptly following such
liquidation or merger, the Bank will be merged with and into BSB pursuant to the
provisions of applicable Law.  The Restructuring is subject to certain
regulatory approvals.  In the event the Restructuring is effected, Blackhawk
agrees that it will assume and timely discharge any and all obligations,
covenants and agreements of DunC under this Agreement which are to be performed
or discharged after the Effective Time, but which have not been fully performed
or discharged as of the time the Restructuring is effected.  Blackhawk agrees,
however, that it will not alter the structure of the Restructuring as described
herein if it would:  (i) alter, change or reduce the amount of the consideration
to be paid to holders of DunC Common Stock or the manner or basis upon which
such exchange is made; (ii) have an adverse federal or state income tax
consequence to DunC, or any of the DunC Shareholders; (iii) have an adverse
effect on the DunC Shareholders; or (iv) would be likely to delay or jeopardize
receipt of the Regulatory Approvals or satisfaction of any of the conditions to
the Merger set forth in Article VII.

 2.14  Anti-Dilution Provisions.  In the event that between the date of this

nor agree to commit to take any action, which would or reasonably can be
expected to:  (i) adversely affect the ability of either Blackhawk or DunC to

 3.10  Employee Benefit Matters.
       -------------------------

          (a)  DunC Profit Sharing Plan.  At or prior to the Effective Time,
               ------------------------
participation in the DunC Profit Sharing Plan shall be discontinued and no
additional participants shall be permitted in such Plan at or after such time.
Blackhawk shall as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time
terminate the DunC Profit Sharing Plan and apply for a letter of determination
from the IRS confirming that the termination of the DunC Profit Sharing Plan

determination letter, all assets held in the DunC Profit Sharing Plan shall be
distributed to participants or transferred on behalf of the participants to
Blackhawk's tax-qualified retirement plans in accordance with the terms of such
plans and ERISA.

          (b)  Health and Welfare Benefits.  Prior to the Closing Date, DunC
               ---------------------------
shall cause to be taken all actions necessary to terminate and discontinue, as
of the Effective Time, all of DunC's and the Bank's health and welfare benefit
plans, programs, insurance and policies, except as necessary to continue paying
benefits to eligible participants receiving benefits as of the Effective Time
and except as necessary to provide COBRA benefits to any employees of the Bank
who may be entitled to receive such benefits as a result of discontinuance of
their employment with the Bank, if any.

          (c)  Sick Leave and Vacation Pay.  Effective as of the Effective Time,
               ---------------------------
employees retained in the employment of the Bank will receive sick days and
vacation days in accordance with Blackhawk's standard policies.  However, for
purposes of determining the amount of vacation time such employees will be
entitled to receive under Blackhawk's vacation policy, such employees will
receive credit for their years of credit service with the Bank prior to the
Effective Time.  For purposes of determining the amount of sick days such
employees will be entitled to receive under Blackhawk's sick days policy,
employees will receive credit for their years of credit service prior to the
Effective Time.

          (d)  Participation in Qualified Blackhawk Employee Benefit Plans.  All
               -----------------------------------------------------------
employees retained in the employment of the Bank following the Effective Time
shall be eligible to participate in any and all qualified pension and retirement
plans and other qualified Employee Benefit Plans sponsored from time to time by
Blackhawk for the benefit of its employees.  Such employees shall be credited
for eligibility and vesting purposes, but not for benefit purposes, for the
years of credit service they accumulated during their employment with the Bank
prior to the Effective Time.  In addition, Blackhawk shall exercise all
reasonable efforts to enable employees retained by the Bank following the
Effective Time to reinvest in Blackhawk's 401(k) Savings Plan the proceeds
received by them in connection with the distributions from the DunC Profit
Sharing Plan described in Section 3.10(a) of this Agreement.

 3.11  Confidentiality.  Blackhawk agrees to treat as strictly confidential
       ----------------
and agrees not to divulge to any other Person (other than its employees,
attorneys, accountants, financial advisors and other agents and representatives
who have a need to know such information for purposes of assisting Blackhawk in
fulfilling its obligations under this Agreement) any financial statements,
schedules, contracts, agreements, instruments, papers, documents and other
information relating to DunC or a DunC Subsidiary which it may come to know or
which may come into its possession pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise
during the course of conducting its investigations contemplated by this
Agreement and, if the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are not
consummated for any reason, Blackhawk agrees promptly to return to DunC all
materials furnished to Blackhawk by or at the direction of DunC.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, information shall not be deemed confidential, and
Blackhawk shall have no duty of confidentiality with respect to information
which:  (a) is known to Blackhawk at the time it is disclosed by or at the
direction of DunC; (b) is disclosed to Blackhawk by a third party not known by
Blackhawk to have an independent duty of confidentiality to DunC with respect
thereto; (c) is in the public domain at the time it is provided to Blackhawk by
or at the direction of DunC, or thereafter falls into the public domain
otherwise than as a result of a breach by Blackhawk of its obligation of
confidentiality under this Section 3.11 of this Agreement.  In the event
Blackhawk is required or finds it necessary to disclose any of the confidential
information in connection with any of the Regulatory Approvals, Blackhawk will
notify DunC of that fact and will cooperate with DunC so as to minimize the
amount of confidential information to be so disclosed and to take such
reasonable precautions to maintain the confidentiality of such information as
may be requested by DunC, including requests to the regulatory authorities that
such information be deemed confidential and not subject to disclosure under the
Freedom of Information Act.  In the event Blackhawk otherwise is required to
disclose any such confidential information, Blackhawk agrees that it will
provide DunC with prompt notice of such required disclosures so that DunC may
seek an appropriate protective order and/or waive Blackhawk's compliance with
the provisions of this Section 3.11 of this Agreement.  Blackhawk's obligations
under this Section 3.11 shall terminate at the Effective Time.

 3.12  Conformance to Loan Policies and Reserve Policies.
       --------------------------------------------------

     (a)  DunC shall cause the Bank to adopt, by April 15, 2003, loan policies
which conform the Bank's loan policies to those of BSB which have been or are
subsequently communicated to DunC.

     (b)  DunC shall cause the Bank to establish such additional accruals and
reserves as may be necessary, in the reasonable judgment of Blackhawk, to
conform the Bank's general valuation allowances to Blackhawk's asset
classification policy, as well as to reflect the costs and expenses of DunC with
respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
provided, however, that DunC shall not be required to cause the Bank to take any
such action until the Regulatory Approvals have been received and DunC is
reasonably satisfied that the Merger will be consummated.

     (c)  DunC's representations, warranties and covenants contained in this
Agreement shall not be deemed to be untrue or breached in any respect for any
purpose as a consequence of any modification or changes undertaken by the Bank
in order for DunC to comply with the requirements of this Section 3.12 of this
Agreement.

 3.13  Conduct of Blackhawk's Business.  Blackhawk will maintain its corporate
       --------------------------------
existence in good standing and conduct its business so as to be able to
consummate the transactions contemplated by the Agreement.  Blackhawk shall, in
the event it becomes aware of the impending or threatened occurrence of any
event or condition which would cause or constitute a breach (or would have
caused or constituted a breach had such event occurred or been known prior to
the date hereof) of any of its representations, covenants or agreements
contained or referred to herein, give prompt written notice thereof to DunC and
use its best efforts to prevent or promptly remedy the same.

 3.14  Break-Up Fee.  In consideration of the substantial expenditure of
       -------------
time, effort and expense incurred and to be incurred by Blackhawk in connection
with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, in the event
this Agreement is terminated for any reason, DunC shall pay promptly to
Blackhawk Seven Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($750,000) in the event that
within twelve (12) months following such termination, DunC or an Affiliate
thereof enters into an agreement providing for or closes an Acquisition.

       -------------------------------------------------------------

     (a)  DunC shall provide Blackhawk with notice of any meeting of the Board
of Directors (or a committee thereof) of DunC or a DunC Subsidiary or of their
shareholders when such notices are sent to the Directors, committee members or
shareholders, as the case may be, and shall permit representatives of Blackhawk
to attend such meetings; provided that representatives of Blackhawk shall not be
permitted to attend any portion of any meeting at which matters relating to
DunC's evaluation of the Merger or the obligations of the parties under this
Agreement are being discussed.

     (b)  DunC shall also provide Blackhawk with a copy of all reports,
documents, and other materials delivered to, prepared for or prepared at the
request of, the Board of Directors (or to any committee thereof) of DunC or a
DunC Subsidiary  or to their shareholders, as the case may be, when such
reports, documents or other materials are delivered to the Directors, committee
members or shareholders; provided that DunC shall not be obligated to deliver to
Blackhawk any report, document or other material relating to the evaluation of
the Merger or the obligations of the parties under this Agreement.

     (c)  DunC shall cause the Bank to provide Blackhawk with notice at least
two (2) business days prior to the Bank making any new loan or renewing any
existing loan in excess of $100,000.  Such notice shall include the material
terms of such loan and the relevant financial statements, cash flow statements,
appraisals or other information in the possession of the Bank which are relevant
to the decision whether to extend credit to the applicable debtor.  The Bank may
make such loan unless, within such two (2) day period, Blackhawk notifies the
Bank that, in its reasonable determination, the Bank should not make such loan.

 3.16     Tail Insurance.  Blackhawk shall obtain a Directors and Officers tail
          --------------
 insurance policy covering the directors and officers of DunC and the Bank for

 policy which DunC and First Bank currently have in place; provided, that
 Blackhawk shall not be required to pay in excess of $10,000 for such tail
 insurance policy.

referred to in this Agreement and required to be delivered pursuant to this
Agreement constitute the entire agreement among the parties pertaining to the

oral or written, and there are no warranties, representations or other
agreements between the parties in connection with the subject matter of this
Agreement, except as specifically set forth in this Agreement.  This Agreement
may be amended by the parties at any time before or after approval of this

supplement, modification, waiver or termination of this Agreement shall be
binding unless executed in writing by the party to be bound thereby.  No waiver

waiver of any other provision of this Agreement, whether or not similar, nor
shall such waiver constitute a continuing waiver unless otherwise expressly
provided.

Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by

connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event Blackhawk terminates this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.1(b) on account of DunC having failed to fulfill or comply
with one or more of the conditions set forth in Section 7.2(a) or 7.2(c) of this
Agreement, or if DunC terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(c)
hereof on account of Blackhawk having failed to fulfill or comply with one or
more of the conditions set forth in Section 7.3(a) or 7.3(c) of this Agreement,
then, in addition to any other rights or remedies such party (the "non-breaching
party") shall have against the other party (the "breaching party") under this

to recover from the breaching party all reasonable and necessary expenses
