                                AMENDMENT ONE TO
                        FLEETBOSTON FINANCIAL CORPORATION

                            JULY 1, 2000 RESTATEMENT

         This Amendment One is effective December 31, 2002.

1.       Section 4.3(b) of the Plan is amended to read in its entirety as
follows:

                  b.       A Participant's eligibility to authorize a payroll
deduction with respect to the Plan shall be suspended if the Participant (i) is
temporarily unable to purchase Shares by reason of the securities laws, or (ii)
takes a hardship withdrawal from the FleetBoston Financial Savings Plan
("Savings Plan") or a predecessor plan. If a Participant's participation in the
ESPP is suspended as a result of a hardship withdrawal made after December 31,
2002, the suspension shall end as of the first pay period beginning six months
after the date of the hardship withdrawal, or as otherwise required by the
Internal Revenue Service. For hardship distributions only, a Participant must
re-enroll after the suspension period if he or she wishes to resume payroll
deductions. The Plan Administrator shall establish reasonable procedures for
administering suspensions.

2.       Section 5.3 of the Plan is amended to read in its entirety as follows:

         5.3      AMOUNT OF DISCOUNTS. Effective February 1, 2003, a Participant
shall receive a 5 percent discount on the purchase of Shares under the Plan, by
means of a contribution to the Plan by the Corporation of 5 cents for each 95
cents contributed by the Participant by payroll deduction. The Committee in its
sole discretion may change or discontinue the discount at any time, provided
that the discount available under the Plan may not exceed 15 percent.

3.       Section 12.1 of the Plan is amended by adding a new first sentence that
reads as follows:

         Subject to adjustment in accordance with the provisions of Section
12.2, the total number of Shares that may be allocated to Participants' Accounts
on or after October 9, 2002 (exclusive of Shares allocated to Participants'
Accounts pursuant to Section 7.2(b)) shall not exceed 4,000,000 shares.
