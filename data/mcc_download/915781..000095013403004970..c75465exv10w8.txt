                      2003 PERFORMANCE PROFIT SHARING PLAN


All employees of the Company are eligible to receive cash profit sharing based
on the 2003 year-end results of the RTW, Inc. and its Subsidiary. The annual
profit sharing plan is based on exceeding the Company's pre-tax, pre-profit
sharing profit plan for 2003. Forty percent (40%) of any excess profit over the
plan, up to a maximum level, will be shared with all employees. The profit
sharing will be distributed as a percentage (%) of salary to all employees. Cash
profit sharing payments are made annually after completion of the year-end
audit.

Executive officers and management personnel, additionally, earn stock options
based upon exceeding the company's pre-tax, pre-profit sharing profit plan for
2003. Executives and management personnel are eligible for a fixed number of
options, pro-rated on a sliding scale, in excess of the profit plan, up to a
maximum level. Stock option grants will be made annually after completion of the
year-end audit.
