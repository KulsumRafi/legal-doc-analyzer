available to Initial Purchaser in reliance upon such assumption. The Initial
Purchaser hereby sells and assigns to the Funding Agent for the ratable benefit
of the APA Banks, and the Funding Agent hereby purchases and assumes from

the subject of any transfer pursuant to this SECTION 2.6. Upon payment of the
Conduit Transfer Price as provided herein and delivery to the Trustee by the
Funding Agent of Initial Purchaser's VFC Certificate, (i) the Company shall
sign, on behalf of the Trust, and shall direct the Trustee in writing to duly
authenticate, and the Trustee, upon receiving such direction, shall so
authenticate, a new VFC Certificate in the name of each APA Bank and in a
denomination equal to such APA Bank's Pro Rata Share as set forth in such
written direction and shall deliver such VFC Certificate to each such APA Bank
in accordance with such written direction and (ii) to the extent Initial
Purchaser's assignment pursuant to this Section 2.6 was for less than 100% of
its Series 2003-1 Purchaser Invested Amount, the Company shall sign, on behalf
of the Trust, and shall direct the Trustee in writing to duly authenticate, and
the Trustee, upon receiving such direction, shall so authenticate, a new VFC
Certificate in the name of Initial Purchaser and in a denomination equal to the
amount of Initial Purchaser's Series 2003-1 Purchaser Invested Amount retained
as set forth in such written direction and shall deliver such VFC Certificate to
Initial Purchaser in accordance with such written direction.

               (b)  TRANSFER PRICE REDUCTION YIELD. If the Adjusted Funded
Amount is included in the calculation of the Conduit Transfer Price for any
Purchase, each APA Bank agrees that the Funding Agent shall pay to Initial
Purchaser the Conduit Reduction Percentage of any Monthly Interest Payment
received by the Funding Agent with respect to the interest assigned in such
Purchase.

               (c)  PAYMENTS TO INITIAL PURCHASER. In consideration for the
reduction of the Conduit Transfer Prices by the Conduit Transfer Price
Reductions, effective only at such time as the aggregate amount of the Series
2003-1 Purchaser Invested Amounts of the APA Banks equals the Conduit Residual,
each APA Bank hereby agrees that the Funding Agent shall not distribute to the
APA Banks and shall immediately remit to Initial Purchaser any Monthly Interest
Payments, Collections or other payments received by it to be applied pursuant to
the terms hereof or otherwise to reduce the Series 2003-1 Purchaser Invested
Amounts of the APA Banks.

               (d)  LIMITATION ON COMMITMENT TO PURCHASE FROM INITIAL PURCHASER.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Supplement, no APA Bank shall
have any obligation to purchase any interest in the Conduit Interest from
Initial Purchaser, pursuant to SECTION 2.6(a) or otherwise, if:

                    Initial Purchaser shall have voluntarily commenced any
     proceeding or filed any petition under any bankruptcy, insolvency or
     similar law seeking the dissolution, liquidation or reorganization of
     Initial Purchaser or taken any corporate action for the purpose of
     effectuating any of the foregoing; or

                    involuntary proceedings or an involuntary petition shall
     have been commenced or filed against Initial Purchaser by any Person under
     any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law seeking the dissolution,
     liquidation or reorganization of Initial Purchaser and such proceeding or
     petition shall have not been dismissed.

               (e)  DEFAULTING APA BANKS. If one or more APA Banks defaults in
its obligation to pay its Acquisition Amount pursuant to SECTION 2.5(b) or
SECTION 2.6(a) (each such APA Bank shall be called a "DEFAULTING APA BANK" and
the aggregate amount of such defaulted obligations pursuant to Section 2.5(b)
being herein called the "FUNDING DEFICIT" and the aggregate amount of such
defaulted obligations pursuant to Section 2.6(a) being herein called the
"CONDUIT TRANSFER PRICE DEFICIT"), then upon notice from the Funding Agent, each
APA Bank other

                                       31
<Page>

than the Defaulting APA Banks (a "NON-DEFAULTING APA BANK") shall promptly pay
to the Funding Agent, in immediately available funds, an amount equal to the
lesser of (x) such Non-Defaulting APA Bank's proportionate share (based upon the
relative Commitments of the Non-Defaulting APA Banks) of the Funding Deficit or
the Conduit Transfer Price Deficit (as applicable) and (y) the unused portion of
such Non-Defaulting APA Bank's Commitment. A Defaulting APA Bank shall forthwith
upon demand pay to the Funding Agent for the account of the Non-Defaulting APA
Banks all amounts paid by each Non-Defaulting APA Bank on behalf of such
Defaulting APA Bank, together with interest thereon, for each day from the date
a payment was made by a Non-Defaulting APA Bank until the date such
Non-Defaulting APA Bank has been paid such amounts in full, at a rate per annum
equal to the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus two percent (2%). In addition,
without prejudice to any other rights that Initial Purchaser may have under
applicable law, each Defaulting APA Bank shall pay to Initial Purchaser
forthwith upon demand, the difference between such Defaulting APA Bank's unpaid
Acquisition Amount and the amount paid with respect thereto by the
Non-Defaulting APA Banks, together with interest thereon, for each day from the
date of the Funding Agent's request for such Defaulting APA Bank's Acquisition
Amount pursuant to SUBSECTION 2.6(a) until the date the requisite amount is paid
to Initial Purchaser in full, at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds
Effective Rate plus two percent (2%).

               (f)  TERMINATING APA BANKS.

                    Each APA Bank hereby agrees to deliver written notice to the
     Funding Agent not more than 30 Business Days and not less than 5 Business
     Days prior to the Commitment Expiry Date indicating whether such APA Bank
     intends to renew its Commitment hereunder. If any APA Bank fails to deliver
     such notice on or prior to the date that is 5 Business Days prior to the
     Commitment Expiry Date, such APA Bank will be deemed to have declined to
     renew its Commitment (each APA Bank which has declined or has been deemed
     to have declined to renew its Commitment hereunder, a "NON-RENEWING APA
     BANK"). The Funding Agent shall promptly notify Initial Purchaser of each
     Non-Renewing APA Bank and Initial Purchaser, in its sole discretion, may
     (A) to the extent of Commitment Availability, declare that such
     Non-Renewing APA Bank's Commitment shall, to such extent, automatically
     terminate on a date specified by Initial Purchaser on or before the
     Commitment Expiry Date or (B) upon one (1) Business Days' notice to such
     Non-Renewing APA Bank assign to such Non-Renewing APA Bank on a date
     specified by Initial Purchaser its Pro

                                       32
<Page>

     Rata Share of the outstanding Conduit Interest, subject to, and in
     accordance with, SUBSECTION 2.6(a). In addition, Initial Purchaser may, in
     its sole discretion, at any time (x) to the extent of Commitment
     Availability, declare that any Affected APA Bank's Commitment shall
     automatically terminate on a date specified by Initial Purchaser or (y)
     assign to any Affected APA Bank on a date specified by Initial Purchaser
     its Pro Rata Share of the outstanding Conduit Interest, subject to, and in
     accordance with, SUBSECTION 2.6(a) (each Affected APA Bank or each
     Non-Renewing APA Bank is hereinafter referred to as a "TERMINATING APA
     BANK"). The parties hereto expressly acknowledge that any declaration of
     the termination of any Commitment, any assignment pursuant to this
     subsection (f) and the order of priority of any such termination or
     assignment among Terminating APA Banks shall be made by Initial Purchaser
     in its sole and absolute discretion.

                    Upon any assignment to a Terminating APA Bank as provided in
     this subsection (f), any remaining Commitment of such Terminating APA Bank
     shall automatically terminate. Upon reduction to zero of such Terminating
     APA Bank's Series 2003-1 Purchaser Invested Amount (after application of
     Collections thereto pursuant to Article III) all rights and obligations of
     such Terminating APA Bank hereunder shall be terminated and such
     Terminating APA Bank shall no longer be an "APA BANK" hereunder; provided,
     however, that the provisions of Section 2.9 and Article VII shall continue
     in effect for its benefit with respect to the portion of the VFC
     Certificateholders' Interest held by such Terminating APA Bank prior to its
     termination as a APA Bank.

          SECTION 2.7    PROCEDURE FOR DECREASING THE SERIES 2003-1 INVESTED
AMOUNT; OPTIONAL TERMINATION. (a) On any Business Day during the Series 2003-1
Revolving Period or the Series 2003-1 Amortization Period, upon the written
request of the Servicer or the Company on behalf of the Trust to the Funding
Agent substantially in the form of Exhibit E-2 hereto, the Series 2003-1
Invested Amount may be reduced (a "DECREASE") by the distribution by the
Servicer to the Funding Agent for the PRO RATA benefit of the Purchasers in
accordance with their respective Series 2003-1 Purchaser Invested Amount of
funds on deposit in the Series 2003-1 Collection Subaccount on such day in an
amount not to exceed the amount of such funds on deposit on such day; PROVIDED
that the Servicer shall have given the Funding Agent (with a copy to the
Trustee) irrevocable written notice (effective upon receipt), prior to 1:00
p.m., Chicago time in accordance with the Required

                                       33
<Page>

Notice Period, and which notice shall state the amount of such Decrease;
PROVIDED, FURTHER, that such Decrease shall be in an amount equal to $1,000,000
and integral multiples of $100,000 in excess thereof.

               (b)  Simultaneously with any such Decrease during the Series
2003-1 Revolving Period, the Series 2003-1 Subordinated Interest Amount shall be
reduced by an amount (the "SERIES 2003-1 SUBORDINATED INTEREST REDUCTION
AMOUNT") such that the Series 2003-1 Subordinated Interest Amount shall equal
the Series 2003-1 Required Reserves after giving effect to such Decrease. During
the Series 2003-1 Revolving Period, after the distribution described in Section
(a) above has been made, and the Series 2003-1 Subordinated Interest Amount
shall have been reduced by the Series 2003-1 Subordinated Interest Reduction
Amount, a distribution shall be made to the owner of the Series 2003-1
Subordinated Interest out of remaining funds on deposit in the Series 2003-1
Collection Subaccount in an amount equal to the lesser of (x) the Series 2003-1
Subordinated Interest Reduction Amount and (y) the amount of such remaining
funds on deposit in the Series 2003-1 Collection Subaccount.

               (c)  Any reduction in the Series 2003-1 Invested Amount held by
the APA Banks on any Business Day shall be allocated first to reduce the
Unallocated Balance and then to reduce the portion of the Series 2003-1 Invested
Amount allocated to Eurodollar Tranches in such order as the Company may select
in order to minimize costs payable pursuant to SECTION 7.4.

               (d)  (i) On any Business Day unless the Scheduled Revolving
Termination Date, or an Early Amortization Event shall have occurred and be
continuing, the Company shall have the right to deliver an irrevocable written
notice (an "OPTIONAL TERMINATION NOTICE") to the Trustee, Funding Agent and the
Servicer in which the Company declares that the Series 2003-1 Revolving Period
shall terminate on the date (the "OPTIONAL TERMINATION DATE") set forth in such
notice (which date, in any event, shall be the last day of a Accrual Period
which is not less than 10 Business Days from the date on which such notice is
delivered).

                    From and after the Optional Termination Date, the Series
     2003-1 Amortization Period shall commence for all purposes under this
     Supplement and the other Transaction Documents. The Trustee shall give
     prompt written notice of its receipt of an Optional Termination Notice to
     the Purchasers.

          SECTION 2.8    REDUCTIONS OF THE COMMITMENTS. (a) On any Business Day
during the Series 2003-1 Revolving Period, the Company, on behalf of

                                       34
<Page>

the Trust, may, upon ten Business Days' prior written notice to the Funding
Agent (with copies to the Servicer and the Trustee) reduce or terminate the
Commitments (a "COMMITMENT REDUCTION") in a minimum aggregate amount equal to
$5,000,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof; PROVIDED that no
such termination or reduction shall be permitted if, after giving effect thereto
and to any reduction in the Series 2003-1 Invested Amount on such date, the
Series 2003-1 Invested Amount would exceed the Maximum Invested Amount then in
effect. Each APA Bank's Commitment shall be reduced by such APA Bank's Pro Rata
Share of the amount of such Commitment Reduction.

               (b)  Upon commencement of the Series 2003-1 Amortization Period,
the Aggregate Commitment Amount shall be reduced to 102% of the Maximum Invested
Amount, and the Maximum Invested Amount shall be reduced to the Series 2003-1
Invested Amount. Each APA Bank's commitment shall be reduced by such APA Bank's
Pro Rata Share of the amount of such reduction.

               (c)  Once reduced, the Commitments may not be subsequently
reinstated. Upon effectiveness of any such reduction, the Funding Agent shall
prepare a revised Schedule 1 to reflect the reduced Commitment of each APA Bank
and Schedule 1 of this Supplement shall be deemed to be automatically superseded
by such revised Schedule 1. The Funding Agent shall distribute such revised
Schedule 1 to the Company, the Servicer, the Trustee and each APA Bank.

          SECTION 2.9    INTEREST, FEES. (a) Interest shall be payable on the
VFC Certificates on each Distribution Date pursuant to Section 3A.6(a).

               (b)  The Servicer shall distribute pursuant to Section 3A.6(b),
from amounts on deposit in the Series 2003-1 Collection Subaccount, to the
Funding Agent, for the PRO RATA account of the APA Banks in accordance with
their respective Pro Rata Shares, on each Distribution Date, a commitment fee
with respect to the Accrual Period ending immediately prior to such date (the
"COMMITMENT FEE") equal to the Commitment Fee Rate multiplied by the average
daily Aggregate Commitment Amount during such Accrual Period. The Commitment Fee
shall be payable (i) monthly in arrears on each Distribution Date (including
during the Series 2003-1 Amortization Period) and (ii) on the Commitment
Termination Date. To the extent that funds on deposit in the Series 2003-1
Collection Subaccount at any such date are insufficient to pay the Commitment
Fee due on such date, the Servicer shall so notify the Company and the Company
shall immediately pay the Funding Agent the amount of any such deficiency.

                                       35
<Page>

               (c)  The Servicer shall distribute pursuant to SECTION 3A.6(b),
from amounts on deposit in the Series 2003-1 Collection Subaccount, to the
Funding Agent, for the account of Initial Purchaser, on each Distribution Date
with respect to which Initial Purchaser held a portion of the Series 2003-1
Invested Amount during the Accrual Period ending immediately prior to such date,
a utilization fee (the "UTILIZATION FEE") with respect to such Accrual Period at
the Utilization Fee Rate of the average Series 2003-1 Invested Amount during
such period. The Utilization Fee shall be payable monthly in arrears on each
Distribution Date. To the extent that funds on deposit in the Series 2003-1
Collection Subaccount at any such date are insufficient to pay the Utilization
Fee due on such date, the Servicer shall so notify the Company and the Company
shall immediately pay the Funding Agent the amount of any such deficiency.

               (d)  Calculations of per annum rates and fees under this
Supplement shall be made on the basis of a 360- (or 365-/366-, in the case of
interest on the Floating Tranche based on the Prime Rate) day year with respect
to Commitment Fees, Utilization Fees and interest rates. Each determination of
the Adjusted LIBO Rate by the Funding Agent shall be conclusive and binding upon
each of the parties hereto in the absence of manifest error.

          SECTION 2.10   INDEMNIFICATION BY THE COMPANY AND THE SERVICER.
Without limiting any other rights that the Funding Agent or any Purchaser may
have hereunder or under applicable law, (A) the Company hereby agrees to
indemnify (and pay upon demand to) the Trustee, the Funding Agent and each
Purchaser and their respective assigns, officers, directors, agents and
employees (each an "INDEMNIFIED PARTY") from and against any and all damages,
losses, claims, taxes, liabilities, costs, expenses and for all other amounts
payable, including reasonable attorneys' fees (which attorneys may be employees
of the Indemnified Party, provided that such fees of attorneys that are
employees of any Indemnified Party shall not be duplicative of the fees of any
third-party attorneys retained by such Indemnified Party) and disbursements (all
of the foregoing being collectively referred to as "INDEMNIFIED AMOUNTS")
awarded against or incurred by any of them arising out of or as a result of any
Pooling and Servicing Agreement or any other Transaction Document or the
acquisition, either directly or indirectly, by a Purchaser of an interest in the
Trust or Trust Assets, and (B) the Servicer hereby agrees to indemnify (and pay
upon demand to) each Indemnified Party for Indemnified Amounts awarded against
or incurred by any of them arising out of the Servicer's activities as Servicer
hereunder excluding, however, in all of the foregoing instances under the
preceding clauses (A) and (B):

               (i)     Indemnified Amounts to the extent a final judgment of

                                       36
<Page>

a court of competent jurisdiction holds that such Indemnified Amounts resulted
from gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Indemnified Party
seeking indemnification;

               (ii)    Indemnified Amounts to the extent the same includes
losses in respect of Receivables that are uncollectible on account of the
insolvency, bankruptcy or lack of creditworthiness of the related Obligor; or

               (iii)   Excluded Taxes to the extent that the computation of such
taxes is consistent with the intended characterization for income tax purposes
of the acquisition by the Purchasers of the VFC Certificates (or any interest
therein) as a loan or loans by the Purchasers to the Company secured by the
Receivables, and other Trust Assets;

PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that nothing contained in this sentence shall limit the
liability of the Company or the Servicer or limit the recourse of the Funding
Agent or the Purchasers to the Company or the Servicer for amounts otherwise
specifically provided to be paid by the Company or the Servicer, as applicable,
under the terms of any Pooling and Servicing Agreement. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing indemnification, the Company shall indemnify each
Indemnified Party for Indemnified Amounts (including, without limitation, losses
in respect of uncollectible receivables, regardless of whether reimbursement
therefor would constitute recourse to the Company or the Servicer) relating to
or resulting from:

               (i)     any representation or warranty made by the Company, the
Servicer, the Support Provider or any Seller (or any officers of any such
Person) under or in connection with any Pooling and Servicing Agreement or any
other Transaction Document or any other information or report delivered by any
such Person pursuant hereto or thereto, which shall have been false or incorrect
when made or deemed made;

               (ii)    the failure by the Company, the Servicer, the Support
Provider or any Seller to comply with any applicable law, rule or regulation
with respect to any Receivable or Contract related thereto, or the nonconformity
of any Receivable or Contract included therein with any such applicable law,
rule or regulation or any failure of any Seller to keep or perform any of its
obligations, express or implied, with respect to any Contract;

               (iii)   any failure of the Company, the Servicer, the Support
Provider or any Seller to perform its duties, covenants or other obligations in
accordance with the provisions of any Pooling and Servicing Agreement or any
other

                                       37

Transaction Document;

               (iv)    any products liability, personal injury or damage suit,
or other similar claim arising out of or in connection with merchandise,
insurance or services that are the subject of any Contract or any Receivable;

               (v)     any dispute, claim, offset or defense (other than
discharge in bankruptcy of the Obligor) of the Obligor to the payment of any
Receivable (including, without limitation, a defense based on such Receivable or
the related Contract not being a legal, valid and binding obligation of such
Obligor enforceable against it in accordance with its terms), or any other claim
resulting from the sale of the merchandise or service related to such Receivable
or the furnishing or failure to furnish such merchandise or services;

               (vi)    the commingling of Collections of Receivables at any time
with other funds;

               (vii)   any investigation, litigation or proceeding related to or
arising from any Pooling and Servicing Agreement or any other Transaction
Document, the transactions contemplated hereby, the use of the proceeds of an
Increase, the ownership of the VFC Certificates (or any interest therein) or any
other investigation, litigation or proceeding relating to the Company, the
Servicer, the Support Provider or any Seller in which any Indemnified Party
becomes involved as a result of any of the transactions contemplated hereby;

               (viii)  any inability to litigate any claim against any Obligor
in respect of any Receivable as a result of such Obligor being immune from civil
and commercial law and suit on the grounds of sovereignty or otherwise from any
legal action, suit or proceeding;

               (ix)    any Bankruptcy Event relating to the Company, the
Servicer, the Support Provider, any Seller or any of their respective
Subsidiaries;

               (x)     any failure of the Company to acquire and maintain legal
and equitable title to, and ownership of any Receivable and the Related Property
and Collections with respect thereto from USFS, free and clear of any Lien
(other than as created hereunder); or any failure of the Company to give
reasonably equivalent value to USFS under the USFS Receivables Sale Agreement in
consideration of the transfer by USFS of any Receivable, or any attempt by any
Person to void such transfer under statutory provisions or common law or
equitable action;

                                       38

               (xi)    any failure of USFS to acquire and maintain legal and
equitable title to, and ownership of any Receivable and the Related Property and
Collections with respect thereto from any Seller, free and clear of any Lien

equivalent value to any Seller under the USSC Receivables Sale Agreement in
consideration of the transfer by such Seller of any Receivable, or any attempt
by any Person to void such transfer under statutory provisions or common law or
equitable action;

               (xii)   any failure to vest and maintain vested in the Trustee
for the benefit of the Trust and the Purchasers, or to transfer to the Trustee
for the benefit of the Trust and the Purchasers, legal and equitable title to,
and ownership of, a first priority perfected undivided percentage ownership
interest (to the extent of the Invested Percentage contemplated hereunder) or
security interest in the Receivables, the Related Property and the Collections,
free and clear of any Lien (except as created by the Transaction Documents);

               (xiii)  the failure to have filed, or any delay in filing,
financing statements or other similar instruments or documents under the UCC of
any applicable jurisdiction or other applicable laws with respect to any
Receivable, the Related Property and Collections with respect thereto, and the
proceeds of any thereof, whether at the time of any Increase or at any
subsequent time;

               (xiv)   any action or omission by the Company, the Servicer, the
Support Provider or any Seller which reduces or impairs the rights of the
Trustee or the Purchasers with respect to any Receivable or the value of any
such Receivable;

               (xv)    any attempt by any Person to void any Increase hereunder
or the purchase of any VFC Certificate under statutory provisions or common law
or equitable action; and

               (xvi)   the failure of any Receivable included in the calculation
of the Series 2003-1 Allocated Receivables Amount as an Eligible Receivable to

The foregoing provisions shall survive the termination of this Supplement and
the Agreement, resignation or removal of any Indemnified Party and satisfaction

the Purchasers, of the owner of the Series 2003-1 Subordinated Interest, a
subaccount of the Collection Account (the "SERIES 2003-1 COLLECTION
SUBACCOUNT"), which subaccount is the Series Collection Subaccount with respect
to Series 2003-1 and shall bear a designation indicating that the funds
deposited therein are held for the benefit of the Persons (and, for each such
Person, to the extent) set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) above. The Trustee
shall have the right to take sole dominion and control of the Collection Account

effect to such

                                       40
<Page>

distribution, the Series 2003-1 Target Receivables Amount would not exceed the
Series 2003-1 Allocated Receivables Amount; PROVIDED FURTHER that if the Company
or the Servicer, on behalf of the Company, shall have given the Funding Agent
irrevocable written notice in accordance with SECTION 2.7, the Servicer may
withdraw all or a portion of such amounts on deposit in the Series 2003-1
Collection Subaccount and apply such withdrawn amounts toward the reduction of

                                   ARTICLE VI

                                  SERVICING FEE

          SECTION 6.1    SERVICING COMPENSATION. A periodic servicing fee (the
"SERIES 2003-1 PERIODIC SERVICING FEE") shall be payable to the Servicer on

                                       51
<Page>

each Distribution Date for the preceding Accrual Period in an amount equal to
the product of (a) the Servicing Fee and (b) a fraction the numerator of which
is the daily average Series 2003-1 Invested Amount for such Accrual Period and
the denominator of which is the daily average Aggregate Invested Amounts.

                                   ARTICLE VII

                             CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

          SECTION 7.1    ILLEGALITY. Notwithstanding any other provision herein,
if any APA Bank shall notify the Funding Agent, the Trustee and the Company in
writing that making or maintaining its portion of the VFC Certificateholders'
Interest in any Eurodollar Tranche would violate any applicable law, rule,
regulation, or directive of any Governmental Authority as a result of a Change
in Law, then the portion of each Eurodollar Tranche applicable to such APA Bank
shall thereafter be calculated by reference to the Alternate Base Rate. If any
such change in the method of calculating interest occurs on a day which is not
the last day of the Eurodollar Period with respect to any Eurodollar Tranche,
the Company shall pay to the Funding Agent for the account of such APA Bank the
amounts, if any, as may be required pursuant to SECTION 7.4.

          SECTION 7.2    INCREASED COSTS.

               (a)  If any Change in Law (except with respect to Taxes which
shall be governed by Section 7.3) shall:

                    impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special
     deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the
     account of, or credit extended by, any APA Bank (except any such reserve
     requirement reflected in the Adjusted LIBO Rate); or

                    impose on any Purchaser or the London interbank market any
     other condition in respect of its interest in the VFC Certificates or under
     the Transaction Documents;

and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such
Purchaser of making, converting into, continuing or maintaining its portion of
the VFC Certificateholders' Interest (or maintaining its obligation to do so) or
to reduce any amount received or receivable by such Purchaser hereunder (whether
principal,

                                       52
<Page>

interest or otherwise) or to require any payment calculated by reference to the
amount of interests or loans held or interest received by such Purchaser, then
upon demand by the Funding Agent the Company will pay to such Purchaser such
additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Purchaser for such
additional costs incurred or reduction suffered. For the avoidance of doubt, if
the FASB Interpretation No. 46, or any other change in accounting standards or
the issuance of any other pronouncement, release or interpretation, causes or
requires the consolidation of all or a portion of the assets and liabilities of
Initial Purchaser, the Trust or the Company with the assets and liabilities of
the Funding Agent or any APA Bank, such event shall constitute a circumstance on
which a Purchaser may base a claim for reimbursement under this SECTION 7.2.

               (b)  If any APA Bank determines that any Change in Law regarding
capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return
on such APA Bank's capital or the capital of any corporation controlling such
APA Bank as a consequence of its obligations hereunder to a level below that
which such APA Bank or such corporation could have achieved but for such Change
in Law (taking into consideration such APA Bank's or such corporation's policies
with respect to capital adequacy), then upon demand by the Funding Agent, the
Company shall pay to such APA Bank such additional amount or amounts as will
compensate such APA Bank for any such reduction suffered.

               (c)  A certificate of an APA Bank prepared in good faith and in a
manner generally consistent with such APA Bank's customary practice (if any) and
setting forth in reasonable detail the amount or amounts necessary to compensate
such APA Bank as specified in Sections (a) and (b) of this SECTION 7.2 shall be
delivered to the Company (with a copy to the Funding Agent) and shall be
conclusive absent manifest error. The agreements in this Section shall survive
the termination of this Supplement and the Agreement and the payment of all
amounts payable hereunder and thereunder.

               (d)  Failure or delay on the part of any APA Bank to demand
compensation pursuant to this Section 7.2 shall not constitute a waiver of such
APA Bank's right to demand such compensation; PROVIDED that the Company shall
not be required to compensate an APA Bank pursuant to this Section 7.2 for any
increased costs or reductions incurred more than 270 days prior to the date that
such APA Bank notifies the Company of the Change in Law giving rise to such
increased costs or reductions and of such APA Bank's intention to claim
compensation therefor; PROVIDED FURTHER that, if the Change in Law giving rise
to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 270-day period
referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect
thereof.

                                       53

          SECTION 7.3    TAXES. (a) Any and all payments with respect to the
Purchaser's interests in the VFC Certificates or by or on account of any
obligation of the Company hereunder shall be made free and clear of and without
deduction for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes; PROVIDED that if the Company
shall be required to deduct any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes from such
payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after
making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional
sums payable under this Section 7.3) the Funding Agent or such APA Bank receives
an amount equal to the sum that it would have received had no such deductions
been made, (ii) the Company shall make such deductions and (iii) the Company
shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in
accordance with applicable law.

               (b)  In addition, the Company shall pay any Other Taxes to the
relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

               (c)  Subject to paragraph (e) of this Section 7.3, the Company
shall indemnify the Funding Agent and each APA Bank within the later of 10 days
after written demand therefor and the Distribution Date next following such
demand for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes paid by the
Funding Agent or such APA Bank on or with respect to any payment in respect of
the Purchaser's interests in the VFC Certificates or by or on account of any
obligation of the Company hereunder or under any other Transaction Document
(including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or
attributable to amounts payable under this Section 7.3) and any penalties,
interest and expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not
such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or
asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount
of such payment or liability delivered to the Company by the Funding Agent or an
APA Bank shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The agreements in this
Section shall survive the termination of this Supplement and the Agreement and
the payment of all amounts payable hereunder and thereunder.

               (d)  As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified
Taxes or Other Taxes by the Company to a Governmental Authority, the Company
shall deliver to the Funding Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt
issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the
return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably
satisfactory to the Funding Agent.

                                       54
<Page>

               (e)  The Funding Agent and each APA Bank shall (but with respect
to any Indemnified Tax or Other Tax arising from a Change in Law, only to the
extent the Funding Agent or such APA Bank is legally able to do so) deliver to
the Company (with a copy to the Funding Agent) such properly completed and
executed documentation prescribed by applicable law and reasonably requested by
the Company on the later of (i) 30 Business Days after such request is made and
the applicable forms are provided to such APA Bank or (ii) 30 Business Days
before prescribed by applicable law as will permit such payments to be made
without withholding or with an exemption from or reduction of Indemnified Taxes
or Other Taxes. Failure to timely provide such documentation to the Company
shall relieve the Company of any indemnification responsibility under this
SECTION 7.3 to such APA Bank or the Funding Agent (as applicable), but only to
the extent having provided such documentation would have mitigated such
Indemnified Tax or Other Tax.

               (f)  If the Funding Agent or an APA Bank (or a Transferee)
receives a refund solely in respect of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes, it
shall pay over such refund to the Company to the extent that such Funding Agent
or APA Bank (or Transferee) has already received indemnity payments or
additional amounts pursuant to this Section 7.3 with respect to such Indemnified
Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to the refund, net of all out-of-pocket
expenses and without interest (other than interest paid by the relevant
Governmental Authority with respect to such refund); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the
Company shall, upon request of the Funding Agent or such APA Bank (or
Transferee), repay such refund (plus interest or other charges imposed by the
relevant Governmental Authority) to the Funding Agent or such APA Bank (or
Transferee) if the Funding Agent or such APA Bank (or Transferee) is required to
repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Nothing contained herein shall
require the Funding Agent or an APA Bank (or Transferee) to make its tax returns
(or any other information relating to its taxes which it deems confidential)
available to the Company or any other Person.

          SECTION 7.4    BREAK FUNDING PAYMENTS. The Company agrees to indemnify
each APA Bank and to hold each APA Bank harmless from any loss or expense which
such APA Bank may sustain or incur as a consequence of (a) default by the
Company in making a borrowing of, conversion into or continuation of a
Eurodollar Tranche after the Company has given irrevocable notice requesting the
same in accordance with the provisions of this Supplement, or (b) default by the
Company in making any prepayment in connection with a Decrease after the Company
has given irrevocable notice thereof in accordance with the provisions of
SECTION 2.7, or (c) the making of a prepayment of a Eurodollar Tranche prior to
the termination of the Eurodollar Period for such Eurodollar Tranche. Such

                                       55
<Page>

indemnification may include an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the
amount of interest which would have accrued on the amount not so borrowed,
converted or continued (or, in the case of clause (b), the amount not prepaid)
or the amount so prepaid, for the period from the date of such failure to
borrow, convert, continue or decrease or such prepayment to the last day of the
Eurodollar Period (or in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue,
the Eurodollar Period that would have commenced on the date of such prepayment
or of such failure) in each case at the Adjusted LIBO Rate for such Eurodollar
Tranche provided for herein over (ii) the amount of interest (as reasonably
determined by such APA Bank) which would have accrued to such APA Bank on such
amount by placing such amount on deposit for a comparable period with leading
banks in the interbank eurodollar market. This covenant shall survive the
termination of this Supplement and the Agreement and the payment of all amounts
payable hereunder and thereunder. A certificate as to any additional amounts
payable pursuant to the foregoing sentence, showing in reasonable detail the
calculation thereof, submitted by any APA Bank to the Company shall be
conclusive absent manifest error.

          Notwithstanding anything in this Supplement to the contrary, the
Company agrees to indemnify Initial Purchaser and to hold Initial Purchaser
harmless from any loss or expense which Initial Purchaser may sustain or incur
as a consequence of (a) default by the Company in making a borrowing or
conversion to be funded by Commercial Paper after the Company has given
irrevocable notice requesting the same in accordance with the provisions of this
Supplement, (b) the prepayment without satisfaction of the notice requirements
set forth in SECTION 2.7, whether in connection with a Decrease or otherwise, of
any portion of the Series 2003-1 Invested Amount held by Initial Purchaser or
(c) assignment by Initial Purchaser of its interest in the VFC Certificates
pursuant to SECTION 2.6.

          SECTION 7.5    ALTERNATIVE RATE OF INTEREST. If any APA Bank
determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that:

               (a)  deposits of a type and maturity appropriate to match fund
its Pro Rata Share of any Eurodollar Tranche at the Adjusted LIBO Rate are not
available or adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the
Adjusted LIBO Rate for such Eurodollar Period, or

               (b)  the Adjusted LIBO Rate for such Eurodollar Period will not
adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such APA Bank of making or maintaining
the Eurodollar Tranches during such Eurodollar Period,

then the Funding Agent shall forthwith give telecopy or telephonic notice
thereof to

                                       56
<Page>

the Company, the Trustee and the Purchasers, whereupon until the Funding Agent
notifies the Company and the Trustee that the circumstances giving rise to such
notice no longer exist, the Available Pricing Amount shall not be allocated to
any Eurodollar Tranche and the portion of each Eurodollar Tranche applicable to
such APA Bank shall thereafter be calculated by reference to the Alternate Base
Rate.

          SECTION 7.6    MITIGATION OBLIGATIONS. (a) If any APA Bank requests
compensation under Section 7.2, or if the Company is required to pay any
additional amount to any APA Bank or any Governmental Authority for the account
of any APA Bank pursuant to Section 7.3, then such APA Bank shall use reasonable
efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its
obligations under this Supplement and the Agreement or to assign its rights and
obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in
the judgment of such APA Bank, such designation or assignment (i) would
eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 7.2 or 7.3, as the case
may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such APA Bank to any
unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such
APA Bank. The Company hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses
incurred by any APA Bank in connection with any such designation or assignment.

               (b)  If any APA Bank requests compensation under Section 7.2, or
if the Company is required to pay any additional amount to any APA Bank or any
Governmental Authority for the account of any APA Bank pursuant to Section 7.3,
or if any APA Bank defaults in its obligations under SECTION 2.3, then the
Company may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such APA Bank and
the Funding Agent require such APA Bank to assign and delegate, without recourse
(in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in SECTION 11.11),
all its interests, rights and obligations under this Supplement to an assignee
that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another APA Bank, if
an APA Bank accepts such assignment); PROVIDED that (i) the Company shall have
received the prior written consent of the Funding Agent, which consent shall not
unreasonably be withheld, (ii) such APA Bank shall have received payment of an
amount equal to its Series 2003-1 Purchaser Invested Amount, accrued interest
thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the
assignee (to the extent of such Series 2003-1 Purchaser Invested Amount and
accrued interest and fees) or the Company (in the case of all other amounts) and
(iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation
under Section 7.2 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 7.3, such
assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments. An APA
Bank shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior
thereto, as a result of a waiver by

                                       57
<Page>

such APA Bank or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Company to require
such assignment and delegation cease to apply.

                                THE FUNDING AGENT

          SECTION 10.1   APPOINTMENT. Each Purchaser and APA Bank hereby
irrevocably designates and appoints the Funding Agent as the agent of such
Purchaser and APA Bank, respectively, under this Supplement and each such
Purchaser and APA Bank irrevocably authorizes the Funding Agent, in such
capacity, to take such action on its behalf under the provisions of this
Supplement and to exercise such powers and perform such duties as are expressly
delegated to the Funding Agent by the terms of this Supplement, together with
such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. In its capacity as agent
of each Purchaser and APA Bank, the Funding Agent shall act with the same due
care as it does with

                                       63
<Page>

respect to its own investments. Subject to the foregoing sentence or any
provision to the contrary elsewhere in this Supplement, the Funding Agent shall
not have any duties or responsibilities except those expressly set forth herein,
or any fiduciary relationship with any Purchaser or APA Bank, and no implied
covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall
be read into this Supplement or otherwise exist against the Funding Agent.

          SECTION 10.2   DELEGATION OF DUTIES. The Funding Agent may execute
any of its duties under this Supplement by or through agents or
attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to advice of counsel (who may be counsel
for the Company or the Servicer), independent public accountants and other
experts selected by it concerning all matters pertaining to such duties. The
Funding Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any
agents or attorneys-in-fact selected by it with reasonable care.

          SECTION 10.3   EXCULPATORY PROVISIONS. Neither the Funding Agent nor
any of its officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or
Affiliates shall be (i) liable for any action lawfully taken or omitted to be
taken by it or such Person under or in connection with the Agreement or this
Supplement (x) with the consent or at the request of the Majority Purchasers or
(y) in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct or (ii)
responsible in any manner to any of the Purchasers for any recitals, statements,
representations or warranties made by the Company or any officer thereof
contained in this Supplement or any other Transaction Document or in any
certificate, report, statement or other document referred to or provided for in,
or received by the Funding Agent under or in connection with, this Supplement or
any other Transaction Document or for the value, validity, effectiveness,
genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this Supplement or any other
Transaction Document or for any failure of the Company or the Servicer to
perform its obligations hereunder or thereunder. The Funding Agent shall not be
under any obligation to any Purchaser to ascertain or to inquire as to the
observance or performance of any of the agreements contained in, or conditions
of, this Supplement or any other Transaction Document, or to inspect the
properties, books or records of the Company or the Servicer.

          SECTION 10.4   RELIANCE BY FUNDING AGENT. The Funding Agent shall be
entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any Certificate,
writing, resolution, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, telecopy,
telex or teletype message, statement, order or other document or conversation
believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made
by the proper Person or Persons and upon advice and statements of legal counsel
(including, without limitation, counsel to the Company or the Servicer),
independent accountants and

                                       64
<Page>

other experts selected by the Funding Agent and shall not be liable for any
action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in accordance with the
advice of such counsel, accountants or experts. The Funding Agent may deem and
treat the payee of any Certificate as the owner thereof for all purposes unless
a written notice of assignment, negotiation or transfer thereof shall have been
filed with the Funding Agent. The Funding Agent shall be fully justified in
failing or refusing to take any action under this Supplement or any other
Transaction Document unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of
the Majority Purchasers as it deems appropriate or it shall first be indemnified
to its satisfaction by the Purchasers against any and all liability and expense
which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such
action. The Funding Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in
refraining from acting, under this Supplement and the other Transaction
Documents in accordance with a request of the Majority Purchasers, and such
request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding
upon all the Purchasers.

          SECTION 10.5   NOTICE OF SERVICER DEFAULT OR EARLY AMORTIZATION EVENT
OR POTENTIAL EARLY AMORTIZATION EVENT. The Funding Agent shall not be deemed to
have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Servicer Default with respect
to the Servicer or any Early Amortization Event or Potential Early Amortization
Event hereunder unless the Funding Agent has received notice from a Purchaser,
the Company or the Servicer referring to the Agreement or this Supplement,
describing such Servicer Default or Early Amortization Event or Potential Early
Amortization Event and stating that such notice is a "notice of a Servicer
Default with respect to the Servicer" or a "notice of an Early Amortization
Event or Potential Early Amortization Event", as the case may be. In the event
that the Funding Agent receives such a notice, the Funding Agent shall give
notice thereof to the Purchasers, the Trustee, the Company and the Servicer. The
Funding Agent shall take such action with respect to such Servicer Default or
Early Amortization Event or Potential Early Amortization Event as shall be
reasonably directed by the Majority Purchasers, PROVIDED that unless and until
the Funding Agent shall have received such directions, the Funding Agent may
(but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such
action, with respect to such Servicer Default or Early Amortization Event or
Potential Early Amortization Event as it shall deem advisable in the best
interests of the Purchasers.

          SECTION 10.6   NON-RELIANCE ON THE FUNDING AGENT AND OTHER PURCHASERS.
Each Purchaser expressly acknowledges that neither the Funding Agent nor any of
its officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates has
made any representations or warranties to it and that no act by the Funding
Agent hereinafter taken, including any review of the affairs of the Company or
the Servicer,

                                       65
<Page>

shall be deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by the Funding
Agent to any Purchaser. Each Purchaser represents to the Funding Agent that it
has, independently and without reliance upon the Funding Agent or any other
Purchaser, and based on such documents and information as it has deemed
appropriate, made its own appraisal of and investigation into the business,
operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the
Company or the Servicer and made its own decision to enter into this Supplement.
Each Purchaser also represents that it will, independently and without reliance
upon the Funding Agent or any other Purchaser, and based on such documents and
information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own
credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under
this Supplement and the other Transaction Documents, and to make such
investigation as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business,
operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the
Company and the Servicer. Except for notices, reports and other documents
expressly required to be furnished to the Purchasers by the Funding Agent
hereunder, the Funding Agent shall have no duty or responsibility to provide any
Purchaser with any credit or other information concerning the business,
operations, property, condition (financial or otherwise), prospects or
creditworthiness of the Company or the Servicer which may come into the
possession of the Funding Agent or any of its officers, directors, employees,
agents, attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates.

          SECTION 10.7   INDEMNIFICATION. The Purchasers agree to indemnify the
Funding Agent in its capacity as such (to the extent not reimbursed by the
Company and the Servicer and without limiting the obligation of the Company and
the Servicer to do so), ratably according to their respective Series 2003-1
Purchaser Invested Amounts on the date on which indemnification is sought, from
and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties,
actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind
whatsoever which may at any time be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against
the Funding Agent in any way relating to or arising out of the Commitments, this
Supplement, any of the other Transaction Documents or any documents contemplated
by or referred to herein or therein or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby or any action taken or omitted by the Funding Agent under or in
connection with any of the foregoing; PROVIDED that no Purchaser shall be liable
for the payment of any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses,
damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements
resulting solely from the Funding Agent's gross negligence or willful
misconduct. The agreements in this Section shall survive the payment of all
amounts payable hereunder.

                                       66

          SECTION 10.8   THE FUNDING AGENT IN ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY. The
Funding Agent and its Affiliates may make loans to, accept deposits from and
generally engage in any kind of business with the Company, the Servicer or any
of their Affiliates as though the Funding Agent were not the Funding Agent
hereunder. With respect to any VFC Certificate held by the Funding Agent, the
Funding Agent shall have the same rights and powers under this Supplement and
the other Transaction Documents as any Purchaser and may exercise the same as
though it were not the Funding Agent, and the terms "APA Bank" and "Purchaser"
shall include the Funding Agent in its individual capacity.

          SECTION 10.9   SUCCESSOR FUNDING AGENT. The Funding Agent may resign
as Funding Agent upon 10 days' written notice to the Purchasers (with a copy to
the Company). If the Funding Agent shall resign as Funding Agent under this
Supplement, then the Majority Purchasers shall appoint from among the Purchasers
a successor administrative agent for the Purchasers, which successor
administrative agent shall be approved by the Company and the Servicer (which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld), whereupon such successor
administrative agent shall succeed to the rights, powers and duties of the
Funding Agent, and the term "Funding Agent" shall mean such successor
administrative agent effective upon such appointment and approval, and the
former Funding Agent's rights, powers and duties as Funding Agent shall be
terminated, without any other or further act or deed on the part of such former
Funding Agent or any of the parties to this Supplement. If no successor
administrative agent has accepted appointment as "Funding Agent" by the date
that is 10 days following a retiring Funding Agent's notice of resignation, the
retiring Funding Agent's resignation shall nevertheless thereupon become
effective and the Purchasers shall perform all of the duties of the Funding
Agent hereunder until such time, if any, as the Majority Purchasers appoint a
successor agent as provided for above. After any retiring Funding Agent's
resignation as Funding Agent, the provisions of this Article 10 shall inure to
its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was
Funding Agent under this Supplement.

                                   ARTICLE XI

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

          SECTION 11.1   RATIFICATION OF AGREEMENT. As supplemented by this
Supplement, the Agreement is in all respects ratified and confirmed and the

construed as one and the same instrument.

          SECTION 11.2   GOVERNING LAW. THIS SUPPLEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY,
AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK AND THE
OBLIGATIONS, RIGHTS AND REMEDIES OF THE PARTIES HEREUNDER SHALL BE DETERMINED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH SUCH LAWS.

          SECTION 11.3   FURTHER ASSURANCES. Each of the Company, the Servicer
and the Trustee agrees, from time to time, to do and perform any and all acts
and to execute any and all further instruments required or reasonably requested
by the Funding Agent or the Majority Purchasers more fully to effect the
purposes of this Supplement and the sale of the VFC Certificates hereunder,
including, without limitation, in the case of the Company and the Servicer, the
execution of any financing or registration statements or similar documents or
notices or continuation statements relating to the Receivables and the other
Trust Assets for filing or registration under the provisions of the UCC or
similar legislation of any applicable jurisdiction.

          SECTION 11.4   PAYMENTS. To the extent proper payment instructions are
provided, each payment to be made hereunder shall be made on the required
payment date in lawful money of the United States and in immediately available
funds, if to the Purchasers, at the office of the Funding Agent set forth in
SECTION 11.9 no later than 11:00 a.m. Chicago time on the day when due, and if
not received before 11:00 a.m. Chicago time shall be deemed to be received on
the next succeeding Business Day. Except as provided in SECTION 2.6(e), on each
Distribution Date, the Funding Agent shall remit in like funds to each Purchaser
its applicable PRO RATA share (based on each such Purchaser's Series 2003-1
Purchaser Invested Amount) of each such payment received by the Funding Agent
for the account of the Purchasers.

          SECTION 11.5   COSTS AND EXPENSES. The Company agrees to reimburse the
Funding Agent, the Purchasers and Banc One Capital Markets for (i) all
reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including without limitation, and
to the extent reasonable, legal fees, due diligence and audit fees) incurred in
the negotiation, arrangement, and administration of this Supplement, the
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents and the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby and (ii) all out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including ,
without limitation, legal fees) incurred in the enforcement of this Supplement,
the Agreement and the other Transaction Documents. Legal fees and expenses
included under this provision may include fees and expenses of internal counsel
of the applicable party, provided that such fees and expenses are not for

retained by such applicable party.

<Page>

          SECTION 11.6   NO WAIVER, CUMULATIVE REMEDIES. No failure to exercise
and no delay in exercising, on the part of the Trustee, the Funding Agent or any
Purchaser, any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a
waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy,
power or privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or
the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege. The rights,
remedies, powers and privileges herein provided are cumulative and not
exhaustive of any rights, remedies, powers and privileges provided by law.

          SECTION 11.7   AMENDMENTS. (a) Subject to Section (c) of this SECTION
11.7, this Supplement may be amended in writing from time to time by the
Servicer, the Company and the Trustee, with the consent of the Funding Agent but
without the consent of any holder of any outstanding VFC Certificate, to cure
any ambiguity, to correct or supplement any provisions herein which may be
inconsistent with any other provisions herein or to add any other provisions to
or change in any manner or eliminate any of the provisions with respect to
matters or questions raised under this Supplement which shall not be
inconsistent with the provisions of any Pooling and Servicing Agreement;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that such action shall not, as evidenced by an Officer's
Certificate or, to the extent in the reasonable view of the Company, a question
of law exists, an Opinion of Counsel delivered to the Trustee, adversely affect
in any material respect the interests of the VFC Certificateholders, including
without limitation the tax status of the VFC Certificates or of the Trust, or
the APA Banks. The Trustee may, but shall not be obligated to, enter into any
such amendment pursuant to this paragraph or paragraph (b) below which affects
the Trustee's rights, duties or immunities under any Pooling and Servicing
Agreement or otherwise.

               (b)  Subject to Section (c) of this SECTION 11.7, this Supplement
may also be amended in writing from time to time by the Servicer, the Company
and the Trustee with the consent of the Majority Purchasers for the purpose of
adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the
provisions of this Supplement or of modifying in any manner the rights of the
VFC Certificateholders (including, without limitation, the acceleration of the
payment of sums payable to or for the account of the Purchasers under any
provision of this Supplement); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no such amendment shall,
unless signed or consented to in writing by all Purchasers and each APA Bank,
(i) extend the time for payment or deposit, or reduce the amount, of any sum
payable to or for the account of any Purchaser under any provision of this
Supplement or extend the Commitment Expiry Date, (ii) subject any Purchaser to

term (or any defined term used directly or indirectly in such defined term) used
in the foregoing clauses (i) through (vi) in a manner that would circumvent the
intention of the restrictions set forth in such clauses; and PROVIDED, FURTHER,

Agent's being party thereto; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no such amendment,
modification or waiver of this Supplement that affects rights or duties of the
Funding Agent shall be effective unless the Funding Agent shall have given its
prior written consent thereto.

          SECTION 11.8   SEVERABILITY. If any provision hereof is void or
unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such voidness or unenforceability shall not

          SECTION 11.10  SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS. This Supplement shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns, except that the Company may not assign or transfer any
of its rights under this Supplement without the prior written consent of all of
the Purchasers and each APA Bank may not assign or transfer any of its rights
under this Supplement except as set forth in SECTION 11.11. The Company, the
Servicer, the Funding Agent and each APA Bank hereby agrees and consents to the
complete or partial assignment by Initial Purchaser of all or any portion of its
rights under, interest in, title to and obligations under this Supplement to the
APA Banks pursuant to SECTION 2.6 or to any other Person, and upon such
assignment, Initial Purchaser shall be released from its obligations so
assigned. Further, the Company, the Servicer, the Funding Agent and each APA
Bank hereby agrees that any assignee of Initial Purchaser of this Supplement
shall have all of the rights and benefits under this Supplement as if the term
"Initial Purchaser" explicitly referred to such party, and no such assignment
shall in any way impair the rights and benefits of Initial Purchaser hereunder,
provided that the Series 2003-1 Purchaser Invested Amount of any such assignee
shall accrue Daily Interest Expense pursuant to clause (ii) of the definition
thereof as if such assignee were an APA Bank hereunder.

          SECTION 11.11  SECURITIES LAWS; PARTICIPATIONS; ASSIGNMENTS. (a) Each
Purchaser represents and warrants to the Company that it is a "qualified
institutional buyer" within the meaning of Rule 144A promulgated under the
Securities Act and agrees that its VFC Certificate will be acquired for
investment only and not with a view to any public distribution thereof, and that
such Purchaser

                                       71
<Page>

will not offer to sell or otherwise dispose of its VFC Certificate (or any
interest therein) in violation of any of the registration requirements of the
Securities Act or any applicable state or other securities laws. Each Purchaser
acknowledges that it has no right to require the Company to register its VFC
Certificate under the Securities Act or any other securities law. Each Purchaser
hereby confirms and agrees that in connection with any transfer by it of an
interest in the VFC Certificate, such Purchaser has not engaged and will not
engage in a general solicitation or general advertising including
advertisements, articles, notices or other communications published in any
newspaper, magazine or similar media or broadcast over radio or television, or
any seminar or meeting whose attendees have been invited by any general
solicitation or general advertising.

               (b)  Any APA Bank may, in the ordinary course of its business and
in accordance with applicable law, at any time sell to one or more financial
institutions or other entities ("PARTICIPANTS") participations in its VFC
Certificate and its rights hereunder pursuant to documentation in form and
substance satisfactory to such APA Bank and the Participant; PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
that (i) in the event of any such sale by an APA Bank to a Participant, (A) such
APA Bank's obligations under this Supplement shall remain unchanged, (B) such
APA Bank shall remain solely responsible for the performance thereof and (C) the
Company shall continue to deal solely and directly with such APA Bank in
connection with its rights and obligations under the Pooling and Servicing
Agreements, (ii) no APA Bank shall sell any participating interest under which
the Participant shall have rights to approve any amendment to, or any consent or
waiver with respect to, any Pooling and Servicing Agreement, except to the
extent that the approval of such amendment, consent or waiver otherwise would
require the unanimous consent of all APA Banks hereunder, (iii) no sale by an
APA Bank to a Participant shall be given effect if such sale would result in
there being more than 20 Targeted Holders with respect to the VFC Certificates
or is not otherwise permitted under Section 5.3(e) of the Agreement, and (iv)
each Participant shall, prior to becoming a Participant, execute and deliver to
the Funding Agent an Assignment/Participation Certification. The Company agrees
that each APA Bank is entitled, in its own name, to enforce for the benefit of,
or as agent for, any Participant any and all rights, claims and interest of such
Participant in respect of the Trust and the Company's obligations under this
Supplement. A Participant shall have the right to receive payments under Article
VII in respect of its participation but only to the extent that the related
selling APA Bank would have had such right absent the sale of the related
participation.

               (c)  Any APA Bank may, upon the satisfaction of all applicable
requirements under Section 5.3 of the Agreement, in the ordinary course of its
business and in accordance with applicable law, at any time sell all or any part

                                       72
<Page>

of its rights and obligations under this Supplement and the VFC Certificate to
(i) its Affiliates and to any other APA Bank and (ii) upon prior written notice
to the Funding Agent, one or more banks or other entities (an "ACQUIRING APA
BANK"), in each case pursuant to a commitment transfer supplement, substantially
in the form of Exhibit G (the "COMMITMENT TRANSFER SUPPLEMENT"), executed by
such Acquiring APA Bank, such assigning APA Bank and the Funding Agent (and, in
the case of an Acquiring APA Bank that is not then an existing APA Bank or an
Affiliate thereof, by the Company and the Servicer, provided that no execution
by the Company and the Servicer shall be required in the case of SECTION
11.11(h) or if an Early Amortization Event has occurred and is continuing), and
delivered to the Funding Agent for its acceptance and recording in the Register.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no APA Bank shall so sell its rights hereunder
(other than to its Affiliate or any other APA Bank) without the prior written
consent of the Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld
(provided, that no such consent shall be required in the case of SECTION
11.11(h) or if an Early Amortization Event has occurred and is continuing), and
no APA Bank shall sell its rights hereunder (w) if such sale would result in
there being more than 20 Targeted Holders with respect to the VFC Certificates
or more than 20 beneficial owners of the VFC Certificates for the purposes of
the 1940 Act or is not otherwise permitted under Section 5.3(e) of the
Agreement, (x) if such Acquiring APA Bank is not an Eligible Assignee, (y)
unless such APA Bank reasonably believes that such Acquiring APA Bank is a
"qualified institutional buyer" within the meaning of Rule 144A promulgated
under the Securities Act and (z) unless, prior to such sale, the purchaser of
such rights shall have executed and delivered to the Funding Agent and the
Transfer Agent and Registrar an Assignment/Participation Certification. Upon
such execution, delivery, acceptance and recording, (A) the Company shall sign,
on behalf of the Trust, and shall direct the Trustee in writing to duly
authenticate, and the Trustee, upon receiving such direction, shall so
authenticate, a new VFC Certificate in the name and the denomination determined
pursuant to the related Commitment Transfer Supplement and set forth in such
written direction and shall deliver such VFC Certificate to the Acquiring APA
Bank in accordance with such written direction, and (B) from and after the
Transfer Issuance Date determined pursuant to such Commitment Transfer
Supplement, (1) the Acquiring APA Bank thereunder shall be a party hereto and,
to the extent provided in such Commitment Transfer Supplement, have the rights
and obligations of an APA Bank hereunder with a Commitment as set forth therein
and (2) the transferor APA Bank thereunder shall, to the extent provided in such
Commitment Transfer Supplement, be released from its obligations under this
Supplement. Such Commitment Transfer Supplement shall be deemed to amend this
Supplement (including the Schedules attached hereto) to the extent, and only to
the extent, necessary to reflect the addition of such Acquiring APA Bank as

                                       73
<Page>

an "APA Bank" and the resulting adjustment of Pro Rata Shares arising from the
purchase by such Acquiring APA Bank of all or a portion of the rights and
obligations of such transferor APA Bank under this Supplement and the VFC
Certificates.

               (d)  The Funding Agent shall maintain at its address referred to
in SECTION 11.9 a copy of each Commitment Transfer Supplement delivered to it.

               (e)  Upon its receipt of a Commitment Transfer Supplement
executed by a transferor APA Bank and an Acquiring APA Bank (and, in the case of
a Transferee that is not then an existing APA Bank or an Affiliate thereof, by
the Company and the Servicer) and a processing fee of $3,500, the Funding Agent
shall (i) promptly accept such Commitment Transfer Supplement and (ii) on the
Transfer Issuance Date determined pursuant thereto record the information
contained therein in the Register and give notice of such acceptance and
recordation to Initial Purchaser, the APA Banks, the Servicer and the Company.

               (f)  The Company and the Servicer each authorizes each APA Bank
to disclose to any Participant or Acquiring APA Bank (each, a "TRANSFEREE") and
any prospective Transferee any and all financial information in such APA Bank's
possession concerning the Company, the Servicer or the Receivables which has
been delivered to such APA Bank by the Company or the Servicer pursuant to this
Supplement or which has been delivered to such APA Bank by or on behalf of the
Company in connection with such APA Bank's credit evaluation of the Company, the
Servicer, the Trust and the Trust Assets prior to becoming a party to this
Supplement; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, the Transferee or prospective Transferee shall
have agreed to be bound by the terms and conditions of Section 11.15.

               (g)  Notwithstanding any other provisions herein, no transfer or
assignment of any interests or obligations of any APA Bank hereunder or any
grant of participations therein shall be permitted if such transfer, assignment
or grant would result in a prohibited transaction under Section 4975 of the
Internal Revenue Code or Section 406 of ERISA or cause the Trust Assets to be
regarded as plan assets pursuant to 29 C.F.R. Section 2510.3-101.

               (h)  Each of the APA Banks agrees that in the event that it shall
cease to have a short-term debt rating of A-1 or better by S&P and P-1 by
Moody's (an "AFFECTED APA BANK"), such Affected APA Bank shall be obliged, at
the request of Initial Purchaser or the Funding Agent, to assign all of its
rights and

                                       74
<Page>

obligations hereunder to (x) another APA Bank or (y) another funding entity
nominated by the Funding Agent and acceptable to Initial Purchaser, and willing
to participate in this Supplement through the Commitment Expiry Date in the
place of such Affected APA Bank; PROVIDED that the Affected APA Bank receives an
amount equal to its Series 2003-1 Purchaser Invested Amount, accrued interest
thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder from the
assignee (to the extent of such Series 2003-1 Purchaser Invested Amount and
accrued interest and fees) or the Company (in the case of all other amounts).

          SECTION 11.12  ADJUSTMENTS; SET-OFF. (a) If any Purchaser (a
"BENEFITTED PURCHASER") shall at any time receive in respect of its Series
2003-1 Invested Amount any distribution of principal, interest, Commitment Fees
or other fees, or any interest thereon, or receive any collateral in respect
thereof (whether voluntarily or involuntarily, by set-off or otherwise) in a
greater proportion than any such distribution received by any other Purchaser,
if any, in respect of such other Purchaser's Series 2003-1 Invested Amount, or
interest thereon, such Benefitted Purchaser shall purchase for cash from the
other Purchasers such portion of each such other Purchaser's interest in the VFC
Certificates, or shall provide such other Purchasers with the benefits of any
such collateral, or the proceeds thereof, as shall be necessary to cause such
Benefitted Purchaser to share the excess payment or benefits of such collateral
or proceeds ratably with each of the Purchasers; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if all
or any portion of such excess payment or benefits is thereafter recovered from
such Benefitted Purchaser, such purchase shall be rescinded, and the purchase
price and benefits returned, to the extent of such recovery, but without
interest. The Company agrees that each Purchaser so purchasing a portion of the
VFC Certificateholders' Interest may exercise all rights of payment (including,
without limitation, rights of set-off) with respect to such portion as fully as
if such Purchaser were the direct holder of such portion.

               (b)  In addition to any rights and remedies of the Purchasers
provided by law, each Purchaser shall have the right, without prior notice to
the Company, any such notice being expressly waived by the Company to the extent
permitted by applicable law, upon any amount becoming due and payable by the
Company hereunder or under the VFC Certificates to set-off and appropriate and
apply against any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand,
provisional or final), in any currency, and any other credits, indebtedness or
claims, in any currency, in each case whether direct or indirect, absolute or
contingent, matured or unmatured, at any time held or owing by such Purchaser to
or for the credit or the account of the Company. Each Purchaser agrees promptly
to notify the Company and the Funding Agent after any such set-off and
application made by such

                                       75
<Page>

Purchaser, PROVIDED that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the
validity of such set-off and application.

          SECTION 11.13  COUNTERPARTS. This Supplement may be executed in any
number of counterparts and by the different parties hereto in separate
counterparts, each of which when so executed shall be deemed to be an original,
and all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.

          SECTION 11.14  NO BANKRUPTCY PETITION. (a) The Funding Agent and each
Purchaser hereby covenants and agrees that, prior to the date which is one year
