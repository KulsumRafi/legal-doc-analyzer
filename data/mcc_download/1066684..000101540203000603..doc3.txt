               outstanding  principal  and interest, shall be due and payable on
               the  Loan  Payment Date, except in the event Lender elects not to
               exercise  the  Purchase  Option,  described in the Loan Agreement
               (incorporated  herein  and  made  a  part  hereof)  (hereinafter
