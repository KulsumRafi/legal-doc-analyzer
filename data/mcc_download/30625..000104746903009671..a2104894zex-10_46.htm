Corporation, a New York corporation (the "Company" or "Corporation"), hereby establishes this plan to be known as the "Flowserve Corporation </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><B><I>Executive Officer</I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> Change in Control Severance Plan"
(the "Plan") as set forth in this document. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.02&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company may from time-to-time become involved in possible Change in Control situations. Should this occur, in addition to their regular
duties, Employees may be called upon to assist in the assessment of any third-party or internal proposals, advise management and the Board as to whether such proposals would be in the best interests
of the Company and its shareholders, participate in successfully completing such transactions and take such other actions as the Board might determine appropriate. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.03&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This
Plan has been established for the purpose of assuring that the Company will have the continued dedication of the Participants, and the availability of
Participants' advice and counsel as to the best interests of the Company and its shareholders, notwithstanding the possibility, threat, or occurrence of a Change in Control, and to induce Participants
to remain in the employ of the Company through the provision of certain protections in the event of a qualifying Change in Control. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.04&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
approved by the Compensation Committee, the Plan shall become effective as of January&nbsp;1, 2002 and shall remain in effect until terminated by the Committee. </FONT></P>

demonstrably injurious to the Company, monetarily or otherwise; provided, however, that if the Participant has entered into an employment agreement that is binding as of the date of the event or
action otherwise determined to be "Cause," and if such employment agreement defines "Cause," such definition of "Cause" shall apply. No act, or failure to act, shall be considered "willful" if, in the
Participant's sole judgment, the action or omission was done, or omitted to be done, in good faith and with a reasonable belief that his action or omission was in the best interest of the Company.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Participant shall not be deemed to have terminated for Cause unless and until there shall have been delivered to him a copy of a resolution duly adopted by the
affirmative vote of not less than three-quarters (<SUP>3</SUP>/<SMALL>4</SMALL>) of the entire authorized membership of the Board, or, if after a Change in Control, the Incumbent Board, at a meeting of the Board
or Incumbent Board, as appropriate, called and held for the purpose (after reasonable notice to the Participant and an opportunity for the Participant, together with counsel, to be heard before the
Board or 2.04 Incumbent Board, as appropriate), finding that in the good faith opinion of the Board or Incumbent Board the Participant was guilty of conduct set forth above in clause&nbsp;(A) or
(B)&nbsp;of this Article&nbsp;2.03, and specifying the particulars thereof in detail. </FONT></P>

the Participant unless the Participant notifies the Company within twenty-one (21)&nbsp;days after the Participant receives the Company's determination and calculations that the
Participant disputes the same. If, within ten

determination and calculations, then the Company and the Participant shall, within three (3)&nbsp;days thereafter, choose a nationally recognized accounting firm (the "Accounting Firm") to deliver
its determination (and supporting calculations) concerning the matter(s) in dispute. The Accounting Firm's determination shall be delivered to the Company and the Participant within twenty

calculations, if the final determination by the Accounting Firm is more than 2% different from the determination proposed by the Company, then the Company shall pay or reimburse all costs incurred by
the Participant with respect to such determination. In all other cases, the Participant shall pay all such costs. All costs incurred by the Company in connection with such determination and contest,

as a result of such claim or demand, if such member of the Board acted in good faith for a purpose which he reasonably believed to be in accordance with the intent of the Plan and, in criminal actions
or proceedings, in addition, had no reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful. </FONT></P>

termination of any such civil or criminal action or proceeding or the disposition of any such claim or demand, by judgment, settlement, conviction or upon a plea

believed to be in accordance with the intent of the Plan. </FONT></P>

the failure of the Company to provide indemnification in the manner set forth in Article&nbsp;11.01 above, and despite any contrary resolution of the
Board or of the shareholders in the specific case, if the member of the Board has met the standard of conduct set forth in Article&nbsp;11.01 above, the person made or threatened to be made a party
to the action or proceeding or against whom the claim or demand has been made, shall have the legal right to indemnification from the Company as a matter of contract by virtue of this Plan, it being
the intention that each such person shall have the right to enforce such right of indemnification against the Company in any court of competent jurisdiction. </FONT></P>
