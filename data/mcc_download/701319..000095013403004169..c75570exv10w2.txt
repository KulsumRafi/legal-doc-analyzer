                                                                    EXHIBIT 10.2

                              EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT

         Agreement dated as of March 5, 2003, between Computer Network
Technology Corporation, a Minnesota corporation, having a place of business at
6000 Nathan Lane North, Plymouth, MN 55442 (the "Company"), and Gregory T.
Barnum (the "Executive").

                                   WITNESSETH

         WHEREAS, the Executive has assumed duties of a responsible nature to
the benefit of the Company and to the satisfaction of the Board of Directors
(the "Board") of the Company and its Compensation Committee;

         WHEREAS, the Board and its Compensation Committee believes it to be in
the best interests of the Company to enter into this Agreement to assure
Executive's continuing services to the Company including, but not limited to,
under circumstances in which there is a Change of Control (as defined below);

         WHEREAS, the Board and its Compensation Committee believes it is
imperative to diminish the inevitable distraction of the Executive by virtue of
the personal uncertainties and risks created by a pending or threatened Change
of Control and to encourage the Executive's full attention and dedication to the
Company currently and in the event of any threatened or pending Change of
Control, and to provide the Executive with compensation and benefits
arrangements upon a Change of Control which ensure that the compensation and
benefits expectations of the Executive will be satisfied and which are
competitive with those of other corporations; and

         WHEREAS, in order to accomplish all the above objectives, the Board and
its Compensation Committee has authorized the Company to enter into this
Agreement;

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises herein
contained, the Company and the Executive hereby agree as follows:

         1.       CERTAIN DEFINITIONS.

                  (a)      The "Effective Date" shall mean the date hereof.

                  (b)      The "Change of Control Date" shall mean the first
         date during the Employment Period (as defined in Section 1(d)) on which
         a Change of Control (as defined in Section 2) occurs. Anything in this
         Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, if a Change of Control
         occurs and if the Executive's employment with the Company is terminated
         or the Executive ceases to be Chief Financial Officer ("CFO") of the
         Company prior to the date on which the Change of Control occurs, and if
         it is reasonably demonstrated by the Executive that such termination of
         employment or cessation of status as CFO (i) was at the request of a
         third party who has taken steps reasonably calculated to effect the
         Change of Control or (ii) otherwise arose in connection with or
         anticipation of the Change of Control, then for all purposes of this
         Agreement the

                                       1

<PAGE>

         "Change of Control Date" shall mean the date immediately prior to the

                  (c)      "Compensation Committee" shall mean the Compensation
          Committee of the Board of Directors.

                  (d)      The "Employment Period" shall mean the period

         (i) the third anniversary of such date or (ii) the first day of the
         month next following the Executive's 65th birthday ("Normal Retirement
         Date"); provided, however, that on each anniversary of the Effective
         Date, and on each successive annual anniversary of such date thereafter
         (such date and each annual anniversary thereof shall be hereinafter
         referred to as the "Renewal Date"), the Employment Period shall be
         automatically extended so as to terminate on the earlier of (x) three
         years from such Renewal Date or (y) the Executive's Normal Retirement
         Date, unless at least 90 days prior to the Renewal Date the Company
         shall give notice to the Executive that the Employment Period shall not
         be so extended; and provided, further, that upon the occurrence of a
         Change of Control Date, the Employment Period shall automatically be
         extended so as to terminate on the earlier to occur of (1) the third
         anniversary of such date or (2) the Executive's Normal Retirement Date.

         2.       CHANGE OF CONTROL. For the purpose of this Agreement, a
"Change of Control" or "Change in Control" shall mean:

                  (a)      The acquisition by an individual, entity or group
         (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) or 14(d)(2) of the Securities
         Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")) of beneficial
         ownership (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the
         Exchange Act) of 40% or more of either (i) the then outstanding shares
         of common stock of Company (the "Outstanding Company Common Stock") or
         (ii) the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting
         securities of the Company entitled to vote generally in the election of
         directors (the "Outstanding Company Voting Securities"); provided,
         however, that the following acquisitions shall not constitute a Change
         of Control: (w) any acquisition directly from the Company, (x) any
         acquisition by the Company or any of its subsidiaries, (y) any
         acquisition by any employee benefit plan (or related trust) sponsored
         or maintained by the Company or any of its subsidiaries or (z) any
         acquisition by any corporation with respect to which, following such
         acquisition, more than 60% of, respectively, the then outstanding
         shares of common stock of such corporation and the combined voting
         power of the then outstanding voting securities of such corporation
         entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, is then
         beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, by all or substantially all
         of the individuals and entities who were beneficial owners,
         respectively of the Outstanding Company Common Stock and Outstanding
         Company Voting Securities in substantially the same proportions as
         their ownership, immediately prior to such acquisition, of the
         Outstanding Company Common Stock and Outstanding Company Voting
         Securities, as the case may be; or

                                       2

<PAGE>

                  (b)      Individuals who, as of the date hereof, constitute
         the Company's Board of Directors (the "Incumbent Board") cease for any
         reason to constitute at least a majority of the Company Board of
         Directors; provided, however, that any individual becoming a director
         subsequent to the date hereof whose election, or nomination for
         election by the Company's shareholders, was approved by a vote of at
         least a majority of the directors then comprising the Incumbent Board
         shall be considered as though such individual were a member of the
         Incumbent Board, but excluding, for this purpose, any such individual
         whose initial assumption of office occurs as a result of either an
         actual or threatened election contest (as such terms are used in Rule
         14a-11 of Regulation 14A promulgated under the Exchange Act) or other
         actual or threatened solicitation of proxies or consents; or

                  (c)      Completion by the Company of a reorganization, merger
         or consolidation, in each case, with respect to which all or
         substantially all of the individuals and entities who were the
         beneficial owners, respectively, of the Outstanding Company Common
         Stock and Outstanding Company Voting Securities immediately prior to
         such reorganization, merger or consolidation, beneficially own,
         directly or indirectly, less than 60% of, respectively, of the then
         outstanding shares of common stock and the combined voting power of the
         then outstanding voting securities entitled to vote generally in the
         election of directors, as the case may be, of the corporation resulting
         from such reorganization, merger or consolidation in substantially the
         same proportions as their ownership, immediately prior to such
         reorganization, merger or consolidation of the Outstanding Company
         Common Stock and the Outstanding Company Voting Securities, as the case
         may be; or

                  (d) Completion by the Company of (i) a complete liquidation or
         dissolution of Company or (ii) the sale or other disposition of all or
         substantially all of the assets of the Company, other than to a
         corporation, with respect to which following such sale or other
         disposition, more than 60% of, respectively, the then outstanding
         shares of common stock of such corporation and the combined voting
         power of the then outstanding voting securities of such corporation
         entitled to vote generally in the election of directors is then
         beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, by all or substantially all
         of the individuals and entities who were the beneficial owners,
         respectively, of the Outstanding Company Common Stock and Outstanding
         Company Voting Securities immediately prior to such sale or other
         disposition in substantially the same proportion as their ownership,
         immediately prior to such sale or other disposition, of the Outstanding
         Company Common Stock and Outstanding Company Voting Securities, as the
         case may be.

         3.       EMPLOYMENT PERIOD. The Company hereby agrees to continue the
Executive in its employ, and the Executive hereby agrees to remain in the employ
of the Company, during the Employment Period under the terms and conditions
provided herein.

                  (a)      Position and Duties.

                           (i)      During the Employment Period and prior to a
                  Change of Control Date, (A) if the Board determines that the
                  Executive has been performing his duties in accordance with
                  Section 4(a)(iii) hereof, the Board shall re-appoint the

                  Date, and (B) the Executive's services shall be performed at
                  the Executive's location on the Effective Date, the Company's
                  headquarters, or a location where a substantial activity for
                  which the Executive has responsibility is located.

                           (ii)     During the Employment Period and on and
                  following a Change of Control Date, (A) the Executive's
                  position (including status, offices, titles and reporting
                  relationships), authority, duties and responsibilities shall
                  be at least commensurate in all material respects with the
                  most significant of those held, exercised and assigned at any
                  time during the 180-day period immediately preceding the
                  Change of Control Date and (B) the Executive's services shall
                  be performed at the location where the Executive was employed
                  immediately preceding the Change of Control Date or any office
                  or location less than fifty (50) miles from such location.

                           (iii)    During the Employment Period, and excluding
                  any periods of vacation and sick leave to which the Executive
                  is entitled, the Executive agrees to devote reasonable
                  attention and time during normal business hours to the
                  business and affairs the Company and, to the extent necessary
                  to discharge the responsibilities assigned to the Executive
                  hereunder, to use the Executive's reasonable best efforts to
                  perform faithfully and efficiently such responsibilities.
                  During the Employment Period it shall not be a violation of
                  this Agreement for the Executive to (A) serve on corporate,
                  civic or charitable boards or committees, (B) deliver
                  lectures, fulfill speaking engagements or teach at educational
                  institutions and (C) manage personal investments, so long as
                  such activities do not significantly interfere with the
                  performance of the Executive's responsibilities as an employee
                  of the Company in accordance with this Agreement. It is also
                  expressly understood and agreed that to the extent that such
                  activities have been conducted by the Executive prior to the
                  Effective Date, the continued conduct of such activities (or
                  the conduct of activities similar in nature and scope thereto)
                  subsequent to the Effective Date shall not thereafter be
                  deemed to interfere with the performance of the Executive's
                  responsibilities to the Company.

                  (b)      Compensation.

                           (i)      Base Salary. During the Employment Period,
                  the Company shall pay the Executive a base salary (x) through
                  April 30, 2003, at an annual rate of

                                       4

<PAGE>

                  $200,000, and (y) from and after May 1, 2003, at an annual
                  rate of $210,000 and during each succeeding 12 month period
                  ending April 30, at a rate not less than his base salary in
                  effect on the last day of the preceding 12-month period ending
                  April 30. During the Employment Period, base salary shall be
                  reviewed at least annually and shall be adjusted as agreed
                  between the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors
                  and Executive (in the event no agreement is reached, Base
                  Salary shall remain unchanged). Any increase in base salary
                  shall not serve to limit or reduce any other obligation to the
                  Executive under this Agreement. Base Salary shall not be
                  reduced after any such increase except in connection with
                  Company wide reductions applied to other senior executives of
                  the Company. Base salary under Section 4(b)(i) shall
                  hereinafter be referred to as the "Base Salary."

                           (ii)     Additional Compensation. In addition to Base
                  Salary, the Executive shall participate in the Company's
                  Success Share Bonus Arrangement under terms and conditions
                  determined each year by the Compensation Committee of the
                  Board of Directors of the Company (which, beginning May 1,
                  2003, shall be a 60% incentive opportunity for the applicable
                  year).

                           (iii)    Fringe Benefits. While Executive is employed
                  by the Company under this Agreement, the Company shall provide
                  Executive such insurance and other benefits as are provided
                  from time to time by the Company to its other executives, in
                  accordance with the Company's benefits practices then in
                  effect.

         5.       TERMINATION.

                  (a)      Death or Disability. This Agreement shall terminate
         automatically upon the Executive's death. If the Company determines in
         good faith that the Disability of the Executive has occurred (pursuant
         to the definition of "Disability" set forth below), it may give to the
         Executive written notice of its intention to terminate the Executive's
         employment hereunder. In such event, the Executive's employment with
         the Company shall terminate effective on the 90th day after receipt by
         the Executive of such notice given at any time after a period of six
         consecutive months of Disability and while such Disability is
         continuing (the "Disability Effective Date"), provided that, within the
         90 days after such receipt, the Executive shall not have returned to
         full-time performance of the Executive's duties. For purposes of this
         Agreement, "Disability" means disability which, at least six months
         after its commencement, is determined to be total and permanent by a
         physician selected by the Company or its insurers and acceptable to the
         Executive or the Executive's legal representative (such agreement as to
         acceptability not to be withheld unreasonably). During such six month
         period and until the Disability Effective Date, Executive shall be
         entitled to all compensation provided for under Section 4 hereof.

                  (b)      Cause. During the Employment Period, the Company may
         terminate the Executive's employment with the Company for "Cause." For
         purposes of this Agreement,

                                       5

<PAGE>

         "Cause" means (i) an act or acts of personal dishonesty taken by the
         Executive and intended to result in substantial personal enrichment of
         the Executive at the expense of the Company, (ii) willful failure to
         follow the reasonable directions of the Company or repeated violations
         by the Executive of the Executive's obligations under Section 4(a) of
         this Agreement which are demonstrably willful and deliberate on the
         Executive's part and in each case which are not remedied in a
         reasonable period of time after receipt of written notice from the
         Company or (iii) the conviction of the Executive of a felony.

                  (c)      Good Reason. During the Employment Period, the
         Executive's employment hereunder may be terminated by the Executive for
         Good Reason. For purposes of this Agreement, "Good Reason" means:

                           (i)      the assignment to the Executive of any
                  duties inconsistent in any respect with Executive's position
                  (including status, offices, titles and reporting
                  relationships), authority, duties or responsibilities as
                  contemplated by Section 4(a)(i) or (ii) of this Agreement
                  (including, without limitation, Executive ceasing to be the
                  Chief Financial Officer of the Company), or any other action
                  by the Company which results in a diminution in such position,
                  authority, duties or responsibilities;

                           (ii)     the failure by the Company to appoint the
                  Executive to the position of CFO or any other action by the
                  Company which results in the diminution of the Executive's
                  position, authority, duties, or responsibilities

                           (iii)    (x) any failure by the Company to comply
                  with any of the provisions of Section 4(b) of this Agreement
                  or (y) after the Change of Control Date, any failure of the
                  Company to pay Base Salary in accordance with Section 4(b)(i)
                  or failure to pay Additional Compensation on a basis
                  comparable (with respect to targets and incentive opportunity)
                  to that applicable to the Executive with respect to the year
                  immediately preceding the year in which the Change in Control
                  occurs;

                           (iv)     the Company requiring the Executive to be
                  based at any office or location other than that described in
                  Sections 4(a)(i)(B) or 4(a)(ii)(B) hereof, except for travel
                  reasonably required in the performance of the Executive's
                  responsibilities;

                           (v)      any purported termination by the Company of
                  the Executive's employment otherwise than as expressly
                  permitted by this Agreement; or

                           (vi)     any failure by the Company to comply with
                  and satisfy Section 12(c) of this Agreement.

                  Prior to giving a Notice of Termination for Good Reason,
         Executive shall notify the Company within 30 days of action the Company
         has taken in such 30 day period, together with any other similar
         actions within the prior six months, which Executive believes
         constitutes Good Reason. The Company shall have 30 days to cure such

                                       6

<PAGE>

         circumstances, and if not cured to the reasonable satisfaction of the
         Executive, then Executive may give such Notice of Termination for Good
         Reason.

                  (d)      Notice of Termination. Any termination of the
         Executive's employment hereunder by the Company for Cause or by the
         Executive for Good Reason shall be communicated by Notice of
         Termination to such other party hereto given in accordance with Section
         14(b) of this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, a "Notice of
         Termination" means a written notice which (i) indicates the specific
         termination provision in this Agreement relied upon, (ii) sets forth in
         reasonable detail the facts and circumstances claimed to provide a
         basis for termination of the Executive's employment under the provision
         so indicated and (iii) if the Date of Termination (as defined below) is
         other than the date of receipt of such notice, specifies the
         termination date (which date shall be not more than fifteen (15) days
         after the giving of such notice). Further, a Notice of Termination for
         Cause is required to include a copy of a resolution duly adopted by the
         affirmative vote of not less than three-quarters (3/4) of the entire
         membership of the Board (excluding the Executive) at a meeting of the
         Board which was called and held for the purpose of considering such
         termination (after reasonable notice to the Executive and an
         opportunity for the Executive, together with the Executive's counsel,
         to be heard before the Board) finding that, in the good faith opinion
         of the Board, the Executive was guilty of conduct set forth in the
         definition of Cause herein, and specifying the particulars thereof in
         detail.

                  (e)      Date of Termination. "Date of Termination" means the
         date of receipt of the Notice of Termination or any later date
         specified therein, as the case may be; provided, however, that (i) if
         the Executive's employment hereunder is terminated by the Company other
         than for Cause or Disability, the Date of Termination shall be the date
         on which the Company notifies the Executive of such termination and
         (ii) if the Executive's employment hereunder is terminated by reason of
         death or Disability, the Date of Termination shall be the date of death
         of the Executive or the Disability Effective Date, as the case may be.

         6.       OBLIGATIONS OF THE COMPANY UPON TERMINATION.

                  (a)      Death. If the Executive's employment hereunder is
         terminated by reason of the Executive's death, this Agreement shall
         terminate without further obligations to the Executive's legal
         representatives under this Agreement, other than those obligations
         accrued or earned and vested (if applicable) by the Executive as of the
         Date of Termination, including, for this purpose (i) the Executive's
         full Base Salary through the Date of Termination at the rate in effect
         on the Date of Termination, disregarding any reduction in Base Salary
         in violation of this Agreement (the "Highest Base Salary") and (ii) any
         compensation previously deferred by the Executive (together with any
         accrued interest thereon) and not yet paid by the Company in accordance
         with the applicable plan (to the extent vested) and any accrued
         vacation pay not yet paid by the Company (such amounts specified in
         clauses (i) and (ii) are hereinafter referred to as "Accrued
         Obligations"). All such Accrued Obligations shall be paid to the
         Executive's estate or

                                       7

         beneficiary, as applicable, in a lump sum in cash within 30 days of the
         Date of Termination. Anything in this Agreement to the contrary
         notwithstanding, the Executive's family shall be entitled to receive
         benefits at least equal to the most favorable benefits provided by the
         Company and any of its subsidiaries to surviving families of employees
         of the Company and such subsidiaries under such plans, programs,
         practices and policies relating to family death benefits, if any, in
         accordance with the most favorable plans, programs, practices and
         policies of the Company and its subsidiaries in effect on the date of
         the Executive's death with respect to other key employees of the
         Company and its subsidiaries and their families.

                  (b)      Disability. If the Executive's employment is
         terminated by reason of the Executive's Disability, this Agreement
         shall terminate without further obligations to the Executive, other
         than those obligations accrued or earned and vested (if applicable) by
         the Executive as of the Date of Termination, including for this
         purpose, all Accrued Obligations. All such Accrued Obligations shall be
         paid to the Executive in a lump sum in cash within 30 days of the Date
         of Termination. Anything in this Agreement to the contrary
         notwithstanding, the Executive shall be entitled after the Disability
         Effective Date to receive disability and other benefits at least equal
         to the most favorable of those provided by the Company and its
         subsidiaries to disabled employees and/or their families in accordance
         with such plans, programs, practices and policies relating to
         disability, if any, in accordance with the most favorable plans,
         programs, practices and policies of the Company and its subsidiaries in
         effect on or after the Effective Date or, if more favorable to the
         Executive and /or the Executive's family, as in effect at any time
         thereafter with respect to other key employees of the Company and its
         subsidiaries and their families.

                  (c)      Cause; Other than for Good Reason. If the Executive's
         employment shall be terminated for Cause, this Agreement shall
         terminate without further obligations to the Executive other than those
         obligations accrued or earned and vested (if applicable) by the
         Executive as of the Date of Termination, including for this purpose all
         Accrued Obligations. If the Executive terminates employment other than
         for Good Reason, this Agreement shall terminate without further
         obligations to the Executive, other than those obligations accrued or
         earned and vested (if applicable) by the Executive through the Date of
         Termination, including for this purpose, all Accrued Obligations. All
         such Accrued Obligations shall be paid to the Executive in a lump sum
         in cash within 30 days of the Date of Termination.

                  (d)      Good Reason; Other Than for Cause, Disability or
         Death.

                           (1)      If, during the Employment Period and prior
                  to a Change of Control the Company shall terminate the
                  Executive's employment hereunder other than for Cause,
                  Disability, or death or if the Executive shall terminate his
                  employment hereunder for Good Reason:

                                    (i)      the Company shall pay to the
                           Executive in a lump sum in cash within thirty (30)

                                    occurred; and

                                             C.   (I) in the case of

                                             F.   the Company shall provide the
                                    Executive with tax planning and financial
                                    counseling services for a period of three
                                    years following the Date of Termination on
                                    the same basis as such services were
                                    provided or made available to him
                                    immediately prior to the Date of Termination
                                    or the Change of Control Date, whichever is
                                    more favorable.

                  (e)      All of Executive's unvested options shall immediately
         vest upon completion of a Change of Control, if at the time of
         completion such options are not substituted or continued by the
         acquiror, regardless of whether Executive's employment is terminated.

         7.       NON-EXCLUSIVITY OF RIGHTS. Nothing in this Agreement shall
prevent or limit the Executive's continuing or future participation in any
benefit, bonus, incentive or other plans, programs, policies or practices,
provided by Company, the Company or any of their respective subsidiaries and for
which the Executive may qualify, nor shall anything herein limit or otherwise
affect such rights as the Executive may have under any stock option, restricted
stock or other agreements with Company, the Company or any of their respective
subsidiaries. Amounts which are vested benefits or which the Executive is
otherwise entitled to receive under any plan, policy, practice or program of
Company, the Company or any of their respective subsidiaries at or subsequent to
the Date of Termination shall be payable in accordance with such plan, policy
practice or program.

         8.       FULL SETTLEMENT. The Company's obligation to make the payments
provided for in this Agreement and otherwise to perform its obligations
hereunder shall not be affected by any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment,
defense or other claim, right or action which the Company may have against the
Executive or others. In no event shall the Executive be obligated to seek other
employment or take any other action by way of mitigation of the amounts payable
to the Executive under any of the provisions of this Agreement. The Company
agrees to pay, to the full extent permitted by law, all legal fees and expenses,
as incurred by the Company, the Executive and others, which the Executive may
reasonably incur as a result of any contest (regardless of the outcome thereof)
by the Company or others of the validity or enforceability of, or liability
under, any provision of this Agreement or any guarantee of performance thereof
(including as a result of any contest by the Executive about the amount of any
payment pursuant to Section 9 of this Agreement), plus in each case interest at
the applicable Federal rate provided for in Section 7872(f)(2) of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").

                  9.       CERTAIN ADDITIONAL PAYMENTS BY THE COMPANY.

                           (a)      Anything in this Agreement to the contrary
                  notwithstanding, in the event it shall be determined that any
                  payment or distribution by the Company, any individual or
                  entity whose actions result in a Change of Control, or their
                  respective subsidiaries or affiliates to or for the benefit of
                  the Executive (whether paid or payable or distributed or
                  distributable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or
                  otherwise, but determined without regard to any additional
                  payments required under this Section 9, including, but not
                  limited to, any amounts in respect of (i) options to acquire
                  shares of Company common stock and (ii) restricted shares of
                  Company common stock (a "Payment"), would be subject to the
                  excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code or any interest
                  or penalties with respect to such excise tax (such excise tax,
                  together with any such interest and penalties, are hereinafter
                  collectively referred to as the "Excise Tax"), then the
                  Executive shall be entitled to receive an additional payment
                  (a "Gross-Up Payment") from the Company in an amount such that
                  after payment by the Executive of all taxes (including any
                  interest or penalties imposed with respect to such taxes),
                  including, without limitation, any income taxes, employment
                  taxes (and any interest and penalties imposed with respect
                  thereto) and Excise Tax, imposed upon the Gross-Up Payment,
                  the Executive retains, after taking into account the phase out
                  of itemized deductions and personal exemptions attributable to
                  such Gross-Up Payment, an amount of the Gross-Up Payment equal
                  to the Excise Tax imposed upon Payments.

                           (b)      Subject to the provisions of Section 9(c),
                  all determinations required to be made under this Section 9,
                  including whether a Gross-Up Payment is required and the
                  amount of such Gross-Up Payment, shall be made by the firm of
                  independent public accountants selected by the Company (which
                  firm shall not audit the Company's financial statements) (the
                  "Accounting Firm") which shall provide detailed supporting
                  calculations both to the Company and the Executive within 30
                  business days of the Date of Termination, or such earlier time
                  as is requested by the Company. In the event that the
                  Accounting Firm is serving as accountant or auditor for the
                  individual, entity or company effecting the Change of Control,
                  the Executive shall appoint another nationally recognized
                  accounting firm to make the determinations required hereunder
                  (which accounting firm shall then be referred to as the
                  Accounting Firm hereunder). All fees and expenses of the
                  Accounting Firm shall be borne solely by the Company. Any
                  Gross- Up Payment, as determined pursuant to this Section 9,
                  shall be paid to the Executive upon the receipt of the
                  Accounting Firm's determination. If the Accounting Firm
                  determines that no Excise Tax is payable by the Executive, it
                  shall furnish the Executive with a written opinion that
                  failure to report the Excise Tax on the Executive's applicable
                  federal income tax return would not result in the imposition
                  of a negligence or a similar penalty. Any determination by the
                  Accounting Firm shall be binding upon the Company and the
                  Executive. As a result of the uncertainty in the application
                  of Section 4999 of the Code at the time of the initial
                  determination by the Accounting Firm hereunder, it is possible
                  that Gross-up Payments which will not have been made by the
                  Company should have been made ("Underpayment"), consistent
                  with the calculations required to be made hereunder. In the
                  event that the Company exhausts its remedies pursuant to
                  Section 9(c) and the

                                       12

<PAGE>

                  Executive thereafter is required to make a payment of any
                  Excise Tax, the Accounting Firm shall determine the amount of
                  the Underpayment that has occurred and any such Underpayment
                  shall be promptly paid by the Company to or for the benefit of
                  the Executive.

                           (c)      The Executive shall notify the Company in
                  writing of any claim by the Internal Revenue Service that, if
                  successful, would require the payment by the Company of the
                  Gross- Up Payment. Such notification shall be given as soon as
                  practicable but no later than ten business days after the
                  Executive knows of such claim and shall apprise the Company of
                  the nature of such claim and the date on which such claim is
                  requested to be paid. The Executive shall not pay such claim
                  prior to the expiration of the thirty-day period following the
                  date on which it gives such notice to the Company (or such
                  shorter period ending on the date that any payment of taxes
                  with respect to such claim is due). If the Company notifies
                  the Executive in writing prior to the expiration of such
                  period that it desires to contest such claim, the Executive
                  shall:

                                    (i)      give the Company any information
                           reasonably requested by the Company relating to such
                           claim,

                                    (ii)     take such action in connection with
                           contesting such claim as the Company shall reasonably
                           request in writing from time to time, including,
                           without limitation, accepting legal representation
                           with respect to such claim by an attorney reasonably
                           selected by the Company,

                                    (iii)    cooperate with the Company in good
                           faith in order to effectively contest such claim,

                                    (iv)     permit the Company to participate
                           in any proceedings relating to such claim; provided,
                           however, that the Company shall bear and pay directly
                           all costs and expenses (including additional interest
                           and penalties) incurred in connection with such
                           contest and shall indemnify and hold the Executive
                           harmless, on an after-tax basis, for any Excise Tax
                           or income tax, including interest and penalties with
                           respect thereto, imposed as a result of such
                           representation and payment of costs and expenses.

                                    Without limitation on the foregoing
                           provisions of this Section 9(c), the Company shall
                           control all proceedings taken in connection with such
                           contest and, at its sole option, may pursue or forgo
                           any and all administrative appeals, proceedings,
                           hearings and conferences with the taxing authority in
                           respect of such claim and may, at its sole option,
                           pay such claim and direct the Executive to sue for a
                           refund or contest the claim in any permissible
                           manner, and the Executive agrees to prosecute such
                           contest to a determination before any administrative
                           tribunal, in a court of initial jurisdiction and in
                           one or more appellate courts, as the Company shall
                           determine; provided, however, that if the Company
                           pays such claim and directs the Executive to sue for
                           a refund, the Company shall indemnify

                                       13

<PAGE>

                           and hold the Executive harmless, on an after-tax
                           basis, from any Excise Tax or income tax, including
                           interest or penalties with respect thereto, imposed
                           with respect to such payment; and further provided
                           that any extension of the statute of limitations
                           relating to payment of taxes for the taxable year of
                           the Executive with respect to which such contested
                           amount is claimed to be due is limited solely to such
                           contested amount. Furthermore, the Company's control
                           of the contest shall be limited to issues with
                           respect to which a Gross-Up Payment would be payable
                           hereunder and the Executive shall be entitled to
                           settle or contest, as the case may be, any other
                           issue raised by the Internal Revenue Service or any
                           other taxing authority.

                           (d)      If, after the receipt by the Executive of an
                  amount paid by the Company pursuant to Section 9(c), the
                  Executive becomes entitled to receive any refund with respect
                  to such claim, the Executive shall (subject to the Company's
                  complying with the requirements of Section 9(c)) promptly pay
                  to the Company the amount of such refund (together with any
                  interest paid or credited thereon after taxes applicable
                  thereto). If, after the receipt by the Executive of an amount
                  paid by the Company pursuant to Section 9(c), a determination
                  is made that the Executive shall not be entitled to any refund
                  with respect to such claim, and the Company does not notify
                  the Executive in writing of its intent to contest such denial
                  of refund prior to the expiration of thirty days after such
                  determination, then Executive shall be under no obligation to
                  repay such amount and the amount of such payment shall offset,
                  to the extent thereof, the amount of Gross-Up Payment required
                  to be paid.

                  10.      CERTAIN COVENANTS OF EXECUTIVE.

                           (a)      As used in Section 10 and Section 11, the
                  Company shall include the Company and each corporation,
                  partnership, or other entity that controls the Company, is
                  controlled by the Company, or is under common control with the
                  Company (in each case "control" meaning the direct or indirect
                  ownership of 50% or more of all outstanding equity interests).

                           (b)      While Executive is employed by the Company
                  and, following the termination of the Executive 's employment
                  for any reason, until the first anniversary of the Date of
                  Termination, Executive will not, directly or indirectly:

                                    (i)      employ or attempt to employ any
                           director, officer, or employee of the Company, or
                           otherwise interfere with or disrupt any employment
                           relationship (contractual or other) of the Company;

                                    (ii)     solicit, request, advise, or induce
                           any present or potential customer, supplier, or other
                           business contact of the Company to cancel, curtail,
                           or otherwise change its relationship with the
                           Company; or

                                       14

<PAGE>

                                    (iii)    publicly criticize or disparage in
                           any manner or by any means the Company or its
                           management, policies, operations, products, services,
                           practices, or personnel.

                           (c)      Executive hereby acknowledges and agrees
                  that all non-public information and data of the Company,
                  including without limitation that related to product and
                  service formulation, customers, pricing, sales, and financial
                  results (collectively, "Trade Secrets") are of substantial
                  value to the Company, provide it with a substantial
                  competitive advantage in its business, and are and have been
                  maintained in the strictest confidence as trade secrets.
                  Except as permitted by the Board, or as appropriate in the
                  performance of Executive's duties in the normal course of
                  business, Executive shall not at any time disclose or make
                  accessible to anyone any Trade Secrets.

                           (d)      Executive acknowledges and agrees that this
                  Section 10 and each provision hereof are reasonable and
                  necessary to ensure that the Company receives the expected
                  benefits of this Agreement and that violation of this Section
                  10 will harm the Company to such an extent that monetary
                  damages alone would be an inadequate remedy. Consequently, in
                  the event of any violation or threatened violation by
                  Executive of any provision of this Section 10, the Company
                  shall be entitled to an injunction (in addition to all other
                  remedies it may have) restraining Executive from committing or
                  continuing such violation. If any provision or application of
                  this Section 10 is held unlawful or unenforceable in any
                  respect, this Section 10 shall be revised or applied in a
                  manner that renders it lawful and enforceable to the fullest
                  extent possible.

                           (e)      Upon termination of Executive's employment
                  for any reason, Executive covenants to resign from the Board

                  Executive's employment (whether or not developed by Executive)
                  to identify the Company's products or services (collectively,
                  the "Marks") and all other materials, ideas, or other property
                  conceived, created, developed, adopted, or improved by

                  its designee) to file and prosecute such registration
                  applications and other documents it deems useful to protect
                  its rights under this Agreement. Any idea, copyrightable

                  12.      SUCCESSORS.

                           (a)      This Agreement is personal to the Executive
                  and without the prior written consent of the Company shall not
                  be assignable by the Executive otherwise than by will or the
                  laws of descent and distribution. This Agreement shall inure
                  to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Executive's legal
                  representatives.

                  respective successors and assigns.

                  (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger,
                  consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of its
                  business and/or assets to assume expressly and agree to
                  perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same
                  extent that the Company would be required to perform it if no
                  such succession had taken place. As used in this Agreement,
                  "Company" shall mean as hereinbefore defined and any successor
                  to its business and/or assets as aforesaid which assumes and
                  agrees to perform this Agreement by operation of law, or
                  otherwise.

                                RELEASE AGREEMENT

         Computer Network Technology Corporation (the "Company") and Gregory T.
Barnum ("Executive") agree as follows:

         WHEREAS, the Company and Executive are parties to that certain
Employment Agreement dated ______ (the "Employment Agreement"); and

         WHEREAS, the Company and Executive have agreed to terminate the
Employment Agreement releasing each other from all further obligations except
those specifically identified therein as surviving such termination.

         THEREFORE, in consideration of the covenants and obligations set forth
below, the Company and Executive agree as follows:

         1.       Separation from Employment. Executive's employment with the
Company will terminate on _________________.

         2.       Severance. The Company agrees to pay Executive severance
benefits in accordance with the terms of the Employment Agreement commencing as
soon as practicable following the expiration of the rescission period referred
to below.

         3.       Release of Claims. After adequate opportunity to review this
Release Agreement and to obtain the advice of legal counsel of Executive's
choice, Executive hereby releases, acquits and forever discharges the Company,
and all of its directors, officers, agents, employees, affiliates, parents,
successors and assigns, from any and all liability whatsoever arising from or
relating to (i) his employment by the Company, (ii) his separation from
employment with the Company, or (iii) any other claim or liability, excluding
liabilities from claims arising under this Release Agreement or under Sections
6(d) and 9 of the Employment Agreement. Subject to the foregoing, by this
Release, Executive gives up any right to make a claim, bring a lawsuit, or
otherwise seek money damages or court orders as a result of his employment by
the Company, his separation from employment with the Company, or otherwise.
Executive hereby acknowledges and intends that this Release applies to any
statutory or common law claims which have arisen through the date of Executive's
signature below, including but not limited to, any and all claims of unpaid
wages, stock options, wrongful termination, defamation, intentional or negligent
infliction of emotional distress, negligence, breach of contract, fraud, and any
claims under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), Title VII of the
Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Minnesota
Human Rights Act (MHRA), the Family and Medical Leave Act, the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act, and any other local, state or federal statutes.
Executive acknowledges that this Release includes all claims Executive is
legally permitted to release and as such does not apply to any claim for
reemployment benefits, nor does it preclude Executive from filing a charge of
discrimination with the state Department of Human Rights or the federal Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission although Executive would not be able

                                       20

<PAGE>

to recover any damages if Executive filed such a charge. This Release includes
but is not limited to all claims relating to Executive's employment and the
separation of Executive's employment. This Release Agreement shall be binding
upon Executive and upon his heirs, administrators, representatives, executors,
successors and assigns. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, in no event shall this Release Agreement constitute a release by the
Executive of his rights with respect to accrued benefits to which he would
otherwise be entitled under any of the Company's employee benefit plans,
programs or other employee benefit arrangements (excluding any severance plans
or arrangements).

         4.       Entire Agreement. This Release Agreement contains the entire
agreement between Executive and the Company with respect to the subject matter
hereof. No modification or amendment to this Release Agreement shall be valid or
binding unless made in writing and signed by the parties. This Release Agreement
will be interpreted under the laws of Minnesota.

         5.       Notification of Rescission Rights.

                  a)       This Release Agreement contains a release of certain
         legal rights which Executive may have under the ADEA or the MHRA.
         Executive should consult with an attorney regarding such release and
         other aspects of this Release Agreement before signing.

                  b)       The termination of Executive's employment by the
         Company will not be affected by Executive's acceptance or failure to
         accept this Release Agreement. If Executive does not accept the terms
         hereof, or if Executive revokes his acceptance of this Release
         Agreement, the Company will not provide to him the benefits described
         herein.

                  c)       Executive has twenty-one (21) days to consider
         whether or not to sign this agreement, starting from the date he first
         receives a copy of this agreement. Executive may sign this agreement at
         any time during this twenty-one (21) day period.

                  d)       After Executive has accepted this Release Agreement
         by signing it, he may revoke his acceptance for a period of fifteen
         (15) days after the date he signed this Release Agreement. This Release
         Agreement will not be effective until this fifteen (15) day revocation
         period has expired.

                  e)       If Executive wishes to revoke his acceptance of this
         Release Agreement he must notify the Company in writing within the
         fifteen (15) day revocation period. Such notice must be delivered to
         the Company in person or mailed by certified mail, return receipt
         requested, addressed to: Computer Network Technology Corporation, 6000
         Nathan Lane North, Plymouth, MN 55442, Attention: Board of Directors).
         If Executive fails to properly deliver or mail such written revocation
         as instructed, the revocation will not be effective.

Minnesota Statutes Annotated Section 181.78 provides as follows:

         Subdivision 1. Any provision in an employment agreement that provides
that an employee shall assign or offer to assign any of the employee's rights in
an invention to the employer shall not apply to an invention for which no
equipment, supplies, facility or trade secret information of the employer was
used and that was developed entirely on the employee's own time, and

         (1)      that does not relate (a) directly to the business of the
employer or (b) to the actual or demonstrably anticipated research or
development, or

         (2)      that does not result from any work performed by the employee
for the employer. Any provision that purports to apply to such an invention is
to that extent against the public policy of this state and is to that extent
unenforceable.

         Subdivision 2. No employer shall require a provision made void and
unenforceable by subdivision 1 as a condition of employment or continuing
employment.
