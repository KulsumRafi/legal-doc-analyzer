         evidenced to the Administrative Agent by filing with the
         Administrative Agent a resolution of the Board of Directors of HCC
         giving effect to such designation and an officer's certificate
         certifying that such designation complies with the foregoing conditions

         resolution of the Board of Directors). The Board of Directors may
         designate any Unrestricted Subsidiary as a Subsidiary; provided (i)

         becomes a Subsidiary. Unrestricted Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be
         Affiliates of Holdings, HCC and their Subsidiaries. Any Subsidiary of
         an Unrestricted Subsidiary shall also be deemed to be an Unrestricted
         Subsidiary. Any Subsidiary of Holdings that is not an Unrestricted
         Subsidiary shall be a "Restricted Subsidiary".

      have made a Material Acquisition, Consolidated EBITDA for such period
      shall be calculated after giving pro forma effect to such Material
      Acquisition as if such Material Acquisition had occurred on the first day

                  For purposes of clarification, the obligations with respect to
          the Equipment Leases shall not be deemed to constitute Indebtedness
          under the preceding clause (d) solely by virtue of the grant by HCC
          thereunder of a Lien and its interest in the Equipment subject to such
          Equipment Lease to secure HCC's and the Guarantor's obligations in
          connection therewith.

      or other obligations of such Unrestricted Subsidiary (including any
      undertaking, agreement or instrument evidencing such Indebtedness or
      obligations) except as permitted by subsection 11.10 and (b) any
      Investment by HCC or the Restricted Subsidiaries in such Unrestricted
      Subsidiary made as a result of designating such subsidiary an Unrestricted
      Subsidiary shall not violate the provisions described under subsection
      11.10 and such Unrestricted Subsidiary is not party to any agreement,
      contract, arrangement or understanding at such time with HCC or any other
      Subsidiary (other than another Unrestricted Subsidiary) of HCC unless the
      terms of any such agreement, contract, arrangement or understanding are no
      less favorable to HCC or such other Subsidiary than those that might be
      obtained at the time from Persons who are not Affiliates of HCC or, in the
      event such condition is not satisfied, the value of such agreement,
      contract, arrangement or understanding to such Unrestricted Subsidiary
      shall be deemed an Investment. Any such designation by the Board of
      Directors shall be evidenced to the Administrative Agent by filing with
      the Administrative Agent a resolution of the Board of Directors of HCC
      giving effect to such designation and an officer's certificate certifying
      that such designation complies with the foregoing conditions and any
      Investment by HCC in such Unrestricted Subsidiary shall be deemed the

      Investment as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors (and
      evidenced by a resolution of the Board of Directors). The Board of
      Directors may designate any Unrestricted Subsidiary as a Subsidiary;
      provided (i) that, if such Unrestricted Subsidiary has any Indebtedness,
      immediately after giving effect to such designation, no Default or Event
      of Default would result, and (ii) that all Indebtedness of such Subsidiary
      shall be deemed to be incurred on the date such Unrestricted Subsidiary
      becomes a Subsidiary. Unrestricted Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be
      Affiliates of Holdings, HCC and their Subsidiaries. Any Subsidiary of an
      Unrestricted Subsidiary shall also be deemed to be an Unrestricted
      Subsidiary. Any Subsidiary of Holdings that is not an Unrestricted
      Subsidiary shall be a "Restricted Subsidiary".

          4.   Amendment to Section 2 of the Senior Credit Agreement. Section 2
of the Senior Credit Agreement is amended by adding the following new subsection
2.3:

               2.3 Increase of Commitments. (a) HCC shall have the right to
          increase the Commitments from time to time pursuant to this subsection
          2.3 by up to $200,000,000 in the aggregate as long as no Default or
          Event of Default has occurred and is continuing. In the event that HCC
          wishes to increase the aggregate Commitments at any time, it shall
          notify the Administrative Agent in writing of the amount (the "Offered
          Increase Amount") of such proposed increase (such notice, a
          "Commitment Increase Notice"); provided that the aggregate amount of
          any such increase in Commitments shall be at least $10,000,000. HCC
          may, at its election, (i) offer one or more of the Lenders the
          opportunity to participate in all or a portion of the Offered Increase
          Amount pursuant to paragraph (c) below and/or (ii) with the consent of
          the Administrative Agent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
          withheld), offer one or more additional banks, financial institutions
          or other entities the opportunity to participate in all or a portion
          of the Offered Increase Amount pursuant to paragraph (b) below. Each
          Commitment Increase Notice shall specify which Lenders and/or banks,
          financial institutions or other entities HCC desires to participate in
          such Commitment increase. HCC or, if requested by HCC, the
          Administrative Agent, will notify such Lenders and/or banks, financial
          institutions or other entities of such offer.

               (b) Any additional bank, financial institution or other entity
          which HCC selects to offer participation in the increased Commitments
          and which elects to become a party to this Agreement and provide a
          Commitment in an amount so offered and accepted by it pursuant to
          subsection 2.3(a)(ii) shall execute a New Lender Supplement (in the
          form specified by the Administrative Agent) with HCC and the
          Administrative Agent, whereupon such bank, financial institution or
          other entity (herein called a "New Lender") shall become a Lender for
          all purposes and to the same extent as if originally a party hereto
          and shall be bound by and entitled to the benefits of this Agreement,
          and Schedule 1.1A shall be deemed to be amended to add the name and
          Commitment of such New Lender, provided that the Commitment of any
          such new Lender shall be in an amount not less than $5,000,000,
          provided further that on the effective date of such New Lender
          Supplement, there shall be no outstanding Eurodollar Loans hereunder
          or, if any Eurodollar Loans would be outstanding on the effective date
          of any such New Lender

<PAGE>

                                                                               9

          Supplement, HCC shall either (x) convert such Eurodollar Loans to ABR
          Loans, or (y) prepay, in accordance with the provisions of Section
          3,4, such Eurodollar Loans immediately prior to such New Lender
          Supplement becoming effective (subject, in either case, to the payment
          provisions hereof).

               (c) Any Lender which accepts an offer to it by HCC to increase
          its Commitment pursuant to subsection 2.3(a)(ii) shall, in each case,
          execute a Commitment Increase Supplement (in the form specified by the
          Administrative Agent) with HCC and the Administrative Agent whereupon
          such Lender shall be bound by and entitled to the benefits of this
          Agreement with respect to the full amount of its Commitment as so
          increased, and Schedule 1.1A shall be deemed to be amended to so
          increase the Commitment of such Lender.

               (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this subsection
          2.3(i) in no event shall any transaction effected pursuant to this
          subsection 2.3 cause the aggregate Commitments hereunder to exceed
          $400,000,000 and (ii) no Lender shall have any obligation to increase
          its Commitment unless it agrees to do so in its sole discretion.
