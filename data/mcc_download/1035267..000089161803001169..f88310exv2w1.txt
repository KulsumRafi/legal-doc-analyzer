                                   ARTICLE 1.
                                   THE MERGER

      Section 1.1 The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the
DGCL, Merger Sub, at the Effective Time, shall be merged with and into the
Company. As a result of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of Merger
Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation of

      Section 1.2 Effective Time. As soon as practicable after the satisfaction
or, if permissible, waiver of the conditions set forth in Article 6, the parties
hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing a certificate of
merger (the "Certificate of Merger") with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware, in such form as required by, and executed in accordance with the
relevant provisions of, the DGCL (the date and time of such filing, or if
another date and time is specified in such filing, such specified date and time,
being the "Effective Time").

      Section 1.3 Effect of the Merger. At the Effective Time, the effect of the
Merger shall be as provided in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, at the Effective Time, except as
otherwise provided herein, all the property, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving
Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub
shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

      Section 1.4 Certificate of Incorporation; By-laws. At the Effective Time,
the Certificate of Incorporation and the By-laws of the Surviving Corporation
shall be amended in their entirety to contain the provisions set forth in the
Certificate of Incorporation and the By-laws of Merger Sub, each as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, as the same may be amended in
accordance with Section 5.13.1 hereof.

      Section 1.5 Directors and Officers. The directors of Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the
Surviving Corporation, each to


                                       2
<PAGE>
hold office in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of
the Surviving Corporation. The officers of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation, each
to hold office in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws
of the Surviving Corporation.

                                   ARTICLE 2.
               CONVERSION OF SECURITIES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

      Section 2.1 Conversion of Securities. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Merger Sub, the Company or the
holders of any of the following securities:

            Section 2.1.1 Conversion Generally.

                  Section 2.1.1.1 Company Common Stock. Each share of common
stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company ("Company Common Stock")
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any
shares of Company Common Stock to be canceled pursuant to Section 2.1.2),
including the associated rights of the Company (the "Company Rights") pursuant
to the Rights Agreement, dated as of June 14, 1999, between the Company and
American Stock Transfer and Trust Company, as Rights Agent (the "Company Rights
Agreement") shall be converted, subject to Section 2.2.5, into the right to
receive a number of shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of
Parent ("Parent Common Stock"), equal to the Exchange Ratio. All such shares of
Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each certificate previously
representing any such shares shall thereafter represent the right to receive a
certificate representing the shares of Parent Common Stock into which such
Company Common Stock was converted in the Merger. Certificates previously
representing shares of Company Common Stock shall be exchanged for certificates
representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in consideration
therefor upon the surrender of such certificates in accordance with the
provisions of Section 2.2, without interest. No fractional share of Parent
Common Stock shall be issued, and in lieu thereof, a cash payment shall be made
pursuant to Section 2.2.5 hereof.

                  Section 2.1.1.2 Company Preferred Stock. Each share of
preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company (the "Company
Preferred Stock" and, together


                                       3
<PAGE>
with the Company Common Stock, the "Company Stock") issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any shares of Company
Preferred Stock to be canceled pursuant to Section 2.1.2), shall be converted,
subject to Section 2.2.5, into the right to receive a number of shares of Parent
Common Stock equal to that number of shares of Company Common Stock into which
the Company Preferred Stock would have been convertible multiplied by the
Exchange Ratio. All such shares of Company Preferred Stock shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to
exist, and each certificate previously representing any such shares shall
thereafter represent the right to receive a certificate representing the shares
of Parent Common Stock into which such Company Preferred Stock was converted in
the Merger. Certificates previously representing shares of Company Preferred
Stock shall be exchanged for certificates representing whole shares of Parent
Common Stock issued in consideration therefor upon the surrender of such
certificates in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.2, without interest.
No fractional share of Parent Common Stock shall be issued, and in lieu thereof,
a cash payment shall be made pursuant to Section 2.2.5 hereof.

                  Section 2.1.1.3 Warrants. At the Effective Time, all
unexercised and unexpired warrants to purchase Company Common Stock ("Company
Warrants") then outstanding will be assumed by Parent. Each Company Warrant so
assumed by Parent under this Agreement will continue to have, and be subject to,
the same terms and conditions as set forth in such Company Warrant and any
agreements executed in connection therewith immediately prior to the Effective
Time, except that (i) each Company Warrant will be exercisable (or will become
exercisable in accordance with its terms) for that number of whole shares of
Parent Common Stock equal to the product of the number of shares of Company
Common Stock that were issuable upon exercise of such Company Warrant
immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio,
rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock and
(ii) the per share exercise price for the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable
upon exercise of such Company Warrant assumed, will be equal to the quotient
determined by dividing the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock at
which such Company Warrant was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective
Time by the Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent.

            Section 2.1.2 Cancellation of Certain Shares. Each share of Company
Stock held by Parent, Merger Sub, any wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent or
Merger Sub, in the


                                       4
<PAGE>
treasury of the Company or by any wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and extinguished
without any conversion thereof and no payment shall be made with respect
thereto.

            Section 2.1.3 Merger Sub. Each share of common stock, par value
$0.001 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into and be exchanged for one newly and
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation.

            Section 2.1.4 Change in Shares. If between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock
or Company Stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a
different class, by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification,
recapitalization, split, combination or exchange of shares, the Exchange Ratio
shall be correspondingly adjusted to reflect such stock dividend, subdivision,
reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination or exchange of shares.

      Section 2.2 Exchange of Certificates.

            Section 2.2.1 Exchange Agent. As of the Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with Computer Share, Inc. or another
bank or trust company designated by Parent and reasonably satisfactory to the
Company (the "Exchange Agent"), for the benefit of the holders of shares of
Company Stock, for exchange in accordance with this Article 2, through the
Exchange Agent, certificates representing the shares of Parent Common Stock
(such certificates for shares of Parent Common Stock, together with cash in lieu
of fractional shares and any dividends or distributions with respect thereto,
being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund") issuable pursuant to
Section 2.1 in exchange for outstanding shares of Company Stock. The Exchange
Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the Parent Common
Stock contemplated to be issued pursuant to Section 2.1 out of the Exchange
Fund. Except as contemplated by Section 2.2.5 hereof, the Exchange Fund shall
not be used for any other purpose.

            Section 2.2.2 Exchange Procedures. Promptly after the Effective
Time, Parent shall instruct the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record
of a certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding shares of Company Stock (the "Certificates") (A) a
letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery


                                       5
<PAGE>
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass,
only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be
in customary form) and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Certificates in exchange for certificates representing shares of Parent
Common Stock. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange
Agent together with such letter of transmittal, properly completed and duly
executed, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such
instructions, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor a certificate representing that number of whole shares of
Parent Common Stock which such holder has the right to receive in respect of the
shares of Company Stock formerly represented by such Certificate (after taking
into account all shares of Company Stock then held by such holder), cash in lieu
of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to Section 2.2.5 and any dividends or other distributions to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2.3, and the Certificate so surrendered
shall forthwith be canceled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any cash in
lieu of fractional shares or on any unpaid dividends and distributions payable
to holders of Certificates. In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of
Company Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, a
certificate representing the proper number of shares of Parent Common Stock may
be issued to a transferee if the Certificate representing such shares of Company
Stock is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required
to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock
transfer taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section
2.2, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the certificate
representing shares of Parent Common Stock, cash in lieu of any fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
Section 2.2.5 and any dividends or other distributions to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to Section 2.2.3.

            Section 2.2.3 Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares of
Parent Common Stock. No dividends or other distributions declared or made after
the Effective Time with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after
the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate
with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock represented thereby, and no
cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder
pursuant to Section 2.2.5, unless and until the holder of such Certificate shall


                                       6
<PAGE>
surrender such Certificate. Subject to the effect of escheat, tax or other
applicable Laws, following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be
paid to the holder of the certificates representing whole shares of Parent
Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (A) promptly, the
amount of any cash payable with respect to a fractional share of Parent Common
Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2.5 and the amount
of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock and
(B) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other
distributions, with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to
surrender and a payment date occurring after surrender, payable with respect to
such whole shares of Parent Common Stock.

            Section 2.2.4 Further Rights in Company Stock. All shares of Parent
Common Stock issued upon conversion of the shares of Company Stock in accordance
with the terms hereof (including any cash paid pursuant to Section 2.2.3 or
Section 2.2.5) shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to such shares of Company Stock.

            Section 2.2.5 Fractional Shares. No certificates or scrip
representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the
surrender for exchange of Certificates, no dividend or distribution with respect
to Parent Common Stock shall be payable on or with respect to any fractional
share and such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to
any rights of a stockholder of Parent.

                  Section 2.2.5.1 As promptly as practicable following the
Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall determine the difference between (A)
the number of full shares of Parent Common Stock delivered to the Exchange Agent
by Parent pursuant to Section 2.2.1 and (B) the aggregate number of full shares
of Parent Common Stock to be distributed to holders of Company Stock pursuant to
Section 2.2.2 (such difference being the "Excess Shares"). As soon after the
Effective Time as practicable, the Exchange Agent, as agent for such holders of
Parent Common Stock, shall sell the Excess Shares at then prevailing prices on
Nasdaq, all in the manner provided in this Section 2.2.5.

                  Section 2.2.5.2 The sale of the Excess Shares by the Exchange
Agent shall be executed on Nasdaq and shall be executed in round lots to the
extent practicable. Until the net proceeds of any such sale or sales have been
distributed to such holders of


                                       7
<PAGE>
Company Stock, the Exchange Agent will hold such proceeds in trust for such
holders of Company Stock as part of the Exchange Fund. The Company shall pay all
commissions, transfer taxes and other out-of-pocket transaction costs of the
Exchange Agent incurred in connection with such sale or sales of Excess Shares.
In addition, the Company shall pay the Exchange Agent's compensation and
expenses in connection with such sale or sales. The Exchange Agent shall
determine the portion of such net proceeds to which each holder of Company Stock
shall be entitled, if any, by multiplying the amount of the aggregate net
proceeds by a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of the fractional
share interest to which such holder of Company Stock is entitled (after taking
into account all shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued to such holder) and
the denominator of which is the aggregate amount of fractional share interests
to which all holders of Company Stock are entitled.

                  Section 2.2.5.3 As soon as practicable after the determination
of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of Company Stock with
respect to any fractional share interests, the Exchange Agent shall promptly pay
such amounts to such holders of Company Stock subject to and in accordance with
the terms of Section 2.2.3.

            Section 2.2.6 Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the
Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the holders of Company Stock for
six months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent upon demand,
and any holders of Company Stock who have not theretofore complied with this
Article 2 shall thereafter look only to Parent for the shares of Parent Common
Stock, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which
they are entitled pursuant to Section 2.2.5 and any dividends or other
distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock to which they are entitled
pursuant to Section 2.2.3, in each case, without any interest thereon.

            Section 2.2.7 No Liability. Neither Parent nor the Company shall be
liable to any holder of shares of Company Stock for any such shares of Parent
Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or cash from
the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law.

            Section 2.2.8 Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Parent, the posting by such person of


                                       8
<PAGE>
a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange
Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
shares of Parent Common Stock, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 2.2.5
and any dividends or other distributions to which the holders thereof are
entitled pursuant to Section 2.2.3, in each case, without any interest thereon.

            Section 2.2.9 Withholding. Parent or the Exchange Agent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Company Stock such amounts as Parent
or the Exchange Agent are required to deduct and withhold under the Code, or any
provision of state, local or foreign tax Law, with respect to the making of such
payment. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent or the Exchange
Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement
as having been paid to the holder of Company Stock in respect of whom such
deduction and withholding was made by Parent or the Exchange Agent.

      Section 2.3 Stock Transfer Books. At the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter, there shall be no
further registration of transfers of shares of Company Stock theretofore
outstanding on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time,
the holders of certificates representing shares of Company Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with
respect to such shares of Company Stock except as otherwise provided herein or
by Law. On or after the Effective Time, any Certificates presented to the
Exchange Agent or Parent for any reason shall be converted into the shares of
Parent Common Stock, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 2.2.5 and
any dividends or other distributions to which the holders thereof are entitled
pursuant to Section 2.2.3.

      Section 2.4 Stock Options. At the Effective Time, all unexercised and
unexpired options to purchase Company Common Stock ("Company Options") then
outstanding, under any stock option plan of the Company, including the Company's
Tandem Stock Option Plan, the Company's 1997 Stock Incentive Plan or any other
plan, agreement or arrangement (the "Company Stock Option Plans"), whether or
not then exercisable, will be assumed by Parent.


                                       9
<PAGE>
Each Company Option so assumed by Parent under this Agreement will continue to
have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions as set forth in the
Company Stock Option Plan and any agreements thereunder immediately prior to the
Effective Time, except that (i) each Company Option will be exercisable (or will
become exercisable in accordance with its terms) for that number of whole shares
of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of the number of shares of Company
Common Stock that were issuable upon exercise of such Company Option immediately
prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to
the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock and (ii) the per share
exercise price for the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of
such Company Option assumed, will be equal to the quotient determined by
dividing the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock at which such
Company Option was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time by the
Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent. The conversion of any
Company Options which are incentive stock options within the meaning of Section
422 of the Code, into options to purchase Parent Common Stock shall be made so
as not to constitute a "modification" of such Company Options within the meaning
of Section 424 of the Code. Continuous employment with the Company or its
subsidiaries shall be credited to the optionee for purposes of determining the
vesting of all assumed Company Options after the Effective Time.

                                   ARTICLE 3.
                  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

      Except as set forth in the Disclosure Schedule delivered by the Company to
Parent prior to the execution of this Agreement (the "Company Disclosure
Schedule"), which identifies exceptions by specific Section references, the
Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent as follows:

      Section 3.1 Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries. The Company is a
corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws
of the State of Delaware. Each subsidiary of the Company (each a "Company
Subsidiary" and, collectively, the "Company Subsidiaries") has been duly
organized, and is validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization, as the case may be. Each of
the Company and each Company Subsidiary has the requisite power and authority
and all necessary governmental approvals to own, lease and operate its
properties and to carry on its


                                       10
<PAGE>
business as it is now being conducted. Each of the Company and each Company
Subsidiary is duly qualified or licensed to do business, and is in good
standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of the properties owned,
leased or operated by it or the nature of its business makes such qualification,
licensing or good standing necessary, except for such failures to be so
qualified, licensed or in good standing that would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.
Section 3.1 of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and complete
list of all of the Company Subsidiaries. Except as set forth in Section 3.1 of
the Company Disclosure Schedule, none of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
holds an Equity Interest in any other person.

      Section 3.2 Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws; Corporate Books and
Records. The copies of the Company's Second Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation (the "Company Certificate") and By-laws (the "Company By-laws")

December 31, 2001 are complete and correct copies thereof as in effect on the
date hereof (the "Company Form 10-K"). The Company is not in violation of any of
the provisions of the Company Certificate or the Company By-laws. True and
complete copies of all minute books of the Company have been made available by
the Company to Parent.

      Section 3.3 Capitalization. The authorized capital stock of the Company
consists of 50,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock and 5,000,000 shares of
Company Preferred Stock. As of the date hereof, (A)17,842,157 shares of Company
Common Stock (other than treasury shares) were issued and outstanding, all of
which were validly issued and fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive
rights, (B) no shares of Company Common Stock were held in the treasury of the
Company or by the Company Subsidiaries, and (C) 5,537,142 shares of Company
Common Stock were issuable (and such number was reserved for issuance) upon
exercise of Company Options outstanding as of such date. As of the date hereof,
of the 5,000,000 shares of authorized Company Preferred Stock, 12,000 shares
have been designated as Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock; 12,000
shares have been designated as Series B Convertible Preferred Stock; 10,750

8,965 shares of which have been designated as Series D-1 Convertible Preferred
Stock ("Series D-1 Convertible Preferred Stock") and 1,785 shares of which have

Convertible Preferred Stock and 1,071 shares of Series D-2 Convertible Preferred
Stock are issued and outstanding, and there are no other shares of Company
Preferred Stock outstanding. Except for Company Options to purchase not more
than 5,537,142 shares of Company Common Stock and Company Warrants to purchase
not more than 7,416,887 shares of Company Common Stock outstanding as of the
date hereof, Company Rights outstanding under the Company Rights Agreement and
arrangements and agreements set forth in Section 3.3 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, there are no options, warrants or other rights, agreements,
arrangements or commitments of any character to which the Company or any Company

relating to the issued or unissued capital stock or other Equity Interests of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary, or securities convertible into or
exchangeable for such capital stock or other Equity Interests, or obligating the
Company or any Company Subsidiary to issue or sell any shares of its capital

and the vesting schedule of the Company Options for each officer of the Company
and the prices at which outstanding Company Warrants may be exercised, the

Company Stock Option Plans, upon issuance prior to the Effective Time on the
terms and conditions specified in the instruments pursuant to which they are
issuable, will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully


                                       12

or any Company Subsidiary. Except as set forth in Section 3.3 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, each outstanding share of capital stock of each Company
Subsidiary is duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid, nonassessable and
free of preemptive rights and is owned, beneficially and of record, by the
Company or another Company Subsidiary free and clear of all security interests,
liens, claims, pledges, options, rights of first refusal, agreements,
limitations on the Company's or such other Company Subsidiary's voting rights,
charges and other encumbrances of any nature whatsoever. There are no
outstanding contractual obligations of the Company or any Company Subsidiary to
provide funds to, or make any investment (in the form of a loan, capital
contribution or otherwise) in, any Company Subsidiary or any other person, other

wholly-owned Company Subsidiary.

<PAGE>
each Ancillary Agreement has been duly authorized and validly executed and

terminate and the Company Rights will expire immediately prior to the Effective
Time. The Company Rights Agreement, as so amended, has not been further amended
or modified. True and complete copies of the Company Rights Agreement and of all
amendments thereto through the date hereof have been previously provided to
Parent.

      Section 3.5 No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents.

            Section 3.5.1 The execution and delivery of this Agreement and each
Ancillary Agreement by the Company does not, and the performance of this

equivalent organizational documents of any Company Subsidiary, (B) assuming that
all consents, approvals, authorizations and permits described in Section 3.5.2
have been obtained and all filings and notifications described in Section 3.5.2
have been made and any

cancellation of, or result in the creation of a lien or other encumbrance on any
property or asset of the Company or any Company Subsidiary pursuant to, any
note, bond, mortgage, indenture, contract, agreement, lease, license, Company
Permit or other instrument or obligation.

regulations of Nasdaq and the filing and recordation of the Certificate of
Merger as required by the DGCL and (B) where failure to obtain such consents,
approvals, authorizations or permits, or to make such filings or notifications
to a person other than a Governmental Entity, would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to (x) prevent or materially delay
consummation of the Merger, (y) otherwise prevent or materially delay
performance by the Company of any of its material obligations under this
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement or (z) have a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

      Section 3.6 Permits; Compliance With Law. Each of the Company and each
Company Subsidiary is in possession of all authorizations, licenses, permits,

the Company and each Company Subsidiary to own, lease and operate its properties
or to carry on its respective businesses substantially in the manner described
in the Company SEC Filings filed prior to the date hereof and substantially as

such Company Permits are valid, and in full force and effect, except where the

or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to (A) prevent or materially delay
consummation of the Merger, (B) otherwise prevent


                                       15

delay performance by the Company of any of its material obligations under this
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement or (C) have a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

statements, prospectuses, forms, reports, definitive proxy statements, schedules
and documents required to be filed by it under the Securities Act or the
Exchange Act, as the case may be, since January 1, 2000 (collectively, the
"Company SEC Filings"). Each Company SEC Filing (A) as of its date, complied in
all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act or the
Exchange Act, as the case may be, and (B) did not, at the time it was filed,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. As of the date of this Agreement, no Company Subsidiary is subject
to the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act.

            Section 3.7.2 Each of the consolidated financial statements

basis throughout the periods indicated (except as may be indicated in the notes
thereto), and each presented fairly the consolidated financial position, results
of operations and cash flows of the Company and the consolidated Company
Subsidiaries as of the respective dates thereof and for the respective periods
indicated therein (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal
year-end adjustments which did not and would not, individually or in the


                                       16
<PAGE>
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect).
The books and records of the Company and each Company Subsidiary have been, and
are being, maintained in accordance with applicable legal and accounting
requirements.

            Section 3.7.3 Except as and to the extent set forth on the
consolidated balance sheet of the Company and the consolidated Company
Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2001 included in the Company Form 10-K for the
year ended December 31, 2001, including the notes thereto, none of the Company
or any consolidated Company Subsidiary has any liabilities or obligations of any
nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise) that would be
required to be reflected on a balance sheet or in notes thereto prepared in
accordance with GAAP, except for liabilities or obligations incurred in the
ordinary course of business since December 31, 2001 that would not, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to (A) prevent or materially delay
consummation of the Merger, (B) otherwise prevent or materially delay
performance by the Company of any of its material obligations under this
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement or (C) have a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

            Section 3.7.4 The Company has previously provided to Parent a
complete and correct copy of any amendment or modification which has not yet
been filed with the SEC to any agreement, document or other instrument which

the Company Stockholders' Meeting, (E) the time of the Parent Stockholders'
Meeting, and (F) the Effective Time, will comply as to form in all material
respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange
Act and other applicable Laws.

amendments or supplements thereto, do not, and will not, at (A) the time the
Registration Statement is declared effective, (B) the time the Proxy Statement
(or any amendment thereof or


                                       17
<PAGE>
supplement thereto) is first mailed to the stockholders of the Company, (C) the

state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. The representations and warranties contained in this
Section 3.8.2 will not apply to statements or omissions included in the Proxy
Statement or any Other Filings based upon information furnished in writing to
the Company by Parent or Merger Sub specifically for use therein.

      Section 3.9 Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Since September 30,
2002, except as specifically contemplated by, or as disclosed in, this Agreement
or Section 3.9 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company and each Company
Subsidiary has conducted its businesses in the ordinary course consistent with
past practice. During the period from October 1, 2002 through the date of this
Agreement, there has not been any Company Material Adverse Effect or an event or
development that would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected
to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Since September 30, 2002, there has
not been any event or development that would, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay the performance of this
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement by the Company. Neither the Company nor any
Company Subsidiary has taken any action during the period from October 1, 2002
through the date of this Agreement that, if taken during the period from the
date of this Agreement through the Effective Time, would constitute a breach of
Section 5.1.

      Section 3.10 Employee Benefit Plans

sets forth a true and complete list of each "employee benefit plan" as defined
in Section 3(3) of ERISA and any other plan, policy, program, practice,
agreement, understanding or arrangement (whether written or oral) providing
compensation or other benefits to any current or former director, officer,
employee or consultant (or to any dependent or beneficiary thereof of the
Company or any ERISA Affiliate), which are now, or were within the past 6 years,
maintained,


                                       18
<PAGE>
sponsored or contributed to by the Company or any ERISA Affiliate, or under
which the Company or any ERISA Affiliate has any obligation or liability,
whether actual or contingent, including, without limitation, all incentive,
bonus, deferred compensation, vacation, holiday, cafeteria, medical, disability,
stock purchase, stock option, stock appreciation, phantom stock, restricted
stock or other stock-based compensation plans, policies, programs, practices or
arrangements (each a "Company Benefit Plan"). Neither the Company, nor to the
knowledge of the Company, or any other person or entity, has any express or
implied commitment, whether legally enforceable or not, to modify, change or
terminate any Company Benefit Plan, other than with respect to a modification,
change or termination required by ERISA or the Code.

      With respect to each Company Benefit Plan, the Company has delivered to
Parent true, correct and complete copies of (A) each Company Benefit Plan (or,
if not written a written summary of its material terms), including without

with past practice). Except as set forth in Section 3.11.1 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, none of the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party to
any collective bargaining or other labor union contract applicable to persons
employed by the Company or any Company Subsidiary, and no collective bargaining
agreement or other labor union contract is being negotiated by the Company or
any Company Subsidiary. There is no labor dispute, strike, slowdown or work
stoppage against the Company or any Company Subsidiary pending or, to the
knowledge of the Company, threatened which may interfere in any respect that
would have a Company Material Adverse Effect with the respective business
activities of the Company or any Company Subsidiary. No labor union or similar
organization has otherwise been certified to represent any persons employed by
the Company or any Company Subsidiary or has applied to represent such employees
or, to the knowledge of the Company, is attempting to organize so as to
represent such employees. None of the Company, any Company Subsidiary or their
respective representatives or employees has committed any unfair labor practices
in connection with the operation of the respective businesses of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary, and there is no charge or complaint against the Company
or any Company Subsidiary by the National Labor Relations Board or any
comparable state or foreign agency pending or, to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened, except where such unfair labor practice, charge or complaint would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse


                                       22
<PAGE>
Effect. None of the Company or any Company Subsidiary is delinquent in payments
to any of its employees for any wages, salaries, commissions, bonuses or other
direct compensation for any services performed for it or amounts required to be
reimbursed to such employees. Each of the Company and each Company Subsidiary
has withheld all amounts required by Law or by agreement to be withheld from the
wages, salaries, and other payments to employees, and is not liable for any
arrears of wages or any Taxes or any penalty for failure to comply with any of
the foregoing. There are no material pending claims against the Company or any
Company Subsidiary under any workers' compensation plan or policy or for long
term disability. There are no material controversies pending or, to the
knowledge of the Company, threatened, between the Company or any Company
Subsidiary and any of their current or former employees, which controversies
have or could reasonably be expected to result in an action, suit, proceeding,
claim, arbitration or investigation before any Governmental Entity. To the
Company's knowledge, no employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary is in
any material respect in violation of any term of any employment contract,
non-disclosure agreement, non-competition agreement, or any restrictive covenant
to a former employer relating to the right of any such employee to be employed
by the Company or such Company Subsidiary because of the nature of the business
conducted or presently proposed to be conducted by it or to the use of trade
secrets or proprietary information of others. No employee of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary has given notice, nor is the Company otherwise aware, that
such employee intends to terminate his or her employment with the Company or
such Company Subsidiary.

            Section 3.11.2 The Company has identified in Section 3.11.2 of the

or employees of or consultants to the Company or any Company Subsidiary, (B) all
severance programs and policies of the Company and each Company Subsidiary with
or relating to its employees, and (C) all plans, programs, agreements and other
arrangements of the Company and each Company Subsidiary with or relating to its
directors, officers, employees or consultants which contain change in control
provisions. Except as set forth in Section 3.11.2 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, none of the execution and delivery of this Agreement or any Ancillary
Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby
will (either alone or in conjunction with any other event, such as termination
of employment) (A) result in any payment


                                       23
<PAGE>
(including, without limitation, severance, unemployment compensation, parachute
or otherwise) becoming due to any director or any employee of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary or affiliate from the Company or any Company Subsidiary or
affiliate under any Company Benefit Plan or otherwise, (B) significantly
increase any benefits otherwise payable under any Company Benefit Plan or (C)
result in any acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any material
benefits. No individual who is a party to an employment agreement listed in
Section 3.11.2 of the Company Disclosure Schedule or any agreement incorporating
change in control provisions with the Company has terminated employment or been
terminated, nor has any event occurred that could give rise to a termination
event, in either case under circumstances that has given, or could give, rise to
a severance obligation on the part of the Company under such agreement. Section
3.11.2 of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth the Company's best
estimates of the amounts payable to the executives listed therein, as a result
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement,
and/or any subsequent employment termination (including any cash-out or
acceleration of options and restricted stock and any "gross-up" payments with
respect to any of the foregoing), based on compensation data applicable as of
the date of the Company Disclosure Schedule and the assumptions stated therein.

            Section 3.11.3 There are no pending or threatened claims (other than
claims for benefits in the ordinary course), lawsuits or arbitrations which have
been asserted or instituted against any Company Benefit Plan, any fiduciaries
thereof with respect to their duties to the Company Benefit Plans or the assets
of any of the trusts under any of the Company Benefit Plans which could
reasonably be expected to result in any material liability of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation ("PBGC"), the
Department of Treasury, the Department of Labor or any Multiemployer Plan.

      Section 3.12 Tax Treatment. None of the Company, any Company Subsidiary
or, to the knowledge of the Company, any of the Company's affiliates has taken
or agreed to take any action that would prevent the Merger from qualifying as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. The Company is
not aware of any agreement, plan or other circumstance that would prevent the
Merger from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a)
of the Code.

      Except as filed as exhibits to the Company SEC Filings filed prior to the
date of this Agreement, or as disclosed in Section 3.13 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, none of the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party to
or bound by any contract (A) any of the benefits to any party of which will be
increased, or the vesting of the benefits to any party of which will be
accelerated, by the occurrence of any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, or the value of any of the benefits to any
party of which will be calculated on the basis of any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, or (B) which, as of
the date hereof, (1) is a "material contract" (as such term is defined in Item
601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K of the SEC), (2) involves aggregate expenditures in
excess of $250,000, other than contracts for the purchase of raw materials,
components or manufacturing goods and contracts for the sale of the Company's

business, (4) contains any non-compete or exclusivity provisions with respect to
any line of business or geographic area with respect to the Company, any Company
Subsidiary or any of the Company's current or future affiliates, or which
restricts the conduct of any line of business by the Company, any Company
Subsidiary or any of the Company's current or future affiliates or any
geographic area in which the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any of the
Company's current or future affiliates may conduct business, in each case in any
material respect, (5) involves the sale of a Company Product to a customer or
distributor and provides for a right of refund or return for any reason,
including upon the occurrence of specified events or otherwise or (6) would
prohibit or materially delay the consummation of the Merger or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement. Each
Contract of the type described in this Section 3.13, whether or not set forth in
Section 3.13 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, is referred to herein as a
"Company Material Contract." Each Company Material Contract is valid and binding
on the Company and each Company Subsidiary party thereto and, to the Company's
knowledge, each other party thereto, and in full force and effect, and the
Company and each Company Subsidiary has in all material respects performed all
obligations required to be performed by it to the date hereof under each Company
Material Contract and, to the Company's knowledge, each other party to each
Company Material Contract


                                       25

by it under such Company Material Contract, except as would not, individually or
in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to (1) prevent or materially delay
consummation of the Merger, (2) otherwise prevent or materially delay
performance by the Company of any of its material obligations under this
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, or (3) result in a Company Material
Adverse Effect. None of the Company or any Company Subsidiary knows of, or has
received notice of, any violation or default under (or any condition which with
the passage of time or the giving of notice would cause such a violation of or
default under) any Company Material Contract or any other contract to which it
is a party or by which it or any of its properties or assets is bound, except
for violations or defaults that would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to (1) prevent or materially delay consummation of the
Merger, (2) otherwise prevent or materially delay performance by the Company of
any of its material obligations under this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement
or (3) result in a Company Material Adverse Effect. Section 3.13 of the Company

costs which will accrue to the Company under the contracts described in clause
(A) of Section 3.13 as a result of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement.

threatened in writing against the Company or any Company Subsidiary or
reasonably likely to be brought against the Company or any Company Subsidiary or

third party that (1) has had or would, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or (2) as of
the date hereof, challenges the validity or propriety, or seeks to prevent or
materially delay consummation of the Merger or any other transaction
contemplated by this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement and (B) none of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary is subject to any outstanding order, writ,
injunction, decree or arbitration ruling, award or other finding which has had
or would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to (1)
prevent or materially delay consummation of the Merger, (2) otherwise prevent or
materially delay performance by the Company of any of its


                                       26

material obligations under this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, or (3)
result in a Company Material Adverse Effect.

                                       27

Property"). Excepting the Intellectual Property owned or controlled by Parent

information or know-how; (C) the making, using, selling, manufacturing,

hereby and thereby will not breach, violate or conflict with any instrument or
agreement concerning any Material Company Intellectual Property, will not cause
the forfeiture or termination or give rise to a right of forfeiture or
termination of any of the Material Company Intellectual Property or impair the
right of Parent or the Surviving Corporation to make, use, sell, license or
dispose of, or to bring any action for the infringement of any Material Company
Intellectual Property. In addition, the matters disclosed

sponsors, contributes to or has any liability with respect to any employee
benefit plan, program or arrangement that provides benefits to non-resident
aliens with no United States source income outside of the United States.

            Section 4.10.6 Except as set forth on Section 4.10.6 of the Parent
Disclosure Schedule, no amount that could be received (whether in cash or
property or the vesting of property), as a result of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, by any
employee, officer or director of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary who is a
"disqualified individual" (as such term is defined in proposed Treasury
Regulation Section 1.280G-1) under any Parent Benefit Plan could be
characterized as an "excess parachute payment" (as defined in Section 280G(b)(1)
of the Code). Set forth in Section 4.10.6 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule is
(A) the estimated maximum amount that could be paid to any disqualified
individual as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any
Ancillary Agreement under all employment, severance and termination agreements,
other compensation arrangements and Parent Benefit Plans currently in effect,
and (B) the "base amount" (as defined in Section 280G(b)(e) of the Code) for
each such individual as of the date of this Agreement.

            Section 4.10.7 Except as required by Law, no Parent Benefit Plan
provides any of the following retiree or post-employment benefits to any person:
medical, disability or life insurance benefits. No Parent Benefit Plan is a
voluntary employee benefit association under Section 501(a)(9) of the Code.
Parent and each ERISA Affiliate are in material compliance with


                                       43
<PAGE>
(i) the requirements of the applicable health care continuation and notice
provisions of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as
amended, and the regulations (including proposed regulations) thereunder and any
similar state law and (ii) the applicable requirements of the Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended, and the regulations
(including the proposed regulations) thereunder.

      Section 4.11 Labor and Other Employment Matters.

            Section 4.11.1 Each of Parent and each Parent Subsidiary is in
compliance with all applicable Laws respecting labor, employment, fair
employment practices, terms and conditions of employment, workers' compensation,
occupational safety, plant closings, and wages and hours. None of Parent or any
Parent Subsidiary is liable for any payment to any trust or other fund or to any
Governmental Entity, with respect to unemployment compensation benefits, social
security or other benefits or obligations for employees (other than routine
payments to be made in the ordinary course of business and consistent with past
practice). Except as set forth in Section 4.11.1 of the Parent Disclosure
Schedule, none of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary is a party to any collective
bargaining or other labor union contract applicable to persons employed by
Parent or any Parent Subsidiary, and no collective bargaining agreement or other
labor union contract is being negotiated by Parent or any Parent Subsidiary.
There is no labor dispute, strike, slowdown or work stoppage against Parent or
any Parent Subsidiary pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened which
may interfere in any respect that would have a Parent Material Adverse Effect
with the respective business activities of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary. No
labor union or similar organization has otherwise been certified to represent
any persons employed by Parent or any Parent Subsidiary or has applied to
represent such employees or, to the knowledge of Parent, is attempting to
organize so as to represent such employees. None of Parent, any Parent
Subsidiary or their respective representatives or employees has committed any
unfair labor practices in connection with the operation of the respective
businesses of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary, and there is no charge or
complaint against Parent or any Parent Subsidiary by the National Labor
Relations Board or any comparable state or foreign agency pending or, to the
knowledge of Parent, threatened, except where such unfair labor practice, charge
or complaint would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected
to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. None of Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary is delinquent in payments to any of its employees for any wages,
salaries,


                                       44
<PAGE>
commissions, bonuses or other direct compensation for any services performed for
it or amounts required to be reimbursed to such employees. Each of Parent and
each Parent Subsidiary has withheld all amounts required by Law or by agreement
to be withheld from the wages, salaries, and other payments to employees, and is
not liable for any arrears of wages or any Taxes or any penalty for failure to
comply with any of the foregoing. There are no material pending claims against
Parent or any Parent Subsidiary under any workers' compensation plan or policy
or for long term disability. There are no material controversies pending or, to
the knowledge of Parent, threatened, between Parent or any Parent Subsidiary and
any of their current or former employees, which controversies have or could
reasonably be expected to result in an action, suit, proceeding, claim,
arbitration or investigation before any Governmental Entity. To Parent's
knowledge, no employee of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary is in any material
respect in violation of any term of any employment contract, non-disclosure
agreement, non-competition agreement, or any restrictive covenant to a former
employer relating to the right of any such employee to be employed by Parent or
such Parent Subsidiary because of the nature of the business conducted or
presently proposed to be conducted by it or to the use of trade secrets or
proprietary information of others. No employee of Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary has given notice, nor is Parent otherwise aware, that such employee
intends to terminate his or her employment with Parent or such Parent
Subsidiary.

            Section 4.11.2 Parent has identified in Section 4.11.2 of the Parent
Disclosure Schedule and has made available to the Company true and complete
copies of (A) all severance and employment agreements with directors, officers
or employees of or consultants to Parent or any Parent Subsidiary, (B) all
severance programs and policies of Parent and each Parent Subsidiary with or
relating to its employees, and (C) all plans, programs, agreements and other
arrangements of Parent and each Parent Subsidiary with or relating to its
directors, officers, employees or consultants which contain change in control
provisions. Except as set forth in Section 4.11.2 of the Parent Disclosure
Schedule, none of the execution and delivery of this Agreement or any Ancillary
Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby
will (either alone or in conjunction with any other event, such as termination
of employment) (A) result in any payment (including, without limitation,
severance, unemployment compensation, parachute or otherwise) becoming due to
any director or any employee of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary or


                                       45
<PAGE>
affiliate from Parent or any Parent Subsidiary or affiliate under any Parent
Benefit Plan or otherwise, (B) significantly increase any benefits otherwise
payable under any Parent Benefit Plan or (C) result in any acceleration of the
time of payment or vesting of any material benefits. No individual who is a
party to an employment agreement listed in Section 4.11.2 of the Parent
Disclosure Schedule or any agreement incorporating change in control provisions
with Parent has terminated employment or been terminated, nor has any event
occurred that could give rise to a termination event, in either case under
circumstances that has given, or could give, rise to a severance obligation on
the part of Parent under such agreement. Section 4.11.2 of the Parent Disclosure
Schedule sets forth Parent's best estimates of the amounts payable to the
executives listed therein, as a result of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement, and/or any subsequent employment termination
(including any cash-out or acceleration of options and restricted stock and any
"gross-up" payments with respect to any of the foregoing), based on compensation
data applicable as of the date of the Parent Disclosure Schedule and the
assumptions stated therein.

            Section 4.11.3 There are no pending or threatened claims (other than
claims for benefits in the ordinary course), lawsuits or arbitrations which have
been asserted or instituted against any Parent Benefit Plan, any fiduciaries
thereof with respect to their duties to the Parent Benefit Plans or the assets
of any of the trusts under any of the Parent Benefit Plans which could
reasonably be expected to result in any material liability of Parent or any
Parent Subsidiary to the PBGC, the Department of Treasury, the Department of
Labor or any Multiemployer Plan.

      Section 4.12 Tax Treatment. None of Parent, any Parent Subsidiary or, to
the knowledge of Parent, any of Parent's affiliates has taken or agreed to take
any action that would prevent the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Parent is not aware of any
agreement, plan or other circumstance that would prevent the Merger from
qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

      Section 4.13 Contracts.

      Except as filed as exhibits to the Parent SEC Filings filed prior to the
date of this Agreement, or as disclosed in Section 4.13 of the Parent Disclosure
Schedule, none of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary is a party to or bound by any
contract (A) any of the benefits to any party of which will be increased, or the
vesting of the benefits to any party


                                       46
<PAGE>
of which will be accelerated, by the occurrence of any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, or the value of any
of the benefits to any party of which will be calculated on the basis of any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, or
(B) which, as of the date hereof, (1) is a "material contract" (as such term is
defined in Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K of the SEC), (2) involves aggregate
expenditures in excess of $250,000, other than contracts for the purchase of raw
materials, components or manufacturing goods and contracts for the sale of
Parent's products in the ordinary course of business, (3) involves annual
expenditures in excess of $250,000 and is not cancelable within one year, other
than contracts for the purchase of raw materials, components or manufacturing
goods and contracts for the sale of Parent's products in the ordinary course of
business, (4) contains any non-compete or exclusivity provisions with respect to
any line of business or geographic area with respect to Parent, any Parent
Subsidiary or any of Parent's current or future affiliates, or which restricts
the conduct of any line of business by Parent, any Parent Subsidiary or any of
Parent's current or future affiliates or any geographic area in which Parent,
any Parent Subsidiary or any of Parent's current or future affiliates may
conduct business, in each case in any material respect, (5) involves the sale of
a Parent Product to a customer or distributor and provides for a right of refund
or return for any reason, including upon the occurrence of specified events or
otherwise or (6) would prohibit or materially delay the consummation of the
Merger or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any
Ancillary Agreement. Each Contract of the type described in this Section 4.13,
whether or not set forth in Section 4.13 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, is
referred to herein as a "Parent Material Contract." Each Parent Material
Contract is valid and binding on Parent and each Parent Subsidiary party thereto
and, to Parent's knowledge, each other party thereto, and in full force and
effect, and Parent and each Parent Subsidiary has in all material respects
performed all obligations required to be performed by it to the date hereof
under each Parent Material Contract and, to Parent's knowledge, each other party
to each Parent Material Contract has in all material respects performed all
obligations required to be performed by it under such Parent Material Contract,
except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
(1) prevent or materially delay consummation of the Merger, (2) otherwise
prevent or materially delay performance by Parent or Merger Sub of any of their
material obligations under this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement to which it
is a party, or (3) result in a Parent Material Adverse Effect. None of Parent or
any Parent Subsidiary knows of, or has received notice of, any violation or
default under (or any condition which with the passage of time or the giving of
notice would cause such a violation of or default under) any Parent Material
Contract or any other contract to which it is a party or by which it or any of
its properties or assets is bound, except for violations or defaults that would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to (1) prevent or
materially delay consummation of the Merger, (2) otherwise prevent or materially
delay performance by Parent or Merger Sub of any of their material obligations
under this Agreement or any Ancillary


                                       47
<PAGE>
Agreement to which it is a party or (3) result in a Parent Material Adverse
Effect. Section 4.13 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule provides Parent's good
faith estimate of the additional costs which will accrue to Parent under the
contracts described in clause (A) of Section 4.13 as a result of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement.

      Section 4.14 Litigation. Except as and to the extent set forth in Parent
SEC Filings filed prior to the date of this Agreement or in Section 4.14 of the
Parent Disclosure Schedule, (A) there is no suit, claim, action, proceeding or
investigation pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened in writing
against Parent or any Parent Subsidiary or reasonably likely to be brought
against Parent or any Parent Subsidiary or for which Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary is obligated to indemnify a third party that (1) has had or would,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect or (2) as of the date hereof, challenges the validity or
propriety, or seeks to prevent or materially delay consummation of the Merger or
any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement
and (B) none of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary is subject to any outstanding
order, writ, injunction, decree or arbitration ruling, award or other finding
which has had or would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected
to (1) prevent or materially delay consummation of the Merger, (2) otherwise
prevent or materially delay performance by Parent or Merger Sub of any of their
material obligations under this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, or (3)
result in a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

      Section 4.15 Environmental Matters. Except as would not, individually or
in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect:

any written notice, demand, letter, claim or request for information alleging

any Environmental Law.

entered into or agreed to any consent decree or order or is subject to any
judgment, decree or judicial order relating to compliance with Environmental

treatment, remediation, removal or cleanup of Hazardous Materials and, to the
knowledge of Parent, no investigation, litigation or other proceeding is pending

owned or controlled by the Company, Parent owns or has the defensible right to
use, whether through ownership, licensing or otherwise, all Intellectual
Property significant to the businesses of Parent and each Parent Subsidiary in
substantially the same manner as such businesses are conducted on the date
hereof ("Material Parent Intellectual Property"). Excepting the Intellectual
Property owned or controlled by the Company, except as set forth in Section 4.16
of the Parent Disclosure Schedule and except as would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a material adverse impact on the
validity or value of any Material Parent Intellectual Property and excluding
prior communications or dealings with the Company: (A) no written claim of
invalidity or conflicting ownership rights with respect to any Material Parent
Intellectual Property has been made by a third party and no such Material Parent
Intellectual


                                       49
<PAGE>
Property is the subject of any pending or, to Parent's knowledge, threatened
action, suit, claim, investigation, arbitration or other proceeding; (B) no
person or entity has given notice to Parent or any Parent Subsidiary that the
use of any Material Parent Intellectual Property by Parent, any Parent
Subsidiary or any licensee is infringing or has infringed any domestic or
foreign patent, trademark, service mark, trade name, or copyright or design
right, or that Parent, any Parent Subsidiary or any licensee has misappropriated
or improperly used or disclosed any trade secret, confidential information or
know-how; (C) the making, using, selling, manufacturing, marketing, licensing,
reproduction, distribution, or publishing of any process, machine, manufacture
or product related to any Material Parent Intellectual Property, is not
presently believed to infringe any domestic or foreign patent, trademark,
service mark, trade name, copyright or other intellectual property right of any
third party, and does not and will not involve the misappropriation or improper
use or disclosure of any trade secrets, confidential information or know-how of
any third party; (D) there is not believed to exist any prior act or current
conduct or use by Parent, any Parent Subsidiary or any third party that would
void or invalidate any Material Parent Intellectual Property; and (E) the
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and each Ancillary
Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby will not breach, violate or conflict with any
instrument or agreement concerning any Material Parent Intellectual Property,
will not cause the forfeiture or termination or give rise to a right of
forfeiture or termination of any of the Material Parent Intellectual Property or
impair the right of Parent or the Surviving Corporation to make, use, sell,
license or dispose of, or to bring any action for the infringement of any
Material Parent Intellectual Property. In addition, the matters disclosed on
Section 4.16 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule would not, individually or in the

all Tax Returns with the appropriate taxing authorities required to be filed as
of the date hereof, taking into account any extensions of time within which to
file such Tax Returns. The Tax Returns have accurately reflected in all material

Except as provided in Schedule 4.17.1, all material Taxes owed by Parent and

banker or other person (other than the Parent Financial Advisor, the fees and
expenses of which will be paid by Parent) is entitled to any brokerage, finder's
or other fee or commission in connection with the Merger or any other
transaction contemplated by this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement based upon

Parent, as the case may be, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or
agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it pursuant to this Agreement or

condition to the obligations of any party to effect the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement not to be
satisfied; provided, however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this
Section 5.9 shall not cure any breach of any representation or warranty

covering the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger and shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause such shares to be approved for listing
on Nasdaq, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the Effective Time.

      Section 5.12 Employee Benefit Matters. With respect to any Parent Benefit
Plan in which any director, officer or employee of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary (the "Company Employees") will participate effective as of the
Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall


                                       67
<PAGE>
cause the Surviving Corporation to, recognize all service of the Company
Employees with the Company or a Company Subsidiary, as the case may be, for
purposes of eligibility for participation in, but not for purposes of benefit
accrual, in any such Parent Benefit Plan; provided, however, that with regard
to vacation, on and after the Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or shall
cause to be provided, each Company Employee with credit for service under the
Parent vacation policy pursuant to the terms of such policy as may be amended
from time to time. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board, or an
appropriate committee of non-employee directors thereof, shall adopt a
resolution consistent with the interpretive guidance of the SEC so that the
acquisition by any officer or director of the Company who may become a covered
person of Parent for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act and the rules
and regulations thereunder ("Section 16") of shares of Parent Common Stock or
options to acquire Parent Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement and the Merger
shall be an exempt transaction for purposes of Section 16.

      Section 5.13 Indemnification of Directors and Officers.

            Section 5.13.1 Parent and the Surviving Corporation agree that the
indemnification obligations set forth in the Company Certificate and Company
By-laws shall survive the Merger (and, prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause the Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of Merger Sub to reflect such
provisions) and shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a
period of six years after the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely
affect the rights thereunder of any individual who on or prior to the Effective
Time was a director, officer, trustee, fiduciary, employee or agent of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary or who served at the request of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary as a director, officer, trustee, partner, fiduciary,
employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust,
pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise, unless such amendment or
modification is required by Law.

            Section 5.13.2 For six years from the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall provide to the Company's current directors and officers an
insurance and indemnification policy that provides coverage for events occurring
prior to the Effective Time (the "D&O Insurance") that is no less favorable than
the Company's existing policy (true and complete copies which have been
previously provided to Parent) or, if substantially equivalent


                                       68
<PAGE>
insurance coverage is unavailable, the best available coverage; provided,
however, that the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay an annual
premium for the D&O Insurance in excess of 150% of the last annual premium paid
prior to the date of this Agreement, which premium the Company represents and
warrants to be approximately $315,000. The provisions of the immediately
preceding sentence shall be deemed to have been satisfied if prepaid policies
have been obtained prior to the Effective Time for purposes of this Section
5.13, which policies provide such directors and officers with coverage for an
aggregate period of six years with respect to claims arising from facts or
events that occurred on or before the Effective Time, including, without
limitation, in respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If
such prepaid policies have been obtained prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain such policies in
full force and effect, and continue to honor the obligations thereunder. The
obligations under this Section 5.13 shall not be terminated or modified in such
a manner as to adversely affect any indemnitee to whom this Section 5.13 applies
without the consent of such affected indemnitee (it being expressly agreed that
the indemnitees to whom this Section 5.13 applies shall be third party
beneficiaries of this Section 5.13).

            Section 5.13.3 In the event Parent or the Surviving Corporation (A)
consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or
(B) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
person, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that
such continuing or surviving corporation or entity or transferee of such assets,
as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.13.

      Section 5.14 Plan of Reorganization. This Agreement is intended to
constitute a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Treasury Regulation
Section 1.368-2(g). Each party hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause the Merger to qualify, and will not knowingly take any actions or cause
any actions to be taken which could reasonably be expected to prevent the Merger
from qualifying, as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code.

      Section 5.15 Affiliate Agreements. The Company shall, within five business
days of the date hereof, deliver to Parent a list (reasonably satisfactory to
counsel for Parent)


                                       69
<PAGE>
setting forth the names of all persons who are expected to be, at the time of
the Company Stockholders' Meeting, "affiliates" of the Company for purposes of
Rule 145 under the Securities Act. The Company shall furnish such information
and documents as Parent may reasonably request for the purpose of reviewing the
list. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause each person who
is identified as an affiliate in the list furnished or supplemented pursuant to
this Section 5.15 to execute a written agreement, as soon as practicable after
the date hereof, as to such person's prospective compliance with the
restrictions imposed by Rule 145 under the Securities Act on transfer of the
shares of Parent Common Stock received by such person in the Merger.

      Section 5.16 Company Rights Agreement. The Company covenants and agrees
that it will not (i) redeem the Company Rights, (ii) amend the Company Rights
Agreement or (iii) take any action which would allow any person (as defined in
the Company Rights Agreement) other than Parent, Merger Sub or any Parent
Subsidiary to acquire beneficial ownership (for purposes of this Section 5.16,
as defined in the Company Rights Agreement) of 20% or more of the outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock without causing a Distribution Date or a
Triggering Event (as each such term is defined in the Company Rights Agreement)
to occur.

      Section 5.17 Patent Litigation and Administrative Proceedings.

            Section 5.17.1 Patent litigation counsel for both parties shall,
within one day of execution of this Agreement or as soon thereafter as possible,
cooperate in good faith to jointly file papers in the U.S. District Courts for
the Central District of California and the District of Delaware, requesting that
an immediate stay of all proceedings be entered in the following civil actions:
C.D. Cal. Case Nos. CV 00-4988-CBM and CV 02-5888-CBM, and D. Del. Case No.
01-203-SLR. The duration of each requested stay shall be through and including
August 31, 2003. Before seeking the stay in Delaware, counsel for Parent shall
exercise all reasonable efforts to acquire IBM Corporation's consent to stay all
further proceedings in Delaware. As part of the requested stays, the parties
shall request that the courts cease all further activity in the cases during the
period of stay, including refraining from issuing any further opinions or orders
on issues already previously submitted for decision. In the event that the
Merger is not consummated within the duration of the first stay to be obtained,
and if both parties believe that


                                       70
<PAGE>
an extension of the stays would be justified or desirable, then patent
litigation counsel shall cooperate to request appropriate extensions of the
stays in each forum.

            Section 5.17.2 Upon execution of this Agreement, patent prosecution
counsel for both parties shall immediately confer in good faith for the purpose
of seeking to stay opposition proceedings in the European Patent Office, and
will file papers as soon as practicable jointly requesting either that the
opposition proceeding No. IK/I-12053, be stayed through and including August 31,
2003 or until further notice (if possible) or that any impending filing
deadlines be extended by at least six months.

            Section 5.17.3 Within three days after consummation of the Merger,
(i) patent litigation counsel for both parties shall cooperate in good faith to
jointly file papers in all of the stayed litigations requesting dismissal with
prejudice of all claims, counterclaims and cross-claims (if any), and before
seeking such dismissal in Delaware, counsel for Parent shall exercise all
reasonable efforts to acquire IBM Corporation's consent to such dismissal; (ii)
patent prosecution counsel for both parties shall seek dismissal with prejudice
(or similar terminating relief) of all opposition proceedings; and (iii) in
accordance with 35 U.S.C. Section 135(c) and 37 C.F.R. Sections 1.661 and
1.666, the parties shall promptly jointly submit a copy of this Agreement to the
United States Patent Office in Interference Nos. 104,643, 104,644, and 104,645.

            Section 5.17.4 Subject to Section 5.17.5, if for any reason this
Agreement is terminated by either party prior to consummation of the Merger,
then, upon five days' written notice by the party seeking to lift the stays,
that party may unilaterally request that the stays in each of the litigations be
immediately lifted and may also immediately request a status conference.

            Section 5.17.5 As part of the stay requested in C.D. Cal. Case Nos.
CV 00-4988-CBM pursuant to Section 5.17.1, the parties shall jointly request
that the court reserve the earliest available trial date no earlier than
November 30, 2003; provided, however, that if this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to Section 7.1.4, 7.1.5, 7.1.6 or 7.1.7, the Company agrees and hereby
stipulates that it will not thereafter request, suggest or justify a trial date
any earlier than February 29, 2004, and hereby agrees to take all necessary and
reasonable steps to seek from the court an additional three-month extension of
the trial date under these circumstances.


                                       71
<PAGE>
            Section 5.17.6 Within one day of the execution of this Agreement or
as soon thereafter as practicable, patent litigation counsel for both parties
shall jointly stipulate and request that the Company be immediately relieved
from the Delaware court's requirement that it post a bond as security for the
damage award due Parent, without prejudice to possible future reinstatement;
provided, however, that as part of that stipulation, the Company shall also
stipulate to an immediate reimposition of the previous bond requirement should
the stay in Delaware be lifted prior to consummation of the Merger upon
termination of this Agreement for any reason, without any further obligation or
requirement of Parent to act. Parent's counsel shall promptly exercise all
reasonable efforts to acquire IBM Corporation's consent to effectuate this
relief, if such consent is deemed necessary or desirable to do so.

      Section 5.18 Board of Directors. Parent agrees to increase the size of the
Parent Board and shall have validly elected directors such that immediately
following the Effective Time, the Parent Board shall consist of nine directors,
including Robert Duggan and one other individual to be proposed by the Company
as soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement and satisfactory to
Parent.

      Section 5.19 Termination of 401(k) Plan. At the request of Parent, the
Company shall, effective not later than the day immediately prior to the day on
which the Effective Time occurs, terminate the Company's 401(k) Plan (the
"401(k) Plan") and no further contributions shall be made to the 401(k) Plan.
The Company shall provide to Parent and Merger Sub (i) executed resolutions by
the Company Board authorizing the termination and (ii) an executed amendment to
the 401(k) Plan sufficient to assure compliance with all applicable requirements
of the Internal Revenue Code and regulations thereunder so that the
tax-qualified status of the 401(k) Plan will be maintained at the time of
termination.

      Section 5.20 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Effective as of the date
hereof, the Company Board, or, if appropriate, any committee of the Company
Board administering the Company's Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "ESPP")),
shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions as may be required to
provide that (i) participants may not increase their payroll deductions or
purchase elections from those in effect on the date of this Agreement, (ii) no
offering period shall be commenced after the date of this Agreement, (iii) each
participant's outstanding right to purchase shares of Company Common Stock under
the ESPP shall terminate


                                       72
<PAGE>
on the day immediately prior to the day on which the Effective Time occurs,
provided that all amounts allocated to each participant's account under the ESPP
as of such date shall thereupon be used to purchase from the Company whole
shares of Company Common Stock at the applicable price determined under the
terms of the ESPP for then-outstanding offering periods using such date as the
final purchase date for each such offering period, and (iv) the ESPP shall
terminate immediately following the purchases of Company Common Stock on the day
prior to the day on which the Effective Time occurs.

interpretation of this Agreement.

any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
Agreement.

      Section 8.10 Mutual Drafting. Each party hereto has participated in the

            Section 8.11.2 Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the exclusive

agrees not to commence any such action or proceeding except in such courts, (B)
agrees that any claim in respect of any such action or


                                       93
<PAGE>
proceeding may be heard and determined in such Delaware State court or, to the
extent permitted by law, in such Federal court, (C) waives, to the fullest
extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which it may now or
hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such action or proceeding in any
such Delaware State or Federal court, and (D) waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of
such action or proceeding in any such Delaware State or Federal court. Each of
the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding
shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by law. Each party to this Agreement
irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices in
Section 8.2. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any party to
this Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by law.

            Section 8.11.3 EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY
CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE

UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF
ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY

EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (B) IT UNDERSTANDS
AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (C) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS

OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 8.11.3.

      Section 8.12 Disclosure. Any matter disclosed in any section of a party's
Disclosure Schedule shall be considered disclosed for other sections of such

disclosure does not and shall not be deemed to create or imply a standard of
materiality hereunder.

      Section 8.13 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each
of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken
together shall constitute one and the same agreement.

      Section 8.14 Specific Performance. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled
to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of the United
States or any state having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.
