<B><P>5.&#9;Eligibility and Option Limitations.</P>
</B></FONT><P><FONT FACE="Times" SIZE=2>5.1&#9;<B>Persons Eligible for Options<I>.</i></B> Options may be granted only to Employees and Consultants.

However, notwithstanding any other provision herein to the contrary, no person shall be eligible to be granted an Option under the Plan whose eligibility would require approval of the Plan by the shareholders of the Company under any law or regulation or the rules of any stock exchange or market system upon which the Stock may then be listed. If not inconsistent with any such law, regulation or rule, an Option may be granted to a person, not previously employed by the Company, as an inducement essential to entering into an employment contract with the Company.

However, eligibility in accordance with this Section shall not entitle any person to be granted an Option, or, having been granted an Option, to be granted an additional Option.</font></P><FONT FACE="Times" SIZE=2>
<P>5.2&#9;<B>Option Grant Restrictions<I>.</i></B> Options granted under the Plan may only be Nonstatutory Stock Options.</P>
<B><P>6.&#9;Terms and Conditions of Options.</P>
</B><P>Options shall be evidenced by Option Agreements specifying the number of shares of Stock covered thereby, in such form as the Board shall from time to time establish. No Option or purported Option shall be a valid and binding obligation of the Company unless evidenced by a fully executed Option Agreement. Option Agreements may incorporate all or any of the terms of the Plan by reference and shall comply with and be subject to the following terms and conditions:</P>
<P>6.1&#9;<B>Exercise Price<I>.</i></B> The exercise price for each Option shall be established in the discretion of the Board; provided, however, that the exercise price per share shall be not less than eighty-five percent (85%) of the Fair Market Value of a share of Stock on the effective date of grant of the Option. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Option may be granted with an exercise price lower than the minimum exercise price set forth above if such Option is granted pursuant to an assumption or substitution for another option in a manner qualifying under the provisions of Section&nbsp;424(a) of the Code.</P>
<P>6.2&#9;<B>Exercisability and Term of Options<I>.</i></B> Options shall be exercisable at such time or times, or upon such event or events, and subject to such terms, conditions, performance criteria and restrictions as shall be determined by the Board and set forth in the Option Agreement evidencing such Option; provided, however, that (a)&nbsp;no Option shall be exercisable after the expiration of ten (10) years after the effective date of grant of such Option, and (b)&nbsp;no Option granted to a prospective Employee or prospective Consultant may become exercisable prior to the date on which such person commences Service with a Participating Company. Subject to the foregoing, unless otherwise specified by the Board in the grant of an Option, any Option granted hereunder shall terminate ten (10) years after the effective date of grant of the Option, unless earlier terminated in accordance with its provisions.</P>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Times" SIZE=2><BLOCKQUOTE>(a)&#9;<B><I>Forms of Consideration Authorized.</i></B> Except as otherwise provided below, payment of the exercise price for the number of shares of Stock being purchased pursuant to any Option shall be made (i)&nbsp;in cash, by check or cash equivalent, (ii)&nbsp;by tender to the Company, or attestation to the ownership, of shares of Stock owned by the Optionee having a Fair Market Value (as determined by the Company without regard to any restrictions on transferability applicable to such stock by reason of federal or state securities laws or agreements with an underwriter for the Company) not less than the exercise price, (iii)&nbsp;by delivery of a properly executed notice together with irrevocable instructions to a broker providing for the assignment to the Company of the proceeds of a sale or loan with respect to some or all of the shares being acquired upon the exercise of the Option (including, without limitation, through an exercise complying with the provisions of Regulation&nbsp;T as promulgated from time to time by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System) (a <I>&quot;<B>Cashless Exercise</B>&quot;</I>), (iv)&nbsp;by such other consideration as may be approved by the Board from time to time to the extent permitted by applicable law, or (v)&nbsp;by any combination thereof. The Board may at any time or from time to time, by approval of or by amendment to the standard forms of Option Agreement described in Section&nbsp;7, or by other means, grant Options which do not permit all of the foregoing forms of consideration to be used in payment of the exercise price or which otherwise restrict one or more forms of consideration.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(b)&#9;<B>Limitations on Forms of Consideration.</b></BLOCKQUOTE>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times" SIZE=2><BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE>(i)&#9;<B>Tender of Stock.</B> Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Option may not be exercised by tender to the Company, or attestation to the ownership, of shares of Stock to the extent such tender or attestation would constitute a violation of the provisions of any law, regulation or agreement restricting the redemption of the Company&#146;s stock. Unless otherwise provided by the Board, an Option may not be exercised by tender to the Company, or attestation to the ownership, of shares of Stock unless such shares either have been owned by the Optionee for more than six (6) months (and not used for another Option exercise by attestation during such period) or were not acquired, directly or indirectly, from the Company.</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE>(ii)&#9;<B>Cashless Exercise.</B> The Company reserves, at any and all times, the right, in the Company&#146;s sole and absolute discretion, to establish, decline to approve or terminate any program or procedures for the exercise of Options by means of a Cashless Exercise.</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.4&#9;<B>Tax Withholding<I>.</i></B> The Company shall have the right, but not the obligation, to deduct from the shares of Stock issuable upon the exercise of an Option, or to accept from the Optionee the tender of, a number of whole shares of Stock having a Fair Market Value, as determined by the Company, equal to all or any part of the federal, state, local and foreign taxes, if any, required by law to be withheld by the Participating Company Group with respect to such Option or the shares acquired upon the exercise thereof. Alternatively or in addition, in its discretion, the Company shall have the right to require the Optionee, through payroll withholding, cash payment or otherwise, including by means of a Cashless Exercise, to make adequate provision for any such tax withholding obligations of the Participating Company Group arising in connection with the Option or the shares acquired upon the exercise thereof. The Fair Market Value of any shares of Stock withheld or tendered to satisfy any such tax withholding obligations shall not exceed the amount determined by the applicable minimum statutory withholding rates. The Company shall have no obligation to deliver shares of Stock or to release shares of Stock from an escrow established pursuant to the Option Agreement until the Participating Company Group&#146;s tax withholding obligations have been satisfied by the Optionee.</P>
<P>6.5&#9;<B>Repurchase Rights<I>.</i></B> Shares issued under the Plan may be subject to a right of first refusal, one or more repurchase options, or other conditions and restrictions as determined by the Board in its discretion at the time the Option is granted. The Company shall have the right to assign at any time any repurchase right it may have, whether or not such right is then exercisable, to one or more persons as may be selected by the Company. Upon request by the Company, each Optionee shall execute any agreement evidencing such transfer restrictions prior to the receipt of shares of Stock hereunder and shall promptly present to the Company any and all certificates representing shares of Stock acquired hereunder for the placement on such certificates of appropriate legends evidencing any such transfer restrictions.</P>

</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Times" SIZE=2>8.2&#9;<B>Effect of Change in Control on Options<I>.</i></B> In the event of a Change in Control, the surviving, continuing, successor, or purchasing corporation or other business entity or parent thereof, as the case may be (the </font><I><FONT FACE="Times" SIZE=2>&quot;</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Times" SIZE=2>Acquiring Corporation</font></B><FONT FACE="Times" SIZE=2>&quot;</font></I><FONT FACE="Times" SIZE=2>), may, without the consent of the Optionee, either assume the Company&#146;s rights and obligations under outstanding Options or substitute for outstanding Options substantially equivalent options for the Acquiring Corporation&#146;s stock. Any Options which are neither assumed or substituted for by the Acquiring Corporation in connection with the Change in Control nor exercised as of the date of the Change in Control shall terminate and cease to be outstanding effective as of the date of the Change in Control. Notwithstanding the foregoing, shares acquired upon exercise of an Option prior to the Change in Control and any consideration received pursuant to the Change in Control with respect to such shares shall continue to be subject to all applicable provisions of the Option Agreement evidencing such Option except as otherwise provided in such Option Agreement. Furthermore, notwithstanding the foregoing, if the corporation the stock of which is subject to the outstanding Options immediately prior to an Ownership Change Event described in Section&nbsp;8.1(a)(i) constituting a Change in Control is the surviving or continuing corporation and immediately after such Ownership Change Event less than fifty percent (50%) of the total combined voting power of its voting stock is held by another corporation or by other corporations that are members of an affiliated group within the meaning of Section&nbsp;1504(a) of the Code without regard to the provisions of Section&nbsp;1504(b) of the Code, the outstanding Options shall not terminate unless the Board otherwise provides in its discretion.</font></P><FONT FACE="Times" SIZE=2>
<B><P>9.&#9;Provision of Information.</P>
</B><P>Each Optionee shall be given access to information concerning the Company equivalent to that information generally made available to the Company&#146;s common shareholders.</P>
<B><P>10.&#9;Compliance with Securities Law.</P>
</B><P>The grant of Options and the issuance of shares of Stock upon exercise of Options shall be subject to compliance with all applicable requirements of federal, state and foreign law with respect to such securities. Options may not be exercised if the issuance of shares of Stock upon exercise would constitute a violation of any applicable federal, state or foreign securities laws or other law or regulations or the requirements of any stock exchange or market system upon which the Stock may then be listed. In addition, no Option may be exercised unless (a)&nbsp;a registration statement under the Securities Act shall at the time of exercise of the Option be in effect with respect to the shares issuable upon exercise of the Option or (b)&nbsp;in the opinion of legal counsel to the Company, the shares issuable upon exercise of the Option may be issued in accordance with the terms of an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act. The inability of the Company to obtain from any regulatory body having jurisdiction the authority, if any, deemed by the Company&#146;s legal counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any shares hereunder shall relieve the Company of any liability in respect of the failure to issue or sell such shares as to which such requisite authority shall not have been obtained. As a condition to the exercise of any Option, the Company may require the Optionee to satisfy any qualifications that may be necessary or appropriate, to evidence compliance with any applicable law or regulation and to make any representation or warranty with respect thereto as may be requested by the Company.</P>
<B><P>11.&#9;Termination or Amendment of Plan.</P>
</B><P>The Board may terminate or amend the Plan at any time. No termination or amendment of the Plan shall affect any then outstanding Option unless expressly provided by the Board. In any event, no termination or amendment of the Plan may adversely affect any then outstanding Option without the consent of the Optionee, unless such termination or amendment is necessary to comply with any applicable law, regulation or rule.</P>
<P>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned Secretary of the Company certifies that the foregoing sets forth the Applied Signal Technology, Inc. 2000 Stock Option Plan as duly adopted by the Board on May 11, 2000.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>(b)&#9;<B><I>Limitations on Forms of Consideration.</i></b></BLOCKQUOTE>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times" SIZE=2><BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE>(i)&#9;<B>Tender of Stock.</B> Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Option may not be exercised by tender to the Company, or attestation to the ownership, of shares of Stock to the extent such tender or attestation would constitute a violation of the provisions of any law, regulation or agreement restricting the redemption of the Company&#146;s stock. The Option may not be exercised by tender to the Company, or attestation to the ownership, of shares of Stock unless such shares either have been owned by the Optionee for more than six (6) months (and not used for another option exercise by attestation during such period) or were not acquired, directly or indirectly, from the Company.</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

The Company reserves, at any and all times, the right, in the Company&#146;s sole and absolute discretion, to decline to approve or terminate any such program or procedure.</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>4.4&#9;<B>Tax Withholding<I>.</i></B> At the time the Option is exercised, in whole or in part, or at any time thereafter as requested by the Company, the Optionee hereby authorizes withholding from payroll and any other amounts payable to the Optionee, and otherwise agrees to make adequate provision for (including by means of a Cashless Exercise to the extent permitted by the Company), any sums required to satisfy the federal, state, local and foreign tax withholding obligations of the Participating Company Group, if any, which arise in connection with the Option, including, without limitation, obligations arising upon (i)&nbsp;the exercise, in whole or in part, of the Option, (ii)&nbsp;the transfer, in whole or in part, of any shares acquired upon exercise of the Option, (iii)&nbsp;the operation of any law or regulation providing for the imputation of interest, or (iv)&nbsp;the lapsing of any restriction with respect to any shares acquired upon exercise of the Option.

<P>4.5&#9;<B>Certificate Registration<I>.</i></B> Except in the event the Exercise Price is paid by means of a Cashless Exercise, the certificate for the shares as to which the Option is exercised shall be registered in the name of the Optionee, or, if applicable, in the names of the heirs of the Optionee.</P>
</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Times" SIZE=2>4.6&#9;<B>Restrictions on Grant of the Option and Issuance of Shares<I>.</i></B> The grant of the Option and the issuance of shares of Stock upon exercise of the Option shall be subject to compliance with all applicable requirements of federal, state or foreign law with respect to such securities. The Option may not be exercised if the issuance of shares of Stock upon exercise would constitute a violation of any applicable federal, state or foreign securities laws or other law or regulations or the requirements of any stock exchange or market system upon which the Stock may then be listed. In addition, the Option may not be exercised unless (i)&nbsp;a registration statement under the Securities Act shall at the time of exercise of the Option be in effect with respect to the shares issuable upon exercise of the Option or (ii)&nbsp;in the opinion of legal counsel to the Company, the shares issuable upon exercise of the Option may be issued in accordance with the terms of an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act. THE OPTIONEE IS CAUTIONED THAT THE OPTION MAY NOT BE EXERCISED UNLESS THE FOREGOING CONDITIONS ARE SATISFIED. ACCORDINGLY, THE OPTIONEE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO EXERCISE THE OPTION WHEN DESIRED EVEN THOUGH THE OPTION IS VESTED. The inability of the Company to obtain from any regulatory body having jurisdiction the authority, if any, deemed by the Company</font><FONT FACE="Times" SIZE=2>&#146;</FONT><FONT FACE="Times" SIZE=2>s legal counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any shares subject to the Option shall relieve the Company of any liability in respect of the failure to issue or sell such shares as to which such requisite authority shall not have been obtained. As a condition to the exercise of the Option, the Company may require the Optionee to satisfy any qualifications that may be necessary or appropriate, to evidence compliance with any applicable law or regulation and to make any representation or warranty with respect thereto as may be requested by the Company.</font></P><FONT FACE="Times" SIZE=2>

The Optionee&#146;s Service shall be deemed to have terminated on account of death if the Optionee dies within three (3) months after the Optionee&#146;s termination of Service.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(c)&#9;<B><I>Other Termination of Service</I>.</B> If the Optionee&#146;s Service terminates for any reason, except Disability or death, the Option, to the extent unexercised and exercisable by the Optionee on the date on which the Optionee&#146;s Service terminated, may be exercised by the Optionee at any time prior to the expiration of three (3) months (or such other longer period of time as determined by the Board, in its discretion) after the date on which the Optionee&#146;s Service terminated, but in any event no later than the Option Expiration Date.</BLOCKQUOTE>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times" SIZE=2><P>7.2&#9;<B>Extension if Exercise Prevented by Law<I>.</i></B> Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the exercise of the Option within the applicable time periods set forth in Section 7.1 is prevented by the provisions of Section 4.6, the Option shall remain exercisable until three (3) months after the date the Optionee is notified by the Company that the Option is exercisable, but in any event no later than the Option Expiration Date.</P>
<B><P>8.&#9;Change in Control.</P>
</B><P>8.1&#9;<B>Definitions.</b></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times" SIZE=2><BLOCKQUOTE>(a)&#9;An <I>&quot;<B>Ownership Change Event</B>&quot;</I> shall be deemed to have occurred if any of the following occurs with respect to the Company: (i) the direct or indirect sale or exchange in a single or series of related transactions by the shareholders of the Company of more than fifty percent (50%) of the voting stock of the Company; (ii) a merger or consolidation in which the Company is a party; (iii) the sale, exchange, or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company; or (iv) a liquidation or dissolution of the Company.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(b)&#9;A <I>&quot;<B>Change in Control</B>&quot;</I> shall mean an Ownership Change Event or a series of related Ownership Change Events (collectively, a <I>&quot;<B>Transaction</B>&quot;</I>) wherein the shareholders of the Company immediately before the Transaction do not retain immediately after the Transaction, in substantially the same proportions as their ownership of shares of the Company&#146;s voting stock immediately before the Transaction, direct or indirect beneficial ownership of more than fifty percent (50%) of the total combined voting power of the outstanding voting securities of the Company or, in the case of a Transaction described in Section 8.1(a)(iii), the corporation or other business entity to which the assets of the Company were transferred (the <I>&quot;<B>Transferee</B>&quot;</I>), as the case may be. For purposes of the preceding sentence, indirect beneficial ownership shall include, without limitation, an interest resulting from ownership of the voting securities of one or more corporations or other business entities which own the Company or the Transferee, as the case may be, either directly or through one or more subsidiary corporations or other business entities. The Board shall have the right to determine whether multiple sales or exchanges of the voting securities of the Company or multiple Ownership Change Events are related, and its determination shall be final, binding and conclusive.</BLOCKQUOTE>
</FONT><P><FONT FACE="Times" SIZE=2>8.2&#9;<B>Effect of Change in Control on Option<I>.</i></B> In the event of a Change in Control, the surviving, continuing, successor, or purchasing corporation or other business entity or parent thereof, as the case may be (the <B><I>&quot;Acquiring Corporation&quot;</i></B>), may, without the consent of the Optionee, either assume the Company</font><FONT FACE="Times" SIZE=2>&#146;</FONT><FONT FACE="Times" SIZE=2>s rights and obligations under the Option or substitute for the Option a substantially equivalent option for the Acquiring Corporation</FONT><FONT FACE="Times" SIZE=2>&#146;</FONT><FONT FACE="Times" SIZE=2>s stock. The Option shall terminate and cease to be outstanding effective as of the date of the Change in Control to the extent that the Option is neither assumed or substituted for by the Acquiring Corporation in connection with the Change in Control nor exercised as of the date of the Change in Control. Notwithstanding the foregoing, shares acquired upon exercise of the Option prior to the Change in Control and any consideration received pursuant to the Change in Control with respect to such shares shall continue to be subject to all applicable provisions of this Option Agreement except as otherwise provided herein. Furthermore, notwithstanding the foregoing, if the corporation the stock of which is subject to the Option immediately prior to an Ownership Change Event described in Section 8.1(a)(i) constituting a Change in Control is the surviving or continuing corporation and immediately after such Ownership Change Event less than fifty percent (50%) of the total combined voting power of its voting stock is held by another corporation or by other corporations that are members of an affiliated group within the meaning of Section 1504(a) of the Code without regard to the provisions of Section 1504(b) of the Code, the Option shall not terminate unless the Board otherwise provides in its discretion.</font></P><FONT FACE="Times" SIZE=2>
<B><P>9.&#9;Adjustments for Changes in Capital Structure.</P>
