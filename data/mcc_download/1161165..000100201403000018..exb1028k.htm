</B></U>

<P>This Settlement and Stock Redemption Agreement (this "<B><I>Agreement</B></I>") is executed by Phillips Family Limited Partnership ("<B><I>Investor</B></I>"), a South Dakota limited partnership; Carey M. Phillips ("<B><I>Phillips</B></I>"), a Florida resident; SailTech International, Inc. (the "<B><I>Company</B></I>"), a Nevada corporation; SailTech Design, Inc. ("<B><I>SDIF</B></I>"), a Florida corporation; and SailTech Design, Inc., ("<B><I>SDIBC</B></I>"), a British Columbia corporation, both direct or indirect subsidiaries of the Company (together, the "<B><I>Subsidiaries</B></I>" and, individually, a "<B><I>Subsidiary</B></I>"), Gunter Richtler and W. Barry Girling (together, the "<B><I>Managing Shareholders</B></I>"), to record their agreements regarding the redemption by the Company of Investor's shares of common stock of the Company and related matters.</P>

<B><U><P ALIGN="CENTER">BACKGROUND</P>
</B></U>
<P>Investor acquired 7,500,000 shares (the "<B><I>SailTech Shares</B></I>") of the common stock of the Company, par value $.001 per share, on September 12, 2002, for a purchase price of $1,500,000 pursuant to the terms of a Stock Purchase Agreement dated August 31, 2001, among Investor, Phillips, the Company, SDIF, SDIBC, and the Managing Shareholders (the "<B><I>Stock Purchase Agreement</B></I>").  Section 2.6 of the Stock Purchase Agreement grants to Investor the right and option (but not the obligation) to sell to the Company, and to require the Company to purchase from Investor, at any time during the period after the occurrence of an "Event of Default" (as defined in the Stock Purchase Agreement) and before the expiration date of the put option, any or all of the shares of common stock owned by Investor at a purchase price equal to the greater of $.75 U.S. or the last price at which the Company sold any shares of the Common Stock (the "Put Option"</B></I>).  The Stock Purchase Agreement defines an "Event of Default" to include the insolvency of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries.  On Monday, July 1, 2002, Cortland Steck, an officer and director of the Company, notified the Board of Directors of the Company that SDIF is insolvent.  On Monday, July 1, 2002, following receipt of Mr. Steck's notice of insolvency, Investor exercised the Put Option and demanded payment within ten business days thereafter.  On execution of the Put Option by Investor, the Company also became insolvent.  Investor also resigned on July 1, 2002, as an officer and director of the Company and the Subsidiaries.  The amount of the Company's obligation to the Investor is $5,625,000 U.S.  </P>

<P>As an insolvent corporation, the Company is not in a position to satisfy its obligation to Investor under the Put Option by the payment of cash consideration and is in default of its obligation to Investor.  The Company's only practical alternative, without a negotiated settlement, is to file for protection under the federal bankruptcy laws.  If that were to occur, the shareholders of the Company likely would not receive any return on their investment.</P>

<P>Accordingly, the Company and Investor have agreed to the redemption of the SailTech Shares for the amount of $25,000, and the Investor has agreed to cancel certain agreements that he has with the Company. </P>

<P>B.</B>&#9;<B><U>Reimbursement</U>.</B>  The Sureties shall promptly reimburse a Beneficiary on demand for any and all costs (as defined in section 1.B of this Agreement) that are incurred by the Beneficiary in connection with investigating, preparing to defend, settling, or defending any Proceeding that is subject to indemnification under this section 12, whether or not a Beneficiary is a party or potential party to it.</P>
<B>
<P>C.</B>&#9;<B><U>Contribution</U>.</B>  If the indemnification or advancement and reimbursement of costs provided in this Agreement is either unavailable to any Beneficiary for any reason or insufficient to hold a Beneficiary harmless to the extent contemplated by this Agreement, then each Surety otherwise obligated to provide the indemnification or reimbursement of costs shall contribute to the Beneficiary pro rata the amount paid or payable by the Beneficiary for which indemnification reimbursement of costs is unavailable or insufficient.  </P>


<p align=center> - 9 - </p>
<page>
<hr>

<P>If the foregoing contribution is not permitted by applicable law, the Sureties shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by the Beneficiary for which indemnification or reimbursement of expenses is unavailable or insufficient an amount that is appropriate to reflect their relative fault in the event, matter, proposal, or transaction for which indemnification and reimbursement of expenses is unavailable or insufficient.</P>

<B>
<P>D.</B>&#9;<B><U>Payment of Indemnification Claims</U>.</B> The Sureties shall pay every indemnification claim, without any set-off, defense, deduction, or counterclaim, within 20 days after their receipt of written notice of the indemnification claim from a Beneficiary, unless the validity or amount of the indemnification claim is disputed by the Surety or the indemnification claim pertains to a Proceeding that is subject to a defense, in which case the Surety shall pay the indemnification claim within 30 days after the amount or validity of the indemnification claim is finally determined. However, the preceding sentence does not affect the Sureties' obligation to advance or promptly reimburse a Beneficiary for costs incurred by the Beneficiary in connection with the defense of any Proceeding.  If a Beneficiary is entitled to indemnification under this Agreement for only a portion of a loss, the Sureties shall indemnify the Beneficiary for that portion of the Indemnified Loss.  If a Beneficiary pays an Indemnified Loss with the approval of a Surety, or if a Beneficiary becomes legally obligated to pay an Indemnified Loss, the Sureties shall reimburse the Beneficiary for the Indemnified Loss, or pay it on behalf of the Beneficiary, in accordance with this Agreement within 20 days after the date when the Beneficiary notifies the Sureties of its request for payment or reimbursement of the Indemnified Loss.  The obligations of the Sureties under this Agreement are absolute, irrevocable, and unconditional, are not subject to any set-off, defense, deduction, or counterclaim based on a claim that any Surety might have against any Beneficiary and are not limited or affected in any way by any other agreement, any right of audit or investigation granted to Investor or Phillips by the Company, the Subsidiaries, or the Managing Shareholders, or any information obtained by Investor or Phillips or available to it or him as a result of exercising any right of audit or investigation, whether before or after the Execution Date. Every amount paid to a Beneficiary by or on behalf of a Surety pursuant to an indemnification claim will be treated by the parties to this Agreement as an adjustment of the purchase price for the SailTech Shares.  The Sureties jointly and severally shall pay to a Beneficiary, on demand, interest on the amount of any Indemnified Loss that is not paid when due, from the date when due until paid, at the annual rate then provided by Florida law for the payment of interest on judgments.</P>

<B><P>E.</B>&#9;<B><U>Defense of Third-Party Claims</U>. </B> A Surety is entitled to employ at its own cost and expense separate counsel and participate at its own cost and expense in the defense of any Proceeding for which a Beneficiary has requested or is entitled to indemnification or reimbursement of reasonable costs pursuant to this Agreement, or, at the request of that Beneficiary, shall assume the defense of the Proceeding with legal counsel selected by the Surety, but reasonably satisfactory to that Beneficiary.  </P>

<P>If a Surety assumes the defense of any Proceeding, the Sureties jointly and severally shall reimburse the Beneficiaries for all costs incurred by them in connection with the Proceeding before the Sureties assumed control of the defense of it, and the Beneficiaries may elect to participate in the defense of the Proceeding at their own cost with legal counsel selected by them in their sole discretion.  However, any party who elects to participate at its own cost in the defense of any Proceeding for which a Beneficiary has requested, or intends to request, indemnification or the advancement and reimbursement of costs under this Agreement shall cooperate, and shall cause its legal counsel to cooperate, in defending the Proceeding with the party who is responsible for controlling the defense of the Proceeding and its legal counsel.</P>
<p align=center> - 10 - </p>

<hr>

<P>Even if the Sureties assume the defense of a Proceeding, a Beneficiary will be entitled to jointly control the defense, compromise, and settlement of the Proceeding at the expense of the Sureties, if any of the following conditions or circumstances exist:  (i) the Sureties have agreed to pay the fees and expenses of the Beneficiary's separate counsel; (ii) a court having jurisdiction rules that the Sureties have failed or are failing to defend the Proceeding, in which case the Beneficiary will be entitled to assume control of the defense of the Proceeding and the Sureties shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of the separate counsel employed by the Beneficiary for that purpose; or (iii) a Beneficiary reasonably determines based on the advice of outside counsel that having common counsel with the Sureties would present an actual conflict of interest under applicable principles of legal ethics, in which case the Beneficiary may employ separate counsel to represent or defend it in the Proceeding, and the Sureties shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of not more than one separate counsel in addition to local counsel for the Beneficiary in connection with any single Proceeding or separate but related or similar Proceeding involving claims arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances.</P>

<P>If a Beneficiary employs separate counsel and participates in a Proceeding for which the Surety has assumed the defense, the Beneficiary shall cooperate and shall cause its legal counsel to cooperate, with the Surety and its legal counsel in the defense of the Proceeding assumed by the Surety.  If the Surety does not assume the defense of a Proceeding for which a Beneficiary has requested indemnification, or if the Surety is otherwise obligated to pay the fees and costs of any separate counsel employed by a Beneficiary to defend or represent it in a Proceeding, each Beneficiary who is entitled to employ separate counsel to defend or represent it in the Proceeding at the expense of the Surety shall obtain the Surety's advance written approval of the legal counsel to be engaged by the Beneficiary to defend or represent it in the Proceeding (which the Surety shall not unreasonably delay or withhold).</P>
<B>
<P>F.</B>&#9;<B><U>Settlement of Claims</U>.</B>  The Sureties shall not, and they shall not permit any of their respective agents, officers, directors, employees, or shareholders to, settle, compromise, or admit civil liability in any pending or threatened Proceeding for which a Beneficiary has requested or is entitled to indemnification under this Agreement, unless either (a) the Sureties obtain the advance written consent of every Beneficiary who requested or is entitled to indemnification or advancement and reimbursement of costs pursuant to this Agreement (which consent they shall not unreasonably delay or withhold) or (b) the settlement, compromise, or admission of civil liability includes the unconditional release of all the Beneficiaries from all liability arising out of the Proceeding.</P>
