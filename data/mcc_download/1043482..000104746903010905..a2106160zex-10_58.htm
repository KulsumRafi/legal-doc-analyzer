<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>SCOPE OF MARKETING AGREEMENT  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties to the Beverage Marketing Agreement (the "Agreement") are Mrs.&nbsp;Fields Original Cookies,&nbsp;Inc. ("MFOC") and Coca-Cola Fountain
("CCF"), part of The Coca-Cola Company. The Agreement will apply to all outlets where Fountain Beverages and Juice Beverages are served that are owned or operated by MFOC or any of its
subsidiaries, including any outlets that are opened after the Agreement is signed. The Agreement will also apply to acquired outlets (including outlets owned or operated by an acquired business),
unless those outlets are already governed by an agreement with CCF and that agreement is validly assigned to MFOC as part of the acquisition. If the acquired outlet is currently under a
pre-existing agreement with a competitive beverage supplier, the acquired outlet will come under this Agreement after the competitive agreement is terminated or expires. MFOC will cause
all TCBY outlets, including those that are newly opened or acquired to comply with the terms of this Agreement. The Agreement will not apply to any outlets outside the fifty United States. All outlets
owned or operated by MFOC are referred to as "Corporate Outlets." Outlets owned by authorized franchisees of MFOC are referred to as "Franchised Outlets." The programs described in this Agreement are
the only programs in which the Corporate and Franchised Outlets may participate during the Term. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>TERM  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Agreement will become effective when signed by both parties and the Term shall begin as of January&nbsp;1, 2003 and will continue for a period of six
(6)&nbsp;years or until the Participating System Outlets (as defined below) have purchased the Volume Commitment of CCF's Fountain Syrups and the Volume Commitment of CCF's Juice Beverages,
whichever occurs last. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When
used in the Agreement, the term "Year" means each consecutive twelve-month period during the Term, beginning with the first day of the Term. The Beverage Marketing Agreement between
MFOC and CCF dated January&nbsp;9, 1997 (the "1997 Agreement") and the Juice Beverage Marketing Agreement between MFOC and CCF dated September&nbsp;28, 2001 (the "2001 Juice Agreement"), will
govern the relationship between the parties until the beginning of the Term. After the Term begins, except for those amounts listed as outstanding in this Agreement under the "Prior Agreement"
section, MFOC has no further obligations under the 1997 Agreement and the 2001 Juice Agreement. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>FOUNTAIN BEVERAGE AVAILABILITY  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The term "Beverage" means all soft drinks and other non-alcoholic beverages, including non-dairy beverages, dairy-based beverages, waters,
sports drinks, frozen beverages, juices, juice-containing drinks, punches, ades, bar mixers and iced teas, whether carbonated or non-carbonated. "Fountain Beverages" are those Beverages
that are dispensed from Fountain Beverage dispensers, pre-mix or frozen beverage dispensers, bubblers, or similar equipment. Coffee or tea that is fresh-brewed on the premises and milk is
not considered Fountain Beverages. The term "Fountain Syrup" means the Fountain Beverage syrup used to prepare Fountain Beverages, but does not include other forms of concentrate,
BreakMate&reg; syrup, or syrup for frozen Beverages. "Frozen Beverages" are those frozen or any partially frozen Beverages that are dispensed from frozen Beverages dispensers and served in
frozen or partially frozen form. "Frozen Syrup" means the post-mix syrup used to prepare Frozen Beverages but does not include </FONT></P>

syrup for Frozen Beverages that is purchased from a full service supplier of Frozen Beverage to which CCF provides promotional funding. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MFOC
will serve in each Corporate Outlet a core brand set of Fountain Beverages that consists of Coca-Cola&reg; classic, diet Coke&reg; and
Sprite&reg;, and the remaining products will be jointly selected by MFOC and CCF. All Fountain Beverages served in the Corporate Outlets will be CCF's brands, with the exception of dairy-based
Beverages, MFOC's proprietary lemonade and smoothies freshly made on the premises. Under no circumstances, however, may MFOC serve any Fountain Beverages PepsiCo,&nbsp;Inc. in
the Corporate Outlets. In addition, the parties acknowledge that there certain Participating System Outlets that have pre-existing competitive agreement(s) ("Pre-Existing
Competitive Agreement") with a competitive Beverage supplier to purchase "Freshens" smoothies (the "Affected Location"). In such Affected Locations and only during such time as the
Pre-Existing Competitive Agreement is in effect, MFOC's sale of Freshens smoothies at any Affected Location will not be considered a breach of this Agreement. Each Affected Location will
make available proprietary smoothies freshly made on the premises upon the termination or expiration of the Pre-Existing Competitive Agreement. All Frozen Beverages served in the Corporate
Outlets will be CCF's brands. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MFOC
further recognizes that the sale of competitive Beverages in bottles, cans, or other packaging would diminish the product availability rights given to CCF, and therefore also agrees
not to serve competitive Beverages in bottles, cans or other packaging in the Corporate Outlets. MFOC will cause the Franchised Outlets to comply with this Fountain Beverage Availability section. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>SYSTEM PROGRAM  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties agree that all of the funding described in this Agreement will be paid to MFOC for the benefit of the entire Mrs.&nbsp;Fields Cookies, Great
American Cookies, TCBY, Original Cookie Company, PreztelTime, Pretzelmaker, and Hot Sams Pretzels system ("System") and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and the franchise agreements
between MFOC and its franchisees (the "Franchise Agreements"). MFOC represents and warrants that the terms of the Franchise Agreements authorize MFOC, among other things: (i)&nbsp;to establish those
products and materials to be used in the System; (ii)&nbsp;to require that each Franchisee sell or offer for sale only those products, foods, Beverages and other menu items that have been expressly
approved by MFOC; and (iii)&nbsp;to designate and approve marketing and advertising programs for the System. MFOC further represents and warrants that it is authorized to enter into this Agreement
and to collect the funds described in this Agreement. MFOC agrees to provide CCF with prompt written notice of any event that terminates its rights to fulfill any of the provisions of this Agreement
or that causes MFOC's right on behalf of the System as contemplated by this Agreement to become unenforceable during the Term. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MFOC
agrees that all funding it receives under this Agreement will be used as MFOC, in consultation with CCF, deems appropriate, to develop and implement activities designed to benefit
the entire System, and to increase the promotion and merchandising of CCF's Fountain Beverages and Juice Beverages throughout the System. MFOC agrees to provide all franchisees with written
notification, in a form approved by CCF, of the existence of this Agreement and the nature and purpose of the funding being provided by CCF under this Agreement. The parties agree that MFOC will
determine the timing and extent to which any funding paid by CCF will be distributed to individual franchisees (if ever), except that funding may not be paid to franchisees that do not comply with the
performance and Fountain Beverage availability requirements of this Agreement as determined by MFOC. MFOC agrees to hold CCF harmless from any and all claims or other costs and liabilities arising out
of CCF's payment of funding to MFOC or out of MFOC's failure to provide required disclosures to Franchisees. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MFOC
represents and warrants that the terms of its franchisee agreement or another agreement it has executed with its Franchisees authorize MFOC to collect from suppliers marketing or

allowances made available in connection with the purchase of such suppliers' products by Franchisees ("the Authorization"). MFOC further represents and warrants that all of its Franchisees have
executed such Authorization and that the Authorization is in effect and enforceable at the time of this Agreement. Should the Authorization terminate as to one or more Franchisees, or the applicable
provisions become unenforceable during the Term, MFOC agrees to provide prompt written notice of same. MFOC agrees that all funding it receives on behalf of the Participating System will be utilized
by MFOC for the benefit of the Participating System, including specifically Participating Franchisees, and to increase the sale of CCF's Fountain Beverages throughout the Participating System. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Franchisees
participating in this Agreement are referred to as "Participating Franchisees." Outlets owned by Participating Franchisees are referred to as "Participating Franchised
Outlets." Participating Franchised Outlets and Corporate Outlets are collectively referred to as "Participating System Outlets" or the "Participating System." </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>FOUNTAIN BEVERAGE VOLUME COMMITMENT  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MFOC agrees that the Participating System Outlets will purchase </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>[CONFIDENTIAL]</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>* of CCF's
Fountain Syrups and Frozen Syrups during the Term. This Term Volume Commitment will be increased by CCF if MFOC or the Participating Franchisees acquire additional Corporate or Franchised Outlets to
which the Agreement will apply. Projected annual volume is currently </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>[CONFIDENTIAL]</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>*. In addition, MFOC will purchase a minimum
of </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>[CONFIDENTIAL]</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>* of bottle/can Beverages during the Term pursuant to an agreement between MFOC and Coca-Cola
Enterprises&nbsp;Inc. ("CCE") entered into contemporaneously with the execution of this Agreement. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>FOUNTAIN BEVERAGE MARKETING PROGRAM  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In consideration of the Beverage Availability rights granted to CCF above, the following marketing programs will be provided to assist MFOC in maximizing the sale
of Fountain Beverages and Frozen Beverages in the Participating System Outlets: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Business Development Funds.</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within three (3)&nbsp;days of the execution of this Agreement, CCF will make a
one-time advance of Business Development Funds to MFOC in the amount of </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>[CONFIDENTIAL]</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>* (the "Advance"). The purpose
of the Advance is to develop a flavor shot program and a Dannon water program for the Participating System. In addition, the Advance will be used to expand the Mrs.&nbsp;Fields' Famous Brands
fruit-head smoothie program throughout the Participating System and to offset the costs of implementing and maintaining throughout the Term quality Fountain and Frozen Beverage programs in
the Participating System. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marketing Funds.</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the Participating System Outlets have purchased </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><B>[CONFIDENTIAL]</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>*
of CCF's Fountain Syrups and Frozen Syrups (the "Volume Threshold"), the Participating System Outlets will begin
to earn Marketing Funds calculated at the rate of </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>[CONFIDENTIAL]</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>* for each gallon of CCF's Fountain Syrups and Frozen Syrups the
Participating System Outlets purchase from that point forward until the end of the Term. The initial Volume Threshold of </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><B>[CONFIDENTIAL]</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>* is established by adding the Business Development Funds and the
associated capital charge and dividing the sum
by </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>[CONFIDENTIAL]</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>*. The Volume Threshold will be adjusted down on an annual basis, for each Year completed as follows: Year Two </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><B>[CONFIDENTIAL]</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>*; Year Three

the Volume Threshold upon the expiration of this Agreement, but MFOC has satisfied the Term of the Agreement by operating under this Agreement for the later of six (6)&nbsp;years or the fulfillment
of the Volume Commitment as described more specifically in the "Term" section, the parties acknowledge and agree that MFOC will not owe any funds to CCF based on the remaining Volume Threshold. To </FONT></P>

there is no material adverse change in MFOC's financial condition, MFOC may request that CCF advance on a semi-annual basis beginning with the six-month period starting
May&nbsp;1, 2003, based on the number of gallons of CCF's Fountain and Frozen Syrups CCF estimates that the Participating System will purchase during the advance period (the "Volume Estimates"). To
estimate the number of gallons, CCF will consider the number of gallons of Fountain and Frozen Syrups purchased by the Participating System in the prior six-month time period and adjust
that amount based on actual and anticipated outlet openings and closings and reconcile that amount for any overpayments or underpayments made in the prior six-month advance. For each such
advance payment of Marketing Funds, CCF will increase the Volume Threshold by the amount of the Volume Estimate. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On
a quarterly basis of each calendar year throughout the Term, MFOC will provide such financial information, including financial statements, letters that MFOC receives from lenders,
representations of MFOC officers, and representations that MFOC receives from auditors, as CCF reasonably requests to confirm that no defaults or material adverse changes have occurred. CCF shall have
thirty (30)&nbsp;days to assess this information and determine whether to advance Marketing Funds. </FONT></P>

equipment, flavor changes, or service necessitated by damage or adjustments to the equipment resulting from misuse, abuse, failure to follow operating instructions or service by unauthorized personnel
is not considered regular service and will not be provided free of charge. CCF will invoice MFOC or the individual Participating Franchisee for the actual unsubsidized cost of service calls (including
labor, necessary travel time and replacement parts) necessitated by any of the above and payment will be due upon receipt. In the event that any Participating System Outlet incurs service calls in

for such calls. Should the Participating System Outlet fail to pay any billed amount within thirty (30)&nbsp;days, CCF shall send a "Past Due Notice" to the Participating System Outlet with a copy

pursue mediation or if that procedure is unsuccessful, the dispute will be resolved by binding arbitration administered by AAA in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Rules&nbsp;using a single
arbitrator, at a location selected by AAA based on the convenience of the parties and the location of potential witnesses. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award specific performance and any
other appropriate remedies including interim injunctive relief to maintain the status quo pending the conclusion of arbitration. The prevailing party shall also be entitled to recover its reasonable
attorneys' fees and other costs and expenses of litigation. A judgment on the award of the arbitrator may be entered in any court with jurisdiction. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>A. CONFIDENTIALITY  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither party shall disclose to any third party without the prior written consent of the other party, any information concerning this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, except for disclosure to any employees, attorneys, accountants and consultants involved in assisting with the negotiation and closing of the contemplated

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>FORCE MAJEURE  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Either party is excused from performance under this Agreement if such nonperformance results from any act of God, strikes, war, riots, acts of governmental
authorities, shortage of raw materials or any other cause outside the reasonable control of the nonperforming party. Specifically, if a serious crop failure or other event occurs during the Term of
this Agreement which causes a significant increase in the cost of fruit solids, CCF has the right to negotiate with MFOC a new mutually agreed upon price for the Juice Beverages. If the parties are
unable to reach an agreement or price for the Juice Beverages, either party has the right to terminate this Agreement upon thirty (30)&nbsp;days written notice. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><B>LEASE AGREEMENT AND TERM</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>. The Coca-Cola Company, through its Coca-Cola North America division,
("Company") hereby leases to the account identified on the attached Beverage Marketing Agreement ("Lessee") all fountain beverage dispensing equipment described on the attached Beverage Marketing
Agreement (the "Equipment"), subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Lease Agreement. Unless otherwise agreed in writing, the Equipment shall include all permanent merchandising, menu
boards, lines, fittings, carbonators, regulators, valves, refrigeration units, and bag-in-box pumps and racks installed by Company on Lessee's premises. All Equipment is leased
for an initial period of one (1)&nbsp;year, commencing on the scheduled installation date (the "Commencement Date"), and will continue on a year to year basis thereafter without further notice. This
Lease Agreement may be terminated by either party on any annual anniversary of the Commencement Date by sending the other party notice of termination not less than thirty (30)&nbsp;days prior to the
end of the then-current year of the term. If this Lease is terminated for any reason prior to 60&nbsp;months from the Commencement Date, other than a termination by Company pursuant to
this section, upon termination Lessee shall reimburse Company for the actual costs of installation and removal and the standard costs for refurbishing such Equipment incurred by Company. Following
notice of termination, the terms of this Lease will continue in effect until the Equipment has been removed from Lessee's premises. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><B>RENT FOR THE EQUIPMENT</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>. Lessee shall pay to Company the amount set forth on the attached Beverage Marketing Agreement plus
all applicable sales and use taxes, if any, as rent for the Equipment. Rent will be due monthly. At Company's discretion, Company may utilize funds due Lessee to offset amounts due Company under this
Agreement. If Lessee fails to pay, within 10&nbsp;days of its due date, rent or any other amount required by this Lease to be paid to Company, Lessee shall pay to Company a late charge equal to five
percent (5%) per month of such overdue payment, or such lesser amount that Company is entitled to receive under any applicable law. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><B>TITLE TO THE EQUIPMENT</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>. Title&nbsp;to the Equipment is, and will at all times remain, vested in Company. Lessee will
have no right, title, or interest in or to the Equipment, except the right to quiet use of the Equipment in the ordinary course of its business as provided in this Lease. Lessee shall execute such
title documents, financing statements, fixture filings, certificates and such other instruments and documents as Company shall reasonably request to ensure to Company's satisfaction the protection of
Company's title to the Equipment and Company's interests and benefits under this Lease. Lessee shall not transfer, pledge, lease, sell, hypothecate, mortgage, assign or in any other way encumber or
dispose of any of the Equipment. THE PARTIES AGREE, AND LESSEE WARRANTS, THAT THE EQUIPMENT IS, AND WILL AT ALL TIMES REMAIN, PERSONAL PROPERTY OF COMPANY NOTWITHSTANDING THAT THE EQUIPMENT OR ANY
PART THEREOF MAY&nbsp;NOW BE, OR HEREAFTER BECOME, IN ANY MANNER AFFIXED OR ATTACHED TO, OR EMBEDDED IN, OR PERMANENTLY RESTING UPON, REAL PROPERTY OR IMPROVEMENTS ON REAL PROPERTY. Lessee may
perform ordinary maintenance and repairs to
the Equipment as required by this Lease, but shall not make any alterations, additions, or improvements to the Equipment without the prior written consent of Company. All parts added to the Equipment
through alterations, repairs, additions or improvements will constitute accessions to, and will be considered an item of the Equipment and title to such will immediately vest in Company. Lessee agrees
that Company may transfer or assign all or any part of Company's right, title and interest in or to any Equipment (in whole or in part) and this Lease, and any amounts due or to become due, to any
third party ("Assignee") for any reason. Upon receipt of written notice from Company of such assignment, Lessee shall perform all its obligations with respect to any such Equipment for the benefit of
the applicable Assignee, and, if so directed, shall pay all amounts due or to become due hereunder directly to the applicable Assignee or to any other party designated by such Assignee. </FONT></P>

Equipment to Lessee for the purpose of dispensing Company products. Therefore, Lessee agrees that if the Equipment is a fountain beverage dispenser, then the Equipment will be used for the purpose of
dispensing fountain beverage products of Company, such as Coca-Cola&reg; classic (or Coke&reg;), diet Coke&reg; and Sprite&reg;, with the understanding
that, if the dispenser has four (4)&nbsp;or more valves, one (1)&nbsp;valve may be used at Lessee's option for dispensing a non-Company, non-cola fountain beverage product;
provided, that no product of PepsiCo,&nbsp;Inc. or of an affiliate thereof may be dispensed. In accordance with Company's Fair Share Policy, Company will have the right to additional rent if any
valve is used for a non-Company beverage (including water), at a rate of not less than $45 per dispenser per year. If the Equipment is a pump for bag-in-box or
similar container, such pump may be used only to dispense Company products. If the Equipment is other than a fountain beverage dispenser or a pump, then it will be used only in a location where
fountain beverage products of Company are served and where no fountain beverage products of PepsiCo,&nbsp;Inc. or an affiliate of PepsiCo,&nbsp;Inc. are served. This Section&nbsp;4 shall not
apply within the State of Wisconsin. </FONT></P>

SIZE=2><B>INSPECTION AND NOTIFICATION</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>. Company shall have the right during Lessee's regular business&nbsp;hours to inspect the
Equipment at Lessee's premises or wherever the Equipment may be located and to review all records that relate to the Equipment. Lessee shall promptly notify Company of all details arising out of any
change in location of the Equipment, any alleged encumbrances thereon or any accident allegedly resulting from the use or operation thereof. </FONT></P>

SIZE=2><B>WARRANTY DISCLAIMER</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>: LESSEE ACKNOWLEDGES THAT COMPANY IS NOT A MANUFACTURER OF THE EQUIPMENT AND THAT COMPANY HAS MADE NO
REPRESENTATIONS OF ANY NATURE WHATSOEVER PERTAINING TO THE EQUIPMENT OR ITS PERFORMANCE, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING (WITHOUT LIMITATION) ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR ANY OTHER WARRANTIES RELATING TO THE DESIGN, CONDITION, QUALITY, CAPACITY, MATERIAL OR WORKMANSHIP OF THE EQUIPMENT OR ITS PERFORMANCE, OR ANY WARRANTY AGAINST
INTERFERENCE OR INFRINGEMENT, OR ANY WARRANTY WITH RESPECT TO PATENT RIGHTS, IF ANY, PERTAINING TO THE EQUIPMENT. COMPANY SHALL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, ANY DIRECT, INCIDENTAL OR

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><B>TAXES</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>. Lessee shall pay all assessments, license fees, taxes (including sales, use, excise, personal property, ad valorem,
stamp, documentary and other taxes) and all other governmental charges, fees, fines or penalties whatsoever, whether payable by Company or Lessee, on or relating to the Equipment or the use,
registration, rental, shipment, transportation, delivery, or operation thereof, and on or relating to this Lease. </FONT></P>

SIZE=2><B>MAINTENANCE AND REPAIRS</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>. If Lessee elects to use one valve to dispense a non-Company beverage pursuant to
Section&nbsp;4, Company may charge for its costs of servicing such valve in accordance with Company's Fair Share Policy at a rate of not less than $25 per outlet per year. Lessee shall, at its
expense, keep the Equipment in good condition, repair, and working order. Lessee shall pay all costs incurred in connection with the shipment, use, operation, ownership, or possession of the Equipment
during the term of this Lease. Lessee's sole recourse against Company with respect to service provided by Company or its agents to the Equipment is that Company will correct any defective workmanship
at no additional charge to Lessee, provided that Company is given prompt notification of any defective workmanship. Company shall not be otherwise liable for negligent acts or omissions committed in
regard to maintenance or repair of the Equipment and assumes no responsibility for incidental, consequential or special damages occasioned by such negligent acts or omissions. </FONT></P>

or in part, will impair the obligations of Lessee under this Lease, all of which will continue in full force and effect. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><B>INDEMNITY</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>. Lessee shall indemnify Company and Company's officers, agents, employees, directors, shareholders, affiliates,
successors, and assigns (hereinafter the "Indemnified Parties") against, and hold Indemnified Parties wholly harmless from, any and all claims, actions, suits, proceedings, demands, damages, and
liabilities of whatever nature, and all costs and expenses, including without limitation Company's reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, relating to or in any way arising out of (a)&nbsp;the
ordering, delivery, rejection, installation, purchase, leasing, maintenance, possession, use, operation, control or disposition of the Equipment or any portion thereof; (b)&nbsp;any act or omission
of Lessee, including but not limited to any loss or damage to or sustained by Company arising out of Lessee's failure to comply with all the terms and conditions of this Lease; (c)&nbsp;any claims
for liability in tort with respect to the Equipment, excepting only to the degree such claims are the result of Company's negligent or willful acts. The provisions of this Section&nbsp;10 will
survive termination and expiration of this Lease. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><B>DEFAULT</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>. The occurrence of any of the following will constitute a "Default" by Lessee: (a)&nbsp;nonpayment by Lessee
when due of any amount due and payable under this Lease; (b)&nbsp;failure of Lessee to comply with any provision of this Lease, and failure of Lessee to remedy, cure, or remove such failure within
ten (10)&nbsp;days after receipt of written notice thereof from Company; (c)&nbsp;any statement, representation, or warrant of Lessee to Company, at any time, that is untrue as of the date made;
(d)&nbsp;Lessee's becoming insolvent or unable to pay its debts as they mature, or Lessee making an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or any proceeding, whether voluntary or involuntary,
being instituted by or against Lessee alleging that Lessee is insolvent or unable to pay its debts as they mature; (e)&nbsp;appointment of a receiver, liquidator, trustee, custodian or other similar
official for any of the Equipment or for any property in which Lessee has an interest; (f)&nbsp;seizure of any of the Equipment; (g)&nbsp;default by Lessee under the terms of any note, document,
agreement or instrument evidencing an obligation of Lessee to Company or to any affiliate of Company, whether now existing or hereafter arising; (h)&nbsp;Lessee taking any action with respect to the
liquidation, dissolution, winding up or otherwise discontinuing the conduct of its business; (i)&nbsp;Lessee transferring all or substantially all of its assets to a third party; or (j)&nbsp;the
transfer, conveyance, assignment or pledge of a controlling interest or ownership of Lessee to a third party without Company's prior written consent. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><B>OPTION TO ACCELERATE AT WILL</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>. If at any time Company in good faith believes that the prospect for Lessee's payment or
other performance under this Lease is impaired, Company may demand immediate payment of all rents due and scheduled to come due during the remainder of the Lease term. All future rent accelerated
under this or any other provision of this Agreement will be discounted to present value, which will be computed at a discount rate of five (5)&nbsp;percent. Failure of Lessee to make full payment
within thirty (30)&nbsp;days of its receipt of the demand for accelerated rent will constitute a "Default" by Lessee as defined in Section&nbsp;11. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><B>REMEDIES</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>. Upon the occurrence of any Default or at any time thereafter, Company may terminate this Lease as to any or all
items of Equipment, may enter Lessee's premises and retake possession of the Equipment at Lessee's expense, and will have all other remedies at law or in equity for breach of the Lease. Lessee
acknowledges that in the event of a breach of Sections 4 or 5 or a failure or refusal of Lessee to relinquish possession of the Equipment in breach of this section&nbsp;following termination or
Default, Company's damages would be difficult or impossible to ascertain, and Lessee therefore agrees that Company will have the right to an injunction in any court of competent jurisdiction
restraining said breach and granting Company the right to immediate possession of the Equipment. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><B>LIQUIDATED DAMAGES</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>. If Lessee acts in violation of the prohibitions described in Section&nbsp;3 of this Agreement, or
is unable or unwilling to return the Equipment to Company in good working order, normal usage wear and tear excepted, at the expiration or termination of the Lease, Lessee shall pay as liquidated
damages the total of: (i)&nbsp;the amount of past-due lease payments, discounted accelerated future lease payments, and the value of Company's residual interest in the </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><B>OTHER TERMS</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>. No failure by Company to exercise and no delay in exercising any of Company's rights hereunder will operate
as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any other rights. This Lease constitutes the entire agreement
of the parties and supersedes all prior oral and written agreements between the parties governing the subject matter of this Lease; provided, however, that if Company and Lessee have entered into a
Marketing Agreement into which this Lease is incorporated, to the extent that any of the terms in this Lease conflict with the terms set forth in the Marketing Agreement, the terms of the Marketing
Agreement will control. No agreement will be effective to amend this Lease unless such agreement is in writing and signed by the party to be charged thereby. Any notices permitted or required by this
Lease will be in writing and mailed by certified mail or hand delivered, addressed to the respective addresses of the parties. All claims, actions or suits arising out of the Lease shall be litigated
in courts in either the State of Georgia or in the state of Lessee's principal place of business. Each party hereby consents to the jurisdiction of any local, state or federal court located within the
State of Georgia and/or the state of Lessee's principal place of business, and designates the Secretary of State of the State as its agent for service of process. THIS LEASE WILL BE GOVERNED BY THE
LAWS OF THE STATE OF GEORGIA. Time is of the essence to each and all of the provisions of this Lease. </FONT></P>
