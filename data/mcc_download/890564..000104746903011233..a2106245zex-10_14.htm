<P><FONT SIZE=2>Dear
Michael: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
are pleased that you have agreed to accept the position of Chief Operating Officer for On Assignment,&nbsp;Inc.'s Healthcare Staffing Division ("HS"). You will be reporting directly
to Joe Peterson, our Chief Executive Officer. This letter explains the compensation structure for your position and the other terms and conditions of your employment. Your primary responsibilities
include the day-to-day management of HS's operations by providing leadership and strategic direction in order to ensure that HS achieves the goals and objectives set in place
for fiscal 2002 and beyond. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Base Salary  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your annualized base salary has been established at $300,000. Your base salary will be reviewed at the end of each year in conjunction with establishing a
performance based incentive compensation plan for the next calendar year. You are classified as an exempt employee. Certain components of your compensation are expressed by dividing the annualized
amounts by 26. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your
performance evaluation will be based on but not limited to such factors as: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Incentive Compensation Plan  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will be eligible for an incentive compensation plan that will be based on your successful achievement of HS and personal objectives. For June&nbsp;2002
through June&nbsp;2004, you will be eligible to earn up to 100% of your base salary as incentive compensation. Your incentive program will be based specifically on attaining the Board-approved
revenue and operating income objectives, and other defined objectives and goals for HS. Relative to your incentive compensation plan you will find attached a matrix outlining the specific objectives
and means of measure. This matrix will be the barometer upon which your incentive compensation will be determined for the period ending December&nbsp;31, 2002. For the fiscal years commencing with
2003, a new incentive compensation scheme will be developed and will be based on the Board-approved financial and operating plans. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Stock Options  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon your hire date with the On Assignment's International Division, you were provided a stock option grant to purchase 50,000 shares of On Assignment's Common

date, with the remainder vesting <SUP>1</SUP>/<SMALL>36</SMALL> per month over the remaining 36-month period. This can be a potentially significant component of your overall compensation package.
Detailed information regarding your stock option grant will be provided at a later date. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Relocation  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As agreed, you will continue to live in the townhouse that you leased in partnership with On Assignment for the first six months while in Cincinnati. On

sign a lease on your own behalf. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On
Assignment realizes that your relocation to the United States is a big transition for you and your family. In light of this, we agree to purchase a total of 6 round trip tickets for
the purpose of your children to visit during their school vacations annually as well as an additional 3 round trip tickets for Geraldine to visit the U.K. this year to accompany Christopher to school.
It is agreed that the tickets will be purchased as far in advance as possible, in Economy Class, London/Cincinnati, and not to exceed the amount of $1000 round trip for each ticket (unless travel is
in case of an emergency). The number of roundtrip tickets On Assignment agrees to pay for the above reasons is not to exceed nine round tip tickets in total. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
On Assignment,&nbsp;Inc. terminates your employment without cause, your bi-weekly salary (and related benefits) will continue for twelve months after the date of your
termination. An additional twelve months of salary and benefits will be paid if such termination occurs either within twelve months of the appointment of a new Chief Executive Officer of the Company

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Assignment provides 8 paid holidays and a personal time off policy (PTO). Personal time off is accrued based on your length of service and accrued days can be
used for any purpose. Wherever possible PTO should be requested in advance and approved by your supervisor. You will receive 20&nbsp;days (four work weeks) of personal time off annually. PTO is
