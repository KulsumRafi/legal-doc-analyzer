                               GENERAL INFORMATION

Under The Hartford  Deferred  Restricted  Stock Unit Plan (the "Plan"),  certain
employees of The Hartford  Financial  Services Group,  Inc. and its subsidiaries
(the "Company") may elect to forego receipt of (i) cash compensation,  including
cash bonuses,  and/or (ii) shares of Company  common stock  ("Common  Stock") or
other stock-based awards granted pursuant to any Company plan or arrangement, in
each case as determined and approved from time to time by the  Compensation  and
Personnel  Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Committee"),
in exchange for restricted contractual rights ("Units") to receive Common Stock.
As more fully set forth in the Plan,  the Committee has the discretion to award,
or not to award,  Units to  employee  participants  who have  previously  made a
proper election to receive Units.  The Committee may award Units pursuant to the
restricted stock provisions of the The Hartford Incentive Stock Plan ("Incentive
Stock Plan"), under which the Plan is implemented.

AN  EMPLOYEE'S  ELECTION  TO  RECEIVE  UNITS  IS  IRREVOCABLE  UNLESS  OTHERWISE
DETERMINED BY THE COMMITTEE IN ITS SOLE DISCRETION. PARTICIPANTS RECEIVING UNITS
WILL  GENERALLY  NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE  COMMON  STOCK UNTIL THE END OF A
THREE YEAR  RESTRICTION  PERIOD OR OTHER  RESTRICTION  PERIOD  PERMITTED  BY THE
COMMITTEE, EXCEPT IN CERTAIN CASES AS SET FORTH IN THE PLAN. THE MARKET PRICE OF
THE COMMON  STOCK WILL  FLUCTUATE  AND ON THE DATE THAT A  PARTICIPANT  RECEIVES
COMMON STOCK,  THE MARKET PRICE MAY BE MORE OR LESS THAN THE MARKET PRICE ON THE
DATE THAT AWARDS OF UNITS WAS MADE.

This prospectus  supplements  the Incentive Stock Plan prospectus  dated October
14,  1998,  as may be  amended  from  time  to  time,  which  should  be read in
conjunction with this  prospectus.  To the extent of any  inconsistency  between
this prospectus and the Incentive Stock Plan  prospectus,  this prospectus shall
control. The text of the Plan is set forth below.

Employee,  such Units entitling the Key Employee to receive Company Stock at the
end of a three year restriction  period or other restriction period permitted by
the Committee, to the extent provided herein.

Units shall be equal to (a) the product of (I) the Dividend Amount, and (ii) the
number of whole and  fractional  Elective  Units  credited to the  Participant's
Account as of the Dividend Record Date,  divided by (b) the Dividend  Conversion
Price.

    ---------------------------------------
dividend  is paid on the  Company's  Stock,  a  Participant's  Account  shall be

retroactive to the Dividend Record Date. The amount of such  additional  Premium
Units shall be equal to (a) the product of (I) the Dividend Amount, and (ii) the

Fair Market Value of the Company's Stock on such date.

7.3  VOLUNTARY  DEFERRAL.  Upon such terms and  conditions  as the Committee may
     -------------------
determine,  a Participant  may be permitted to elect,  by written  notice to the
Plan Administrator  filed by the date and on such form or other authorization as
the  Plan  Administrator  may  require,  to  defer  the  issuance  hereunder  of
certificates for shares of Stock pursuant to the Plan, or such other arrangement
maintained  by the  Company,  if any,  in which the  Participant  is eligible to
participate  as of such date.  Such election  shall have the effect of deferring
such issuance  until the date permitted by the Plan  Administrator,  and/or such
other effect as permitted by the Committee.

7.4 CHANGE OF CONTROL. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, upon the
    -----------------
occurrence  of a Change of  Control,  any  Premium  Units then  credited to each

credited to the Participant's  Account plus the  Participant's  vested whole and
fractional  Premium Units,  multiplied by the "Formula  Price",  as such term is

the laws of the United States.

9.11  SEVERABILITY  OF  PROVISIONS.  If any  provision of the Plan shall be held
      ----------------------------
invalid or unenforceable,  such invalidity or unenforceability  shall not affect
any other provisions  hereof, and the Plan shall be construed and enforced as if
such invalid or unenforceable provisions had not been included herein.

                              FEDERAL TAX TREATMENT

The following is a brief summary of the U. S. Federal income tax consequences of
the award of Units and the  subsequent  receipt of Common  Stock  under the Plan
based upon the  Federal  tax laws and rules in effect on the date  hereof.  This
summary is not  exhaustive  and does not  describe  state,  local or foreign tax
consequences.  Each Plan  participant  should consult his or her tax advisor for
precise advice on his or her particular circumstances.

A participant will not recognize income on that portion of compensation  that is
exchanged  for Units,  and the  Company,  therefore,  will not be  entitled to a
deduction.  However,  after the restriction  period on the Units ends and Common
Stock is issued to a participant (unless a participant further defers receipt of
Common Stock, if eligible to do so), the  participant  will be subject to tax at
ordinary  income  rates on the fair market value of the Common Stock on the date
that the stock is  distributed  and the capital gain or loss holding  period for
such stock will also  commence on that date.  The Company  will be entitled to a
deduction in the amount that is taxable as ordinary income to the participant.


                               PARTICIPANT STATUS

CREDITOR OF THE COMPANY
-----------------------

Upon the award of Units,  the Company will place into a trust (the  "Trust") the
shares of Common Stock that may be issued to a participant after the restriction
period on Units  ends.  However,  participants  will not be named  beneficiaries
under the Trust and will not have any  specific  rights  under the Trust.  Until
shares of Common Stock are issued to a participant,  he or she will be a general
creditor of the  Company as to his or her  contractual  right to receive  Common
Stock, as represented by Units.

STOCKHOLDER STATUS
------------------

The  trustee  ("Trustee")  of the Trust  will be the legal  owner and  holder of
record of the shares of Common  Stock  underlying  Units.  Therefore,  except as
described  below or as  otherwise  provided  under the Plan,  participants  will
neither be stockholders of the Company nor have any stockholder rights by virtue
of being awarded  Units.  After the Unit  restriction  period ends, and unless a
participant  further  defers  receipt of Common  Stock (if eligible to do so), a
participant  will receive  shares of Common Stock  represented by Units and will
thereby become a stockholder of the Company and have all stockholder rights.


VOTING RIGHTS
-------------

Notwithstanding  the above,  each  participant  may direct the Trustee as to the
manner  in which  Common  Stock  underlying  Units  credited  to his or her Plan
account  shall be voted on all matters as to which the  holders of Common  Stock
are entitled to vote. Each  participant will be furnished with a proxy statement
or other solicitation  document prior to any stockholder meeting of the Company,
along with a form (which may be a Company  proxy card) to allow the  participant
to instruct the Trustee on voting the Common Stock  underlying Units credited to
a participant's Plan account as of the meeting record date.

The Trustee will vote the shares of Common Stock as instructed by  participants.
In lieu  of  voting  fractional  shares,  the  Trustee  may  vote  the  combined
fractional shares to the extent possible to reflect participants'  instructions.
The Trustee will vote shares of Common  Stock as to which no valid  instructions
were  given in the same  manner  and  proportion  as the  shares as to which the
Trustee has received valid instructions


DIVIDENDS
---------

The Company may, from time to time, declare and pay a cash dividend ("Dividend")
to the holders of shares of Common  Stock.  As more fully set forth in the Plan,
Dividends  payable  upon  shares  underlying  Units  will  not  be  credited  to
participants' Plan accounts in the form of cash, but instead will be credited as
reinvested in additional full and/or fractional Units ("Reinvested  Units"). The
effect on Units of any stock dividend or stock split  distributed by the Company
on shares of Common  Stock,  or other  corporate  actions  affecting  the Common
Stock,  will be  determined  by the  Committee.  To the  extent  that  any  such
corporate  action results in additional  Units being credited to a participant's
account, subsequent Dividends relating to these Units will also be in Reinvested
Units.

                               RESALE RESTRICTIONS

As set forth in the Plan, participants have no right to receive shares of Common
Stock  until  the  restriction  period  on  Units  ends.  The Plan  contains  no
restrictions  on the resale of Common  Stock issued to  participants  after such
restriction period ends. However,  affiliates of the Company,  which may include
directors and certain officers of the Company,  may not reoffer or resell shares
of Common Stock in a transaction  which is not  registered  under the Securities
Act except pursuant to Rule 144 under such Act or another exemption  thereunder.
Rule 144 requires,  among other things, that (1) any sales of Common Stock by an
affiliate  must be through a broker,  and (2) SEC Form 144 must be mailed to the
SEC prior to or concurrently with the placing of a sell order with the broker if
the amount  sold  during any three  month  period  exceeds  500 shares or has an
aggregate sale price of more than $10,000.
