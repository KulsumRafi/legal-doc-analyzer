         REORGANIZING DEBTORS' JOINT PLAN OF REORGANIZATION PURSUANT TO
                 CHAPTER 11 OF THE UNITED STATES BANKRUPTCY CODE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

         Pursuant to Title 11 of the United States Code, 11 U.S.C. ss.ss. 101 et
seq., the Debtors and Debtors in Possession in the above-captioned and numbered
cases, hereby respectfully propose the following Joint Plan of Reorganization
under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code:

                                   Article I.

                     DEFINED TERMS, RULES OF INTERPRETATION,
                      COMPUTATION OF TIME AND GOVERNING LAW

A.      Rules of Interpretation, Computation of Time and Governing Law

         1.   For purposes herein: (a) whenever from the context it is
appropriate, each term, whether stated in the singular or the plural, shall
include both the singular and the plural, and pronouns stated in the masculine,
feminine or neuter gender shall include the masculine, feminine and the neuter
gender; (b) any reference herein to a contract, instrument, release, indenture
or other agreement or document being in a particular form or on particular terms
and conditions means that such document shall be substantially in such form or
substantially on such terms and conditions; (c) any reference herein to an
existing document or exhibit Filed, or to be Filed, shall mean such document or
exhibit, as it may have been or may be amended, modified or supplemented; (d)
unless otherwise specified, all references herein to Sections and Articles are
references to Sections and Articles hereof or hereto; (e) the words "herein,"
"hereof" and "hereto" refer to the Plan in its entirety rather than to a
particular portion of this Plan; (f) captions and headings to Articles and
Sections are inserted for convenience of reference only and are not intended to
be a part of or to affect the interpretation hereof; (g) the rules of
construction set forth in section 102 of the Bankruptcy Code shall apply; and
(h) any term used in capitalized form herein that is not otherwise defined but
that is used in the Bankruptcy Code or the Bankruptcy Rules shall have the
meaning assigned to such term in the Bankruptcy Code or the Bankruptcy Rules, as
the case may be.

         2.    In computing any period of time prescribed or allowed hereby, the
provisions of Bankruptcy Rule 9006(a) shall apply.

         3.    Except to the extent that the Bankruptcy Code or Bankruptcy Rules
are applicable, and subject to the provisions of any contract, instrument,
release, indenture or other agreement or document entered into in connection
herewith, the rights and obligations arising hereunder shall be governed by, and
construed and enforced in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York,
without giving effect to the principles of conflict of laws thereof.

B.       Proponents of Plan

         This Plan is proposed by the Reorganizing Debtors. The classification
and treatment of Claims and Equity Interests against the Reorganizing Debtors is
contained in Article III.

C.       Severability of Plan Provisions

         1.    The Plan is comprised of four subplans of reorganization. The
confirmation requirements of section 1129 of the Bankruptcy Code must be
satisfied separately with respect to each subplan. If any subplan is not
confirmed, the Debtors reserve the right, with the prior written consent of the
Conseco Creditors Committee, to either (a) request that the other subplans be
confirmed or (b) withdraw some or all subplans; provided that (i) the subplan
for CIHC may not be confirmed unless the subplan for CNC is confirmed and (ii)
the subplan for CNC may not be confirmed unless the subplan for CIHC is
confirmed. Subject to the preceding provision, the Debtors' inability to confirm
or election to withdraw any subplan(s) shall not impair the confirmation of any
other subplan(s).


<PAGE>

D.       Substantive Consolidation

         The estates of the Debtors have not been substantively consolidated.
The Claims held solely against one of the Debtors will be satisfied solely from
the cash and assets of such Debtor except as provided for herein. Except as
specifically set forth herein, nothing in this Plan or the Disclosure Statement
shall constitute or be deemed to constitute an admission that one of the Debtors
is subject to or liable for any Claim against any other Debtor. Except as
specifically set forth herein, the Claims of Creditors that hold Claims against
multiple Debtors will be treated as separate Claims with respect to each
Debtor's estate for all purposes (including, but not limited to, distributions
and voting), and such Claims will be administered as provided in the Plan. Any
Claims against any Debtor will be satisfied according to the terms of the Plan.

E.       Defined Terms

the following meanings when used in capitalized form herein:

terms summarized in the 93/94 Notes Term Sheet as found in the Plan Supplement.

          4.   Employment Agreements

          On the Effective Date, New CNC shall enter into the Senior Management

          5.   Resolution of the Directors & Officers Stock Purchase Program for
               Certain Participants

                                       32
<PAGE>
          Within fifteen (15) days after the Effective Date, New CNC and
Reorganized CIHC shall take the following actions with respect to the
individuals and entities (each a "Participant" and collectively, the
"Participants") that (i) owe amounts under the D&O Credit Facilities or to New
CNC and Reorganized CIHC pursuant to the various directors, officers and key
employees stock purchase programs (the "Stock Programs") and (ii) purchased
40,000 or less shares of Conseco, Inc. common stock pursuant to the Stock
Programs and owe amounts under the D&O Credit Facilities or to New CNC and
Reorganized CIHC as part of the Stock Programs:

               (a) New CNC and Reorganized CIHC, in settlement of any good faith
          claims(2) such Participant may have in any manner relating to the D&O
          Credit Facilities, the Stock Programs, or any Work-Down Plan, shall
          offer a Purchase Price Adjustment Agreement substantially in the form
          attached as Exhibit J to the Disclosure Statement (the "Adjustment
          Agreement") to such Participant pursuant to which (i) the
          Participant's initial loan amounts shall be reduced to an amount equal
          to an agreeable price(3) per share for the shares purchased by such
          Participant (the "Adjusted Purchase Amount"), and (ii) New CNC and
          Reorganized CIHC shall cause their affiliate Conseco Services, LLC
          ("LLC") to execute the Adjustment Agreement and to reduce any loans
          such Participant owes to LLC related to the D&O Credit Facilities
          and/or the Stock Programs to an amount calculated on an agreeable
          price per share for the shares purchased by such Participant (the
          "Adjusted Interest Amount"); provided, however, that under the
          Adjustment Agreement:

                      (i)   Participant shall (A) pay to New CNC the Adjusted
                Purchase Amount and (B) pay to LLC the Adjusted Interest Amount
                within 90 days after the Participant signs the Adjustment
                Agreement, but if payment is not made on such date, Participant
                shall owe (A) New CNC 4% per annum simple interest on the
                Adjusted Purchase Amount, accruing as of the 91st day, and (B)
                LLC 4% per annum simple interest on the Adjusted Interest
                Amount, accruing as of the 91st day.

                      (ii)  Participant releases New CNC, Reorganized CIHC, the
                original lenders under the D&O Credit Facilities (and their
                successors and assigns), their respective affiliates, and the
                respective officers, directors, employees, agents (including
                financial consultants) and attorneys of the original lenders
                under the D&O Credit Facilities (and of their successors and
                assigns) (collectively, the "SP Releasees") from any and all
                claims the Participant may have with respect to the D&O Credit
                Facilities, his or her participation in the Stock Programs or
                any Work-Down Plan, and/or this Plan, but Participant reserves
                all rights against the Ineligible Persons (defined in paragraph
                c. below) and all others (other than the SP Releasees) who were
                involved in the D&O Credit Facilities and/or the Stock Programs
                (such others (other than the SP Releasees) together with the
                Ineligible Persons, the "Non-Released Entities") and waives no
                causes of action, setoffs, claims, rights, defenses, powers,
                and/or remedies (or similar matters), whether under the
                pertinent loan documents, applicable law or otherwise, against
                the Non-Released Entities and/or the Non-Released Entities'
                past, present or future property (including any such property
                that may be in the hands of any immediate or mediate
                transferee), all regardless of whether New CNC or Reorganized
                CIHC asserts or exercises (or does not assert or exercise, as
                the case may be) similar causes of action, setoffs, claims,
                rights, defenses and/or remedies (or similar matters) (in any
                combination) against any other person or entity.

                      (iii) Upon Participant's payment of (A) the Adjusted
                Purchase Amount to New CNC and (B) the Adjusted Interest Amount
                to LLC, New CNC, Reorganized CIHC, and LLC and their respective
                affiliates shall release the Participant from any claims with
                respect to the D&O Credit Facilities, Stock Programs or any
                Work-Down Plan, but New CNC, Reorganized CIHC and LLC (A) waive
                no other causes of action, setoffs, claims, rights, defenses,
                powers, and/or remedies (or

--------------------
2    Pursuant to an order entered on February 19, 2003, the claims bar date for
     Participants is 60 days after the Effective Date. As of the date this
     amended Plan was filed with the Bankruptcy Court, it appears that very few
     Participants have filed a proof of claim against any Reorganizing Debtor.
     Any Participant who executes an Adjustment Agreement will release his or
     her claims against the Reorganizing Debtors related to the D&O Credit
     Facilities, Stock Programs and any Work-Down Plan.

3    New CNC and Reorganized CIHC shall negotiate with each Participant an
     agreeable price per share unique to such Participant. New CNC and
     Reorganized CIHC shall not be obliged to offer the same price to all
     Participants.


                                       33
<PAGE>

               similar matters) against Participant and (B) New CNC, Reorganized
               CIHC and LLC reserve all rights against Non-Released Entities (as
               defined in paragraph a.2. above) and waive no causes of action,
               setoffs, claims, rights, defenses, powers, and/or remedies (or
               similar matters), whether under the pertinent loan documents,
               applicable law or otherwise, against the Non-Released Entities
               and/or the Non-Released Entities' past, present or future
               property (including any such property that may be in the hands of
               any immediate or mediate transferee), all regardless of whether
               New CNC or Reorganized CIHC asserts or exercises (or does not
               assert or exercise, as the case may be) similar causes of action,
               setoffs, claims, rights, defenses and/or remedies (or similar
               matters) (in any combination) against any other person or entity.

                      (iv)  Participant assigns to New CNC his or her rights
                against the Non-Released Entities (as defined in paragraph
                (a)(ii) above).

          The Adjustment Agreement annexed as Exhibit J to the Disclosure
Statement shall be executed on an individualized basis by the Reorganized
Debtors and Participants that are offered it and choose to sign it and, in
addition to the other restrictions set forth herein, no Participant shall be
entitled to the benefits of the Adjustment Agreement absent such execution and
delivery of the Adjustment Agreement. Participants who are offered the
Adjustment Agreement may choose to decline to sign it, but in such event, any
such declining Participants shall become Ineligible Persons (defined in
paragraph c. below).

          The Debtors have determined based on several different business and
legal considerations to offer an Adjustment Agreement to such Participant
subject to the foregoing conditions, and their decision to do so shall in no
manner be deemed to be an admission by either of them (or by any other Person)
as to the accuracy of any factual statement or legal theory underlying any such
good faith claims on the part of any such Participant or any other borrower
under the D&O Credit Facilities, but on the contrary, the Debtors deny the legal
validity or enforceability of any such claims or defenses and expressly reserves
any and all of their claims, defenses, rights, powers and/or remedies against
any such Participant in the event that this Plan is not confirmed and against
Ineligible Persons, whether or not this Plan is confirmed. The decision to offer
an Adjustment Agreement to a Participant under the terms and conditions of this
Article V.F.5.a has been made in connection with and is a part of this Plan and,
as such, is independent of and is expressly not a renewal or extension of any
Work-Down Plan, and shall not be deemed to be a renewal or extension of any
Work-Down Plan under any circumstances.

                (b) Pursuant to Article III.C.4.(c) of this Plan, New CNC shall
          succeed to the lenders' right, title and interest in the loans
          underlying the D&O Credit Facilities.

                (c) The following are ineligible to be offered an Adjustment
          Agreement (collectively, "Ineligible Persons"): (i) persons or
          entities that purchased more than 40,000 shares of Conseco, Inc.
          common stock and owe amounts under the D&O Credit Facilities or to New
          CNC or Reorganized CIHC as part of the Stock Programs, (ii)
          Participants who are offered an Adjustment Agreement under paragraph
          a. above but who, for whatever reason, refuse to sign an Adjustment
          Agreement, and (ii) Participants who are not offered an Adjustment
          Agreement under paragraph d. below.

                (d) Notwithstanding Section F.5.a. above, New CNC and
          Reorganized CIHC may choose not to offer an Adjustment Agreement to
          any Participant who purchased 40,000 or less shares who New CNC and
          Reorganized CIHC reasonably believe directed and/or authorized (1) the
          implementation of the Stock Program, (2) the number of shares (or
          aggregate purchase price) of Conseco, Inc. common stock to be
          purchased in the aggregate pursuant to the Stock Program and/or (3)
          the selection of individuals eligible to participate in the Stock
          Program and/or their permitted level of participation. The fact that a
          Participant is or is not a current employee of New CNC, Reorganized
          CIHC or any affiliate shall not be a factor in determining whether New
          CNC and Reorganized CIHC offer a Participant an Adjustment Agreement.

          6.    Listing/Registration Rights

          On the Effective Date, New CNC shall (a) be a reporting company under
the Exchange Act, (b) cause the shares of New CNC Preferred Stock, New CNC
Common Stock and New CNC Warrants to be listed on [ ] or

                                       34
<PAGE>

such other securities exchange as agreed with the Official Unsecured Committee,
if the listing requirements for such securities exchange are satisfied with
respect to such securities, and (c) execute and deliver a Registration Rights
Agreement substantially in the form set forth in the Plan Supplement.

          7.    Corporate Action

          On the Effective Date, the adoption and filing of the New CNC Charter
and New CNC By-laws, the appointment of directors and officers for the
Reorganized Debtors, the adoption of the Management Incentive Plan, and all
actions contemplated hereby shall be authorized and approved in all respects
(subject to the provisions hereof) pursuant to this Plan. All matters provided
for herein involving the corporate structure of the Debtors or Reorganizing
Debtors, and any corporate action required by the Debtors or Reorganizing
Debtors in connection with the Plan, shall be deemed to have occurred and shall
be in effect, without any requirement of further action by the security holders
or directors of the Debtors or Reorganized Debtors. On the Effective Date, the
appropriate officers of the Reorganized Debtors and members of the board of
directors of the Reorganized Debtors are authorized and directed to issue,
execute and deliver the agreements, documents, securities and instruments
contemplated by the Plan in the name of and on behalf of the Reorganized Debtors
without the need for any required approvals, authorizations or consents except
for express consents required under this Plan.

J.        Sources of Cash for Plan Distribution

          All Cash necessary for the Reorganizing Debtors and Reorganized
Debtors to make payments pursuant hereto shall be obtained from existing Cash
balances of the Debtors.

K.        Retiree Benefits

          The Reorganizing Debtors shall timely pay any retiree benefits as
defined in Section 1114(a) of the Bankruptcy Code to the extent that such
retiree benefits are payable by the Reorganizing Debtors. Such retiree benefits
include those that arise from the plans, funds or programs described in the Plan
Supplement.

L.        GM Building Sale

          The sale or transfer of the GM Building (or entities owning the GM
Building or interests therein) pursuant to or consistent with a Final Order of
the Bankruptcy Court shall be deemed a transfer under, pursuant to and in
furtherance of this Plan.

                                  Article VI.

                        TREATMENT OF EXECUTORY CONTRACTS
                              AND UNEXPIRED LEASES

A.        Executory Contracts and Unexpired Leases

          Immediately prior to the Effective Date, except as otherwise provided
herein, all executory contracts including, without limitation, the prepetition
engagement letters for the financial and legal advisors to the Unofficial Bank
Committee and the Unofficial Noteholder Committee, respectively, or unexpired
leases of the Reorganizing Debtors will be deemed assumed in accordance with the
provisions and requirements of sections 365 and 1123 of the Bankruptcy Code
except those executory contracts and unexpired leases that (1) have been
rejected by order of the Bankruptcy Court, (2) have previously been assumed by
order of the Bankruptcy Court,4 (3) are the subject of a motion to reject
pending on the Effective Date, (4) are identified in the Plan Supplement to be
rejected, or (5) relate to the purchase or other acquisition of Equity
Interests. Entry of the Confirmation Order by the Bankruptcy Court shall
constitute approval of such assumptions and rejections pursuant to sections
365(a) and 1123 of the Bankruptcy Code.

------------------


                                       35
<PAGE>


B.        Claims Based on Rejection of Executory Contracts or Unexpired Leases

          All Proofs of Claims with respect to Claims arising from the rejection
of executory contracts or unexpired leases, if any, must be Filed with the
Bankruptcy Court within thirty (30) days after the date of entry of an order of
the Bankruptcy Court approving such rejection. Any Claims arising from the
rejection of an executory contract or unexpired lease not Filed within such time
will be forever barred from assertion against any Debtor or Reorganized Debtor,
any Estate, or property of any Debtor or Reorganized Debtor, unless otherwise
ordered by the Bankruptcy Court. All Allowed Claims arising from the rejection
of executory contracts or unexpired leases of the Reorganizing Debtor will be
classified as Reorganizing Debtor General Unsecured Claims.

C.        Cure of Defaults for Executory Contracts and Unexpired Leases Assumed

          Any monetary amounts by which each executory contract and unexpired
lease to be assumed pursuant to the Plan is in default shall be satisfied,
pursuant to section 365(b)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code, by payment of the default
amount in Cash on the Effective Date, or as soon thereafter as is practicable,
or on such other terms as the parties to such executory contracts or unexpired
leases may otherwise agree. In the event of a dispute regarding: (1) the amount
of any cure payments, (2) the ability of the relevant Reorganized Debtor or any
assignee to provide "adequate assurance of future performance" (within the
meaning of section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code) under the contract or lease to be
assumed, or (3) any other matter pertaining to assumption, the cure payments
required by section 365(b)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code shall be made following the
entry of a Final Order resolving the dispute and approving the assumption. Ten
days before the Confirmation Hearing, the Debtors will contact relevant contract
counterparties with the Stated Cure Amounts (if any) for all executory contracts
and unexpired leases to be assumed pursuant to the Plan.

D.        Indemnification of Directors, Officers and Employees

          The obligations of any of the Debtors to indemnify any Person serving
at any time on or prior to the Effective Date as one of its directors, officers
or employees by reason of such Person's service in such capacity, or as a
director, officer or employee of any other corporation or legal entity, to the
extent provided in such Debtor's constitutive documents, by a written agreement
with such Debtor or under applicable state corporate law (to the maximum extent
permitted thereunder), shall be deemed and treated as executory contracts that
are assumed by the relevant Reorganized Debtor (it being understood that New CNC
is the relevant Reorganized Debtor of CNC) pursuant hereto and section 365 of
the Bankruptcy Code as of the Effective Date. Accordingly, such indemnification
obligations shall survive Unimpaired and unaffected by entry of the Confirmation
Order, irrespective of whether such indemnification is owed for an act or event
occurring before or after the Petition Date.

E.       Compensation and Benefit Programs

         Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all employment and
severance agreements and policies, and all compensation and benefit plans,
policies, and programs of the Debtors applicable to their respective employees,
former employees, retirees and non-employee directors and the employees, former
employees and retirees of its subsidiaries, including, without limitation, all
savings plans, retirement plans, health care plans, disability plans, severance
benefit agreements and plans, incentive plans, deferred compensation plans and
life, accidental death and dismemberment insurance plans shall be treated as
executory contracts under the Plan and on the Effective Date shall be deemed
assumed pursuant to the provisions of sections 365 and 1123 of the Bankruptcy
Code; and the Debtors' obligations under such programs to Persons shall survive
confirmation of this Plan, except for (i) executory contracts or employee
benefit plans specifically rejected pursuant to this Plan (to the extent such
rejection does not violate sections 1114 and 1129(a)(13) of the Bankruptcy
Code), (ii) all employee equity or equity-based incentive plans, and (iii) such
executory contracts or employee benefit plans as have previously been rejected,
are the subject of a motion to reject as of the Confirmation Date, or have been
specifically waived by the beneficiaries of any employee benefit plan or
contract; provided however, that the Debtors' obligations, if any, to pay all
"retiree benefits" as defined in section 1114(a) of the Bankruptcy Code shall
continue.

                                       36
<PAGE>

F.        Assumption of D&O Insurance

          All directors' and officers' liability insurance policies maintained
by the Debtors are hereby assumed. Entry of the order confirming the Plan by the
clerk of the Bankruptcy Court shall constitute approval of such assumptions
pursuant to section 365(a) of the Bankruptcy Code. The Reorganized Debtors shall
maintain for a period not less than 10 years from the Effective Date coverage
for the individuals covered, as of the Petition Date, by such policies at levels
and on terms no less favorable to such individuals than the terms and levels
provided for under the policies assumed pursuant to the Plan. Solely with
respect to directors and officers of any of the Debtors who served in such
capacity at any time on or after the Petition Date, the Debtors shall be deemed
to assume, as of the Effective Date, their respective obligations to indemnify
such individuals (and only such individuals) with respect to or based upon any
act or omission taken or omitted in any of such capacities, or for or on behalf
of any Debtor, pursuant to and to the extent provided by the Debtors' respective
articles of incorporation, certificates of formation, corporate charters,
bylaws, and similar corporate documents as in effect as of the date of entry of
the Confirmation Order. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, such assumed indemnity obligations shall not be discharged, Impaired, or
otherwise modified by confirmation of this Plan and shall be deemed and treated
as executory contracts that have been assumed by the Debtors pursuant to this
Plan as to which no proofs of claim need be Filed.

                                  Article VII.

                       PROVISIONS GOVERNING DISTRIBUTIONS

A.        Distributions for Claims and Equity Interests Allowed as of the
          Effective Date

          Except as otherwise provided herein or as may be ordered by the
Bankruptcy Court, distributions to be made on the Effective Date on account of
Claims and Equity Interests that are Allowed as of the Effective Date and are
entitled to receive distributions under the Plan shall be made on the Effective
Date or as soon as practicable thereafter.

          For purposes of determining the accrual of interest, dividends or
rights in respect of any other payment from and after the Effective Date, the
New Tranche A Bank Debt, the New Tranche B Bank Debt, the New Senior Notes, New
CNC Preferred Stock, New CNC Warrants and New CNC Common Stock shall be deemed
issued as of the Effective Date regardless of the date on which they are
actually dated, authenticated or distributed; provided that, the respective
Reorganized Debtor shall withhold any actual payment until such distribution is
made.

B.        Distributions by the Distribution Agent(s)

          The Debtors shall have the authority, in their sole discretion, to
enter into agreements with one or more Distribution Agents, to facilitate the
solicitation of votes on the Reorganizing Subplans and distributions required
under the Reorganizing Subplans. As a condition to serving as a Distribution
Agent, a Distribution Agent must (i) affirm its obligation to facilitate the
prompt distribution of any documents or solicitation materials, (ii) affirm its
obligation to facilitate the prompt distribution of any recoveries or
distributions required under the Reorganizing Subplan at issue, and (iii) waive
any right or ability to setoff against, deduct from, or assert any lien or
encumbrance against the distributions required under the Reorganizing Subplan
that are to be distributed by such Distribution Agent. In consideration for
waiving its rights to setoff, deduct from or assert any lien or encumbrance
against such distributions, the Debtors shall pay all reasonable fees and
expenses (whether prepetition or postpetition) of such Distribution Agent. The
Distribution Agent shall submit detailed invoices to the Debtors for all fees
and expenses for which the Distribution Agent seeks reimbursement. The Debtors,
upon review of such invoices, shall pay those amounts the Debtors, in their sole
discretion, deem reasonable, and shall object in writing to those fees and
expenses, if any, that the Debtors deem to be unreasonable. In the event that
the Debtors object to all or any portion of a Distribution Agent's invoice, the
Debtors and such Distribution Agent will endeavor, in good faith, to reach
mutual agreement on the amount of such disputed fees and/or expenses. In the
event that the Debtors and a Distribution Agent are unable to resolve any
differences regarding disputed fees or expenses, either party shall be
authorized to move to have such dispute heard by the Bankruptcy Court.

C. Delivery and Distributions and Undeliverable or Unclaimed Distributions

          1.   Delivery of Distributions in General

          Distributions to Holders of Allowed Claims and Allowed Equity
Interests shall be made to the Holders of such Allowed Claims and Allowed Equity
Interests as of the Distribution Record Date. Except as otherwise provided
herein, distributions to Holders of Allowed Claims and Allowed Equity Interests
shall be made at the address of the Holder of such Claim or Equity Interest as
indicated on the records of the Debtors as of the date that such distribution is
made.

          2.   Undeliverable Distributions

               (a)  Holding of Undeliverable Distributions

          If any distribution to a Holder of an Allowed Claim or Allowed Equity
Interest is returned to a Distribution Agent as undeliverable, no further
distributions shall be made to such Holder unless and until such Distribution
Agent is notified in writing of such Holder's then-current address.
Undeliverable distributions shall remain in the possession of such Distribution
Agent subject to Subsection (b) below until such time as a distribution becomes
deliverable. Undeliverable Cash shall not be entitled to any interest, dividends
or other accruals of any kind. As soon as reasonably practicable, a Distribution
Agent shall make all distributions that become deliverable.

               (b)  Failure to Claim Undeliverable Distributions

          In an effort to ensure that all Holders of Allowed Claims and Equity
Interests receive their allocated distributions, ninety (90) days after the
Effective Date, the Reorganized Debtors will file with the Bankruptcy Court a
listing of unclaimed distributions. This list will be maintained for as long as
the Chapter 11 Cases stay open. Any Holder of an Allowed Claim or Equity
Interest (irrespective of when a Claim or Equity Interest became an Allowed
Claim or Equity Interest) that does not assert a Claim or Equity Interest
pursuant hereto for an undeliverable distribution (regardless of when not
deliverable) within two years after the Effective Date shall have its Claim or
Equity Interest for such undeliverable distribution discharged and shall be
forever barred from asserting any such Claim or Equity Interest against the
relevant Reorganized Debtor or its property. In such cases: (i) any Cash held
for distribution on account of such Claims or Equity Interests shall be property
of the relevant Reorganized Debtor free of any restrictions thereon; and (ii)
any securities issued hereunder held for distribution on account of such Claims
or Equity Interests shall be canceled and of no further force or effect. Nothing
contained herein shall require any Reorganized Debtor or any Distribution Agent
to attempt to locate any Holder of an Allowed Claim or Allowed Equity Interest.

          3.   Compliance with Tax Requirements/Allocations

          In connection with the Plan, to the extent applicable, each
Reorganizing Debtor, Reorganized Debtor and Distribution Agent shall comply with
all tax withholding and reporting requirements imposed on it by any governmental
unit, and all distributions pursuant hereto shall be subject to such withholding
and reporting requirements. Each Reorganizing Debtor, Reorganized Debtor and
Distribution Agent shall be authorized to take all actions necessary or
appropriate to comply with such withholding and reporting requirements. For tax
purposes, distributions received in respect of Allowed Claims will be allocated
first to the principal amount of Allowed Claims, with any excess allocated to
unpaid interest that accrued on such Claims.

D.        Timing and Calculation of Amounts to be Distributed

          On the Effective Date or as soon as practicable thereafter, each
Holder of an Allowed Claim against or Allowed Equity Interest in the Debtors
shall receive the full amount of the distributions that the Plan provides for
Allowed Claims or Allowed Equity Interests in the applicable Class. If and to
the extent that there are Disputed Claims or Disputed Equity Interests,
distributions on account of such Disputed Claims or Equity Interests shall be
made pursuant to the provisions set forth in Article IX.A.3.

                                       38

E.        Minimum Distribution

          Any other provision of the Plan notwithstanding, payments of fractions
of shares of New CNC Common Stock or New CNC Preferred Stock or fractions of New
CNC Warrants will not be made and will be deemed to be zero. Any other provision
of the Plan notwithstanding, the Reorganized Debtors or a Distribution Agent
will not be required to make distributions or payments of fractions of dollars.
Whenever any payment of a fraction of a dollar under the Plan would otherwise be
called for, the actual payment will reflect a rounding of such fraction to the
nearest whole dollar (up or down), with half dollars or less being rounded down.

F.        Claims Between Finance Company Debtors and Reorganizing Debtors

          As of the Petition Date CFC owed CIHC $277,376,671 under a promissory
note (the "CFC/CIHC Intercompany Note"), and CIHC owed CFC $315,030,986 under a
separate note (the "CIHC/CFC Intercompany Note"). The net pre-petition balance
owing by CIHC to CFC under those two notes is $37,654,315 (the "Pre-Petition
Note Balance"). CIHC holds other pre-petition claims against CFC. In addition,
on and after the Petition Date, CIHC has funded certain expenses incurred on
behalf of the Finance Company Debtors (the "Advanced Funds"). Certain first day
orders entered in the Reorganizing Debtors' and Finance Company Debtors' jointly
administered bankruptcy cases may entitle one or more of the Reorganizing
Debtors to a super-priority administrative claim in the Finance Company Debtors'
cases.

          Except as expressly provided for herein, each Reorganizing Debtor and
Reorganized Debtor may, as the case may be, pursuant to the Bankruptcy Code
(including, without limitation, section 553) or applicable non-bankruptcy law or
as may be agreed to by the Holder of a Claim, set off against any Allowed Claim
or Equity Interest and the distributions to be made pursuant hereto on account
of such Allowed Claim or Equity Interest (before any distribution is made on
account of such Allowed Claim or Equity Interest), any Claims, Equity Interests,
rights and Causes of Action of any nature that such Reorganizing Debtor or
Reorganized Debtor, as the case may be, may hold against the Holder of such
Allowed Claim or Equity Interest to the extent the Claims, Equity Interests,
rights or Causes of Action against such Holder have not been compromised or
settled on or prior to the Effective Date (whether pursuant to the Plan or
otherwise); provided that, neither the failure to effect such a setoff nor the
allowance of any Claim or Equity Interest hereunder shall constitute a waiver or
release by such Reorganizing Debtor or Reorganized Debtor of any such Claims,
Equity Interests, rights and Causes of Action that such Reorganizing Debtor or
Reorganized Debtor may possess against such Holder.

          Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, on the Effective
Date, prior to effectuating the distributions contemplated by this Plan, the
CIHC/CFC Intercompany Note and any other Claims CFC may hold against CIHC shall
be offset against (i) the CFC/CIHC Intercompany Note, (ii) all other prepetition
amounts owed by CFC and (iii) all postpetition amounts owed by CFC that are not
repaid in full in Cash by CFC, including, without limitation, health and welfare
benefits, insurance, other direct CFC expenses and an appropriate allocation
(which allocation will be filed by the Reorganizing Debtors 10 days prior to the
Confirmation Hearing) of the postpetition professional fees paid by CIHC, except
to the extent that prior to Confirmation, the Bankruptcy Court determines by
Final Order that such setoff or treatment may not be allowed under applicable
law (including the Bankruptcy Code). Any balance of the CIHC/CFC Intercompany
Note remaining after giving effect to all the setoffs in the preceding sentence
(the "Net CFC Claims") will be Class 6B Claims.

          In addition, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of
the Reorganizing Debtors shall offset against Claims by any of the Finance
Company Debtors all (x) prepetition Claims owing by the Finance Company Debtors
to the Reorganizing Debtors, including without limitation, (i) amounts owing
under the prepetition tax sharing payments, (ii) amounts owing as a result of
payments made on behalf of the Finance Company Debtors to ExlServices.com, Inc.
("Exl"), (iii) an appropriate allocation of prepetition professional fees
incurred by the Reorganizing Debtors and Finance Company Debtors in connection
with their restructuring and the preparation for these Chapter 11 Cases, (iv)
prepetition amounts owing by the Finance Company Debtors to Conseco Services or
CIHC, and (y) postpetition amounts owing by the Finance Company Debtors to the
Reorganizing Debtors that are not repaid in full in Cash, including without
limitation, (i) postpetition tax sharing payments owed by the Finance Company
Debtors, (ii) an appropriate allocation of the postpetition professional fees
incurred by the Reorganizing

                                       39
<PAGE>
Debtors during these Chapter 11 Cases, (iii) any postpetition payments by the
Reorganizing Debtors to Exl pursuant to the guarantee by CNC of a transition
services agreement between Exl and CFC, and (iv) postpetition amounts owed by
the Finance Company Debtors to Conseco Services or CIHC, except to the extent
that prior to Confirmation, the Bankruptcy Court determines by Final Order that
such setoff or treatment may not be allowed under applicable law (including the
Bankruptcy Code). Claims (if any) of Finance Company Debtors against
Reorganizing Debtors that continue to be outstanding after such offsets as well
as any Net CFC Claims are referred to herein collectively as "Net Finance
Company Debtors' Claims." To the extent any Net Finance Company Debtors' Claims
are Allowed Claims against CNC they will be Class 8A Claims. For purposes of
this Article VII.F, "Net Reorganizing Debtors' Claims" means any and all Claims
held by any of the Reorganizing Debtors or any of their affiliates against the
Finance Company Debtors after effecting any and all of the offsets described
above. Notwithstanding anything else contained herein, all such Net Reorganizing
Debtors' Claims shall be preserved and unaffected by the confirmation of the
Plan.

          On February 19, 2003, the Court entered an Order granting the Finance
Company Debtors through April 1, 2003 to file proofs of claim against the
Reorganizing Debtors. The Reorganizing Debtors have been advised by the Finance
Company Debtors that they are presently engaged in investigations to determine
the bases for, and valuation of, intercompany claims they may hold against the
Reorganizing Debtors. The Finance Company Debtors may believe that the
investigations conducted by the Finance Company Debtors will yield additional
information regarding the intercompany obligations which may necessitate
adjustments to the amounts of the Pre-Petition Note Balance, the Advanced Funds,
Net Finance Company Debtors' Claims and/or Net Reorganizing Debtors' Claims. The
Reorganizing Debtors are presently engaged in investigations to determine the
basis for, and valuation of, any additional intercompany claims that they may
hold against the Finance Company Debtors.

G.        Surrender of Canceled Instruments or Securities

          Subject to Subsection I. below, each record Holder of an Allowed Claim
or Equity Interest relating to the (i) Senior Credit Facility, (ii) CIHC
Guarantee of Senior Credit Facility, (iii) CNC Guarantee of D&O Credit
Facilities, (iv) CIHC Guarantee of D&O Credit Facilities, (v) Exchanged Notes,
(vi) Original Notes, (vii) Subordinated Debentures, (viii) CNC Common Stock, or
(ix) CNC Preferred Stock shall surrender the certificates or other documentation
underlying such Claim or Equity Interest, and all such surrendered certificates
and other documentations shall be marked as canceled.

H.        Failure to Surrender Canceled Instruments

          Any Holder of Allowed Claims or Equity Interests relating to the (i)
Senior Credit Facility, (ii) CIHC Guarantee of Senior Credit Facility, (iii) CNC
Guarantee of D&O Credit Facilities, (iv) CIHC Guarantee of D&O Credit
Facilities, (v) Exchanged Notes, (vi) Original Notes, (vii) Subordinated
Debentures, (viii) CNC Common Stock, or (ix) CNC Preferred Stock that fails to
surrender or is deemed to have failed to surrender its certificates or other
documentation representing such Claim or Equity Interest required to be tendered
hereunder within one year after the Effective Date shall have its Claim for a
distribution pursuant hereto on account of such Allowed Claim or Allowed Equity
Interests discharged and shall be forever barred from asserting any such Claim
or Equity Interest against any Reorganizing Debtor, Reorganized Debtor,
Distribution Agent or their assets.

I.        Lost, Stolen, Mutilated or Destroyed Debt Securities

          Any Holder of Allowed Claims or Equity Interests relating to the (i)
Senior Credit Facility, (ii) CIHC Guarantee of Senior Credit Facility, (iii) CNC
Guarantee of D&O Credit Facilities, (iv) CIHC Guarantee of D&O Credit
Facilities, (v) Exchanged Notes, (vi) Original Notes, (vii) Subordinated
Debentures, (viii) CNC Common Stock, or (ix) CNC Preferred Stock that is
evidenced by a note or by a stock certificate which has been lost, stolen,
mutilated or destroyed shall, in lieu of surrendering such note or stock
certificate, deliver to such relevant Distribution Agent: (a) an affidavit of
loss reasonably satisfactory to the Distribution Agent setting forth the
unavailability of the note or the stock certificate; and (b) such additional
indemnity as may reasonably be required by the Distribution Agent to hold the
Distribution Agent harmless from any damages, liabilities or costs incurred in
treating such individual as a Holder of an Allowed Claim or Equity Interest.
Upon compliance with this procedure

                                       40
<PAGE>

by a Holder of an Allowed Claim or Equity Interest evidenced by such a lost,
stolen, mutilated or destroyed note or stock certificate, such Holder shall, for
all purposes under the Plan, be deemed to have surrendered such note or
certificate.

                                 Article VIII.

                PROCEDURES FOR RESOLUTION OF DISPUTED, CONTINGENT
                   AND UNLIQUIDATED CLAIMS OR EQUITY INTERESTS

A.        Resolution of Disputed Claims

          1.   Prosecution of Objections to Claims

          After the Effective Date, the Reorganized Debtors (for Claims against
the Reorganized Debtors) shall have the exclusive authority on or before the
Claims Objection Bar Date to file objections, settle, compromise, withdraw or
litigate to judgment objections to Claims or Equity Interests. From and after
the Effective Date, the Debtors and Reorganized Debtors may settle or compromise
any Disputed Claim or Equity Interest without approval of the Bankruptcy Court.
The Debtors, Reorganizing Debtors and Reorganized Debtors also reserve the right
to resolve any Disputed Claims or Equity Interests outside the Bankruptcy Court
under applicable governing law.

          2.   Estimation of Claims and Equity Interests

          The Reorganizing Debtors and the Reorganized Debtors may, at any time,
request that the Bankruptcy Court estimate any contingent or unliquidated Claim
or Equity Interest pursuant to section 502(c) of the Bankruptcy Code regardless
of whether such Reorganizing Debtor or Reorganized Debtor has previously
objected to such Claim or Equity Interest or whether the Bankruptcy Court has
ruled on any such objection, and the Bankruptcy Court will retain jurisdiction
to estimate any Claim or Equity Interest at any time during litigation
concerning any objection to any Claim or Equity Interest, including during the
pendency of any appeal relating to any such objection. In the event that the
Bankruptcy Court estimates any contingent or unliquidated Claim, that estimated
amount will constitute either the Allowed amount of such Claim or a maximum
limitation on such Claim, as determined by the Bankruptcy Court. If the
estimated amount constitutes a maximum limitation on such Claim, the relevant
Reorganizing Debtor or Reorganized Debtor may elect to pursue any supplemental
proceedings to object to any ultimate payment on such Claim. All of the
aforementioned Claims or Equity Interests and objection, estimation and
resolution procedures are cumulative and not necessarily exclusive of one
another. Claims and Equity Interests may be estimated and subsequently
compromised, settled, withdrawn or resolved by any mechanism approved by the
Bankruptcy Court.

          3.   Payments and Distributions on Disputed Claims and Equity
               Interests

          Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, except as
otherwise agreed by a Reorganizing Debtor or Reorganized Debtor (for Claims
against the Reorganized Debtors) in its sole discretion, no partial payments and
no partial distributions will be made with respect to a Disputed Claim or Equity
Interest until the resolution of such disputes by settlement or Final Order. On
the date or, if such date is not a Business Day, on the next successive Business
Day that is 20 calendar days after the calendar quarter in which a Disputed
Claim or Equity Interest becomes an Allowed Claim or Allowed Equity Interest,
the Holder of such Allowed Claim or Allowed Equity Interest will receive all
payments and distributions to which such Holder is then entitled under the Plan.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Person or Entity who holds both an Allowed
Claim(s) and a Disputed Claim(s) (or an Allowed Equity Interest(s) and a
Disputed Equity Interest(s)) will not receive the appropriate payment or
distribution on the Allowed Claim(s) (or Allowed Equity Interest(s)) except, as
otherwise agreed by such Reorganizing Debtor or Reorganized Debtor, as the case
may be, in its sole discretion, until the Disputed Claim(s) or Disputed Equity
Interest(s) are resolved by settlement or Final Order. In the event that there
are Disputed Claims or Equity Interests requiring adjudication and resolution,
the Reorganizing Debtors and Reorganized Debtors reserve the right, or upon
order of the Court, to establish appropriate reserves for potential payment of
such Claims or Equity Interests.

B.        Allowance of Claims and Equity Interests

          Except as expressly provided herein or in any order entered in the
Chapter 11 Cases prior to the Effective Date (including the Confirmation Order),
no Claim or Equity Interest shall be deemed Allowed, unless and until such Claim
or Equity Interest is deemed Allowed under the Bankruptcy Code or the Bankruptcy
Court enters a Final Order in the Chapter 11 Cases allowing such Claim or Equity
Interest. Except as expressly provided in the Plan or any order entered in the
Chapter 11 Cases prior to the Effective Date (including the Confirmation Order),
the Reorganizing Debtors (for Claims against the Reorganizing Debtors) or
Reorganized Debtors after Confirmation will have and retain any and all rights
and defenses such Debtor had with respect to any Claim or Equity Interest as of
Petition Date.

C.        Controversy Concerning Impairment

          If a controversy arises as to whether any Claims or Equity Interests,
or any Class of Claims or Equity Interests, are Impaired under the Plan, the
Bankruptcy Court shall, after notice and a hearing, determine such controversy
before the Confirmation Date.

D.        Reserve of New CNC Common Stock

          On the Effective Date, CNC shall maintain in reserve shares of New CNC
Common Stock as the New CNC Common Stock Holdback. The New CNC Common Stock
Holdback, along with any dividends or other distributions accruing with respect
thereto, shall be held for the Holders of Disputed Class 4A, 8A, 10A, 11A-1 and
6B Claims and Equity Interests. As Disputed Class 4A, 8A, 10A, 11A-1 and 6B
Claims and Equity Interests are resolved, (a) CNC shall distribute, in
accordance with the terms hereof, New CNC Common Stock to Holders of Allowed
Class 4A, 8A, 10A, 11A-1 and 6B Claims and Equity Interests (along with
dividends and distributions that accrue after the Effective Date), and (b) the
New CNC Common Stock Holdback shall be adjusted.

                                   Article X.

                   RELEASE, INJUNCTIVE AND RELATED PROVISIONS

A.        Compromise and Settlement

          The allowance, classification and treatment of all Allowed Claims and
Equity Interests and the respective distributions and treatments hereunder take
into account and/or conform to the relative priority and rights of the Claims
and Equity Interests in each Class in connection with any contractual, legal and

Supplement, for good and valuable consideration, including the service of the
Releasees to facilitate the expeditious reorganization of the Debtors and the

Code), obligations, rights, suits, damages, Causes of Action, remedies and
liabilities whatsoever, including any derivative Claims asserted on behalf of a
Debtor, whether known or unknown, foreseen or unforeseen, existing or
hereinafter arising, in law, equity or otherwise, that the Debtors, Reorganized
Debtors or their subsidiaries would have been legally entitled to assert in
their own right (whether individually or collectively) or on behalf of the
Holder of any Claim or Equity Interest or other Person or Entity, based in whole
or in part upon any act or omission, transaction, agreement, event or other
occurrence taking place on or before the Effective Date, other than Claims or
liabilities arising out of or relating to (a) any act or omission of a Releasee

Releasees from any and all Claims (as defined in section 101(5) of the
Bankruptcy Code), obligations, rights, suits, damages, Causes of Action,
remedies and liabilities whatsoever, including any derivative Claims asserted on
behalf of a Debtor, whether known or unknown, foreseen or unforeseen, existing
or hereafter arising, in law, equity or otherwise, that such Person or Entity
would have been legally entitled to assert (whether individually or
collectively), based in whole or in part upon any act or omission, transaction,
agreement, event or other occurrence taking place on or before the Effective
Date in any way relating or pertaining to (w) the purchase or sale, or the
rescission of a purchase or sale, of any security of a Debtor, (x) a Debtor or
Reorganized Debtor, (y) the Chapter 11 Cases, or (z) the negotiation,
formulation and preparation of the Plan, or any related agreements, instruments
or other documents. No portion of the limited releases by the Holders of Claims
in any way impairs any Cause of Action, liability, Claim or right arising out of
or relating to (a) any act or omission of a Releasee that constitutes (1) a
failure to perform the duty to act in good faith, with the care of an ordinarily
prudent person and in a manner the Releasee reasonably believed to be in the
best interests of the corporation (to the extent such duty is imposed by
applicable non-bankruptcy law), and (2) constitutes willful misconduct or
recklessness, or (b) any Releasee's obligations to repay its obligations under
the D&O Credit Facilities.

D.        Exculpation

          The Debtors, Reorganizing Debtors, Releasees, Noteholder Subcommittee,
Lender Subcommittee, Official Committees, Unofficial Noteholder Committee,
Unofficial Bank Committee and their respective members, and the employees,
agents, and professionals of each of the foregoing (acting in such capacity)
shall neither have nor incur any liability to any Person or Entity for any pre
or post-petition act taken or omitted to be taken in connection with or related
to the formulation, negotiation, preparation, dissemination, implementation,
administration, Confirmation or Consummation of the Plan, the Disclosure
Statement or any contract, instrument, release or other agreement or document
created or entered into in connection with the Plan or any other pre or
post-petition act taken or omitted to be taken in connection with or in
contemplation of the restructuring of the Debtors.

E.        Preservation of Rights of Action

          1.   Maintenance of Causes of Action


          Except as otherwise provided in the Plan, the Reorganized Debtors
shall retain all rights to commence and pursue, as appropriate, any and all
Causes of Action, whether arising before or after the Petition Date, in any
court or other tribunal including, without limitation, in an adversary
proceeding Filed in one or more of the Chapter 11 Cases including the actions
specified in the Plan Supplement.

         Except as otherwise provided in the Plan, in accordance with section
1123(b)(3) of the Bankruptcy Code, any Claims, rights, and Causes of Action that
the respective Reorganizing Debtors may hold against any Entity shall vest in
the Reorganized Debtors, as the case may be. The applicable Reorganized Debtor,
through its authorized agents or representatives, shall retain and may
exclusively enforce any and all such Claims, rights or Causes of Action. The
Reorganized Debtors shall have the exclusive right, authority, and discretion to
institute, prosecute, abandon, settle, or compromise any and all such Claims,
rights, and Causes of Action without the consent or approval of any third party
and without any further order of court.

          2.   Preservation of All Causes of Action Not Expressly Settled or
               Released

          Unless a Claim or Cause of Action against a Creditor or other Person
is expressly waived, relinquished, released, compromised or settled in the Plan
or any Final Order, the Debtors expressly reserve such Claim or Cause of Action
for later adjudication by the Debtors, and, therefore, no preclusion doctrine,
including, without limitation, the doctrines of res judicata, collateral
estoppel, issue preclusion, Claim preclusion, waiver, estoppel (judicial,
equitable or otherwise) or laches shall apply to such Claims or Causes of Action
upon or after the confirmation or Consummation of the Plan based on the
Disclosure Statement, the Plan or the Confirmation Order, except where such
Claims or Causes of Action have been waived, relinquished, released, compromised
or settled in the Plan or a Final Order. In addition, the Debtors and the
successor entities under the Plan expressly reserve the right to pursue or adopt
any Claims not so waived, relinquished, released, compromised or settled that
are alleged in any lawsuit in

                                       45

www.bmccorp.net/Conseco. The documents contained in the Plan Supplement are an

B.        Effectuating Documents, Further Transactions and Corporation Action

          Each of the Debtors and Reorganized Debtors is authorized to execute,
deliver, file or record such contracts, instruments, releases and other
agreements or documents and take such actions as may be necessary or appropriate
to effectuate, implement and further evidence the terms and conditions hereof
and the notes and securities issued pursuant hereto.

          Prior to, on or after the Effective Date (as appropriate), all matters
provided for hereunder that would otherwise require approval of the shareholders
or directors of the Debtors or Reorganized Debtors shall be deemed to have
occurred and shall be in effect prior to, on or after the Effective Date (as
appropriate) pursuant to the general corporation laws of the State of Delaware,
the State of Indiana, or the State of Illinois (as appropriate) without any
requirement of further action by the shareholders or directors of the Debtors or
Reorganized Debtors.

C.        Dissolution of Committee(s)

          Upon the Effective Date, the Official Committees shall dissolve,
except with respect to any appeal of an order in the Chapter 11 Cases and
applications for Professional Fees, and members shall be released and discharged
from all rights, duties and liabilities arising from, or related to, the Chapter
11 Cases.

D.        Payment of Statutory Fees

          All fees payable pursuant to section 1930(a) of Title 28 of the United
States Code, as determined by the Bankruptcy Court at the hearing pursuant to
section 1128 of the Bankruptcy Code, shall be paid for each quarter (including
any fraction thereof) until the Chapter 11 Cases are converted, dismissed or
closed, whichever occurs first.

E.        Modification of Plan

          Subject to the limitations contained in the Plan,

          (1)   the Debtors reserve the right, in accordance with the Bankruptcy
Code and the Bankruptcy Rules, to amend or modify the Plan prior to the entry of
the Confirmation Order; and

          (2)   after the entry of the Confirmation Order, the Debtors or
Reorganized Debtors, as the case may be, may (with the consent of the Official
Committees whose consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
denied)), upon order of the Bankruptcy Court, amend or modify the Plan, in
accordance with section 1127(b) of the Bankruptcy Code, or remedy any defect or
omission or reconcile any inconsistency in the Plan in such manner as may be
necessary to carry out the purpose and intent of the Plan, provided however,
that (i) no material modification of the Plan that adversely affects the
treatment of Classes 6A, 7A, or 5B shall be made without the written consent of
the Noteholder Subcommittee and (ii) no material modification of the Plan that
adversely affects the treatment of Classes 5A or 4B shall be made without the
written consent of the Lender Subcommittee.

F.        Revocation of Plan

          The Debtors reserve the right (with the prior consent of the Official
Committees) to revoke or withdraw the Plan prior to the Confirmation Date and to
file subsequent plans of reorganization. If a Debtor revokes or withdraws the
Plan, or if Confirmation or Consummation does not occur, then (a) the Plan shall
be null and void in all respects, (b) any settlement or compromise embodied in
the Plan (including the fixing or limiting to an amount certain any Claim or
Equity Interest or Class of Claims or Equity Interests), assumption or rejection
of executory contracts or leases affected by the Plan, and any document or
agreement executed pursuant hereto, shall be deemed null and void, and (c)
nothing contained in the Plan shall (i) constitute a waiver or release of any
Claims by or against, or any

                                       48
<PAGE>

Equity Interests in, such Debtor or any other Person, (ii) prejudice in any
manner the rights of such Debtor or any other Person, or (iii) constitute an
admission of any sort by such Debtor or any other Person.

G.        Successors and Assigns

          The rights, benefits and obligations of any Person named or referred
to herein shall be binding on, and shall inure to the benefit of any heir,
executor, administrator, successor or assign of such Person.

H.        Reservation of Rights

          Except as expressly set forth herein, this Plan shall have no force or
effect unless the Bankruptcy Court shall enter the Confirmation Order. None of
the filing of this Plan, any statement or provision contained herein, or the
taking of any action by any Debtor with respect to this Plan, the Disclosure
Statement or Plan Supplement shall be or shall be deemed to be an admission or
waiver of any rights of any Debtor with respect to the Holders of Claims or
Equity Interests prior to the Effective Date.

I.        Section 1146 Exemption

          Pursuant to section 1146(c) of the Bankruptcy Code, under this Plan,
(i) the issuance, distribution, transfer or exchange of any debt, equity
security or other interest in the Debtors or Reorganized Debtors; (ii) the
creation, modification, consolidation or recording of any mortgage, deed of
trust, or other security interest, or the securing of additional indebtedness by
such or other means; (iii) the making, assignment or recording of any lease or
sublease; or (iv) the making, delivery or recording of any deed or other
instrument of transfer under, in furtherance of, or in connection with, this
Plan, including any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or other instrument of
transfer executed in connection with any transaction arising out of,
contemplated by, or in any way related to this Plan shall not be subject to any
document recording tax, mortgage recording tax, stamp tax or similar government
assessment, and the appropriate state or local government official or agent
shall be directed by the Bankruptcy Court to forego the collection of any such
tax or government assessment and to accept for filing and recording any of the
foregoing instruments or other documents without the payment of any such tax or
government assessment.

          All subsequent issuances, transfers or exchanges of securities, or the
making or delivery of any instrument of transfer by the Debtors in the Chapter
11 Cases, whether in connection with a sale under section 363 of the Bankruptcy
Code or otherwise, shall be deemed to be or have been done in furtherance of
this Plan. Specifically, because sale of the GM Building (or the entities owning
the GM Building or the interest therein), is being conducted pursuant to this
Plan, any instrument of transfer that would effect transfer of the GM Building
as proposed in pleadings filed in these Chapter 11 Cases may not be taxed under
any law imposing a stamp tax or similar tax.

J.        Further Assurances

          The Debtors, Reorganized Debtors and all Holders of Claims or Equity
Interests receiving distributions hereunder and all other parties in interest
shall, from time to time, prepare, execute and deliver any agreements or
documents and take any other actions as may be necessary or advisable to
effectuate the provisions and intent of this Plan.

K.        Service of Documents

served on or delivered to the Debtors or Reorganized Debtors shall be sent by
