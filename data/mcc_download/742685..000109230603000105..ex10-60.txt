effective registration statement under the Securities Act and in compliance with
applicable  state  securities  laws or (ii)  unless  and until it shall have (A)

action necessary for compliance with the Securities Act and any applicable state
securities  laws  has been  taken  or an  exemption  from  the  registration  or
qualification  requirements  of the  Securities  Act  and  such  state  laws  is
