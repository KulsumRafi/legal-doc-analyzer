                  "Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
                  Section 6.11, Borrower may, from time to time, designate any
                  Subsidiary which is intended to have health professionals as
                  minority shareholders and which is not already a Subsidiary
                  Guarantor (other than Subsidiary Guarantors primarily involved
                  in operating (but not owning) outpatient surgery centers and
                  medical office buildings or Subsidiary Guarantors who are no
                  longer involved in any business activities), as an "Exempt
                  Subsidiary" by written notice to the Administrative Agent, so
                  long as (i) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred
                  and be continuing after giving effect to such designation,
                  (ii) after giving effect to such designation, as of the date
                  of any such designation, no more than 5% of the Consolidated
                  EBITDA of LifePoint Parent for the most recently ended
                  Reference Period was derived from the Exempt Subsidiaries,
                  (iii) after giving effect to such designation, as of the date
                  of any such designation, the aggregate amount of assets of all
                  Exempt Subsidiaries does not exceed 10% of the Consolidated
                  Total Assets of LifePoint Parent calculated as of the last day
                  of the most recently ended Reference Period, (iv) the Borrower
                  or a Subsidiary Guarantor owns no less than 51% on a fully
                  diluted basis of the Equity Interests of the Exempt
                  Subsidiaries at all times (unless the Disposition of such
                  Exempt Subsidiary is permitted under Section 7.5), and (v) no
                  Exempt Subsidiaries are primarily involved in the business of
                  owning and operating Hospitals. Pursuant to the foregoing, if
                  an existing Subsidiary Guarantor is designated as an Exempt
                  Subsidiary, it shall transfer its tangible personal property
                  (except inventory), real estate and fixtures constituting
                  Collateral, subject only to the Lien in favor of the
                  Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lenders and other
                  existing Permitted Liens hereunder, to a wholly-owned
                  Subsidiary which becomes a party to the Guarantee and Security
                  Agreement on or prior to such transfer and assumes all
                  obligations of such Exempt Subsidiary under any Mortgages, the
                  Guarantee and Security Agreement and other applicable Security
                  Documents with respect to such Collateral. Assuming the
                  designation of an Exempt Subsidiary complies with all of the
                  foregoing, the Administrative Agent agrees to release the
                  Exempt Subsidiary from the Guarantee and Security Agreement
                  and agrees to release the assets remaining in the Exempt
                  Subsidiary, after the aforementioned transfer, from the
                  security interest granted in favor of the Lenders pursuant to
                  the Guarantee and Security Agreement."

         D.       CONSOLIDATED NET WORTH. Section 7.1(c) of the Credit Agreement
is amended to read in its entirety as follows:

                           "(c) Consolidated Net Worth. At all times after the
                  end of the first fiscal quarter to occur after the Closing
                  Date, permit Consolidated Net Worth of LifePoint Parent to be
                  less than the sum of (i) $204,400,000 plus (ii) as of the end
                  of each fiscal quarter to occur after the Closing Date, an
                  amount equal to 50% of Consolidated Net Income (but not less
                  than zero) for such fiscal quarter, such


                                       -5-
<PAGE>

                  increases to be cumulative, plus (iii) an amount equal to 100%
                  of Net Cash Proceeds from any offering of Equity Interests of
                  Borrower or any direct or indirect Subsidiary of Borrower
                  consummated after the Closing Date."

as follows:

                  1.       By adding at the end of clause (c) thereof the words:

         (d) thereof: "provided, however, the aggregate amount of all
         Indebtedness owed by Exempt Subsidiaries to Persons other than Borrower
         or any Subsidiary Guarantor shall not exceed $10,000,000 at any time
         outstanding."

                  3.       By deleting subparagraph (g) thereof and substituting
         therefor the following:

                           "(g) Indebtedness of LifePoint Parent (and the
                  related Guarantee Obligations, if any) pursuant to any public
                  offering of Subordinated Debt (including without limitation,
                  any unsecured Subordinated Debt convertible into Equity
                  Interests) occurring after the Closing Date, provided that, on
                  the date such Indebtedness is incurred and after giving effect
                  thereto, (i) no Default or Event of Default shall have
                  occurred and be continuing and (ii) the ratio of Consolidated
                  Total Debt of LifePoint Parent (calculated as of the last day
