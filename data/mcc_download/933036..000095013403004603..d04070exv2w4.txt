Dear Sir:

         Reference is made to that certain Asset Purchase Agreement, dated as of
December 17, 2002 (the "ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT"), by and among Rent-A-Center
East, Inc., a Delaware corporation (formerly known as Rent-A-Center, Inc.)
("ACQUIROR"), and Rent-Way, Inc. (the "COMPANY"), Rent-Way of Michigan, Inc.
("RENT-WAY MICHIGAN") and Rent-Way of TTIG, L.P. ("TTIG" and, together with
Rent-Way Michigan, the "OPERATING SUBSIDIARIES"). Capitalized terms not
otherwise defined herein shall have the meaning ascribed to such terms in the
Asset Purchase Agreement.

         Effective as of December 31, 2002, Acquiror consummated an internal
reorganization of its corporate structure. By virtue of an inversion merger,
Acquiror created a holding company structure pursuant to which a Delaware
corporation became the sole stockholder of Acquiror and changed its name to
"Rent-A-Center, Inc." ("HOLDING COMPANY"). The stockholders of Acquiror prior to
the merger became stockholders of Holding Company immediately upon the merger.
Acquiror changed its name to "Rent-A-Center East, Inc." and transferred
substantially all of Acquiror's assets related to stores in Texas and its
headquarters operations to Rent-A-Center Texas, L.P., a Texas limited
partnership, the general partner of which is the Acquiror, and all of Acquiror's
assets related to stores in the western portion of the United States to
Rent-A-Center West, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of
Acquiror.

         Acquiror has not transferred the Asset Purchase Agreement and remains
the primary obligor thereunder. This letter agreement memorializes the
understanding of the parties to the Asset Purchase Agreement regarding the
reorganization and hereby amends, modifies and supplements the Asset Purchase
Agreement as follows:

         1.     Acquiror Obligations. The parties acknowledge that, except as
                specifically provided for herein, the term "Acquiror" as used
                herein, in the Asset Purchase Agreement and in the documents
                referenced therein shall mean Rent-A-Center East, Inc., formerly
                known as Rent-A-Center, Inc.

                  2.       Solvency and Reasonably Equivalent Value Opinions.
                           With respect to Section 4.7 and Section 5.2(l) of the
                           Asset Purchase Agreement related to the Solvency
                           Opinion and Section 4.8 and Section 5.2(k) of the
                           Asset Purchase Agreement related to the Reasonably
                           Equivalent Value Opinion, the parties hereby agree
                           that Holding Company may perform Acquiror's
                           obligations thereunder. The parties acknowledge that
                           in the event Holding Company obtains and delivers the
                           Solvency Opinion and the Reasonably Equivalent Value
                           Opinion, the covenants set forth in Section 4.7 and
                           Section 4.8 and the conditions to closing set forth
                           in Section 5.2(k) and Section 5.2(l) shall be deemed
                           to have been complied with, notwithstanding that such
                           covenants and conditions to closing were complied
                           with by Holding Company and not Acquiror.

                  3.       Entire Agreement. Notwithstanding the provisions of
                           Section 9.5 of the Asset Purchase Agreement and
                           consistent with Section 7.4 of the Asset Purchase
                           Agreement, this letter agreement, together with the
                           Asset Purchase Agreement and all other documents and
                           instruments referred to therein, including, but not
                           limited to, the letter from Acquiror to the Company
                           and the Operating Subsidiaries dated December 31,
                           2002, relating to the extension of the Due Diligence
                           Period, constitutes the entire agreement and
                           supersedes all other prior agreements and
                           undertakings, both written and oral, among the
                           parties with respect to the transactions contemplated
                           by the Asset Purchase Agreement.

                  4.       No Further Amendments. Other than as specifically
                           provided for herein, all other terms and conditions
                           of the Asset Purchase Agreement shall remain in full
                           force and effect in accordance with its terms.

                  5.       Governing Law. The provisions of Section 9.9 of the
                           Asset Purchase Agreement shall apply to this letter
