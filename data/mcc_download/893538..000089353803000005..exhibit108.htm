         WHEREAS,  St.  Mary,  FJOG and BWOG  have  entered  into  that  certain
Purchase  and Sale  Agreement  dated as of December  13, 2002 (the "PSA") by and

3,380,818  shares (the  "Shares") of St. Mary common stock,  $0.01 par value per

         WHEREAS,  as a condition  to the closing of the PSA,  St. Mary  desires
that each of FJOG and BWOG agree to certain transfer  restrictions  with respect
to the Shares of St. Mary Stock as set forth in this Agreement; and

         WHEREAS,  all capitalized  terms used but not defined herein shall have
the respective meanings given to them in the PSA.

         NOW,  THEREFORE,  in  consideration  of the  premises  and  the  mutual
agreements  contained  herein and in the PSA,  and for other  good and  valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the
parties hereto hereby agree as follows:

                                    AGREEMENT

         Section 1. Restrictions on Transfer of Shares of St. Mary Stock.  Until
                    ----------------------------------------------------
a period of two years has  elapsed  from the  Closing of the PSA,  FJOG and BWOG
shall  not make any  disposition  by  assignment,  sale,  distribution,  pledge,
hypothecation, encumbrance or any other disposition (a "Transfer") of all or any
portion of the Shares of St. Mary Stock issued to FJOG and BWOG  pursuant to the
PSA. Any Transfer in violation of the foregoing shall be void.

         Section  2.   Permitted   Transfers.   Notwithstanding   the  foregoing
                       ---------------------
provisions of Section 1 above, the above transfer  restrictions  shall not apply
to the following transactions or under the following circumstances:

                  (a) After a period of one year has elapsed from the Closing of
         the PSA, FJOG and BWOG may liquidate and  distribute  the Shares of St.
         Mary  Stock  issued to them  under  the PSA to Flying J Inc.,  and such
         shares  shall,  as held by Flying J Inc.,  continue  to be bound by the
         restrictions  set forth in this  Agreement  until a period of two years
         has elapsed from the Closing of the PSA.

                  (b) In the event of an Acquisition of St. Mary (as hereinafter
         defined),  the restrictions on the Transfer of Shares of St. Mary Stock
         described in Section 1 above shall  terminate and any shares of capital
         stock of the acquirer (or an  affiliate  of the  acquirer)  received by
         FJOG, BWOG or Flying J Inc. in the Acquisition of St. Mary shall not be
         subject to such restrictions.  For purposes of this Agreement, the term
         "Acquisition  of St.  Mary"  shall  mean the  occurrence  of any of the
         following events: (i) St. Mary shall not be the surviving entity in any
         merger  (other  than a merger with a  subsidiary  of St.  Mary),  share
         exchange,  consolidation or other reorganization (or survives only as a
         subsidiary of an entity other than an affiliate of St.  Mary);  or (ii)
         St. Mary sells,  leases or exchanges  all or  substantially  all of its
         assets  to any  other  person  or  entity  (other  than a wholly  owned
         subsidiary of St.  Mary).  In the event of a tender offer for shares of
         St. Mary Stock which is approved by the Board of  Directors of St. Mary
         pursuant to a plan  intended to result in a subsequent  Acquisition  of
         St. Mary,  FJOG,  BWOG or Flying J Inc. may  participate in such tender
         offer with  respect to their  Shares of St. Mary Stock and the maker of
         such tender offer shall not be subject to the  restrictions on Transfer
         with respect to such Shares of St. Mary Stock.

                  (c) Transfers between FJOG and BWOG.

         Section 3.  Restrictive  Legends  and Stop  Transfer  Instructions.  To
                     ------------------------------------------------------
ensure compliance with this Agreement,  each certificate representing the Shares
of St. Mary Stock to be issued to FJOG and BWOG  pursuant to the PSA shall bear,
in addition to any legend or legends required by applicable  securities laws and
any other agreements  pertaining to such Shares,  a legend in substantially  the
following form:

              THE  SECURITIES  REPRESENTED  BY THIS CERTIFICATE  ARE

              2003 WHICH PLACES CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS ON THE TRANSFER
              OF THE SHARES REPRESENTED HEREBY. A COPY OF SUCH SHARE

                                       2

         Section 4. Removal of Legends and Stop Transfer Instructions.  When the
                    -------------------------------------------------
Transfer  restrictions  imposed  by this  Agreement  terminate  by reason of the
passage of time or  otherwise,  a holder of Shares of St.  Mary Stock  issued to
FJOG and BWOG  pursuant to the PSA shall be entitled to receive  from St.  Mary,
without cost or expense,  new certificates  representing such shares that do not
