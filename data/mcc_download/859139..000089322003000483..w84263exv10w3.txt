reasonable care in the custody and preservation of the Collateral if it takes
such action for that purpose as the Pledgor requests in writing, but failure of

deemed a failure to exercise reasonable care, and no failure of the Collateral
Agent to preserve or protect any rights with respect to the Collateral against
prior or other parties, or to do

                                       6

                           Default with respect to Section 9.01(f) of the Credit
                           Agreement or an Event of Default, resort to the

                           any obligation hereunder, whether or not the
                           Collateral Agent (i) shall have resorted to any other
                           property securing any of the Liabilities or any

continuing:

                  (a)      Subject to the provisions of the Credit Agreement,

                           to Section 7.2 hereof, be entitled to receive and
                           retain or otherwise deal with any and all cash
                           dividends, interest and principal on the Collateral

                           delivered to the Collateral Agent or its designated
                           nominee (accompanied, if appropriate, by proper
                           instruments of assignment and/or undated stock or
                           bond powers executed by the Pledgor in accordance
                           with the Collateral Agent's instructions) to be held
                           subject to the terms of this Pledge Agreement.

                  (b)      If the Collateral or any part thereof shall have been
                           registered in the name of the Collateral Agent or its
                           sub-agent, the Collateral Agent shall execute and
                           deliver (or cause to be executed and delivered) to
                           the Pledgor all such dividend, interest and principal
                           orders and other instruments as the Pledgor may
                           request for the purpose of enabling the Pledgor to
                           receive the dividends, interest, principal or other
                           payments which it is authorized to receive and retain
                           pursuant to clause (a) above.

         SECTION 7.2 Occurrence of Default. Upon the occurrence and during the
continuance of a Default with respect to Section 9.01(f) of the Credit Agreement
or an Event of Default, (a) all rights of the Pledgor pursuant to Section 7.1(a)
hereof shall cease and the Collateral Agent, subject to the terms of the SIG
Pledge Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement, shall have the sole and
exclusive right and authority to receive and retain the dividends (cash or
other), interest and principal which the Pledgor would otherwise be authorized
to retain and (b) subject to the terms of the SIG Pledge Agreement and the
Intercreditor Agreement, all such dividends, interest and principal and all
other distributions and payments made on or in respect of the Collateral which
may at any time and from time to time be held by the Pledgor, shall, until
delivery to the Collateral Agent, be held by the Pledgor separate and apart from
its other property in trust for the Collateral Agent. Any and all money and
other property paid over to or received by the Collateral Agent pursuant to the
provisions of this Section 7.2 shall be retained by the Collateral Agent as
additional Collateral hereunder and be applied in accordance with the provisions
hereof.

                                    SECTION 8

                                     DEFAULT

         SECTION 8.1 Occurrence of Default. Upon the occurrence and during the
continuance of a Default with respect to Section 9.01(f) of the Credit Agreement
or an Event of Default, and notwithstanding any provision contained herein to
the contrary, subject to the requirements of the Applicable Insurance Code and
the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Collateral Agent may exercise from
time to time any rights and remedies available to it under the Uniform
Commercial Code as in effect from time to time in Illinois or otherwise
available to it, including, without limitation, sale, assignment, or other
disposal of the Collateral in exchange for cash or credit. If any notification
of intended disposition of any of the Collateral is required by law, such

                                       9

<PAGE>

notification, if mailed, shall be deemed reasonably and properly given if mailed
at least ten (10) days before such disposition, postage prepaid, addressed to
the Pledgor either at the address of the Pledgor shown below, or at any other
address of the Pledgor appearing on the records of the Collateral Agent. Subject
to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, any proceeds of any disposition of
Collateral shall be applied as provided in Section 9 hereof. No rights and
remedies of the Collateral Agent expressed hereunder are intended to be
exclusive of any other right or remedy, but every such right or remedy shall be
cumulative and shall be in addition to all other rights and remedies herein
conferred, or conferred upon the Collateral Agent under any other agreement or
instrument relating to any of the Liabilities or security therefor or now or
hereafter existing at law or in equity or by statute. No delay on the part of
the Collateral Agent in the exercise of any right or remedy shall operate as a
waiver thereof, and no single or partial exercise by the Collateral Agent of any
right or remedy shall preclude other or further exercise thereof or the exercise
of any other right or remedy. No action of the Collateral Agent permitted
hereunder shall impair or affect the rights of the Collateral Agent in and to
the Collateral.

         SECTION 8.2 Sale of Collateral.

                  (a)      The Pledgor agrees that in any sale permitted
                           hereunder of any of the Collateral the Collateral
                           Agent is authorized to comply with any limitation or
                           restriction in connection with such sale as counsel
                           may advise the Collateral Agent is necessary in order
                           to avoid any violation of applicable law (including,
                           without limitation, obtaining any approval required
                           by any Department, compliance with such procedures as
                           may restrict the number of prospective bidders and
                           purchasers, require that such prospective bidders and
                           purchasers have certain qualifications, and restrict
                           such prospective bidders and purchasers to persons
                           who will represent and agree that they are purchasing
                           for their own account for investment and not with a
                           view to the distribution or resale of such
                           Collateral), or in order to obtain any required
                           approval of the sale or of the purchaser by any
                           governmental regulatory authority or official, and
                           the Pledgor further agrees that such compliance shall
                           not result in such sale being considered or deemed
                           not to have been made in a commercially reasonable
                           manner, nor shall the Collateral Agent be liable nor
                           accountable to the Pledgor for any discount allowed
                           by the reason of the fact that such Collateral is
                           sold in compliance with any such limitation or
                           restriction.

                  (b)      Subject to the terms of the SIG Pledge Agreement and
                           the Intercreditor Agreement and without limiting the
                           rights of the Collateral Agent under any other
                           provision of this Pledge Agreement, and in addition
                           thereto, the Pledgor agrees that, to the maximum
                           extent permitted by law, after a Default with respect
                           to Section 9.01(f) of the Credit Agreement or an
                           Event of Default shall have occurred and be
                           continuing, upon written request from the Collateral
                           Agent, the Pledgor shall cause Safety National to
                           prepare, file and use its best efforts to cause to
                           become effective promptly, a registration statement
                           complying with the Securities Act of 1933, as
                           amended, for the public sale of such of the
                           Collateral as the Collateral Agent may elect, and to
                           take comparable action to permit such

                           sales under the securities laws of such jurisdictions
                           as the Collateral Agent may designate and shall cause
                           Safety National to enter into and perform its
                           obligations under one or more underwriting agreements
                           in connection therewith, containing customary
                           representations, warranties, covenants and
                           indemnities and contribution provisions if requested
                           by the Collateral Agent. If such registration
                           statement is filed, the Pledgor agrees to cause
                           Safety National (i) to keep any such registration
                           statement and related prospectus effective, current
                           and in compliance with applicable federal and state
                           securities laws so long as required to satisfy
                           applicable prospectus delivery requirements and (ii)
                           at the request of the Collateral Agent at any time
                           after the effective date of any such registration
                           statement, to use reasonable efforts to file
                           post-effective amendments to such registration
                           statement so that the Collateral Agent's sales of
                           Pledged Shares or other Collateral will be covered by
                           a current prospectus and can be made in compliance
                           with all applicable federal and state securities
                           laws. Nothing contained in this Section 8.2(b) shall
                           be deemed to require the preparation, filing or
                           effectiveness of more than one registration statement
                           by Safety National.

                  (c)      Subject to the terms of the SIG Pledge Agreement and
                           the Intercreditor Agreement, the Pledgor further
                           agrees, after a Default with respect to Section
                           9.01(f) of the Credit Agreement or an Event of
                           Default shall have occurred and be continuing, and
                           upon written request from the Collateral Agent, to
                           (i) deliver and cause Safety National to deliver to
                           the Collateral Agent such information as the
                           Collateral Agent shall reasonably request for
                           inclusion in any registration statement, prospectus
                           or offering memorandum or in any preliminary
                           prospectus or preliminary offering memorandum or any
                           amendment or supplement to any thereof or in any
                           other writing prepared in connection with the offer,
                           sale or resale of all or any portion of the Pledged
                           Shares or other Collateral, which information shall
                           not contain any untrue statement of a material fact
                           or omit to state a material fact required to be
                           stated or necessary to make such information not
                           misleading, and (ii) do or cause to be done all such
                           other acts and things as may be necessary to make
                           such offer, sale or resale of all or any portion of
                           the Pledged Shares or other Collateral valid and
                           binding and in compliance with any and all applicable
                           laws, regulations, orders, writs, injunctions,
                           decrees or awards of any and all courts, arbitrators
                           or governmental agencies or instrumentalities,
                           domestic or foreign, having jurisdiction over any
                           such offer, sale or resale.

                  (d)      Without limiting the foregoing paragraph, if the
                           Collateral Agent decides to exercise its right under
                           this Section 8 to sell all or any of the Pledged
                           Shares or other Collateral, upon written request, the
                           Pledgor shall furnish or cause to be furnished to the
                           Collateral Agent all such information as the
                           Collateral Agent may request in order to qualify such
                           Pledged Shares or other Collateral as exempt
                           securities, or the sale or resale of such Pledged
                           Shares or other Collateral as exempt transactions,
                           under federal and state

                           securities laws. The Pledgor agrees to allow, and to
                           cause Safety National to allow, the Collateral Agent
                           and any underwriter access at reasonable times and
                           places to the books, records and premises of Safety
                           National; the Pledgor further agrees to assist, and
                           cause Safety National to assist, the Collateral
                           Agent, any underwriter, any agent of any thereof, and
                           any counsel, accountant or other expert for any
                           thereof, in inspection, evaluation, and any other
                           "due diligence" action of or with respect to any such
                           books, records and premises; and the Pledgor further
                           agrees to cause any independent public accountant for
                           Safety National to furnish a letter to the Collateral
                           Agent and underwriters in customary form and covering
                           matters of the type customarily covered by letters of
                           accountants for issuers to underwriters.

                  (e)      The Pledgor further agrees to indemnify and hold
                           harmless the Collateral Agent, the Administrative
                           Agent and the Lenders, and each of their respective
                           officers, directors, employees and agents,
                           successors, assigns and any Person in control of any
                           thereof, from and against any loss, liability, claim,
                           damage and expense, including, without limitation,
                           counsel fees (in this paragraph collectively called
                           the "Indemnified Liabilities"), under federal and
                           state securities laws or otherwise insofar as such
                           loss, liability, claim, damage or expense arises (i)
                           out of or is based upon any untrue statement or
                           alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained
                           in any registration statement, prospectus or offering
                           memorandum or in any preliminary prospectus or
                           preliminary offering memorandum or any amendment or
                           supplement to any thereof or in any other writing
                           prepared in connection with the offer, sale or resale
                           of all or any portion of the Pledged Shares or other
                           Collateral unless such untrue statement or material
                           fact was provided in writing by the Collateral Agent
                           or any underwriter specifically for inclusion
                           therein, or (ii) out of or is based upon any omission
                           or alleged omission to state therein a material fact
                           required to be stated or necessary to make the
                           statements therein not misleading, such
                           indemnification to remain operative regardless of any
                           investigation made by or on behalf of the Collateral
                           Agent or any successors thereof, or any Person in
                           control of any thereof. In connection with a public
                           sale or other distribution, the Pledgor will provide
                           customary indemnification to any underwriters, their
                           respective successors and assigns, their respective
                           officers and directors and each Person who controls
                           any such underwriter (within the meaning of the
                           Securities Act of 1933, as amended). If and to the
                           extent that the foregoing undertakings in this
                           paragraph may be unenforceable for any reason, the
                           Pledgor agrees to make the maximum contribution to
                           the payment and satisfaction of each of the
                           Indemnified Liabilities which is permissible under
                           applicable law. The obligations of the Pledgor under
                           this clause (e) shall survive any termination of this
                           Pledge Agreement.

                             APPLICATION OF PROCEEDS

                  Subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the
proceeds of sale of Collateral sold pursuant to the terms of Section 8 hereof
and/or, after a Default with respect to Section 9.01(f) of the Credit Agreement
or an Event of Default, the cash held as Collateral hereunder, shall be applied
by the Collateral Agent toward the payment of the Liabilities and all reasonable
costs and expenses of the Collateral Agent (whether or not such costs and
expenses are incurred by the Collateral Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of
the Lenders) and the Collateral Agent's counsel incurred in connection with the
administration and enforcement of this Pledge Agreement, the Credit Agreement
and the other Related Documents, in such order of application as the Collateral
Agent may from time to time elect.

                                   SECTION 10

               AUTHORITY OF THE COLLATERAL AGENT; INDEMNIFICATION

                  The Collateral Agent shall have, and be entitled to exercise,
all such powers hereunder as are specifically delegated to the Collateral Agent
by the terms hereof, together with such powers as are incidental thereto. The
Collateral Agent may execute any of its duties hereunder by or through agents or
employees and shall be entitled to retain counsel and to act in reliance upon
the advice of such counsel concerning all matters pertaining to its duties
hereunder. Neither the Collateral Agent, nor any director, officer or employee
of the Collateral Agent shall be liable for any action taken or omitted to be
taken by it hereunder or in connection herewith, except for its own gross
negligence or willful misconduct. The Pledgor hereby agrees to reimburse the
Collateral Agent, on demand, for all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by
the Collateral Agent in connection with the administration and enforcement of
this Pledge Agreement (including, without limitation, reasonable costs and
expenses incurred by any agent employed by the Collateral Agent) and agrees to
indemnify (which indemnification shall survive any termination of this Pledge
Agreement) and hold harmless the Collateral Agent (and any such agent employed
by the Collateral Agent) from and against any and all liability incurred by the
Collateral Agent (or such agent employed by the Collateral Agent) hereunder or
in connection herewith, unless such liability shall be due to gross negligence
or willful misconduct on the part of the Collateral Agent, or such agent
employed by the Collateral Agent, as the case may be.

                                   SECTION 11

                                   TERMINATION

                  The Pledgor agrees that its pledge hereunder shall
(notwithstanding, without limitation, that at any time or from time to time all
Liabilities may have been paid in full) terminate only when all Liabilities
(including, without limitation, any extensions or renewals of any thereof) and
all interest thereon and all expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable
attorneys' fees and legal expenses) paid or incurred by the Collateral Agent or
the holder or the holders of the Notes in endeavoring to enforce this Pledge
Agreement, the Credit Agreement and the other Related Documents to which the
Collateral Agent is a beneficiary shall have been

                                       13

<PAGE>

finally paid in full and all other obligations of the Pledgor hereunder and
thereunder have been fully performed, and all Commitments under the Credit
Agreement have been terminated, at which time the Collateral Agent shall
reassign and redeliver (or cause to be reassigned and redelivered) to the
Pledgor, or to such Person or Persons as the Pledgor shall designate, such of
the Collateral (if any) as shall not have been sold or otherwise applied by the
Collateral Agent pursuant to the terms hereof and shall still be held by it
hereunder, together with appropriate instruments of reassignment and release.
Any such reassignment shall be without recourse upon, or representation or
warranty by, the Collateral Agent and at the sole cost and expense of the
Pledgor. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement and the pledge hereunder
shall immediately and permanently terminate under the circumstances set forth in
Section 4.02 of the Credit Agreement, upon which termination the Collateral
Agent shall effect the reassignment and redelivery of the Collateral in
accordance with the foregoing provisions of this Section 11.

                                   SECTION 12

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

         SECTION 12.1 Amendments. No amendment, modification, termination or
waiver of any provision of this Pledge Agreement, and no consent to any
departure by the Pledgor herefrom, shall in any event be effective unless the
same shall be in writing and signed by the Collateral Agent and the Required
Lenders, and then any such amendment, modification, waiver or consent shall be
effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which
given.

         SECTION 12.2 Captions. Section captions in this Pledge Agreement are
for convenience only, and shall not affect the construction of this Pledge
Agreement.

         SECTION 12.3 Notices. All notices, requests and other communications to
any party hereunder shall be in writing (including bank wire, telex or telecopy
or similar writing) and shall be given to such party in accordance with the
notice provision in the Credit Agreement. Each such notice, request or other
communication shall be effective (a) if given by mail, three (3) days after such
communication is deposited in the mails with first class postage prepaid,
addressed as aforesaid, (b) if given by facsimile, when such telecopy is
transmitted to the telecopy number as specified in the Credit Agreement and the
appropriate confirmation is received, or (c) if given by any other means, when
delivered at the address specified in Section 11.02 of the Credit Agreement.

         SECTION 12.4 Waivers. The Pledgor hereby expressly waives: (a) notice
of the acceptance by the Collateral Agent of this Pledge Agreement, (b) notice
of the existence or creation or non-payment of all or any of the Liabilities,
(c) presentment, demand, notice of dishonor, protest, and all other notices
whatsoever, and (d) all diligence in collection or protection of or realization
upon the Liabilities or any thereof, any obligation hereunder, or any security
for or guaranty of any of the foregoing.

         SECTION 12.5 Further Assurances. The Pledgor agrees that, if at any
time all or any part of any payment theretofore applied by the Collateral Agent
to any of the Liabilities is or must be rescinded or returned by the Collateral
Agent for any reason whatsoever (including,

                                       14

<PAGE>

without limitation, the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of any of the
Borrower or its Subsidiaries), such Liabilities shall, for the purposes of this
Pledge Agreement, to the extent that such payment is or must be rescinded or
returned, be deemed to have continued in existence, notwithstanding such
application by the Collateral Agent, and the pledge by the Pledgor hereunder
shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, as to such
Liabilities, all as though such application by the Collateral Agent had not been
made.

         SECTION 12.6 SUBMISSION TO JURISDICTION; WAIVER OF VENUE. THE PLEDGOR
(A) HEREBY IRREVOCABLY SUBMITS TO THE JURISDICTION OF ANY ILLINOIS STATE OR
FEDERAL COURT SITTING IN CHICAGO, ILLINOIS OVER ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING
OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS PLEDGE AGREEMENT AND THE PLEDGOR HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
AGREES THAT ALL CLAIMS IN RESPECT OF SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING MAY BE HEARD AND
DETERMINED IN SUCH ILLINOIS STATE OR FEDERAL COURT, AND (B) AGREES NOT TO
INSTITUTE ANY LEGAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING AGAINST THE COLLATERAL AGENT OR THE
DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, COLLATERAL AGENT OR PROPERTY OF THE COLLATERAL
AGENT, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS PLEDGE AGREEMENT, IN ANY COURT OTHER
THAN AS HEREINABOVE SPECIFIED IN THIS SECTION 12.6. THE PLEDGOR HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY OBJECTION IT MAY
NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE LAYING OF VENUE IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING
(WHETHER BROUGHT BY THE PLEDGOR, ANY SUBSIDIARY, THE COLLATERAL AGENT, OR
OTHERWISE) IN ANY COURT HEREINABOVE SPECIFIED IN THIS SECTION 12.6 AS WELL AS
ANY RIGHT IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO REMOVE ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING,
ONCE COMMENCED, TO ANOTHER COURT ON THE GROUNDS OF FORUM NON CONVENIENS OR
OTHERWISE. THE PLEDGOR AGREES THAT A FINAL JUDGMENT IN ANY SUCH ACTION OR
PROCEEDING SHALL BE CONCLUSIVE AND MAY BE ENFORCED IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS BY
SUIT ON THE JUDGMENT OR IN ANY OTHER MANNER PROVIDED BY LAW.

         SECTION 12.7 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY KNOWINGLY,
VOLUNTARILY AND INTENTIONALLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING, CLAIM OR COUNTERCLAIM CONCERNING ANY RIGHTS UNDER THIS PLEDGE
AGREEMENT OR UNDER ANY OTHER DOCUMENT OR AGREEMENT DELIVERED OR WHICH MAY IN THE
FUTURE BE DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THEREWITH, OR ARISING FROM ANY
BANKING RELATIONSHIP EXISTING IN CONNECTION WITH THIS PLEDGE AGREEMENT, AND
AGREE THAT ANY SUCH ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM SHALL BE TRIED BEFORE A
COURT AND NOT BEFORE A JURY; THIS PROVISION IS A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT FOR THE
COLLATERAL AGENT ENTERING INTO THIS PLEDGE AGREEMENT AND FOR THE COLLATERAL
AGENT TO MAKE THE LOANS PURSUANT TO THE CREDIT AGREEMENT.

         SECTION 12.8 Governing Law; Terms; Interpretation. This Pledge
Agreement shall be a contract made under and governed by the laws of the state
of Illinois, without regard to its conflicts of law principles. All obligations

not in limitation of those provided by applicable law. Wherever possible, each
provision of this Pledge Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be
effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision of this Pledge
Agreement shall be prohibited by or invalid under such law, such provision shall
be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without
invalidating the remainder of such provision or the remaining provisions of this
