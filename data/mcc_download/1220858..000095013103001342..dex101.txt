                  SALE OF MORTGAGE LOANS AND RELATED PROVISIONS

          Section 2.01 Sale of Closing Date Mortgage Loans and MI Policies.

          (a)  The Seller hereby sells, and the Company hereby purchases on the
Closing Date the Closing Date Mortgage Loans identified (and the related MI
Policies) on the Mortgage Loan Schedule annexed hereto as Exhibit 1, the
proceeds thereof and all rights under the Related Documents (including the
related Mortgage Files). The Closing Date Mortgage Loans consist of two groups
of conventional, residential first and second lien mortgage loans with fixed and
adjustable interest rates, the Group I Mortgage Loans and the Group II Mortgage
Loans. The Closing Date Mortgage Loans will have a Principal Balance as of the
close of business on the Cut-off Date, after giving effect to any payments due
on or before such date whether or not received, of approximately $1,084,764,759.
The sale of the Closing Date Mortgage Loans will take place on the Closing Date,
subject to and simultaneously with the deposit of the Closing Date Mortgage
Loans and the Original Pre-Funded Amount into the Trust Fund, the issuance of
the Securities by the Trustee and the sale of the Underwritten Certificates
pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement. The purchase price (the "Purchase
Price") for the Closing Date Mortgage Loans to be paid by the Company to the
Seller on the Closing Date shall consist of the following:

               (i)  a payment in an amount equal to $1,254,489,064 representing
the net proceeds of the sale of the Underwritten Certificates, which payment
shall be paid to the Seller by wire transfer in immediately available funds on
the Closing Date by or on behalf of the Company, or as otherwise agreed by the
Company; and

               (ii) a payment in an amount equal to $13,000,000 representing the
proceeds of the sale of the Retained Certificates by the Company to NRFC
pursuant to the REMIC Interests Sale Agreement, which payment shall be paid to
the Seller by wire transfer in immediately available funds on the Closing Date
by or on behalf of the Company, or as otherwise agreed by the Company.

          (b)  [Reserved]

          (c)  In connection with such conveyances by the Seller, the Seller
shall on behalf of and at the direction of the Company deliver to, and deposit
with the Custodian on behalf of the Trustee, on or before the Closing Date in
the case of a Closing Date Mortgage Loan and two Business Days prior to the
related Subsequent Transfer Date in the case of a Subsequent Mortgage Loan, the
following documents or instruments with respect to each Mortgage Loan (the
"Mortgage File"):

               (i)  the original Mortgage Note endorsed to "JPMorgan Chase Bank,
as Trustee of the NovaStar Mortgage Funding Trust, Series 2003-1, relating to
the NovaStar Home Equity Loan Asset-Backed Certificates, Series 2003-1";

                                        2

<PAGE>

               (ii)  the original Mortgage with evidence of recording thereon,
or, if the original Mortgage has not yet been returned from the public recording
office, a copy of the original Mortgage certified by the Seller or the public
recording office in which such original Mortgage has been recorded and if the
Mortgage Loan is registered on the MERS System, such Mortgage shall include
thereon a statement that it is a MOM Loan and shall include the MIN for such
Mortgage Loan;

               (iii) unless the Mortgage Loan is registered on the MERS System,
an original assignment (which may be included in one or more blanket assignments
if permitted by applicable law) of the Mortgage endorsed to "JPMorgan Chase
Bank, as Trustee of the NovaStar Mortgage Funding Trust, Series 2003-1, relating
to the NovaStar Home Equity Loan Asset-Backed Certificates, Series 2003-1", and
otherwise in recordable form;

               (iv)  originals of any intervening assignments of the Mortgage
showing an unbroken chain of title from the originator thereof to the Person
assigning it to the Trustee (or to MERS, if the Mortgage Loan is registered on
the MERS System, and noting the presence of a MIN, if the Mortgage Loan is
registered on the MERS System), with evidence of recording thereon, or, if the
original of any such intervening assignment has not yet been returned from the
public recording office, a copy of such original intervening assignment
certified by the Seller or the public recording office in which such original
intervening assignment has been recorded;

               (v)   the original policy of title insurance (or a commitment for
title insurance, if the policy is being held by the title insurance company
pending recordation of the Mortgage);

               (vi)  true and correct copy of each assumption, modification,
consolidation or substitution agreement, if any, relating to the Mortgage Loan;
and

               (vii) an executed copy of the notice of assignment and
acknowledgement of assignment with respect to the Mortgage Loans covered by the
MI Policies.

          If a material defect in any Mortgage File is discovered which may
materially and adversely affect the value of the related Mortgage Loan, or the
interests of the Trustee (as pledgee of the Mortgage Loans), or the
Certificateholders in such Mortgage Loan, including if any document required to
be delivered to the Custodian has not been delivered (provided that a Mortgage
File will not be deemed to contain a defect for an unrecorded assignment under
clause (i) above for 180 days following submission of the assignment if the
Seller has submitted such assignment for recording pursuant to the terms of the
following paragraph), the Seller shall cure such defect, repurchase the related
Mortgage Loan at the Repurchase Price or substitute an Eligible Substitute
Mortgage Loan for the related Mortgage Loan upon the same terms and conditions
set forth in Section 3.01 hereof as to the Closing Date Mortgage Loans and the
Subsequent Mortgage Loans and Section 2.02(c) hereof as to the Subsequent
Mortgage Loans for breaches of representations and warranties.

          Promptly after the Closing Date in the case of a Closing Date Mortgage
Loan or, in the case of a Subsequent Mortgage Loan, promptly after the
Subsequent Transfer Date (or after the date of transfer of any Eligible
Substitute Mortgage Loan), the Seller at its own expense

                                        3

<PAGE>

shall complete and submit for recording in the appropriate public office for
real property records each of the assignments referred to in clause (i) above,
with such assignment completed in favor of the Trustee, excluding any Mortgage
Loan that is registered on the MERS System if MERS is identified on the Mortgage
or on a properly recorded assignment of Mortgage as the mortgagee of record.
While such assignment to be recorded is being recorded, the Custodian shall
retain a photocopy of such assignment. If any assignment is lost or returned
unrecorded to the Custodian because of any defect therein, the Seller is
required to prepare a substitute assignment or cure such defect, as the case may
be, and the Seller shall cause such substitute assignment to be recorded in
accordance with this paragraph.

          In instances where an original Mortgage or any original intervening
assignment of Mortgage is not, in accordance with clause (ii) or (iv) above,
delivered by the Seller to the Custodian, on behalf of the Trustee, prior to or
on the Closing Date in the case of a Closing Date Mortgage Loan or, in the case
of a Subsequent Mortgage Loan, prior to or on the Subsequent Transfer Date, the
Seller will deliver or cause to be delivered the originals of such documents to
the Custodian, on behalf of the Trustee, promptly upon receipt thereof.

          In connection with the assignment of any Closing Date Mortgage Loan
registered on the MERS System, promptly after the Closing Date, the Seller
further agrees that it will cause, at the Seller's own expense, the MERS System
to indicate that such Closing Date Mortgage Loan has been assigned by the Seller
to the Trustee in accordance with this Agreement for the benefit of the
Certificateholders by including in such computer files (a) the applicable
Trustee code in the field "Trustee" which identifies the Trustee and (b) the
code "NovaStar 2003-1" (or its equivalent) in the field "Pool Field" which
identifies the series of the Certificates issued in connection with such
Mortgage Loans.

          Effective on the Closing Date, the Company hereby acknowledges its
acceptance of all right, title and interest to the Closing Date Mortgage Loans
and other property, existing on the Closing Date and thereafter created and
conveyed to it pursuant to this Section 2.01.

          The Trustee, as assignee or transferee of the Company, shall be
entitled to all scheduled principal payments due after the Cut-off Date, all
other payments of principal due and collected after the Cut-off Date, and all
payments of interest on the Closing Date Mortgage Loans. No scheduled payments
of principal due on or before the Cut-off Date and collected after the Cut-off
Date shall belong to the Company pursuant to the terms of this Purchase
Agreement. The Pooling and Servicing Agreement shall provide that any late
payment charges collected in connection with a Mortgage Loan shall be paid to
the Servicer as provided therein.

          (d) The parties hereto intend that the transactions set forth herein
constitute a sale by the Seller to the Company on the Closing Date of all the
Seller's right, title and interest in and to the Closing Date Mortgage Loans and
other property as and to the extent described above. In the event the
transactions set forth herein shall be deemed not to be a sale, the Seller
hereby grants to the Company as of the Closing Date a security interest in all
of the Seller's right, title and interest in, to and under the Closing Date
Mortgage Loans and such other property, to secure all of the Seller's
obligations hereunder and this Purchase Agreement shall constitute a security
agreement under applicable law and in such event, the parties hereto acknowledge
that the Custodian, in addition to holding the Closing Mortgage Loans on behalf
of the Trustee for the

                                        4

<PAGE>

benefit of the Certificateholders, holds the Closing Date Mortgage Loans as
designee of the Company. The Seller agrees to take or cause to be taken such
actions and to execute such documents, including without limitation the filing
of all necessary UCC-1 financing statements filed in the Commonwealth of
Virginia (which shall have been submitted for filing as of the Closing Date and
each Subsequent Transfer Date, as applicable), any continuation statements with
respect thereto and any amendments thereto required to reflect a change in the
name or corporate structure of the Seller, as are necessary to perfect and
protect the interests of the Company and their respective assignees in each
Closing Date Mortgage Loan and the proceeds thereof and the interests of the
Trustee and its assignees in each Subsequent Mortgage Loan and the proceeds
thereof. The Company agrees to take or cause to be taken such actions and to
execute such documents, including without limitation the filing of all necessary
UCC-1 financing statements, and continuation statements with respect thereto and
any amendments thereto as are necessary to perfect and protect the interests of
the Trustee and its assignees in each Closing Date Mortgage Loan.

          Section 2.02   Conveyance of the Subsequent Mortgage Loans.

          (a) Subject to the conditions set forth in paragraph (b) below in
consideration of the Trustee's delivery on the related Subsequent Transfer Dates
of all or a portion of the balance of funds in the Pre-Funding Account, the
Seller shall on any Subsequent Transfer Date sell, transfer, assign, set over
and convey, without recourse, to the Company, who shall then sell, transfer,
assign, set over and convey, without recourse, to the Trustee, but subject to
the other terms and provisions of this Purchase Agreement, all of the right,
title and interest of the Seller in and to (i) the Subsequent Mortgage Loans
(and the related MI Policies) identified on the related Mortgage Loan Schedule
attached to the related Subsequent Transfer Instrument delivered by the Seller
on such Subsequent Transfer Date, (ii) principal due and interest accruing on
the Subsequent Mortgage Loans after the related Subsequent Cut-off Date and (i)
with respect to such Subsequent Mortgage Loans all items to be delivered
pursuant to Section 2.01(c) above and the other items in the related Mortgage
Files; provided, however, that the Seller reserves and retains all right, title
and interest in and to principal received and interest accruing on the
Subsequent Mortgage Loans prior to the related Subsequent Cut-off Date. The
transfer by the Seller to the Company, and by the Company to the Trustee, of the
Subsequent Mortgage Loans identified on each Mortgage Loan Schedule attached to
the related Subsequent Transfer instrument shall be absolute and is intended by
the Trustee, the Company and the Seller to constitute and to be treated as a
sale of the Subsequent Mortgage Loans by the Seller to the Company, and a sale
of the Subsequent Mortgage Loans by the Company to the Trustee.

          In the event such transactions shall be deemed not to be a sale, the
Seller hereby grants to the Company as of each Subsequent Transfer Date a
security interest in all of the Seller's right, title and interest in, to and
under the related Subsequent Mortgage Loans and such other property, to secure
all of the Seller's obligations hereunder, and this Purchase Agreement shall
constitute a security agreement under applicable law, and in such event, the
parties hereto acknowledge that the Custodian, in addition to holding the
Subsequent Mortgage Loans and the related MI Policies on behalf of the Trustee
for the benefit of the Certificateholders, holds the Subsequent Mortgage Loans
and the related MI Policies as designee of the Company. The Seller agrees to
take or cause to be taken such actions and to execute such documents, including
without limitation the filing of all necessary UCC-1 financing statements filed
in the

                                        5

<PAGE>

Commonwealth of Virginia (which shall be submitted for filing as of the related
Subsequent Transfer Date), any continuation statements with respect thereto and
any amendments thereto required to reflect a change in the name or corporate
structure of the Seller or the filing of any additional UCC-1 financing
statements due to a change in the state of incorporation of the Seller as are
necessary to perfect and protect the interests of the Company and its assignees
in the Subsequent Mortgage Loans.

                  In the event such transactions shall be deemed not to be a
sale, the Company hereby grants to the Trustee as of each Subsequent Transfer
Date a security interest in all of the Company's right, title and interest in,
to and under the related Subsequent Mortgage Loans and such other property, to
secure all of the Company's obligations hereunder, and this Purchase Agreement
shall constitute a security agreement under applicable law, and in such event,
the parties hereto acknowledge that the Custodian, in addition to holding the
Subsequent Mortgage Loans and the related MI Policies on behalf of the Trustee
for the benefit of the Certificateholders, holds the Subsequent Mortgage Loans
and the related MI Policies as designee of the Trustee. The Company agrees to
take or cause to be taken such actions and to execute such documents, including
without limitation, the filing of all necessary UCC-1 financing statements filed
in the State of Delaware (which shall be submitted for filing as of the related
Subsequent Transfer Date), any continuation statements with respect thereto and
any amendments thereto required to reflect a change in the name or corporate
structure of the Company or the filing of any additional UCC-1 financing
statements due to a change in the state of incorporation of the Company as are
necessary to perfect and protect the interests of the Trustee and its assignees
in Subsequent Mortgage Loans.

                  The related Mortgage File for each Subsequent Mortgage Loan
shall be delivered to the Custodian, on behalf of the Trustee, prior to the
related Subsequent Transfer Date.

                  The Trustee on each Subsequent Transfer Date shall acknowledge
by signing receipt thereof its acceptance of all right, title and interest to
the related Subsequent Mortgage Loans and other property, existing on the
Subsequent Transfer Date and thereafter created, conveyed to it pursuant to this
Section 2.02.

                  The Trustee, as trustee of the Trust Fund, shall be entitled
to all scheduled principal payments due after each Subsequent Cut-off Date, all
other payments of principal due and collected after each related Subsequent
Cut-off Date, and all payments of interest on the Subsequent Mortgage Loans,
minus that portion of any such payment which is allocable to the period prior to
the related Subsequent Cut-off Date. No scheduled payments of principal due on
or before the related Subsequent Cut-off Date and collected after the related
Subsequent Cut-off Date shall belong to the Trust Fund pursuant to the terms of
this Purchase Agreement.

                  The purchase price paid by the Trustee, at the direction of
the Servicer and on behalf of the Trustee, from amounts released from the
Pre-Funding Account shall be one-hundred percent (100%) of the aggregate
Principal Balances of the Subsequent Mortgage Loans so transferred (as
identified on the Mortgage Loan Schedule attached to the related Subsequent
Transfer Instrument provided by the Seller).

                                        6

          (b) The Seller shall transfer to the Company, who shall transfer to
the Trustee, the Subsequent Mortgage Loans and the other property and rights
related thereto described in Section 2.02(a) above, and the Trustee shall cause

Subsequent Mortgage Loans as of the related Subsequent Cut-off Date and any
other information reasonably requested by the Trustee with respect to the
Subsequent Mortgage Loans;

              (ii)  the Seller shall have delivered to the Company, who shall
have delivered to the Trustee, who shall have delivered to the Custodian, a duly

insolvent by such transfers, nor shall they be aware of any pending insolvency;

              (iv)  such sale and transfer (i) does not cause the REMIC to fail

mortgage title insurance policy; no prior holder of the applicable Mortgage,

genuine, and each is the legal, valid and binding obligation of the maker
thereof, enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, receivership and other
similar laws relating to creditors' rights generally or by equitable principles
(regardless of whether such enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity

against the Mortgaged Property of the benefits of the security, including (i) in
the case of a Mortgage designated as a deed of trust, by trustee's sale, and

title to the property, subject to any applicable rights of redemption;

               (xxviii) With respect to each Mortgage constituting a deed of
trust, either a trustee, duly qualified under applicable law to serve as such,
has been properly designated and currently so serves and is named in such
Mortgage or if no duly qualified trustee has been properly designated and so
serves, the Mortgage contains satisfactory provisions for the appointment of
such trustee by the holder of the Mortgage at no cost or expense to such holder,
and no fees or expenses are or will become payable by the Certificateholders to
the trustee under the deed of trust, except in connection with a trustee's sale

Mortgage or the applicable Mortgage Note;

               (xxx)    The Mortgage Note is not and has not been secured by any
collateral, pledged account or other security other than real estate securing
the Mortgagor's obligations and no Mortgage Loan is secured by more than one
Mortgaged Property;

               (xxxi)   As of the Closing Date in the case of a Closing Date
Mortgage Loan and as of the related Subsequent Transfer Date in the case of a
Subsequent Mortgage Loan, the improvements upon each Mortgaged Property are
covered by a valid and existing hazard insurance policy substantially acceptable
to FNMA and acceptable to the Seller which policy provides for fire extended
coverage and such other hazards as are customary in the area where the Mortgaged
Property is located representing coverage in an amount not less than the lesser
of (A) the maximum insurable value of the improvements securing such Mortgage
Loan and (B) the outstanding Principal Balance of the related Mortgage Loan; if
the improvement on the Mortgaged Property is a condominium unit, it is included
under the coverage afforded by a blanket policy for the condominium project. All
individual insurance policies contain a standard mortgagee clause naming the
Seller or the original holder of the Mortgage, and its successors in interest,
as mortgagee, and the Seller has received no notice that any premiums due and
payable thereon have not been paid; the Mortgage obligates the Mortgagor
thereunder to maintain all such insurance at the Mortgagor's cost and expense,
and upon the Mortgagor's failure to do so, authorizes the holder of the Mortgage
to obtain and maintain such insurance at the Mortgagor's cost and expense and to
seek reimbursement therefor from the Mortgagor. There has been no act or
omission which would impair the coverage of any such policy, the benefits of the
endorsement provided for herein, or the validity and binding effect of either;

               (xxxii)  If the Mortgaged Property is in an area identified in
the Federal Register by the Federal Emergency Management Agency as having
special flood hazards, a flood insurance policy in a form meeting the
requirements of the current guidelines of

                                       16

<PAGE>

the Flood Insurance Administration is in effect with respect to such Mortgaged
Property with a generally acceptable carrier in an amount representing coverage
not less than the least of (A) the outstanding Principal Balance of the Mortgage
Loan, (B) the minimum amount required to compensate for damage or loss on a
replacement cost basis and (C) the maximum amount of flood coverage that is
available under federal law;

               (xxxiii)  Except for the Mortgage Loan referred to in clause
(xii) as being delinquent, there is no material monetary default, breach,
violation or event of acceleration existing under the Mortgage or the applicable
Mortgage Note; and no material event which, with the passage of time or with
notice and the expiration of any grace or cure period, would constitute a
material default, breach, violation or event of acceleration, and neither the
Seller, any of its affiliates nor any servicer or subservicer of any related
Mortgage Loan has waived any default, breach, violation or event of
acceleration; no foreclosure action is threatened or has been commenced with
respect to the Mortgage Loan;

               (xxxiv)   Each Mortgage Loan is being serviced by the Servicer;

other party to make any payments with respect to the related Mortgage Loan in
addition to the Monthly Payments required to be made by the applicable
Mortgagor;

the case of a Closing Date Mortgage Loan and as of the related Subsequent
Transfer Date in the case of a Subsequent Mortgage Loan, with respect to any
Mortgage Loan have been consolidated with the outstanding principal amount
secured by such Mortgage, and the secured principal amount, as consolidated,
bears a single interest rate and single repayment term reflected on the Mortgage
Loan Schedule. The consolidated principal amount does not exceed the original
principal amount of the Mortgage Loan. The Mortgage Note with respect to any
Mortgage Loan does not permit or obligate the Servicer to make future advances
to the Mortgagor at the option of the Mortgagor;

               (xxxvii)  The Seller has caused or will cause to be performed any
and all acts required to preserve the rights and remedies of the Company and the
Trustee evidencing an interest in the Mortgage Loans in any insurance policies
applicable to the Mortgage Loans including, without limitation, any necessary
notifications of insurers, assignments of policies or interests therein, and
establishments of coinsured, joint loss payee and mortgagee rights in favor of
Trustee;

               (xxxviii) Except as set forth in clause (xlii), there are no
defaults by the Mortgagor in complying with the terms of any Mortgage, and all
taxes, governmental assessments, insurance premiums, water, sewer and municipal
charges which previously became due and owing have been paid, or, if required by
the terms of the Mortgage Loan, an escrow of funds has been established in an
amount sufficient to pay for every such item which remains unpaid and which has
been assessed, but is not yet due and payable. Except for (A) payments in the
nature of escrow payments and (B) interest accruing from the date of the
Mortgage Note or date of disbursement of the Mortgage proceeds to the day which
precedes by one month the Due Date of the first installment of principal and
interest, including, without limitation, taxes and

the subject of an appraisal which conforms to the underwriting requirements of

interest on or in respect of any Closing Date Mortgage Loans (by Cut-off Date

               (xliv)  The Seller acquired any right, title and interest in and

               (xlv)   The Mortgage Note, the Mortgage, the related Assignment

material adverse effect on the market value of such Mortgaged Property. The
Seller has no knowledge of any pending action or proceeding directly involving

respect to a Mortgage Loan or a Related Document, either (A) repurchase such
Mortgage Loan from the Trustee at the Repurchase Price, or (B) substitute one or
more Eligible Substitute Mortgage Loans for such Mortgage Loan, in each case in
the manner and subject to the conditions and limitations set forth below.

         Upon discovery by the Seller or upon notice from the Company, the
Trustee, or the Custodian, as applicable, of a breach of any representation or
warranty in this subsection (b) with respect to any Mortgage Loan or upon the
occurrence of a Repurchase Event, which materially and adversely affects the

         In the event that the Seller elects to substitute an Eligible

Trustee, with respect to such Eligible Substitute Mortgage Loan or Loans, the
original Mortgage Note and all other documents and agreements as are required by
Section 2.01 hereof, with the Mortgage Note endorsed as required by such Section
2.01 hereof. No substitution will be made in any calendar month after the
Determination Date for such month. Monthly Payments due with respect to Eligible
Substitute Mortgage Loans in the month of substitution shall not be part of the

the Seller on the next succeeding Payment Date. For the month of substitution,
distributions to the Payment Account pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement will include the Monthly Payment due on a Deleted Mortgage Loan for
such month and thereafter the Seller shall be entitled to retain all amounts
received in respect of such Deleted Mortgage Loan. The Servicer shall amend or

Deleted Mortgage Loan and the substitution of the Eligible

                                       22

<PAGE>

Substitute Mortgage Loan or Loans and the Servicer shall deliver the amended
Mortgage Loan Schedule to the Custodian and the Trustee. Upon such substitution,
the Eligible Substitute Mortgage Loan or Loans shall be subject to the terms of
this Purchase Agreement and the Pooling and Servicing Agreement in all respects,
the Seller shall be deemed to have made the representations and warranties with
respect to the Eligible Substitute Mortgage Loan contained herein set forth in
this Section 3.01(b), to the extent set forth in the definition of "Eligible
Substitute Mortgage Loan", as of the date of substitution, and the Seller shall
be obligated to repurchase or substitute for any Eligible Substitute Mortgage
Loan as to which a Repurchase Event has occurred as provided herein. In
connection with the substitution of one or more Eligible Substitute Mortgage
Loans for one or more Deleted Mortgage Loans, the Servicer will determine the
amount (such amount, a "Substitution Adjustment Amount"), if any, by which the
aggregate principal balance of all such Eligible Substitute Mortgage Loans as of
the date of substitution is less than the aggregate principal balance of all
such Deleted Mortgage Loans (after application of the principal portion of the
Monthly Payments due in the month of substitution that are to be distributed to
the Payment Account in the month of substitution). The Seller shall pay the
amount of such shortfall to the Servicer for deposit into the Collection Account
on the day of substitution, without any reimbursement therefor.

         Upon receipt by the Trustee of written notification, signed by a
Servicing Officer, of the deposit of such Repurchase Price or of such
substitution of an Eligible Substitute Mortgage Loan and deposit of any
applicable Substitution Adjustment Amount as provided above, the Custodian
shall, on behalf of the Trustee, cause to be released to the Seller the related
Mortgage File for the Mortgage Loan being repurchased or substituted for and the
Trustee shall execute and deliver such instruments of transfer or assignment
prepared by the Servicer, in each case without recourse, as shall be necessary
to vest in the Seller or its designee such Mortgage Loan released pursuant
hereto and thereafter such Mortgage Loan shall not be an asset of the Trustee.

         It is understood and agreed that the obligation of the Seller to cure
any breach with respect to or to repurchase or substitute for, any Mortgage Loan
as to which such a breach has occurred and is continuing shall, except to the
extent provided in Section 6.01 of this Purchase Agreement, constitute the sole
remedy respecting such breach available to the Company, the Trustee, the
Certificateholders or the Custodian against the Seller.

         It is understood and agreed that the representations and warranties set
forth in this Section 3.01 shall survive delivery of the respective Mortgage
Files to the Custodian on behalf of the Trustee.

         Section 3.02 Company Representations and Warranties.

                  (a) Except as provided in Section 7.01(b) hereof, the

notice to the Seller, at any time at or prior to the Closing Date:

                      (i)   if the Underwriting Agreement is terminated by the
Underwriters pursuant to the terms of the Underwriting Agreement or if there has
been, since the time of execution of this Purchase Agreement or since the
respective dates as of which information is given in the Prospectus, any
material adverse change in the financial condition, earnings, business affairs
or business prospects of the Seller, whether or not arising in the ordinary
course of business, or

                      (ii)  if there has occurred any material adverse change in
the financial markets in the United States, any outbreak of hostilities or
escalation thereof or other calamity or crisis or any change or development
involving a prospective change in national or international political, financial
or economic conditions, in each case the effect of which is such as to make it,
in the judgment of the Underwriters, impracticable to market the Class A
Certificates and Mezzanine Certificates or to enforce contracts for the sale of
the Class A Certificates and Mezzanine Certificates, or

                      (iii) if trading in any securities of the Seller has been
suspended or limited by the Commission or the New York Stock Exchange, or if
trading generally on the American Stock Exchange or the New York Stock Exchange
or in the NASDAQ National Market System has been suspended or limited, or
minimum or maximum prices for trading have been fixed, or maximum ranges for

                      (v)   either (A) a change in control of the Seller shall
have occurred other than in connection with and as a result of the issuance and
sale by the Seller or registered, publicly offered common stock; or (B) the
Underwriters determine in their sole discretion that any material adverse change
has occurred in the management of the Seller,

                      (vi)  there is (A) a material breach by the Seller of any
representation and warranty contained in this Purchase Agreement or the
Underwriting Agreement other than a representation or warranty relating to
particular Mortgage Loans, and the Underwriters have

                                       27

<PAGE>

reason to believe in good faith either that such breach is not curable within
two (2) days or that such breach may not have been cured in all material
respects at the expiration of two (2) days following discovery thereof by the
Seller or (B) a failure by the Seller to make any payment payable by it under
this Purchase Agreement or (C) any other failure by the Seller to observe and
perform in any material respect its material covenants, agreements and
obligations with the Company, including without limitation those contained in
this Purchase Agreement, and the Company has reason to believe in good faith
that such failure may not have been cured in all material respects at the
expiration of two (2) days following discovery thereof by the Seller, or

                      (vii) the Seller fails to provide written notification to
the Underwriters of any change in its loan origination, acquisition or appraisal
guidelines or practices, or the Seller, without the prior consent of the
Underwriters (which shall not be unreasonably withheld), amends in any material
respect its loan origination, acquisition or appraisal guidelines or practices.

                  If this Purchase Agreement is terminated pursuant to this
Section 7.01(b), such termination shall be without liability of any party to any
other party except as provided in Section 4.02 hereof.

                  Section 8.08 Intention of the Parties.

                  It is the intention of the parties that (i) the Company is
purchasing on the Closing Date, and the Seller is selling on the Closing Date,
the Closing Date Mortgage Loans, rather than the Company providing to the Seller
a loan secured by the Closing Date Mortgage Loans on the Closing Date, and (ii)
the Trustee is purchasing on the Closing Date, and the Company is selling on the
Closing Date, the Closing Date Mortgage Loans, rather than the Trustee providing
to the Company a loan secured by the Closing Date Mortgage Loans, (iii) the
Company will be purchasing on each Subsequent Transfer Date, and the Seller will
be selling on each Subsequent Transfer Date, the related Subsequent Mortgage
Loans, rather than the Company providing to the Seller a loan secured by the
related Subsequent Mortgage Loans on each Subsequent Transfer Date, and (iv) the
Trustee will be purchasing on each Subsequent Transfer Date, and the Company
will be selling on each Subsequent Transfer Date, the related Subsequent
Mortgage Loans, rather than the Trustee providing to the Company a loan secured
by the related Subsequent Mortgage Loans on each Subsequent Transfer Date.
Accordingly, the parties hereto each intend to treat these transactions as (i) a
sale by the Seller, and a purchase by the Company, of the Closing Date Mortgage
Loans on the Closing Date, and (ii) a sale by the Company, and a purchase by the
Trustee, of the Closing Date Mortgage Loans on the Closing Date, (iii) a sale by
the Seller, and a purchase by the Company, of the related Subsequent Mortgage
Loans on each Subsequent Transfer Date, and (iv) a sale by the Company, and a
purchase by the Trustee, of the related Subsequent Mortgage Loans on each
Subsequent Transfer Date.

                  Section 8.09 Successors and Assigns; Assignment of Purchase
Agreement.

                  This Purchase Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of
and be enforceable by the Seller, the Company, the Trustee, the Custodian, and
their respective successors and assigns. The obligations of the Seller under
this Purchase Agreement cannot be assigned or delegated to a third party without
the consent of the Company, which consent shall be at the Company's discretion.
The parties hereto acknowledge that (i) the Company is acquiring the Closing
Date Mortgage Loans for the purpose of selling them to the Trustee, who will
hold the Closing Date Mortgage Loans in trust for the benefit of the
Certificateholders and (ii) the Company is acquiring the Subsequent Mortgage
Loans for the purpose of selling them to the Trustee, who will hold the
Subsequent Mortgage Loans for the benefit of the Certificateholders. As an
inducement to the Company and the Trustee to purchase the Mortgage Loans, the
Seller acknowledges and consents to (i) the assignment by the Company to the
Trustee of all of the Company's rights or remedies against the Seller pursuant
to this Purchase Agreement and to (ii) the enforcement or exercise of any rights
against the Seller pursuant to this Purchase Agreement by the Company and the
Trustee. Such enforcement of a right or remedy by the Trustee, shall have the
same force and effect as if the right or remedy had been enforced or exercised
by the Company directly.

                  Section 8.10 Survival.

                  The representations and warranties made herein by the Seller
and the provisions of Article V hereof shall survive the purchase of the
Mortgage Loans hereunder.

                  Section 8.11 Liability of the Trustee.

                  The Trustee is entering into the Basic Documents to which it
is a party solely as Trustee, hereunder and thereunder, and not in its
individual capacity, and all persons having any claim against the Trustee by
reason of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any other Basic
Document shall look only to the Trust Fund for payment or satisfaction thereof.

                     SELLER'S SUBSEQUENT TRANSFER INSTRUMENT

         Pursuant to this Seller's Subsequent Transfer Instrument (the "Seller's
Instrument"), dated as of February 1, 2003, between NovaStar Mortgage, Inc. as
seller (the "Seller"), and NovaStar Mortgage Funding Corporation, as company
(the "Company"), and pursuant to the Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement, dated as
of February 1, 2003 (the "Purchase Agreement"), among the Seller, the Company,
Wachovia Bank, National Association, as Custodian (the "Custodian") and JPMorgan
Chase Bank, as Trustee (the "Trustee"), the Seller and the Company agree to the
sale by the Seller and the purchase by the Company of the subsequent Mortgage
Loans listed on the attached Mortgage Loan Schedule (the "Subsequent Mortgage
Loans") and the related MI Policies.

         Capitalized terms used and not defined herein have their respective
meanings as set forth in the definitions contained in the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement, dated as of February 1, 2003 (the "Pooling and Servicing Agreement"),
between the Trustee, the Custodian, the Company and the Seller/Servicer which
definitions are incorporated by reference herein. All other capitalized terms
used herein shall have the meanings specified herein.

         Section 1. Conveyance of Subsequent Mortgage Loans.

         (a) The Seller does hereby sell, transfer, assign, set over and convey
to the Company, without recourse, all of its right, title and interest in and to
the Subsequent Mortgage Loans and the related MI Policies, all scheduled
payments of principal and interest on the Subsequent Mortgage Loans due after
the Subsequent Cut-off Date, and all other payments of principal and interest on
the Subsequent Mortgage Loans collected after the Subsequent Cut-off Date (minus
that portion of any such payment which is allocable to the period prior to the
Subsequent Cut-off Date); provided, however, that no scheduled payments of
principal and interest due on or before the Subsequent Cut-off Date and
collected after the Subsequent Cut-off Date shall belong to the Company pursuant
to the terms of this Seller's Instrument. The Seller, contemporaneously with the
delivery of this Seller's Instrument, has delivered or caused to be delivered to
the Custodian, at the direction of the Company, each item set forth in Section
2.02(b) of the Purchase Agreement with respect to such Subsequent Mortgage Loans
and the related MI Policies. The transfer to the Company by the Seller of the
Subsequent Mortgage Loans identified on the attached Mortgage Loan Schedule
shall be absolute and is intended by the Seller, the Company, the Custodian, the
Trustee and the Certificateholders to constitute and to be treated as a sale by
the Seller.

         The parties hereto intend that the transactions set forth herein
constitute a sale by the Seller to the Company on the Subsequent Transfer Date
of all the Seller's right, title and interest in and to the Subsequent Mortgage
Loans and the related MI Policies, and other property as and to the extent
described above. In the event the transactions set forth herein shall be deemed
not to be a sale, the Seller hereby grants to the Company as of the Subsequent
Transfer Date a security interest in all of the Seller's right, title and
interest in, to and under the Subsequent Mortgage Loans, and such other
property, to secure all of the Seller's obligations hereunder, and this Purchase
Agreement shall constitute a security agreement under applicable


<PAGE>

law, and in such event, the parties hereto acknowledge that the Custodian, in
addition to holding the Subsequent Mortgage Loans and the related MI Policies on
behalf of the Trustee for the benefit of the Certificateholders, holds the
Subsequent Mortgage Loans and the related MI Policies as designee and agent of
the Company. The Seller agrees to take or cause to be taken such actions and to
execute such documents, including without limitation the filing of all necessary
UCC-1 financing statements filed in the State of Maryland (which shall be
submitted for filing as of the Subsequent Transfer Date), any continuation
statements with respect thereto and any amendments thereto required to reflect a
change in the name or corporate structure of the Seller or the filing of any
additional UCC-1 financing statements due to the change in the state of
incorporation of the Seller as are necessary to perfect and protect the
interests of the Company and its assignees in each Subsequent Mortgage Loan, the
related MI Policies and the proceeds thereof.

         (b) The expenses and costs relating to the delivery of the Subsequent
Mortgage Loans, this Seller's Instrument and such other items required under the
Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement shall be borne by the Seller.

         (c) Additional terms of the sale are set forth on Attachment A hereto.

         Section 2. Representations and Warranties; Conditions Precedent.

         (a) The Seller hereby affirms the representations and warranties set
forth in Section 3.01 of the Purchase Agreement that relate to the Seller and
the Subsequent Mortgage Loans as of the date hereof. The Seller hereby confirms
that each of the conditions set forth in Section 2.02(b) of the Purchase
Agreement are satisfied as of the date hereof and further represents and
warrants that each Subsequent Mortgage Loan complies with the requirements of
this Seller's Instrument and Section 2.02(c) of the Purchase Agreement.

         (b) The Seller is solvent, is able to pay its debts as they become due
and has capital sufficient to carry on its business and its obligations
hereunder; it will not be rendered insolvent by the execution and delivery of
this Seller's Instrument or by the performance of its obligations hereunder nor
is it aware of any pending insolvency; no petition of bankruptcy (or similar
insolvency proceeding) has been filed by or against the Seller prior to the date
hereof;

         (c) All terms and conditions of the Purchase Agreement are hereby
ratified and confirmed; provided, however, that in the event of any conflict the
provisions of this Seller's Instrument shall control over the conflicting

                    COMPANY'S SUBSEQUENT TRANSFER INSTRUMENT

          Pursuant to this Company's Subsequent Transfer Instrument (the
"Company's Instrument"), dated as of _________ __, 2002, between NovaStar
Mortgage Funding Corporation, as company (the "Company"), and JPMorgan Chase
Bank, as trustee (the "Trustee"), and pursuant to the Mortgage Loan Purchase
Agreement, dated as of February 1, 2003 (the "Purchase Agreement"), among
NovaStar Mortgage, Inc., as seller (the "Seller"), the Company, Wachovia Bank,
National Association, as Custodian ("Custodian"), and JPMorgan Chase Bank, as
Trustee (the "Trustee"), the Company and the Trustee agree to the sale by the
Company and the purchase by the Trustee of the subsequent Mortgage Loans listed
on the attached Mortgage Loan Schedule (the "Subsequent Mortgage Loans") and the
related MI Policies, and the pledge of the Subsequent Mortgage Loans by the
Trustee.

          Capitalized terms used and not defined herein have their respective
meanings as set forth in the definitions contained in the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement, dated as of February 1, 2003 (the "Pooling and Servicing Agreement"),
between the Custodian, the Trustee, the Company and the Servicer which
definitions are incorporated by reference herein. All other capitalized terms
used herein shall have the meanings specified herein.

          Section 1. Conveyance of Subsequent Mortgage Loans.

          (a) The Company does hereby sell, transfer, assign, set over and
convey to the Trustee, without recourse, (i) all of its right, title and
interest in and to the Subsequent Mortgage Loans and the related MI Policies,
all scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Subsequent Mortgage
Loans due after the Subsequent Cut-off Date, and all other payments of principal
and interest on the Subsequent Mortgage Loans collected after the Subsequent
Cut-off Date (minus that portion of any such payment which is allocable to the
period prior to the Subsequent Cut-off Date); provided, however, that no
scheduled payments of principal and interest due on or before the Subsequent
Cut-off Date and collected after the Subsequent Cut-off Date shall belong to the
Trustee pursuant to the terms of this Company's Instrument and (ii) all of its
right, title and interest in and to the Seller's Subsequent Transfer Instrument,
dated as of ______ __, 2003 (the "Seller's Instrument"), between the Seller and
the Company. The Company, contemporaneously with the delivery of this Company's
Instrument, has delivered or caused to be delivered to the Custodian each item
set forth in Section 2.02(b) of the Purchase Agreement with respect to such
Subsequent Mortgage Loans. The transfer to the Trustee by the Company of the
Subsequent Mortgage Loans identified on the attached Mortgage Loan Schedule and
the related MI Policies shall be absolute and is intended by the Company, the
Trustee, the Custodian and the Certificateholders to constitute and to be
treated as a sale by the Company.

          The parties hereto intend that the transactions set forth herein
constitute a sale by the Company to the Trustee on the Subsequent Transfer Date
of all the Company's right, title and interest in and to the Subsequent Mortgage
Loans and the related MI Policies, and other property as and to the extent
described above. In the event the transactions set forth herein shall be deemed
not to be a sale, the Company hereby grants to the Trustee as of the Subsequent
Transfer Date a security interest in all of the Company's right, title and
interest in, to and under the

<PAGE>

Subsequent Mortgage Loans, and such other property, to secure all of the
Company's obligations hereunder, and this Company's Instrument shall constitute
a security agreement under applicable law, and in such event, the parties hereto
acknowledge that the Custodian on behalf of the Trustee, in addition to holding
the Subsequent Mortgage Loans and the related MI Policies for the benefit of the
Certificateholders, holds the Subsequent Mortgage Loans and the related MI
Policies as designee and agent of the Trustee. The Company agrees to take or
cause to be taken such actions and to execute such documents, including without
limitation the filing of all necessary UCC-1 financing statements filed in the
State of Delaware (which shall be submitted for filing as of the Subsequent
Transfer Date), any continuation statements with respect thereto and any
amendments thereto required to reflect a change in the name or corporate
structure of the Company or the filing of any additional UCC-1 financing
statements due to the change in the state of incorporation of the Company as are
necessary to perfect and protect the interests of the Trustee and its assignees
in each Subsequent Mortgage Loan, the related MI Policies and the proceeds
thereof.

          (b) The expenses and costs relating to the delivery of the Subsequent
Mortgage Loans, this Company's Instrument and such other items required under
the Purchase Agreement shall be borne by the Company.

          Section 2. Representations and Warranties; Conditions Precedent.

          (a) The Company hereby affirms the representations and warranties set
forth in Section 3.02 of the Purchase Agreement that relate to the Company as of
the date hereof.

          (b) The Company is solvent, is able to pay its debts as they become
due and has capital sufficient to carry on its business and its obligations
hereunder; it will not be rendered insolvent by the execution and delivery of
this Company's Instrument or by the performance of its obligations hereunder nor
is it aware of any pending insolvency; no petition of bankruptcy (or similar
insolvency proceeding) has been filed by or against the Company prior to the
date hereof;

          (c) All terms and conditions of the Purchase Agreement are hereby
ratified and confirmed; provided, however, that in the event of any conflict the
provisions of this Company's Instrument shall control over the conflicting
provisions of the Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement.

          Section 3. Recordation of Instrument.

          To the extent permitted by applicable law, this Company's Instrument,
or a memorandum thereof if permitted under applicable law, is subject to
recordation in all appropriate public offices for real property records in all
of the counties or other comparable jurisdictions in which any or all of the
