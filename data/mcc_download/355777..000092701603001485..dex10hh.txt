                                  EXHIBIT 10hh.

                           AMENDMENT TO LOAN AGREEMENT

        This AGREEMENT (the "Amendment"), effective November 30, 2002, amends a
certain Loan Agreement (the "Loan Agreement") executed September 5, 2002 (and
stated to take effect as of October 4, 2001) entered into by and among Car
Security S.A., an Argentina corporation (the "Borrower"), LoJack Recovery
Systems Business Trust ("Lender"), a Massachusetts business trust and a
subsidiary of LoJack Corporation, LoJack Corporation, a Massachusetts
corporation, Mr. Carlos Mackinlay and Mr. Roberto Bonanni Rey (together, the
"Parties"). Defined terms used herein and not specifically defined shall have
the meaning set forth in the Loan Agreement.

WHEREAS, the Parties have agreed to change certain provisions of the Loan
Agreement and related agreements;

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the undertakings herein, the Parties hereby
agree as follows:

1.      Balance Due.

        (a)     On the date of this Amendment, the Amount Due from Borrower to
                Lender is US$ l,749,248.

2.      Division of the Amount Due.

        (a)     The Amount Due hereunder shall be divided into two parts, with
                differing payment terms. Each such obligation shall be
                represented by a new demand promissory note, designated as the
                Dollar Note and the Peso Calculated Note and in the forms
                annexed hereto as Exhibit A and Exhibit B, respectively. The
                original Note shall be cancelled and delivered to the Borrower
                upon the execution and delivery of this Amendment, the Dollar
                Note and the Peso Calculated Note.

        (b)     The Dollar Note shall be in the amount of US$ 716,512 and shall
                be due December 31, 2009. This amount reflects a deferral of a
                portion of the purchase price of 13,147 LoJack Units (the
                "Subject SVRUs") purchased by Borrower from Lender.

        (c)     The remaining amount of US$ 1,032,736 shall be represented by a
                note (the "Peso Calculated Note") due December 31, 2009. The
                Peso Calculated Note shall be paid and adjusted as provided
                herein.

3.      Interest.

        (a)     Interest shall accrue on the outstanding and unpaid principal
                amount of each of the Dollar Note and the Peso Calculated Note
                (collectively, the "Notes") at the rate of one percent (1%)
                above the Prime Rate (as published, from time to time, by
                Citizens Bank), compounded monthly, as provided in the Notes,
                with interest on Default (as herein defined) accruing at the
                rate set forth in the Notes. All payments, including payments in
                accordance with Section 4, shall be applied first to accrued
                interest and then to principal.

        (b)     The provisions of this Section 3 supersede the provisions of
                Section 3 of the Loan Agreement

4.      Payments, and Mandatory Pre-payment.

        (a)     Borrower shall repay to Lender the principal amount of the
                Dollar Note and shall pay all interest accrued thereon and all
                other amounts payable to Lender pursuant to the terms of the
                Loan Agreement, as amended, or the Dollar Note on or before
                December 31, 2009 (the "Dollar Repayment Date"), subject to
                acceleration as provided in Section 4(f).

<PAGE>

        (b)     Borrower shall pay to Lender in US$ in Westwood Massachusetts,
                USA, monthly, for application against the Dollar Note, within
                twenty-five (25) days of the end of each month, an amount
                determined as follows: a sum equal to the lesser of (i) five
                percent (5%) of Borrower's total monthly gross revenue for such
                month (less only VAT), or (ii) seventeen and one-half percent
                (17.5%) of its average per unit recurring or recovery fees for
                such month, multiplied by 13,147 (representing the number of
                Subject SVRUs). Such amount shall be paid in US$, converted at
                the market rate as determined by Citizens Bank on the date of
                payment, subject to the provisions of Section 7. The actual US$
                payments, when received by Lender, shall be credited against the
                amount due on the Dollar Note. In order to share business risks
                and benefits, Borrower shall continue to make such payments
                through December 31, 2009 even if prior payments have resulted
                in the Dollar Note having been paid in full, and, provided that
                the Borrower makes all such payments through December 31, 2009,
                Lender then shall cancel the Dollar Note, even if it has not by
                then been paid in full. The parties recognize that the effect of
                the exchange rate limitations of Section 7 may be that Borrowers
                actual cost in P$ may exceed the five percent (5%) and seventeen
                and one-half percent (17.5%) limitations set forth above.

        (c)     Borrower shall repay to Lender the principal amount of the Peso
                Calculated Note and shall pay all interest accrued thereon and
                all other amounts payable to Lender pursuant to the terms of the
                Loan Agreement, as amended, or the Peso Calculated Note on or
                before December 31, 2009 (the "Peso Repayment Date"), subject to
                acceleration as provided in Section 4(g).

        (d)     Borrower shall pay to Lender in US$ in Westwood Massachusetts,
                USA, monthly, for application against the Peso Calculated Note,
                within twenty-five (25) days of the end of each month, an amount
                determined as follows: a sum equal to five percent (5%) of its
                total monthly gross revenue for such month (less only VAT)
                reduced, but not below zero, by the P$ amount which was the
                starting point for the calculation of any payment made pursuant
                to Section 4(b) for such month. The amount so determined, in P$,
                shall be applied against the Peso Calculated Note when payment
                in US$ is received by the Lender, until the balance remaining
                due on the Peso Calculated Note is reduced to zero as explained
                below, at which time Lender shall cancel the Peso Calculated
                Note. The starting point for calculation of the remaining
                balance of the Peso Calculated Note shall be the nominal sum of
                P$ 3,717,850, determined by applying an agreed rate of P$ 3.60
                per US$ to the balance described in Section 2 (c). Payment shall
                be made to Lender in the United States in US$, converted at the
                market rate, as determined by Citizens Bank on the date of
                payment, subject to the provisions of Section 7. Lender shall
                cancel the Peso Calculated Note once the amounts applied have
                reduced to zero the balance of principal and interest due from
                the starting point sum of P$ 3,717,850, provided, however, that
                any P$ needed by the Borrower to purchase US$ at a rate higher
                than the corresponding rate indicated in Exhibit C hereof shall
                not be credited against the remaining balance of principal and
                interest on the original sum of P$ 3,717,850. By way of example,
                if the determined amount of P$ pursuant to this Section 4(d) in
                January of 2003 is P$50,000, and the market rate is 5, the
                Borrower shall require P$51,759.83 to meet its payment
                obligation under the Peso Calculated Note for such month, but
                only P$50,000 shall be credited against the remaining balance of
                principal and interest on the original starting point of
                P$3,717,850. The parties recognize that the effect of the
                exchange rate limitations of Section 7 may be that Borrower's
                actual cost in P$ may exceed the five percent (5%) limitation
                set forth above and that the final amount of P$ needed to cancel
                the Peso Calculated Note may exceed P$3,717,850.

        (e)     Nothing contained in Section 4(d) shall be construed as
                relieving Borrower's obligations as set forth in Section 4(c).

        (f)     Upon the occurrence of a Default (as defined in Section 5), the
                Notes shall become due and payable immediately without
                presentment, demand, protest or notice, all of which are hereby
                waived by Borrower, (1) automatically in the case of Section
                5(f) or 5(g); and (2) at the election of Lender by notice to
                Borrower in the case of Sections 5(a) through 5(e).

<PAGE>

        (g)     The Peso Calculated Note may be prepaid at any time, without
                premium or penalty, upon three (3) business days notice, which
                notice of prepayment shall be irrevocable.

        (h)     The provisions of this Section 4 supersede the provisions of
                Section 5 of the Loan Agreement.

5.      Default; Consequences of Default.

        Each of the following events shall constitute an immediate default (a
        "Default") under the Loan Agreement, as amended, and the Notes, unless
        waived by Lender:

        (a)     Borrower shall fail to pay any amount as and when the same shall
                become due pursuant to the terms of the Notes and the Loan
                Agreement, as amended, and such amount shall remain unpaid for a
                period of five (5) days;

        (b)     any representation or warranty of Borrower contained in the Loan
                Agreement shall have been incorrect in any material respect as
                of the date made;

        (c)     Borrower shall fail to provide Lender with immediate notice of
                its failure or inability to comply with any provision of Section
                7 of the Loan Agreement;

        (d)     Borrower shall materially default in the observance or
                performance of any other material agreement or covenant
                contained in the Loan Agreement, as amended, the Notes, the
                License Agreement or any other agreement with Lender or an
                affiliate of Lender, and such default shall not have been cured
                or waived within thirty (30) days of the occurrence of such
                default;

        (e)     Borrower shall materially deviate from the approved budget, or
                shall materially fail to achieve the approved projected cash
                flow for two consecutive quarters (in each case, as defined in
                the Loan Agreement);

        (f)     the entry of any decree or order by a court having jurisdiction
                adjudging Borrower a debtor or insolvent, or approving as
                properly filed a petition seeking reorganization, arrangement,
                adjustment or composition of or in respect of Borrower under
                Argentina Bankruptcy law Nbr. 24,522, as amended (the
                "Bankruptcy Law") or any other applicable federal or state law,
                the appointment of a receiver, liquidator, assignee, trustee,
                sequestrator or other similar official of Borrower, or of any
                substantial part of the property of Borrower, and the
                continuance of any such decree or order unstayed, undischarged,
                or undismissed and in effect for more than sixty (60)
                consecutive days; or

        (g)     institution by Borrower of proceedings, under the Bankruptcy Law
                or any other applicable federal or state law, seeking an order
                for relief, or the consent of Borrower to the institution of
                bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings against Borrower, or the
                consent by Borrower to the filing of any such petition or to the
                appointment of a receiver, liquidator, assignee, trustee,
                sequestrator or other similar official of or for Borrower or any
                substantial part of the property of Borrower, or the making by
                Borrower of any assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the
                admission by Borrower of Borrower's inability to pay its debts
                generally as they become due, or the taking of any action by
                Borrower in furtherance of any such action.

        (h)     Lender shall not make demand for payment of the Dollar Note or
                of the Peso Calculated Note except in the event of Default
                hereunder. In no event shall Lender make demand for more than
                the amount due pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement.

        (i)     The provisions of this Section 5 supersede the provisions of
                Section 6 of the Loan Agreement.

6.      Renewal of the License Agreement.

        Borrower is not in default under the Loan Agreement, as amended, or
        under the License Agreement, Lender agrees to consent to renewal for a
        period ending on the earlier of December 31, 2009 or the date of any
        default under the Loan Agreement, as amended. Except for such agreement,
        all provisions and conditions of the License Agreement shall remain in
        effect including, but not limited to, conditions relating to the
        Borrowers financial and technical ability, as licensee, to perform its
        obligations thereunder and rights of termination as set forth in the
        License Agreement. The terms of and such renewal agreement offered to
        Borrower by Lender may differ from the terms of the License Agreement,
        provided, however, that such terms shall not be materially less
        favorable to Borrower than the terms of agreements offered to other
        licensees or prospective licensees similarly situated at the time.

7.      Exchange Rate Protection.

        The provisions of Sections 4 (b) and 4 (d), above, for the conversion of
        Argentine Pesos to United States Dollars shall be subject to the
        limitation that the conversion rate used shall not be higher that the
        rate set forth on Exhibit C for such month, nor lower than three (3) P$
        per US$.

8.      Amendment to Stock Purchase Agreement.

        The parties agree that the date set forth in Section 11.1 (a) of that
        certain Stock Purchase Agreement of September 5, 2002, by and among
        LoJack Corporation, Mr. Carlos Mackinlay and Mr. Roberto Bonanni Rey is
        changed from August 31, 2003 to December 31, 2009.

9.      Continued effect of Guaranty and Pledges.

        The parties agree that the obligations set forth in a Guaranty of
        September 5, 2002 by Mr. Carlos Mackinlay and the obligations set forth
        in two Pledge and Security Agreements of September 5, 2002 each in favor
        of Lender and executed by Mr. Carlos Mackinlay and Mr. Roberto Bonanni
        Rey, respectively, remain in full force and effect with respect to the
        obligations set forth in the Loan Agreement as amended by this
        Amendment.

10.     Further Assurances.

        The Parties shall each execute and deliver such additional documents,
        and take such additional actions, as may be necessary from time to time
        to implement the provisions of this Agreement, provided that this
        Section 10 shall not alter the obligations and rights of the Parties
        hereunder.

11.     Continued Effectiveness.

        Except as specially amended herein, the License Agreement, the Loan
        Agreement, the Guaranty, the Pledge and Security Agreements, the Stock
        Purchase Agreement and all other agreements among the parties shall
        remain in full force and effect.

12.     Counterparts.

        number of separate counterparts and all of said counterparts taken
        together shall be deemed to constitute one and the same instrument.

US$ 716,512

                                       Buenos Aires, Argentina November 30, 2002

Said payment shall only be made in U.S. dollars (effective payment in foreign
currency clause, section 44, third paragraph, Decree 5965/63) to the order of
LoJack at its offices located at Westwood Executive Center, 200 Lowder Brook
Road, Suite 1000, Westwood, MA 02090.

Car Security shall also pay LoJack financing interest at an interest rate fixed
at one percent the prime rate published from time to time by Citizens Bank,
Boston, Massachusetts, compounded monthly.

In the event that, as a consequence of foreign exchange controls, restrictions
on the transfer of foreign currency from or to the Republic of Argentina or by
reason of any other action taken by a competent governmental body, we were
prevented from making the relevant payment in the currency agreed, we shall
deliver to the legitimated holder hereof, at the latter's option: a) External
Bonds of the Republic of Argentina or any other U.S. dollar-denominated
securities issued by the National Government of any series chosen by the
legitimated holder hereof, at its sole discretion, in such number and with such
nominal value as shall suffice so that upon the sale thereof in a foreign
market, at the option of the legitimated holder hereof, the proceeds in U.S.
dollars, net of all expenses, fees and/or taxes that may be payable by reason of
its transfer or sale, shall be equal to the amount in U.S. dollars payable; or
b) the amount in legal tender then in force in the Republic of Argentina as may
be required to acquire External Bonds of the Republic of Argentina or any other
U.S. dollar-denominated securities issued by the National Government of any
series chosen by the legitimated holder hereof, at its sole discretion, in such
number and with such nominal value as shall suffice so that upon the sale
thereof in a foreign market, at the option of the legitimated holder hereof, the
proceeds in U.S. dollars, net of all expenses, fees and/or taxes that may be
payable by reason of its transfer or sale, shall be equal to the amount in U.S.
dollars payable. In either case, any of the above procedures shall only be
regarded as a discharge of obligations once the legitimated holder hereof shall
have received the entire amount of U.S. dollars due hereunder.

Car Security expressly waives its right to invoke its inability to fulfill any
payment obligation based on acts of God or force majeure events (section 514 of
the Civil Code). Car Security further represents that, upon executing this
acknowledgement of obligations, it is fully familiar with the current economic
and financial conditions (including the exchange rate ratio among the Argentine
currency, the Euro and

<PAGE>

the U.S. dollar set forth in law 23.928 as amended by law 25.445), having
considered all possible consequences arising from those acts and having acted
with the independent advice it has deemed convenient, for which reason it
expressly waives the right to invoke hardship ("teoria de la imprevision") as
contemplated in section 1198 of the Argentine Civil Code, the unconscionability
theory and/or any other doctrine, concept or theory already established or which
may be established in the future either by law, case law or doctrine, which may
in any way release Car Security from the full, total and timely performance of
its obligations as acknowledged hereunder.

In case of lack of payment upon presentation of this promissory note, penalty
interest shall accrue hereon at a rate equal to 1.5 times the interest rate
charged by the Banco de la Nacion Argentina (Lending Rate) for discount
transactions of 30-day negotiable instruments.

For all legal purposes arising from this Promissory Note, Car Security
establishes special domicile at Avenida del Libertador 4600, 1426 Buenos Aires,
Argentina, where all notices served shall be deemed validly given. We expressly
accept that such domicile shall be regarded as our domicile ad litem for all
judicial purposes in the terms of section 40 and related sections of the
Argentine Code of Civil and Commercial Procedure. We submit to the jurisdiction
of the Ordinary First Instance Courts hearing Commercial Matters of the City of
Buenos Aires, expressly waiving any other venue or jurisdiction.

Pursuant to the provisions of section 36 of Executive Order 5965/63, the term
for presentation of this promissory note is extended to 9 years counted as from
the issuance date hereof.

This Promissory Note is issued under the terms of Decree 5965/63 of the Republic
of Argentina.
