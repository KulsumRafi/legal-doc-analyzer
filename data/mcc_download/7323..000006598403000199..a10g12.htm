  <p ALIGN="CENTER">METHODS OF ALLOCATING COSTS AMONG CLIENT COMPANIES RECEIVING
  SERVICE UNDER THIS AND SIMILAR SERVICE AGREEMENTS WITH ENTERGY SERVICES, INC.
  (SERVICES)</p>
  </font></b><font FACE="Courier New">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The costs of rendering service by Services will include all
costs of doing business including interest on debt but excluding a return for
the use of Services' initial equity capital amounting to $20,000.
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a) Services will maintain a separate record of the
expenses of each department. The expenses of each department will include:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i)&nbsp; those expenses that are directly attributable to
such department,
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii) an appropriate portion of those office and
housekeeping expenses that are not directly attributable to a department but
which are necessary to the operation of such department, and
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iii) an appropriate portion of those expenses of other
Services' departments necessary to support the operation of the department.
<ul>
  &nbsp; (b) Expenses of the department will include salaries and wages of
  employees,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; including social security
  taxes, vacations, paid absences, sickness, employee&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  disability expenses, and other employee welfare expenses, rent and utilities,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  desktops, telephones, materials and supplies, and all other expenses
  attributable to the department.
  <p>(c) Departmental expense will be categorized into one of three classes:
  <p>(i) those expenses which are directly attributable to specific services
  rendered to a Client Company or group of Client Companies (Departmental Direct
  Costs),&nbsp;
  <p>(ii) those expenses which are attributable to the overall operation of the
  department and not to a specific service provided to Client Companies
  (Departmental Indirect Costs) (these expenses include not only the salaries
  and wages of employees, but also other related employment costs described in
  Section 2 (b) above), and&nbsp;
  <p>(iii) those expenses which are attributable to the operation of other
  departments of Services as well as to a specific service provided to the
  Client Companies (Departmental Support Service Costs).
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <p>(d) The indirect expenses of the department will not include:&nbsp;
  <p>(i) those incremental out-of-pocket expenses that are incurred for the
  direct benefit and convenience of a Client Company or a group of Client
  Companies and&nbsp;
  <p>(ii) are to be directly charged to such Client Company or group of Client
  Companies; and Services' overhead expenses that are attributable to
  maintaining the corporate existence of Services, franchise and other general
  taxes, and all other incidental overhead expenses including those auditing
  fees and accounting department expenses attributable to Services (Indirect
  Corporate Costs).&nbsp;
  <p>(e) Services will establish annual budgets for controlling the expenses of
  each&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; service department and those expenses outlined above in
  Section 2 (d), which are&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not department specific.
  <p>3. Employees in each department will maintain a record of the time they are
  employed<br>
  in rendering service to each Client Company or group of Client Companies. The
  hourly rate for each employee will be determined each pay period.&nbsp;
  <p>4. (a) The charge to a Client Company or a group of Client Companies for a
  particular service will be the sum of the figures derived by multiplying the
  hours reported by each employee in rendering such service by the hourly rate
  applicable to such employee and other direct allocated expenses.&nbsp;
  <p>(b) Departmental Indirect Costs as defined in 2(c) (ii) will be loaded onto
  project codes in proportion to the direct salaries and wages charged to all
  project codes.
  <p>(c) Departmental Support Service Costs as defined in 2(c)(iii) will be
  allocated to other internal Services departments and the Client Companies
  using consumption-based billing methods, with these costs then distributed by
  function. Any costs that remain at Services after this initial billing will be
  loaded onto project codes in proportion to the direct salaries and wages
  charged to all project codes.&nbsp;
  <p>5. Those expenses of Services that are not included in the expenses of a
  department under Section 2 above will be charged to Client Companies receiving
  service as follows:&nbsp;
  <p>(a) Incremental out-of-pocket costs incurred for the direct benefit and
  convenience of a Client Company or a group of Client Companies will be charged
  directly to such company or group of companies.&nbsp;
  <p>(b) The Indirect Corporate Costs of Services referred to above in Section
  2(d)(ii) will be allocated among the Client Companies in the same proportion
  as the charges to the Client Companies, excluding Indirect Corporate Costs.&nbsp;
  <p>(c) If the method of allocation of Departmental Indirect Costs (Section
  4(b)), Departmental Support Service Costs (Section 4(c)), or Indirect
  Corporate Costs (Section 5(b)), would result in an inequity because of a
  change in operations or organization of the Client Companies, then Services
  may adjust the basis to effect an equitable distribution. Any such change in
  allocation shall be made only after first giving the Commission written notice
  of such proposed change not less than 60 days prior to the proposed
  effectiveness of any such change.&nbsp;
  <p>6. On the basis of the foregoing, monthly bills will be rendered to Client
  Company. Billing procedures and amounts will be open to audit by Client
  Company and by any regulatory authority having jurisdiction in respect of the
  Client Company.&nbsp;
  <p>7. When services are rendered to a group of Client Companies, costs of such
  service shall be allocated equitably among the Companies based on the nature
  and scope of the service rendered according to the formulae outlined in
  Exhibit II, Supplement.</font>
