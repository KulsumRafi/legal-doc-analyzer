attached hereto and, then, for only so long as Executive has not breached any provision of Section&nbsp;5 of this Agreement or any provision of that certain Proprietary Information and Inventions
Agreement, dated as of the date hereof, by and between Executive and the Company (the "Proprietary Rights Agreement"). Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all of Executive's rights to

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;For
purposes of this Agreement, "Cause" means (i)&nbsp;the commission by Executive of a felony or a crime involving moral turpitude or the commission by Executive of

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For
purposes of this Agreement, "Good Reason" means (i)&nbsp;a significant diminution by the Company of Executive's duties and responsibilities as compared to the
duties and responsibilities of Executive as of the date hereof, and/or (ii)&nbsp;a reduction by the Company of Executive's Base Salary to an amount below his initial Base Salary, unless such
reduction is made in connection with a company-wide reduction for budgetary purposes, and/or (iii)&nbsp;Executive is required, as a condition to continued employment with the Company, to
perform Executive's day-to-day duties and responsibilities to the Company at a location that would require Executive to relocate his residence outside of the Chicago

information, such as points-of-interest, traffic, weather, construction and other similar information, (ii)&nbsp;related database creation, access management, aggregation,
updating and/or distribution of software, (iii)&nbsp;vehicle navigation software and logical extensions thereof, and/or (iv)&nbsp;providing consulting and/or other services in the fields of map

as Executive has no active participation in the business of such corporation; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;during
the Noncompete Period, Executive shall not directly or indirectly through another person or entity (i)&nbsp;induce or attempt to induce any employee of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to leave the employ of the Company or such Subsidiary, or in any way interfere with the relationship between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any employee
thereof, (ii)&nbsp;hire any person who was an employee of the Company or any Subsidiary in a position above the level of Manager at any time during the Employment Period, and/or (iii)&nbsp;induce
or attempt to induce any customer, supplier, licensee, licensor, franchisee or other business relation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to cease doing business with the Company or such
Subsidiary, or in any way interfere with the relationship between any such customer, supplier, licensee or business relation and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (including, without limitation,
making any negative or disparaging statements or communications regarding the Company or any of its Subsidiaries); </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;if,
at the time of enforcement of this Section&nbsp;6, a court shall hold that the duration, scope or area restrictions stated herein are unreasonable under
circumstances then existing, the parties agree that the maximum duration, scope or area reasonable under such circumstances shall be substituted for the stated duration, scope or area and that the
court shall be allowed to revise the restrictions contained herein to cover the maximum period, scope and area permitted by law. Executive acknowledges that the restrictions contained in this
Section&nbsp;6 are reasonable and that he has reviewed the provisions of this Agreement with his legal counsel; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;in
the event of the breach or a threatened breach by Executive of any of the provisions of this Section&nbsp;6, the Company, in addition and supplementary to other
rights and remedies existing in its favor, shall be entitled to specific performance and/or injunctive or other equitable relief from a court of competent jurisdiction in order to enforce or prevent
any violation of the provisions hereof (without
posting a bond or other security). In addition, in the event of an alleged breach or violation by Executive of this Section&nbsp;6, the Noncompete Period shall be tolled until such breach or
violation has been duly cured; and </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;the
provisions of this Section&nbsp;6 are in consideration of: (i)&nbsp;employment with the Company, (ii)&nbsp;a grant to Executive of certain options to purchase
shares of the Company's common stock and (iii)&nbsp;additional good and valuable consideration as set forth in this Agreement. In addition, Executive agrees and acknowledges that the restrictions
contained in this Section&nbsp;6 and in the Proprietary Rights Agreement do not preclude Executive from earning a livelihood, nor do they unreasonably impose limitations on Executive's ability to
earn a living. In addition, Executive agrees and acknowledges that the potential harm to the Company and/or its affiliates of the non-enforcement of this Section&nbsp;6 and/or the
Proprietary Rights Agreement outweighs any potential harm to Executive of its enforcement by injunction or otherwise. In addition, Executive acknowledges that he has carefully read this Agreement and
has given careful consideration to the restraints imposed upon Executive by this Agreement and is in full accord as to their necessity for the reasonable and proper protection of confidential and
proprietary information of the Company now existing or to be developed in the future. Executive expressly acknowledges and agrees that each and every restraint imposed by this Agreement is reasonable
with respect to subject matter, time period and geographical area. </FONT></P>
