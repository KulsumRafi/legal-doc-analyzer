                                 AMENDMENT NO. 2
                                       TO
                          AT&T WIRELESS SERVICES, INC.
                          2001 LONG TERM INCENTIVE PLAN

Section 14(i) of the AT&T Wireless Services, Inc. 2001 Long Term Incentive Plan
(the "Plan") is hereby amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows:

            The Committee shall be authorized to establish procedures pursuant
            to which the payment of any Award may be deferred. Subject to the
            provisions of the Plan and any Award Agreement, the recipient of an
            Award (including, without limitation, any deferred Award) may, if so
            determined by the Committee, be entitled to receive, currently or on
            a deferred basis, cash dividends, or cash or Share payments in
            amounts equivalent to cash dividends on Shares ("dividend
            equivalents") with respect to the number of Shares covered by the
            Award, as determined by the Committee, in its sole discretion, and
            the Committee may provide that such amounts (if any) shall be deemed
            to have been reinvested in additional Shares or otherwise
            reinvested. Any amounts from such deferral program payable in Shares
            relating to Awards granted under the Plan or under the Company's
            Adjustment Plan shall be paid from Shares available for issuance
            under the Plan.
