<BR>

<BR>
<B>(iii)</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The exercise of the right of the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 4(c) shall not abrogate the rights or remedies of the Company in respect of the breach giving rise to such termination.<BR>
<BR>
<B>(iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>If the Company terminates the Executive's employment for Cause, he shall be entitled to:<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
<B>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Termination Without Cause</B></U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;If, during the Employment Period, the Company terminates the employment of the Executive hereunder for any reason other than a reason set forth in Section 4(a), 4(b) or 4(c):<BR>

<BR>
<B>(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>the Executive shall be entitled to any amounts owing but not yet paid pursuant to Section 3(e); <BR>

<BR>
<B>(C)&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>a diminution of the Executive's responsibilities and authority described in Section 2 resulting in responsibilities and authority in any material respect inconsistent with the responsibilities and authority of a senior officer of the Company, only after the Company shall have had an opportunity to cure (any such cure</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">5</P>
<P><HR></P>
<P>to be effected within 30 days after appropriate written notice of the basis for Good Reason is given to the Company by the Executive);<BR>
<BR>

In the event the Executive's employment with the Company is terminated by the Company without Cause or by the Executive for Good Reason, the foregoing non-competition covenant shall apply for two years following the date of the termination of the Executive's employment with the Company. The foregoing non-competition covenant shall not apply to the Executive in any given instance if the Board waives said covenant in writing with respect to that instance. Ownership by the Executive of less than one percent (1%) of the outstanding stock or securities in any business enterprise shall not itself be deemed to be engaging in any activity prohibited by </P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">6</P>
<P><HR></P>

<BR>
<B>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Assignment</B></U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The rights and benefits of the Executive hereunder shall not be assignable, whether by voluntary or involuntary assignment or transfer.

<BR>
<B>10.&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Notices</B></U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Any notice required or permitted to be given under this Agreement shall be sufficient if in writing and personally delivered, sent by certified or registered mail or sent by overnight courier service as follows: if to the Executive, to his address as set forth in the records of the Company, and if to the Company, to the address of its principal executive offices, attention: President, with a copy to Stanley Keller, Esquire, Palmer &amp; Dodge LLP, 111 Huntington Avenue at Prudential Center, Boston, MA 02199, or to any other address designated by any party hereto by notice similarly given.<BR>
<BR>
<B>11.&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Waiver of Breach</B></U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;A waiver by the Company or the Executive of any breach of any provision of this Agreement by the other party shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any other or subsequent breach by the other party.<BR>
<BR>
<B>12.&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Entire Agreement</B></U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;This Agreement contains the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.<A NAME="_DV_M10"><A NAME="_DV_M11"><A NAME="_DV_M12"><A NAME="_DV_M13"></A></A></A></A> This Agreement may be modified only by an agreement in writing signed by the parties hereto.<BR>
<BR>
<B>13.&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Severability</B></U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;In case any one or more of the provisions contained in this Agreement shall for any reason be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision of this Agreement, but this Agreement shall be construed as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had never been contained herein. If, moreover, any one or more of the provisions contained in this Agreement shall for any reason be held to be excessively broad as to time, duration, geographical scope, activity or subject, it shall be construed, by limiting and reducing it, so as to be enforceable to the extent compatible with the applicable law as it shall then appear.<BR>
<BR>
<B>14.&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Costs</B></U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event that a dispute shall arise between the parties hereto with respect to any term or provision of this Agreement or the subject matter hereof, all costs and expenses (including attorney fees incurred by the Company or the Executive associated with </P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">7</P>
<P><HR></P>
<P>such dispute) shall be borne by the respective party incurring such costs and expenses; <U>provided, however</U>, that if such dispute is ultimately determined in favor of Executive by a court of competent jurisdictions, then the Company shall be required to reimburse the Executive for up to an aggregate $100,000 of such costs and expenses actually incurred by the Executive in connection with such dispute.<BR>
<BR>
<B>15.&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Interpretation; Applicable Law</B></U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;This Agreement and its terms are subject to reasonable interpretation by the Compensation Committee in its sole discretion. The terms of this Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws (as opposed to the conflict of laws provisions) of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.<BR>
<BR>
<B>16.&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Complete Agreement</B></U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;This Agreement supersedes all other prior agreements between the Executive and the Company concerning the Executive's employment with the Company, and none of such agreements shall be of any force or effect whatsoever; provided, however, that nothing contained herein shall be deemed to limit or otherwise affect the provisions of any non-competition agreement or code of conduct arrangement between the Executive and the Company or the provisions of any other agreement, arrangement or policy concerning the Executive and the Company that is unrelated to the subject matter of this Agreement.<BR>
<BR>
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Agreement as of the day and year first above written.</P>
