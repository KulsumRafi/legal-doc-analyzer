     3.02     ELECTION PROCEDURES.

         (a) PARENT SHALL DESIGNATE AN EXCHANGE AGENT TO ACT AS AGENT (THE

OBLIGATIONS AS SPECIFIED HEREIN, THE EXCHANGE AGENT SHALL, NO LATER THAN FIVE
(5) BUSINESS DAYS AFTER THE EFFECTIVE DATE, MAIL OR MAKE AVAILABLE TO EACH
HOLDER OF RECORD OF A CERTIFICATE OR CERTIFICATES (i) A NOTICE AND LETTER OF
TRANSMITTAL (WHICH SHALL SPECIFY THAT DELIVERY SHALL BE EFFECTED, AND RISK OF

COMMONWEALTH BANK COMMON STOCK SHALL PASS, ONLY UPON PROPER DELIVERY OF THE
CERTIFICATES TO THE EXCHANGE AGENT) ADVISING SUCH HOLDER OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF

SECTION 3.01(b) HEREOF DELIVERABLE IN RESPECT THEREOF PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT
AND (II) AN ELECTION FORM IN SUCH FORM AS PARENT AND COMMONWEALTH BANK SHALL
MUTUALLY AGREE (THE "ELECTION FORM"). EACH ELECTION FORM SHALL PERMIT THE HOLDER
(OR IN THE CASE OF NOMINEE RECORD HOLDERS, THE BENEFICIAL OWNER THROUGH PROPER

COMMONWEALTH BANK COMMON STOCK ON BEHALF OF MULTIPLE BENEFICIAL OWNERS SHALL
INDICATE HOW MANY OF THE SHARES HELD BY THEM ARE STOCK ELECTION SHARES, CASH
ELECTION SHARES AND NO-ELECTION SHARES. IF A SHAREHOLDER EITHER (i) DOES NOT
SUBMIT A PROPERLY COMPLETED ELECTION FORM IN A TIMELY FASHION OR (II) REVOKES AN
ELECTION FORM PRIOR TO THE ELECTION DEADLINE AND DOES NOT RESUBMIT A PROPERLY
COMPLETED ELECTION FORM PRIOR TO THE ELECTION DEADLINE, THE SHARES OF
COMMONWEALTH BANK COMMON STOCK HELD BY SUCH SHAREHOLDER SHALL BE DESIGNATED
NO-ELECTION SHARES. ANY DISSENTING SHARES SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE CASH ELECTION
SHARES AND, WITH RESPECT TO SUCH SHARES, THE HOLDERS THEREOF SHALL IN NO EVENT
BE CLASSIFIED AS HOLDERS OF REALLOCATED STOCK SHARES.

         (b) THE TERM "ELECTION DEADLINE" SHALL MEAN 5:00 P.M., EASTERN TIME, ON

<PAGE>

         (c) ANY ELECTION TO RECEIVE PARENT COMMON STOCK OR CASH SHALL HAVE BEEN
PROPERLY MADE ONLY IF THE EXCHANGE AGENT SHALL HAVE ACTUALLY RECEIVED A PROPERLY
COMPLETED ELECTION FORM BY THE ELECTION DEADLINE. AN ELECTION FORM WILL BE
PROPERLY COMPLETED ONLY IF ACCOMPANIED BY CERTIFICATES REPRESENTING ALL SHARES
OF COMMONWEALTH BANK COMMON STOCK COVERED THEREBY, SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF
PARAGRAPH (c) OF SECTION 3.03. ANY ELECTION FORM MAY BE REVOKED OR CHANGED BY
THE PERSON SUBMITTING SUCH ELECTION FORM TO THE EXCHANGE AGENT BY WRITTEN NOTICE
TO THE EXCHANGE AGENT ONLY IF SUCH WRITTEN NOTICE IS ACTUALLY RECEIVED BY THE
EXCHANGE AGENT AT OR PRIOR TO THE ELECTION DEADLINE. THE CERTIFICATE OR
CERTIFICATES REPRESENTING COMMONWEALTH BANK COMMON STOCK RELATING TO ANY REVOKED
ELECTION FORM SHALL BE PROMPTLY RETURNED WITHOUT CHARGE TO THE PERSON SUBMITTING
THE ELECTION FORM TO THE EXCHANGE AGENT. THE EXCHANGE AGENT SHALL HAVE
REASONABLE DISCRETION TO DETERMINE WHEN ANY ELECTION, MODIFICATION OR REVOCATION
IS RECEIVED, WHETHER ANY SUCH ELECTION, MODIFICATION OR REVOCATION HAS BEEN
PROPERLY MADE AND TO DISREGARD IMMATERIAL DEFECTS IN ANY ELECTION FORM, AND ANY
GOOD FAITH DECISIONS OF THE EXCHANGE AGENT REGARDING SUCH MATTERS SHALL BE
BINDING AND CONCLUSIVE. NEITHER PARENT NOR THE EXCHANGE AGENT SHALL BE UNDER ANY
OBLIGATION TO NOTIFY ANY PERSON OF ANY DEFECT IN AN ELECTION FORM.

         (d) WITHIN TEN (10) BUSINESS DAYS AFTER THE ELECTION DEADLINE, THE
EXCHANGE AGENT SHALL EFFECT THE ALLOCATION AMONG HOLDERS OF COMMONWEALTH BANK
COMMON STOCK OF RIGHTS TO RECEIVE PARENT COMMON STOCK OR CASH IN THE MERGER IN
ACCORDANCE WITH THE ELECTION FORMS AS FOLLOWS:

                  (i) IF THE NUMBER OF CASH ELECTION SHARES TIMES THE PER SHARE
         CASH CONSIDERATION IS LESS THAN THE AGGREGATE CASH CONSIDERATION, THEN:

                           (1) ALL CASH ELECTION SHARES (SUBJECT TO SECTION 3.06
                  WITH RESPECT TO DISSENTING SHARES) SHALL BE CONVERTED INTO THE
                  RIGHT TO RECEIVE CASH,

                           (2) NO-ELECTION SHARES SHALL THEN BE DEEMED TO BE
                  CASH ELECTION SHARES TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO HAVE THE TOTAL
                  NUMBER OF CASH ELECTION SHARES TIMES THE PER SHARE CASH
                  CONSIDERATION EQUAL THE AGGREGATE CASH CONSIDERATION. IF LESS
                  THAN ALL OF THE NO-ELECTION SHARES NEED TO BE TREATED AS CASH
                  ELECTION SHARES, THEN THE EXCHANGE AGENT SHALL SELECT WHICH
                  NO-ELECTION SHARES SHALL BE TREATED AS CASH ELECTION SHARES IN
                  SUCH MANNER AS THE EXCHANGE AGENT SHALL DETERMINE, AND ALL
                  REMAINING NO-ELECTION SHARES SHALL THEREAFTER BE TREATED AS
                  STOCK ELECTION SHARES,

                           (3) IF ALL OF THE NO-ELECTION SHARES ARE TREATED AS
                  CASH ELECTION SHARES UNDER THE PRECEDING SUBSECTION AND THE
                  TOTAL NUMBER OF CASH ELECTION SHARES TIMES THE PER SHARE CASH
                  CONSIDERATION IS LESS THAN THE AGGREGATE CASH CONSIDERATION,
                  THEN THE EXCHANGE AGENT SHALL CONVERT ON A PRO RATA BASIS AS
                  DESCRIBED BELOW IN SECTION 3.02(e) A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF
                  STOCK ELECTION SHARES INTO CASH ELECTION SHARES ("REALLOCATED
                  CASH SHARES") SUCH THAT THE SUM OF THE NUMBER OF CASH ELECTION
                  SHARES PLUS THE NUMBER OF REALLOCATED CASH SHARES TIMES THE
                  PER SHARE CASH CONSIDERATION EQUALS THE


                                       11
<PAGE>

                  AGGREGATE CASH CONSIDERATION, AND ALL REALLOCATED CASH SHARES
                  WILL BE CONVERTED INTO THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE CASH, AND

                           (4) THE STOCK ELECTION SHARES WHICH ARE NOT
                  REALLOCATED CASH SHARES SHALL BE CONVERTED INTO THE RIGHT TO
                  RECEIVE PARENT COMMON STOCK.

                  (ii) IF THE NUMBER OF CASH ELECTION SHARES TIMES THE PER SHARE
         CASH CONSIDERATION IS GREATER THAN THE AGGREGATE CASH CONSIDERATION,
         THEN:

                           (1) ALL STOCK ELECTION SHARES AND ALL NO-ELECTION
                  SHARES SHALL BE CONVERTED INTO THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE PARENT
                  COMMON STOCK,

                           (2) THE EXCHANGE AGENT SHALL CONVERT ON A PRO RATA
                  BASIS AS DESCRIBED BELOW IN SECTION 3.02(e) A SUFFICIENT
                  NUMBER OF CASH ELECTION SHARES (EXCLUDING ANY DISSENTING
                  SHARES) ("REALLOCATED STOCK SHARES") SUCH THAT THE NUMBER OF
                  REMAINING CASH ELECTION SHARES (INCLUDING DISSENTING SHARES)
                  TIMES THE PER SHARE CASH CONSIDERATION EQUALS THE AGGREGATE
                  CASH CONSIDERATION, AND ALL REALLOCATED STOCK SHARES SHALL BE
                  CONVERTED INTO THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE PARENT COMMON STOCK, AND

                           (3) THE CASH ELECTION SHARES (SUBJECT TO SECTION 3.06
                  WITH RESPECT TO DISSENTING SHARES) WHICH ARE NOT REALLOCATED
                  STOCK SHARES SHALL BE CONVERTED INTO THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE
                  CASH.

                  (iii) IF THE NUMBER OF CASH ELECTION SHARES TIMES THE PER
         SHARE CASH CONSIDERATION IS EQUAL TO THE AGGREGATE CASH CONSIDERATION,
         THEN SUBPARAGRAPHS (d)(i) AND (II) ABOVE SHALL NOT APPLY AND ALL
         NO-ELECTION SHARES AND ALL STOCK ELECTION SHARES WILL BE CONVERTED INTO
         THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE PARENT COMMON STOCK.

         (e) IN THE EVENT THAT THE EXCHANGE AGENT IS REQUIRED PURSUANT TO
SECTION 3.02(d)(i)(3) TO CONVERT SOME STOCK ELECTION SHARES INTO REALLOCATED
CASH SHARES, EACH HOLDER OF STOCK ELECTION SHARES SHALL BE ALLOCATED A PRO RATA
PORTION OF THE TOTAL REALLOCATED CASH SHARES. IN THE EVENT THE EXCHANGE AGENT IS
REQUIRED PURSUANT TO SECTION 3.02(d)(II)(2) TO CONVERT SOME CASH ELECTION SHARES
INTO REALLOCATED STOCK SHARES, EACH HOLDER OF CASH ELECTION SHARES SHALL BE
ALLOCATED A PRO RATA PORTION OF THE TOTAL REALLOCATED STOCK SHARES.

         (f) IF AT THE TIME OF THE CLOSING, THE AGGREGATE VALUE OF THE SHARES OF
PARENT COMMON STOCK TO BE EXCHANGED FOR SHARES OF COMMONWEALTH BANK COMMON STOCK
IS LESS THAN FIFTY PERCENT (50%) OF THE AGGREGATE VALUE OF THE MERGER
CONSIDERATION, THEN PARENT SHALL DIRECT THE EXCHANGE AGENT TO CONVERT A MINIMUM
NUMBER OF NO-ELECTION SHARES AND, TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY A MINIMUM NUMBER OF
CASH ELECTION SHARES, INTO STOCK ELECTION SHARES SO THAT THE AGGREGATE VALUE OF
THE SHARES OF PARENT COMMON STOCK EXCHANGED FOR SHARES OF COMMONWEALTH BANK
COMMON STOCK (OTHER THAN CASH IN LIEU OF FRACTIONAL SHARES) CONSTITUTES FIFTY
PERCENT (50%) OF THE AGGREGATE VALUE OF THE MERGER CONSIDERATION. FOR PURPOSES
OF THIS SECTION 3.02(f) ONLY, THE VALUE OF A SHARE OF PARENT


                                       12
<PAGE>

COMMON STOCK WILL BE THE VALUE AS OF THE TIME OF THE CLOSING AS DETERMINED FOR
FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES.

      3.03     EXCHANGE PROCEDURES.

         (a) AT THE EFFECTIVE TIME, FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE HOLDERS OF
CERTIFICATES, (i) PARENT SHALL DELIVER TO THE EXCHANGE AGENT CERTIFICATES
EVIDENCING THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF PARENT COMMON STOCK ISSUABLE AND (II) PARENT
SHALL DELIVER, OR CAUSE FIRST COMMUNITY BANK TO DELIVER, TO THE EXCHANGE AGENT,
THE AGGREGATE CASH CONSIDERATION PAYABLE PURSUANT TO THIS ARTICLE III IN
EXCHANGE FOR CERTIFICATES REPRESENTING OUTSTANDING SHARES OF COMMONWEALTH BANK
COMMON STOCK. THE EXCHANGE AGENT SHALL NOT BE ENTITLED TO VOTE OR EXERCISE ANY
RIGHTS OF OWNERSHIP WITH RESPECT TO THE SHARES OF PARENT COMMON STOCK HELD BY IT
FROM TIME TO TIME HEREUNDER, EXCEPT THAT IT SHALL RECEIVE AND HOLD ALL DIVIDENDS
OR OTHER DISTRIBUTIONS PAID OR DISTRIBUTED WITH RESPECT TO SUCH SHARES FOR THE
ACCOUNT OF THE PERSONS ENTITLED THERETO.

         (b) AFTER COMPLETION OF THE ALLOCATION REFERRED TO IN PARAGRAPH (d) OF
SECTION 3.02, EACH HOLDER OF AN OUTSTANDING CERTIFICATE OR CERTIFICATES WHO HAS
SURRENDERED SUCH CERTIFICATE OR CERTIFICATES TO THE EXCHANGE AGENT WILL, UPON
ACCEPTANCE THEREOF BY THE EXCHANGE AGENT, BE ENTITLED TO A CERTIFICATE OR
CERTIFICATES REPRESENTING THE NUMBER OF WHOLE SHARES OF PARENT COMMON STOCK
AND/OR THE AMOUNT OF CASH INTO WHICH THE AGGREGATE NUMBER OF SHARES OF
COMMONWEALTH BANK COMMON STOCK PREVIOUSLY REPRESENTED BY SUCH CERTIFICATE OR
CERTIFICATES SURRENDERED SHALL HAVE BEEN CONVERTED PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT
AND, IF SUCH HOLDER'S SHARES OF COMMONWEALTH BANK COMMON STOCK HAVE BEEN
CONVERTED INTO PARENT COMMON STOCK, ANY OTHER DISTRIBUTION THERETOFORE PAID WITH
RESPECT TO PARENT COMMON STOCK ISSUABLE IN THE MERGER, IN EACH CASE WITHOUT
INTEREST. THE EXCHANGE AGENT SHALL ACCEPT SUCH CERTIFICATES UPON COMPLIANCE WITH
SUCH REASONABLE TERMS AND CONDITIONS AS THE EXCHANGE AGENT MAY IMPOSE TO EFFECT
AN ORDERLY EXCHANGE THEREOF IN ACCORDANCE WITH NORMAL EXCHANGE PRACTICES. EACH
OUTSTANDING CERTIFICATE WHICH PRIOR TO THE EFFECTIVE TIME REPRESENTED
COMMONWEALTH BANK COMMON STOCK AND WHICH IS NOT SURRENDERED TO THE EXCHANGE
AGENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROCEDURES PROVIDED FOR HEREIN SHALL, EXCEPT AS
OTHERWISE HEREIN PROVIDED, UNTIL DULY SURRENDERED TO THE EXCHANGE AGENT BE
DEEMED TO EVIDENCE OWNERSHIP OF THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF PARENT COMMON STOCK OR
THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE THE AMOUNT OF CASH INTO WHICH SUCH COMMONWEALTH BANK COMMON
STOCK SHALL HAVE BEEN CONVERTED. AFTER THE EFFECTIVE TIME, THERE SHALL BE NO
FURTHER TRANSFER ON THE RECORDS OF COMMONWEALTH BANK OF CERTIFICATES
REPRESENTING SHARES OF COMMONWEALTH BANK COMMON STOCK AND IF SUCH CERTIFICATES
ARE PRESENTED TO COMMONWEALTH BANK FOR TRANSFER, THEY SHALL BE CANCELLED AGAINST
DELIVERY OF CERTIFICATES FOR PARENT COMMON STOCK OR CASH AS HEREINABOVE
PROVIDED. NO DIVIDENDS WHICH HAVE BEEN DECLARED WILL BE REMITTED TO ANY PERSON
ENTITLED TO RECEIVE SHARES OF PARENT COMMON STOCK UNDER SECTION 3.02 UNTIL SUCH
PERSON SURRENDERS THE CERTIFICATE OR CERTIFICATES REPRESENTING COMMONWEALTH BANK
COMMON STOCK, AT WHICH TIME SUCH DIVIDENDS SHALL BE REMITTED TO SUCH PERSON,
WITHOUT INTEREST.

         (c) THE EXCHANGE AGENT AND PARENT, AS THE CASE MAY BE, SHALL NOT BE
OBLIGATED TO DELIVER CASH AND/OR A CERTIFICATE OR CERTIFICATES REPRESENTING
SHARES OF PARENT COMMON STOCK TO WHICH A HOLDER OF COMMONWEALTH BANK COMMON
STOCK WOULD


                                       13
<PAGE>

OTHERWISE BE ENTITLED AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER UNTIL SUCH HOLDER SURRENDERS THE
CERTIFICATE OR CERTIFICATES REPRESENTING THE SHARES OF COMMONWEALTH BANK COMMON
STOCK FOR EXCHANGE AS PROVIDED IN THIS SECTION 3.03, OR, IN DEFAULT THEREOF, AN
APPROPRIATE AFFIDAVIT OF LOSS AND INDEMNITY AGREEMENT AND/OR A BOND IN AN AMOUNT
AS MAY BE REASONABLY REQUIRED IN EACH CASE BY PARENT. IF ANY CERTIFICATES
EVIDENCING SHARES OF PARENT COMMON STOCK ARE TO BE ISSUED IN A NAME OTHER THAN
THAT IN WHICH THE CERTIFICATE EVIDENCING COMMONWEALTH BANK COMMON STOCK
SURRENDERED IN EXCHANGE THEREFORE IS REGISTERED, IT SHALL BE A CONDITION OF THE
ISSUANCE THEREOF THAT THE CERTIFICATE SO SURRENDERED SHALL BE PROPERLY ENDORSED
OR ACCOMPANIED BY AN EXECUTED FORM OF ASSIGNMENT SEPARATE FROM THE CERTIFICATE
AND OTHERWISE IN PROPER FORM FOR TRANSFER AND THAT THE PERSON REQUESTING SUCH
EXCHANGE PAY TO THE EXCHANGE AGENT ANY TRANSFER OR OTHER TAX REQUIRED BY REASON
OF THE ISSUANCE OF A CERTIFICATE FOR SHARES OF PARENT COMMON STOCK IN ANY NAME
OTHER THAN THAT OF THE REGISTERED HOLDER OF THE CERTIFICATE SURRENDERED OR
OTHERWISE ESTABLISH TO THE SATISFACTION OF THE EXCHANGE AGENT THAT SUCH TAX HAS
BEEN PAID OR IS NOT PAYABLE.

         (d) ANY PORTION OF THE SHARES OF PARENT COMMON STOCK AND CASH DELIVERED
TO THE EXCHANGE AGENT BY PARENT PURSUANT TO SECTION 3.03(a) THAT REMAINS
UNCLAIMED BY THE STOCKHOLDERS OF COMMONWEALTH BANK FOR SIX MONTHS AFTER THE
EFFECTIVE TIME (AS WELL AS ANY PROCEEDS FROM ANY INVESTMENT THEREOF) SHALL BE
DELIVERED BY THE EXCHANGE AGENT TO PARENT. ANY STOCKHOLDERS OF COMMONWEALTH BANK
WHO HAVE NOT THERETOFORE COMPLIED WITH SECTION 3.03(b) SHALL THEREAFTER LOOK
ONLY TO PARENT FOR THE CONSIDERATION DELIVERABLE IN RESPECT OF EACH SHARE OF
COMMONWEALTH BANK COMMON STOCK SUCH SHAREHOLDER HOLDS AS DETERMINED PURSUANT TO
THIS AGREEMENT WITHOUT ANY INTEREST THEREON. IF OUTSTANDING CERTIFICATES FOR
SHARES OF COMMONWEALTH BANK COMMON STOCK ARE NOT SURRENDERED OR THE PAYMENT FOR
THEM IS NOT CLAIMED PRIOR TO THE DATE ON WHICH SUCH SHARES OF PARENT COMMON
STOCK OR CASH WOULD OTHERWISE ESCHEAT TO OR BECOME THE PROPERTY OF ANY
GOVERNMENTAL UNIT OR AGENCY, THE UNCLAIMED ITEMS SHALL, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED
BY ABANDONED PROPERTY AND ANY OTHER APPLICABLE LAW, BECOME THE PROPERTY OF
PARENT (AND TO THE EXTENT NOT IN ITS POSSESSION SHALL BE DELIVERED TO IT), FREE
AND CLEAR OF ALL CLAIMS OR INTEREST OF ANY PERSON PREVIOUSLY ENTITLED TO SUCH
PROPERTY. NEITHER THE EXCHANGE AGENT NOR ANY PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE
LIABLE TO ANY HOLDER OF STOCK REPRESENTED BY ANY CERTIFICATE FOR ANY
CONSIDERATION PAID TO A PUBLIC OFFICIAL PURSUANT TO APPLICABLE ABANDONED
PROPERTY, ESCHEAT OR SIMILAR LAWS. PARENT AND THE EXCHANGE AGENT SHALL BE
ENTITLED TO RELY UPON THE STOCK TRANSFER BOOKS OF COMMONWEALTH BANK TO ESTABLISH
THE IDENTITY OF THOSE PERSONS ENTITLED TO RECEIVE THE CONSIDERATION SPECIFIED IN
THIS AGREEMENT, WHICH BOOKS SHALL BE CONCLUSIVE WITH RESPECT THERETO. IN THE
EVENT OF A DISPUTE WITH RESPECT TO OWNERSHIP OF STOCK REPRESENTED BY ANY
CERTIFICATE, PARENT AND THE EXCHANGE AGENT SHALL BE ENTITLED TO DEPOSIT ANY
CONSIDERATION REPRESENTED THEREBY IN ESCROW WITH AN INDEPENDENT THIRD PARTY AND
THEREAFTER BE RELIEVED WITH RESPECT TO ANY CLAIMS THERETO.

         (e) NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING IN THIS AGREEMENT TO THE CONTRARY,
CERTIFICATES SURRENDERED FOR EXCHANGE BY ANY COMMONWEALTH BANK AFFILIATE SHALL
NOT BE EXCHANGED FOR CERTIFICATES REPRESENTING SHARES OF PARENT COMMON STOCK TO
WHICH SUCH COMMONWEALTH BANK AFFILIATE MAY BE ENTITLED PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF
THIS AGREEMENT UNTIL PARENT HAS RECEIVED A WRITTEN AGREEMENT FROM SUCH PERSON AS
SPECIFIED IN SECTION 6.07.

STOCK WHO OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE BEEN ENTITLED TO A FRACTION OF A SHARE OF PARENT
COMMON STOCK (AFTER TAKING INTO ACCOUNT ALL CERTIFICATES DELIVERED BY SUCH
HOLDER) SHALL RECEIVE IN LIEU THEREOF CASH (WITHOUT INTEREST) IN AN AMOUNT
DETERMINED BY MULTIPLYING THE FRACTIONAL SHARE INTEREST TO WHICH SUCH HOLDER
WOULD OTHERWISE BE ENTITLED BY THE AVERAGE SHARE PRICE OF THE PARENT COMMON
STOCK, ROUNDED TO THE NEAREST WHOLE CENT. NO SUCH HOLDER SHALL BE ENTITLED TO
DIVIDENDS, VOTING RIGHTS OR ANY OTHER RIGHTS IN RESPECT OF ANY FRACTIONAL SHARE.

         PLAN THAT, ASSUMING THE TAXABLE PERIOD OF SUCH TRANSACTION EXPIRED AS

         THE SINGLE-EMPLOYER PLAN OF ANY ENTITY WHICH IS CONSIDERED ONE EMPLOYER

         THE CODE (AN "ERISA AFFILIATE"). COMMONWEALTH BANK HAS NOT INCURRED,
         AND DOES NOT EXPECT TO INCUR, ANY WITHDRAWAL LIABILITY WITH RESPECT TO
         A MULTIEMPLOYER PLAN UNDER SUBTITLE E OF TITLE IV OF ERISA (REGARDLESS
         OF WHETHER BASED ON CONTRIBUTIONS OF AN ERISA AFFILIATE). NO NOTICE OF
         A "REPORTABLE EVENT," WITHIN THE MEANING OF SECTION 4043 OF ERISA FOR
         WHICH THE 30-DAY REPORTING REQUIREMENT HAS NOT BEEN WAIVED, HAS BEEN
         REQUIRED TO BE FILED FOR ANY PENSION PLAN OR BY ANY ERISA AFFILIATE

         ANY BENEFIT PLAN HAVE BEEN TIMELY MADE OR HAVE BEEN REFLECTED ON THE
         FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF COMMONWEALTH BANK INCLUDED IN COMMONWEALTH
         BANK'S SECURITIES DOCUMENTS. NEITHER ANY PENSION PLAN NOR ANY
         SINGLE-EMPLOYER PLAN OF AN ERISA AFFILIATE HAS AN "ACCUMULATED FUNDING
         DEFICIENCY" (WHETHER OR NOT WAIVED) WITHIN THE MEANING OF SECTION 412
         OF THE CODE OR SECTION 302 OF ERISA AND NO ERISA AFFILIATE HAS AN
         OUTSTANDING FUNDING WAIVER. COMMONWEALTH BANK HAS NOT PROVIDED, AND IS
         NOT REQUIRED TO PROVIDE, SECURITY TO ANY PENSION PLAN OR TO ANY
         SINGLE-EMPLOYER PLAN OF AN ERISA AFFILIATE PURSUANT TO SECTION
         401(a)(29) OF THE CODE.

                  (v) COMMONWEALTH BANK HAS NO OBLIGATIONS FOR RETIREE HEALTH

         OR UNDER THE CONTINUATION OF COVERAGE PROVISIONS OF THE LAWS OF ANY
         STATE OR LOCALITY. COMMONWEALTH BANK MAY AMEND OR TERMINATE ANY SUCH
         BENEFIT PLAN AT ANY TIME WITHOUT INCURRING ANY LIABILITY THEREUNDER. NO
         EVENT OR CONDITION EXISTS WITH RESPECT TO A BENEFIT PLAN THAT COULD
         SUBJECT COMMONWEALTH BANK TO A MATERIAL TAX UNDER SECTION 4980B OF THE
         CODE.

                  (vi) NONE OF THE EXECUTION OF THIS AGREEMENT, SHAREHOLDER
         APPROVAL OF THIS AGREEMENT OR CONSUMMATION OF THE TRANSACTION WILL (A)
         EXCEPT AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, ENTITLE ANY EMPLOYEES OF COMMONWEALTH
         BANK TO SEVERANCE PAY OR ANY INCREASE IN SEVERANCE PAY UPON ANY
         TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT AFTER THE DATE HEREOF, (B) ACCELERATE THE
         TIME OF PAYMENT OR VESTING OR TRIGGER ANY PAYMENT OR FUNDING (THROUGH A
         GRANTOR TRUST OR OTHERWISE) OF COMPENSATION OR BENEFITS UNDER, INCREASE
         THE AMOUNT PAYABLE OR TRIGGER ANY OTHER MATERIAL OBLIGATION PURSUANT
         TO, ANY OF THE BENEFIT PLANS, (C) RESULT IN ANY BREACH OR VIOLATION OF,
         OR A DEFAULT UNDER, ANY OF THE BENEFIT PLANS OR (D) RESULT IN ANY
         PAYMENT THAT WOULD BE A "PARACHUTE PAYMENT" TO A "DISQUALIFIED
         INDIVIDUAL" AS THOSE TERMS ARE DEFINED IN SECTION 280G OF THE CODE,
         WITHOUT REGARD TO WHETHER SUCH PAYMENT IS REASONABLE COMPENSATION FOR
         PERSONAL SERVICES PERFORMED OR TO BE PERFORMED IN THE FUTURE.

         LIMITED TO FORM 5500 ANNUAL REPORTS AND REQUIRED ATTACHMENTS, FORMS

                              SHAREHOLDER AGREEMENT

                  SHAREHOLDER AGREEMENT (the "Agreement"), dated as of January
27, 2003, among __________________, a shareholder ("Shareholder") of The
CommonWealth Bank, a Virginia-chartered commercial bank ("CommonWealth Bank "),
First Community Bank, N.A., a national bank ("First Community Bank"), and First
Community Bancshares, Inc., a Nevada corporation ("Parent"). All terms used
herein and not defined herein shall have the meanings assigned thereto in the
Merger Agreement (defined below).

                  WHEREAS, Parent, First Community Bank and CommonWealth Bank
are entering into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of the date hereof
(the "Merger Agreement"), pursuant to which CommonWealth Bank will merge with
and into First Community Bank on the terms and conditions set forth therein (the
"Merger") and, in connection therewith, outstanding shares of CommonWealth Bank
Common Stock will be converted into shares of Parent Common Stock and/or cash in
the manner set forth therein; and

                  WHEREAS, Shareholder owns the shares of CommonWealth Bank
Common Stock identified on Exhibit I hereto (such shares, together with all
shares of CommonWealth Bank Common Stock subsequently acquired by Shareholder
during the term of this Agreement, being referred to as the "Shares"); and

                  WHEREAS, in order to induce Parent and First Community Bank to
enter into the Merger Agreement, Shareholder, solely in such Shareholder's
capacity as a shareholder of CommonWealth Bank and not in any other capacity,
has agreed to enter into and perform this Agreement.

                  NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the
receipt, sufficiency and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties
hereto agree as follows:

         1. Agreement to Vote Shares. Shareholder agrees that at any meeting of
the stockholders of CommonWealth Bank, or in connection with any written consent
of the stockholders of CommonWealth Bank, Shareholder shall:

                  (i) appear at each such meeting or otherwise cause the Shares
to be counted as present thereat for purposes of calculating a quorum; and

                  (ii) vote (or cause to be voted), in person or by proxy, or
deliver a written consent (or cause a consent to be delivered) covering, all the
Shares (whether acquired heretofore or hereafter) that are beneficially owned by
Shareholder or as to which Shareholder has, directly or indirectly, the right to
vote or direct the voting, (x) in favor of adoption and approval of the Merger
Agreement and the Merger; (y) against any action or agreement that would result
in a breach of any covenant, representation or warranty or any other obligation
or agreement of CommonWealth Bank contained in the Merger Agreement or of
Shareholder contained in this Agreement; and (z) against any Acquisition
Proposal or any other action, agreement or transaction that is intended, or
could reasonably be expected, to materially impede, interfere or


                                      A-1
<PAGE>

be inconsistent with, delay, postpone, discourage or materially and adversely
affect consummation of the Merger or this Agreement.

         2. No Transfers. Prior to the CommonWealth Bank Meeting, Shareholder
agrees not to, directly or indirectly, sell transfer, pledge, assign or
otherwise dispose of, or enter into any contract option, commitment or other
arrangement or understanding with respect to the sale, transfer, pledge,
assignment or other disposition of, any of the Shares. In the case of any
transfer by operation of law, this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to
the transferee(s). Any transfer or other disposition in violation of the terms
of this Section 2 shall be null and void.

         3. Representations and Warranties of Shareholder. Shareholder
represents and warrants to and agrees with Parent and First Community Bank as
follows:

                  A. Capacity. Shareholder has all requisite capacity and
authority to enter into and perform his, her or its obligations under this
Agreement.

                  B. Binding Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the valid and
legally binding obligation of Shareholder, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general
applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to general equity
principles.

                  C. Non-Contravention. The execution and delivery of this
Agreement by Shareholder does not, and the performance by Shareholder of his,
her or its obligations hereunder and the consummation by Shareholder of the
transactions contemplated hereby will not, violate or conflict with, or
constitute a default under, any agreement, instrument, contract or other
obligation or any order, arbitration award, judgment or decree to which
Shareholder is a party or by which Shareholder is bound, or any statute, rule or
regulation to which Shareholder is subject or, in the event that Shareholder is
a corporation, partnership, trust or other entity, any charter, bylaw or other
organizational document of Shareholder.

                  D. Ownership of Shares. Shareholder has good title to all of
the Shares as of the date hereof, and, except as set forth on Exhibit I hereto,
the Shares are so owned free and clear of any liens, security interests, charges
or other encumbrances.

         4. Specific Performance and Remedies. Shareholder acknowledges that it
will be impossible to measure in money the damage to Parent and First Community
Bank if Shareholder fails to comply with the obligations imposed by this
Agreement and that, in the event of any such failure, Parent and First Community
Bank will not have an adequate remedy at law or in equity. Accordingly,
Shareholder agrees that injunctive relief or other equitable remedy, in addition
to remedies at law or in damages, is the appropriate remedy for any such failure
and will not oppose the granting of such relief on the basis that Parent and
First Community Bank may have an adequate remedy at law. Shareholder agrees that
Shareholder will not seek, and agrees to waive any requirement for, the securing
or posting of a bond in connection with Parent's or First Community Bank's
seeking or obtaining such equitable relief. In addition, after discussing the
matter with Shareholder, Parent and First Community Bank shall have the right to
inform any third party that Parent and First Community Bank reasonably believe
to be, or to be contemplating, participating with Shareholder or receiving from
Shareholder assistance in


                                      A-2
<PAGE>

violation of this Agreement, of the terms of this Agreement and of the rights of
Parent and First Community Bank hereunder, and that participation by any such
persons with Shareholder in activities in violation of Shareholder's agreement
with Parent and First Community Bank set forth in this Agreement may give rise
to claims by Parent and First Community Bank against such third party.

         5. Term of Agreement; Termination.

                  A. The term of this Agreement shall commence on the date
hereof.

                  B. This Agreement shall terminate upon the date, if any, of
termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms. Upon such
termination, no party shall have any further obligations or liabilities
hereunder; provided, however, such termination shall not relieve any party from
liability for any willful breach of this Agreement prior to such termination.

                  C. If the Merger Agreement is not terminated in accordance
with its terms, this Agreement (except for the provisions of Sections 3 and 8,
which shall survive the Effective Time) shall terminate upon the Effective Time.
Upon such termination, no party shall have any further obligations or
liabilities under this Agreement; provided, however, such termination shall not
relieve any party from liability for any willful breach of such Section prior to
such termination.

         6. Entire Agreement. This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements,
written or oral, among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter
hereof and contains the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof. This Agreement may not be amended, supplemented or
modified, and no provisions hereof may be modified or waived, except by an
instrument in writing signed by each party hereto. No waiver of any provisions
hereof by any party shall be deemed a waiver of any other provisions hereof by
any such party, nor shall any such waiver be deemed a continuing waiver of any
provision hereof by such party.

         7. Notices. All notices, requests, claims, demands or other
communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed given when
delivered personally, upon receipt of a transmission confirmation if sent by
telecopy or like transmission and on the next business day when sent by a
reputable overnight courier service to the parties at the following addresses
(or at such other address for a party as shall be specified by like notice):

                                 _________, 2003


First Community Bancshares, Inc.
One Community Place
Bluefield, Virginia   24605

Ladies and Gentlemen:

I have been advised that I may be deemed to be, but do not admit that I am, an
"affiliate" of The CommonWealth Bank, a Virginia-chartered commercial bank
("CommonWealth Bank"), as that term is defined in Rule 144 and used in Rule 145
promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"). I understand that
pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of January
27, 2003 (the "Agreement"), among First Community Bancshares, Inc., a Nevada
corporation ("Parent"), First Community Bank, National Association, a national
bank ("First Community Bank"), and CommonWealth Bank, CommonWealth Bank plans to
merge with and into First Community Bank (the "Merger").

I further understand that as a result of the Merger, I may receive shares of
common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of Parent ("Parent Common Stock") in
exchange for shares of common stock, par value $4.00 per share, of CommonWealth
Bank ("CommonWealth Bank Common Stock").

I have carefully read this letter and reviewed the Agreement and discussed their
requirements and other applicable limitations upon my ability to sell, transfer,
or otherwise dispose of Parent Common Stock, to the extent I felt necessary,
with my counsel or counsel for CommonWealth Bank.

I represent, warrant and covenant with and to Parent that in the event I receive
any shares of Parent Common Stock as a result of the Merger:

1. I shall not make any sale, transfer, or other disposition of such shares of
Parent Common Stock unless (i) such sale, transfer or other disposition has been
registered under the Securities Act, (ii) such sale, transfer or other
disposition is made in conformity with the provisions of Rule 145 under the
Securities Act (as such rule may be amended from time to time), or (iii) in the
opinion of counsel in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent, or
under a "no-action" letter obtained by me from the staff of the SEC, such sale,
transfer or

<PAGE>

other disposition will not violate the registration requirements of, or is
otherwise exempt from registration under, the Securities Act.

         2. I understand that Parent is under no obligation to register the
sale, transfer or other disposition of shares of Parent Common Stock by me or on
my behalf under the Securities Act or to take any other action necessary in
order to make compliance with an exemption from such registration available.

         3. I understand that stop transfer instructions will be given to
Parent's transfer agent with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock issued to
me as a result of the Merger and that there will be placed on the certificates
for such shares, or any substitutions therefor, a legend stating in substance:

"THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE WERE ISSUED AS A RESULT OF THE
                                    MERGER OF THE COMMONWEALTH BANK WITH AND

         4. I understand that, unless transfer by me of the Parent Common Stock
issued to me as a result of the Merger has been registered under the Securities
Act or such transfer is made in conformity with the provisions of Rule 145(d)
under the Securities Act, Parent reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to
place the following legend on the certificates issued to my transferee:

"THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE

                                    APPLIES. THE SHARES HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED BY
                                    THE HOLDER NOT WITH A VIEW TO, OR FOR RESALE
                                    IN CONNECTION WITH, ANY DISTRIBUTION THEREOF
                                    WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF
                                    1933 AND MAY NOT BE OFFERED, SOLD, PLEDGED
                                    OR OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED EXCEPT IN
                                    ACCORDANCE WITH AN EXEMPTION FROM THE
                                    REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE SECURITIES
                                    ACT OF 1933."

It is understood and agreed that the legends set forth in paragraphs (3) and (4)
above shall be removed by delivery of substitute certificates without such
legends if I shall have delivered to Parent (i) a copy of a "no action" letter
from the staff of the SEC, or an opinion of counsel in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Parent, to the effect that such legend is not
required for purposes of the Securities Act, or (ii) evidence or representations
satisfactory to Parent that Parent Common Stock represented by such certificates
is being or has been sold in conformity with the provisions of Rule 145(d). I
further understand and agree that the provisions of Rule 145 shall apply to all
shares of Parent Common Stock that my spouse, any relative of mine, or any
relative of my spouse, any one of whom has the same home as me, receives as a
result of the Merger and I further represent, warrant and covenant with and to
Parent that I will have, and will cause each of such persons to have, all shares
of CommonWealth Bank Common Stock owned (other than shares held through tax
qualified retirement or benefit plans) by me or such persons registered in my
name or the name of such persons, as applicable, prior to the effective date of
the Merger and not in the name of any bank, broker or dealer, nominee or
clearing house.

By acceptance hereof, Parent agrees, for a period of two years after the
Effective Time (as defined in the Agreement) that, so long as it is obligated to
file reports pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended, it will use its reasonable best efforts to timely file such
reports so that the public information requirements of Rule 144(c) promulgated
under the Securities Act are satisfied and the resale provisions of Rule
145(d)(1) and (2) are therefore available to me in the event I desire to
transfer any Parent Common Stock issued to me in the Merger.



                                                     Very truly yours,

terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. The term of employment under
this Agreement shall be for a term of two years, commencing on the date of this
Agreement, unless such term is extended as provided in this Section 3. Prior to
the second annual anniversary of the date first above written and each annual
anniversary thereafter, the Board of Directors of the Bank shall consider,
review (with appropriate corporate documentation thereof, and after taking into
account all relevant factors, including the Executive's performance) and, if
appropriate, explicitly approve a one-year extension of the remaining term of
this Agreement. After the expiration of the initial two-year term, the term of
this Agreement shall continue to extend each year if the Board of Directors so
approves such extension, unless the Executive gives written notice to the Bank
of the Executive's election not to extend the term, with such notice to be given
not less than sixty (60) days prior to any such anniversary date. If the Board
of Directors elects not to extend the term, it shall give written notice of such
decision to the Executive not less than sixty (60) days prior to any such
anniversary date. If any party gives timely notice that the term will not be
extended, then this Agreement shall terminate at the conclusion of its remaining
term. References herein to the term of this Agreement shall refer both to the
initial term and successive terms.

         (b) During the term of this Agreement, the Executive shall perform such
executive services for the Bank as may be consistent with his titles and from
time to time assigned to him by the Bank's Board of Directors.

         (c) In the event of a Change in Control, the term of this Agreement
shall automatically be extended for a term of two years beginning on the
effective date of the Change in Control. After the expiration of the two-year
term, the term of this Agreement may be renewed for successive one-year terms as
provided in paragraph (a) above.

    4. COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS.

         (a) The Bank shall compensate and pay the Executive for his services
during the term of this Agreement at a minimum base salary of $150,000 per year
("Base Salary"), which may be increased from time to time in such amounts as may
be determined by the Board of Directors of the Bank and may not be decreased
without the Executive's express written consent. In addition to his Base Salary,
the Executive shall be entitled to receive during the term of this Agreement
such bonus payments as may be determined by the Board of Directors of the Bank
solely in its discretion.

         (b) During the term of this Agreement, the Executive shall be entitled
to participate in and receive the benefits of any pension or other retirement
benefit plan, profit sharing, stock option, employee stock ownership, or other
plans, benefits and privileges given to employees and executives of the
Corporation, to the extent commensurate with his then duties and
responsibilities as fixed by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.

         (c) During the term of this Agreement, the Executive shall be entitled
to take six (6) weeks of paid annual vacation in accordance with the Bank's
established policies. The Executive shall not be entitled to receive any
additional compensation from the Bank for failure


                                      C-4
<PAGE>

to take a vacation, nor shall the Executive be able to accumulate unused
vacation time from one year to the next, except to the extent authorized by the
Board of Directors of the Bank.

         (d) In the event the Executive's employment is terminated due to
Disability, the Bank shall provide continued life, medical, dental and
disability in an amount and to the extent consistent with the Bank's established
policies.

    5.EXPENSES. The Bank shall reimburse the Executive or otherwise provide
for or pay for all reasonable expenses incurred by the Executive in furtherance
of or in connection with the business of the Bank, including, but not by way of
limitation, traveling expenses, subject to such reasonable documentation and
other limitations as may be established by the Board of Directors of the Bank.
If such expenses are paid in the first instance by the Executive, the Bank shall
reimburse the Executive therefor.

    6. TERMINATION.

         (a) The Bank shall have the right, at any time upon prior Notice of
Termination, to terminate the Executive's employment hereunder for any reason,
including, without limitation, termination for Cause or Disability, and the
Executive shall have the right, upon prior Notice of Termination, to terminate
his employment hereunder for any reason.

         (b) In the event that (i) the Executive's employment is terminated by
the Bank for Cause, (ii) the Executive dies or (iii) the Executive terminates
his employment hereunder other than for Disability or Good Reason, the Executive
shall have no right pursuant to this Agreement to compensation or other benefits
for any period after the applicable Date of Termination or death other than for
Base Salary accrued through the Date of Termination or death.

         (c) In the event that the Executive's employment is terminated as a
result of Disability during the term of this Agreement, the Executive shall
receive his salary for a period of ninety (90) days from the Date of
Termination.

         (d) In the event that (i) the Executive's employment is terminated by
the Bank for other than Cause, Disability, or the Executive's death or (ii) such
employment is terminated by the Executive (a) due to a material breach of this
Agreement by the Bank, which breach has not been cured within fifteen (15) days
after a written notice of non-compliance has been given by the Executive to the
Bank, or (b) for Good Reason, then the Bank shall, subject to Section 6 hereof,
if applicable:

                  (A) pay to the Executive, a cash severance amount equal to the
         Executive's Base Salary as in effect immediately prior to the Date of
         Termination, multiplied by two years ("Severance Pay"). Such Severance
         Pay shall be paid in monthly installments beginning with the first
         business day of the month following the Date of Termination and
         continuing for two (2) years; and

                  (B) maintain and provide for a period ending at the earlier of
         (i) the second anniversary of the Date of Termination or (ii) the date
         of the Executive's full-time employment by another employer, at no cost
         to the Executive, the Executive's continued


                                      C-5
<PAGE>

         participation in all group insurance, life insurance, health and
         accident, disability and other employee benefit plans, programs and
         arrangements in which the Executive was entitled to participate
         immediately prior to the Date of Termination (other than any stock
         option or other stock compensation plans or bonus plans of the
         Corporation), provided that in the event that Executive's participation
         in any such plan, program or arrangement is barred, the Bank shall
         arrange to provide Executive with benefits substantially similar to
         those Executive was entitled to receive under such plans, programs and
         arrangements prior to the Date of Termination.

         (e) In receiving any payments pursuant to this Section 6, the Executive
shall not be obligated to seek other employment or take any other action by way
of mitigation of the amounts payable to the Executive hereunder, and such
amounts shall not be reduced or terminated whether or not the Executive obtains
other employment.

    7.  LIMITATION OF BENEFITS UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES. If the payments
and benefits pursuant to Section 6 hereof, either alone or together with other
payments and benefits which the Executive has the right to receive from the
Bank, would constitute a "parachute payment" under Section 280G of the Code, the
payments and benefits payable by the Bank pursuant to Section 6 hereof shall be
reduced, in the manner determined by the Executive, by the amount, if any, which
is the minimum necessary to result in no portion of the payments and benefits
payable by the Bank under Section 6 being non-deductible to the Bank pursuant to
Section 280G of the Code and subject to the excise tax imposed under Section
4999 of the Code. The determination of any reduction in the payments and
benefits to be made pursuant to Section 6 shall be based upon the opinion of
independent counsel selected by the Bank's independent public accountants and
paid by the Bank. Such counsel shall be reasonably acceptable to the Bank and
the Executive; shall promptly prepare the foregoing opinion, but in no event
later than thirty (30) days from the Date of Termination; and may use such
actuaries as such counsel deems necessary or advisable for the purpose. Nothing
contained herein shall result in a reduction of any payments or benefits to
which the Executive may be entitled upon termination of employment under any
circumstances other than as specified in this Section 7, or a reduction in the
payments and benefits specified in Section 6 below zero.

    8. RESTRICTIONS RESPECTING COMPETING BUSINESSES, CONFIDENTIAL
INFORMATION, ETC.

         (a) The Executive acknowledges and agrees that by virtue of the
Executive's position and involvement with the business and affairs of the Bank,
the Executive will develop substantial expertise and knowledge with respect to
all aspects of the Banks' business, affairs and operations and will have access
to all significant aspects of the business and operations of the Bank and to
Confidential and Proprietary Information.

         (b) The Executive hereby covenants and agrees that, during the term of
employment and thereafter, unless otherwise authorized by the Bank in writing,
the Executive shall not, directly or indirectly, under any circumstance: (i)
disclose to any other person or entity (other than in the regular course of
business of the Bank) any Confidential and Proprietary Information, other than
pursuant to applicable law, regulation or subpoena or with the prior written
consent of the Bank; (ii) act or fail to act so as to impair the confidential or
proprietary


                                      C-6
<PAGE>

nature of any Confidential and Proprietary Information; (iii) use any
Confidential and Proprietary Information other than for the sole and exclusive
benefit of the Bank; or (iv) offer or agree to, or cause or assist in the
inception or continuation of, any such disclosure, impairment or use of any
Confidential and Proprietary Information. Following the term of employment, the
Executive shall return all documents, records and other items containing any
Confidential and Proprietary Information to the Bank (regardless of the medium
in which maintained or stored).

         (c) The Executive covenants and agrees that while the Executive is
employed by the Bank and for one (1) year after the Executive ceases to be
employed by the Bank for any reason, other than the termination of his
employment after the Bank has elected not to renew this Agreement as provided in
Section 3(a), the Executive shall not, directly or indirectly, manage, operate
or control, any Competing Business or, directly or indirectly, induce or
influence any customer or other Person that has a business relationship with the
Bank, or any Affiliate of the Bank, to discontinue or reduce the extent of such
relationship; provided that in the case of a termination of the Executive, the
Bank continues to pay any amounts owing to the Executive pursuant to Section
6(d) hereof. For purposes of this Agreement, the Executive shall be deemed
directly or indirectly interested in a business if he is engaged or interested
in that business as a stockholder, director, officer, or executive, agent,
partner, individual proprietor, consultant, advisor or otherwise, but not if the
Executive's interest is limited solely to the ownership of not more than 5% of
the securities of any class of equity securities of a corporation or other
person whose shares are listed or admitted to trade on a national securities
exchange or are quoted on Nasdaq or a similar means if Nasdaq is no longer
providing such information.

         (d) While the Executive is employed by the Bank and for one (1) year
after the Executive ceases to be employed by the Bank, the Executive shall not,
directly or indirectly, solicit to employ for himself or others any employee of
the Bank or any Affiliate of the Bank as of the date of the termination of the
Executive's employment with the Bank, or to solicit any such employee to leave
such employee's employment or join the employee of another, then or at a later
time.

         (e) The parties agree that nothing in this agreement shall be construed
to limit or negate the common law of torts, confidentiality, trade secrets,
fiduciary duty and obligations where such laws provide the Bank with any
broader, further or other remedy or protection than those provided herein.

         (f) Because the breach of any of the provisions of this Section 8 will
result in immediate and irreparable injury to the Bank for which the Bank will
not have an adequate remedy at law, the Bank shall be entitled, in addition to
all other rights and remedies, to seek a degree of specific performance of the
restrictive covenants contained in this Section 8 and to a temporary and
permanent injunction enjoining such breach, without posting bond or furnishing
similar security.

    9. WITHHOLDING. All payments required to be made by the Bank hereunder
to the Executive shall be subject to the withholding of such amounts, if any,
relating to tax and other payroll deductions as the Bank may reasonably
determine should be withheld pursuant to any applicable law or regulation.

    10. ASSIGNABILITY. The Bank may assign this Agreement and its rights
and obligations hereunder in whole, but not in part, to any corporation, bank or
other entity with or into which the Bank may hereafter merge or consolidate or
to which the Bank may transfer all or substantially all of its assets, if in any
such case said corporation, bank or other entity shall by operation of law or
expressly in writing assume all obligations of the Bank hereunder as fully as if
it had been originally made a party hereto, but may not otherwise assign this
Agreement or its rights and obligations hereunder. The Executive may not assign
or transfer this Agreement or any rights or obligations hereunder.

    11. NOTICE. For the purposes of this Agreement, notices and all other
communications provided for in this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be
deemed to have been duly given when delivered or mailed by certified or
registered mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, addressed to the
respective addresses set forth on the signature page hereto. Any notice,
request, demand or other communication delivered or sent in the manner aforesaid
shall be deemed given or made (as the case may be) upon the earliest of (a) the
date it is actually received, (b) the business day after the day on which it is
delivered by hand, (c) the business day after the day on which it is properly
delivered to Federal Express (or a comparable overnight delivery service), or
(d) the third business day after the day on which it is deposited in the United
States mail. The Bank or the Executive may change its address by notifying the
other party of the new address in any manner permitted by this Section 11.

    12. AMENDMENT; WAIVER. No provisions of this Agreement may be modified,
waived or discharged unless such waiver, modification or discharge is agreed to
in writing and signed by the Executive and such officer or officers as may be
specifically designated by the Board of Directors of the Bank to sign on its
behalf. No waiver by any party hereto at any time of any breach by any other
party hereto of, or compliance with, any condition or provision of this
Agreement to be performed by such other party shall be deemed a waiver of
similar or dissimilar provisions or conditions at the same or at any prior or
subsequent time.

    13. GOVERNING LAW. The validity, interpretation, construction and
performance of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the United States
where applicable and otherwise by the substantive laws of the Commonwealth of
Virginia.

    14. NATURE OF OBLIGATIONS. Nothing contained herein shall create or
require the Bank to create a trust of any kind to fund any benefits which may be
payable hereunder, and to the extent that the Executive acquires a right to
receive benefits from the Bank hereunder, such right shall be no greater than
the right of any unsecured general creditor of the Bank.

    15. HEADINGS. The section headings contained in this Agreement are for
reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.

    16. VALIDITY. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of
this Agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other
provisions of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect.

    17. COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original but all of which
together will constitute one and the same instrument.

    18. REGULATORY PROHIBITION. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, any payments made to the Executive pursuant to this
Agreement, or otherwise, are subject to and conditioned upon their compliance
with Section 18(k) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. Section
1828(k)) and the regulations promulgated thereunder, including 12 C.F.R. Part
359. Furthermore, following such termination for Cause, the Executive will not,
directly or indirectly, participate in the affairs or the operations of the
Bank.

    19. ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This Agreement embodies the entire agreement
between the Bank and the Executive with respect to the matters agreed to herein.
All prior agreements between the Bank and the Executive with respect to the
matters agreed to herein are hereby superseded and shall have no force or
effect.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Agreement has been executed as of the date first above
written.
