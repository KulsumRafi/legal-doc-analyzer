Mr. Manuel Marrero, CFO
Mossimo, Inc.
2016 Broadway Blvd.
Santa Monica, CA 90404

Dear Manny:

This letter will confirm our phone conversation of 12/2/02 where it was agreed
that based on the receipt of your 12/02 wire for $1,000,000.00, which will
reduce our outstanding loan balance to $1,068,537.42, CIT will release its
security interest in the personal investment account #2CT-30108 of Mossimo
Giannulli held at Merrill Lynch.

It was also agreed that we will maintain the personal guaranty of Mossimo
Giannulli individually and Mossimo Giannulli, as the sole trustee of the Mossimo
Giannulli Trust dated 1/18/95 with an adjustment in the limit cap of the
guaranty from the present $1,000,000.00 to an amount equal to fifty percent
(50%) of the outstanding debt owed to CIT.

Amendments to our legal documentation to reflect the above are in process and
will be forwarded to you for Mossimo's signature as soon as possible.

Regards,

/s/ James E. Ezemoli


James E. Ezemoli
Vice President
