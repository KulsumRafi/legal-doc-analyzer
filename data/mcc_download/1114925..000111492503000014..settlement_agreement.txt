               COMPROMISE SETTLEMENT AND MUTUAL RELEASE AGREEMENT

     This  Compromise  Settlement and Mutual Release Agreement (the "AGREEMENT")
is  made  this  17th  day  of  January  2003,  by  and  among  Lantronix,  Inc.
("LANTRONIX"),  Premise  Systems  Inc.,  a Delaware corporation and wholly owned
subsidiary  of  Lantronix  ("PREMISE"),  and
______________________________, a former shareholder of Premise ("SHAREHOLDER").
     (Please  print  name)

                                    RECITALS

     A. The Shareholder, Lantronix, Premise and certain others are parties to an
Amended and Restated Agreement and Plan of Reorganization, dated January 7, 2002
(the  "ACQUISITION  AGREEMENT")  by  which  Lantronix  acquired  Premise  (the
"ACQUISITION").

     B.  Pursuant  to,  and  on the terms provided in the Acquisition Agreement,
531,686  shares  of  unregistered Lantronix Common Stock are held in escrow (the
"EARNOUT  ESCROW")  and  are to be delivered to Chris Beaumont, Tim Chipman, Jim
Hunter,  James  A.S.  Lewis,  Jeff Manning, Dan Quigley and Jim Springfield (the
"PRINCIPAL STOCKHOLDERS") only in the event certain revenue milestones have been
achieved  by  Premise  on or before March 21, 2003 (the "EARNOUT CRITERION"). In
addition,  106,337  shares  of  unregistered  Lantronix Common Stock are held in
escrow  (the  "INDEMNIFICATION  ESCROW")  to  secure  the performance of certain
obligations  under  the  Acquisition  Agreement  and  are  to be released to the
Principal  Stockholders  on  the  first  anniversary  of  the  closing  of  the
Acquisition.

     C.  Certain  former  shareholders  of  Premise  that  became  employees  of
Lantronix  were granted options to purchase Lantronix Common Stock, and pursuant
to  their stock option agreements, the vesting of 50% of each stock option grant
is  subject  to forfeiture in the event the Earnout Criterion is not achieved on
or  before  March  21,  2003.

     D.  Certain  of  the  former shareholders of Premise have expressed concern
that  the  market  price  of Lantronix's Common Stock prior to and following the
Acquisition  was  artificially  inflated prior to and following the Acquisition,
and  that  they  were  provided  inaccurate  information  in connection with the
negotiation  and  approval Acquisition, and that such misrepresentations to them
and  the  marketplace  has  caused  such former Premise shareholders substantial
harm.  Certain  of  the  former  shareholders  of Premise believe that they have
colorable  claims  against  Lantronix,  its  subsidiaries, affiliates, and their
respective  current  and  former  officers,  directors,  employees, contractors,
agents, and assigns (the "LANTRONIX PARTIES") for legal relief under federal and
state  law  arising  from  or  relating  to  the  Acquisition.

     E.  Notwithstanding  these  potential  claims, the undersigned Shareholder,
Lantronix and Premise, without admission of liability, each wishes to compromise
and  settle  the  dispute and discharge any and all manners of action, causes of
action,  lawsuits,  proceedings,  debts,  dues,  contracts,  judgments, damages,
claims,  proceedings  and  demands  whatsoever,  from the beginning of the world

                                        1

until  the  date  of  this Agreement, whether known or unknown, whether based in
fact,  or law or in equity that the undersigned Shareholder may have or claim to
have relating to, arising from or in any way connected with: (i) the Acquisition
(including,  without  limitation, claims relating to, arising from or in any way
connected  with  the  Acquisition  Agreement,  its  Exhibits  and  any ancillary
agreements,  and  any  and all disclosure or public information available to the
Shareholder  or  other former shareholders of Premise prior to and following the
Acquisition),  (ii)  any  other  agreement  or matter that may exist between the
undersigned  Shareholder and the Lantronix Parties, that is relating to, arising
from,  or in any way connected with Lantronix's acquisition of the capital stock
and  options  of  Premise  from  the undersigned Shareholder or the other former
shareholders  of  Premise,  (iii)  or  the  delivery  of  securities,  including
Lantronix  Common  Stock  and/or options to acquire Lantronix capital stock, and
the  retention,  disposition  or  exercise  of  such  securities.

     F.  Because  Lantronix  desires  to  enter into a Compromise Settlement and
Mutual  Release  Agreement  with  all  or  substantially  all  of  the  former
shareholders  of  Premise,  this  Agreement  shall  only  be  effective upon its
acceptance  by  Lantronix,  which  shall  be  indicated by the execution of this
Agreement  by  Lantronix and Premise, with such acceptance being in the sole and
absolute  discretion  of  Lantronix.

     NOW,  THEREFORE,  in  consideration  of  the  above premises and the mutual
covenants  hereafter  set  forth,  Lantronix,  Premise  and the Shareholder (the
"PARTIES")  agree  as  follows:

     1.   Lantronix  will  promptly  issue to Shareholder a certificate for that
          number  of  shares  of  unregistered  Lantronix Common Stock indicated
          opposite  Shareholder's  name  on  EXHIBIT  A  hereto under the column
          "Additional  Shares  Issued".  The  Shareholder  understands that such
          shares  shall  not be freely transferable, as further described in the
          Information  Statement  previously  delivered  to  the  Shareholder.

     2.   In  the  event the undersigned Shareholder is a Principal Shareholder,
          Lantronix  will  instruct  the escrow agent for the Earnout Escrow and
          Indemnification  Escrow  to  release the unregistered Lantronix Common
          Stock  held  in  Shareholder's  name  in  said  escrows.

     3.   In  the  event  the  undersigned  Shareholder  is  a current Lantronix
          employee  that  is  party  to  an option agreement with Lantronix that
          includes  vesting  based upon Premise achieving the Earnout Criterion,
          Lantronix will amend the stock option agreement to remove such vesting
          restriction.  As  a  result,  any  options  previously  subject to the
          performance-based  vesting,  shall  be  vested,  and shares subject to
          time-based  vesting  shall  continue  to vest as currently provided in
          Shareholder's  existing  option  agreement.

     4.   The  undersigned  Shareholder,  on  behalf of the Shareholder and such
          Shareholder's  heirs,  executors,  administrators  and  assigns  (the
          "SHAREHOLDER PARTIES") hereby absolutely release the Lantronix Parties
          from  any  and  all  manners  of  action,  causes of action, lawsuits,
          proceedings,  debts,  dues,  contracts,  judgments,  damages,  claims,

                                        2

          proceedings  and  demands  whatsoever, from the beginning of the world
          until  the  date  of this Agreement, whether known or unknown, whether
          based  in  fact,  or law or in equity that the undersigned Shareholder
          may  have  or  claim  to  have relating to, arising from or in any way
          connected  with:  (i)  the Acquisition (including, without limitation,
          claims  relating  to,  arising  from  or in any way connected with the
          Acquisition  Agreement, its Exhibits and any ancillary agreements, and
          any  and  all  disclosure  or  public  information  available  to  the
          Shareholder  or  other  former  shareholders  of  Premise prior to and
          following  the  Acquisition),  (ii) any other agreement or matter that
          may  exist  between  the  undersigned  Shareholder  and  the Lantronix
          Parties,  that  is  relating to, arising from, or in any way connected
          with  Lantronix's  acquisition  of  the  capital  stock and options of
          Premise  from  the  undersigned  Shareholder  or  the  other  former
          shareholders  of  Premise,  including,  in  the  event Shareholder has
          served  as  an employee a Lantronix Party, from such employment, (iii)
          or the delivery of securities, including Lantronix Common Stock and/or
          options  to  acquire  Lantronix  capital  stock,  and  the  retention,
          disposition  or  exercise  of  such  securities  that  the Shareholder
          Parties might have. The Undersigned Shareholder hereby agrees to waive
          all  rights  under  that certain Investor Rights Agreement between the
          former shareholders of Premise and Lantronix, and hereby agrees to the
          termination  of  all rights, including registration rights, and agrees
          to  the  amendment  of  such  Investor  Rights Agreement to delete all
          rights,  including  the  rights  granted  pursuant  to  Section  4
          Registration,  under  such  agreement.  The  undersigned  Shareholder
          acknowledges  that  the  Shareholder  shall  remain  bound  by  the
          obligations  under  such  Investor  Rights  Agreement.

     5.   Lantronix  and Premise each hereby absolutely releases the Shareholder
          Parties  from  any  and  all  manners  of  action,  causes  of action,
          lawsuits,  proceedings,  debts,  dues,  contracts, judgments, damages,
          claims,  proceedings and demands whatsoever, from the beginning of the
          world  until  the  date  of  this Agreement, whether known or unknown,
          whether  based  in  fact,  or  law  or  in equity that the undersigned
          Shareholder  may have or claim to have relating to, arising from or in
          any  way  connected  with:  (i)  the  Acquisition  (including, without
          limitation,  claims  relating to, arising from or in any way connected
          with  the  Acquisition  Agreement,  its  Exhibits  and  any  ancillary
          agreements, and any and all disclosure or public information available
          to  the  Shareholder  or other former shareholders of Premise prior to
          and  following  the  Acquisition),  (ii) any other agreement or matter
          that  may  exist between the undersigned Shareholder and the Lantronix
          Parties,  that  is  relating to, arising from, or in any way connected
          with  Lantronix's  acquisition  of  the  capital  stock and options of
          Premise  from  the  undersigned  Shareholder  or  the  other  former
          shareholders  of  Premise,  (iii)  or  the  delivery  of  securities,
          including  Lantronix  Common Stock and/or options to acquire Lantronix

     6.   With  respect  to  the  matters  referenced  in  Paragraphs  4  and 5,
          Lantronix,  Premise  and  the  Shareholder Parties waive all rights or
          benefits  conferred  by the provisions of 1542 of the California Civil
          Code,  which  provides:

          A  GENERAL  RELEASE  DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES
          NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE
          RELEASE,  WHICH  IF  KNOWN  BY  HIM  MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS
          SETTLEMENT  WITH  THE  DEBTOR.

          The  Parties,  being  aware  of  this  Code Section, hereby expressly,
          knowingly and intentionally waive any rights they may have thereunder,
          as well as under any other statute or common law principles of similar
          effect.

     7.   The  Parties agree that any dispute arising out of or relating to this
          Agreement  or  the  breach  thereof  shall be resolved through binding
          arbitration  in  Orange  County,  California  using  the  services  of
          American  Arbitration  Association  or  JAMS Endispute. Any arbitrator
          must  be  independent,  and  shall  have no prior business or personal
          relationship  with the attorneys or other professional advisors of any
          of  their  parties  or their affiliates of such nature to cause actual
          bias  or  a reasonable appearance of bias. The parties agrees that the
          arbitrator  shall  issue  a  written  decision on the merits, and also
          agree  that the arbitrator shall have the power to award any remedies,
          including  attorneys'  fees and costs, available under applicable law.
          Each  party  shall  pay  one-half  of the arbitrator's fees and costs,
          unless  one  party is ruled the prevailing party by the arbitrator, in
          which  case  the arbitrator, subsequent to the arbitration itself, may
          award  the  prevailing  party  attorney's  fees  and  costs.

     8.   The  Parties  agree  and  represent  that  they  have  not  assigned,
          hypothecated or transferred to any entity, person, or corporation, any
          of  their  claims  related  to  the  dispute.

     9.   This  Agreement is a compromise of the above-mentioned disputed claims
          and  shall  never be treated as an admission of liability by any Party
          for  any  purpose.  The  existence  and  terms  of  this Agreement are
          strictly  confidential  and  shall  not  be disclosed to any non-Party
          except  to  the  extent  required  by  law.

     This  Agreement constitutes the full and entire understanding and agreement
between  the  Parties  regarding  the  matters set forth herein.  Each Party has
fully  investigated  the subject matter of this Agreement and has consulted such
independent  legal,  tax  and accounting experts to the extent such Party deemed
prudent,  and  does  not  rely on any statement of fact or opinion of any of the
other  Parties  to  this  Agreement.

     This  Agreement  shall  have no force or effect until signed by each of the
Shareholder,  Lantronix  and  Premise.
