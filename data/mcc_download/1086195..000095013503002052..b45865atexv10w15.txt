Mr. John Dragoon

Dear John:

     Below is an addendum to your original ATG employment offer. Please review
and let me know if you have any questions.

     - The variable portion of your total compensation package is set at 50% of
     your base pay at your time of hire. Your bonus plan is pro-rated according
     to your start date.

     - In the event of a Change of Control of more than 50% of ATG's outstanding
     common shares, 50% of your unvested option holdings at that time will be
     vested. In the event of your position being eliminated within one year of
     the change of control, you would be granted a 6-month severance benefit.

     - You will have 4 weeks of vacation to be accrued on a monthly basis after
     your start date. Please work out the details of the 4th week with your
     manager.

As acceptance of this offer, please sign and fax back both the original offer
and this addendum letter to 617-386-5190.

Sincerely,                              Agreed and Accepted:
