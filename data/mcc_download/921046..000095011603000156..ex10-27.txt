         This Amendment is based on the following recitals ("Recitals"), which
are incorporated into and made a part of this Amendment:

         1. The Banks and the Borrowers are parties to an Amended and Restated
Credit Agreement dated as of January 22, 1999, as amended by a First Amendment
to Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of June 14, 2000, a Second

<PAGE>

         2. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that (i) the Amendment Agreement
is in full force and effect; (ii) the Banks have fully performed all of their
obligations under the Loan Documents (including the Amendment Agreement); (iii)
the Banks have no obligation to continue to lend to Borrowers or to forbear from
enforcing their rights and remedies beyond the Forbearance Period; and (iv) the
Banks have made no representations of any nature or kind that funding in any
amount will continue, or that the Forbearance Period will be extended beyond the
expiration thereof.

         3. Each Party represents and warrants to the Banks that it has received
direct and substantial economic benefit from all of the Obligations and that it
will continue to receive direct and substantial economic benefit from such
loans, and from any other loans made or which may be made in the future to any
of the Borrowers.

         4. Under the terms of the Amendment Agreement, the Parties previously
agreed to satisfy all of the Obligations by February 15, 2002, which date was
subsequently extended to December 31, 2002, and under the terms of the Amendment
Agreement all Obligations were due and owing in full on those dates. Despite
reductions in the Obligations during the past year, the Parties have advised the
Lenders that they will be unable to satisfy all of the Obligations by December
31, 2002 due to an inability to complete their plan for asset sales and
corporate refinancing by that date but have advised the Lenders that they intend
to continue to implement the plan and believe that continuation of the plan will
result in satisfaction in full of the Obligations by December 31, 2003.

         5. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Sixteenth Amendment, and
in reliance on the Parties' agreements, acknowledgments, representations, and
warranties in this Sixteenth Amendment, the Banks have agreed to amend the Loan
Documents, and forbear from enforcing their rights and remedies on account of
the Specified Defaults under the Loan Documents and applicable law, as set forth
below.

                                    AGREEMENT
                                    ---------

        Based on the foregoing Recitals (which are incorporated herein as
representations, warranties, acknowledgments and agreements of the parties, as
the case may be) and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
adequacy of which is mutually acknowledged by the parties hereto, Borrowers and
Banks agree as follows:

         A. The Loan Agreement and Amendment Agreement are amended as follows:

                  (1) Section 2.2(d) of the Loan Agreement is amended and

                  at the following times in accordance with the terms of this
                  Section 2.2:

</TABLE>

                  As part of the calculation of the cumulative reduction, the
         Commitments will reduce on a dollar for dollar basis by 100% of the net
         cash proceeds (net only of reasonable costs of closing pursuant to sale
         terms and conditions acceptable to the Banks in their reasonable
         discretion) promptly upon the Borrowers' receipt thereof of the sale of
         any of the assets of the Borrowers, including without limitation the
         real estate owned by Cramer and the Texas Property, by 100% of the face
         value of any Letter of Credit or full amount of any cash deposit
         related thereto returned to either of the Banks promptly upon the
         Borrowers' receipt thereof and by 100% of any tax refunds other than
         the Property Refund (which is an additional reduction to the
         Commitments as discussed below).

                  In addition to the reductions set forth above, the Commitments
         will reduce by (i) if the Property Refund is received on or before
         February 28, 2003, the greater of $408,680 or the amount of the
         Property Refund promptly upon the Borrowers' receipt of the Property
         Refund, or (ii) if the Property Refund is not received on or before
         February 28, 2003, by $408,680 on February 28, 2003 and by any amount
         by which the Property Refund exceeds $408,680 promptly upon the
         Borrowers' receipt of the Property Refund."

                  (2) The definition of "Additional Amount" in Section 1.1 of
         the Loan Agreement is amended and restated in its entirety to read as
         follows:

                           ""Additional Amount" means $6,985,000, less the
                  following amounts immediately upon the Borrowers' receipt
                  thereof: 100% of the net cash proceeds (net only of reasonable
                  costs of closing pursuant to sale terms and conditions
                  acceptable to the Banks in their reasonable discretion) of the
                  sale of any of the assets of the Borrowers, including without
                  limitation the real estate owned by Cramer and the Texas
                  Property; the face value of any Letter of Credit or full
                  amount of any cash deposit related thereto returned to either
                  of the Banks; and the amount of any reduction in the
                  Commitments permitted or required under Section 2(a) and/or
                  2(d) of the Loan Agreement."

                  (3) The definition of "Termination Date" in Section 1.1 of the
         Loan Agreement is amended to revise the reference to "December 31,
         2002" to instead read "December 31, 2003".

                  (4) Section 1 of the Amendment Agreement is amended and
         restated in its entirety to read as follows:

                  Lenders agree to forbear from enforcing their rights and
                  remedies, whether under the Loan Documents or otherwise
                  available at law or in equity in connection therewith, based
                  on the Specified Defaults and the Additional Defaults (as
                  defined in the Sixteenth Amendment); as well as their rights
                  and remedies based solely on any worsening of the Specified
                  Defaults or the Additional Defaults or any future defaults
                  arising only under Sections 5.2(a), (b) or (c) of the Loan
                  Agreement, through December 31, 2003 (the "Forbearance
                  Period")

                           (b) There are no further or additional Events of
                  Default, or defaults under this Agreement or the Loan
                  Documents, and each Party complies with all terms and
                  conditions of this Agreement and the Loan Documents to which

         restated in its entirety to read as follows:

                           "(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the

                  expenditures for the period from November 1, 2001 through

         unreturned Letters of Credit."

Agreement for the months of ________________________ (the "Additional
Defaults"). The Banks agree to forbear with respect to the Additional Defaults

to or agreement to forbear with respect to any future defaults or Events of
Default.

         D. In addition to continuing to pay the commitment fee and any and all
other fees provided for under the Loan Documents, Borrowers must pay to the
Agent, for the benefit of the Banks, an amendment fee of $100,000, which has
been fully earned by the Banks and is payable as follows: $25,000 simultaneous
with execution of this Sixteenth Amendment and $25,000 each on or before the
15th day of March, June and September, 2003, provided, however, that any portion
of the amendment fee that is payable after the date that the Borrowers fully and
finally pay all of the Obligations in full (including returning undrawn or cash
collateralizing any Letters of Credit) will be waived by the Banks.

         E. The Borrowers acknowledge and agree that the Agent will conduct a
field examination in or about January 2003 and that all fees and costs related
to such field exam must be paid by Borrowers within thirty days of their receipt

         F. From and after the date of this Amendment, references in the Loan
Documents (i) to the Loan Agreement are to be treated as referring to the Loan
Agreement, as amended by this Amendment, (ii) to the Amendment Agreement are to
be treated as referring to the Amendment Agreement, as amended by this
Amendment; (iii) to the Notes are to be treated as referring to the New Notes,
and (iv) to "obligations", "Obligations" and "liabilities" are to be treated as
referring to all indebtedness and obligations referred to in this Amendment or
the Loan Documents.

         G. Subsequent to execution and delivery of this Amendment, Borrowers
must cause to be executed and delivered to the Banks such financing statements,
resolutions and other agreements that the Banks may reasonably require to
effectuate the transactions contemplated by this Amendment. Borrowers must
continue to pay all costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees)
incurred by the Banks in accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents,
including the Amendment Agreement.

         H. Each Borrower expressly acknowledges and agrees that (i) each
Borrower, jointly, jointly and severally, and severally remains liable for any

                  (a) The Amendment Agreement grants a limited forbearance until
the expiration of the Forbearance Period on the terms and conditions set forth

such forbearance through the expiration of the Forbearance Period and
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Sixteenth Amendment or the
Amendment Agreement, all of the Banks' rights and remedies with respect to the
Parties are expressly reserved. Likewise, nothing herein shall be deemed to
constitute a waiver of any default existing as of the date hereof or new Events
of Default or defaults or shall in any way prejudice the rights and remedies of
the Banks under the Loan Documents (including the Amendment Agreement) or
applicable law. Further, the Banks shall have the right to waive any conditions
set forth in this Sixteenth Amendment or the Loan Documents, in their sole
discretion, and any waiver shall not prejudice, waive or reduce any other right
or remedy which the Banks may have against the Parties or any of them. However,

Sixteenth Amendment or the Loan Documents shall be effective unless contained in
a writing signed by an authorized agent of the Agent or each of the Banks, as
appropriate.

                  (b) ANYTHING CONTAINED IN THIS SIXTEENTH AMENDMENT OR IN ANY
OTHER AGREEMENT TO THE CONTRARY NOTWITHSTANDING, NOTHING CONTAINED IN THIS
SIXTEENTH AMENDMENT OR IN ANY OTHER AGREEMENT SHALL IN ANY WAY RESTRICT OR
PROHIBIT THE BANKS' RIGHT TO BLOCK, STOP OR PROHIBIT PAYMENTS TO ANY
SUBORDINATED CREDITOR

         K. Each Borrower represents and warrants to the Banks that:

                  (1) (a) The execution, delivery and performance of this
         Amendment by the Borrowers and all agreements and documents delivered
         by Borrowers in connection with this Amendment have been duly
         authorized by all necessary corporate or other organizational action
         and does not and will not require any consent or approval of its
         stockholders or members, violate any provision of any law, rule,
         regulation, order, writ, judgment, injunction, decree, determination or
         award presently in effect having applicability to it or of its articles
         of incorporation, articles of organization, or bylaws, or result in a
         breach of or constitute a default under any indenture or loan or credit
         agreement or any other agreement, lease or instrument to which any
         Borrower is a party or by which it or its properties may be bound or
         affected.

                  (b) No authorization, consent, approval, license, exemption of
         or filing a registration with any court or governmental department,
         commission, board, bureau, agency or instrumentality, domestic or
         foreign, is or will be necessary to the valid execution, delivery or
         performance by Borrowers of this Amendment and all agreements and
         documents delivered in connection with this Amendment.

                  (c) This Amendment and all agreements and documents delivered
         by Borrowers in connection with this Amendment are the legal, valid and
         binding obligations of each Borrower enforceable against it in
         accordance with the terms thereof.

                  (2) After giving effect to the amendments contained in this
         Amendment, all of the representations and warranties contained in the
         Loan Documents are true and correct in all material respects on and as
         of the date hereof with the same force and effect as if made on and as
         of the date hereof.

                  (3) Each Borrower's interim financial statements furnished to
         the Banks, which have been provided through September, 2002, fairly
         present such Borrower's financial condition as of such dates and the
         results of such Borrower's operations for the periods indicated. The
         Borrowers' consolidated financial statements have been prepared in
         accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a
         consistent basis, and since the date of the last such financial
         statement there has been no material adverse change in such financial
         condition.

                  (4) Except for the Specified Defaults, such Borrower has duly
         and properly performed, complied with and observed each of its
         covenants, agreements, and obligations contained in the Loan Documents.

                  (5) Any party executing this Sixteenth Amendment in a
         representative capacity on behalf of such Borrower has the authority to
         execute this Sixteenth Amendment and legally bind such Borrower.

                  (6) Such Borrower has not assigned any claim, set off or
         defense to any individual or entity.

         L. This Sixteenth Amendment and all of the Exhibits and other written
material delivered by any one or more of the Parties to the Banks in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby do not contain any statement that is
false or misleading with respect to any material fact and do not omit to state a
material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein not false or
misleading. There is no additional fact of which any Party is aware that has not
been disclosed in writing to the Banks that materially affects adversely or, so
far as each Party can reasonably foresee, will materially affect adversely, any
Party's financial condition or business prospects.

         M. The terms and provisions of this Amendment amend, add to and
constitute a part of the Loan Agreement, the Amendment Agreement and the other
Loan Documents. Except as expressly modified and amended by the terms of this
Amendment, all of the other terms and conditions of the Loan Agreement, the
Amendment Agreement and the other Loan Documents remain in full force and effect
and are ratified, reaffirmed, confirmed, and approved.

         N. No failure or delay on the part of the Agent or either of the Banks
in the exercise of any power or right, and no course of dealing between any one
or more of the Parties and the Agent or either of the Banks, operates as a
waiver of such power or right, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any
power or right preclude other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any
other power or right. The remedies provided for herein are cumulative and not
exclusive of any remedies which may be available to the Agent or either of the
Banks at law or in equity. No notice to or demand on any Party not required
hereunder or under the Loan Documents entitles any such Party to any other or
further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances, or waives the right
of the Agent or either of the Banks to any other or further action in any
circumstances without notice or demand. Any waiver of any provision of this
Sixteenth Amendment or the Loan Documents and any consent to any departure by
any one or more of the Parties from the terms of any provision of this Sixteenth
Amendment or the Loan Documents is effective only if in writing signed by an
authorized officer of the Agent or the Banks, as appropriate, and only in the
specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given.

         O. All agreements, representations and warranties made in this
Sixteenth Amendment (and all agreements referred to or incorporated herein)
survive the execution of this Sixteenth Amendment (and all documents and
agreements referred to or incorporated herein). Notwithstanding anything in this
Sixteenth Amendment (or any documents or agreements referred to or incorporated
herein) to the contrary, no investigation or inquiry by the Agent or the Banks
(including by their agents) with respect to any matter which is the subject of
any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement set forth herein or
therein is intended, nor shall it be interpreted, to limit, diminish or
otherwise affect the full scope and effect of any such representation, warranty,
covenant or other agreement. All terms, covenants, agreements, representations
and warranties of each Party made herein (or in any documents or agreements
referred to or incorporated herein), or in any certificate or other document
delivered or to be delivered pursuant hereto, are deemed to be material and to
have been relied upon by the Agent and the Banks, notwithstanding any
investigation heretofore or hereafter made by the Agent or the Banks or their
agents.

         P. The execution and delivery of this Sixteenth Amendment (and all
agreements and documents referred to herein) does not impair or affect any other
security (by endorsement or otherwise) for the Obligations, or any one or more
of the Parties' other obligations to the Banks. No security taken before or
after as security for the Obligations impairs or affects this Sixteenth
Amendment (or any agreement or document referred to herein). All present and
future additional security is to be considered as cumulative security.

         Q. This Sixteenth Amendment and the Exhibits and Schedules hereto
constitute the Parties' and the Banks' entire understanding with respect to the
subject matter hereof. Modifications or amendments to this Sixteenth Amendment
must be in writing and signed by the party to be charged in order to be
effective. This Sixteenth Amendment is governed by the internal laws of the
State of Michigan (without regard to conflicts of law principles). This
Sixteenth Amendment is binding on each Party and their respective successors,
assigns, heirs, and personal representatives and shall inure to the Banks'
benefit and the benefit of their successors and assigns. If any provision of
this Sixteenth Amendment conflicts with any applicable statute or law, or is
otherwise unenforceable, such offending provision is null and void only to the
extent of such conflict or unenforceability, and is deemed separate from and
does not invalidate any other provision of this Sixteenth Amendment.

         R. This Sixteenth Amendment is being entered into among competent
persons, who are experienced in business and represented by counsel, and has
been reviewed by the Parties and their counsel, if any. Therefore, any ambiguous
language in this Sixteenth Amendment will not necessarily be construed against
any particular party as the drafter of such language.

         S. If there is an express conflict between the terms of this Amendment
and the terms of the Loan Agreement or the other Loan Documents, the terms of
this Amendment govern and control.

         T. This Amendment may be executed in any number of counterparts with
the same effect as if all signatories had signed the same document. All
counterparts must be construed together to constitute one instrument.

         U. STATUTE OF FRAUDS. THIS SIXTEENTH AMENDMENT REPRESENTS THE FINAL
AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE BANKS AND THE PARTIES WITH REGARD TO THE SUBJECT MATTER
HEREOF AND MAY NOT BE CONTRADICTED BY EVIDENCE OF PRIOR, CONTEMPORANEOUS OR
SUBSEQUENT ORAL AGREEMENTS OF THE PARTIES. ALL PRIOR AND CONTEMPORANEOUS ORAL
AGREEMENTS, IF ANY, BETWEEN EITHER OF THE BANKS OR THE AGENT, ON THE ONE HAND,
AND ANY ONE OR MORE OF THE PARTIES, ON THE OTHER HAND, ARE MERGED INTO THIS
SIXTEENTH AMENDMENT AND SHALL NOT SURVIVE THE EXECUTION OF THIS SIXTEENTH
AMENDMENT.

         V. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL.

         BORROWERS AND BANKS EACH ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY
IS A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT, BUT THAT THE RIGHT MAY BE WAIVED. BORROWERS AND BANKS
EACH KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY, IRREVOCABLY AND WITHOUT COERCION, WAIVE ALL RIGHTS
TO TRIAL BY JURY OF ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN THEM. NEITHER OF THE BANKS NOR ANY
BORROWER SHALL BE DEEMED TO HAVE GIVEN UP THIS WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL UNLESS THE
PARTY CLAIMING THAT THIS WAIVER HAS BEEN RELINQUISHED HAS A WRITTEN INSTRUMENT
SIGNED BY THE OTHER PARTY STATING THAT THIS WAIVER HAS BEEN GIVEN UP.
