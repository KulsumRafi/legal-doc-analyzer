substantially in the form set forth in Exhibit&nbsp;B (a "Continued Employment Period Agreement"); and (iii)&nbsp;upon a termination of the Executive's employment at the end of the Continued Employment Period or under circumstances described in

Death or Disability</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Executive's employment shall terminate automatically upon his or her death during any Employment Period. In the event that (a)&nbsp;the Committee determines in good faith that an
Executive is suffering from a "Disability" (together with its various cognates, as defined below) and (b)&nbsp;the appropriate decisionmaker under any applicable Company plan or program providing long-term disability benefits to the Executive (a
"Disability Plan") similarly determines that the Executive is eligible for such benefits by virtue of the Executive's disability (as defined for purposes of such plan or program), the Company may deliver to the Executive written notice (a "Disability
Termination Notice") in accordance with Section&nbsp;6.05 above of the Company's intention to terminate the Executive's employment. In such event, the Executive's employment shall terminate effective on the later of (y)&nbsp;the 30th day after
receipt of such Disability Termination Notice by the Executive or (z)&nbsp;the first date on which the Executive becomes eligible for long-term disability benefits under the principal Disability Plan applicable to the Executive (the "Disability
Effective Date"), provided, however, that (1)&nbsp;in the interim the Executive shall not have returned to full-time performance of the Executive's duties and/or (2)&nbsp;the Executive shall not have delivered to the Committee within 30&nbsp;days of
receipt of a Disability Termination Notice a written objection thereto (an "Objection"). In the event of a timely Objection, any termination of the Executive shall be suspended and the Executive shall be promptly examined by two physicians or other
professionals skilled in the relevant field, one selected by the Executive and one by the Committee. Each of the two professionals shall issue a written opinion within 15&nbsp;days following the completion of his or her examination as to whether the
Executive is Disabled in accordance with the definition provided in this Plan. If the two professionals agree, each of the Executive and the Company shall be bound by their joint conclusion. If the two professionals disagree, they shall jointly agree
on a third professional to conduct a similar examination. Each of the Executive and the Company shall be bound by the conclusion of such third professional. The Executive agrees to each such examination and to waive any confidentiality rights
necessary to allow each of the professionals conducting such examinations to do so. The Company shall pay all fees and costs of all such examinations. In the event of a disagreement as to the determination of the Executive's disability for purposes
of a Disability Plan, such disagreement shall be resolved as provided for in such Disability Plan. For purposes of this Plan, the term "Disability" shall mean the material inability of the Executive, due to injury, illness, disease or bodily, mental
or emotional infirmity, to carry out the job responsibilities which such Executive held or the tasks to which such Executive was assigned at the time of the incurrence of such Disability, which inability is reasonably expected to be permanent or of

Cause.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company may terminate an Executive's employment at any time for Cause. For purposes of this Plan, "Cause" means: (i)&nbsp;the willful failure of an Executive to perform substantially all of
the Executive's material duties with the Company (other than any failure resulting from incapacity resulting from physical or mental illness), after written demand for substantial performance is delivered to the Executive by the Committee or the CEO;
or (ii)&nbsp;a willful violation of the Company's material rules and policies (including without limitation the Standards of Business Conduct) as in effect from time to time; or (iii)&nbsp;the Executive's commission of any act or acts involving
dishonesty, breach of fiduciary obligation to the Company, fraud, illegality, malfeasance or moral turpitude; or (iv)&nbsp;the Executive commits a criminal or civil violation or other improper act involving fraud or dishonesty; or (v)&nbsp;the
Executive is found liable for or guilty in a civil matter of engaging in discriminatory conduct in violation of any labor or employment laws or in violating or contributing to a violation of an employee's civil rights; or (vi)&nbsp;the Executive
materially breaches the terms of the Plan by revoking any Agreement that the Executive is required to execute, or by failing properly to execute, or violating any one or more of the provisions of, any Agreement that the Executive is required to
execute; or (vii)&nbsp;the Executive refuses to carry out clearly assigned material duties or is otherwise insubordinate. Any act or failure to act, on the part of an Executive, that is described in clause&nbsp;(i), (ii), (vi) or (vii) of the
preceding sentence of which the Committee receives actual notice shall not be considered "Cause" unless the Committee, the Board or an executive officer of the Company notifies the Executive that such act or failure to act is or may be considered
"Cause" within one year after the Committee first receives such actual notice. For purposes of this provision, no act or failure to act, on the part of an Executive, shall be considered "willful," unless it is done, or omitted to be done, by the
Executive in bad faith or without reasonable belief that the Executive's action or omission was in the best interests of the Company. Any act, or failure to act, on the part of an Executive, based upon authority given pursuant to a resolution duly
adopted by the Board or upon the instructions of the CEO or an officer of the Company senior in rank to the Executive to whom the Executive reports or based upon the advice of counsel for the Company shall be conclusively presumed to be done, or
omitted to be done, by the Executive in good faith and in the best interests of the Company. The cessation of employment of an Executive shall not be deemed to be for Cause unless and until there shall have been delivered to the Executive a copy of a
resolution duly adopted by the affirmative vote of a majority of the Board at a meeting of the Board called and held upon appropriate notice (after reasonable notice is provided to the Executive and the Executive is given an opportunity, together
with counsel, to be heard before the Board), finding that, in the good faith opinion of the Board, the Executive is guilty of the conduct described in this paragraph, and specifying the particulars thereof in detail.</FONT></TD>

Governing Law.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Plan is an "employee benefit plan" within the meaning of Section&nbsp;3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"). It is intended to constitute a
"welfare plan" within the meaning of Section&nbsp;3(1) of ERISA, but to the extent it is held to be a "pension plan" within the meaning of Section&nbsp;3(2) of ERISA, it constitutes an unfunded plan maintained primarily for the purpose of providing
deferred compensation for a select group of management or highly compensated employees. To the extent not preempted by federal law, this Plan and all Agreements shall be interpreted and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Illinois,
without regard to any otherwise applicable conflicts of law or choice of law principles.</FONT></TD>

foregoing waiver shall not apply to any right the Executive may have to any gross-up payments related to the excise tax on excess parachute payments imposed by Section&nbsp;4999 of the
Internal Revenue Code under any change of control employment agreement with the Company. The foregoing shall not be construed as affecting in any manner the Executive's benefits and entitlements (if
