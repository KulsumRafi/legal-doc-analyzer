                               SIXTH AMENDMENT TO
                         SERVICES AND SUPPORT AGREEMENT

         This Sixth Amendment to Service and Support Agreement (the "SIXTH
AMENDMENT") effective as of October 1, 2002 (the "EFFECTIVE DATE") is by and
between Coast Dental Services, Inc., a Florida corporation ("CDS") and Coast
Florida, P.A., a Florida professional corporation (the "DENTAL PRACTICE ENTITY"
or the "P.A.").

         WHEREAS, CDS and Dental Practice Entity are parties to that certain
Services and Support Agreement dated as of October 1, 1996, amended on June 1,
1997, further amended on October 1, 1998, further amended on February 1, 1999,
further amended on January 1, 2000, and further amended on June 1, 2002 (the
"SERVICES AND SUPPORT AGREEMENT");

         WHEREAS, CDS and Dental Practice Entity desire to amend the Services
and Support Agreement to change the methodology for determining the monthly
services and support fee (the "S&S FEE") earned by CDS for its services and
support to Dental Practice Entity;

         WHEREAS, this change was precipitated by the favorable impact on the
financial performance of Dental Centers converted to the recently implemented
Dental Equity Model, which model provides the equity dentist and the Dental
Practice Entity an incentive for improving financial performance. This amendment
will incorporate the financial performance of each Dental Center in the
determination of the S&S Fee earned by CDS.

         NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged by the parties, the parties agree
to modify, supplement and amend the Services and Support Agreement as follows:

         1.       Recitals. The statements contained in the Recitals of facts
set forth above are true and correct and are by this reference made a part of
this Sixth Amendment.

         2.       Exhibit A. Exhibit "A" to the Services and Support Agreement
is hereby deleted in its entirety and the Exhibit "A" attached hereto is
substituted therefor.

         3.       Other Provisions. All of the term and provisions contained in
the Services and Support Agreement shall remain in full force and effect unless
specifically modified, supplemented or amended by this Sixth Amendment. Defined
terms used but not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings given to
