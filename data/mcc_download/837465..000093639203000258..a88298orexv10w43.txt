Seller and the Servicer will not owe any amounts to the Purchaser or the Agents
for any reason under the Purchase Agreement or any of the other Related
Documents; provided, however, that all or a portion of such amounts shall be
reinstated in the event and to the extent that any payment thereof is rescinded
or must otherwise be disgorged or returned by the Purchaser or either Agent upon
the insolvency, dissolution, liquidation, bankruptcy or reorganization of the
Seller or the Servicer or upon or as a result of the appointment of a trustee,
receiver or conservator or similar officer for the Seller or the Servicer or any
substantial part of its property.

            8. Miscellaneous. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED
IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK. This Agreement shall be
binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and assigns. This Agreement may be executed in any number
of several counterparts, and each such counterpart shall constitute an original
and all such counterparts together shall constitute one and the same instrument.
