                   Amendment to the BankAtlantic Bancorp, Inc.
                             1999 Stock Option Plan


Paragraph 11 of the BankAtlantic Bancorp 1996 Stock Option Plan was replace with
the following paragraph:

         11.     TRANSFERABILITY OF OPTIONS.

                 During an Optionee's lifetime, an Option may be
                 exercisable only by the Optionee and an Option granted
                 under the Plan and the rights and privileges conferred
                 thereby shall not be subject to execution, attachment,
                 or similar process and may not be sold, pledged,
                 assigned, hypothecated, transferred, or otherwise
                 disposed of in any manner (whether by operation of law
                 or otherwise) other than by will or by the laws of
                 descent and distribution. Notwithstanding the
                 foregoing to the extent permitted by applicable law
                 and rule 16(b)-3, the Committee may determine that any
                 Stock Option may be transferred by an Optionee to any
                 of the following:


                  (1)      a family member of the Optionee;

                  (2)      a Trust established primarily for the benefit of the
                           Optionee and/or a family member of said Optionee;

                  (3)      any charitable organization exempt from income tax
                           under Section 501(c)(3) of the Code (collectively, a
                           "Transferee").

                  Any other attempt to sell, pledge, assign, hypothecate,
                  transfer or otherwise dispose of any Option under the Plan or
                  of any right or privilege conferred thereby, contrary to the
                  provisions of the Plan, or the sale or levy or any attachment
                  or similar process upon the rights and privileges conferred
                  hereby shall be null and void.
