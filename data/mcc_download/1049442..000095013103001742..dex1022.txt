         Subsidiaries), in each case that would be required to be reflected on a
         consolidated balance sheet of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries
         prepared as of such time in accordance with GAAP (excluding any such
         "cash" that is not available funds), minus (ii) the aggregate amount of

         reduce such cash and cash equivalents) on such Business Day, is more
         than $5,000,000, then on such Business Day the Borrower shall prepay
         Revolving Borrowings and Swingline Loans to the extent necessary so
         that, after giving effect to such prepayment and the receipt by the
         Borrower of the proceeds of any Revolving Borrowings and Swingline

         the requested date of such Borrowing (after giving effect to such
         Borrowing) shall not exceed $5,000,000, and such Borrowing Request
         shall contain a statement to that effect and to the effect that the
         Borrower reasonably and in good faith expects to be in compliance with

         or fiscal year of the Borrower ending on or before December 31, 2004,
         any Trigger Event shall have occurred with respect to the last day of
         such fiscal quarter or fiscal year, then on or before the Delivery Day,
         the Borrower shall obtain cash pursuant to a Specified Equity Offering

         Equity Offerings (other than cash that constitutes Initial Equity
         Offering Proceeds or Voluntary Equity Offering Proceeds) would exceed
         $25,000,000. For purposes of this Section, "Compliance Amount" means,
         at any time, the greater of (a) $5,000,000 for the first Trigger Event
         or $1,000,000 for each subsequent Trigger Event and (b) the greater of

         Total Debt as of such day that could have existed without causing an
         Event of Default as of such day under Section 6.14 (calculated using
         Consolidated EBITDA for the period of four consecutive fiscal quarters
         of the Borrower ended on such day) and (ii) the amount, if any, by
         which the portion of Total Debt (determined without regard to any
         reduction pursuant to clause (c) of the definition of "Total Debt")
         accounted for by Senior Debt as of the last day of the most recently
         completed fiscal quarter of the Borrower exceeded the maximum amount of

         that could have existed without causing the Senior Debt Leverage Ratio
         to be in excess of the Target Senior Leverage Ratio as of such day
         (calculated using Consolidated EBITDA for the period of four
         consecutive fiscal quarters of the Borrower ended on such day).

         consolidated balance sheet of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries
         prepared as of such time in accordance with GAAP, minus (b) the
         aggregate amount of payments in such cash and cash equivalents that the
         Borrower reasonably and in good faith determines will be made by the
         Foreign Subsidiaries (and will reduce such cash and cash equivalents)
         on such day to exceed $15,000,000.

               SECTION 7. Amendment to Section 6.09. Section 6.09(a) of the
Credit Agreement is hereby amended by (a) replacing the word "and" immediately
before clause (iv) of such Section with the text "," and (b) inserting the text

Default has occurred and is continuing.

               SECTION 12. Amendment Fee. In consideration of the agreements of

if, at any time and from time to time, the Borrower is required to obtain an
amount of cash from a Specified Equity Offering pursuant to Section 5.15 of the
Credit Agreement, then on such day the Equity Purchaser shall, unless the Equity
Purchaser shall cause an Affiliate thereof (other than the Borrower or any of
