          from such genotypes or performing any statistical analyses to
          correlate genotypes with a phenotype. Furthermore, such Genotyping
          Services shall not be considered to be part of any Research Project
          hereunder except at the sole discretion of Janssen. Prior to
          commencing Genotyping Services for a particular project, the parties
          shall agree in writing on the scope of the services to be provided,
          including, without limitation, whether the project will be considered

          frame for completing the services, and the written description of this
          project ("Genotyping Project") shall be appended to EXHIBIT J of this
          Agreement. Janssen, at its option, may pay Genaissance for such
          Genotyping Services from the minimum HAP Typing Services
          payment owed by Janssen pursuant to Section 4.4 at the same rate of
          $[**]. Upon full utilization by Janssen of such minimum HAP Typing

     S.   Section 4.2 is hereby amended to read as follows:

                 4.2.   SET-UP FEE. For each Research Project mutually agreed to
          be performed by Genaissance pursuant to Section 3.1(a) involving a
          Drug or Diagnostic Product for which more than [**] of Genaissance's
          services, excluding the time of the Genaissance project manager
          described in EXHIBIT F, will be required to assist in preparation of
          the plan for the Research Project, Janssen shall pay to Genaissance a
          nonrefundable set-up fee (the "Set-Up Fee") in an amount to be
          determined by the Steering Committee, based on payment to Genaissance
          at the rate of $[**]. No set-up fee shall be due for the first [**]
          such Research Projects initiated during the Access Period. For
          purposes of clarity, the first [**] such Research Projects for which
          no set-up [**] is due are the [**] Research Project described in
          EXHIBIT H2, the [**] Research Project described in EXHIBIT H3, and the
          [**] Research Project described in EXHIBIT H4. The Set-Up Fee shall be
          provided to Genaissance within [**] days after the date the written
          description for the Research Project is appended to this Agreement.

     T.   Section 4.4 is hereby amended to read as follows:

                 4.4    HAP TYPING SERVICE FEE. In the event Janssen requests

          determining the genotypes for Polymorphisms and (ii) Genaissance
          building the HAP Markers from such genotypes using its proprietary HAP
          Builder program. The HAP Typing Service Fee shall be provided to
          Genaissance quarterly for only those Polymorphisms genotyped during
          the past quarter, upon receipt of an invoice from Genaissance. Janssen

          at least $[**] for HAP Typing Services (including any additional
          amounts paid at the end of the first year under the previous
          sentence), Janssen agrees to pay Genaissance the difference between
          $[**] and the sum actually paid, which amount may be applied by
          Janssen as a credit towards any fees for HAP Typing Services or

                                        8

          fee of [**] Dollars ($[**]) in recognition of all other licenses

          is used in the prognosis of the response to an Initial Drug Product
          and (b) each Initial Diagnostic Produc[**] for which a license is
          granted to Janssen pursuant to Section 2.1.3 or 2.1.5 hereof and which
          is not used in the prognosis of the response to an Initial Drug
          Product, upon the receipt of the first regulatory approval in any of
          the United States, any Major European Country or Japan (e.g., when a
          milestone is reached first, for example, in the United States, no
          payment is due upon reaching the same milestone in another country for
          the same Initial Diagnostic Product).
