               layoff'  (as  defined  in  the  WARN  Act)  affecting  any of the

          relating  to any portion of the  Purchased  Assets from or required by

     (a)  Covenants of Seller. Seller covenants and agrees as follows:

          (i)  Access and  Information.  Subject to the provisions of the letter
               agreement    between   Buyer   and   Seller   with   respect   to
               confidentiality   dated   on  or   about   May  20,   2002   (the
               "Confidentiality  Agreement") and upon reasonable notice,  Seller
               shall  grant,  or cause to be granted  to,  Buyer  access  during
               normal  business hours  throughout the period between the date of
               this  Agreement and the Closing Date to the Purchased  Assets and
               the  books and  records  and other  information  relating  to the
               operations of the Pipeline Interest.  During this period,  Seller
               shall use all  commercially  reasonable  efforts to  furnish,  or
               cause to be furnished to, Buyer and its  representatives all data
               and information concerning the Purchased Assets and the operation
               of the Pipeline  Interest  (the "Data")  which may  reasonably be
               requested  by Buyer  and shall  use all  commercially  reasonable
               efforts to make available,  or cause to be made  available,  such
               personnel  of  Seller  as may  reasonably  be  requested  for the
               furnishing  of such Data.  During  this  period,  Buyer shall not
               contact  or  communicate  with  any  employees,  customers  of or
               suppliers to the Pipeline Interest without Seller's prior written
               consent,  which  consent  shall  not  be  unreasonably  withheld,
               conditioned or delayed. Buyer shall indemnify and hold Seller and
               its affiliates  harmless against any and all Losses suffered as a
               result of Buyer's or its employees' or agents'  negligent acts or
               omissions  or  intentional  misconduct  in  connection  with  the
               exercise  of  Buyer's   rights  under  this   Section   10(a)(i).
               Notwithstanding  any provision in this Agreement to the contrary,
               Buyer's obligations under this Section 10(a)(i) shall survive the
               termination  of  this  Agreement  and  the  consummation  of  the
               transactions contemplated hereby.

          (ii) Conduct of  Business.  From the date  hereof  through the Closing
               Date, Seller shall: operate the Pipeline Interest in the ordinary
               course  of   business   consistent   with  past   practice;   use
               commercially   reasonable   efforts  to   maintain   satisfactory
               relationships with employees, suppliers, distributors,  customers
               and  others  having  business  relationships  with  the  Pipeline
               Interest;  use  commercially  reasonable  efforts to maintain the
               Purchased Assets in reasonably good operating  condition,  normal
               wear and tear excepted; maintain its inventory of supplies, parts
               and other materials and inventories and keep its books of account
               records  and  files,  in each  case  in the  ordinary  course  of
               business consistent with past practice; refrain from (A) entering
               into,   amending,   modifying,   waiving  any  rights   under  or
               terminating  (or allowing to  terminate)  any Material  Contract,
               other than  allowing  Material  Contracts to expire in accordance
               with  their  terms  in  the  ordinary  course  of  business,  (B)
               disposing of, encumbering,  selling or otherwise transferring any
               of the material  assets  constituting  Purchased  Assets or other
               rights of the Pipeline  Interest,  (C) commencing any new capital
               projects  or  making  any  additional   commitments  for  capital
               expenditures  relating  to the  Pipeline  Interest  in  excess of
               twenty five thousand  dollars  ($25,000.00) in the aggregate,  or
               (D)  granting  or  agreeing  to grant  any bonus or  increase  in
               compensation  to any employees of the Pipeline  Interest,  except
               for those that Buyer  would not be  responsible  for paying or as
               otherwise provided in the Transition Services Agreement, or enter
               into any contract of employment,  collective bargaining agreement
               or other  labor  contract  with  respect  to any such  employees;
               provided that Seller may take any action to which Buyer  consents
               in  advance  and  in  writing   (which   consent   shall  not  be
               unreasonably  withheld  taking  account of Buyer's  and  Seller's
               commercial objectives with respect to the Purchased Assets).

          (iii)Confidentiality.  Seller  recognizes and acknowledges that it has
               knowledge  of  certain  confidential  information  regarding  the
               Purchased Assets and the Pipeline Interest which will be conveyed
               to Buyer at Closing  hereunder.  Seller  agrees  that it will not
               disclose,  and will use reasonable  commercial efforts to prevent
               disclosure to any other Person of such  confidential  information
               except to authorized  representatives of Buyer. Seller recognizes
               and agrees that violation of this provision may cause irreparable
               damage  or injury  to  Buyer,  the  exact  amount of which may be
               impossible  to  ascertain,  and that Buyer may be  entitled to an
               injunction,  without the  necessity  of posting a bond  therefor,
               restraining any further violation of this provision.  Such rights
               to any injunction  shall be in addition to, and not in limitation
               of,  any other  rights  and  remedies  Buyer  may have  vis-a-vis
               Seller;  provided  however,  Seller  shall be permitted to use or
               disclose  any  confidential  information  as  required to operate
               Seller's ongoing business, or as required by law or regulation.

          (iv) Pursuit of Claims  Against Prior Owners.  In the event that Buyer
               incurs  Losses for which no  recovery  is  available  from Seller
               under  the terms of this  Agreement,  but for  which  Seller  has
               legitimate claims for recovery from a prior owner of the Pipeline
               Interest due to breach of warranty or otherwise,  Seller  agrees,
               for a  period  of one  year  from  the  Closing  Date  (i) to use
               commercially  reasonable  efforts  to pursue  all such  claims on
               Buyer's behalf and in consultation  and  cooperation  with Buyer;
               and (ii) that all amounts  recovered from pursuit of such claims,
               less the costs of any suit or other proceeding, attorney fees and
               any and all other  amounts  expended or incurred by Seller or its
               representatives  or  advisors in  connection  with the pursuit of
               such  claims,  shall be paid  over  from  Seller  to  Buyer  upon
               receipt.  It is understood  that pursuit of such claims by Seller
               shall not include any  requirement  of Seller to expend any money
               or  commence  any   litigation,   arbitration   or  other  formal
               proceeding  in  connection  therewith.  Notwithstanding  anything
               contained  herein to the contrary,  Seller shall not be obligated
               to take any action  pursuant to the foregoing and may immediately
               terminate any action so undertaken,  if Seller shall determine in
               its  sole  discretion  that  pursuit  of  any  such  claim  could
               adversely affect either Seller's  business  interests or Seller's
               customer relationships.

          (v)  Removal of Liens and  Encumbrances.  In the event there are liens
               and encumbrances,  other than Permitted Liens, against any of the
               Purchased Assets, Seller shall cause the removal of such liens at
               or  before  Closing,  at its  sole  cost  and  expense.  Seller's
               obligations under this paragraph shall not be subject to Sections
               15(j) through (m).

          (vi) Certain  Information.  Subject to the Confidentiality  Agreement,
               Seller shall use commercially  reasonable efforts to furnish,  at
               Buyer's expense, to Buyer such information,  to the extent Seller
               has such information  available in its corporate records,  as may
               be  necessary  to permit  Buyer to arrange for  financing  of the
               transaction contemplated by this Agreement.

          (vii)Lien  Assistance.  At and  prior to  Closing,  Seller  shall  use
               commercially  reasonable  efforts  to assist and  cooperate  with
               Buyer and its lenders as  reasonably  required to enable  Buyer's
               lenders to place liens and mortgages on the assets to be acquired
               by Buyer from Seller pursuant to this Agreement at Closing.  This
               cooperation  shall  include,   but  not  be  limited  to,  making
               necessary  personnel  reasonably  available  at Seller's  offices
               during  normal  business  hours and  execution  and filing of all
               deeds,  assignments and other instruments necessary to vest title
               to said assets in Buyer at Closing as contemplated herein.

          (viii) Pressure  Matters.  Prior to Closing,  Seller shall  complete a
               pipeline  inspection  tool run, as  contemplated  under 49 C.F.R.
               ss.195.303,  in the segment of the 10"  Pipeline  extending  from
               Medina, ND to Moorhead, ND.

     (b)  Covenants of Buyer. Buyer covenants and agrees as follows:

     (i)  Confidentiality.

          (A)  Buyer acknowledges that all information provided to any of it and
               its  affiliates,   directors,   officers,   employees,   counsel,
               auditors, accountants, agents, advisors and other representatives
               by  Seller  and  its  directors,  officers,  employees,  counsel,
               auditors, accountants, agents, advisors and other representatives
               is subject  to the terms of the  Confidentiality  Agreement,  the
               terms of which  are  hereby  incorporated  herein  by  reference.
               Effective upon, and only upon, the Closing,  the  Confidentiality
               Agreement  shall  terminate  only  with  respect  to  information
               provided to any of Buyer and its affiliates, directors, officers,
               employees, counsel, auditors,  accountants,  agents, advisors and
               other  representatives  that relates  primarily to the  Purchased
               Assets, the Pipeline Interest, or the Assumed Liabilities.

          (B)  Buyer agrees that,  from and after the Closing  Date,  all Seller
               Information shall continue to be confidential information subject
               to the terms,  conditions and restrictions of the Confidentiality
               Agreement.  In connection with the Transferred  Employees,  Buyer
               shall use commercially  reasonable  efforts,  at Seller's request
               and  at  Seller's  expense,   to  cooperate  with  Buyer  in  the
               enforcement  of existing  confidentiality  agreements  and rights
               requiring  employees  to keep  trade  secrets  confidential.  For
               purposes of this Agreement,  "Seller  Information" shall mean all
               information   concerning  Seller,  other  than  information  that
               relates primarily to the Pipeline Interest,  the Purchased Assets
               or the Assumed  Liabilities  and other than any such  information
               that  is  available  to  the  public  on  the  Closing  Date,  or
               thereafter  becomes  available  to the  public,  other  than as a
               result of a breach of this Section 10(b)(i).

          (ii) Notification.  From the date  hereof  through and  including  the
               Closing  Date,  Buyer  shall  promptly  notify  Seller  within  a
               reasonable   period  of  time  if  to  Buyer's   Knowledge,   any
               representation  or  warranty of Seller in this  Agreement  or any
               agreement  contemplated  hereby or  information  set forth in the
               Schedules  hereto  is  not  true  and  correct  in  all  material
               respects,  or if to  Buyer's  Knowledge,  there are any  material
               errors in, or omissions  from,  the Schedules to this  Agreement;
               provided  that any delay or failure by Buyer to so notify  Seller
               shall not in any way affect or limit Buyer's right to assert such
               matters  that were within  Buyer's  Knowledge as a breach of such
               representations  or warranties for purposes of exercising Buyer's
               right to  indemnification  after the Closing  Date,  it being the
               intention  of the  Parties  that any delay or failure by Buyer to
               notify Seller as required by this Section 10(b)(ii) shall operate
               only to limit  Buyer's  right under  Section  12(b) to claim such
               failure  of such  representation  and  warranty  to be  true  and
               correct in all material  respects as a condition to Closing.  For
               purposes of this Agreement,  "Knowledge," when used in the phrase
               "Buyer's  Knowledge"  in this  Agreement  or in  similar  context
               means,  and shall be limited  to, the actual  knowledge  (without
               independent  investigation)  of (i)  Edward  Doherty,  (ii) Jimmy
               Harrison,  (iii) Ron  Scoggins,  (iv) Leroy  Anderson and (v) Lee
               Childres,  and including but not limited to any  replacements  of
               any of the foregoing individuals prior to Closing.

          (iii)Litigation.  With respect to all litigation and other matters set
               forth on the Schedules attached hereto and any other matters that
               constitute  Retained  Liabilities  and for so long as  Seller  is
               contesting or defending such matter, Buyer shall cooperate in all
               reasonable  respects with Seller and its counsel in their efforts
               to  conduct  or  resolve  such  litigation,  including  by making
               available to them at Seller's  sole expense  such  documents  and
               witnesses  as may be  deemed  necessary  or  useful  therefor  in
               Seller's sole but reasonable discretion.

          (iv) Title Policies.  Buyer may procure, and shall pay the cost of the
               premium  for,  commitments  or  policies  from a title  insurance
               company  selected  by Buyer to provide  owner's  title  insurance
               policies  with  respect to the portions of the  Purchased  Assets
               constituting  real  property,  provided,  however,  that  Buyer's
               ability or  inability  to obtain  title  insurance  (and  without
               regard to (i) any exceptions contained therein and (ii) any title
               insurance  premium  Buyer is  required  to pay in order to obtain
               such title insurance) on such real property shall not cause there
               to be an adjustment to the Purchase Price; provided, however, the
               foregoing  shall not be deemed to mitigate  Seller's  obligations
               set forth in Section 10(a)(v).

          (v)  Removal  of  Seller  Marks.   Buyer  agrees  that  it  shall  use
               commercially  reasonable  efforts to, within six (6) months after
               the  Closing  Date,  remove,  obliterate,  cover or  replace,  as
               appropriate,   all   signs,   billboards,    containers,   drums,
               advertisements or other media containing any service marks, trade
               names,  trade dress or other indicia of origin of Seller  located
               on or  appurtenant  to  any of the  Purchased  Assets,  including
               signs,  billboards and  advertisements  or other media located at
               offices  and  facilities  related to the  Pipeline  Interest.  In
               addition,  Buyer agrees that it shall use commercially reasonable
               efforts to, within six (6) months after the Closing Date, replace
               all  signs  located  along  each  Pipeline,  including  at  river
               crossings, that identify Seller as the operator of such Pipeline.

     (c)  Mutual Covenants. Buyer and Seller covenant and agree as follows:

          (i)  HSR Act/State Regulatory  Approvals.  Buyer and Seller shall each
               file or cause to be filed with the Federal Trade  Commission  and
               the  United  States   Department  of  Justice  any  notifications
               required  to be filed  under  the HSR Act,  with  respect  to the
               transactions contemplated hereby, and Buyer and Seller shall bear
               the costs and expenses of their respective filings; provided that
               Buyer  and  Seller  shall  each  pay  50%  of the  filing  fee in
               connection therewith. Buyer and Seller shall use their respective
               commercially  reasonable  efforts to make such  filings  promptly
               (and in any  event  within  seven (7)  days)  following  the date
               hereof,  to  respond  promptly  to any  requests  for  additional
               information  and  documentary  materials  made by  either of such
               agencies or any state regulatory authorities, to make any further
               filings that may be necessary,  proper or advisable in connection
               therewith,  to cause  the  waiting  periods  under the HSR Act to
               terminate or expire at the earliest  possible  date and to resist
               in good  faith,  at each of their  respective  cost  and  expense
               (including the institution or defense of legal proceedings),  any
               assertion that the transactions  contemplated hereby constitute a
               violation  of the  antitrust  laws or are  adverse  to the public
               interest,  all  to  the  end of  expediting  consummation  of the
               transactions contemplated hereby. Each of Buyer, on the one hand,
               and Seller,  on the other,  shall consult with the other prior to
               any  meetings,  by telephone or in person,  with the staff of the
               applicable governmental authorities, and each of Buyer and Seller
               shall have the right to have a representative present at any such
               meeting.  Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary herein,  this
               paragraph shall not obligate Buyer to (A) divest or hold separate
               any asset, (B) enter into any material agreement not contemplated
               by this Agreement, or (C) materially modify this Agreement.

          (ii) Assignments.

               (A)  (I) With respect to any agreement, contract, license, lease,
                    easement,  right-of-way  or  Permit  which  (1)  is  not  an
                    Excluded  Asset,  (2) is  material to the  operation  of the
                    Pipeline  Interest as it is currently  and has been operated
                    by Seller during the  immediately  preceding five (5) months
                    and (3)  requires  consent  for the  assignment  thereof  to
                    Buyer, Seller shall take such actions as are necessary,  and
                    Buyer shall cooperate fully with Seller in all  commercially
                    reasonable  respects,  to effect assignment thereof to Buyer
                    as of the Closing Date.  It is understood  that such actions
                    by Seller  shall not  include any  requirement  of Seller to
                    commence any litigation or offer or grant any  accommodation
                    (financial  or  otherwise)  to any third  party,  but Seller
                    shall be required to expend money in  connection  therewith;
                    provided,  however,  that Buyer  shall be  obligated  to pay
                    Seller any railroad  application  fees  required to transfer
                    the rights of way,  up to a maximum  of sixty five  thousand
                    dollars  ($65,000).  In the event  that  Seller is unable to
                    obtain the  requisite  approval for  assignment  of any such
                    agreement, contract, license, lease, easement,  right-of-way
                    or  Permit,  or  in  the  event  such  agreement,  contract,
                    license, lease, easement, right-of-way or Permit is required
                    to be  amended  or  supplemented  and is not so  amended  or
                    supplemented  as of the Closing Date, and such assignment is
                    reasonably   necessary  to  conduct  the  operation  of  the
                    Pipeline Interest in the ordinary course of business,  then,
                    on or before the Closing  Date and except  where such action
                    would be unlawful or prohibited by such agreement, contract,
                    license,  lease,  easement,  right-of-way or Permit,  Seller
                    shall (x)  retain  any such  agreement,  contract,  license,
                    lease, easement, right-of-way or Permit and shall enter into
                    an arrangement with Buyer to provide Buyer with the benefits
                    of  such  agreement,  contract,  license,  lease,  easement,
                    right-of-way or Permit,  provided,  that Buyer shall perform
                    Seller's  obligations  thereunder  arising after the Closing
                    (and indemnify  Seller against Losses arising as a result of
                    Buyer  causing  a  breach  thereunder  or Buyer  failing  to
                    perform Seller's  obligations  thereunder after the Closing)
                    until such agreement,  contract,  license,  lease, easement,
                    right-of-way  or Permit is  assigned  to Buyer or expires at
                    the earliest opportunity in accordance with its terms, or is
                    properly   amended  or   supplemented,   and  (y)  take  all
                    commercially  reasonable and necessary  actions  required to
                    assign to Buyer,  or amend or supplement any such agreement,
                    contract,  license, lease, easement,  right-of-way or Permit
                    as soon as practicable after the Closing Date; and

               (II) In  addition  to the  obligations  of Seller  under  Section
                    10(c)(ii)(A)(I) above, Seller shall take such actions as are
                    necessary,  including  expending  money,  and  Seller  shall
                    cooperate  fully with Buyer in all  commercially  reasonable
                    respects,  to  remedy  the  matters  set  forth on  Schedule
                    10(c)(ii)(A)(II).

          (B)  Notwithstanding   Seller's   obligations   pursuant   to  Section
               10(c)(ii)(A), the assignment of any agreement, contract, license,
               lease,  easement,  right of way or  Permit to be  transferred  to
               Buyer which  requires  consent for  assignment,  or  amendment or
               supplement,  may be effected after the Closing Date. The Purchase
               Price shall not be subject to adjustment,  and the Closing of the
               transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall not be delayed,
               by reason of any  inability to obtain  consent for  assignment of
               any agreement,  contract,  license, lease, easement, right of way
               or Permit or any such amendment or supplement.  Buyer agrees that
               except as provided in Section  15(b)(iii),  Seller shall not have
               any  liability  whatsoever to Buyer arising out of or relating to
               the failure to obtain any such consents that may have been or may
               be required in connection with the  transactions  contemplated by
               this  Agreement  or  because  of  the  default,  acceleration  or
               termination  of any such  agreement,  contract,  license,  lease,
               easement,  right of way or Permit as a result  thereof  (provided
               that Seller has complied with its obligations  under this Section
               10(c)(ii)). Buyer further agrees that no representation, warranty
               or  covenant  of Seller  contained  herein,  shall be breached or
               deemed  breached and no condition of Buyer shall be deemed not to
               be  satisfied  as a result  of the  failure  to  obtain  any such
               consent  or as a result  of any  such  default,  acceleration  or
               termination  or  any  lawsuit,   action,  claim,   proceeding  or
               investigation  commenced  or  threatened  by or on  behalf of any
               Persons  arising  out of or relating to the failure to obtain any
               such consent or any such  default,  acceleration  or  termination
               (provided  that Seller has complied  with its  obligations  under
               this Section 10(c)(ii)).

          (iii)Other  Governmental  Approvals.  Buyer and Seller shall cooperate
               with each other and take all reasonable steps necessary to obtain
               authorization  for the  sale of the  Pipeline  Interest  from all
               other applicable governmental authorities.

          (iv) Other  Actions.  Buyer  and  Seller  shall  otherwise  use  their
               respective   commercially   reasonable   efforts   to  cause  the
               satisfaction  of all conditions  precedent in this Section 10 and
               Sections 12 and 13 and the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably
               practicable after the date of this Agreement.

          (v)  Pipeline  Capacity Lease. At the Closing,  Buyer and Seller shall
               execute and deliver a Capacity Lease substantially in the form of
               Exhibit  F under  which  Buyer  will  lease  to  Seller  capacity
               post-Closing in the Buyer's pipeline  intersecting the Pipelines,
               between  Mandan,  North  Dakota and certain  terminals on Buyer's
               Iowa/Dakota pipeline system.

          (vi) Jamestown  Terminal  Capacity  Lease.  At the Closing,  Buyer and
               Seller shall execute and deliver a Capacity  Lease  substantially
               in the form of Exhibit K under  which  Buyer will lease to Seller
               capacity  post-Closing  in the Jamestown,  North Dakota  terminal
               being purchased by Buyer under this Agreement.

          (vii)Other Agreements.  At the Closing, Buyer and Seller shall execute
               and deliver  each of the  agreements  substantially  in the forms
               attached  hereto as  Exhibits  and,  with  respect to  agreements
               contemplated  in  Section  5(b)(ii)  and  Section  5(d)  but  not
               attached hereto as Exhibits,  the parties shall negotiate in good
               faith and enter into such agreements at Closing.

          (viii) Environmental Access Agreement.  The parties shall negotiate in
               good  faith  and  enter  into an  environmental  agreement  to be
               executed at Closing (the "Environmental  Access Agreement").  The
               Environmental   Access  Agreement  shall  include,  or  otherwise
               provide, at a minimum, (i) for Seller's reasonable management and
               control  of  the  remediation  of  the  Disclosed   Environmental
               Liabilities, (ii) for Seller's necessary and reasonable access to
               the Purchased  Assets after Closing,  and (iii)for the expiration
               of  the   Environmental   Access  Agreement  as  to  a  Disclosed
               Environmental   Liability  upon  remediation  of  that  Disclosed
               Environmental Liability to a remediation clean-up standard and in
               a time frame no more  stringent  than required by the  government
               agencies  with  jurisdiction  over  the  Disclosed  Environmental
               Liabilities (as  demonstrated by receipt of a closure letter from
               the applicable  governmental  agency(ies) or demonstration of the
               clean-up  standard being  satisfied for a one-year period after a
               good faith request for closure is requested);  provided  however,
               that neither (A) the  Environmental  Access Agreement nor (B) any
               closure letter or demonstration of any clean-up standard, whether
               as  contemplated  by the  parenthetical  in clause  (iii) of this
               sentence or otherwise,  shall reduce or limit the  obligations of
               Seller  with  respect  to, or cause a  termination  of,  Seller's
               Environmental  Liabilities  provided  in Section  4(c)(iii),  nor
               shall it reduce or limit the  obligations  of Buyer with  respect
               to, or cause a termination of, Buyer's Environmental  Liabilities
               provided  in Section  4(c)(iv),  nor shall it affect any  Party's
               rights or obligations under Section 15.

          (ix) Casualty Loss.

               (A)  If, between the Effective  Date and the Closing Date,  there
                    shall  have  occurred  any  damage,   destruction  or  other
                    casualty  losses  (excluding   routine  wear  and  tear)  (a
                    "Casualty")  with respect to the  Purchased  Assets,  Seller
                    shall  promptly  notify  Buyer  of the  occurrence  of  such
                    Casualty,  providing full details about the nature, location
                    and  projected  effect of such  Casualty,  the equipment and
                    facilities affected thereby and the expected duration of the
                    Casualty,  together with the anticipated costs of repair and
                    the projected  time until  repairs can be completed,  and an
                    itemization  of repairs  required to return  such  Purchased
                    Assets  to their  condition  prior to such  Casualty.  Buyer
                    shall  have the right to audit,  inspect  and  evaluate  the
                    Casualty and Seller's  projections of necessary repairs.  If
                    Buyer, in its reasonable commercial judgment determines that
                    such Casualty,  or all Casualties combined, if more than one
                    has been  identified,  will cause an Adverse Economic Effect
                    upon the Purchased Assets,  taken as a whole, as intended to
                    be  operated  by  Buyer  after  Closing,  then  Buyer  shall
                    promptly  notify  Seller  accordingly,  within  15  days  of
                    Buyer's receipt of notice of a Casualty,  stating the amount
                    of Buyer's  projected  Adverse Economic Effect and providing
                    documentation     and    calculations     supporting    such
                    determination.   For  purposes  hereof,   "Adverse  Economic
                    Effect"  means the sum of (x) the  projected  loss of tariff
                    revenues resulting from the Casualty, based upon a projected
                    reduction in  throughput,  plus (y) projected  reductions in
                    lease  payments  resulting  from the Casualty  owed to Buyer
                    under the  Pipeline  Capacity  Lease and  Terminal  Capacity
                    Lease as set forth in Exhibit F and Exhibit K, respectively,
                    less (z) Buyer's savings in power costs,  resulting from the
                    Casualty.

               (B)  If the  Adverse  Economic  Effect  is  determined  to be two
                    hundred fifty thousand  dollars  ($250,000) or less,  Seller
                    may (i) after  providing  two days prior  written  notice to
                    Buyer  of  its  intent  to do so,  elect  to  terminate  the
                    Agreement  pursuant to Section  18(a)(vi),  or (ii) elect to
                    repair all damage to the  Purchased  Assets at its sole cost
                    and expense in which event  Buyer's  obligation to close the
                    transactions contemplated hereunder will not be affected. If
                    such repairs are not  completed by the Closing  Date,  Buyer
                    shall  proceed  to  close  the   transactions   contemplated
                    hereunder, and Seller shall complete such repairs as quickly
                    as reasonably  practicable  after Closing in accordance with
                    all applicable industry,  legal and regulatory standards, in
                    which case  Seller  shall pay Buyer a Delay Fee for each day
                    during the  Period,  which  begins on the  Closing  Date and
                    continues  until the date repairs are completed (the "Repair
                    Period").  The Delay Fee shall be equal to the  reduction in
                    Buyer's  anticipated  revenue from operation of the Pipeline
                    Interest,  which  shall  be  calculated  as  the  difference
                    between  (I) the revenue  Buyer  would have  received if all
                    portions of the  Pipeline  Interest  were  operated at their
                    respective  average throughput volumes during the sixty (60)
                    day  period  immediately  prior  to  the  occurrence  of the
                    Casualty, minus (II) the revenue Buyer actually receives for
                    shipment of  Petroleum  Products  during each day during the
                    Repair Period.  Seller's  indemnification  obligations under
                    Section 15 for its breach of this  Section  10(c)(ix)  shall
                    not be  subject  to the  deductibles  or cap  set  forth  in
                    Section 15(j) or Section 15(k).

               (C)  If the Adverse  Economic  Effect is determined to be greater
                    than two hundred fifty thousand dollars  ($250,000),  Seller
                    may (i) after  providing  two days prior  written  notice to
                    Buyer  of  its  intent  to do so,  elect  to  terminate  the
                    Agreement  pursuant to Section  18(a)(vi),  or (ii) elect to
                    request Fluor  Corporation to evaluate the Purchased  Assets
                    and deliver to Buyer and Seller its written  estimate of the
                    Adverse  Economic  Effect plus the cost to repair all damage
                    to the Purchased Assets ("Third Party  Estimate")  within 30
                    days of being  requested  to do so by  Seller.  If the Third
                    Party  Estimate is greater than two hundred  fifty  thousand
                    dollars  ($250,000),  the Parties  shall  negotiate  in good
                    faith to attempt to agree upon a Purchase Price reduction to
                    compensate  Buyer for the  Adverse  Economic  Effect and the
                    cost to repair the damage to the Purchased  Assets caused by
                    the Casualty. If the Parties cannot agree upon the amount of
                    such Purchase Price reduction within ten (10) days after the
                    issuance of the Third  Party  Estimate,  either  Party shall
                    have the  right,  after  providing  two days  prior  written
                    notice  to the  other  party  of  its  intent  to do so,  to
                    terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section  18(a)(vi).  In
                    the event that Seller exercises its rights to terminate this
                    Agreement  under  Section  10(c)(ix)(B)  or (C) , Buyer  may
                    provide  written  notice  to  Seller  within  three  days of
                    receipt of Seller's notice to terminate of Buyer's desire to
                    waive any and all  obligation of Seller with respect to such
                    Casualty,  in which event (x) the Parties  shall  proceed to
                    Closing,  (y) Seller  shall have no  obligation  to make any
                    repairs to the damaged  Purchased  Assets and there shall be
                    no Purchase  Price  reduction,  and (z) the Casualty  giving
                    rise to the Adverse  Economic  Effect shall be deemed not to
                    breach any  representation or warranty or covenant and Buyer
                    shall not have any right to receive indemnification or other
                    compensation hereunder with respect thereto.

               (D)  In the  event  that  any  Casualty  occurring  prior  to the
                    Closing (regardless of the amount of the associated Casualty
                    Loss) has been  repaired in full prior to the  Closing,  the
                    foregoing  provisions  shall not apply and the parties shall
                    proceed  to  Closing  as if such  Casualty  had never  taken
                    place.

               (E)  Notwithstanding  anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
                    in the event a Casualty  occurs prior to the  Closing,  this
                    Section shall exclusively govern any termination rights that
                    may exist as a result  of such  Casualty  and such  Casualty
                    shall  not  have any  effect  on  Seller's  representations,
                    warranties  or covenants set forth herein or cause a failure
                    of Buyer's conditions to close as set forth in Section 12 to
                    be satisfied.

          (x)  Product  Inventory.  At Closing,  Buyer will take  custody of all
               petroleum  products   inventories   contained  in  the  Pipelines
               linefill  and  Terminals  linefill  and  tankage,  and  including
               without  limitation,  additives  (the "Product  Inventory").  The
               volume  of  such  Product   Inventory   shall  be  determined  in
               accordance with an Inventory Closing Procedure attached hereto as
               Exhibit L.

          (xi) Name Change. Prior to Closing, Seller shall file all certificates
               and other documentation required to legally reflect the change in
               name of Seller from Tesoro West Coast Company to Tesoro  Refining
               and Marketing Company in all real property records related to the
               Pipeline Agreement or the real property included in the Purchased
               Assets.

     11. EMPLOYEES.

     (a)  Employees.  Schedule  11(a)  attached  hereto  contains  a list of all
          employees (collectively,  the "Employees") of Seller directly employed
          in the  operation  of the  Pipeline  Interest,  save and except  those
          employed in operation  of the control  room for the  Pipeline  System,
          including employees who are receiving  short-term  disability benefits
          or are on family and medical, administrative, or military leave or any
          other type of leave that entitles the Employee to  reinstatement  upon
          completion of the leave under the applicable  leave policies of Seller
          (collectively,  "Leave").  Seller shall be entitled to update Schedule
          11(a) as necessary at any time prior to Closing to reflect any and all
          employment  changes.  Any  reference to Buyer in this Section 11 shall
          refer to Buyer and its  affiliates.  (b)  Employment  Offers to Active
          Employees.  During the fifteen (15) day period following the Effective
          Date,  Buyer  shall  offer to  active  Employees  who are not on Leave
          employment  with Buyer to be effective as of the Closing Date,  and to
          Employees  on  short-term  disability,  employment  with  Buyer  to be
          effective  upon the later of the Closing Date or each such  Employee's
          respective  medical  clearance  to  return  to  work,  for  all of the
          Employees  associated  with the  Pipeline  Interest  (not to exceed 26
          employees),  at substantially  similar salaries or wages, with similar
          duties  and  responsibilities,  at the same  location  and on the same
          status   (e.g.,   full-time  or   part-time)  as  provided  by  Seller
          immediately  prior to the  Closing  Date.  All  Employees  who  accept
          employment with Buyer pursuant to the offers described in this Section
          11(b) are referred to herein as "Transferred  Employees."  Buyer shall
          not reduce any  Transferred  Employee's  initial salary or wages as an
          employee of Buyer  during the six (6) month  period  after the Closing
          Date.  Buyer  will  give  each  active  Employee  to  whom  it  offers
          employment  no less  than  seven (7) days in which to accept or reject
          Buyer's employment offer.  Notwithstanding  anything in this Agreement
          to the contrary, Seller will not provide to Buyer any medical or other
          records  related  to  Transferred  Employees  until  such  time as any
          consents  required by law or  regulation  have been received from such
          employees to transfer same.

     (c)  Transfer Time. All  Transferred  Employees  shall become  employees of
          Buyer as of Closing and except as otherwise  provided herein,  at such
          time,  Buyer  shall  assume  and be  responsible  for  payment  of all
          salaries and benefits and all other costs and liabilities  relating to
          the Transferred Employees incurred from and after Closing.

     (d)  Level of  Employee  Benefits  Provided by Buyer.  Except as  otherwise
          provided  herein,  Buyer shall  provide to all  Transferred  Employees
          employee  benefits in accordance with employee  benefit plans (such as
          defined  contribution  plans and  welfare  benefit  plans),  programs,
          policies and pay practices (such as vacations,  bonuses and short-term
          disability  leaves) that shall be the same as the benefits provided to
          substantially  similar  employees of Buyer.  No later than the Closing
          Date,  Seller  will  provide  to  Buyer  the  Transferred   Employees'
          recognized  credited  service,  and  participation,  vesting  and,  as
          applicable, benefit accrual periods of service amounts, with Seller as
          of the day immediately prior to the Closing Date.

     (e)  Defined Contribution Pension Plans. Buyer agrees that, effective as of
          the Closing Date, Buyer's defined  contribution pension plans in which
          Transferred  Employees  participate shall be amended to recognize such
          Transferred  Employees'  participation  and vesting periods of service
          with or credited by Seller for purposes of determining  participation,
          vesting and the level of company contributions.

     (f)  Welfare Benefits and Other Benefits and Policies. For each Transferred
          Employee who  participates  in any welfare benefit plan, or is subject
          to any policy or pay practice, of Buyer, both Buyer and the applicable
          welfare benefit, policy and pay practice shall:

          (i)  not   require  a   physical   examination   or  other   proof  of
               insurability; and

          (ii) subject to the  satisfaction of the conditions  described in this
               Section  11(f)(ii) on the Closing Date,  waive  waiting  periods,
               pre-existing condition exclusions, deductibles (for the remainder
               of  2002)  and  other  limitations  on  participation   otherwise
               applicable to any Transferred  Employee and qualified  dependents
               (who were covered by an employee  welfare  benefit plan of Seller
               or its  affiliates  and  immediately  elects to be  covered by an
               employee  welfare benefit plan of Buyer) under or with respect to
               all employee  welfare  benefit  plans  maintained  by Buyer.  The
               conditions  for the waivers  described in this Section  11(f)(ii)
               are:

               (A)  Buyer will waive waiting  periods to the extent service with
                    Seller would  otherwise  satisfy the waiting  period and the
                    Transferred  Employee  is  actively  at work;  for Long Term
                    Disability   Insurance,   the  waiver  is  contingent   upon
                    receiving a waiver from Buyer's insurance carrier;

               (B)  Buyer will waive  pre-existing  condition  exclusions to the
                    extent a Certificate of Creditable  Coverage is presented by
                    and for the Transferred  Employee and all dependents showing
                    coverage for the eighteen (18) months  immediately  prior to
                    coverage under Buyer's plan; and

               (C)  Buyer will offset (waive or partially waive)  deductibles to
                    the extent  the  Transferred  Employee  or  dependent  shows
                    reasonable   evidence  of  satisfaction  of  the  applicable
                    deductible with Seller during the same calendar year.

     (g)  Vacation. Seller shall be responsible for paying the Employees for any
          vacation  due as of the  Closing  Date under the  applicable  vacation
          policy of  Seller.  Subject  to Buyer's  vacation  scheduling  policy,
          between the Closing  Date and the end of the year in which the Closing
          occurs,  Buyer shall permit all Transferred  Employees to schedule and
          take the same number of days of  vacation  on an unpaid  basis as they
          had scheduled and would have been eligible to take  immediately  prior
          to the Closing Date under the Seller's  Vacation Policy based upon the
          recognized credited service amounts of such Transferred Employees with
          Seller.  All Transferred  Employees will be eligible for paid vacation
          under Buyer's  vacation policy  beginning  January 1, 2003, based upon
          their recognized transferred service.

     (h)  Severance.  Buyer shall  establish a  severance  policy  substantially
          similar  to the 2002  Tesoro  Special  Severance  Plan/Pipelines  (the
          "Severance  Plan"),  with respect to any Transferred  Employee who has
          actions  taken  against such  Transferred  Employee  prior to March 7,
          2003, that would make the Transferred  Employee eligible for severance
          benefits under the involuntary  terminations  section of the Severance
          Plan.  Buyer's  severance policy  established under this Section 11(h)
          shall recognize the Transferred Employees' recognized credited service
          amounts with Seller.

     (i)  WARN Act. Buyer represents and warrants to, and covenants with, Seller
          that there will be no major employment  losses as a consequence of the
          transactions   contemplated  by  this  Agreement  that  might  trigger
          obligations  under the Worker  Adjustment and Retraining  Notification
          Act, 29 U.S.C.  Section 2101 et. seq.  (the "WARN Act"),  or under any
          similar provision of any federal,  state,  regional,  foreign or local
          law, rule or regulation  (collectively,  "WARN  Obligations").  To the
          extent that any WARN  Obligations  might arise as a consequence of the
          transactions   contemplated   by  this   Agreement,   Buyer  shall  be
          responsible  for, and shall indemnify the Seller  Indemnified  Parties
          against any Losses  caused by,  arising  from,  incurred in connection
          with or  relating  in any way to,  any WARN  Obligations  arising as a
          result of any  employment  losses  occurring  on or after the  Closing
          Date. For ninety (90) days following the Closing Date, Buyer shall not
          engage in any mass  layoff,  plant  closing or other action that might
          trigger WARN Obligations of Seller.

     (j)  Service  Credit.  From and after the  Closing  Date,  the  Transferred
          Employees shall be given credit for their service recognized by Seller
          prior to the Closing  Date for all  purposes,  including  eligibility,
          vesting and benefit  determination  and accrual  under all  applicable
          plans and programs of Buyer,  as well as for  purposes of  determining
          any  vacation,  severance  or other  related  benefits  to be provided
          pursuant to the manner described above.

     (k)  Benefits Miscellaneous. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall not
          be  liable  for  any  obligations  arising  out  of  participation  by
          Transferred Employees in the employee benefit plans of Seller.

     12.  BUYER'S  OBLIGATION TO CLOSE.  Buyer's  obligation to close under this
Agreement is subject to the  fulfillment on or prior to the Closing Date of each
of the  following  conditions  (except  to the  extent  that  Buyer  shall  have
hereafter agreed in writing to waive one or more of such conditions).

     (a)  Compliance with Agreement. Seller shall have performed and complied in
          all material  respects with all  covenants,  agreements and conditions
          required by this  Agreement to be performed or complied with by Seller
          prior to the Closing Date,  and Seller shall have delivered to Buyer a
          certificate executed by Seller to such effect.

     (b)  Representations and Warranties.  The representations and warranties of
          Seller  made in  this  Agreement  shall  be true  and  correct  in all
          material  respects  as of the date hereof and on and as of the Closing
          Date, as though made on and as of the Closing  Date,  and Seller shall
          have  delivered  to Buyer a  certificate  executed  by  Seller to such
          effect;  provided,  however,  that  breaches or  inaccuracies  in such
          representations  and warranties  shall not result in a failure of this
          condition to be satisfied unless the circumstances  giving rise to all
          such breaches or inaccuracies (considered collectively) are reasonably
          expected to have an adverse  effect on the Purchased  Assets in excess
          of one million dollars ($1,000,000).  The foregoing is not intended in
          any way to  mitigate  Seller's  indemnity  obligations  in  Section 15
          resulting from any such breaches or inaccuracies.

     (c)  Litigation.  There  shall  not be any  judicial  restraining  order or
          injunction,  preliminary  or  otherwise,  in  effect  prohibiting  the
          Closing of the  transactions  contemplated  by this  Agreement.  There
          shall not be  pending  or  threatened  any  litigation  or  proceeding
          instituted  by any federal,  state or foreign  governmental  agency to
          restrain,  prohibit or otherwise  interfere with or obtain substantial
          monetary   damages  in  connection   with  the   consummation  of  the
          transactions  contemplated  by this  Agreement,  or  operation  of the
          Pipeline Interest by Buyer after the Closing Date.

     (d)  Governmental Consents. All legal requirements under the HSR Act or any
          equivalent  state law for the valid  occurrence of Closing  (including
          the  expiration  or  termination  of any  applicable  waiting  periods
          without a material condition) shall have been fulfilled.

     (e)  Material Adverse Change.  Except for any Casualty Loss that is covered
          by the provision of Section  10(c)(ix),  there shall not have occurred
          any material adverse changes to the Pipeline Interest or the Purchased
          Assets or the business conducted  therewith,  which, in the aggregate,
          are  reasonably  expected to have an adverse  effect upon the Pipeline
          Interest,  the  Purchased  Assets or the  business to be  conducted by
          Buyer therewith in excess of an aggregate of $1,000,000.

     (f)  No  Financing  Contingency.  Buyer's  obligation  to close  under this
          Agreement is subject to any financing contingency.

     13. SELLER'S  OBLIGATION TO CLOSE.  Seller's obligation to close under this
Agreement is subject to the  fulfillment on or prior to the Closing Date of each

hereafter agreed in writing to waive one or more of such conditions).

     (a)  Compliance with Agreement.  Buyer shall have performed and complied in
          all material  respects with all  covenants,  agreements and conditions
          required by this  Agreement to be performed or complied  with by Buyer
          prior to the Closing Date,  and Buyer shall have delivered to Seller a
          certificate executed by Buyer to such effect;

     (b)  Representations and Warranties.  The representations and warranties of
          Buyer made in this Agreement shall be true and correct in all material
          respects as of the date hereof and on and as of the Closing  Date,  as
          though  made on and as of the  Closing  Date,  and  Buyer  shall  have
          delivered to Seller a certificate executed by Buyer to such effect;

     (c)  Litigation.  There  shall  not be any  judicial  restraining  order or
          injunction,  preliminary  or  otherwise,  in  effect  prohibiting  the
          Closing of the  transactions  contemplated  by this  Agreement.  There
          shall not be  pending  or  threatened  any  litigation  or  proceeding
          instituted  by any federal,  state or foreign  governmental  agency to
          restrain,  prohibit or otherwise  interfere with or obtain substantial
          monetary   damages  in  connection   with  the   consummation  of  the
          transactions  contemplated by this Agreement,  or the operation of the
          Pipeline Interest by Buyer after the Closing Date.

     (d)  Governmental Consents. All legal requirements under the HSR Act or any
          equivalent  state law for the valid  occurrence of Closing  (including
          the  expiration  or  termination  of any  applicable  waiting  periods
          without a material condition) shall have been fulfilled.

     14. FURTHER ASSURANCES.  To the extent title to any of the Purchased Assets
is held by any affiliate of Seller,  Seller shall cause title to such  Purchased
Assets to be vested in Seller prior to Closing.  From time to time,  as and when
reasonably  requested  by any party  hereto,  the other party shall  execute and
deliver,  or  cause  to be  executed  and  delivered,  all  such  documents  and
instruments  and shall  take,  or cause to be taken,  all such  further or other
actions  (subject  to the  limitations  set forth in Section  10(c)(ii)),  which
documents,  instruments  or actions  are  consistent  with,  and  customary  and
necessary  for,  the  consummation  of the  transactions  contemplated  by  this
Agreement.

               Terminal  Real  Property,  and  the  operation  of  the  Pipeline
               Interest after the Closing, including those Losses arising under,
               any foreign, federal, state or local laws or regulations,  or any
               contract, warranty, tort or other theory of law;

          (ii) (A)  Buyer's  breach of or  failure to perform  any  covenant  or

               that such  defect or  failure  must be  identified  in writing by
               notice  from Kaneb to Tesoro  within  one year after the  Closing

          (iv) (A)  Seller's  breach of or failure to perform  any  covenant  or
               agreement in this Agreement or the documents  contemplated hereby
               or  executed in  connection  herewith  (other  than the  Excluded
               Agreements);  or (B)  Seller's  breach of any  representation  or
               warranty  under  this  Agreement  or the  documents  contemplated
               hereby  or  executed  in  connection  herewith  (other  than  the
               Excluded Agreements); or

          (v)  any failure by Seller to comply with the  provisions,  if any, of
               state or local bulk sales laws;

     (c)  Environmental  Indemnifications.  Buyer and Seller  shall  provide the
          environmental   indemnifications  specified  below  for  Environmental
          Liabilities:

          (i)  Seller shall indemnify,  defend, save and hold harmless the Buyer
               Indemnified  Parties  from and  against any and all Losses of any
               kind which  are,  or which  related  to or arise  out,  of Seller
               Environmental Liabilities; and

          (ii) Buyer  shall  assume  responsibility  for,  and shall  indemnify,
               defend,  save and hold  harmless the Seller  Indemnified  Parties
               from and against any and all Losses of any kind which (A) are, or
               relate to or arise out of, Buyer  Environmental  Liabilities,  or
               (B) result from changes in,  modifications  to or  amendments  of
               Health,  Safety and Environmental  Laws that were in effect prior
               to the  Closing  Date or Health,  Safety and  Environmental  Laws
               promulgated, made or enacted on or after the Closing Date.

     (d)  Exclusive  Remedy.  Except  for  matters  arising  out of any fraud or
          willful  misconduct (which are not subject to this Section 15(d)), any
          claim or cause of action  based on,  arising out of or relating in any
          way to  any of the  transactions  contemplated  under  this  Agreement
          (excluding the  Environmental  Access Agreement and the agreements and
          documents  described  in  Exhibits A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, J, K, and L
          (collectively  the  "Excluded  Agreements"),  which are not subject to
          this Section  15(d),  but including  all other  Exhibits and Schedules
          attached hereto or referenced  herein) must be brought by either party
          in accordance  with the provisions and  limitations of this Agreement,
          whether  such claim  arises out of any  contract,  tort or  otherwise.
          Except as otherwise  provided in this Agreement and if Closing occurs,
          the  parties  hereby  waive  to the  fullest  extent  permitted  under
          applicable  law, any and all rights,  claims and causes of action they
          may have  against  each other  relating to the subject  matter of this
          Agreement and the other  agreements  contemplated  hereby  (except the
          Excluded  Agreements,  which are not subject to this  Section  15(d)),
          arising  under or based on any federal,  state,  provincial,  local or
          foreign  statute,  law,  ordinance,  rule or  regulation or otherwise,
          including  such  rights,  claims and  causes of action  Buyer may have
          against  Seller  under  CERCLA,   breaches  of  statutory  or  implied
          warranties  or otherwise,  nuisance or other tort actions,  and common
          law rights of  contribution.  Without  limiting the  generality of the
          foregoing,  the parties hereto understand and agree that after Closing
          occurs the  rights  accorded  under  this  Section 15 are the sole and
          exclusive remedies  ---------- of such parties against the other party
          hereto with respect to any matters  relating to this Agreement  (other
          than matters arising out of any fraud or willful  misconduct or out of
          the Excluded Agreements),  including but not limited to Health, Safety
          and Environmental  Laws.  Except as provided in this Agreement,  Buyer
          hereby waives any right to seek  contribution  or other  recovery from
          Seller  under such  Health,  Safety and  Environmental  Laws.  For the
          avoidance  of  doubt,  the  parties  acknowledge  that  they  may seek
          remedies  for  breach of the  Excluded  Agreements  under the terms of
          those  Excluded  Agreements  and under common or statutory law without
          regard to the provisions of this Agreement, provided however, that the
          Excluded  Agreements,  other  than deeds and  assignments,  shall each
          expressly exclude liability for punitive or exemplary damages.

     (e)  Procedures  Relating  to  Indemnification  between  Buyer and  Seller.
          Following  the  discovery  of any  facts  or  conditions  which  could
          reasonably  be  expected  to give rise to a Loss or  Losses  for which
          indemnification  is provided under this  Agreement,  the party seeking
          indemnification  (the  "Indemnified  Party")  shall,  as  promptly  as
          reasonably    possible    thereafter,     provide    written    notice
          ("Indemnification  Notice") to the party from whom  indemnification is
          sought (the  "Indemnifying  Party"),  setting forth the specific facts
          and  circumstances,  in  reasonable  detail,  relating to such Loss or
          Losses and the amount of Loss or Losses (or a  reasonable,  good-faith
          estimate  thereof if the actual  amount is not known or not capable of
          reasonable calculation);  provided, however, that failure to give such
          Indemnification  Notice  on  a  timely  basis  shall  not  affect  the
          indemnification   provided   hereunder   except  to  the   extent  the
          Indemnifying Party shall have been actually and materially  prejudiced
          as a result of such failure.

     (f)  Procedures Relating to Indemnification for Third Party Claims.

          (i)  After providing an Indemnification  Notice in respect of, arising
               out of or involving a claim or demand made by any Person  against
               the  Indemnified  Party (a "Third Party Claim"),  the Indemnified
               Party shall deliver to the  Indemnifying  Party,  within ten (10)
               business  days after the  Indemnified  Party's  receipt  thereof,
               copies of all  notices and  documents  (including  court  papers)
               received  by the  Indemnified  Party  relating to the Third Party
               Claim;   provided,   however,   that   failure   to   provide  an
               Indemnification  Notice  or  deliver  copies of all  notices  and
               documents on a timely manner shall not affect the indemnification
               provided  hereunder except to the extent the  Indemnifying  Party
               shall have been actually prejudiced as a result of such failure.

          (ii) If a Third Party Claim is made against an Indemnified  Party, the
               Indemnifying  Party  shall  be  entitled  to  participate  in the
               defense  thereof  and,  if it so  chooses  and  acknowledges  its
               obligation  to indemnify  the  Indemnified  Party  therefore,  to
               assume (so long as it thereafter  reasonably pursues) the defense
               thereof  with  counsel  selected  by the  Indemnifying  Party and
               reasonably   satisfactory  to  the  Indemnified   Party.  If  the
               Indemnifying  Party  acknowledges its obligation to indemnify the
               Indemnified   Party,  the  Indemnifying  Party  shall  thereafter
               continue to reasonably defend and/or settle the Third Party Claim
               until  final   resolution  and  shall   discharge  all  attendant
               liabilities   to  the   extent   of  its   indemnity   hereunder.
               Notwithstanding   any   acknowledgment   made   pursuant  to  the
               immediately preceding two sentences, the Indemnifying Party shall
               continue  to  be  entitled  to  assert  any   limitation  on  its
               indemnification   responsibility   contained  in  Sections  15(j)
               through  15(l).   Should  the   Indemnifying   Party  assume  and
               reasonably  pursue  the  defense  of a  Third  Party  Claim,  the
               Indemnifying  Party shall not be liable to the Indemnified  Party
               for legal expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party
               in connection with the defense thereof. If the Indemnifying Party
               assumes such defense,  the Indemnified Party shall have the right
               to participate in the defense thereof and to employ  counsel,  at
               its own  expense,  separate  from  the  counsel  employed  by the
               Indemnifying  Party,  it  being  understood,  however,  that  the
               Indemnifying  Party shall control such defense.  The Indemnifying
               Party  shall  be  liable  for the fees and  expenses  of  counsel
               employed by the Indemnified Party for any period during which the
               Indemnifying  Party has not  assumed and  reasonably  pursued the
               defense thereof. Whether or not the Indemnifying Party chooses to
               defend  any Third  Party  Claim,  all the  parties  hereto  shall
               cooperate  in the  defense or  prosecution  of such  Third  Party
               Claim.  Such  cooperation  shall  include the  retention  and the
               provision  of  records  and  information   which  are  reasonably
               relevant  to  such  Third  Party  Claim,   and  making  employees
               available on a mutually  convenient  basis to provide  additional
               information and explanation of any material  provided  hereunder.
               If the  Indemnifying  Party has  assumed  the  defense of a Third
               Party Claim, the Indemnified  Party shall not admit any liability
               with respect to, or settle,  compromise or discharge,  or consent
               to the entry of any  judgment  with  respect to, such Third Party
               Claim without the  Indemnifying  Party's  prior  written  consent
               (which  consent  shall  not  be  unreasonably  withheld).  If the
               Indemnifying Party does not assume the defense of any Third Party
               Claim, the Indemnified Party may settle or defend the Third Party
               Claim in any  manner  it shall in its sole  discretion  determine
               appropriate  and any such  settlement or defense shall not in any
               way affect the Indemnifying Party's indemnity hereunder.

     (g)  Waiver of Subrogation.  Each party hereby waives,  or will procure the
          waiver of,  any  subrogation  rights  that its  insurer  may have with
          respect to any indemnifiable Losses to the extent reasonably possible.

     (h)  Attorneys' Fees. In connection with any litigation arising out of this
          Agreement  or to enforce any  indemnification  claim  pursuant to this
          Agreement,  the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover from the
          nonprevailing  party its  reasonable  attorneys'  fees and  costs,  on
          appeal or otherwise.

     (i)  Time Limitation.  Except as otherwise  expressly  provided herein, any
          claim by any Buyer Indemnified Party for indemnity arising pursuant to
          Sections  15(b)(iv)(B) shall be brought within two (2) years after the
          Closing  Date,  except  that any claim for  indemnity  related  to tax
          matters  or  third  party  bodily  injury  or  wrongful  death  claims
          (excluding  liability for property  damage) may be brought at any time
          prior to the end of the applicable  statute of limitations.  All other
          indemnity  claims  shall  have no limit as to time.  A claim  shall be
          deemed  to  have  been  brought   only  upon   delivery  of  a  proper
          Indemnification  Notice to the other  party at the notice  address set
          forth in  Section  20.  Any  claim  required  to be made  within  such
          respective  limitations  period  not so timely  made  shall be forever
          barred.

     (j)  General Indemnity  Deductible.  Except as otherwise expressly provided
          in this  Agreement,  Buyer  shall have no claim  under this  Agreement
          against  Seller for any Losses  unless and until the  aggregate of all
          such Losses,  other than Losses that  constitute,  relate to, or arise
          out  of  Environmental  Liabilities  (which  are  not  subject  to any
          deductible),  incurred or sustained by the Buyer  Indemnified  Parties
          exceeds two hundred fifty  thousand  dollars  ($250,000) and then only
          for the excess over two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000). If,
          between the Effective Time and the Closing Date, Buyer notifies Seller
          in writing of a breach of a  representation  or  warranty of Seller in
          this  Agreement  for which Buyer would be entitled to  indemnification
          under this  Section 15, and Seller does not cure such breach  prior to
          the Closing, the deductibles in this Section 15(j) will not apply with
          respect to any such indemnification claim by Buyer.


     (k)  Cap on  Certain of  Seller's  Indemnification  Liabilities.  Except as
          otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement,  Seller's aggregate
          liability for

          (i)  indemnification  pursuant to Section 15(b)(iv)(B),  to the extent
               and only to the extent that the  indemnification  does not relate
               to title to the Purchased Assets;

          (ii) indemnification  pursuant to Section 15(b)(v),  to the extent and
               only to the extent the  indemnification  does not relate to title
               to the Purchased Assets; and

          (iii)indemnification  pursuant to Sections 15(b)(i) and 15(b)(ii),  to
               the extent and only to the extent the indemnification  relates to
               items covered by Section  4(b)(ix) that were not within  Seller's
               Knowledge  as of the Closing  Date,  shall in no event  exceed an
               amount equal to twenty million  dollars  ($20,000,000);  provided
               that in no event shall this  Section  15(k) apply to matters that
               arise  out of,  are  caused by or  relate  to  Seller's  fraud or
               willful  misconduct.  For the avoidance of doubt,  Seller's other
               indemnification  obligations  set forth in this Agreement are not
               subject to this Section 15(k).

     (l)  Mitigation.  Each party hereto shall take all reasonable steps and use
          all commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any and all Losses.

     (m)  Losses.  As used in this Agreement,  "Losses" means any and all costs,
          claims,  losses,  liabilities,  obligations  (including corrective and
          remedial obligations), damages and expenses including reasonable legal
          fees and  expenses,  and  liability for  consequential  damages,  lost
          profits, or punitive damages to third parties whose claims are subject
          to indemnification  under this Agreement,  but excluding any liability
          to the other party to this Agreement for consequential  damages,  lost
          profits or  punitive  damages  suffered,  incurred  or claimed by such
          other party.

     16. TAXES AND OTHER PRORATIONS.

     (a)  Except as provided in this  Section 16,  Buyer shall be liable for and
          pay all Taxes  (other than taxes based in whole or part upon  Seller's
          income),  utility charges or apportionments which arise as a result of
          this Agreement or the  consummation of the  transactions  contemplated
          hereby or as a result of any purchase,  sale, rental,  lease, storage,
          use, consumption or operation of the Purchased Assets by Buyer. Seller
          agrees to cooperate  with and assist Buyer in claiming any  applicable
          occasional sale or sales tax exemption; provided that Seller shall not
          incur  any  unreimbursed   third-party   costs,   expenses,   fees  or
          liabilities as a result of or in any way relating to, the provision of
          such assistance.

     (b)  General  and  special  real  estate  and  other ad  valorem  taxes and
          assessments  and  other  state  or  local  taxes,  fees,  charges  and
          assessments  in  respect of real  property  on the basis of the fiscal
          year in which the Closing  occurs shall be prorated  between Buyer and
          Seller as of 12:01 a.m.,  Central  Time,  on the Closing  Date. If the
          Closing  Date shall occur before the tax rate or  assessment  is fixed
          for such fiscal year, the  apportionment of such taxes and payments at
          the Closing  shall be based upon the most recently  ascertainable  tax
          bills;   provided,   that  Buyer  and  Seller  shall  recalculate  and
          re-prorate  said  taxes  and  payments  and  make the  necessary  cash
          adjustments  promptly  upon the  issuance,  and on the  basis,  of the
          actual tax bills  received  for the fiscal  year in which the  Closing
          occurs and the amount of any payments in lieu of tax made with respect
          to any such fiscal year.

     (c)  Personal  property  taxes,  if any, on the basis of the fiscal year in
          which the Closing occurs,  utility charges and other items customarily
          prorated in transaction of the type  contemplated  by this  Agreement,
          shall be prorated  between Buyer and Seller as of 12:01 a.m.,  Central
          Time,  on the Closing Date. If the Closing Date shall occur before the
          tax  rate  or   assessment   is  fixed  for  such  fiscal  year,   the
          apportionment  of such  taxes at the  Closing  shall  be based  upon a
          reasonable   estimate  mutually  agreed  upon  by  Buyer  and  Seller;
          provided,  that Buyer and Seller shall recalculate and re-prorate said
          taxes  and make  the  necessary  cash  adjustments  promptly  upon the
          issuance  of, and on the basis of, the actual tax bills  received  for
          such fiscal year.

     (d)  Three days prior to Closing,  Seller shall  deliver to Buyer  Seller's
          good faith  estimate of the  prorations  required by this  Section 16,
          which shall be used for  purposes of Closing.  As soon as  practicable
          after Closing,  the estimated  prorations shall be adjusted to reflect
          actual charges, and any necessary reimbursements shall be made between
          the Parties.

     17. RECORDS/LITIGATION ASSISTANCE.

     (a)  For a period of seven (7) years  following  the  Closing  Date,  Buyer
          shall  provide  to Seller  (and its  counsel,  auditors,  accountants,
          agents,  advisors or other  representatives)  reasonable access to and
          permission to make copies of any books,  records or accounts  relating
          to the Pipeline  Interest  through and including the Closing Date; and
          Buyer  shall not  destroy or dispose of any such  books,  records  and
          accounts  for a period of at least  seven (7) years  after the Closing
          Date without first offering to surrender to Seller such books, records
          and accounts  which Buyer may intend to destroy or dispose of.  Seller
          agrees that it will  consult  with Buyer in advance of taking any such
          actions following the Closing Date with a view towards  establishing a
          mutually agreeable plan for such visits so that these actions will not
          unreasonably  interfere  with the  normal  operation  of the  Pipeline
          Interest.

     (b)  After the Closing Date,  each party shall  provide such  assistance as
          the other party may from time to time reasonably request in connection
          with the preparation of tax returns required to be filed, any audit or
          other   examination   by  any  taxing   authority,   any  judicial  or
          administrative  proceeding  relating to  liability  for taxes,  or any
          claim for refund in respect  of such Taxes or in  connection  with any
          litigation  and  proceedings  or  liabilities  related to the Pipeline
          Interest,   including  making  available   employees  for  interviews,
          litigation  preparation  and  testimony.  The  requesting  party shall
          reimburse the assisting party for the out-of-pocket  costs incurred by
          the assisting party.

     (c)  If  Buyer,  as a  result  of the  transactions  contemplated  by  this
          Agreement,  at any time within  twelve  (12) months  after the Closing
          Date, is required to file with the Securities and Exchange  Commission
          financial  statements relating to the Pipeline Interest,  Seller shall
          provide such assistance as Buyer may reasonably  request in connection
          with the preparation of such financial statements, including providing
          to Buyer Seller's books,  records or accounts relating to the Pipeline
          Interest and relevant  personnel relating to the Pipeline Interest and
          access to Seller's  independent  auditors from the date hereof through
          and  including the Closing Date and for a period of twelve (12) months
          thereafter;  provided  that  Seller  shall not incur any  unreimbursed
          third-party costs, expenses,  fees or liabilities as a result of or in
          any way relating to, the provision of such assistance.

     18. TERMINATION RIGHTS.

     (a)  This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing Date
          as follows and in no other manner:

          (i)  by mutual written consent of Buyer and Seller;

          (ii) by Buyer,  if any of the  conditions set forth in Section 12 have
               not  been  satisfied  as of the  Closing  Date  or if any of such
               conditions  shall become  incapable of being  satisfied and shall
               not have been waived by Buyer (provided,  however,  that Buyer is
               not in material breach of its obligations under this Agreement);

          (iii)by Seller,  if any of the conditions set forth in Section 13 have
               not  been  satisfied  as of  the  Closing  Date  or if  any  such
               conditions  shall become  incapable of being  satisfied and shall
               not have been waived by Seller (provided, however, that Seller is
               not in material breach of its obligations under this Agreement);

          (iv) by Seller,  if the Closing  does not occur on or prior to January
               31, 2003; provided that such failure of the Closing is not due to
               Seller's material breach of its obligations under this Agreement;

          (v)  by Buyer,  if the  Closing  does not occur on or prior to January
               31, 2003; provided that such failure of the Closing is not due to
               Buyer's material breach of its obligations  under this Agreement;
               or

          (vi) by Buyer and/or Seller as provided if either makes an election to
               terminate in Section 10(c)(ix).

     (b)  In the  event  of  termination  by Buyer or  Seller  pursuant  to this
          Section 18,  written  notice  thereof shall  forthwith be given to the
          other party, and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall
          be terminated  without  further action  required by any party.  If the
          transactions contemplated by this Agreement are terminated as provided
          herein:

          (i)  Buyer shall return to Seller all  documents  and copies and other
               materials  received  from or on behalf of Seller  relating to the
               transactions  contemplated hereby,  whether so obtained before or
               after the execution hereof; and

          (ii) all  confidential  information  received by Buyer with respect to
               the Purchased  Assets,  the Assumed  Liabilities and the Pipeline
               Interest  shall be  treated  in  accordance  with the  terms  and
               conditions of the Confidentiality  Agreement,  which shall remain
               in full force and effect  notwithstanding the termination of this
               Agreement.

     (c)  If this  Agreement is  terminated  and the  transactions  contemplated
          hereby are  abandoned as described in this Section 18, this  Agreement

party of the terms and provisions of this Agreement.

     22.  PUBLICITY.  Buyer and Seller agree that,  from the date hereof through
and including the Closing Date, no public release or announcement concerning the
transactions  contemplated  hereby  shall be issued or made by any party  hereto
without  the  prior  consent  of the other  party  (which  consent  shall not be
unreasonably  withheld),  except  (a) as such  release  or  announcement  may be
required by law or the rules or regulations  of any  securities  exchange (or in
the opinion of counsel such release or  announcement is appropriate or desirable
under or in light of such laws and regulations),  in which case the party making
the  release or  announcement  shall allow the other  party  reasonable  time to
comment on such release or  announcement  in advance of such  issuance,  and (b)
that  Seller  and Buyer may each make  such an  announcement  to its  employees.

     23.   SURVIVAL  OF   COVENANTS,   REPRESENTATIONS   AND   WARRANTIES.   All
representations  and warranties in this Agreement  shall survive the Closing and
may be enforced  for a period of two (2) years from and after the Closing  Date,
except that (i) the  environmental  representations  and warranties in Section 7
shall survive for a period of three (3) years after the Closing  Date;  (ii) any
representation  and  warranties  related to tax matters in Section  6(q) and any
representation  or  warranty  the breach of which would  result in an  indemnity
claim  for third  party  bodily  injury  or  wrongful  death  claims  (excluding
liability for property  damage)  shall  survive until the end of the  applicable
statute of limitations; and (iii) the representations and warranties provided in
Section 6(f)(i) with respect to the Terminal Real Property shall not survive and
shall  terminate  at Closing;  provided,  however,  the  foregoing  shall not be
interpreted to cause the limited  warranty set forth in the deeds referred to in
Section 5(b)(i) to terminate at Closing. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence,
if prior to the  applicable  expiration  of the time  periods  set forth  above,
either Party provides the other Party with written notice of a specific  alleged
breach of a representation or warranty, such representation and warranty, to the
extent that it relates to such  specific  alleged  breach,  shall  survive until
final resolution of all matters related to such alleged breach. Unless otherwise
limited by this Agreement, the covenants in this Agreement shall survive Closing
so long as they are  executory  in nature.  The parties  agree and hereby  state
their mutual intention that the representations,  warranties and covenants under
this Agreement  shall survive the parties'  execution and delivery of the deeds,
bills of sale and  assignment  instruments  to be  executed  under  Section 5 at
Closing for the above periods and shall not be merged therein.

     24. ENTIRE AGREEMENT.  This Agreement,  the attached Schedules and Exhibits
and the agreements  referred to herein or executed in connection  herewith,  set
forth the entire  agreement and  understanding  of the parties in respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and supersede all prior agreements,
arrangements and undertakings,  whether written or oral, relating to the subject
matter hereof (other than the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall continue in
effect).  No  representation,  promise,  inducement  or statement of  intention,
whether  written or oral, has been made by any party which is not embodied in or
superseded  by  this  Agreement  or  the  Confidentiality  Agreement  or in  the
documents  attached  hereto,  referred  to  herein  or  executed  in  connection
herewith,   and  no  party   shall  be  bound  by  or  liable  for  any  alleged
representation,  promise,  inducement or statement of intention not so set forth
whether in any  confidential  information  memorandum,  in certain "data rooms,"
management  presentations  or any other form in expectation of the  transactions
contemplated by this  Agreement.  Except as otherwise  specifically  provided in
this Agreement, no conditions, usage of trade, course of dealing or performance,
understanding or agreement purporting to modify, vary, explain or supplement the
terms or conditions of this Agreement  will be binding unless  hereafter made in
writing  and  signed  by the  party to be  bound,  and no  modification  will be
effected by the  acknowledgment  or acceptance of documents  containing terms or
conditions at variance with or in addition to those set forth in this Agreement,
except as otherwise specifically agreed to by the parties in writing.

     25.  ASSIGNMENT.  This Agreement and any rights and  obligations  hereunder
shall  not be  assignable  or  transferable  by Buyer or  Seller  (including  by
operation  of law in  connection  with a  merger  or sale of  stock,  or sale of
substantially  all the assets,  of Buyer or Seller)  without  the prior  written
consent of the other party and any  purported  assignment  without  such consent
shall be void and  without  effect;  provided,  however,  that each of Buyer and
Seller may (a) assign any and all of its rights and  interests  hereunder to one
or more of its  affiliates  and (b) designate  one or more of its  affiliates to
perform  its  obligations  hereunder;  provided  further  that each of Buyer and
Seller shall remain  responsible  for the  performance  of all of its respective
obligations  hereunder.  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  Seller  may assign or
transfer any or all of its rights  hereunder to any  qualified  intermediary  in
order to complete an exchange of like-kind  property  under  Section 1031 of the
Code and, at the request of Seller,  Buyer shall  execute  such  agreements  and
other  documents  as may be  necessary,  in the  reasonable  opinion of Seller's
counsel, to complete and otherwise effectuate Seller's exchange of properties in
accordance  with said Section 1031 of the Code and the  regulations  thereunder;
provided  that  Buyer  shall not  incur  any  unreimbursed  third  party  costs,
expenses,  fees or  liabilities as a result of or connected with the exchange or
Seller's failure to obtain any desired tax treatment with respect  thereto.  The
rights,  interests and  obligations  hereunder shall be binding upon the parties
hereto, their successor and their permitted assigns.

     26.  AMENDMENT  AND  WAIVER.  This  Agreement  may  be  amended,  modified,
superseded  or  canceled,  and  any of the  terms,  covenants,  representations,
warranties  or  conditions  hereof may be waived,  only by a written  instrument
executed by the parties hereto,  or, in the case of a waiver, by or on behalf of
the party waiving  compliance.  The failure of any party at any time or times to
require  performance of any provision hereof shall in no manner affect the right
at a later time to enforce the same. No waiver by any party of any condition, or
of any breach of any term,  covenant,  representation  or warranty  contained in
this Agreement, in any one or more instances, shall be deemed to be or construed
as a further or continuing waiver of any such condition or breach or a waiver of
any other condition or of any breach of any other term, covenant  representation
or  warranty.  No course of  dealing  between  or among any  Persons  having any
interest  in this  Agreement  shall be  deemed  effective  to  modify,  amend or
discharge any part of this  Agreement or any rights or obligations of any Person
under or by reason of this Agreement.

     27.  EXPENSES.  Whether  or not the  transactions  contemplated  hereby are
consummated,  and except as otherwise  specifically  provided in this Agreement,
all costs and  expenses  incurred  in  connection  with this  Agreement  and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including legal, due diligence, accounting and
investment banking fees and expenses,  shall be paid by the party incurring such
costs or expenses.

     28.  HEADINGS.  The  section  and  paragraph  headings  contained  in  this
Agreement are for reference  purposes  only, and shall not in any way affect the
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

     29. COUNTERPARTS.  This Agreement may be executed  simultaneously in one or
more counterparts  (including by means of telecopied  signature  pages),  all of
which shall be considered one and the same agreement, and shall become effective
when one or more such  counterparts  have been signed by each of the parties and
delivered to the other party.

     30. INTERPRETATION. Unless the context requires otherwise:

     (a)  this Agreement  includes this Asset  Purchase  Agreement and any other
          agreement  entered  into by Buyer and Seller on the Closing Date or in
          connection with the transactions contemplated hereby;

     (b)  the singular shall include the plural and the plural shall include the
          singular  and any gender  shall  include all other  genders all as the
          meaning and the context of the Agreement shall require;

     (c)  references   to  Sections  and   paragraphs   refer  to  sections  and
          paragraphs, respectively, of this Agreement;

     (d)  references  to Exhibits and  Schedules  are to exhibits and  schedules
          attached to this Agreement,  each of which is hereby  incorporated and
          made a part of this Agreement for all purposes as if set forth in full
          herein;

     (e)  the words "including,"  "include," "includes" and all variants thereof
          mean "including, without limitation;"

     (f)  the words "hereof," "herein,"  "hereunder,"  "hereby," and other words
          or similar  import  refer to this  Agreement as a whole and not to any
          particular Section, paragraph or sentence; and

     (g)  all  references  to "dollars" in this  Agreement  are to United States
          dollars.

     31. NO STRICT  CONSTRUCTION.  Notwithstanding  the fact that this Agreement
has been  drafted or prepared by one of the  parties,  Buyer and Seller  confirm
that  both they and their  respective  counsel  have  reviewed,  negotiated  and
adopted this Agreement as the joint agreement and  understanding of the parties,
and the  language  used in this  Agreement  shall be deemed  to be the  language
chosen by the parties  hereto to express  their  mutual  intent,  and no rule of
strict construction shall be applied against any Person.

     32. SCHEDULES.  As referenced  herein,  the word "Schedules" shall mean the
Schedules  attached to this  Agreement.  The  inclusion  of  information  in the
Schedules hereto shall not be construed as an admission that such information is
material to the Pipeline Interest, the Purchased Assets, the Assumed Liabilities
or Seller.  In addition,  matters reflected in the Schedules are not necessarily
limited to matters required by this Agreement to be reflected in such Schedules.
Such additional matters are set forth for informational purposes only and do not
necessarily  include  other  matters  of a similar  nature.  The  Schedules  are
incorporated herein by reference and made a part hereof.

     33. REPRESENTATION BY COUNSEL; INTERPRETATION. Buyer and Seller acknowledge
that  each of them has been  represented  by  counsel  in  connection  with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. Accordingly, any rule of law
or  any  legal  decision  that  would  require  interpretation  of  any  claimed
ambiguities  in  this  Agreement  against  the  party  that  drafted  it  has no
application and is expressly waived.

     34. SEVERABILITY. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement shall
be interpreted in such manner as to be valid and effective under applicable law,
but if any provision of this Agreement or the  application of any such provision
to any Person or circumstance shall be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in
any respect by a court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability  shall not affect any other  provision  hereof.  In such event,
however,  the parties  shall  negotiate in good faith to replace such invalid or
unenforceable  provision with a valid and enforceable provision that places each
party in substantially the same position it would have been in had such original
provision been valid and enforceable.

     35. BULK TRANSFER LAWS.  Buyer hereby waives  compliance by Seller with the
provisions of any so-called bulk transfer laws of any jurisdiction in connection
with the purchase and sale of the Purchased Assets;  provided,  however, that in
accordance  with Section 15, Seller shall indemnify and hold Buyer harmless from
any Losses which Buyer may incur due to failure to comply with such laws.

     36. NO THIRD  PARTY  BENEFICIARIES.  Except as  provided  with  respect  to
indemnification  as set forth in Section  15 and  elsewhere  in this  Agreement,
nothing in this Agreement shall confer any rights upon any Person other than the
parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

     37.  DEFINITION OF AFFILIATE.  As used herein,  the term "affiliate"  shall
have the meaning set forth in Rule 405  promulgated  under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended.

     38.  TIME OF  ESSENCE.  With  regard to all rights and  obligations  of the
parties  and all  dates  and  time  periods  set  forth or  referred  to in this
Agreement, time is of the essence.

     39. NO  CONDITIONS.  For the  avoidance of doubt,  the only  conditions  to
closing are those set forth in Sections 12 and 13 herein, and no other covenants
or conditions set forth in this Agreement are intended to have any effect on the
Closing.
