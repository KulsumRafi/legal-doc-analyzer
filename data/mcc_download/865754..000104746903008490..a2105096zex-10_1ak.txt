      1. Paragraph 9.1 of Article 9 of the Sauer-Danfoss Inc. Non-Employee
Director Stock Option and Restricted Stock Plan (the "Plan") provides that it
may be amended by action of the Board of Directors of Sauer-Danfoss Inc. (the
"Company"). In accordance with the provisions of that paragraph and pursuant to
resolutions duly adopted by the Board of Directors of the Company, the Plan is
hereby amended as follows:

      (a)   The existing subparagraph (iii) of Article 2.(e) is deleted in its
            entirety and new subparagraphs (iii) and (iv) of said Article 2.(e)
            are added to read as follows:

            "(iii) The stockholders of the Company approve a plan of complete
                   liquidation of the Company; or

            (iv)   The consummation of: (i) the sale or disposition of all or
                   substantially all of the Company's assets; or (ii) a merger,
                   consolidation, or reorganization of the Company with or
                   involving any other corporation or entity, other than a
                   merger, consolidation, or reorganization that would result in
                   the voting securities of the Company outstanding immediately
                   prior thereto continuing to represent (either by remaining
                   outstanding or by being converted into voting securities of
                   the surviving entity) at least fifty percent (50%) of the
                   combined voting power of the voting securities of the Company
                   (or such surviving entity) outstanding immediately after such
                   merger, consolidation, or reorganization"

      2. The changes made by this Amendment shall not apply to Awards (as
defined in the Plan) that are outstanding under the Plan prior to the date this
Amendment was adopted by the Board of Directors of the Company.

                                        The above Amendment was duly adopted by
                                        resolutions passed by the Board of
                                        Directors of the Company at its meeting
                                        held on December 4, 2002
