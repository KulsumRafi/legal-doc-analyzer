<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reference is made to the Asset Purchase Agreement dated as of the date
hereof between Celgene Corporation (&#147;<u>Celgene</u>&#148;) and EntreMed, Inc. (&#147;<u>EntreMed</u>&#148;).
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In consideration of the undertakings of Celgene contained in the Asset
Purchase Agreement, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt
and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged by EntreMed, EntreMed agrees as
follows:
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a period of ninety (90)&nbsp;days from the date hereof (the &#147;<u>Review
Period</u>&#148;), neither EntreMed nor any of its affiliates will enter into any
agreement, arrangement or understanding with respect to any merger,
consolidation or other business combination involving EntreMed or the
acquisition of all or any significant portion of the assets or capital stock of
EntreMed (an &#147;<u>Acquisition Transaction</u>&#148;); provided, however, that an Acquisition
Transaction shall not be deemed to include any such transaction that only
involves MaxCyte, Inc. However, EntreMed or any of its affiliates, and the
respective directors, officers, employees, agents or representatives of the
foregoing (including, without limitation, any investment banker, attorney or
accountant retained by EntreMed) may, directly or indirectly, solicit,
initiate, facilitate or encourage (including by way of furnishing or disclosing
non-public information) any inquiries or the making of any proposal with
respect to or which may reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition
Transaction, or negotiate, explore or otherwise engage in discussions with any
corporation, partnership, person, other entity or &#147;group&#148; (as defined in
Section&nbsp;13(d)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) in
furtherance of such inquiries or with respect to any Acquisition Transaction.
EntreMed may also enter into any transaction exclusively regarding
non-oncology indications. During the Review Period, EntreMed shall immediately
advise Celgene in writing of any proposals (or desire to make a proposal)
received by (or indicated to) it, any of its affiliates, or any of the
respective directors, officers, employees, agents or representatives of any of
the foregoing, from a corporation, partnership, person or other entity or group
(other than Celgene and its representatives) with respect to an Acquisition
Transaction, and the terms thereof, including the identity of such third party,
and to update on an ongoing basis or upon Celgene&#146;s request the status thereof;
<u>provided</u>, <u>however</u>, that no such notice is required for any transactions
exclusively regarding non-oncology indications.
