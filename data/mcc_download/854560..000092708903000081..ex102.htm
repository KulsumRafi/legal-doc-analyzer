to perform stated duties, willful violation of any law, rule, or regulation (excluding violations which do not have an
adverse affect on the Company or the Bank) or final cease-and-desist order, or (except as provided below) material
breach of any provision of this Agreement.  No act or failure to act by the Employee shall be considered willful unless
the Employee acted or failed to act with an absence of good faith and without a reasonable belief that his action or
failure to act was in the best interest of the Company.  The Employee shall not be deemed to have been Terminated for
Cause unless and until there shall have been delivered to the Employee a copy of a resolution, duly adopted by the
affirmative vote of not less than a majority of the entire membership of the Board of Directors at a meeting of the Board
duly called and held for such purpose (after reasonable notice to the Employee and an opportunity for the Employee,
together with the Employee's counsel, to be heard before the Board), stating that in the good faith opinion of the Board
of Directors the Employee has engaged in conduct described in the preceding sentence and specifying the particulars
thereof in detail.</FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Term; Termination of Prior Employment Agreement</U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The term of this Agreement shall be a period of five

Company has not given notice to the Employee in writing at least 90 days prior to such anniversary that the term of this
Agreement shall not be extended further, and <U>provided further that</U> the Employee has not received an unsatisfactory
performance review by either the Board of Directors or the board of directors of the Bank.  The Employee's Prior
Employment Agreement shall terminate immediately prior to the Effective Date, subject to reinstatement as provided
in Section 16 below.</FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Employment</U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Employee is employed as the Chairman of the Company and the Bank.  As such, the

similar executive capacities, and shall have such other powers and duties as the Board of Directors or the board of
directors of the Bank may prescribe from time to time.  The Employee shall also render services to any subsidiary or
subsidiaries of the Company or the Bank as requested by the Company or the Bank from time to time consistent with<br>

his executive position.  The Employee shall devote his best efforts and reasonable time and attention to the business and
affairs of the Company and the Bank to the extent necessary to discharge his responsibilities hereunder.  The Employee
may (i) serve on corporate or charitable boards or committees, and (ii) manage personal investments, so long as such
activities do not interfere materially with performance of his responsibilities hereunder. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Cash Compensation</U>.</FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Salary</U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company agrees to pay the Employee during the term of this Agreement a base salary
(the "Company Salary") the annualized amount of which shall be not less than the annualized aggregate amount of the
Employee's base salary from the Company and any Consolidated Subsidiaries in effect at the Effective Date; <U>provided
that</U> any amounts of salary actually paid to the Employee by any Consolidated Subsidiaries shall reduce the amount to
be paid by the Company to the Employee.  The Company Salary, excluding the bonus, shall be paid no less frequently
than monthly and shall be subject to customary tax withholding.  The amount of the Employee's Company Salary shall
be increased (but shall not be decreased other than prior to a Change in Control as part of an overall program applied
uniformly and with equitable effect to all members of senior management of the Company or the Bank) from time to
time in accordance with the amounts of salary approved by the Board of Directors or the board of directors of any of
the Consolidated Subsidiaries after the Effective Date.</FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Bonuses</U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Employee shall be entitled to participate in an equitable manner with all other
executive officers of the Company and the Bank in such performance-based and discretionary bonuses, if any, as are
authorized and declared by the Board of Directors for executive officers of the Company and by the board of directors
of the Bank for executive officers of the Bank.  Additionally, the Employee shall continue to receive a bonus payable
annually equal to 1/2% of the Company's fiscal year pre-tax earnings.</FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Expenses</U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Employee shall be entitled to receive prompt reimbursement for all reasonable
expenses incurred by the Employee in performing services under this Agreement in accordance with the policies and
procedures applicable to the executive officers of the Company and the Bank, <U>provided that</U> the Employee accounts for
such expenses as required under such policies and procedures.</FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Deferral of Non-Deductible Compensation</U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event that the Employee's aggregate
compensation (including compensatory benefits which are deemed remuneration for purposes of Section 162(m) of the
Code) from the Company and the Consolidated Subsidiaries for any calendar year exceeds the greater of (i) $1,000,000
or (ii) the maximum amount of compensation deductible by the Company or any of the Consolidated Subsidiaries in
any calendar year under Section 162(m) of the Code (the "maximum allowable amount"), then any such amount in
excess of the maximum allowable amount shall be mandatorily deferred (with interest thereon at an annual rate equal
to the Federal short-term rate under Section 1274(d)(1) of the Code, determined as of the last day of the calendar year
in which the Employee's compensation is first not deductible under Section 162(m) of the Code, per annum,
compounded annually), to a calendar year such that the amount to be paid to the Employee in such calendar year,
including deferred amounts and interest thereon, does not exceed the maximum allowable amount.  Subject to the
foregoing, deferred amounts including interest thereon shall be payable at the earliest time permissible.  All unpaid
deferred amounts shall be paid to the Employee not later than his Date of Termination unless his Date of Termination
is on a December 31<SUP>st</SUP>, in which case, the unpaid deferred amounts shall be paid to the Employee on the first business
day of the next succeeding calendar year.  The provisions of this subsection shall survive any termination of the
Employee's employment and any termination of this Agreement.</FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Benefits</U>.</FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Participation in Benefit Plans</U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Employee shall be entitled to participate, to the same extent

pension, retirement, thrift, profit-sharing, savings, group or other life insurance, hospitalization, medical and dental
coverage, travel and accident insurance, education, cash bonuses, and other retirement or employee benefits or
combinations thereof.  In addition, the Employee shall be entitled to be considered for benefits under all of the stock
and stock option related plans in which the Company's or the Bank's executive officers are eligible or become eligible
to participate. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Fringe Benefits</U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Employee shall be eligible to participate in, and receive benefits under, any
other fringe benefit plans or perquisites which are or may become generally available to the Company's or the Bank's
executive officers, including but not limited to supplemental retirement, incentive compensation, supplemental medical
or life insurance plans, company cars, club dues, physical examinations, financial planning and tax preparation services.</FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Vacations; Leave</U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Employee shall be entitled to annual paid vacation in accordance with the policies
established by the Board of Directors and the board of directors of the Bank for executive officers, in no event less than

such conditions as the Board of Directors may determine in its discretion.</FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Termination of Employment</U>.</FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Involuntary Termination</U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Employee experiences an Involuntary Termination, such
termination of employment shall be subject to the Company's obligations under this Section 7.  In the event of the
Involuntary Termination of the Employee, if the Employee has offered to continue to provide the services contemplated
by and on the terms provided in this Agreement and such offer has been declined, then, subject to Section 7(b) of this
Agreement, the Company shall, during the portion of the term of this Agreement remaining following the Date of
Termination (the "Liquidated Damage Period"), as damages for breach of contract  (i) pay to the Employee monthly one-twelfth of the Company Salary at the annual rate in effect immediately prior to the Date of Termination and one-twelfth
of the average annual amount of cash bonus and cash incentive compensation of the Employee, based on the average
amounts of such compensation earned by the Employee from the Company and the Bank for the two full fiscal years
preceding the Date of Termination; and (ii) maintain substantially the same group life insurance, hospitalization,
medical, dental, prescription drug and other health benefits, and long-term disability insurance (if any) for the benefit
of the Employee and his dependents and beneficiaries who would have been eligible for such benefits if the Employee
had not suffered Involuntary Termination and on terms substantially as favorable to the Employee including amounts
of coverage and deductibles and other costs to him in effect immediately prior to such Involuntary Termination (the
"Employee's Health Coverage").</FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Reduction of the Company's Obligations Under Section 7(a)</U>.</FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event that the Employee becomes entitled to liquidated damages pursuant to
Section 7(a), (i) the Company's obligation thereunder with respect to cash damages shall be reduced by the amount of
the Employee's earned income within the meaning of 4,6 911(d)(2)(A) of the Code, if any, earned from providing
personal services during the Liquidated Damage Period; and (ii) the Company's obligation to maintain Health Coverage
shall be reduced to the extent, if any, that the Employee receives such benefits, on no less favorable terms, from another
employer during the Liquidated Damage Period.  To the extent the provisions of this Section 7(b)(1) are applicable and
an overpayment has been made to the Employee as of the expiration of Liquidated Damage Period, the Employee shall
reimburse the Company in an amount equal to the after tax benefit realized by the Employee from such overpayment
(i.e. amount realized net of all federal, state, local, employment and medicare taxes).  In making the reimbursement
calculation it shall be presumed that the Employee is subject to the highest marginal federal and state income tax rates.</FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;The Employee agrees that in the event he becomes entitled to liquidated damages
pursuant to Section 7(a), throughout the Liquidated Damage Period, he shall promptly inform the Company of the nature
and amounts of earned income and the type of health benefits and coverage which he earns or receives from providing
personal services, and shall provide such documentation of such earned income and such health benefits and coverage
as the Company may request.  In the event of changes to such earned income or such health benefits or coverage from
time to time, the Employee shall inform the Company of such changes, in each case within five days after the change
occurs, and shall provide such documentation concerning the change as the Company may request.</FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Change in Control; Cut Back; and Tax Gross Up</U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event that the Employee experiences
an Involuntary Termination within the 12 months preceding, at the time of, or within 24 months following a Change in
Control, in addition to the Company's obligations under Section 7(a) of this Agreement, the Company shall pay to the
Employee in cash, within 30 days after the later of the date of such Change in Control or the Date of Termination, an
amount equal to 299% of the Employee's "base amount" as determined under Section 280G of the Code. </FONT></P>

<br><br>
<font size="-1"><center>4</center><a href="#5">NEXT PAGE</a></font><br><br><br><br>
<a name="5"></a>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event that any payments, distributions or benefits provided or to be provided to the Employee,
whether pursuant to this Agreement or from other plans or arrangements maintained by the Company or any of the
Consolidated Subsidiaries (<U>excluding</U> the Gross Up Payment and Additional Gross Up Payment (as such terms are
hereinafter defined)) (collectively, the "Payment") would be subject to excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code (such
excise tax and any penalties and interest collectively, the "Penalty Tax"), the Company shall pay to the Employee in cash
an additional amount equal to the Adjusted Gross Up Payment.  The "Gross Up Payment" shall be an amount such that
after payment by the Employee of all federal, state, local, employment and medicare taxes thereon (and any penalties
and interest with respect thereto), the Employee retains on an after tax basis a portion of such amount equal to the
aggregate of 100% of the Penalty Tax imposed upon the Payment and 100% of the Penalty Tax imposed upon the
Adjusted Gross Up Payment. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For purposes of determining the amount of the Gross Up Payment, the value of any non-cash benefits
and deferred payments or benefits subject to the Penalty Tax shall be determined by the Company's independent auditors
in accordance with the principles of Section 280G(d)(3) and (4) of the Code.  In the event that, after the Gross Up
Payment is made, the Employee becomes entitled to receive a refund of any portion of the Penalty Tax, the Employee
shall promptly pay to the Company 100% of such Penalty Tax refund attributable to the Payment (together with 100%
of any interest paid or credited thereon by the Internal Revenue Service) and 100% of the Penalty Tax refund attributable
to the Gross Up Payment (together with 100% of any interest paid or credited thereon by the Internal Revenue Service).</FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the uncertainty regarding the application of Section 4999 of the Code, it is possible that
the Internal Revenue Service may assert that the Penalty Tax due is in excess of the amount of the anticipated Penalty
Tax used in calculating the Adjusted Gross Up Payment (such excess amount is hereafter referred to as the
"Underpayment").  In such event, the Company shall pay to the Employee, in immediately available funds, at the time
the Underpayment is assessed or otherwise determined, an additional amount equal to the Additional Gross Up Payment.
The "Additional Gross Up Payment" shall be an amount such that after payment by the Employee of all federal, state,
local, employment and medicare taxes thereon (and any penalties and interest with respect thereto), the Employee retains
on an after tax basis a portion of such amount equal to the aggregate of (i) 100% of the portion of the Underpayment
attributable to the Payment, (ii) 100% of the portion of the Underpayment attributable to the Adjusted Gross Up
Payment and (iii) 100% of the Penalty Tax imposed on the Additional Gross Up Payment.</FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Termination for Cause</U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event of Termination for Cause, the Company shall have no further
obligation to the Employee under this Agreement after the Date of Termination other than deferred amounts under
Section 4(d).</FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Voluntary Termination</U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Employee may terminate his employment voluntarily at any time by
a notice pursuant to Section 8 of this Agreement.  In the event that the Employee voluntarily terminates his employment
other than by reason of any of the actions that constitute Involuntary Termination under Section 1(e)(ii) of this
Agreement ("Voluntary Termination"), the Company shall be obligated to the Employee for the amount of his Company
Salary and benefits only through the Date of Termination, at the time such payments are due, and the Company shall
have no further obligation to the Employee under this Agreement except as provided in Sections 4(d).</FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Death</U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event of the death of the Employee while employed  under this Agreement and prior
to any termination of employment, the Company shall pay to the Employee's estate, or such person as the Employee may
have previously designated in writing, (i) the Company Salary which was not previously paid to the Employee and the
Company Salary which he would have earned if he had continued to be employed under this Agreement through the
180th day after the date on which the Employee died; (ii) the amounts of any benefits or awards which, pursuant to the
terms of any applicable plan or plans, were earned with respect to the fiscal year in which the Employee died and which
the Employee would have been entitled to receive if he had continued to be employed, and the amount of any bonus or
incentive compensation for such fiscal year which the Employee would have been entitled to receive if he had continued
to be employed, pro-rated in accordance with the portion of the fiscal year prior to his death, <U>provided that</U> such amounts
shall be payable when and as ordinarily payable under the applicable plans; and (iii) the unpaid deferred amounts under
Section 4(d).    </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g)&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Permanent Disability</U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;For purposes of this Agreement, the term "permanently disabled" means
that the Employee has a mental or physical infirmity which permanently impairs his ability to perform substantially his<br>

<br><br>
<font size="-1"><center>5</center><a href="#6">NEXT PAGE</a></font><br><br><br><br>
<a name="6"></a>

duties and responsibilities under this Agreement and which results in (i) eligibility of the Employee under the long-term
disability plan of the Company or the Bank, if any; or (ii) inability of the Employee to perform substantially his duties
and responsibilities under this Agreement for a period of 180 consecutive days.  Either the Company or the Bank or both
may terminate the employment of the Employee after having established that the Employee is permanently disabled.</FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(h)&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Regulatory Action</U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement:</FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Employee is removed and/or permanently prohibited from participating in the
conduct of the affairs of a depository institution by an order issued under Section 8(e)(4) or (g)(1) of the Federal Deposit
Insurance Act ("FDIA"), 12 U.S.C. &#167 1818(e)(4) and (g)(1), all obligations of the Company under this Agreement shall
terminate as of the effective date of the order, but vested rights of the contracting parties shall not be affected; and</FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Bank is in default (as defined in Section 3(x)(1) of the FDIA), all obligations of
the Company under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date of default, but this provision shall not affect any vested
rights of the contracting parties; and</FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Notice of Termination</U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event that the Company or the Bank, or both, desire to terminate the
employment of the Employee during the term of this Agreement, the Company or the Bank, or both, shall deliver to the
Employee a written notice of termination, stating whether such termination constitutes Termination for Cause or
Involuntary Termination, setting forth in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances that are the basis for the
termination, and specifying the date upon which employment shall terminate, which date shall be at least 30 days after
the date upon which the notice is delivered, except in the case of Termination for Cause.  In the event that the Employee
determines in good faith that he has experienced an Involuntary Termination of his employment, he shall send a written
notice to the Company stating the circumstances that constitute such Involuntary Termination and the date upon which
his employment shall have ceased due to such Involuntary Termination.  In the event that the Employee desires to effect
a Voluntary Termination, he shall deliver a written notice to the Company, stating the date upon which employment shall
terminate, which date shall be at least 30 days after the date upon which the notice is delivered, unless the parties agree
to a date sooner.</FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9.&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Attorneys Fees</U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company shall pay all legal fees and related expenses (including the costs of experts,
evidence and counsel) incurred by the Employee as a result of (i) the Employee's contesting or disputing any termination
of employment, or (ii) the Employee's seeking to obtain or enforce any right or benefit provided by this Agreement or
by any other plan or arrangement maintained by the Company (or its successors) or the Consolidated Subsidiaries under
which the Employee is or may be entitled to receive benefits; <U>provided that</U> the Company's obligation to pay such fees
and expenses is subject to the Employee's prevailing with respect to the matters in dispute in any action initiated by the
Employee or the Employee's having been determined to have acted reasonably and in good faith with respect to any
action initiated by the Company or the Bank.</FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10.&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Non-Disclosure and Non-Solicitation</U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Non-Disclosure</U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Employee acknowledges that he has acquired, and will continue to
acquire while employed by the Company and/or any Consolidated Subsidiary, special knowledge of the business, affairs,
strategies and plans of the Company and the Consolidated Subsidiaries which has not been disclosed to the public and
which constitutes confidential and proprietary business information owned by the Company and the Consolidated
Subsidiaries, including but not limited to, information about the customers, customer lists, software, data, formulae,
processes, inventions, trade secrets, marketing information and plans, and business strategies of the Company and the
Consolidated Subsidiaries,  and other information about the products and services offered or developed or planned to
be offered or developed by the Company and/or the Consolidated Subsidiaries ("Confidential Information").   The
Employee agrees that, without the prior written consent of the Company, he shall not, during  the term of his
employment or at any time thereafter, in any manner directly or indirectly disclose any Confidential Information to any
person or entity other than the Company and the Consolidated Subsidiaries.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the
Employee is requested or required (including but not limited to by oral questions, interrogatories, requests for
information or documents in legal proceeding, subpoena, civil investigative demand or other similar process) to disclose
any Confidential Information the Employee shall provide the Company with prompt written notice of any such request
or requirement so that the Company and/or a Consolidated Subsidiary may seek a protective order or other appropriate<br>

<br><br>

remedy and/or waive compliance with the provisions of this Section 10(a). If, in the absence of a protective order or
other remedy or the receipt of a waiver from the Company, the Employee is nonetheless legally compelled to disclose
Confidential Information to any tribunal or else stand liable for contempt or suffer other censure or penalty, the
Employee may, without liability hereunder, disclose to such tribunal only that portion of the Confidential Information
which is legally required to be disclosed, provided that the Employee exercise his  best efforts to preserve the
confidentiality of the Confidential Information, including without limitation by cooperating with the Company and/or
a Consolidated Subsidiary to obtain an appropriate protective order or other reliable assurance that confidential treatment
will be accorded the Confidential Information by such tribunal.  On the Date of Termination, the Employee shall
promptly deliver to the Company all copies of documents or other records (including without limitation electronic
records) containing any Confidential Information that is in his possession or under his control, and shall retain no written
or electronic record of any Confidential Information.</FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Non-Solicitation</U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;During the three year period next following the Date of Termination, the
Employee shall not directly or indirectly solicit, encourage, or induce any person while employed by the Company or
any Consolidated Subsidiary to (i) leave the Company or any Consolidated Subsidiary, (ii) cease his or her employment
with the Company or any Consolidated Subsidiary or (iii) accept employment with another entity or person. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions of this Section 10 shall survive any termination of the Employee's employment and any
termination of this Agreement.</FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11.&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>No Assignments</U>.</FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;This Agreement is personal to each of the parties hereto, and neither party may assign or delegate
any of its rights or obligations hereunder without first obtaining the written consent of the other party; provided,
however, that the Company shall require any successor or assign (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger,
consolidation or otherwise) by an assumption agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the Employee, to
expressly assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company
would be required to perform it if no such succession or assignment had taken place.  Failure of the Company to obtain
such an assumption agreement prior to the effectiveness of any such succession or assignment shall be a breach of this
Agreement and shall entitle the Employee to compensation and benefits from the Company in the same amount and on
the same terms as provided for an Involuntary Termination under Section 7 hereof.  For purposes of implementing the
provisions of this Section 11(a), the date on which any such succession becomes effective shall be deemed the Date of
Termination.</FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;This Agreement and all rights of the Employee hereunder shall inure to the benefit of and be
enforceable by the Employee's personal and legal representatives, executors, administrators, successors, heirs,
distributees, devisees and legatees.  </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12.&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Notice</U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;For the purposes of this Agreement, notices and all other communications provided for in this
Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given when personally delivered or sent by
certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, to the Company at its home office, to the attention of the Board
of Directors with a copy to the Secretary of the Company, or, if to the Employee, to such home or other address as the
Employee has most recently provided in writing to the Company.</FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13.&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Amendments</U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;No amendments or additions to this Agreement shall be binding unless in writing and signed
by both parties, except as herein otherwise provided.</FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14.&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Headings</U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The headings used in this Agreement are included solely for convenience and shall not affect,
or be used in connection with, the interpretation of this Agreement.</FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15.&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Severability</U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed severable and the invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof.</FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16.&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Reinstatement of Prior Agreement</U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the
contrary, the parties hereto agree that in the event a Change in Control as described in Section 1(a)(6) occurs within one<br>

<br><br>
<font size="-1"><center>7</center><a href="#8">NEXT PAGE</a></font><br><br><br><br>
<a name="8"></a>

year from the date of this Agreement (not the Effective Date), then in that event the Prior Agreement shall be reinstated
and this Agreement shall become <U>void ab initio</U>.</FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17.&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Governing Law</U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Missouri.</FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18.&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Arbitration</U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Any dispute or controversy arising under or in connection with this Agreement (other than
relating to the enforcement of the provisions of Sections 7(e)(2) and 10) shall be settled exclusively by arbitration in
accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association then in effect.  Judgment may be entered on the
arbitrator's award in any court having jurisdiction.</FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;19.&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Equitable and Other Judicial Relief</U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event of an actual or threatened breach by the Employee of any
of the provisions of Section 7(e)(2) or 10, the Company shall be entitled to equitable relief in the form of an injunction
from a court of competent jurisdiction and such other equitable and legal relief as such court deems appropriate under
the circumstances.  The parties agree  that the Company shall not be required to post any bond in connection with the
grant or issuance of an injunction (preliminary, temporary and/or permanent) by a court of competent jurisdiction, and
if a bond is nevertheless required, the parties agree that it shall be in a nominal amount.  The parties further agree that
in the event of a breach by the Employee of any of the provisions of Section 7(e)(2) or 10, the Company will suffer
irreparable damage and its remedy at law against the Employee is inadequate to compensate it for such damage.</FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20.&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Satisfaction of the Company's Obligations by the Bank</U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;To the extent that the Bank or any other of the
Company's consolidated subsidiaries pays salary to the Employee or provides benefits to him which the Company is
obligated to pay or provide under this Agreement, the Company's obligations under this Agreement shall be deemed to
be satisfied.</FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Agreement as of the day and year first above written.</FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THIS AGREEMENT CONTAINS A BINDING ARBITRATION PROVISION WHICH MAY BE
ENFORCED BY THE PARTIES.</FONT></P>
