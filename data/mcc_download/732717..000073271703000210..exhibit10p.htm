Eligibility and Administration</FONT></H2>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><b>3.1      Eligibility</b>.  Persons eligible to participate in the Plan are limited to Non-Employee Directors.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><b>3.2      The Human Resources Committee</b>. The Plan shall be administered by the Human Resources Committee of the Board of Directors of
the Company, subject to the restrictions set forth in the Plan.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><B>3.3</B>
<B>Administration by the Committee</B>. The Committee shall have the full power,
discretion, and authority to interpret and administer the Plan in a manner
consistent with the Plan&#146;s provisions. However, in no event shall the
Committee have the power to determine Plan eligibility, or to determine the
number, the value, the vesting period, or the timing of Awards to be made under
the Plan (all such determinations being automatic pursuant to the provisions of
the Plan). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><B>3.4</B> <B>Decisions
Binding</B>. All determinations and decisions made by the Committee pursuant to
the Plan, and all related orders or resolutions of the Committee shall be final,
conclusive, and binding on all persons, including the Company, its shareholders,
Participants, and their estates and beneficiaries. </FONT></P>

<H2 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Article 4.
Payment of Annual Retainer</FONT></H2>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><B>4.1</B> <B>Form of
Annual Retainer</B>. In lieu of receiving the annual retainer (which term, as
used in this Plan, shall include any additional annual retainer for committee
chairman) in cash, effective for payments on or after January 1, 1998, a
Non-Employee Director may elect to receive all (100%) or fifty percent (50%) of
the Director&#146;s annual retainer in the form of Shares. Such election shall
be made prior to the beginning of, and will be effective for, the calendar year
in which the annual retainer will be paid. Each election shall become
irrevocable as of the last day such election may be made. Provided, however,
Non-Employee Directors not serving on the Board prior to January 1, 1998, may,
at any time within thirty (30) days of their original election to the Board,
make an irrevocable election with respect to payments not yet made, effective
for the then current calendar year. Unless the Non-Employee Director notifies
the Secretary of the Company otherwise prior to the beginning of each subsequent
calendar year, the election will renew automatically for an additional calendar
year. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><B>4.2</B> <B>Payment of
Shares</B>. One fourth of the annual retainer is paid in advance on the first
day of each quarter (if not a business day, then the next preceding business
day) and is fully earned on that date. A Director whose term will expire during
the quarter and who is not nominated for re-election will receive a pro-rated
quarterly retainer. For their first retainer payment only, newly elected
Non-Employee Directors are paid the first day of the quarter next occurring on a
pro-rata basis. When the retainer is increased after the first day of a calendar
quarter, the increased amount will be paid the first day of the following
quarter. Each fraction of a month is considered a whole month. The Shares paid
pursuant to Section 4.1 shall be delivered as soon as administratively possible
following the scheduled retainer payment date. The number of Shares to be paid
shall equal the portion of the quarterly retainer being taken in stock, divided
by the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of the scheduled payment of the
retainer. Any fractional Share shall be paid in cash as provided hereunder. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><B>4.3</B> <B>Holding
Period for Shares</B>. Any Shares acquired by a Director under this Article 4
may not be sold for one year after acquisition. Thereafter, such Shares shall
only be sold pursuant to an effective registration statement or pursuant to an
exemption from the Securities Act of 1933, including sales pursuant to Rule 144
thereunder. The Company may place a legend on the certificates for such Shares
evidencing this restriction. </FONT></P>

<H2 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Article 5.
Award of Stock Units for Non-Employee Directors</FONT></H2>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><B>5.1</B> <B>Award of Deferred
Stock Units for Non-Employee Directors</B>. Commencing November 21, 1997, and
then effective the day of each annual meeting of the Company&#146;s shareholders
thereafter, each Non-Employee Director shall be Awarded that number of Stock
Units that is equal to: (a) fifty percent (50%) of the annual retainer as in
effect at the time of the Award divided by (b) the Fair Market Value of a Share
on the date of the Award. Effective with the annual meeting in 2001, the
percentage in (a), above, shall be increased to one hundred fifty percent
(150%). Each Award is intended to be in consideration for service until the next
annual meeting of shareholders, but will be fully earned on the date of the
Award. Provided, however, if the Director terminates service on or before the
day of the annual meeting of shareholders, the Award to be paid on such meeting
date will not be issued. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><B>5.2</B> <B>Award of
Deferred Stock Units for New Non-Employee Directors</B>. The following applies
only to Non-Employee Directors who originally became a Non-Employee Director
after November 21, 1997. Each Non-Employee Director shall receive an annual
Award of Stock Units effective the day of the annual meeting of shareholders.
The number of Stock Units in each such Award shall equal thirteen thousand
dollars ($13,000), divided by the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of
the Award. Each Award is intended to be in consideration for service until the
next annual meeting of shareholders, but will be fully earned on the date of the
Award. If the Director terminates service on the day of the annual meeting of
shareholders, no such Award will be issued. No Director shall receive more than
ten (10) Awards under this Section 5.2. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><B>5.3</B> <B>Deferral of
Retainers and Fees into Stock Units</B>. Effective for payments on or after
January 1, 1998, each Non-Employee Director may elect to defer all (100%) or
fifty percent (50%) of the cash portion of the Director&#146;s annual retainer
into Stock Units. In addition, a Non-Employee Director may elect to defer all
(100%) of the Director&#146;s Board and committee meeting fees and review
session fees (collectively &#147;Fees&#148;) into Stock Units. The number of
Stock Units acquired shall equal the Fees and/or the portion of the annual
retainer being deferred into Stock Units, divided by the Fair Market Value of a
Share on the date of the scheduled payment of the Fees. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any
deferral election under this Section 5.3 shall be made prior to the beginning
of, and will be effective for, the calendar year in which such payments would
otherwise be made. Each such election shall become irrevocable as of the last
day such election may be made. Provided, however, Non-Employee Directors not
serving on the Board prior to January 1, 1998, may, at any time within thirty
(30) days of their original election to the Board, make an irrevocable election
with respect to payments not yet made, effective for the then current calendar
year. Unless the Non-Employee Director notifies the Secretary of the Company
otherwise prior to the beginning of each subsequent calendar year, each election
hereunder will renew automatically for an additional calendar year. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><B>5.4</B> <B>Payout of
Deferred Stock Units</B>. All Stock Units shall be paid out in the form of one
Share for each Stock Unit. The Participant shall elect the timing of the payout
for Stock Unit Awards no later than the calendar year prior to the first
scheduled payment of such Stock Units; any prior elections by the Participant
shall become irrevocable at that time. One election will apply to all Stock
Units, whether from deferrals, annual Awards or otherwise. Stock Units acquired
under this Plan shall be paid out in a lump sum payment or in up to fifteen (15)
annual installments, as elected by the Participant. The lump sum payment or the
first installment, as the case may be, shall be payable on the first day of
February of the year following the calendar year of the termination of the
Participant&#146;s service as a Director. All annual installments thereafter
shall be payable on the anniversary of the first such payment. If the Director
fails to make a timely election as to the number of installments, the Stock
Units shall be paid out in four (4) annual installments. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For
Participants electing a payout of Stock Units in installments, the number of
Stock Units to be paid out in each installment shall equal the number of Stock
Units available for payout, divided by the number of remaining installments
(including the installment being made). A fractional Stock Unit shall be paid in
cash. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><B>5.5</B> <B>Stock
Units</B>. Each Stock Unit shall represent an unfunded and unsecured promise by
SBC to issue a Share. On the record date for cash dividends payable on a Share,
Participants holding Stock Units shall earn dividend equivalents paid in the
form of additional Stock Units added to their account. The number of Stock Units
so added shall equal the dividends on an equal number of Shares, divided by the
Fair Market Value of a Share on the record date. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><B>5.6</B> <B>Holding
Period for Shares</B>. Any Shares acquired by a Director under this Article 5
may not be sold for one year after acquisition. Thereafter, such Shares shall
only be sold pursuant to an effective registration statement or pursuant to an
exemption from the Securities Act of 1933, including sales pursuant to Rule 144
thereunder. The Company may place a legend on the certificates for such Shares
evidencing this restriction. </FONT></P>

<H2 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Article 6.
Cash Deferral Account</FONT></H2>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><B>6.1</B> <B>Cash Deferral
Account</B>. A cash deferral account (the &#147;Cash Deferral Account&#148;)
shall be established and maintained by the Company for each Participant that
makes a cash deferral under the Plan. Each Cash Deferral Account shall be
credited as of the date the amount deferred otherwise would have become due and
payable to the Participant and shall be credited to reflect the interest return
thereon. The establishment and maintenance of such Cash Deferral Accounts,
however, shall not be construed as entitling any Participant to any specific
assets of the Company and shall represent an unfunded and unsecured promise of
the Company the amounts due thereunder. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><B>6.2</B> <B>Cash Deferral
Elections</B>. Effective for payments on or after January 1, 1998, each
Non-Employee Director may elect to defer all (100%) or fifty percent (50%) of
the cash portion of the Director&#146;s annual retainer into the Director&#146;s
Cash Deferral Account. In addition, a Non-Employee Director may elect to defer
all (100%) of the Director&#146;s Board and committee meeting fees and review
session fees (collectively &#147;Fees&#148;) into the Director&#146;s Cash
Deferral Account. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any
deferral election under this Section 6.2 shall be made prior to the beginning
of, and will be effective for, the calendar year in which such payments would
otherwise be made. Each such election shall become irrevocable as of the last
day such election may be made. Provided, however, Non-Employee Directors not
serving on the Board prior to January 1, 1998, may, at any time within thirty
(30) days of their original election to the Board, make an irrevocable election
with respect to payments not yet made, effective for the then current calendar
year. Unless the Non-Employee Director notifies the Secretary of the Company
otherwise prior to the beginning of each subsequent calendar year, each election
hereunder will renew automatically for an additional calendar year. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deferral
elections under the Plan made prior to November 21, 1997, shall remain in place
through the end of 1997, and all such deferrals shall be credited to the Cash
Deferral Account and continue to earn interest in accordance with Section 6.3.
Any new Non-Employee Director joining the Board after November 21, 1997, and
before January 1, 1998, may make an election with respect to 1997 annual
retainers and fees in accordance with the Plan as it read immediately prior to
the modifications of November 21, 1997. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><B>6.3</B> <B>Interest on
Cash Deferral Accounts</B>. The annual rate of interest on amounts in the Cash
Deferral Accounts for 1997 and subsequent calendar years shall be the
Moody&#146;s Corporate Bond Yield Average-Monthly Average Corporates as
published by Moody&#146;s Investor Service, Inc. (or any successor thereto) for
the month of September before the calendar year in question (if such yield is no
longer published, a substantially similar average selected by the Human
Resources Committee) or such other rate as the Human Resources Committee shall
determine prior to the year for which the interest rate would be applicable.
Interest shall be credited quarterly, in arrears. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><B>6.4</B> <B>Form and
Timing of Payout of Cash Deferral Accounts</B>. Cash Deferral Accounts shall be
paid out in cash. The Participant shall elect the timing of the payout for
Participant&#146;s Cash Deferral Account no later than the calendar year prior
to the first scheduled payment thereof; any prior elections by the Participant
shall become irrevocable at that time. One election shall apply to a
Participant&#146;s entire Cash Deferral Account. A Participant&#146;s Cash
Deferral Account shall be paid out in a lump sum payment or in up to fifteen
(15) annual installments, as elected by the Participant. The lump sum payment or
the first installment, as the case may be, shall be payable on the first day of
February of the year following the calendar year of the termination of the
Participant&#146;s service as a Director. All annual installments thereafter
shall be payable on the anniversary of the first such payment. If the Director
fails to make a timely election as to the number of installments, the
Participant&#146;s Cash Deferral Account shall be paid out in four (4) annual
installments. Each installment shall equal the amount available for payout,
divided by the number of remaining installments (including the installment being
made). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><B>6.5</B> <B>Conversion of
a Participant&#146;s Cash Deferral Account to Deferred Stock Units</B>. Each
year, on or before the tenth day following the Company&#146;s public release of
its annual summary statement of earnings (typically in January of each year)
(such tenth day to be the &#147;Conversion Date&#148;), a Non-Employee Director
may elect to convert all or part of the balance of his or her Cash Deferral
Account into Stock Units, effective the Conversion Date. Each such election
shall become irrevocable as of the last day such election may be made. A

Plan may be assigned by a Participant.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><B>8.4</B>
<B>Severability</B>. In the event any provision of the Plan shall be held
illegal or invalid for any reason, the illegality or invalidity shall not affect

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><B>8.5</B> <B>Death of a
Director/Beneficiary Designation</B>. Each Participant under the Plan may, from

the event of the death of a Participant before full payment of all amounts due
hereunder, the balance shall be paid in a lump sum as soon as administratively
possible in accordance with the foregoing. Notwithstanding this, if the

annual installments elected by the Participant, beginning on the first day of
the month following the Participant&#146;s death and occurring annually
