salary or wages and vacation accrued, unpaid and owed to Mr.&nbsp;Herman as of the
Effective Date, (ii)&nbsp;an amount equal to the salary or wages and vacation that
would have been paid or accrued had he remained employed from the Effective
Date through to the end of the month of December, and (iii)&nbsp;Mr.&nbsp;Herman will
receive notice of the right to continue Mr.&nbsp;Herman&#146;s existing health-insurance
coverage pursuant to COBRA.

this Agreement, Mr.&nbsp;Herman will be provided the following separation benefits:
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.<B> Lump-sum payment. </B>On the Effective Date, the Company will make a

the terms of such Program.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c.<B> Long-Term Incentive Program. </B>Upon the Effective Date, all unvested

ownership premiums provided to Mr.&nbsp;Herman under PG&#038;E Corporation&#146;s Performance
Unit Plan, Stock Option Plan, and Executive Stock Ownership Program will
continue to vest, terminate, or be canceled as provided under the terms of
their respective plans or program, as modified by the PG&#038;E Corporation Officer
Severance Policy in effect at the time this Agreement is signed by Mr.&nbsp;Herman.
The payment, exercise, and withdrawal of Mr.&nbsp;Herman&#146;s vested performance units,
stock option grants, and stock ownership premiums will be as provided under the
terms of their respective plans or program, provided that the performance units

or subsidiary are eligible for a payment under the Company&#146;s Short-Term
Incentive Plan (&#147;STIP&#148;) for the year in which the Effective Date occurs, the
Company will make the STIP payment that Mr.&nbsp;Herman would have received,
pro-rated to reflect the number of months from the beginning of the year to the
Effective Date. The STIP payment, if any, will be made at such time as STIP
payments are made to employees in Mr.&nbsp;Herman&#146;s funding unit or subsidiary. The
STIP Plan Administrator will have the sole discretion to determine the amount
of STIP payment, consistent with the program guidelines for the year in which
the Effective Date occurs.

18-<I>month </I>period commencing the first full month after the Effective Date and
until and unless Mr.&nbsp;Herman becomes covered under the health-insurance plan of
another employer. Mr.&nbsp;Herman will promptly notify the Company&#146;s Senior Human
Resources Officer if Mr.&nbsp;Herman becomes employed in any capacity within that
period.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.<B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Defense and indemnification in third-party claims. </B>The Company and/or
its parent, affiliate, or subsidiary will provide Mr.&nbsp;Herman with legal
representation and indemnification protection in any legal proceeding in which

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.<B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Release of claims and covenant not to sue.</B>
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Except for the obligations of this Agreement, in consideration of the
separation benefits and other benefits the Company is providing under this
Agreement, Mr.&nbsp;Herman, on behalf of Mr.&nbsp;Herman and Mr.&nbsp;Herman&#146;s
representatives, agents, heirs and assigns, waives, releases, discharges and
promises never to assert any and all claims, liabilities or obligations of
every kind and nature, whether known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected that
Mr.&nbsp;Herman ever had, now has or might have as of the Effective Date against the
Company or its predecessors, parent, affiliates, subsidiaries, shareholders,
owners, directors, officers, employees, agents, attorneys, successors, or
assigns. These released claims include, without limitation, any claims arising
from or related to Mr.&nbsp;Herman&#146;s employment with the Company, its parent or any
of its affiliates and subsidiaries, and the termination of that employment.
These released claims also specifically include, but are not limited, any
claims arising under any federal, state and local statutory or common law, such
as (as amended and as applicable) Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, the Age
Discrimination in Employment Act, the Americans With Disabilities Act, the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act, the Code of Maryland, Labor and
Employment, any other federal, state or local law governing the terms and
conditions of employment or the termination of employment, and the law of
contract and tort; and any claim for attorneys&#146; fees.

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. Mr.&nbsp;Herman acknowledges that there may exist facts or claims in
addition to or different from those which are now known or believed by Mr.
Herman to exist. Nonetheless, this Agreement extends to all claims of every
nature and kind whatsoever, whether known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected,
past or present.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. With respect to the claims released in the preceding paragraphs, Mr.
Herman will not initiate or maintain any legal or administrative action or
proceeding of any kind against the Company or its predecessors, parent,
affiliates, subsidiaries, shareholders, owners, directors, officers, employees,
agents, attorneys, successors, or assigns, for the purpose of obtaining any
personal relief, nor (except as otherwise required or permitted by law) assist
or participate in any such proceedings, including any proceedings brought by
any third parties.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.<B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Re-employment. </B>Mr.&nbsp;Herman will not seek any future re-employment with
the Company, its parent or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates. This
paragraph will not, however, preclude Mr.&nbsp;Herman from accepting an offer of
future employment from the Company, its parent or any of its subsidiaries or
affiliates.

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Mr.&nbsp;Herman will not disclose, publicize, or circulate to anyone in
whole or in part, any information concerning the existence, terms, and/or
conditions of this Agreement without the express written consent of the
Company&#146;s Chief Legal Officer unless otherwise required or permitted by law.
Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, Mr.&nbsp;Herman may disclose the terms and
conditions of this Agreement to Mr.&nbsp;Herman&#146;s family members, and any attorneys
or tax advisors, if any, to whom there is a <I>bona fide </I>need for disclosure in
order for them to render professional services to Mr.&nbsp;Herman, provided that the

confidential or proprietary information concerning the Company or its

Agreement and will be entitled to immediate return
of any and all amounts or benefits previously paid or provided to Mr.

entitlement without the additional credited service and/or age Mr.&nbsp;Herman
received or would have received under this Agreement. Despite any breach by
Mr.&nbsp;Herman, Mr.&nbsp;Herman&#146;s other duties and obligations under this Agreement,
including Mr.&nbsp;Herman&#146;s waivers and releases, will remain in full force and

the provisions in paragraphs 4, 5, 6, 7, and/or 8, the Company will, in
addition to any other remedies provided in this Agreement, be entitled to
equitable and/or injunctive relief and, because the damages for such a breach
or threatened breach will be difficult to determine and will not provide a full
and adequate remedy, the Company will also be entitled to specific performance
by Mr.&nbsp;Herman of Mr.&nbsp;Herman&#146;s obligations under paragraphs 4, 5, 6, 7, and/or
8. Pursuant to paragraph 14, and except as otherwise prohibited or limited by

the Company, including any unexcused late or non-payment of any amounts owed
under this Agreement, or any unexcused failure to provide any other benefits
specified in this Agreement. In the event of a breach or threatened breach by
the Company of any of its material obligations to Mr.&nbsp;Herman under this
Agreement, Mr.&nbsp;Herman will be entitled to seek, in addition to any other
remedies provided in this Agreement, specific performance of the Company&#146;s
obligations and any other applicable equitable or injunctive relief. Pursuant

employment with the Company (or with the employing subsidiary), the separation
of Mr.&nbsp;Herman from that employment and from Mr.&nbsp;Herman&#146;s positions as an
officer and/or director of the Company or any subsidiary or affiliate, or any
claims for benefits, will be resolved exclusively by final and binding
arbitration using a three-member arbitration panel in accordance with the
Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association currently
in effect, provided, however, that in rendering their award, the arbitrators
will be limited to accepting the position of Mr.&nbsp;Herman or the Company. The
only claims not covered by this paragraph are any non-waivable claims for
benefits under workers&#146; compensation or unemployment insurance laws, which will
be resolved under those laws. Any arbitration pursuant to this paragraph will
take place in Bethesda, Maryland. The Parties may be represented by legal
counsel at the arbitration but must bear their own fees for such representation
in the first instance. The prevailing party in any dispute or controversy
covered by this paragraph, or with respect to any request for specific
performance, injunctive or other equitable relief, will be entitled to recover,
in addition to any other available remedies specified in this Agreement, all
litigation expenses and costs, including any arbitrator, administrative or
filing fees and reasonable attorneys&#146; fees, except as prohibited or limited by
law. The Parties specifically waive any right to a jury trial on any dispute
or controversy covered by this paragraph. Judgment may be entered on the
arbitrators&#146; award in any court of competent jurisdiction. Subject to the
arbitration provisions of this paragraph, the sole jurisdiction and venue for
any action related to the subject matter of this Agreement will be the Maryland
state and federal courts having within their jurisdiction the location of the
Company&#146;s principal place of business in Maryland at the time of such action,
and both Parties hereby consent to the jurisdiction of such courts for any such
action.

the laws of the State of Maryland, without regard to their conflicts of laws
provisions.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16<B>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No waiver. </B>The failure of either Party to exercise or enforce, at any
time, or for any period of time, any of the provisions of this Agreement will
not be construed as a waiver of that provision, or any portion of that
provision, and will in no way affect that party&#146;s right to exercise or enforce
such provisions. No waiver or default of any provision of this Agreement will
be deemed to be a waiver of any succeeding breach of the same or any other
provisions of this Agreement.

</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Mr.&nbsp;Herman was provided up to 21&nbsp;days to consider and accept the terms
of this Agreement and was advised to consult with an attorney about the
Agreement before signing it. After reviewing an earlier draft of the
Agreement, Mr.&nbsp;Herman requested certain modifications to the Agreement which
were accepted and are reflected in this Agreement. Although based on those
modifications, Mr.&nbsp;Herman may have been entitled to another 21-day period in
which to consider and accept the terms of this Agreement, Mr.&nbsp;Herman elected to
waive any applicable new 21-day period. After signing the Agreement, Mr.
Herman will have an additional seven (7)&nbsp;days in which to revoke in writing
acceptance of this Agreement. To revoke, Mr.&nbsp;Herman will submit a signed
statement to that effect to the Company&#146;s Senior Human Resources Officer before
the close of business on the seventh day. If Mr.&nbsp;Herman does not submit a
timely revocation, the Effective Date of this Agreement will be the eighth day
after Mr.&nbsp;Herman signs it, at which time the Company shall wire transfer the
payments set forth in paragraphs 2 (a)&nbsp;and 2 (b), above.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. Mr.&nbsp;Herman acknowledges reading and understanding the contents of this
Agreement, being afforded the opportunity to review carefully this Agreement
with an attorney of Mr.&nbsp;Herman&#146;s choice, not relying on any oral or written
representation not contained in this Agreement, signing this Agreement
knowingly and voluntarily, and, after the Effective Date of this Agreement,
being bound by all of its provisions.
