for oversight of the quality and integrity of the accounting, auditing and reporting practices of Chiron and its subsidiaries, and such other duties as directed by the Board. The Committee's role
includes oversight of Chiron's internal audit function and its business ethics standards and compliance. The Committee's role also includes a particular focus on the qualitative aspects of financial
reporting to shareholders, and on Chiron's processes to manage business and financial risk and processes to assure compliance with significant applicable legal, ethical and regulatory requirements.
The Committee is directly responsible for the appointment, compensation, retention and oversight of the work of Chiron's independent auditors, including resolving disagreements between management and
the independent auditors regarding financial reporting. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except
to the extent otherwise directed by the Board or required by applicable law or Chiron's Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws, this Committee shall have the full authority of the
Board over any matter with respect to which oversight or direction is required to be exercised solely by directors who satisfy the independence criteria specified in this charter for membership on
this Committee. The chairperson of the Committee, acting in consultation with all committee members who are not otherwise affected by the issue or interest under consideration, and in consultation
with such other directors, representatives of management, counsel or other advisors as the chairperson may deem appropriate, may determine from time to time the scope of the Committee's authority
under this charter. </FONT></P>

the Board, would interfere with his or her individual exercise of independent judgment and each member shall otherwise be "independent" and qualified to serve as a member of the Committee under

pleasure of the Board. The chairperson shall be appointed by the full Board. </FONT></P>
