<P><FONT FACE="Courier New"><STRONG>Vancouver, B.C. (February 25, 2003)</STRONG> - Atna Resources Ltd.
(TSX:ATN) is pleased to announce that it has optioned the
Clover gold prospect, located in the Midas district of North
Central Nevada.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Courier New">Clover is a high-grade vein-hosted epithermal gold prospect, in
a similar geologic setting to Newmont Mining's Ken Snyder mine
<STRONG>(2.7 million tons averaging 1.12 oz/ton gold, and 12.82 oz/ton
silver) </STRONG>which is located approximately 17 km west of the
property.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Courier New">Clover is situated along the northern margin of the Midas
trough, along the southwest flank of the Snowstorm Mountains.
Drilling by previous operators intersected mineralized banded
quartz-adularia veins and breccia fillings, with significant
intercepts including: <STRONG>32 feet grading 0.74 oz/ton Au, 2.5 feet
grading 8.0 oz/ton Au, 25 feet of 0.23 oz/ton Au, and 5 feet
grading 0.53 oz/ton Au</STRONG>. Mineralization occurs within two zones
that are largely open along strike and down-dip, associated
with north-northwest and east-northeast striking structures.
High-grade float boulders grading up to 0.93 oz/ton Au and 9.0
oz/ton Ag in grab samples, were discovered approximately two
miles north-northwest of this drilling.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Courier New">Mid-Miocene aged bi-modal volcanic rocks on the western margin
of the Northern Nevada rift underlie the property. These rocks
are the stratigraphic equivalents to the units that host
bonanza veins in the Midas district. Altered rhyolitic
volcaniclastic rocks exposed throughout the property contain
widespread anomalous gold (20-70 ppb).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Courier New">Atna plans to drill the property in April 2003, targeting
extensions of known mineralization. The system will also be
tested at depth, where continuity in grade and structure may
occur, as it does at the nearby Ken Snyder deposit.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Courier New">Under terms of the option agreement, Atna may acquire a 100%
interest in the Clover property by paying US$20,000 on signing,
US$25,000 on the 1<SUP>st</SUP> anniversary and US$30,000 on each
subsequent anniversary until the vendor receives cumulative
total payments of US$300,000. The vendor retains a 3% NSR, Atna
has the right to buy back the royalty for US$1,000,000 per 1%
interest.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Courier New">Clover is a high grade prospect with drill ready targets that
augments Atna's portfolio of gold properties in one of the
world's premier gold mining districts. An aggressive strategy
of exploration and drilling will be executed over the next six
months.</FONT></P>
