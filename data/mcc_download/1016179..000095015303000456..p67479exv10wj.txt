                            364-DAY CREDIT AGREEMENT

         THIS 364-DAY CREDIT AGREEMENT dated as of March 27, 2002 (the "Credit
Agreement"), is by and among THE DIAL CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation (the
"Borrower"), certain Domestic Subsidiaries of the Borrower listed on the
signature pages hereto and as may from time to time become a party hereto
(collectively the "Guarantors" and individually, a "Guarantor"), the lenders
named herein and such other lenders as may become a party hereto (the "Lenders"
and individually, a "Lender"), FIRST UNION NATIONAL BANK, as Administrative
Agent for the Lenders (in such capacity, the "Administrative Agent"), BANK OF
AMERICA, N.A., as Syndication Agent for the Lenders, and BANK ONE, NA and CREDIT
LYONNAIS LOS ANGELES BRANCH, as Co-Documentation Agents for the Lenders.

                                   WITNESSETH

         WHEREAS, the Borrower has requested that the Lenders provide a $75
million credit facility for the purposes hereinafter set forth; and

         WHEREAS, the Lenders have agreed to make the requested credit facility
available to the Borrower on the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth.

         NOW, THEREFORE, IN CONSIDERATION of the premises and other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

                                    SECTION 1
                                   DEFINITIONS

         1.1      Definitions.

         As used in this Credit Agreement, the following terms shall have the
meanings specified below unless the context otherwise requires:

         "Account Designation Letter" means the Notice of Account Designation
Letter dated the Closing Date from the Borrower to the Administrative Agent in
substantially the form attached hereto as Schedule 1.1-1.

         "Additional Commitment" means, with respect to any Lender which
executes a New Commitment Agreement in accordance with Section 3.4(c), the
commitment of such Lender in an aggregate principal amount up to the amount
specified in such New Commitment Agreement to make Revolving Loans in accordance
with the provisions of Section 2.1.

         "Administrative Agent" shall have the meaning assigned to such term in
the first paragraph hereof, together with any successors or assigns.

                                       1

<PAGE>

         "Administrative Agent's Fees" shall have the meaning assigned to such
term in Section 3.5(c).

         "Affiliate" means as to any Person, any other Person which, directly or
indirectly, is in control of, is controlled by, or is under common control with,
such Person. For purposes of this definition, a Person shall be deemed to be
"controlled by" a Person if such Person possesses, directly or indirectly, power
either (a) to vote 20% or more of the securities having ordinary voting power
for the election of directors of such Person or (b) to direct or cause the
direction of the management and policies of such Person whether by contract or
otherwise.

         "Aggregate Commitment" means, for any Utilization Period, the sum of
the Aggregate Revolving Committed Amount under this Credit Agreement and the
commitments under the Three Year Credit Agreement.

         "Aggregate Revolving Committed Amount" means the aggregate amount of
Commitments in effect from time to time, being initially SEVENTY FIVE MILLION
DOLLARS ($75,000,000), and as such aggregate amount may be increased or reduced
from time to time as provided in Sections 2.1(h) and 3.4.

         "Alternate Base Rate" means, for any day, the rate per annum (rounded
upwards, if necessary, to the nearest whole multiple of 1/100 of 1%) equal to
the greater of (a) the Federal Funds Rate in effect on such day plus 1/2 of 1%
or (b) the Prime Rate in effect on such day. If for any reason the
Administrative Agent shall have reasonably determined (which determination shall
be conclusive absent manifest error) that it is unable after due inquiry to
ascertain the Federal Funds Rate for any reason, including the inability or
failure of the Administrative Agent to obtain sufficient quotations in
accordance with the terms hereof, the Alternate Base Rate shall be determined
without regard to clause (a) of the first sentence of this definition until the
circumstances giving rise to such inability no longer exist. Any change in the
Alternate Base Rate due to a change in the Prime Rate or the Federal Funds Rate
shall be effective on the effective date of such change in the Prime Rate or the
Federal Funds Rate, respectively.

         "Alternate Base Rate Loans" means Loans that bear interest at an
interest rate based on the Alternate Base Rate.

         "Applicable Percentage" means for any day, the rate per annum set forth
below opposite the applicable rating for the Borrower's senior unsecured
(non-credit enhanced) long term debt as determined by S&P and Moody's (the "Debt
Rating") then in effect, it being understood that the Applicable Percentage for
(i) Alternate Base Rate Loans shall be the percentage set forth under the column
"Alternate Base Rate Margin", (ii) LIBOR Rate Loans shall be the percentage set
forth under the column "LIBOR Margin", (iii) the Facility Fee shall be the
percentage set forth under the column "Facility Fee" and (iv) the Utilization
Fee shall be the percentage set forth under the column "Utilization Fee":

to each Lender individually, the aggregate principal amount of such Lender's
Commitment Percentage of Revolving Loans outstanding at any time shall not
exceed such Lender's Revolving Committed Amount. Revolving Loans may consist of
Alternate Base Rate

                                       20

<PAGE>

Loans or LIBOR Rate Loans, or a combination thereof, as the Borrower may
request, and may be repaid and reborrowed in accordance with the provisions
hereof.

         (b)      Revolving Loan Borrowings.

                  (i)      Notice of Borrowing. The Borrower shall request a
         Revolving Loan borrowing by written notice (or telephone notice
         promptly confirmed in writing) to the Administrative Agent not later
         than 11:00 A.M. on the day of the requested borrowing, which shall be a
         Business Day, in the case of Alternate Base Rate Loans, and on the
         third Business Day prior to the date of the requested borrowing in the
         case of LIBOR Rate Loans. Each such request for borrowing shall be
         irrevocable and shall specify (A) that a Revolving Loan is requested,
         (B) the date of the requested borrowing (which shall be a Business
         Day), (C) the aggregate principal amount to be borrowed, and (D)
         whether the borrowing shall be comprised of Alternate Base Rate Loans,
         LIBOR Rate Loans or a combination thereof, and if LIBOR Rate Loans are
         requested, the Interest Period(s) therefor. If the Borrower shall fail
         to specify in any such Notice of Borrowing (I) an applicable Interest
         Period in the case of a LIBOR Rate Loan, then such notice shall be
         deemed to be a request for an Interest Period of one month, or (II) the
         type of Revolving Loan requested, then such notice shall be deemed to
         be a request for a Alternate Base Rate Loan hereunder. The
         Administrative Agent shall give notice to each Lender promptly upon
         receipt of each Notice of Borrowing pursuant to this Section 2.1(b)(i),
         the contents thereof and each such Lender's share of any borrowing to
         be made pursuant thereto.

                  (ii)     Minimum Amounts. Each Revolving Loan shall be in a
         minimum aggregate principal amount of (A) in the case of LIBOR Rate
         Loans, $5,000,000 and integral multiples of $1,000,000 in excess
         thereof (or the remaining amount of the Revolving Committed Amount, if
         less) or (B) in the case of Alternate Base Rate Loans, $1,000,000 and
         integral multiples of $1,000,000 in excess thereof (or the remaining
         amount of the Revolving Committed Amount, if less).

                  (iii)    Advances. Each Lender will make its Commitment
         Percentage of each Revolving Loan borrowing available to the
         Administrative Agent for the account of the Borrower at the office of
         the Administrative Agent specified in Section 10.2, or at such office
         as the Administrative Agent may designate in writing, by 1:00 p.m. on
         the date specified in the applicable Notice of Borrowing in Dollars and
         in funds immediately available to the Administrative Agent. Such
         borrowing will then be made available to the Borrower by the
         Administrative Agent by crediting the account designated by the
         Borrower with the aggregate of the amounts made available to the
         Administrative Agent by the Lenders and in like funds as received by
         the Administrative Agent.

         (c)      Repayment.  The principal amount of all Loans shall be due and
payable in full on the Termination Date.

                                       21

<PAGE>

         (d)      Interest.  Subject to the provisions of Section 3.1:

                  (i)      Alternate Base Rate Loans. During such periods as
         Revolving Loans shall be comprised in whole or in part of Alternate
         Base Rate Loans, such Alternate Base Rate Loans shall bear interest at
         a per annum rate equal to the Alternate Base Rate plus the Applicable
         Percentage;

                  (ii)     LIBOR Rate Loans. During such periods as Revolving
         Loans shall be comprised in whole or in part of LIBOR Rate Loans, such
         LIBOR Rate Loans shall bear interest at a per annum rate equal to the
         LIBOR Rate plus the Applicable Percentage.

Interest on Revolving Loans shall be payable in arrears on each applicable
Interest Payment Date (or at such other times as may be specified herein).

         (e)      Revolving Notes. The Revolving Loans shall be evidenced by a
duly executed Revolving Note in favor of each Lender in the form of Schedule
2.1(e) attached hereto.

         (f)      Maximum Number of LIBOR Rate Loans. The Borrower will be
limited to a maximum number of eight (8) LIBOR Rate Loans outstanding at any
time. For purposes hereof, LIBOR Rate Loans with separate or different Interest
Periods will be considered as separate LIBOR Rate Loans even if their Interest
Periods expire on the same date.

         (g)      Extension of Termination Date. The Borrower may, within 90
days, but not less than 60 days, prior to the then applicable Termination Date,
by notice to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, make written request of
the Lenders to extend the then applicable Termination Date for an additional
period of 364 days (the "Extension Request"). Each Lender shall make a
determination not later than 30 days following receipt of the Extension Request
(the date that is 30 days following the date the Extension Request is received
shall be the "Extension Consent Date") as to whether or not it will agree to
extend the Termination Date as requested (such approval of an extension shall be
an "Extension Consent"); provided, however, that failure by any Lender to make a
timely response to the Borrower's request for extension of the Termination Date
shall be deemed to constitute a refusal by such Lender to extend the Termination
Date.

         (h)      Lender Not Consenting. If by any Extension Consent Date the
Borrower and the Administrative Agent have not received an Extension Consent
from any Lender, the Termination Date, as it relates to such Lender, shall not
be extended, the Commitment of such Lender shall terminate on the Termination
Date applicable to it and any Loans made by such Lender, all accrued and unpaid
interest thereon and all other amounts due under this Credit Agreement to such
Lender shall be due and payable on the Termination Date applicable to it. Upon
the termination of the Commitment of any such Lender, unless this Credit
Agreement is amended as provided in Sections 2.1(j) or 2.1(k), the Aggregate
Revolving Committed Amount shall be reduced by the amount of such terminated
Commitment, and the Commitment Percentage of each other Lender shall be adjusted
to that percentage obtained by dividing the Commitment of such Lender by the
Aggregate Revolving Committed Amount after giving effect to such reduction.

                                       22

<PAGE>

         (i)      Other Lenders. No refusal by any one Lender to consent to any
extension of the Termination Date shall affect the extension of the Termination
Date as it may relate to the Commitment and Loans of any Lender which consents
to such extension as provided in Section 2.1(g), and one or more Lenders may
consent to the extension of the Termination Date as it relates to them
notwithstanding any refusal by any other Lenders so to consent; provided that
even as to the consenting Lenders the Termination Date will be extended only
upon consent to such an extension by Lenders holding more than 51% of the
Aggregate Revolving Committed Amount.

         (j)      Increase in Commitment of Other Lender or Lenders. If any
Lender does not deliver an Extension Consent as provided in Section 2.1(g), the
Borrower may offer each Lender which has delivered an Extension Consent as
provided in Section 2.1(g) a reasonable opportunity to increase its Commitment
by an amount equal to its pro-rata share (based on its Commitment before such
increase) of the Commitment of the Lender which does not deliver an Extension
Consent as provided in Section 2.1(g). After giving such Lenders such an
opportunity, the Borrower may, with the approval of the Administrative Agent,
amend this Credit Agreement to increase the Commitment of any other Lender or
Lenders with the consent of such Lender or Lenders provided that such increase
does not increase the Aggregate Revolving Committed Amount to an amount greater
than the Aggregate Revolving Committed Amount in effect immediately before such
expiration or termination.

         (k)      Additional Lender or Lenders. If any Lender does not deliver
an Extension Consent as provided in Section 2.1(g), upon the expiration of the
Commitment of such Lender, the Borrower may, with the approval of the
Administrative Agent, amend this Credit Agreement as provided in Section 10.6 to
add one or more other Lenders as parties, with such Commitment or Commitments as
may be agreed to by the Administrative Agent and such other Lender or Lenders,
provided that such additions do not increase the Aggregate Revolving Committed
Amount to an amount greater than the Aggregate Revolving Committed Amount in
effect immediately before such expiration or termination.

         (l)      Notice. The Administrative Agent shall promptly provide each
of the Lenders with a copy of any amendment made pursuant to Section 2.1(j) or
Section 2.1(k).

                                    SECTION 3
                 OTHER PROVISIONS RELATING TO CREDIT FACILITIES

         3.1      Default Rate.

         Upon the occurrence, and during the continuance, of an Event of
Default, the principal of and, to the extent permitted by law, interest on the
Loans and any other amounts owing hereunder or under the other Credit Documents
shall bear interest, payable on demand, at a per annum rate 2% greater than the
interest rate which would otherwise be applicable (or if no rate is applicable,
whether in respect of interest, fees or other amounts, then 2% greater than the
Alternate Base Rate plus the Applicable Percentage).

                                       23

<PAGE>

         3.2      Extension and Conversion.

         The Borrower shall have the option, on any Business Day, to extend
existing Loans into a subsequent permissible Interest Period or to convert Loans
into Loans of another interest rate type; provided, however, that (i) except as
expressly provided otherwise in this Credit Agreement, LIBOR Rate Loans may be
converted into Alternate Base Rate Loans only on the last day of the Interest
Period applicable thereto, (ii) LIBOR Rate Loans may be extended, and Alternate
Base Rate Loans may be converted into LIBOR Rate Loans, only if the conditions
in Section 4.2 have been satisfied, (iii) Loans extended as, or converted into,
LIBOR Rate Loans shall be subject to the terms of the definition of "Interest
Period" set forth in Section 1.1 and shall be in such minimum amounts as
provided in Section 2.1(b)(ii), and (iv) any request for extension or conversion
of a LIBOR Rate Loan which shall fail to specify an Interest Period shall be
deemed to be a request for an Interest Period of one month. Each such extension
or conversion shall be effected by the Borrower by giving a Notice of
Extension/Conversion (or telephone notice promptly confirmed in writing) to the
Administrative Agent prior to 11:00 A.M. on the Business Day of, in the case of
the conversion of a LIBOR Rate Loan into a Alternate Base Rate Loan, and on the
third Business Day prior to, in the case of the extension of a LIBOR Rate Loan
as, or conversion of a Alternate Base Rate Loan into, a LIBOR Rate Loan, the
date of the proposed extension or conversion, specifying (A) the date of the
proposed extension or conversion, (B) the Loans to be so extended or converted,
(C) the types of Loans into which such Loans are to be converted and, if
appropriate, (D) the applicable Interest Periods with respect thereto. Each
request for extension or conversion shall be irrevocable and shall constitute a
representation and warranty by the Borrower of the matters specified in Section
4.2. In the event the Borrower fails to request extension or conversion of any
LIBOR Rate Loan in accordance with this Section, or any such conversion or
extension is not permitted or required by this Section, then such LIBOR Rate
Loan shall be continued as a LIBOR Rate Loan at the end of the Interest Period
applicable thereto for an Interest Period of one month. The Administrative Agent
shall give each Lender notice as promptly as practicable of any such proposed
extension or conversion affecting any Loan.

         3.3      Prepayments.

         (a)      Voluntary Prepayments. Revolving Loans may be repaid in whole
or in part without premium or penalty; provided that (i) LIBOR Rate Loans may be
prepaid only upon three (3) Business Days' prior written notice to the
Administrative Agent, and Alternate Base Rate Loans may be prepaid only upon at
least one (1) Business Day's prior written notice to the Administrative Agent,
(ii) prepayments of LIBOR Rate Loans must be accompanied by payment of any
amounts owing under Section 3.12, and (iii) partial prepayments shall be in
minimum principal amount of $10,000,000, and in integral multiples of $1,000,000
in excess thereof.

         (b)      Mandatory Prepayments. If at any time, the aggregate principal
amount of Loans shall exceed the Aggregate Revolving Committed Amount, the
Borrower shall immediately make payment on the Loans in an amount sufficient to
eliminate the deficiency.

                                       24

<PAGE>

         (c)      Application. Unless otherwise specified by the Borrower,
prepayments made hereunder shall be applied first to Alternate Base Rate Loans
and then to LIBOR Rate Loans in direct order of Interest Period maturities.
Amounts prepaid hereunder may be reborrowed in accordance with the provisions
hereof.

         3.4      Termination, Reduction and Increase of Commitments

         (a)      Voluntary Reductions. The Commitments may be terminated or
permanently reduced by the Borrower in whole or in part upon three (3) Business
Days' prior written notice to the Administrative Agent; provided that (i) after
giving effect to any voluntary reduction, the aggregate principal amount of
Loans shall not exceed the Aggregate Revolving Committed Amount, as reduced, and
(ii) partial reductions shall be in minimum principal amounts of $10,000,000,
and in integral multiples of $1,000,000 in excess thereof.

         (b)      Mandatory Reduction. The Commitments hereunder shall terminate
on the Termination Date.

         (c)      Increase in Commitments. The Borrower shall have the right
upon at least fifteen (15) Business Days' prior written notice to the
Administrative Agent to increase the Aggregate Revolving Committed Amount by up
to $25,000,000, in a single increase, at any time on or after the Closing Date,
subject, however, in any such case, to satisfaction of the following conditions
precedent:

                  (i)      no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred
         and be continuing on the date on which such Aggregate Revolving
         Committed Amount increase is to become effective;

                  (ii)     the representations and warranties set forth in
         Section 5 of this Credit Agreement shall be true and correct in all
         material respects on and as of the date on which such Aggregate
         Revolving Committed Amount increase is to become effective (except to
         the extent they expressly relate to an earlier date);

                  (iii)    on or before the date on which such Aggregate
         Revolving Committed Amount increase is to become effective, the
         Administrative Agent shall have received, for its own account, the
         mutually acceptable fees and expenses required by separate agreement of
         the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to be paid in connection with
         such increase;

                  (iv)     such Aggregate Revolving Committed Amount increase
         shall be an integral multiple of $5,000,000 and shall in no event be
         less than $5,000,000; and

                  (v)      such requested Aggregate Revolving Commitment
         increase shall be effective on such date only to the extent that, on or
         before such date, (A) the Administrative Agent shall have received and
         accepted a corresponding amount of Additional Commitment(s) pursuant to
         a commitment letter(s) acceptable to the Administrative Agent from one
         or more Lenders acceptable to the Administrative Agent

                                       25

<PAGE>

         and, with respect to any Lender that is not at such time a Lender
         hereunder, to the Borrower and (B) each such Lender has executed an
         agreement in the form of Schedule 3.4(c) hereto (each such agreement a
         "New Commitment Agreement"), accepted in writing therein by the
         Administrative Agent and, with respect to any Lender that is not at
         such time a Lender hereunder, by the Borrower, with respect to the
         Additional Commitment of such Lender.

         3.5      Fees.

         (a)      Facility Fee. In consideration of the Commitments hereunder,
the Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the ratable benefit
of the Lenders a facility fee (the "Facility Fee") equal to the Applicable
Percentage per annum, prior to the Termination Date, on the average daily
Aggregate Revolving Committed Amount in effect from time to time, and after the
Termination Date, on the average daily aggregate Revolving Loans outstanding.
The Facility Fee shall be payable quarterly in arrears on the 15th day following
the last day of each calendar quarter for the immediately preceding quarter (or
portion thereof) beginning with the first such date to occur after the Closing
Date and on the Termination Date.

         (b)      Utilization Fee. For each day that the principal amount of
outstanding Loans hereunder is equal to or shall exceed an amount equal to fifty
percent (50%) of the then Aggregate Revolving Committed Amount, the Borrower
shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the pro rata benefit of the Lenders, a
per annum fee equal to one-eighth of one percent (.125%) on the Utilized
Commitment for such day (the "Utilization Fees"). The Utilization Fees, if any,
shall be due and payable in arrears on the first Business Day after the end of
each fiscal quarter of the Borrower (as well as on the Termination Date and on
any date that the Commitment is reduced) for the immediately preceding fiscal
quarter (or portion thereof), beginning with the first of such dates to occur
after the Closing Date.

         (c)      Administrative Agent's Fees. The Borrower agrees to pay to the
Administrative Agent, for its own account, an annual administrative fee and such
other fees, if any, referred to in the Fee Letter (collectively, the
"Administrative Agent's Fees").

         3.6      Computation of Interest and Fees.

                  (a)      Interest payable hereunder with respect to Alternate
         Base Rate Loans based on the Prime Rate shall be calculated on the
         basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days, as applicable) for the actual
         days elapsed. All other fees, interest and all other amounts payable
         hereunder shall be calculated on the basis of a 360 day year for the
         actual days elapsed. The Administrative Agent shall as soon as
         practicable notify the Borrower and the Lenders of each determination
         of a LIBOR Rate on the Business Day of the determination thereof. Any
         change in the interest rate on a Loan resulting from a change in the
         Alternate Base Rate shall become effective as of the opening of
         business on the day on which such change in the Alternate Base Rate
         shall become effective. The Administrative Agent shall as soon as
         practicable notify the Borrower and the Lenders of the effective date
         and the amount of each such change.

                                       26

<PAGE>

                  (b)      Each determination of an interest rate by the
         Administrative Agent pursuant to any provision of this Credit Agreement
         shall be conclusive and binding on the Borrower and the Lenders in the
         absence of manifest error. The Administrative Agent shall, at the
         request of the Borrower, deliver to the Borrower a statement showing
         the computations used by the Administrative Agent in determining any
         interest rate.

                  3.7      Pro Rata Treatment and Payments.

                  (a)      Each borrowing of Revolving Loans and any reduction
         of the Commitments shall be made pro rata according to the respective
         Commitment Percentages of the Lenders. Each payment under this Credit
         Agreement or any Note shall be applied (i) first, to any Fees then due
         and owing, (ii) second, to interest then due and owing in respect of
         the Notes of the Borrower and (iii) third, to principal then due and
         owing hereunder and under the Notes of the Borrower. Each payment on
         account of any Fees pursuant to Sections 3.5(a) and (b) shall be made
         pro rata in accordance with the respective amounts due and owing. Each
         payment (other than prepayments) by the Borrower on account of
         principal of and interest on the Revolving Loans shall be made pro rata
         according to the respective amounts due and owing hereunder.
         Prepayments made pursuant to Section 3.3 shall be applied in accordance
         with such section. Each optional prepayment on account of principal of
         the Loans shall be applied in accordance with Section 3.3 and each
         mandatory prepayment on account of principal of the Loans shall be
         applied in accordance with Section 3.3. All payments (including
         prepayments) to be made by the Borrower on account of principal,
         interest and fees shall be made without defense, set-off or
         counterclaim (except as provided in Section 3.13(b)) and shall be made
         to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders at the
         Administrative Agent's office specified in Section 10.2 in Dollars and
         in immediately available funds not later than 1:00 P.M. on the date
         when due. The Administrative Agent shall distribute such payments to
         the Lenders entitled thereto promptly upon receipt in like funds as
         received. If any payment hereunder (other than payments on the LIBOR
         Rate Loans) becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day,
         such payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day,
         and, with respect to payments of principal, interest thereon shall be
         payable at the then applicable rate during such extension. If any
         payment on a LIBOR Rate Loan becomes due and payable on a day other
         than a Business Day, the maturity thereof shall be extended to the next
         succeeding Business Day unless the result of such extension would be to
         extend such payment into another calendar month, in which event such
         payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day.

                  (b)      Allocation of Payments After Event of Default.
         Notwithstanding any other provision of this Credit Agreement to the
         contrary, after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event
         of Default, all amounts collected or received by the Administrative
         Agent or any Lender on account of the Credit Party Obligations or any
         other amounts outstanding under any of the Credit Documents shall be
         paid over or delivered as follows:

                                       27

                           FIRST, to the payment of all reasonable out-of-pocket
                  costs and expenses (including without limitation reasonable
                  attorneys' fees) of the Administrative Agent in connection
                  with enforcing the rights of the Lenders under the Credit
                  Documents;

                           SECOND, to payment of any fees owed to the
                  Administrative Agent;

                           THIRD, to the payment of all reasonable out-of-pocket
                  costs and expenses (including without limitation, reasonable
                  attorneys' fees) of each of the Lenders in connection with
                  enforcing its rights under the Credit Documents or otherwise
                  with respect to the Credit Party Obligations owing to such
                  Lender;

                           FOURTH, to the payment of all of the Credit Party
                  Obligations consisting of accrued fees and interest
                  (including, without limitation, accrued fees and interest
                  arising under any Hedging Agreement between any Credit Party
                  and any Lender, or any Affiliate of a Lender);

                           FIFTH, to the payment of the outstanding principal
                  amount of the Credit Party Obligations (including, without
                  limitation, the outstanding principal amount arising under any
                  Hedging Agreement between any Credit Party and any Lender, or
                  any Affiliate of a Lender, to the extent such Hedging
                  Agreement is permitted by Section 7.1(e));

                           SIXTH, to all other Credit Party Obligations and
                  other obligations which shall have become due and payable
                  under the Credit Documents or otherwise and not repaid
                  pursuant to clauses "FIRST" through "FIFTH" above; and

                           SEVENTH, to the payment of the surplus, if any, to
                  whoever may be lawfully entitled to receive such surplus.

                  In carrying out the foregoing, (i) amounts received shall be
                  applied in the numerical order provided until exhausted prior
                  to application to the next succeeding category and (ii) each
                  of the Lenders shall receive an amount equal to its pro rata
                  share (based on the proportion that the then outstanding Loans
                  held by such Lender bears to the aggregate then outstanding
                  Loans) of amounts available to be applied pursuant to clauses
                  "THIRD", "FOURTH", "FIFTH" and "SIXTH" above.

                  3.8      Non-Receipt of Funds by the Administrative Agent.

                  (a)      Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been
         notified in writing by a Lender prior to the date a Loan is to be made
         by such Lender (which notice shall be effective upon receipt) that such
         Lender does not intend to make the proceeds of such Loan available to
         the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may assume that such
         Lender has made such proceeds available to the Administrative Agent on
         such date, and the Administrative Agent may in reliance upon such
         assumption (but shall not be

                                       28

<PAGE>

         required to) make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. If
         such corresponding amount is not in fact made available to the
         Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent shall be able to recover
         such corresponding amount from such Lender. If such Lender does not pay
         such corresponding amount forthwith upon the Administrative Agent's
         demand therefor, the Administrative Agent will promptly notify the
         Borrower, and the Borrower shall immediately pay such corresponding
         amount to the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall also
         be entitled to recover from the Lender or the Borrower, as the case may
         be, interest on such corresponding amount in respect of each day from
         the date such corresponding amount was made available by the
         Administrative Agent to the Borrower to the date such corresponding
         amount is recovered by the Administrative Agent at a per annum rate
         equal to (i) from the Borrower at the applicable rate for the
         applicable borrowing pursuant to the Notice of Borrowing and (ii) from
         a Lender at the Federal Funds Rate.

                  (b)      Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been
         notified in writing by the Borrower, prior to the date on which any
         payment is due from it hereunder (which notice shall be effective upon
         receipt) that the Borrower does not intend to make such payment, the
         Administrative Agent may assume that such Borrower has made such
         payment when due, and the Administrative Agent may in reliance upon
         such assumption (but shall not be required to) make available to each
         Lender on such payment date an amount equal to the portion of such
         assumed payment to which such Lender is entitled hereunder, and if the
         Borrower has not in fact made such payment to the Administrative Agent,
         such Lender shall, on demand, repay to the Administrative Agent the
         amount made available to such Lender. If such amount is repaid to the
         Administrative Agent on a date after the date such amount was made
         available to such Lender, such Lender shall pay to the Administrative
         Agent on demand interest on such amount in respect of each day from the
         date such amount was made available by the Administrative Agent to such
         Lender to the date such amount is recovered by the Administrative Agent
         at a per annum rate equal to the Federal Funds Rate.

                  (c)      A certificate of the Administrative Agent submitted
         to the Borrower or any Lender with respect to any amount owing under
         this Section 3.8 shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.

                  3.9      Inability to Determine Interest Rate.

         Notwithstanding any other provision of this Credit Agreement, if (i)
the Administrative Agent shall reasonably determine (which determination shall
be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that, by reason of
circumstances affecting the relevant market, reasonable and adequate means do
not exist for ascertaining LIBOR for such Interest Period, or (ii) the Required
Lenders shall reasonably determine (which determination shall be conclusive and
binding absent manifest error) that the LIBOR Rate does not adequately and
fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding LIBOR Rate Loans that the
Borrower has requested be outstanding as a LIBOR tranche during such Interest
Period, the Administrative Agent shall forthwith give telephone notice of such
determination, confirmed in writing, to the Borrower, and the Lenders at least
two Business Days prior to the first day of such Interest Period. Unless the
Borrower

                                       29

<PAGE>

shall have notified the Administrative Agent upon receipt of such telephone
notice that it wishes to rescind or modify its request regarding such LIBOR Rate
Loans, any Loans that were requested to be made as LIBOR Rate Loans shall be
made as Alternate Base Rate Loans and any Loans that were requested to be
converted into or continued as LIBOR Rate Loans shall remain as or be converted
into Alternate Base Rate Loans. Until any such notice has been withdrawn by the
Administrative Agent, no further Loans shall be made as, continued as, or
converted into, LIBOR Rate Loans for the Interest Periods so affected.

                  3.10     Illegality.

         Notwithstanding any other provision of this Credit Agreement, if the
adoption of or any change in any Requirement of Law or in the interpretation or
application thereof by the relevant Governmental Authority to any Lender shall
make it unlawful for such Lender or its LIBOR Lending Office to make or maintain
LIBOR Rate Loans as contemplated by this Credit Agreement or to obtain in the
interbank eurodollar market through its LIBOR Lending Office the funds with
which to make such Loans, (a) such Lender shall promptly notify the
Administrative Agent and the Borrower thereof, (b) the commitment of such Lender
hereunder to make LIBOR Rate Loans or continue LIBOR Rate Loans as such shall
forthwith be suspended until the Administrative Agent shall give notice that the
condition or situation which gave rise to the suspension shall no longer exist,
and (c) such Lender's Loans then outstanding as LIBOR Rate Loans, if any, shall
be converted on the last day of the Interest Period for such Loans or within
such earlier period as required by law to Alternate Base Rate Loans. The
Borrower hereby agrees promptly to pay any Lender, upon its demand, any
additional amounts necessary to compensate such Lender for actual and direct
costs (but not including anticipated profits) reasonably incurred by such Lender
including, but not limited to, any interest or fees payable by such Lender to
lenders of funds obtained by it in order to make or maintain its LIBOR Rate
Loans hereunder. A certificate as to any additional amounts payable pursuant to
this Section submitted by such Lender, through the Administrative Agent, to the
Borrower shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. Each Lender
agrees to use reasonable efforts (including reasonable efforts to change its
LIBOR Lending Office) to avoid or to minimize any amounts which may otherwise be
payable pursuant to this Section; provided, however, that such efforts shall not
cause the imposition on such Lender of any additional costs or legal or
regulatory burdens deemed by such Lender in its reasonable discretion to be
material.

                  3.11     Requirements of Law.

                  (a)      If the adoption of or any change in any Requirement
         of Law or in the interpretation or application thereof or compliance by
         any Lender with any request or directive (whether or not having the
         force of law) from any central bank or other Governmental Authority
         made subsequent to the date hereof:

                           (i)      shall subject such Lender to any tax of any
                  kind whatsoever with respect to any LIBOR Rate Loan made by
                  it, or change the basis of taxation of payments to such Lender
                  in respect thereof (except for changes in the rate of tax on
                  the overall net income of such Lender);

                                       30

<PAGE>

                           (ii)     shall impose, modify or hold applicable any
                  reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan or similar
                  requirement against assets held by, deposits or other
                  liabilities in or for the account of, advances, loans or other
                  extensions of credit by, or any other acquisition of funds by,
                  any office of such Lender which is not otherwise included in
                  the determination of the LIBOR Rate hereunder; or

                           (iii)    shall impose on such Lender any other
                  condition;

                  and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost
         to such Lender of making or maintaining LIBOR Rate Loans or to reduce
         any amount receivable hereunder or under any Note, then, in any such
         case, the Borrower shall promptly pay such Lender, upon its demand, any
         additional amounts necessary to compensate such Lender for such
         additional cost or reduced amount receivable which such Lender
         reasonably deems to be material as determined by such Lender with
         respect to its LIBOR Rate Loans. A certificate as to any additional
         amounts payable pursuant to this Section submitted by such Lender,
         through the Administrative Agent, to the Borrower shall be conclusive
         in the absence of manifest error. Each Lender agrees to use reasonable
         efforts (including reasonable efforts to change its LIBOR Lending
         Office, as the case may be) to avoid or to minimize any amounts which
         might otherwise be payable pursuant to this paragraph of this Section;
         provided, however, that such efforts shall not cause the imposition on
         such Lender of any additional costs or legal or regulatory burdens
         deemed by such Lender in its reasonable discretion to be material.

                  (b)      If (i) any Lender shall have reasonably determined
         that the adoption of or any change in any Requirement of Law regarding
         capital adequacy or in the interpretation or application thereof or
         compliance by such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender
         with any request or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or
         not having the force of law) from any central bank or Governmental
         Authority made subsequent to the date hereof does or shall have the
         effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or such
         corporation's capital as a consequence of its obligations hereunder to
         a level below that which such Lender or such corporation could have
         achieved but for such adoption, change or compliance (taking into
         consideration such Lender's or such corporation's policies with respect
         to capital adequacy) by an amount reasonably deemed by such Lender in
         its sole discretion to be material and (ii) such Lender shall provide
         the Borrower, within thirty (30) days following its determination that
         such a reduction in its rate of return has occurred, with a certificate
         demanding such additional amount (the "Shortfall Amount") as shall be
         certified by such Lender as being required to compensate it for such
         reduction, within fifteen (15) days after demand by such Lender, the
         Borrower shall pay to such Lender the Shortfall Amount. Such a
         certificate as to any additional amounts payable under this Section
         submitted by a Lender (which certificate shall include a description of
         the basis for the computation), through the Administrative Agent, to
         the Borrower shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

                  (c)      The agreements in this Section 3.11 shall survive the
         termination of this Credit Agreement and payment of the Notes and all
         other amounts payable hereunder.

                                       31

<PAGE>

                  3.12     Indemnity.

         The Borrower hereby agrees to indemnify each Lender and to hold such
Lender harmless from any funding loss or expense which such Lender may sustain
or incur as a consequence of (a) default by the Borrower in payment of the
principal amount of or interest on any Loan by such Lender in accordance with
the terms hereof, (b) default by the Borrower in accepting a borrowing after the
Borrower has given a notice in accordance with the terms hereof, (c) default by
the Borrower in making any prepayment after the Borrower has given a notice in
accordance with the terms hereof, and/or (d) the making by the Borrower of a
prepayment of a Loan, or the conversion thereof, on a day which is not the last
day of the Interest Period with respect thereto, in each case including, but not
limited to, any such loss or expense arising from interest or fees payable by
such Lender to lenders of funds obtained by it in order to maintain its Loans
hereunder. A certificate as to any additional amounts payable pursuant to this
Section submitted by any Lender, through the Administrative Agent, to the
Borrower (which certificate must be delivered to the Administrative Agent within
thirty days following such default, prepayment or conversion) shall be
conclusive in the absence of manifest error. The agreements in this Section
shall survive termination of this Credit Agreement and payment of the Notes and
all other amounts payable hereunder.

                  3.13     Taxes.

                  (a)      All payments made by the Borrower hereunder or under
         any Note will be, except as provided in Section 3.13(b), made free and
         clear of, and without deduction or withholding for, any present or
         future taxes, levies, imposts, duties, fees, assessments or other
         charges of whatever nature now or hereafter imposed by any Governmental
         Authority or by any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof
         or therein with respect to such payments (but excluding any tax imposed
         on or measured by the net income or profits of a Lender pursuant to the
         laws of the jurisdiction in which it is organized or the jurisdiction
         in which the principal office or applicable lending office of such
         Lender is located or any subdivision thereof or therein) and all
         interest, penalties or similar liabilities with respect thereto (all
         such non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts, duties, fees, assessments or
         other charges being referred to collectively as "Taxes"). If any Taxes
         are so levied or imposed, the Borrower agrees to pay the full amount of
         such Taxes, and such additional amounts as may be necessary so that
         every payment of all amounts due under this Credit Agreement or under
         any Note, after withholding or deduction for or on account of any
         Taxes, will not be less than the amount provided for herein or in such
         Note. The Borrower will furnish to the Administrative Agent as soon as
         practicable after the date the payment of any Taxes is due pursuant to
         applicable law certified copies (to the extent reasonably available and
         required by law) of tax receipts evidencing such payment by the
         Borrower. The Borrower agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each
         Lender, and reimburse such Lender upon its written request, for the
         amount of any Taxes so levied or imposed and paid by such Lender.

                  (b)      Each Lender that is not a United States person (as
         such term is defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) agrees to
         deliver to the Borrower and the

                                       32

<PAGE>

         Administrative Agent on or prior to the Closing Date, or in the case of
         a Lender that is an assignee or transferee of an interest under this
         Credit Agreement pursuant to Section 10.6 (unless the respective Lender
         was already a Lender hereunder immediately prior to such assignment or
         transfer), on the date of such assignment or transfer to such Lender,
         (i) if the Lender is a "bank" within the meaning of Section
         881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, two accurate and complete original signed
         copies of Internal Revenue Service Form 4224 or 1001 (or successor
         forms) certifying such Lender's entitlement to a complete exemption
         from United States withholding tax with respect to payments to be made
         under this Credit Agreement and under any Note, or (ii) if the Lender
         is not a "bank" within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code,
         either Internal Revenue Service Form 1001 or 4224 as set forth in
         clause (i) above, or (x) a certificate substantially in the form of
         Schedule 3.13 (any such certificate, a "3.13 Certificate") and (y) two
         accurate and complete original signed copies of Internal Revenue
         Service Form W-8 (or successor form) certifying such Lender's
         entitlement to an exemption from United States withholding tax with
         respect to payments of interest to be made under this Credit Agreement
         and under any Note. In addition, each Lender agrees that it will
         deliver upon the Borrower's request updated versions of the foregoing,
         as applicable, whenever the previous certification has become obsolete
         or inaccurate in any material respect, together with such other forms
         as may be required in order to confirm or establish the entitlement of
         such Lender to a continued exemption from or reduction in United States
         withholding tax with respect to payments under this Credit Agreement
         and any Note. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
         Section 3.13(a), but subject to the immediately succeeding sentence,
         (x) the Borrower shall be entitled, to the extent it is required to do
         so by law, to deduct or withhold Taxes imposed by the United States (or
         any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein) from
         interest, fees or other amounts payable hereunder for the account of
         any Lender which is not a United States person (as such term is defined
         in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) for U.S. Federal income tax
         purposes to the extent that such Lender has not provided to the
         Borrower U.S. Internal Revenue Service Forms that establish a complete
         exemption from such deduction or withholding and (y) the Borrower shall
         not be obligated pursuant to Section 3.13(a) hereof to gross-up
         payments to be made to a Lender in respect of Taxes imposed by the
         United States if (I) such Lender has not provided to the Borrower the
         Internal Revenue Service Forms required to be provided to the Borrower
         pursuant to this Section 3.13(b) or (II) in the case of a payment,
         other than interest, to a Lender described in clause (ii) above, to the
         extent that such Forms do not establish a complete exemption from
         withholding of such Taxes. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
         contained in the preceding sentence or elsewhere in this Section 3.13,
         the Borrower agrees to pay additional amounts and to indemnify each
         Lender in the manner set forth in Section 3.13(a) (without regard to
         the identity of the jurisdiction requiring the deduction or
         withholding) in respect of any amounts deducted or withheld by it as
         described in the immediately preceding sentence as a result of any
         changes after the Closing Date in any applicable law, treaty,
         governmental rule, regulation, guideline or order, or in the
         interpretation thereof, relating to the deducting or withholding of
         Taxes.

                  (c)      Each Lender agrees to use reasonable efforts
         (including reasonable efforts to change its LIBOR Lending Office, as
         the case may be) to avoid or to minimize any

                                       33

<PAGE>

         amounts which might otherwise be payable pursuant to this Section;
         provided, however, that such efforts shall not cause the imposition on
         such Lender of any additional costs or legal or regulatory burdens
         deemed by such Lender in its reasonable discretion to be material.

                  (d)      If the Borrower pays any additional amount pursuant
         to this Section 3.13 with respect to a Lender, such Lender shall use
         reasonable efforts to obtain a refund of tax or credit against its tax
         liabilities on account of such payment; provided that such Lender shall
         have no obligation to use such reasonable efforts if either (i) it is
         in an excess foreign tax credit position or (ii) it believes in good
         faith, in its sole discretion, that claiming a refund or credit would
         cause adverse tax consequences to it. In the event that such Lender
         receives such a refund or credit, such Lender shall pay to the Borrower
         an amount that such Lender reasonably determines is equal to the net
         tax benefit obtained by such Lender as a result of such payment by the
         Borrower. In the event that no refund or credit is obtained with
         respect to the Borrower's payments to such Lender pursuant to this
         Section 3.13, then such Lender shall upon request provide a
         certification that such Lender has not received a refund or credit for
         such payments. Nothing contained in this Section 3.13 shall require a
         Lender to disclose or detail the basis of its calculation of the amount
         of any tax benefit or any other amount or the basis of its
         determination referred to in the proviso to the first sentence of this
         Section 3.13 to the Borrower or any other party.

                  (e)      The agreements in this Section 3.13 shall survive the
         termination of this Credit Agreement and the payment of the Notes and
         all other amounts payable hereunder.

                                    SECTION 4

                                    SECTION 5
                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

         To induce the Lenders to enter into this Credit Agreement and to make
Loans herein provided for, each of the Credit Parties hereby represents and
warrants to the Administrative Agent and to each Lender that:

         5.1      Financial Condition.

         (a)      Each of the financial statements described below (copies of
which have heretofore been provided to the Administrative Agent for distribution
to the Lenders), have been prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently applied
throughout the periods covered thereby, and present fairly in all material
respects the financial condition and results from operations of the entities and
for the periods specified, subject in the case of interim company-prepared
statements to normal year-end adjustments:

                  (i)      audited consolidated balance sheet of the Borrower
         and its consolidated Subsidiaries dated as of December 31, 2000,
         together with related statements of income and cash flows certified by

         through December 31, 2001.

                                       37

<PAGE>

         5.2      No Material Adverse Change.

         Except as set forth on Schedule 4.1(j), since December 31, 2000, there
has not occurred a change in the business, assets, liabilities (financial or
otherwise) of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole which is
reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect (other than as has been
publicly disclosed from December 31, 2000 to January 24, 2002 in filings with
the Securities and Exchange Commission or in press releases made by the Borrower
in financial publications that have been widely distributed (e.g. PR Newswire or
Dow Jones Newswire) or through publication on the Borrower's website).

         5.3      Organization; Existence.

         Each Credit Party (a) is duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, (b) has the
corporate or other necessary power and authority, and the legal right to own and
operate its property, to lease the property it operates as lessee and to conduct
the business in which it is currently engaged and (c) is duly qualified as a
foreign entity and in good standing under the laws of each jurisdiction where
its ownership, lease or operation of property or the conduct of its business
requires such qualification, other than in such jurisdictions where the failure
to be so qualified and in good standing would not, in the aggregate, have a
Material Adverse Effect.

         5.4      Power; Authorization; Enforceable Obligations.

         Each Credit Party has the corporate or other necessary power and
authority, and the legal right, to make, deliver and perform the Credit
Documents to which it is a party and has taken all necessary corporate or other
action to authorize the execution, delivery and performance by it of the Credit
Documents to which it is a party. No consent or authorization of, filing with,
notice to or other act by or in respect of, any Governmental Authority or any
other Person is required in connection with acceptance of extensions of credit
by the Borrower or the making of the guaranties hereunder or with the execution,
delivery or performance of any Credit Documents by the Credit Parties (other
than those which have been obtained) or with the validity or enforceability of
any Credit Document against the Credit Parties. Each Credit Document to which it
is a party constitutes a valid and legally binding obligation of each Credit
Party enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy,
insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of
general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to general
equity principles.

         5.5      Conflict.

         The execution, delivery and performance of the Credit Documents, the
borrowings hereunder and the use of the proceeds of the Loans will not (a)
violate any Requirement of Law applicable to the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries (except those as to which waivers or consents have been obtained),
(b) conflict with, result in a breach of or constitute a default under (i) the
articles of incorporation, bylaws or other organizational documents of such
Person, (ii) any material indenture, agreement or other instrument to which such
Person is a party or by which any of its properties may be bound or (iii) any
approval of any Governmental Authority

                                       38

<PAGE>

relating to such Person, or (c) result in, or require, the creation or
imposition of any Lien on any of their respective properties or revenues
pursuant to any Requirement of Law or any Material Contract.

         5.6      No Material Litigation.

         No claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding of or before any
arbitrator or Governmental Authority is pending or, to the best knowledge of the
Credit Parties, threatened by or against any Credit Party or any of its
Subsidiaries or against any of their respective properties which (a) relates to
the Credit Documents or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby
or (b) is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect. Set forth on
Schedule 5.6 is a summary of material litigation matters pending as of the
Closing Date.

         5.7      No Default.

         No Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing.

         5.8      Taxes.

         Each of the Credit Parties and its Subsidiaries has filed, or caused to
be filed, all tax returns (federal, state, local and foreign) required to be
filed and paid (a) all amounts of taxes shown thereon to be due (including
interest and penalties) and (b) all other taxes, fees, assessments and other
governmental charges (including mortgage recording taxes, documentary stamp
taxes and intangibles taxes) owing by it, except for such taxes (i) which are
not yet delinquent or (ii) that are being contested in good faith and by proper
proceedings, and against which adequate reserves are being maintained in
accordance with GAAP. Neither any of the Credit Parties nor any of its
Subsidiaries are aware as of the Closing Date of any proposed tax assessments
against it or any of its Subsidiaries which could reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect.

         5.9      ERISA

         Neither a Reportable Event nor an "accumulated funding deficiency"
(within the meaning of Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA) has
occurred during the five-year period prior to the date on which this
representation is made or deemed made with respect to any Plan, and each Plan
has complied in all material respects with the applicable provisions of ERISA
and the Code, except to the extent that any such occurrence or failure to comply
would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. No
termination of a Single Employer Plan has occurred resulting in any liability
that has remained underfunded, and no Lien in favor of the PBGC or a Plan has
arisen, during such five-year period which could reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect. The present value of all accrued benefits under each
Single Employer Plan (based on those assumptions used to fund such Plans) did
not, as of the last annual valuation date prior to the date on which this
representation is made or deemed made, exceed the value of the assets of such
Plan allocable to such accrued benefits by an amount which, as determined in
accordance with GAAP, could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect. Neither the Borrower nor any Commonly Controlled Entity is currently

                                       39

<PAGE>

subject to any liability for a complete or partial withdrawal from a
Multiemployer Plan which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect.

         5.10     Governmental Regulations, Etc.

         (a)      No part of the proceeds of the Loans hereunder will be used,
directly or indirectly, for the purpose of purchasing or carrying any "margin
stock" within the meaning of Regulation U, or for the purpose of purchasing or
carrying or trading in any securities. If requested by any Lender or the
Administrative Agent, the Borrower will furnish to the Administrative Agent and
each Lender a statement to the foregoing effect in conformity with the
requirements of FR Form U-1 referred to in said Regulation U. No Indebtedness
being reduced or retired out of the proceeds of the Loans hereunder was or will
be incurred for the purpose of purchasing or carrying any margin stock within
the meaning of Regulation U or any "margin security" within the meaning of
Regulation T. "Margin stock" within the meaning of Regulation U does not
constitute more than 25% of the value of the consolidated assets of the Borrower
and its Subsidiaries. Neither the execution and delivery hereof by the Borrower,
nor the performance by it of any of the transactions contemplated by this Credit
Agreement (including, without limitation, the direct or indirect use of the
proceeds of the Loans) will violate or result in a violation of the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or
regulations issued pursuant thereto, or Regulation T, U or X.

         (b)      None of the Credit Parties is (i) an "investment company"
registered or required to be registered under the Investment Company Act of
1940, as amended, and is not controlled by such a company, or (ii) a "holding
company", or a "subsidiary company" of a "holding company", or an "affiliate" of
a "holding company" or of a "subsidiary" of a "holding company", within the
meaning of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended.

         5.11     Subsidiaries.

         Set forth on Schedule 5.11 is a list of all the Subsidiaries of the
Credit Parties as of the Closing Date, including a list of the Material Domestic
Subsidiaries of the Borrower, the jurisdiction of their incorporation and the
direct or indirect ownership interest of the Borrower therein.

         5.12     Use of Proceeds.

         The Loans will be used solely (a) to refinance certain existing
Indebtedness, (b) to provide general working capital and (c) for other general
corporate purposes.

         5.13     Compliance with Laws; Contractual Obligations.

         Each Credit Party and each Subsidiary is in compliance with all
Requirements of Law, except to the extent that the failure to comply therewith
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect. None of the Credit Parties is in default under or with
respect to any of its contractual obligations in any respect which could
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

                                       40

<PAGE>

         5.14     Accuracy and Completeness of Information.

         As of the Closing Date, to the best of the Borrower's knowledge, no
representation or warranty of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries contained
in this Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document or in any other document,
certificate or written statement furnished to the Lenders by or on behalf of the
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries contains any untrue statement of a material
fact or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements
contained in such agreements, documents, certificates and statements not
misleading in light of the circumstances in which the same were made.

         5.15     Environmental Matters.

         (a)      The Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries is in compliance in
all material respects with all Environmental Laws the non-compliance with which
could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         (b)      There has been no "release or threatened release of a
hazardous substance" (as defined by the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, 42 U.S.C. Section 9601 et
seq.) or any other release, emission or discharge into the environment of any
hazardous or toxic substance, pollutant or other materials from the Borrower's
or its Subsidiaries' property other than as permitted under applicable
Environmental Law and other than those which would not have a Material Adverse
Effect. Other than disposals (i) for which the Borrower has been indemnified in
full or (ii) which would not have a Material Adverse Effect, all "hazardous
waste" (as defined by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, 42 U.S.C.
Section 6901 et seq. (1976) and the regulations thereunder, 40 CFR Part 261
("RCRA")) generated at the Borrower's or any Subsidiaries' properties have in
the past been and shall continue to be disposed of at sites which maintain valid
permits under RCRA and any applicable state or local Environmental Law.

         5.16     Solvency.

         The fair saleable value of the Credit Parties' assets taken as a whole,
measured on a going concern basis, exceeds all probable liabilities, including
those to be incurred pursuant to this Credit Agreement. None of the Credit
Parties (a) has unreasonably small capital in relation to the business in which
it is or proposes to be engaged or (b) has incurred, or believes that it will
incur after giving effect to the transactions contemplated by this Credit
Agreement, debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they become due.

         5.17     No Burdensome Restrictions.

         None of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any
agreement or instrument or subject to any other obligation or any charter or
corporate restriction or any provision of any applicable law, rule or regulation
which, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

                                       41

<PAGE>

         5.18     Material Contracts.

         Schedule 5.18 sets forth a true and correct and complete list of all
Material Contracts currently in effect as of the Closing Date. All of the
Material Contracts are in full force and effect and no material defaults
currently exist thereunder.

         5.19     Insurance.

         The Borrower and its Subsidiaries maintain insurance policies for
liability, casualty and business interruption on terms and in coverage amounts
comparable to the industry standard applicable to the assets and operations of
the Borrower and its Subsidiaries.

                                    SECTION 6
                              AFFIRMATIVE COVENANTS

in full, the Credit Parties shall, and shall cause each Subsidiary to:

cash flows for the year, audited by an independent certified public accounting
firm of nationally recognized standing, setting forth in each case in
comparative form the figures for the previous year, reported without a "going
concern" or like qualification or exception, or qualification indicating that
the scope of the audit was inadequate to permit such independent certified
public accountants to certify such financial statements without such
qualification.

         (b)      Company-Prepared Financial Statements. As soon as available,

this Credit Agreement, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or
responsibilities, except those expressly set forth herein, or any fiduciary
relationship with any Lender, and no implied covenants, functions,
responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into this
Credit Agreement or otherwise exist against the Administrative Agent.

         9.2      Delegation of Duties.

         The Administrative Agent may execute any of its duties under this
Credit Agreement by or through agents or attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled
to advice of counsel concerning all matters pertaining to such duties. The
Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct
of any agents or attorneys-in-fact selected by it with reasonable care. Without
limiting the foregoing, the Administrative Agent may appoint one of its
affiliates as its agent to perform the functions of the Administrative Agent
hereunder relating to the advancing of funds to the Borrower and distribution of
funds to the Lenders and to perform such other related functions of the
Administrative Agent hereunder as are reasonably incidental to such functions.

         9.3      Exculpatory Provisions.

         Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its officers, directors,
employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or affiliates shall be (i) liable for any
action lawfully taken or omitted to be taken by it or such Person under or in
connection with this Credit Agreement (except for its or such Person's own gross
negligence or willful misconduct) or (ii) responsible in any manner to any of
the Lenders for any recitals, statements, representations or warranties made by
any Credit Party or any officer thereof contained in this Credit Agreement or in
any certificate, report, statement or other document referred to or provided for
in, or received by the Administrative Agent under or in connection with, this
Credit Agreement or for the value, validity, effectiveness, genuineness,
enforceability or sufficiency of any of the Credit Documents or for any failure
of any Credit Party to perform its obligations hereunder or thereunder. The
Administrative Agent shall not be under any obligation to any Lender to
ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or performance by any Credit Party
of any of the agreements contained in, or conditions of, this Credit Agreement,
or to inspect the properties, books or records of any Credit Party.

         9.4      Reliance by Administrative Agent.

         The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully
protected in relying, upon any Note, writing, resolution, notice, consent,
certificate, affidavit, letter, cablegram, telegram, telecopy, telex or teletype
message, statement, order or other document or conversation believed by it in
good faith to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by
the proper Person or Persons and upon advice and statements of legal counsel
(including, without limitation, counsel to the Credit Parties), independent
accountants and other experts selected by the Administrative Agent. The
Administrative Agent may deem and treat the payee of any Note as the owner
thereof for all purposes unless (a) a written notice of assignment, negotiation
or

                                       54

<PAGE>

transfer thereof shall have been filed with the Administrative Agent and (b) the
Administrative Agent shall have received the written agreement of such assignee
to be bound hereby as fully and to the same extent as if such assignee were an
original Lender party hereto, in each case in form satisfactory to the
Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall be fully justified in
failing or refusing to take any action under this Credit Agreement unless it
shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the Required Lenders as it
deems appropriate or it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the
Lenders against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by
reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. The Administrative Agent
shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting,
under any of the Credit Documents in accordance with a request of the Required
Lenders or all of the Lenders, as may be required under this Credit Agreement,
and such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall
be binding upon all the Lenders and all future holders of the Notes.

         9.5      Notice of Default.

         The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or
notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default hereunder unless the
Administrative Agent has received notice from a Lender or the Borrower referring
to this Credit Agreement, describing such Default or Event of Default and
stating that such notice is a "notice of default". In the event that the
Administrative Agent receives such a notice, the Administrative Agent shall give
prompt notice thereof to the Lenders. The Administrative Agent shall take such
action with respect to such Default or Event of Default as shall be reasonably
directed by the Required Lenders; provided, however, that unless and until the
Administrative Agent shall have received such directions, the Administrative
Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from
taking such action, with respect to such Default or Event of Default as it shall
deem advisable in the best interests of the Lenders except to the extent that
this Credit Agreement expressly requires that such action be taken, or not
taken, only with the consent or upon the authorization of the Required Lenders,
or all of the Lenders, as the case may be.

         9.6      Non-Reliance on Administrative Agent and Other Lenders.

         Each Lender expressly acknowledges that neither the Administrative
Agent nor any of its officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact
or affiliates has made any representation or warranty to it and that no act by
the Administrative Agent hereinafter taken, including any review of the affairs
of the Credit Parties, shall be deemed to constitute any representation or
warranty by the Administrative Agent to any Lender. Each Lender represents to
the Administrative Agent that it has, independently and without reliance upon
the Administrative Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and
information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of and
investigation into the business, operations, property, financial and other
condition and creditworthiness of the Credit Parties and made its own decision
to make its Loans hereunder and enter into this Credit Agreement. Each Lender
also represents that it will, independently and without reliance upon the
Administrative Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and
information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own
credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under
this Credit Agreement, and to make such investigation as it deems necessary to
inform itself as to the business, operations, property, financial and other
condition and

                                       55

<PAGE>

creditworthiness of the Credit Parties. Except for notices, reports and other
documents expressly required to be furnished to the Lenders by the
Administrative Agent hereunder, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty
or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other information
concerning the business, operations, property, condition (financial or
otherwise), prospects or creditworthiness of the Credit Parties which may come
into the possession of the Administrative Agent or any of its officers,
directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or affiliates.

         9.7      Indemnification.

         The Lenders agree to indemnify the Administrative Agent in its capacity
hereunder (to the extent not reimbursed by the Credit Parties and without
limiting the obligation of the Credit Parties to do so), ratably according to
their respective Commitment Percentages in effect on the date on which
indemnification is sought under this Section, from and against any and all
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits,
costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind whatsoever which may at any time
(including, without limitation, at any time following the payment of the Notes)
be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent in any
way relating to or arising out of any Credit Document or any documents
contemplated by or referred to herein or therein or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby or any action taken or omitted by the
Administrative Agent under or in connection with any of the foregoing; provided,
however, that no Lender shall be liable for the payment of any portion of such
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits,
costs, expenses or disbursements to the extent resulting from the Administrative
Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct, as determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction pursuant to a final non-appealable judgment. The
agreements in this Section 9.7 shall survive the termination of this Credit
Agreement and payment of the Notes and all other amounts payable hereunder.

         9.8      Administrative Agent in Its Individual Capacity.

         The Administrative Agent and its affiliates may make loans to, accept
deposits from and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower as
though the Administrative Agent were not the Administrative Agent hereunder.
With respect to its Loans made or renewed by it and any Note issued to it, the
Administrative Agent shall have the same rights and powers under this Credit
Agreement as any Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the
Administrative Agent, and the terms "Lender" and "Lenders" shall include the
Administrative Agent in its individual capacity.

         9.9      Successor Administrative Agent.

         The Administrative Agent may resign as Administrative Agent upon 30
days' prior notice to the Borrower and the Lenders. If the Administrative Agent
shall resign as Administrative Agent under this Credit Agreement and the other
Credit Documents, then the Required Lenders shall appoint from among the Lenders
a successor agent for the Lenders, which successor agent shall be approved by
the Borrower, whereupon such successor agent shall succeed to the rights, powers
and duties of the Administrative Agent, and the term "Administrative Agent"
shall mean

                                       56

<PAGE>

such successor agent effective upon such appointment and approval, and the
former Administrative Agent's rights, powers and duties as Administrative Agent
shall be terminated, without any other or further act or deed on the part of
such former Administrative Agent or any of the parties to this Credit Agreement
or any holders of the Notes. After any retiring Administrative Agent's
resignation as Administrative Agent, the provisions of this Section 9.9 shall
inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while
it was Administrative Agent under this Credit Agreement.

                                   SECTION 10
                                  MISCELLANEOUS

         10.1     Amendments, Waivers and Release of Collateral.

         Neither this Credit Agreement, nor any of the other Credit Documents,
nor any terms hereof or thereof may be amended, supplemented, waived or modified
except in accordance with the provisions of this Section. The Required Lenders
may, or, with the written consent of the Required Lenders, the Administrative
Agent may, from time to time, (a) enter into with the Borrower written
amendments, supplements or modifications hereto and to the other Credit
Documents for the purpose of adding any provisions to this Credit Agreement or
the other Credit Documents or changing in any manner the rights of the Lenders
or of the Borrower hereunder or thereunder or (b) waive, on such terms and
conditions as the Required Lenders may specify in such instrument, any of the
requirements of this Credit Agreement or the other Credit Documents or any
Default or Event of Default and its consequences; provided, however, that no
such waiver and no such amendment, waiver, supplement, modification or release
shall:

                  (i)      reduce the amount or extend the scheduled date of
         maturity of any Loan or Note or any installment thereon, or reduce the
         stated rate of any interest or fee payable hereunder (except in
         connection with a waiver of interest at the increased post-default
         rate) or extend the scheduled date of any payment thereof or increase
         the amount or extend the expiration date of any Lender's Commitment, in
         each case without the written consent of each Lender directly affected
         thereby; or

                  (ii)     amend, modify or waive any provision of this Section
         10.1 or reduce the percentage specified in the definition of Required
         Lenders, without the written consent of all the Lenders; or

                  (iii)    amend, modify or waive any provision of Section 9
         without the written consent of the then Administrative Agent; or

                  (iv)     release all or substantially all of the Guarantors
         from their obligations under the Guaranty, without the written consent
         of all of the Lenders; or

                  (v)      amend, modify or waive any provision of the Credit
         Documents requiring consent, approval or request of the Required
         Lenders or all Lenders, without the written consent of all the Lenders;

                                       57

<PAGE>

provided, further, that no amendment, waiver or consent affecting the rights or
duties of the Administrative Agent under any Credit Document shall in any event
be effective, unless in writing and signed by the Administrative Agent in
addition to the Lenders required hereinabove to take such action.

         Any such waiver, any such amendment, supplement or modification and any
such release shall apply equally to each of the Lenders and shall be binding
upon the Borrower, the other Credit Parties, the Lenders, the Administrative
Agent and all future holders of the Notes. In the case of any waiver, the
Borrower, the other Credit Parties, the Lenders and the Administrative Agent
shall be restored to their former position and rights hereunder and under the
outstanding Loans and Notes and other Credit Documents, and any Default or Event
of Default permanently waived shall be deemed to be cured and not continuing;
but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or Event of
Default, or impair any right consequent thereon.

         Notwithstanding any of the foregoing to the contrary, the consent of
the Borrower shall not be required for any amendment, modification or waiver of
the provisions of Section 9 (other than the provisions of Section 9.9);
provided, however, that the Administrative Agent will provide written notice to
the Borrower of any such amendment, modification or waiver. In addition, the
Borrower and the Lenders hereby authorize the Administrative Agent to modify
this Credit Agreement by unilaterally amending or supplementing Schedule 2.1(a)
from time to time in the manner requested by the Borrower, the Administrative
Agent or any Lender in order to reflect any assignments or transfers of the
Loans as provided for hereunder; provided further, however, that the
Administrative Agent shall promptly deliver a copy of any such modification to
the Borrower and each Lender.

         Notwithstanding the fact that the consent of all the Lenders is
required in certain circumstances as set forth above, (x) each Lender is
entitled to vote as such Lender sees fit on any bankruptcy reorganization plan
that affects the Loans, and each Lender acknowledges that the provisions of
Section 1126(c) of the Bankruptcy Code supersedes the unanimous consent
provisions set forth herein and (y) the Required Lenders may consent to allow a
Credit Party to use cash collateral in the context of a bankruptcy or insolvency
proceeding.

         10.2     Notices.

         All notices, requests and demands to or upon the respective parties
hereto to be effective shall be in writing (including by telecopy), and, unless
otherwise expressly provided herein, shall be deemed to have been duly given or

facsimile device) to the number set out herein, (c) the day following the day on
which the same has been delivered prepaid (or pursuant to an invoice

as may be hereafter notified by the respective parties hereto and any future
holders of the Notes:

         No failure to exercise and no delay in exercising, on the part of the
Administrative Agent or any Lender, any right, remedy, power or privilege
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial
exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder preclude any other
or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or
privilege. The rights, remedies, powers and privileges herein provided are
cumulative and not exclusive of any rights, remedies, powers and privileges
provided by law.

         10.4     Survival of Representations and Warranties.

         All representations and warranties made hereunder and in any document,
certificate or statement delivered pursuant hereto or in connection herewith
shall survive the execution and delivery of this Credit Agreement and the Notes
and the making of the Loans; provided that all such representations and
warranties shall terminate on the date upon which the Commitments have been
terminated and all Credit Party Obligations have been paid in full.

         10.5     Payment of Expenses and Taxes.

         The Borrower agrees (a) to pay or reimburse the Administrative Agent
and the Arranger for all their reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses
incurred in connection with the development, preparation, negotiation, printing
and execution of, and any amendment, supplement or modification to, this Credit
Agreement and the other Credit Documents and any other documents prepared in
connection herewith or therewith, and the consummation and administration of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, together with the reasonable fees
and disbursements of counsel to the Administrative Agent and the Arranger, (b)
to pay or reimburse each Lender and the Administrative Agent for all its costs
and expenses incurred in connection with the enforcement or preservation of any
rights under this Credit Agreement and the other Credit Documents, including,
without limitation, the reasonable out-of-pocket fees and disbursements of
counsel to the Administrative Agent and to the Lenders, and (c) on demand, to
pay, indemnify, and hold each Lender and the Administrative Agent harmless from,
any and all recording and filing fees and any and all liabilities with respect
to, or resulting from any delay in paying, stamp, excise and other similar
taxes, if any, which may be payable or determined to be payable in connection
with the execution and delivery of, or consummation or administration of any of
the transactions contemplated by, or any amendment, supplement or modification
of, or any waiver or consent under or in respect of, the Credit Documents and
any such other documents, and (d) to pay, indemnify, and hold each Lender and
the Administrative Agent and their Affiliates harmless from and against, any and
all other liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions,
judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature
whatsoever with respect to the execution, delivery, enforcement, performance and
administration of the Credit Documents and any such other documents and the use,
or proposed use, of proceeds of the Loans (all of the foregoing, collectively,
the "indemnified liabilities"); provided, however, that the Borrower shall not
have any obligation hereunder to the Administrative Agent or any Lender with
respect to indemnified liabilities arising from the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of the Administrative Agent or any such Lender, as determined by a
court of competent jurisdiction pursuant to a final non-appealable judgment. The
agreements in this Section 10.5 shall survive repayment of the Loans, Notes and
all other Credit Party Obligations.

         10.6     Successors and Assigns; Participations; Purchasing Lenders.

         (a)      This Credit Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the Borrower, the Lenders, the Administrative Agent, all future
holders of the Notes and their respective successors and assigns, except that
the Borrower may not assign or transfer any of its

                                       60

<PAGE>

rights or obligations under this Credit Agreement or the other Credit Documents
without the prior written consent of each Lender.

         (b)      Any Lender may, in the ordinary course of its commercial
banking business and in accordance with applicable law, at any time sell to one
or more banks or other entities ("Participants") participating interests in any
Loan owing to such Lender, any Note held by such Lender, any Commitment of such
Lender, or any other interest of such Lender hereunder. In the event of any such
sale by a Lender of participating interests to a Participant, such Lender's
obligations under this Credit Agreement to the other parties to this Credit
Agreement shall remain unchanged, such Lender shall remain solely responsible
for the performance thereof, such Lender shall remain the holder of any such
Note for all purposes under this Credit Agreement, and the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender
in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Credit
Agreement. No Lender shall transfer or grant any participation under which the
Participant shall have rights to approve any amendment to or waiver of this
Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document except to the extent such
amendment or waiver would (i) extend the scheduled maturity of any Loan or Note
or any installment thereon in which such Participant is participating, or reduce
the stated rate or extend the time of payment of interest or fees thereon
(except in connection with a waiver of interest at the increased post-default
rate) or reduce the principal amount thereof, or increase the amount of the
Participant's participation over the amount thereof then in effect (it being
understood that a waiver of any Default or Event of Default shall not constitute
a change in the terms of such participation, and that an increase in any
Commitment or Loan shall be permitted without consent of any Participant if the
Participant's participation is not increased as a result thereof), (ii) release
all or substantially all of the Guarantors from their obligations under the
Guaranty, or (iii) consent to the assignment or transfer by the Borrower of any
of its rights and obligations under this Credit Agreement. In the case of any
such participation, the Participant shall not have any rights under this Credit
Agreement or any of the other Credit Documents (the Participant's rights against
such Lender in respect of such participation to be those set forth in the
agreement executed by such Lender in favor of the Participant relating thereto)
and all amounts payable by the Borrower hereunder shall be determined as if such
Lender had not sold such participation; provided that each Participant shall be
entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.10, 3.11, 3.12 and 10.5 with respect to
its participation in the Commitments and the Loans outstanding from time to
time; provided further, that no Participant shall be entitled to receive any
greater amount pursuant to such Sections than the transferor Lender would have
been entitled to receive in respect of the amount of the participation
transferred by such transferor Lender to such Participant had no such transfer
occurred.

         (c)      Any Lender may, in the ordinary course of its commercial
banking business and in accordance with applicable law, at any time, sell or
assign to any Lender or any Affiliate or Related Fund thereof and, with the
consent of the Administrative Agent and, so long as no Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing, the Borrower (in each case, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld), to one or more additional banks or financial
institutions or entities ("Purchasing Lenders"), all or any part of its rights
and obligations under this Credit Agreement and the Notes in minimum amounts of
$5,000,000 with respect to its Commitment and Loans (or, if less, the entire
amount of such Lender's obligations), pursuant to a Commitment Transfer

                                       61

<PAGE>

Supplement, executed by such Purchasing Lender and such transferor Lender (and,
to the extent required above, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower), and
delivered to the Administrative Agent for its acceptance and recording in the
Register; provided, however, that any sale or assignment to an existing Lender
shall not require the consent of the Administrative Agent or the Borrower nor
shall any such sale or assignment be subject to the minimum assignment amounts
specified herein. Upon such execution, delivery, acceptance and recording, from
and after the Transfer Effective Date specified in such Commitment Transfer
Supplement, (x) the Purchasing Lender thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to
the extent provided in such Commitment Transfer Supplement, have the rights and
obligations of a Lender hereunder with a Commitment as set forth therein, and
(y) the transferor Lender thereunder shall, to the extent provided in such
Commitment Transfer Supplement, be released from its obligations under this
Credit Agreement (and, in the case of a Commitment Transfer Supplement covering
all or the remaining portion of a transferor Lender's rights and obligations
under this Credit Agreement, such transferor Lender shall cease to be a party
hereto; provided, however, that such Lender shall still be entitled to any
indemnification rights hereunder). Such Commitment Transfer Supplement shall be
deemed to amend this Credit Agreement to the extent, and only to the extent,
necessary to reflect the addition of such Purchasing Lender and the resulting
adjustment of Commitment Percentages arising from the purchase by such
Purchasing Lender of all or a portion of the rights and obligations of such
transferor Lender under this Credit Agreement and the Notes. On or prior to the
Transfer Effective Date specified in such Commitment Transfer Supplement, the
Borrower shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent in exchange for
the Notes delivered to the Administrative Agent pursuant to such Commitment
Transfer Supplement new Notes to the order of such Purchasing Lender in an
amount equal to the Commitment assumed by it pursuant to such Commitment
Transfer Supplement and, unless the transferor Lender has not retained a
Commitment hereunder, new Notes to the order of the transferor Lender in an
amount equal to the Commitment retained by it hereunder. Such new Notes shall be
dated the Closing Date and shall otherwise be in the form of the Notes replaced
thereby. The Notes surrendered by the transferor Lender shall be returned by the
Administrative Agent to the Borrower marked "canceled".

         (d)      The Administrative Agent shall maintain at its address
referred to in Section 10.2 a copy of each Commitment Transfer Supplement
delivered to it and a register (the "Register") for the recordation of the names
and addresses of the Lenders and the Commitment of, and principal amount of the
Loans owing to, each Lender from time to time. The entries in the Register shall
be conclusive, in the absence of manifest error, and the Borrower, the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is
recorded in the Register as the owner of the Loan recorded therein for all
purposes of this Credit Agreement. The Register shall be available for
inspection by the Borrower or any Lender at any reasonable time and from time to
time upon reasonable prior notice.

         (e)      Upon its receipt of a duly executed Commitment Transfer
Supplement, together with payment to the Administrative Agent by the transferor
Lender or the Purchasing Lender, as agreed between them, of a registration and
processing fee of $3,500.00 for each Purchasing Lender listed in such Commitment
Transfer Supplement and the Notes subject to such Commitment Transfer
Supplement, the Administrative Agent shall (i) accept such Commitment

                                       62

<PAGE>

Transfer Supplement, (ii) record the information contained therein in the
Register and (iii) give prompt notice of such acceptance and recordation to the
Lenders and the Borrower.

         (f)      The Borrower authorizes each Lender to disclose to any
Participant or Purchasing Lender (each, a "Transferee") and any prospective
Transferee any and all financial information in such Lender's possession
concerning the Borrower and its Affiliates which has been delivered to such
Lender by or on behalf of the Borrower pursuant to this Credit Agreement or
which has been delivered to such Lender by or on behalf of the Borrower in
connection with such Lender's credit evaluation of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries prior to becoming a party to this Credit Agreement, in each case
subject to Section 10.16.

         (g)      At the time of each assignment pursuant to this Section 10.6
to a Person which is not already a Lender hereunder and which is not a United
States person (as such term is defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) for
Federal income tax purposes, the respective assignee Lender shall provide to the
Borrower and the Administrative Agent the appropriate Internal Revenue Service
Forms (and, if applicable, a 3.13 Certificate) described in Section 3.13.

         (h)      Nothing herein shall prohibit any Lender from pledging or
assigning any of its rights under this Credit Agreement (including, without
limitation, any right to payment of principal and interest under any Note) to
any Federal Reserve Bank in accordance with applicable laws.

         10.7     Adjustments; Set-off.

         (a)      Each Lender agrees that if any Lender (a "benefited Lender")
shall at any time receive any payment of all or part of its Loans, or interest
thereon, or receive any collateral in respect thereof (whether voluntarily or
involuntarily, by set-off, pursuant to events or proceedings of the nature
referred to in Section 8.1(e), or otherwise) in a greater proportion than any
such payment to or collateral received by any other Lender, if any, in respect
of such other Lender's Loans, or interest thereon, such benefited Lender shall
purchase for cash from the other Lenders a participating interest in such
portion of each such other Lender's Loan, or shall provide such other Lenders
with the benefits of any such collateral, or the proceeds thereof, as shall be
necessary to cause such benefited Lender to share the excess payment or benefits
of such collateral or proceeds ratably with each of the Lenders; provided,
however, that if all or any portion of such excess payment or benefits is
thereafter recovered from such benefited Lender, such purchase shall be
rescinded, and the purchase price and benefits returned, to the extent of such
recovery, but without interest. The Borrower agrees that each Lender so
purchasing a portion of another Lender's Loans may exercise all rights of
payment (including, without limitation, rights of set-off) with respect to such
portion as fully as if such Lender were the direct holder of such portion.

         (b)      In addition to any rights and remedies of the Lenders provided
by law (including, without limitation, other rights of set-off), each Lender
shall have the right, without prior notice to any Credit Party, any such notice
being expressly waived by the Credit Parties to the extent permitted by
applicable law, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default, to setoff and
appropriate and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand,
provisional or

                                       63

final), in any currency, and any other credits, indebtedness or claims, in any
currency, in each case whether direct or indirect, absolute or contingent,
matured or unmatured, at any time held or owing by such Lender or any branch or
agency thereof to or for the credit or the account of any Credit Party, or any
part thereof in such amounts as such Lender may elect, against and on account of
the obligations and liabilities of the Borrower and the other Credit Parties to
such Lender hereunder and claims of every nature and description of such Lender
against the Borrower and the other Credit Parties, in any currency, whether
arising hereunder, under the Notes or under any documents contemplated by or
referred to herein or therein, as such Lender may elect, whether or not such
Lender has made any demand for payment and although such obligations,
liabilities and claims may be contingent or unmatured. The aforesaid right of
set-off may be exercised by such Lender against any Credit Party or against any
trustee in bankruptcy, debtor in possession, assignee for the benefit of
creditors, receiver or execution, judgment or attachment creditor of any such
Credit Party, or against anyone else claiming through or against any such Credit
Party or any such trustee in bankruptcy, debtor in possession, assignee for the
benefit of creditors, receiver, or execution, judgment or attachment creditor,
notwithstanding the fact that such right of set-off shall not have been
exercised by such Lender prior to the occurrence of any Event of Default. Each
Lender agrees promptly to notify the applicable Credit Party and the
Administrative Agent after any such set-off and application made by such Lender;
provided, however, that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the
validity of such set-off and application.

         10.8     Table of Contents and Section Headings.

         The table of contents and the Section and subsection headings herein

such office that the same has been signed and mailed to it.

         10.11    Severability.

unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective
to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the

         10.15    Arbitration.

         (a)      Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 10.14 to the
contrary, upon demand of any party hereto, whether made before or within three
(3) months after institution of any judicial proceeding, any dispute, claim or
controversy arising out of, connected with or relating to this Credit Agreement
and other Credit Documents ("Disputes") between or among parties to this

                                       65

<PAGE>

Credit Agreement shall be resolved by binding arbitration as provided herein.
Institution of a judicial proceeding by a party does not waive the right of that
party to demand arbitration hereunder. Disputes may include, without limitation,
tort claims, counterclaims, disputes as to whether a matter is subject to
arbitration, claims brought as class actions, claims arising from Credit
Documents executed in the future, or claims arising out of or connected with the
transaction reflected by this Credit Agreement.

         Arbitration shall be conducted under and governed by the Commercial
Arbitration Rules (the "Arbitration Rules") of the American Arbitration
Association (the "AAA") and Title 9 of the U.S. Code. All arbitration hearings
shall be conducted in New York, New York. A hearing shall begin within 90 days
of demand for arbitration and all hearings shall be concluded within 120 days of
demand for arbitration. These time limitations may not be extended unless a
party shows cause for extension and then no more than a total extension of 60
days. The expedited procedures set forth in Rule 51 et seq. of the Arbitration
Rules shall be applicable to claims of less than $1,000,000. All applicable
statutes of limitation shall apply to any Dispute. A judgment upon the award may
be entered in any court having jurisdiction. Arbitrators shall be licensed
attorneys selected from the Commercial Financial Dispute Arbitration Panel of

law except as provided herein.

         (b)      Notwithstanding the preceding binding arbitration provisions,
the Administrative Agent, the Lenders, the Borrower and the other Credit Parties
agree to preserve, without diminution, certain remedies that the Administrative
Agent on behalf of the Lenders may employ or exercise freely, independently or
in connection with an arbitration proceeding or after an arbitration action is
brought. The Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lenders shall have the right
to proceed in any court of proper jurisdiction or by self-help to exercise or
prosecute the following remedies, as applicable (i) obtaining provisional or
ancillary remedies including injunctive relief, sequestration, garnishment,
attachment, appointment of receiver and filing an involuntary bankruptcy
proceeding; and (ii) when applicable, a judgment by confession of judgment.
Preservation of these remedies does not limit the power of an arbitrator to
grant similar remedies that may be requested by a party in a Dispute.

         (c)      The parties hereto agree that they shall not have a remedy of
punitive or exemplary damages against the other in any Dispute and hereby waive
any right or claim to punitive or exemplary damages they have now or which may
arise in the future in connection with any Dispute whether the Dispute is
resolved by arbitration or judicially.

         (d)      By execution and delivery of this Credit Agreement, each of
the parties hereto accepts, for itself and in connection with its properties,
generally and unconditionally, the non-exclusive jurisdiction relating to any
arbitration proceedings conducted under the Arbitration Rules in New York, New
York and irrevocably agrees to be bound by any final judgment rendered thereby
in connection with this Credit Agreement from which no appeal has been taken or
is available.

                                   SECTION 11
                                    GUARANTY

         11.1     The Guaranty.

         In order to induce the Lenders to enter into this Credit Agreement and
to extend credit hereunder and in recognition of the direct benefits to be
received by the Guarantors from the Extensions of Credit hereunder, each of the
Guarantors hereby agrees with the Administrative Agent and the Lenders as
follows: the Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably jointly and
severally guarantees as primary obligor and not merely as surety the full and
prompt payment when due, whether upon maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of
any and all Credit Party Obligations. If any or all of the Credit Party
Obligations becomes due and payable hereunder, each Guarantor unconditionally
promises to pay such Credit Party Obligations to the Administrative Agent and
the Lenders, or order, or demand, together with any and all reasonable expenses
which may be incurred by the Administrative Agent or the Lenders in collecting
any of the Credit Party Obligations.

         Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained herein or in
any other of the Credit Documents, to the extent the obligations of a Guarantor
shall be adjudicated to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason (including,
without limitation, because of any applicable state or federal law relating to
fraudulent conveyances or transfers) then the obligations of each such Guarantor
hereunder shall be limited to the maximum amount that is permissible under
applicable law (whether federal or state and including, without limitation, the
Bankruptcy Code).

         11.2     Bankruptcy.

         Additionally, each of the Guarantors unconditionally and irrevocably
guarantees jointly and severally the payment of any and all Credit Party
Obligations of the Borrower to the Lenders whether or not due or payable by the
Borrower upon the occurrence of any of the events specified in Section 8.1(e),
and unconditionally promises to pay such Credit Party Obligations to the
Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders, or order, on demand, in
lawful money of the United States. Each of the Guarantors further agrees that to
the extent that the Borrower or a Guarantor shall make a payment or a transfer
of an interest in any property to the Administrative Agent or any Lender, which
payment or transfer or any part thereof is subsequently invalidated, declared to
be fraudulent or preferential, or otherwise is avoided, and/or required to be
repaid to the Borrower or a Guarantor, the estate of the Borrower or a
Guarantor, a trustee, receiver or any other party under any bankruptcy law,
state or federal law, common law or equitable cause, then to the extent of such
avoidance or repayment, the obligation or part thereof intended to be satisfied
shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as if said payment had
not been made.

         11.3     Nature of Liability.

         The liability of each Guarantor hereunder is exclusive and independent
of any security for or other guaranty of the Credit Party Obligations of the
Borrower whether executed by any such Guarantor, any other guarantor or by any
other party, and no Guarantor's liability hereunder shall be affected or
impaired by (a) any direction as to application of payment by the Borrower or by
any other party, or (b) any other continuing or other guaranty, undertaking or
maximum liability of a guarantor or of any other party as to the Credit Party
Obligations of the Borrower, or (c) any payment on or in reduction of any such
other guaranty or undertaking, or (d) any dissolution, termination or increase,
decrease or change in personnel by the Borrower, or (e) any payment made to the
Administrative Agent or the Lenders on the Credit Party Obligations which the
Administrative Agent or such Lenders repay the Borrower pursuant to court order
in any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, moratorium or other debtor
relief proceeding, and each of the Guarantors waives any right to the deferral
or modification of its obligations hereunder by reason of any such proceeding.

         11.4     Independent Obligation.

         The obligations of each Guarantor hereunder are independent of the
obligations of any other guarantor or the Borrower, and a separate action or
actions may be brought and prosecuted against each Guarantor whether or not
action is brought against any other guarantor or the Borrower and whether or not
any other Guarantor or the Borrower is joined in any such action or actions.

         11.5     Authorization.

         Each of the Guarantors authorizes the Administrative Agent and each
Lender without notice or demand (except as shall be required by applicable
statute and cannot be waived), and without affecting or impairing its liability
hereunder, from time to time to (a) renew, compromise, extend, increase,
accelerate or otherwise change the time for payment of, or otherwise change the
terms of the Credit Party Obligations or any part thereof in accordance with
this Credit Agreement, including any increase or decrease of the rate of
interest thereon, (b) take and hold security from any guarantor or any other
party for the payment of this Guaranty or the Credit Party Obligations and
exchange, enforce waive and release any such security, (c) apply such security
and direct the order or manner of sale thereof as the Administrative Agent and
the Lenders in their discretion may determine and (d) release or substitute any
one or more endorsers, guarantors, the Borrower or other obligors.

         11.6     Reliance.

         It is not necessary for the Administrative Agent or the Lenders to
inquire into the capacity or powers of the Borrower or the officers, directors,
members, partners or agents acting or purporting to act on its behalf, and any
indebtedness made or created in reliance upon the professed exercise of such
powers shall be guaranteed hereunder.

                                       69

<PAGE>

         11.7     Waiver.

         (a)      Each of the Guarantors waives any right (except as shall be
required by applicable statute and cannot be waived) to require the
Administrative Agent or any Lender to (i) proceed against the Borrower, any
other guarantor or any other party, (ii) proceed against or exhaust any security
held from the Borrower, any other guarantor or any other party, or (iii) pursue
any other remedy in the Administrative Agent's or any Lender's power whatsoever.
Each of the Guarantors waives any defense based on or arising out of any defense
of the Borrower, any other guarantor or any other party other than payment in
full of the Credit Party Obligations, including without limitation any defense
based on or arising out of the disability of the Borrower, any other guarantor
or any other party, or the unenforceability of the Credit Party Obligations or
any part thereof from any cause, or the cessation from any cause of the
liability of the Borrower other than payment in full of the Credit Party
Obligations. The Administrative Agent or any of the Lenders may, at their
election, foreclose on any security held by the Administrative Agent or a Lender
by one or more judicial or nonjudicial sales, whether or not every aspect of any
such sale is commercially reasonable (to the extent such sale is permitted by
applicable law), or exercise any other right or remedy the Administrative Agent
and any Lender may have against the Borrower or any other party, or any
security, without affecting or impairing in any way the liability of any
Guarantor hereunder except to the extent the Credit Party Obligations have been
paid in full. Each of the Guarantors waives any defense arising out of any such
election by the Administrative Agent and each of the Lenders, even though such
election operates to impair or extinguish any right of reimbursement or
subrogation or other right or remedy of the Guarantors against the Borrower or
any other party or any security.

         (b)      Each of the Guarantors waives all presentments, demands for
performance, protests and notices, including without limitation notices of
nonperformance, notice of protest, notices of dishonor, notices of acceptance of
this Guaranty, and notices of the existence, creation or incurring of new or
additional Credit Party Obligations. Each Guarantor assumes all responsibility
for being and keeping itself informed of the Borrower's financial condition and
assets, and of all other circumstances bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of
the Credit Party Obligations and the nature, scope and extent of the risks which
such Guarantor assumes and incurs hereunder, and agrees that neither the
Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall have any duty to advise such Guarantor
of information known to it regarding such circumstances or risks.

         (c)      Each of the Guarantors hereby agrees it will not exercise any
rights of subrogation which it may at any time otherwise have as a result of
this Guaranty (whether contractual, under Section 509 of the U.S. Bankruptcy
Code, or otherwise) to the claims of the Lenders against the Borrower or any
other guarantor of the Credit Party Obligations of the Borrower owing to the
Lenders (collectively, the "Other Parties") and all contractual, statutory or
common law rights of reimbursement, contribution or indemnity from any Other
Party which it may at any time otherwise have as a result of this Guaranty until
such time as the Credit Party Obligations shall have been paid in full and the
Commitments have been terminated. Each of the Guarantors hereby further agrees
not to exercise any right to enforce any other remedy which the Administrative
Agent and the Lenders now have or may hereafter have against any Other Party,
any endorser or any other guarantor of all or any part of the Credit Party
Obligations of the Borrower and any benefit of, and any right to participate in,
any security or collateral given to or

                                       70

<PAGE>

for the benefit of the Lenders to secure payment of the Credit Party Obligations
of the Borrower until such time as the Credit Party Obligations shall have been
paid in full and the Commitments have been terminated.

         11.8     Limitation on Enforcement.

         The Lenders agree that this Guaranty may be enforced only by the action
of the Administrative Agent acting upon the instructions of the Required Lenders
and that no Lender shall have any right individually to seek to enforce or to
enforce this Guaranty, it being understood and agreed that such rights and
remedies may be exercised by the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the
Lenders under the terms of this Credit Agreement. The Lenders further agree that
this Guaranty may not be enforced against any director, officer, employee or
stockholder of the Guarantors.

         11.9     Confirmation of Payment.

         The Administrative Agent and the Lenders will, upon request after
payment of the Credit Party Obligations which are the subject of this Guaranty
and termination of the Commitments relating thereto, confirm to the Borrower,
the Guarantors or any other Person that the Credit Party Obligations have been
paid in full and the Commitments relating thereto terminated, subject to the
provisions of Section 11.2.

provided therein. In the event this Note is not paid when due at any stated or
accelerated maturity, the Borrower agrees to pay, in addition to principal and
interest, all costs of collection, including reasonable attorneys' fees.

                             MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT

ARGENTINA IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IN FIRST QUARTER OF 2002

In 2002, Borrower adopted FASB Statement No. 142 "Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets" ("FAS No. 142") which establishes a new method of testing goodwill and
other intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment. Pursuant to FAS
No. 142, Borrower will record a $43.3 million after-tax impairment charge for
Argentina in the first quarter of 2002. This charge was publicly announced on
March 19, 2002.

                                  Schedule 5.6

                               MATERIAL LITIGATION

         EEOC v. Dial (U.S. District Court, Northern District of Illinois). The
         EEOC alleges that Dial engaged in a pattern and practice of
         discrimination against a class of female employees by subjecting them
         to sexual or sex-based harassment and failing to take prompt remedial
         action after these employees complained about the alleged harassment.
         The EEOC is seeking to enjoin Dial from this alleged harassment, to
         require Dial to train its managerial employees regarding the
         requirements of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and to
         recover unspecified compensatory and punitive damages. Dial has denied
         the EEOC's allegations. After discovery was completed, Dial filed a
         dispositive motion, which was granted in part and denied in part by the
         Court in an opinion issued in the third quarter of 2001. The Court
         granted Dial's motion to dismiss the claims of thirteen individuals and
         denied its motion with respect to the remaining individuals. Dial
         petitioned the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals to review the U.S.
         District Court's ruling on Dial's summary judgment motion but the
         Seventh Circuit denied Dial's petition for an interlocutory appeal. A
         trial date has not been set.

         SEC Informal Inquiry. In September 2000, the SEC sent a letter to Dial
         stating that it had initiated an informal inquiry regarding the
         disclosure of Dial's sales practices and, in particular, "trade
         loading" and requesting that Dial produce related documents and
         information. Dial produced the requested documents and information to
         the SEC in November 2000 and did not hear back from the SEC until
         January 2002. In January 2002, the SEC requested that Dial's former
         Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer provide testimony
         on these issues. It is anticipated that their testimony will be taken
         in April of 2002. In February 2002, the SEC requested that Dial's
         current Chief Executive Officer provide testimony and he is scheduled
         to give such testimony on April 2, 2002. We are not able to predict
         what, if any, action that the SEC will take with respect to this
         matter.

                                JOINDER AGREEMENT

         THIS JOINDER AGREEMENT (the "Agreement"), dated as of _____________,

         1.       The Subsidiary Guarantor hereby acknowledges, agrees and
confirms that, by its execution of this Agreement, the Subsidiary Guarantor will
be deemed to be a party to the Credit Agreement and a "Guarantor" for all
purposes of the Credit Agreement and the other Credit Documents, and shall have
all of the obligations of a Guarantor thereunder as if it had executed the
Credit Agreement and the other Credit Documents. The Subsidiary Guarantor hereby
ratifies, as of the date hereof, and agrees to be bound by, all of the terms,
provisions and conditions contained in the Credit Documents, including without
limitation (a) all of the representations and warranties of the Credit Parties
set forth in Section 5 of the Credit Agreement and (b) all of the affirmative
and negative covenants set forth in Sections 6 and 7 of the Credit Agreement.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing terms of this paragraph 1, the
Subsidiary Guarantor hereby jointly and severally together with the other
Guarantors, guarantees to each Lender and the Administrative Agent as provided
in the Credit Agreement the prompt payment and performance of the Credit Party
Obligations in full when due (whether at stated maturity, as a mandatory
prepayment, by acceleration, as a mandatory cash collateralization or otherwise)
strictly in accordance with the terms thereof and agrees that if any of such
Credit Party Obligations are not paid or performed in full when due (whether at
stated maturity, as a mandatory prepayment, by acceleration, as a mandatory cash
collateralization or otherwise), the Subsidiary Guarantor will, jointly and
severally together with the other Guarantors, promptly pay and perform the same,
without any demand or notice whatsoever, and that in the case of any extension
of time of payment or renewal of any of the Credit Party Obligations, the same
will be promptly paid in full when due (whether at extended maturity, as a
mandatory prepayment, by acceleration, as a mandatory cash collateralization or
otherwise) in accordance with the terms of such extension or renewal.

         2.       The Subsidiary Guarantor acknowledges and confirms that it has
received a copy of the Credit Agreement and the schedules and exhibits thereto.
The information on the schedules to the Credit Agreement are hereby amended to
provide the information shown on the attached Schedule A.

<PAGE>

         3.       The Borrower and the Guarantors confirm that all of their
obligations under the Credit Agreement are, and upon the Subsidiary Guarantor
becoming a Guarantor, shall continue to be, in full force and effect. The
parties hereto confirm and agree that immediately upon the Subsidiary Guarantor
becoming a Guarantor, the term "Credit Party Obligations," as used in the Credit
Agreement, shall include all obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor under the
Credit Agreement and under each other Credit Document.

         4.       The Subsidiary Guarantor hereby agrees that upon becoming a
Guarantor it will assume all Credit Party Obligations of a Guarantor as set
forth in the Credit Agreement.

         5.       Each of the Borrower and the Subsidiary Guarantor agrees that
at any time and from time to time, upon the written request of the
Administrative Agent, it will execute and deliver such further documents and do
such further acts and things as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request
in order to effect the purposes of this Agreement.

         6.       This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts,
each of which shall constitute an original but all of which when taken together
shall constitute one contract.

         7.       This Agreement  shall be governed by and construed and
interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of North Carolina.

                                       2

                                    [FORM OF]
                         COMMITMENT TRANSFER SUPPLEMENT

         Reference is made to the 364-Day Credit Agreement, dated as of March
27, 2002 (as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the
"Credit Agreement"), among THE DIAL CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation (the
"Borrower"), the Domestic Subsidiaries of the Borrower identified therein (the
"Guarantors"), the banks and financial institutions from time to time parties
thereto (the "Lenders") and First Union National Bank, as administrative agent
for the Lenders (in such capacity, the "Administrative Agent"). Unless otherwise
defined herein, terms defined in the Credit Agreement and used herein shall have
the meanings provided in the Credit Agreement.

         ___________________________ (the  "Transferor  Lender") and
_________________________  (the  "Purchasing  Lender")  agree as follows:

         1.       The Transferor Lender hereby irrevocably sells and assigns to
the Purchasing Lender without recourse to the Transferor Lender, and the
Purchasing Lender hereby irrevocably purchases and assumes from the Transferor
Lender without recourse to the Transferor Lender, as of the Transfer Effective
Date (as defined below), in and to the Transferor Lender's rights and
obligations under the Credit Agreement with respect to those credit facilities
contained in the Credit Agreement as are set forth on Schedule 1 attached hereto
(individually, an "Assigned Facility"; collectively, the "Assigned Facilities"),
in a principal amount for each Assigned Facility as set forth on such Schedule 1
(collectively, the "Assigned Interest"), together with the Commitment Percentage
corresponding to each such principal amount.

         2.       The Transferor Lender (a) makes no representation or warranty
and assumes no responsibility with respect to any statements, warranties or
representations made in or in connection with the Credit Agreement or with
respect to the execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness,
sufficiency or value of the Credit Agreement, any other Credit Document or any
other instrument or document furnished pursuant thereto, other than that the
Transferor Lender has not created any adverse claim upon the interest being
assigned by it hereunder and that such interest is free and clear of any such
adverse claim; (b) makes no representation or warranty and assumes no
responsibility with respect to the financial condition of any Credit Party or
any other obligor or the performance or observance by any Credit Party or any
other obligor of any of their respective obligations under the Credit Agreement
or any other Credit Document or any other instrument or document furnished
pursuant hereto or thereto; and (c) attaches any Note(s) held by it evidencing
the Assigned Facilities and (i) requests that the Administrative Agent exchange
the attached Note(s) for a new Note(s) payable to the Purchasing Lender and (ii)
if the Transferor Lender has retained any interest in the Assigned Facility,
requests that the Administrative Agent exchange the attached Note(s) for a new
Note(s) payable to the Transferor Lender, in each case in amounts which reflect
the assignment being made hereby (and after giving effect to any other
assignments which have become effective on the Transfer Effective Date).

         3.       The Purchasing Lender (a) represents and warrants that it is
legally authorized to enter into this Commitment Transfer Supplement; (b)
confirms that it has received a copy of the Credit Agreement, together with
copies of the financial statements referred to in Section 5.1 thereof, the
financial statements delivered pursuant to Section 6.1 thereof, if any, and such
other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate to make its own
credit analysis and decision to enter into this Commitment Transfer Supplement;
(c) agrees that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Transferor
Lender, the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents
and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its
own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under the Credit Agreement,
the other Credit Documents or any other instrument or document furnished
pursuant hereto or thereto; (d) appoints and authorizes the Administrative Agent
to take such action as agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers and
discretion under the Credit Agreement, the other loan documents

                                       2

<PAGE>

or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto or thereto as are
delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms thereof, together with such
powers as are incidental thereto; and (e) agrees that it will be bound by the
provisions of the Credit Agreement and will perform in accordance with its terms
all the obligations which by the terms of the Credit Agreement are required to
be performed by it as a Lender including, if it is organized under the laws of a
jurisdiction outside the United States, its obligations pursuant to Section 3.13
of the Credit Agreement.

         4.       The effective date of this Commitment Transfer Supplement
shall be ________ ___, 20__ (the "Transfer Effective Date"). Following the
execution of this Commitment Transfer Supplement, it will be delivered to the
Administrative Agent for acceptance by it and recording by the Administrative
Agent pursuant to the Credit Agreement, effective as of the Transfer Effective
Date, along with any registration and processing fee due and payable to the
Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 10.6 of the Credit Agreement.

         5.       Upon such acceptance and recording, from and after the
Transfer Effective Date, the Administrative Agent shall make all payments in
respect of the Assigned Interest (including payments of principal, interest,
fees and other amounts) to the Purchasing Lender whether such amounts have
accrued prior to the Transfer Effective Date or accrue subsequent to the
Transfer Effective Date. The Transferor Lender and the Purchasing Lender shall
make all appropriate adjustments in payments by the Administrative Agent for
periods prior to the Transfer Effective Date or, with respect to the making of
this assignment, directly between themselves.

         6.       From and after the Transfer Effective Date, (a) the Purchasing
Lender shall be a party to the Credit Agreement and, to the extent provided in
this Commitment Transfer Supplement, have the rights and obligations of a Lender

                           THREE YEAR CREDIT AGREEMENT

         THIS THREE YEAR CREDIT AGREEMENT dated as of March 27, 2002 (the
"Credit Agreement"), is by and among THE DIAL CORPORATION, a Delaware
corporation (the "Borrower"), certain Domestic Subsidiaries of the Borrower
listed on the signature pages hereto and as may from time to time become a party
hereto (collectively the "Guarantors" and individually, a "Guarantor"), the
lenders named herein and such other lenders as may become a party hereto (the
"Lenders" and individually, a "Lender"), FIRST UNION NATIONAL BANK, as
Administrative Agent for the Lenders (in such capacity, the "Administrative
Agent"), BANK OF AMERICA, N.A., as Syndication Agent for the Lenders, and BANK
ONE, NA and CREDIT LYONNAIS LOS ANGELES BRANCH, as Co-Documentation Agents for
the Lenders.

                                   WITNESSETH

         WHEREAS, the Borrower has requested that the Lenders provide a $75
million credit facility for the purposes hereinafter set forth; and

         WHEREAS, the Lenders have agreed to make the requested credit facility
available to the Borrower on the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth.

         NOW, THEREFORE, IN CONSIDERATION of the premises and other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

                                    SECTION 1
                                   DEFINITIONS

         1.1      Definitions.

         As used in this Credit Agreement, the following terms shall have the
meanings specified below unless the context otherwise requires:

         "Account Designation Letter" means the Notice of Account Designation
Letter dated the Closing Date from the Borrower to the Administrative Agent in
substantially the form attached hereto as Schedule 1.1-1.

         "Additional Commitment" means, with respect to any Lender which
executes a New Commitment Agreement in accordance with Section 3.4(c), the
commitment of such Lender in an aggregate principal amount up to the amount
specified in such New Commitment Agreement to make Revolving Loans in accordance
with the provisions of Section 2.1.

         "Administrative Agent" shall have the meaning assigned to such term in
the first paragraph hereof, together with any successors or assigns.

                                       1

<PAGE>

         "Administrative Agent's Fees" shall have the meaning assigned to such
term in Section 3.5(c).

         "Affiliate" means as to any Person, any other Person which, directly or
indirectly, is in control of, is controlled by, or is under common control with,
such Person. For purposes of this definition, a Person shall be deemed to be
"controlled by" a Person if such Person possesses, directly or indirectly, power
either (a) to vote 20% or more of the securities having ordinary voting power
for the election of directors of such Person or (b) to direct or cause the
direction of the management and policies of such Person whether by contract or
otherwise.

         "Aggregate Commitment" means, for any Utilization Period, the sum of
the Aggregate Revolving Committed Amount under this Credit Agreement and the
commitments under the 364-Day Facility Credit Agreement.

         "Aggregate Revolving Committed Amount" means the aggregate amount of
Commitments in effect from time to time, being initially SEVENTY FIVE MILLION
DOLLARS ($75,000,000), and as such aggregate amount may be increased or reduced
from time to time as provided in Section 3.4.

         "Alternate Base Rate" means, for any day, the rate per annum (rounded
upwards, if necessary, to the nearest whole multiple of 1/100 of 1%) equal to
the greater of (a) the Federal Funds Rate in effect on such day plus 1/2 of 1%
or (b) the Prime Rate in effect on such day. If for any reason the
Administrative Agent shall have reasonably determined (which determination shall
be conclusive absent manifest error) that it is unable after due inquiry to
ascertain the Federal Funds Rate for any reason, including the inability or
failure of the Administrative Agent to obtain sufficient quotations in
accordance with the terms hereof, the Alternate Base Rate shall be determined
without regard to clause (a) of the first sentence of this definition until the
circumstances giving rise to such inability no longer exist. Any change in the
Alternate Base Rate due to a change in the Prime Rate or the Federal Funds Rate
shall be effective on the effective date of such change in the Prime Rate or the
Federal Funds Rate, respectively.

         "Alternate Base Rate Loans" means Loans that bear interest at an
interest rate based on the Alternate Base Rate.

         "Applicable Percentage" means for any day, the rate per annum set forth
below opposite the applicable rating for the Borrower's senior unsecured
(non-credit enhanced) long term debt as determined by S&P and Moody's (the "Debt
Rating") then in effect, it being understood that the Applicable Percentage for
(i) Alternate Base Rate Loans shall be the percentage set forth under the column
"Alternate Base Rate Margin", (ii) LIBOR Rate Loans shall be the percentage set
forth under the column "LIBOR Margin", (iii) the Facility Fee shall be the
percentage set forth under the column "Facility Fee" and (iv) the Utilization
Fee shall be the percentage set forth under the column "Utilization Fee":

         (a)      Commitment. During the Commitment Period, subject to the terms
and conditions hereof, each Lender severally agrees to make revolving credit
loans in Dollars (the "Revolving Loans") to the Borrower from time to time in
the amount of such Lender's Commitment Percentage of such Revolving Loans for
the purposes hereinafter set forth; provided that (i) with regard to the Lenders
collectively, the aggregate principal amount of Loans outstanding at any time
shall not exceed the Aggregate Revolving Committed Amount, and (ii) with regard
to each Lender individually, the aggregate principal amount of such Lender's
Commitment Percentage of Revolving Loans outstanding at any time shall not
exceed such Lender's Revolving Committed Amount. Revolving Loans may consist of
Alternate Base Rate Loans or LIBOR Rate Loans, or a combination thereof, as the
Borrower may request, and may be repaid and reborrowed in accordance with the
provisions hereof.

         (b)      Revolving Loan Borrowings.

                  (i)      Notice of Borrowing. The Borrower shall request a
         Revolving Loan borrowing by written notice (or telephone notice
         promptly confirmed in writing) to the Administrative Agent not later
         than 11:00 A.M. on the day of the requested borrowing, which shall be a
         Business Day, in the case of Alternate Base Rate Loans, and on the
         third Business Day prior to the date of the requested borrowing in the
         case of LIBOR Rate Loans. Each such request for borrowing shall be
         irrevocable and shall specify (A) that a Revolving Loan is requested,
         (B) the date of the requested borrowing (which shall be a Business
         Day), (C) the aggregate principal amount to be borrowed, and (D)
         whether the

                                       20

<PAGE>

         borrowing shall be comprised of Alternate Base Rate Loans, LIBOR Rate
         Loans or a combination thereof, and if LIBOR Rate Loans are requested,
         the Interest Period(s) therefor. If the Borrower shall fail to specify
         in any such Notice of Borrowing (I) an applicable Interest Period in
         the case of a LIBOR Rate Loan, then such notice shall be deemed to be a
         request for an Interest Period of one month, or (II) the type of
         Revolving Loan requested, then such notice shall be deemed to be a
         request for a Alternate Base Rate Loan hereunder. The Administrative
         Agent shall give notice to each Lender promptly upon receipt of each
         Notice of Borrowing pursuant to this Section 2.1(b)(i), the contents
         thereof and each such Lender's share of any borrowing to be made
         pursuant thereto.

                  (ii)     Minimum Amounts. Each Revolving Loan shall be in a
         minimum aggregate principal amount of (A) in the case of LIBOR Rate
         Loans, $5,000,000 and integral multiples of $1,000,000 in excess
         thereof (or the remaining amount of the Revolving Committed Amount, if
         less) or (B) in the case of Alternate Base Rate Loans, $1,000,000 and
         integral multiples of $1,000,000 in excess thereof (or the remaining
         amount of the Revolving Committed Amount, if less).

                  (iii)    Advances. Each Lender will make its Commitment
         Percentage of each Revolving Loan borrowing available to the
         Administrative Agent for the account of the Borrower at the office of
         the Administrative Agent specified in Section 10.2, or at such office
         as the Administrative Agent may designate in writing, by 1:00 p.m. on
         the date specified in the applicable Notice of Borrowing in Dollars and
         in funds immediately available to the Administrative Agent. Such
         borrowing will then be made available to the Borrower by the
         Administrative Agent by crediting the account designated by the
         Borrower with the aggregate of the amounts made available to the
         Administrative Agent by the Lenders and in like funds as received by
         the Administrative Agent.

         (c)      Repayment.  The principal amount of all Loans shall be due and
payable in full on the Maturity Date.

         (d)      Interest.  Subject to the provisions of Section 3.1:

                  (i)      Alternate Base Rate Loans. During such periods as
         Revolving Loans shall be comprised in whole or in part of Alternate
         Base Rate Loans, such Alternate Base Rate Loans shall bear interest at
         a per annum rate equal to the Alternate Base Rate plus the Applicable
         Percentage;

                  (ii)     LIBOR Rate Loans. During such periods as Revolving
         Loans shall be comprised in whole or in part of LIBOR Rate Loans, such
         LIBOR Rate Loans shall bear interest at a per annum rate equal to the
         LIBOR Rate plus the Applicable Percentage.

Interest on Revolving Loans shall be payable in arrears on each applicable
Interest Payment Date (or at such other times as may be specified herein).

                                       21

<PAGE>

         (e)      Revolving  Notes.  The Revolving  Loans shall be evidenced by
a duly executed Revolving Note in favor of each Lender in the form of Schedule
2.1(e) attached hereto.

         (f)      Maximum Number of LIBOR Rate Loans. The Borrower will be
limited to a maximum number of eight (8) LIBOR Rate Loans outstanding at any
time. For purposes hereof, LIBOR Rate Loans with separate or different Interest
Periods will be considered as separate LIBOR Rate Loans even if their Interest
Periods expire on the same date.

                                    SECTION 3
                 OTHER PROVISIONS RELATING TO CREDIT FACILITIES

         3.1      Default Rate.

         Upon the occurrence, and during the continuance, of an Event of
Default, the principal of and, to the extent permitted by law, interest on the
Loans and any other amounts owing hereunder or under the other Credit Documents
shall bear interest, payable on demand, at a per annum rate 2% greater than the
interest rate which would otherwise be applicable (or if no rate is applicable,
whether in respect of interest, fees or other amounts, then 2% greater than the
Alternate Base Rate plus the Applicable Percentage).

         3.2      Extension and Conversion.

         The Borrower shall have the option, on any Business Day, to extend
existing Loans into a subsequent permissible Interest Period or to convert Loans
into Loans of another interest rate type; provided, however, that (i) except as
expressly provided otherwise in this Credit Agreement, LIBOR Rate Loans may be
converted into Alternate Base Rate Loans only on the last day of the Interest
Period applicable thereto, (ii) LIBOR Rate Loans may be extended, and Alternate
Base Rate Loans may be converted into LIBOR Rate Loans, only if the conditions
in Section 4.2 have been satisfied, (iii) Loans extended as, or converted into,
LIBOR Rate Loans shall be subject to the terms of the definition of "Interest
Period" set forth in Section 1.1 and shall be in such minimum amounts as
provided in Section 2.1(b)(ii), and (iv) any request for extension or conversion
of a LIBOR Rate Loan which shall fail to specify an Interest Period shall be
deemed to be a request for an Interest Period of one month. Each such extension
or conversion shall be effected by the Borrower by giving a Notice of
Extension/Conversion (or telephone notice promptly confirmed in writing) to the
Administrative Agent prior to 11:00 A.M. on the Business Day of, in the case of
the conversion of a LIBOR Rate Loan into a Alternate Base Rate Loan, and on the
third Business Day prior to, in the case of the extension of a LIBOR Rate Loan
as, or conversion of a Alternate Base Rate Loan into, a LIBOR Rate Loan, the
date of the proposed extension or conversion, specifying (A) the date of the
proposed extension or conversion, (B) the Loans to be so extended or converted,
(C) the types of Loans into which such Loans are to be converted and, if
appropriate, (D) the applicable Interest Periods with respect thereto. Each
request for extension or conversion shall be irrevocable and shall constitute a
representation and warranty by the Borrower of the matters specified in Section
4.2. In the event the Borrower fails to request extension or conversion of any
LIBOR Rate Loan in accordance with this Section, or any such conversion or
extension is not permitted or required by this Section, then such LIBOR Rate
Loan shall be continued as a LIBOR Rate Loan at the end of the

                                       22

<PAGE>

Interest Period applicable thereto for an Interest Period of one month. The
Administrative Agent shall give each Lender notice as promptly as practicable of
any such proposed extension or conversion affecting any Loan.

         3.3      Prepayments.

         (a)      Voluntary Prepayments. Revolving Loans may be repaid in whole
or in part without premium or penalty; provided that (i) LIBOR Rate Loans may be
prepaid only upon three (3) Business Days' prior written notice to the
Administrative Agent, and Alternate Base Rate Loans may be prepaid only upon at
least one (1) Business Day's prior written notice to the Administrative Agent,
(ii) prepayments of LIBOR Rate Loans must be accompanied by payment of any
amounts owing under Section 3.12, and (iii) partial prepayments shall be in
minimum principal amount of $10,000,000, and in integral multiples of $1,000,000
in excess thereof.

         (b)      Mandatory Prepayments. If at any time, the aggregate principal
amount of Loans shall exceed the Aggregate Revolving Committed Amount, the
Borrower shall immediately make payment on the Loans in an amount sufficient to
eliminate the deficiency.

         (c)      Application. Unless otherwise specified by the Borrower,
prepayments made hereunder shall be applied first to Alternate Base Rate Loans
and then to LIBOR Rate Loans in direct order of Interest Period maturities.
Amounts prepaid hereunder may be reborrowed in accordance with the provisions
hereof.

         3.4      Termination, Reduction and Increase of Commitments

         (a)      Voluntary Reductions. The Commitments may be terminated or
permanently reduced by the Borrower in whole or in part upon three (3) Business
Days' prior written notice to the Administrative Agent; provided that (i) after
giving effect to any voluntary reduction, the aggregate principal amount of
Loans shall not exceed the Aggregate Revolving Committed Amount, as reduced, and
(ii) partial reductions shall be in minimum principal amounts of $10,000,000,
and in integral multiples of $1,000,000 in excess thereof.

         (b)      Mandatory Reduction. The Commitments hereunder shall terminate
on the Maturity Date.

         (c)      Increase in Commitments. The Borrower shall have the right
upon at least fifteen (15) Business Days' prior written notice to the
Administrative Agent to increase the Aggregate Revolving Committed Amount by up
to $25,000,000, in a single increase, at any time on or after the Closing Date,
subject, however, in any such case, to satisfaction of the following conditions
precedent:

                  (i)      no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred
         and be continuing on the date on which such Aggregate Revolving
         Committed Amount increase is to become effective;

                                       23

<PAGE>

                  (ii)     the representations and warranties set forth in
         Section 5 of this Credit Agreement shall be true and correct in all
         material respects on and as of the date on which such Aggregate
         Revolving Committed Amount increase is to become effective (except to
         the extent they expressly relate to an earlier date);

                  (iii)    on or before the date on which such Aggregate
         Revolving Committed Amount increase is to become effective, the
         Administrative Agent shall have received, for its own account, the
         mutually acceptable fees and expenses required by separate agreement of
         the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to be paid in connection with
         such increase;

                  (iv)     such Aggregate Revolving Committed Amount increase
         shall be an integral multiple of $5,000,000 and shall in no event be
         less than $5,000,000; and

                  (v)      such requested Aggregate Revolving Commitment
         increase shall be effective on such date only to the extent that, on or
         before such date, (A) the Administrative Agent shall have received and
         accepted a corresponding amount of Additional Commitment(s) pursuant to
         a commitment letter(s) acceptable to the Administrative Agent from one
         or more Lenders acceptable to the Administrative Agent and, with
         respect to any Lender that is not at such time a Lender hereunder, to
         the Borrower and (B) each such Lender has executed an agreement in the
         form of Schedule 3.4(c) hereto (each such agreement a "New Commitment
         Agreement"), accepted in writing therein by the Administrative Agent
         and, with respect to any Lender that is not at such time a Lender
         hereunder, by the Borrower, with respect to the Additional Commitment
         of such Lender.

         3.5      Fees.

         (a)      Facility Fee. In consideration of the Commitments hereunder,
the Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the ratable benefit
of the Lenders a facility fee (the "Facility Fee") equal to the Applicable
Percentage per annum, prior to the Maturity Date, on the average daily Aggregate
Revolving Committed Amount in effect from time to time, and after the Maturity
Date, on the average daily aggregate Revolving Loans outstanding. The Facility
Fee shall be payable quarterly in arrears on the 15th day following the last day
of each calendar quarter for the immediately preceding quarter (or portion
thereof) beginning with the first such date to occur after the Closing Date and
on the Maturity Date.

         (b)      Utilization Fee. For each day that the principal amount of
outstanding Loans hereunder is equal to or shall exceed an amount equal to fifty
percent (50%) of the then Aggregate Revolving Committed Amount, the Borrower
shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the pro rata benefit of the Lenders, a
per annum fee equal to one-eighth of one percent (.125%) on the Utilized
Commitment for such day (the "Utilization Fees"). The Utilization Fees, if any,
shall be due and payable in arrears on the first Business Day after the end of
each fiscal quarter of the Borrower (as well as on the Maturity Date and on any
date that the Commitment is reduced) for the immediately preceding fiscal
quarter (or portion thereof), beginning with the first of such dates to occur
after the Closing Date.

                                       24

<PAGE>

         (c)      Administrative Agent's Fees. The Borrower agrees to pay to the
Administrative Agent, for its own account, an annual administrative fee and such
other fees, if any, referred to in the Fee Letter (collectively, the
"Administrative Agent's Fees").

         3.6      Computation of Interest and Fees.

                  (a)      Interest payable hereunder with respect to Alternate
         Base Rate Loans based on the Prime Rate shall be calculated on the
         basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days, as applicable) for the actual
         days elapsed. All other fees, interest and all other amounts payable
         hereunder shall be calculated on the basis of a 360 day year for the
         actual days elapsed. The Administrative Agent shall as soon as
         practicable notify the Borrower and the Lenders of each determination
         of a LIBOR Rate on the Business Day of the determination thereof. Any
         change in the interest rate on a Loan resulting from a change in the
         Alternate Base Rate shall become effective as of the opening of
         business on the day on which such change in the Alternate Base Rate
         shall become effective. The Administrative Agent shall as soon as
         practicable notify the Borrower and the Lenders of the effective date
         and the amount of each such change.

                  (b)      Each determination of an interest rate by the
         Administrative Agent pursuant to any provision of this Credit Agreement
         shall be conclusive and binding on the Borrower and the Lenders in the
         absence of manifest error. The Administrative Agent shall, at the
         request of the Borrower, deliver to the Borrower a statement showing
         the computations used by the Administrative Agent in determining any
         interest rate.

                  3.7      Pro Rata Treatment and Payments.

                  (a)      Each borrowing of Revolving Loans and any reduction
         of the Commitments shall be made pro rata according to the respective
         Commitment Percentages of the Lenders. Each payment under this Credit
         Agreement or any Note shall be applied (i) first, to any Fees then due
         and owing, (ii) second, to interest then due and owing in respect of
         the Notes of the Borrower and (iii) third, to principal then due and
         owing hereunder and under the Notes of the Borrower. Each payment on
         account of any Fees pursuant to Sections 3.5(a) and (b) shall be made
         pro rata in accordance with the respective amounts due and owing. Each
         payment (other than prepayments) by the Borrower on account of
         principal of and interest on the Revolving Loans shall be made pro rata
         according to the respective amounts due and owing hereunder.
         Prepayments made pursuant to Section 3.3 shall be applied in accordance
         with such section. Each optional prepayment on account of principal of
         the Loans shall be applied in accordance with Section 3.3 and each
         mandatory prepayment on account of principal of the Loans shall be
         applied in accordance with Section 3.3. All payments (including
         prepayments) to be made by the Borrower on account of principal,
         interest and fees shall be made without defense, set-off or
         counterclaim (except as provided in Section 3.13(b)) and shall be made
         to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders at the
         Administrative Agent's office specified in Section 10.2 in Dollars and
         in immediately available funds not later than 1:00 P.M. on the date
         when due. The Administrative Agent shall distribute

                                       25

<PAGE>

         such payments to the Lenders entitled thereto promptly upon receipt in
         like funds as received. If any payment hereunder (other than payments
         on the LIBOR Rate Loans) becomes due and payable on a day other than a
         Business Day, such payment shall be extended to the next succeeding
         Business Day, and, with respect to payments of principal, interest
         thereon shall be payable at the then applicable rate during such
         extension. If any payment on a LIBOR Rate Loan becomes due and payable
         on a day other than a Business Day, the maturity thereof shall be
         extended to the next succeeding Business Day unless the result of such
         extension would be to extend such payment into another calendar month,
         in which event such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding
         Business Day.

                  (b)      Allocation of Payments After Event of Default.
         Notwithstanding any other provision of this Credit Agreement to the
         contrary, after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event
         of Default, all amounts collected or received by the Administrative
         Agent or any Lender on account of the Credit Party Obligations or any
         other amounts outstanding under any of the Credit Documents shall be
         paid over or delivered as follows:

                           FIRST, to the payment of all reasonable out-of-pocket
                  costs and expenses (including without limitation reasonable
                  attorneys' fees) of the Administrative Agent in connection
                  with enforcing the rights of the Lenders under the Credit
                  Documents;

                           SECOND, to payment of any fees owed to the
                  Administrative Agent;

                           THIRD, to the payment of all reasonable out-of-pocket
                  costs and expenses (including without limitation, reasonable
                  attorneys' fees) of each of the Lenders in connection with
                  enforcing its rights under the Credit Documents or otherwise
                  with respect to the Credit Party Obligations owing to such
                  Lender;

                           FOURTH, to the payment of all of the Credit Party
                  Obligations consisting of accrued fees and interest
                  (including, without limitation, accrued fees and interest
                  arising under any Hedging Agreement between any Credit Party
                  and any Lender, or any Affiliate of a Lender);

                           FIFTH, to the payment of the outstanding principal
                  amount of the Credit Party Obligations (including, without
                  limitation, the outstanding principal amount arising under any
                  Hedging Agreement between any Credit Party and any Lender, or
                  any Affiliate of a Lender, to the extent such Hedging
                  Agreement is permitted by Section 7.1(e));

                           SIXTH, to all other Credit Party Obligations and
                  other obligations which shall have become due and payable
                  under the Credit Documents or otherwise and not repaid
                  pursuant to clauses "FIRST" through "FIFTH" above; and

                                       26

<PAGE>

                           SEVENTH, to the payment of the surplus, if any, to
                  whoever may be lawfully entitled to receive such surplus.

                  In carrying out the foregoing, (i) amounts received shall be
                  applied in the numerical order provided until exhausted prior
                  to application to the next succeeding category and (ii) each
                  of the Lenders shall receive an amount equal to its pro rata
                  share (based on the proportion that the then outstanding Loans
                  held by such Lender bears to the aggregate then outstanding
                  Loans) of amounts available to be applied pursuant to clauses
                  "THIRD", "FOURTH", "FIFTH" and "SIXTH" above.

                  3.8      Non-Receipt of Funds by the Administrative Agent.

                  (a)      Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been
         notified in writing by a Lender prior to the date a Loan is to be made
         by such Lender (which notice shall be effective upon receipt) that such
         Lender does not intend to make the proceeds of such Loan available to
         the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may assume that such
         Lender has made such proceeds available to the Administrative Agent on
         such date, and the Administrative Agent may in reliance upon such
         assumption (but shall not be required to) make available to the
         Borrower a corresponding amount. If such corresponding amount is not in
         fact made available to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative
         Agent shall be able to recover such corresponding amount from such
         Lender. If such Lender does not pay such corresponding amount forthwith
         upon the Administrative Agent's demand therefor, the Administrative
         Agent will promptly notify the Borrower, and the Borrower shall
         immediately pay such corresponding amount to the Administrative Agent.
         The Administrative Agent shall also be entitled to recover from the
         Lender or the Borrower, as the case may be, interest on such
         corresponding amount in respect of each day from the date such
         corresponding amount was made available by the Administrative Agent to
         the Borrower to the date such corresponding amount is recovered by the
         Administrative Agent at a per annum rate equal to (i) from the Borrower
         at the applicable rate for the applicable borrowing pursuant to the
         Notice of Borrowing and (ii) from a Lender at the Federal Funds Rate.

                  (b)      Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been
         notified in writing by the Borrower, prior to the date on which any
         payment is due from it hereunder (which notice shall be effective upon
         receipt) that the Borrower does not intend to make such payment, the
         Administrative Agent may assume that such Borrower has made such
         payment when due, and the Administrative Agent may in reliance upon
         such assumption (but shall not be required to) make available to each
         Lender on such payment date an amount equal to the portion of such
         assumed payment to which such Lender is entitled hereunder, and if the
         Borrower has not in fact made such payment to the Administrative Agent,
         such Lender shall, on demand, repay to the Administrative Agent the
         amount made available to such Lender. If such amount is repaid to the
         Administrative Agent on a date after the date such amount was made
         available to such Lender, such Lender shall pay to the Administrative
         Agent on demand interest on such amount in respect of each day from the
         date such amount was made available by the Administrative Agent to such
         Lender to the

                                       27

<PAGE>

         date such amount is recovered by the Administrative Agent at a per
         annum rate equal to the Federal Funds Rate.

                  (c)      A certificate of the Administrative Agent submitted
         to the Borrower or any Lender with respect to any amount owing under
         this Section 3.8 shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.

                  3.9      Inability to Determine Interest Rate.

         Notwithstanding any other provision of this Credit Agreement, if (i)
the Administrative Agent shall reasonably determine (which determination shall
be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that, by reason of
circumstances affecting the relevant market, reasonable and adequate means do
not exist for ascertaining LIBOR for such Interest Period, or (ii) the Required
Lenders shall reasonably determine (which determination shall be conclusive and
binding absent manifest error) that the LIBOR Rate does not adequately and
fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding LIBOR Rate Loans that the
Borrower has requested be outstanding as a LIBOR tranche during such Interest
Period, the Administrative Agent shall forthwith give telephone notice of such
determination, confirmed in writing, to the Borrower, and the Lenders at least
two Business Days prior to the first day of such Interest Period. Unless the
Borrower shall have notified the Administrative Agent upon receipt of such
telephone notice that it wishes to rescind or modify its request regarding such
LIBOR Rate Loans, any Loans that were requested to be made as LIBOR Rate Loans
shall be made as Alternate Base Rate Loans and any Loans that were requested to
be converted into or continued as LIBOR Rate Loans shall remain as or be
converted into Alternate Base Rate Loans. Until any such notice has been
withdrawn by the Administrative Agent, no further Loans shall be made as,
continued as, or converted into, LIBOR Rate Loans for the Interest Periods so
affected.

                  3.10     Illegality.

         Notwithstanding any other provision of this Credit Agreement, if the
adoption of or any change in any Requirement of Law or in the interpretation or
application thereof by the relevant Governmental Authority to any Lender shall
make it unlawful for such Lender or its LIBOR Lending Office to make or maintain
LIBOR Rate Loans as contemplated by this Credit Agreement or to obtain in the
interbank eurodollar market through its LIBOR Lending Office the funds with
which to make such Loans, (a) such Lender shall promptly notify the
Administrative Agent and the Borrower thereof, (b) the commitment of such Lender
hereunder to make LIBOR Rate Loans or continue LIBOR Rate Loans as such shall
forthwith be suspended until the Administrative Agent shall give notice that the
condition or situation which gave rise to the suspension shall no longer exist,
and (c) such Lender's Loans then outstanding as LIBOR Rate Loans, if any, shall
be converted on the last day of the Interest Period for such Loans or within
such earlier period as required by law to Alternate Base Rate Loans. The
Borrower hereby agrees promptly to pay any Lender, upon its demand, any
additional amounts necessary to compensate such Lender for actual and direct
costs (but not including anticipated profits) reasonably incurred by such Lender
including, but not limited to, any interest or fees payable by such Lender to
lenders of funds obtained by it in order to make or maintain its LIBOR Rate
Loans hereunder. A certificate as to any additional amounts payable pursuant to
this Section

                                       28

<PAGE>

submitted by such Lender, through the Administrative Agent, to the
Borrower shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. Each Lender
agrees to use reasonable efforts (including reasonable efforts to change its
LIBOR Lending Office) to avoid or to minimize any amounts which may otherwise be
payable pursuant to this Section; provided, however, that such efforts shall not
cause the imposition on such Lender of any additional costs or legal or
regulatory burdens deemed by such Lender in its reasonable discretion to be
material.

                  3.11     Requirements of Law.

                  (a)      If the adoption of or any change in any Requirement
         of Law or in the interpretation or application thereof or compliance by
         any Lender with any request or directive (whether or not having the
         force of law) from any central bank or other Governmental Authority
         made subsequent to the date hereof:

                           (i)      shall subject such Lender to any tax of any
                  kind whatsoever with respect to any LIBOR Rate Loan made by
                  it, or change the basis of taxation of payments to such Lender
                  in respect thereof (except for changes in the rate of tax on
                  the overall net income of such Lender);

                           (ii)     shall impose, modify or hold applicable any
                  reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan or similar
                  requirement against assets held by, deposits or other
                  liabilities in or for the account of, advances, loans or other
                  extensions of credit by, or any other acquisition of funds by,
                  any office of such Lender which is not otherwise included in
                  the determination of the LIBOR Rate hereunder; or

                           (iii)    shall impose on such Lender any other
                  condition;

                  and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost
         to such Lender of making or maintaining LIBOR Rate Loans or to reduce
         any amount receivable hereunder or under any Note, then, in any such
         case, the Borrower shall promptly pay such Lender, upon its demand, any
         additional amounts necessary to compensate such Lender for such
         additional cost or reduced amount receivable which such Lender
         reasonably deems to be material as determined by such Lender with
         respect to its LIBOR Rate Loans. A certificate as to any additional
         amounts payable pursuant to this Section submitted by such Lender,
         through the Administrative Agent, to the Borrower shall be conclusive
         in the absence of manifest error. Each Lender agrees to use reasonable
         efforts (including reasonable efforts to change its LIBOR Lending
         Office, as the case may be) to avoid or to minimize any amounts which
         might otherwise be payable pursuant to this paragraph of this Section;
         provided, however, that such efforts shall not cause the imposition on
         such Lender of any additional costs or legal or regulatory burdens
         deemed by such Lender in its reasonable discretion to be material.

                  (b)      If (i) any Lender shall have reasonably determined
         that the adoption of or any change in any Requirement of Law regarding
         capital adequacy or in the interpretation or application thereof or
         compliance by such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender
         with any request or directive regarding capital adequacy

                                       29
<PAGE>
         (whether or not having the force of law) from any central bank or
         Governmental Authority made subsequent to the date hereof does or shall
         have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or such
         corporation's capital as a consequence of its obligations hereunder to
         a level below that which such Lender or such corporation could have
         achieved but for such adoption, change or compliance (taking into
         consideration such Lender's or such corporation's policies with respect
         to capital adequacy) by an amount reasonably deemed by such Lender in
         its sole discretion to be material and (ii) such Lender shall provide
         the Borrower, within thirty (30) days following its determination that
         such a reduction in its rate of return has occurred, with a certificate
         demanding such additional amount (the "Shortfall Amount") as shall be
         certified by such Lender as being required to compensate it for such
         reduction, within fifteen (15) days after demand by such Lender, the
         Borrower shall pay to such Lender the Shortfall Amount. Such a
         certificate as to any additional amounts payable under this Section
         submitted by a Lender (which certificate shall include a description of
         the basis for the computation), through the Administrative Agent, to
         the Borrower shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

                  (c)      The agreements in this Section 3.11 shall survive the
         termination of this Credit Agreement and payment of the Notes and all
         other amounts payable hereunder.

                  3.12     Indemnity.

         The Borrower hereby agrees to indemnify each Lender and to hold such
Lender harmless from any funding loss or expense which such Lender may sustain
or incur as a consequence of (a) default by the Borrower in payment of the
principal amount of or interest on any Loan by such Lender in accordance with
the terms hereof, (b) default by the Borrower in accepting a borrowing after the
Borrower has given a notice in accordance with the terms hereof, (c) default by
the Borrower in making any prepayment after the Borrower has given a notice in
accordance with the terms hereof, and/or (d) the making by the Borrower of a
prepayment of a Loan, or the conversion thereof, on a day which is not the last
day of the Interest Period with respect thereto, in each case including, but not
limited to, any such loss or expense arising from interest or fees payable by
such Lender to lenders of funds obtained by it in order to maintain its Loans
hereunder. A certificate as to any additional amounts payable pursuant to this
Section submitted by any Lender, through the Administrative Agent, to the
Borrower (which certificate must be delivered to the Administrative Agent within
thirty days following such default, prepayment or conversion) shall be
conclusive in the absence of manifest error. The agreements in this Section
shall survive termination of this Credit Agreement and payment of the Notes and
all other amounts payable hereunder.

                  3.13     Taxes.

                  (a)      All payments made by the Borrower hereunder or under
         any Note will be, except as provided in Section 3.13(b), made free and
         clear of, and without deduction or withholding for, any present or
         future taxes, levies, imposts, duties, fees, assessments or other
         charges of whatever nature now or hereafter imposed by any Governmental
         Authority or by any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof
         or therein with

                                       30

<PAGE>

         respect to such payments (but excluding any tax imposed on or measured
         by the net income or profits of a Lender pursuant to the laws of the
         jurisdiction in which it is organized or the jurisdiction in which the
         principal office or applicable lending office of such Lender is located
         or any subdivision thereof or therein) and all interest, penalties or
         similar liabilities with respect thereto (all such non-excluded taxes,
         levies, imposts, duties, fees, assessments or other charges being
         referred to collectively as "Taxes"). If any Taxes are so levied or
         imposed, the Borrower agrees to pay the full amount of such Taxes, and
         such additional amounts as may be necessary so that every payment of
         all amounts due under this Credit Agreement or under any Note, after
         withholding or deduction for or on account of any Taxes, will not be
         less than the amount provided for herein or in such Note. The Borrower
         will furnish to the Administrative Agent as soon as practicable after
         the date the payment of any Taxes is due pursuant to applicable law
         certified copies (to the extent reasonably available and required by
         law) of tax receipts evidencing such payment by the Borrower. The
         Borrower agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Lender, and
         reimburse such Lender upon its written request, for the amount of any
         Taxes so levied or imposed and paid by such Lender.

                  (b)      Each Lender that is not a United States person (as
         such term is defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) agrees to
         deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the
         Closing Date, or in the case of a Lender that is an assignee or
         transferee of an interest under this Credit Agreement pursuant to
         Section 10.6 (unless the respective Lender was already a Lender
         hereunder immediately prior to such assignment or transfer), on the
         date of such assignment or transfer to such Lender, (i) if the Lender
         is a "bank" within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, two
         accurate and complete original signed copies of Internal Revenue
         Service Form 4224 or 1001 (or successor forms) certifying such Lender's
         entitlement to a complete exemption from United States withholding tax
         with respect to payments to be made under this Credit Agreement and
         under any Note, or (ii) if the Lender is not a "bank" within the
         meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, either Internal Revenue
         Service Form 1001 or 4224 as set forth in clause (i) above, or (x) a
         certificate substantially in the form of Schedule 3.13 (any such
         certificate, a "3.13 Certificate") and (y) two accurate and complete
         original signed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8 (or
         successor form) certifying such Lender's entitlement to an exemption
         from United States withholding tax with respect to payments of interest
         to be made under this Credit Agreement and under any Note. In addition,
         each Lender agrees that it will deliver upon the Borrower's request
         updated versions of the foregoing, as applicable, whenever the previous
         certification has become obsolete or inaccurate in any material
         respect, together with such other forms as may be required in order to
         confirm or establish the entitlement of such Lender to a continued
         exemption from or reduction in United States withholding tax with
         respect to payments under this Credit Agreement and any Note.
         Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 3.13(a),
         but subject to the immediately succeeding sentence, (x) the Borrower
         shall be entitled, to the extent it is required to do so by law, to
         deduct or withhold Taxes imposed by the United States (or any political
         subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein) from interest, fees
         or other amounts payable hereunder for the account of any Lender which
         is not a United States person (as such term is defined in Section
         7701(a)(30) of the Code) for U.S. Federal income tax

                                       31

<PAGE>

         purposes to the extent that such Lender has not provided to the
         Borrower U.S. Internal Revenue Service Forms that establish a complete
         exemption from such deduction or withholding and (y) the Borrower shall
         not be obligated pursuant to Section 3.13(a) hereof to gross-up
         payments to be made to a Lender in respect of Taxes imposed by the
         United States if (I) such Lender has not provided to the Borrower the
         Internal Revenue Service Forms required to be provided to the Borrower
         pursuant to this Section 3.13(b) or (II) in the case of a payment,
         other than interest, to a Lender described in clause (ii) above, to the
         extent that such Forms do not establish a complete exemption from
         withholding of such Taxes. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
         contained in the preceding sentence or elsewhere in this Section 3.13,
         the Borrower agrees to pay additional amounts and to indemnify each
         Lender in the manner set forth in Section 3.13(a) (without regard to
         the identity of the jurisdiction requiring the deduction or
         withholding) in respect of any amounts deducted or withheld by it as
         described in the immediately preceding sentence as a result of any
         changes after the Closing Date in any applicable law, treaty,
         governmental rule, regulation, guideline or order, or in the
         interpretation thereof, relating to the deducting or withholding of
         Taxes.

                  (c)      Each Lender agrees to use reasonable efforts
         (including reasonable efforts to change its LIBOR Lending Office, as
         the case may be) to avoid or to minimize any amounts which might
         otherwise be payable pursuant to this Section; provided, however, that
         such efforts shall not cause the imposition on such Lender of any
         additional costs or legal or regulatory burdens deemed by such Lender
         in its reasonable discretion to be material.

                  (d)      If the Borrower pays any additional amount pursuant
         to this Section 3.13 with respect to a Lender, such Lender shall use
         reasonable efforts to obtain a refund of tax or credit against its tax
         liabilities on account of such payment; provided that such Lender shall
         have no obligation to use such reasonable efforts if either (i) it is
         in an excess foreign tax credit position or (ii) it believes in good
         faith, in its sole discretion, that claiming a refund or credit would
         cause adverse tax consequences to it. In the event that such Lender
         receives such a refund or credit, such Lender shall pay to the Borrower
         an amount that such Lender reasonably determines is equal to the net
         tax benefit obtained by such Lender as a result of such payment by the
         Borrower. In the event that no refund or credit is obtained with
         respect to the Borrower's payments to such Lender pursuant to this
         Section 3.13, then such Lender shall upon request provide a
         certification that such Lender has not received a refund or credit for
         such payments. Nothing contained in this Section 3.13 shall require a
         Lender to disclose or detail the basis of its calculation of the amount
         of any tax benefit or any other amount or the basis of its
         determination referred to in the proviso to the first sentence of this
         Section 3.13 to the Borrower or any other party.

                  (e)      The agreements in this Section 3.13 shall survive the
         termination of this Credit Agreement and the payment of the Notes and
         all other amounts payable hereunder.

the twelve-month period ending on the last day of the last complete calendar

         (m)      Existing Indebtedness. All of the existing Indebtedness for
borrowed money of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries (other than Indebtedness
permitted to exist pursuant to Section 7.1) shall be repaid in full and
terminated and all security interests and Liens related thereto (if any) shall
be terminated and released on the Closing Date.

         (n)      Consents. The Administrative Agent shall have received
evidence that all necessary governmental, corporate, shareholder and third party

         The obligation of each Lender to make any Loan hereunder (including the
initial Loans to be made hereunder) is subject to the satisfaction of the
following conditions precedent on the date of making such Loan:

         (a)      Representations and Warranties. The representations and
warranties made by any Credit Party herein or in any other Credit Document or
which are contained in any certificate furnished at any time under or in

         Each request for a Loan (including extensions and conversions) and each
acceptance by the Borrower of a Loan (including extensions and conversions)
shall be deemed to constitute a representation and warranty by each of the
Credit Parties as of the date of such Loan that the conditions in subsections
(a) and (b) of this Section have been satisfied.

                                    SECTION 5
                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

         To induce the Lenders to enter into this Credit Agreement and to make

warrants to the Administrative Agent and to each Lender that:

                                       35

         5.1      Financial Condition.

         (a)      Each of the financial statements described below (copies of
which have heretofore been provided to the Administrative Agent for distribution
to the Lenders), have been prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently applied
throughout the periods covered thereby, and present fairly in all material
respects the financial condition and results from operations of the entities and
for the periods specified, subject in the case of interim company-prepared
statements to normal year-end adjustments:

                  (i)      audited consolidated balance sheet of the Borrower
         and its consolidated Subsidiaries dated as of December 31, 2000,
         together with related statements of income and cash flows certified by
         Deloitte & Touche LLP, certified public accountants; and

                  (ii)     a company-prepared consolidated condensed balance
         sheet of the Borrower and its consolidated Subsidiaries dated as of
         December 31, 2001, together with related consolidated condensed
         statements of income and cash flows for the period from January 1, 2001
         through December 31, 2001.

         (b)      The three-year financial and operations projections of the
Borrower and its Subsidiaries have been prepared in good faith based upon
assumptions believed by the Borrower to be reasonable at the time made.

         5.2      No Material Adverse Change.

         Except as set forth on Schedule 4.1(j), since December 31, 2000, there
has not occurred a change in the business, assets, liabilities (financial or
otherwise) of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole which is
reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect (other than as has been
publicly disclosed from December 31, 2000 to January 24, 2002 in filings with
the Securities and Exchange Commission or in press releases made by the Borrower
in financial publications that have been widely distributed (e.g. PR Newswire or
Dow Jones Newswire) or through publication on the Borrower's website).

         5.3      Organization; Existence.

         Each Credit Party (a) is duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, (b) has the
corporate or other necessary power and authority, and the legal right to own and
operate its property, to lease the property it operates as lessee and to conduct
the business in which it is currently engaged and (c) is duly qualified as a
foreign entity and in good standing under the laws of each jurisdiction where
its ownership, lease or operation of property or the conduct of its business
requires such qualification, other than in such jurisdictions where the failure
to be so qualified and in good standing would not, in the aggregate, have a
Material Adverse Effect.

                                       36

<PAGE>

         5.4      Power; Authorization; Enforceable Obligations.

         Each Credit Party has the corporate or other necessary power and
authority, and the legal right, to make, deliver and perform the Credit
Documents to which it is a party and has taken all necessary corporate or other
action to authorize the execution, delivery and performance by it of the Credit
Documents to which it is a party. No consent or authorization of, filing with,
notice to or other act by or in respect of, any Governmental Authority or any
other Person is required in connection with acceptance of extensions of credit
by the Borrower or the making of the guaranties hereunder or with the execution,
delivery or performance of any Credit Documents by the Credit Parties (other
than those which have been obtained) or with the validity or enforceability of
any Credit Document against the Credit Parties. Each Credit Document to which it
is a party constitutes a valid and legally binding obligation of each Credit
Party enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy,
insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of
general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to general
equity principles.

         5.5      Conflict.

         The execution, delivery and performance of the Credit Documents, the
borrowings hereunder and the use of the proceeds of the Loans will not (a)
violate any Requirement of Law applicable to the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries (except those as to which waivers or consents have been obtained),
(b) conflict with, result in a breach of or constitute a default under (i) the
articles of incorporation, bylaws or other organizational documents of such
Person, (ii) any material indenture, agreement or other instrument to which such
Person is a party or by which any of its properties may be bound or (iii) any
approval of any Governmental Authority relating to such Person, or (c) result
in, or require, the creation or imposition of any Lien on any of their
respective properties or revenues pursuant to any Requirement of Law or any
Material Contract.

         5.6      No Material Litigation.

         No claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding of or before any
arbitrator or Governmental Authority is pending or, to the best knowledge of the
Credit Parties, threatened by or against any Credit Party or any of its
Subsidiaries or against any of their respective properties which (a) relates to
the Credit Documents or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby
or (b) is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect. Set forth on
Schedule 5.6 is a summary of material litigation matters pending as of the
Closing Date.

         5.7      No Default.

         No Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing.

         5.8      Taxes.

         Each of the Credit Parties and its Subsidiaries has filed, or caused to
be filed, all tax returns (federal, state, local and foreign) required to be
filed and paid (a) all amounts of taxes

                                       37

<PAGE>

shown thereon to be due (including interest and penalties) and (b) all other
taxes, fees, assessments and other governmental charges (including mortgage
recording taxes, documentary stamp taxes and intangibles taxes) owing by it,
except for such taxes (i) which are not yet delinquent or (ii) that are being
contested in good faith and by proper proceedings, and against which adequate
reserves are being maintained in accordance with GAAP. Neither any of the Credit
Parties nor any of its Subsidiaries are aware as of the Closing Date of any
proposed tax assessments against it or any of its Subsidiaries which could
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         5.9      ERISA

         Neither a Reportable Event nor an "accumulated funding deficiency"
(within the meaning of Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA) has
occurred during the five-year period prior to the date on which this
representation is made or deemed made with respect to any Plan, and each Plan
has complied in all material respects with the applicable provisions of ERISA
and the Code, except to the extent that any such occurrence or failure to comply
would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. No
termination of a Single Employer Plan has occurred resulting in any liability
that has remained underfunded, and no Lien in favor of the PBGC or a Plan has
arisen, during such five-year period which could reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect. The present value of all accrued benefits under each
Single Employer Plan (based on those assumptions used to fund such Plans) did
not, as of the last annual valuation date prior to the date on which this
representation is made or deemed made, exceed the value of the assets of such
Plan allocable to such accrued benefits by an amount which, as determined in
accordance with GAAP, could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect. Neither the Borrower nor any Commonly Controlled Entity is currently
subject to any liability for a complete or partial withdrawal from a
Multiemployer Plan which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect.

         5.10     Governmental Regulations, Etc.

         (a)      No part of the proceeds of the Loans hereunder will be used,
directly or indirectly, for the purpose of purchasing or carrying any "margin
stock" within the meaning of Regulation U, or for the purpose of purchasing or
carrying or trading in any securities. If requested by any Lender or the
Administrative Agent, the Borrower will furnish to the Administrative Agent and
each Lender a statement to the foregoing effect in conformity with the
requirements of FR Form U-1 referred to in said Regulation U. No Indebtedness
being reduced or retired out of the proceeds of the Loans hereunder was or will
be incurred for the purpose of purchasing or carrying any margin stock within
the meaning of Regulation U or any "margin security" within the meaning of
Regulation T. "Margin stock" within the meaning of Regulation U does not
constitute more than 25% of the value of the consolidated assets of the Borrower
and its Subsidiaries. Neither the execution and delivery hereof by the Borrower,
nor the performance by it of any of the transactions contemplated by this Credit
Agreement (including, without limitation, the direct or indirect use of the
proceeds of the Loans) will violate or result in a violation of the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or
regulations issued pursuant thereto, or Regulation T, U or X.

                                       38

<PAGE>

         (b)      None of the Credit Parties is (i) an "investment company"
registered or required to be registered under the Investment Company Act of
1940, as amended, and is not controlled by such a company, or (ii) a "holding
company", or a "subsidiary company" of a "holding company", or an "affiliate" of
a "holding company" or of a "subsidiary" of a "holding company", within the
meaning of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended.

         5.11     Subsidiaries.

         Set forth on Schedule 5.11 is a list of all the Subsidiaries of the
Credit Parties as of the Closing Date, including a list of the Material Domestic
Subsidiaries of the Borrower, the jurisdiction of their incorporation and the
direct or indirect ownership interest of the Borrower therein.

         5.12     Use of Proceeds.

         The Loans will be used solely (a) to refinance certain existing
Indebtedness, (b) to provide general working capital and (c) for other general
corporate purposes.

         5.13     Compliance with Laws; Contractual Obligations.

         Each Credit Party and each Subsidiary is in compliance with all
Requirements of Law, except to the extent that the failure to comply therewith
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect. None of the Credit Parties is in default under or with
respect to any of its contractual obligations in any respect which could
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         5.14     Accuracy and Completeness of Information.

         As of the Closing Date, to the best of the Borrower's knowledge, no
representation or warranty of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries contained
in this Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document or in any other document,
certificate or written statement furnished to the Lenders by or on behalf of the
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries contains any untrue statement of a material
fact or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements
contained in such agreements, documents, certificates and statements not
misleading in light of the circumstances in which the same were made.

         5.15     Environmental Matters.

         (a)      The Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries is in compliance in
all material respects with all Environmental Laws the non-compliance with which
could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         (b)      There has been no "release or threatened release of a
hazardous substance" (as defined by the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, 42 U.S.C. Section 9601 et
seq.) or any other release, emission or discharge into the environment of any
hazardous or toxic substance, pollutant or other materials from the

                                       39

<PAGE>

Borrower's or its Subsidiaries' property other than as permitted under
applicable Environmental Law and other than those which would not have a
Material Adverse Effect. Other than disposals (i) for which the Borrower has
been indemnified in full or (ii) which would not have a Material Adverse Effect,
all "hazardous waste" (as defined by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act,
42 U.S.C. Section 6901 et seq. (1976) and the regulations thereunder, 40 CFR
Part 261 ("RCRA")) generated at the Borrower's or any Subsidiaries' properties
have in the past been and shall continue to be disposed of at sites which
maintain valid permits under RCRA and any applicable state or local
Environmental Law.

         5.16     Solvency.

         The fair saleable value of the Credit Parties' assets taken as a whole,
measured on a going concern basis, exceeds all probable liabilities, including
those to be incurred pursuant to this Credit Agreement. None of the Credit
Parties (a) has unreasonably small capital in relation to the business in which
it is or proposes to be engaged or (b) has incurred, or believes that it will
incur after giving effect to the transactions contemplated by this Credit
Agreement, debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they become due.

         5.17     No Burdensome Restrictions.

         None of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any
agreement or instrument or subject to any other obligation or any charter or
corporate restriction or any provision of any applicable law, rule or regulation
which, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

         5.18     Material Contracts.

         Schedule 5.18 sets forth a true and correct and complete list of all
Material Contracts currently in effect as of the Closing Date. All of the
Material Contracts are in full force and effect and no material defaults
currently exist thereunder.

         5.19     Insurance.

         The Borrower and its Subsidiaries maintain insurance policies for
liability, casualty and business interruption on terms and in coverage amounts
comparable to the industry standard applicable to the assets and operations of
the Borrower and its Subsidiaries.

                                    SECTION 6
                              AFFIRMATIVE COVENANTS

         The Credit Parties covenant and agree that on the Closing Date, and so
long as this Credit Agreement is in effect and until the Commitments have been
terminated, no Loans remain outstanding and all amounts owing hereunder or under
any other Credit Document or in connection herewith or therewith have been paid
in full, the Credit Parties shall, and shall cause each Subsidiary to:

Credit Agreement or for the value, validity, effectiveness, genuineness,
enforceability or sufficiency of any of the Credit Documents or for any failure
of any Credit Party to perform its obligations hereunder or thereunder. The
Administrative Agent shall not be under any obligation to any Lender to
ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or performance by any Credit Party
of any of the agreements contained in, or conditions of, this Credit Agreement,

message, statement, order or other document or conversation believed by it in
good faith to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by
the proper Person or Persons and upon advice and statements of legal counsel
(including, without limitation, counsel to the Credit Parties), independent
accountants and other experts selected by the Administrative Agent. The

Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall be fully justified in
failing or refusing to take any action under this Credit Agreement unless it
shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the Required Lenders as it
deems appropriate or it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the
Lenders against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by
reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. The Administrative Agent
shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting,
under any of the Credit Documents in accordance with a request of the Required
Lenders or all of the Lenders, as may be required under this Credit Agreement,
and such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall
be binding upon all the Lenders and all future holders of the Notes.

         9.5      Notice of Default.

         The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or
notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default hereunder unless the
Administrative Agent has received notice from a Lender or the Borrower referring
to this Credit Agreement, describing such Default or Event of Default and
stating that such notice is a "notice of default". In the event that the
Administrative Agent receives such a notice, the Administrative Agent shall give
prompt notice thereof to the Lenders. The Administrative Agent shall take such
action with respect to such Default or Event of Default as shall be reasonably
directed by the Required Lenders; provided, however, that unless and until the
Administrative Agent shall have received such directions, the Administrative
Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from
taking such action, with respect to such Default or Event of Default as it shall
deem advisable in the best interests of the Lenders except to the extent that
this Credit Agreement expressly requires that such action be taken, or not
taken, only with the consent or upon the authorization of the Required Lenders,
or all of the Lenders, as the case may be.

         9.6      Non-Reliance on Administrative Agent and Other Lenders.

         Each Lender expressly acknowledges that neither the Administrative
Agent nor any of its officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact
or affiliates has made any representation or warranty to it and that no act by
the Administrative Agent hereinafter taken, including any review of the affairs
of the Credit Parties, shall be deemed to constitute any representation or
warranty by the Administrative Agent to any Lender. Each Lender represents to
the Administrative Agent that it has, independently and without reliance upon
the Administrative Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and
information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of and
investigation into the business, operations, property, financial and other
condition and creditworthiness of the Credit Parties and made its own decision
to make its Loans hereunder and enter into this Credit Agreement. Each Lender
also represents that it will, independently and without reliance upon the
Administrative Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and
information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own
credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under
this Credit Agreement, and to make such investigation as it deems necessary to
inform itself as to the business, operations, property, financial and other
condition and creditworthiness of the Credit Parties. Except for notices,
reports and other documents expressly required to be furnished to the Lenders by
the Administrative Agent hereunder, the Administrative Agent shall not have any
duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other
information concerning the business, operations, property, condition (financial
or otherwise), prospects or creditworthiness of the Credit Parties which may
come into the possession of the Administrative Agent or any of its officers,
directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or affiliates.

         9.7      Indemnification.

         The Lenders agree to indemnify the Administrative Agent in its capacity
hereunder (to the extent not reimbursed by the Credit Parties and without
limiting the obligation of the Credit Parties to do so), ratably according to
their respective Commitment Percentages in effect on the

                                       54

<PAGE>

date on which indemnification is sought under this Section, from and against any
and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions,
judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind whatsoever which
may at any time (including, without limitation, at any time following the
payment of the Notes) be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the
Administrative Agent in any way relating to or arising out of any Credit
Document or any documents contemplated by or referred to herein or therein or
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or any action taken or omitted
by the Administrative Agent under or in connection with any of the foregoing;
provided, however, that no Lender shall be liable for the payment of any portion
of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions,
judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements to the extent resulting from
the Administrative Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct, as determined
by a court of competent jurisdiction pursuant to a final non-appealable
judgment. The agreements in this Section 9.7 shall survive the termination of
this Credit Agreement and payment of the Notes and all other amounts payable
hereunder.

         9.8      Administrative Agent in Its Individual Capacity.

         The Administrative Agent and its affiliates may make loans to, accept
deposits from and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower as
though the Administrative Agent were not the Administrative Agent hereunder.
With respect to its Loans made or renewed by it and any Note issued to it, the
Administrative Agent shall have the same rights and powers under this Credit
Agreement as any Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the
Administrative Agent, and the terms "Lender" and "Lenders" shall include the
Administrative Agent in its individual capacity.

         9.9      Successor Administrative Agent.

         The Administrative Agent may resign as Administrative Agent upon 30
days' prior notice to the Borrower and the Lenders. If the Administrative Agent
shall resign as Administrative Agent under this Credit Agreement and the other
Credit Documents, then the Required Lenders shall appoint from among the Lenders
a successor agent for the Lenders, which successor agent shall be approved by
the Borrower, whereupon such successor agent shall succeed to the rights, powers
and duties of the Administrative Agent, and the term "Administrative Agent"
shall mean such successor agent effective upon such appointment and approval,
and the former Administrative Agent's rights, powers and duties as
Administrative Agent shall be terminated, without any other or further act or
deed on the part of such former Administrative Agent or any of the parties to
this Credit Agreement or any holders of the Notes. After any retiring
Administrative Agent's resignation as Administrative Agent, the provisions of
this Section 9.9 shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted
to be taken by it while it was Administrative Agent under this Credit Agreement.

                                   SECTION 10
                                  MISCELLANEOUS

         10.1     Amendments, Waivers and Release of Collateral.

         Neither this Credit Agreement, nor any of the other Credit Documents,
nor any terms hereof or thereof may be amended, supplemented, waived or modified
except in accordance with the provisions of this Section. The Required Lenders
may, or, with the written consent of the Required Lenders, the Administrative
Agent may, from time to time, (a) enter into with the Borrower written
amendments, supplements or modifications hereto and to the other Credit
Documents for the purpose of adding any provisions to this Credit Agreement or
the other Credit Documents or changing in any manner the rights of the Lenders
or of the Borrower hereunder or thereunder or (b) waive, on such terms and
conditions as the Required Lenders may specify in such instrument, any of the
requirements of this Credit Agreement or the other Credit Documents or any
Default or Event of Default and its consequences; provided, however, that no
such waiver and no such amendment, waiver, supplement, modification or release
shall:

                  (i)      reduce the amount or extend the scheduled date of
         maturity of any Loan or Note or any installment thereon, or reduce the
         stated rate of any interest or fee payable hereunder (except in
         connection with a waiver of interest at the increased post-default
         rate) or extend the scheduled date of any payment thereof or increase
         the amount or extend the expiration date of any Lender's Commitment, in
         each case without the written consent of each Lender directly affected
         thereby; or

                  (ii)     amend, modify or waive any provision of this Section
         10.1 or reduce the percentage specified in the definition of Required
         Lenders, without the written consent of all the Lenders; or

                  (iii)    amend, modify or waive any provision of Section 9
         without the written consent of the then Administrative Agent; or

                  (iv)     release all or substantially all of the Guarantors
         from their obligations under the Guaranty, without the written consent
         of all of the Lenders; or

                  (v)      amend, modify or waive any provision of the Credit
         Documents requiring consent, approval or request of the Required
         Lenders or all Lenders, without the written consent of all the Lenders;

provided, further, that no amendment, waiver or consent affecting the rights or
duties of the Administrative Agent under any Credit Document shall in any event
be effective, unless in writing and signed by the Administrative Agent in
addition to the Lenders required hereinabove to take such action.

         Any such waiver, any such amendment, supplement or modification and any
such release shall apply equally to each of the Lenders and shall be binding
upon the Borrower, the other Credit Parties, the Lenders, the Administrative
Agent and all future holders of the Notes. In the

                                       56

<PAGE>

case of any waiver, the Borrower, the other Credit Parties, the Lenders and the
Administrative Agent shall be restored to their former position and rights
hereunder and under the outstanding Loans and Notes and other Credit Documents,
subject to any limitations contained in such waiver, and any Default or Event of
Default permanently waived shall be deemed to be cured and not continuing; but
no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or Event of
Default, or impair any right consequent thereon.

         Notwithstanding any of the foregoing to the contrary, the consent of
the Borrower shall not be required for any amendment, modification or waiver of
the provisions of Section 9 (other than the provisions of Section 9.9);
provided, however, that the Administrative Agent will provide written notice to
the Borrower of any such amendment, modification or waiver. In addition, the
Borrower and the Lenders hereby authorize the Administrative Agent to modify
this Credit Agreement by unilaterally amending or supplementing Schedule 2.1(a)
from time to time in the manner requested by the Borrower, the Administrative
Agent or any Lender in order to reflect any assignments or transfers of the
Loans as provided for hereunder; provided further, however, that the
Administrative Agent shall promptly deliver a copy of any such modification to
the Borrower and each Lender.

         Notwithstanding the fact that the consent of all the Lenders is
required in certain circumstances as set forth above, (x) each Lender is
entitled to vote as such Lender sees fit on any bankruptcy reorganization plan
that affects the Loans, and each Lender acknowledges that the provisions of
Section 1126(c) of the Bankruptcy Code supersedes the unanimous consent
provisions set forth herein and (y) the Required Lenders may consent to allow a
Credit Party to use cash collateral in the context of a bankruptcy or insolvency
proceeding.

         10.2     Notices.

         All notices, requests and demands to or upon the respective parties
hereto to be effective shall be in writing (including by telecopy), and, unless

facsimile device) to the number set out herein, (c) the day following the day on

         No failure to exercise and no delay in exercising, on the part of the
Administrative Agent or any Lender, any right, remedy, power or privilege
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial
exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder preclude any other

privilege. The rights, remedies, powers and privileges herein provided are
cumulative and not exclusive of any rights, remedies, powers and privileges
provided by law.

         10.4     Survival of Representations and Warranties.

warranties shall terminate on the date upon which the Commitments have been
terminated and all Credit Party Obligations have been paid in full.

         10.5     Payment of Expenses and Taxes.

         The Borrower agrees (a) to pay or reimburse the Administrative Agent
and the Arranger for all their reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses
incurred in connection with the development, preparation, negotiation, printing
and execution of, and any amendment, supplement or modification to, this Credit
Agreement and the other Credit Documents and any other documents prepared in
connection herewith or therewith, and the consummation and administration of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, together with the reasonable fees
and disbursements of counsel to the Administrative Agent and the Arranger, (b)
to pay or reimburse each Lender and the Administrative Agent for all its costs
and expenses incurred in connection with the enforcement or preservation of any
rights under this Credit Agreement and the other Credit Documents, including,
without limitation, the reasonable out-of-pocket fees and disbursements of
counsel to the Administrative Agent and to the Lenders, and (c) on demand, to
pay, indemnify, and hold each Lender and the Administrative Agent harmless from,
any and all recording and filing fees and any and all liabilities with respect
to, or resulting from any delay in paying, stamp, excise and other similar
taxes, if any, which may be payable or determined to be payable in connection
with the execution and delivery of, or consummation or administration of any of
the transactions contemplated by, or any amendment, supplement or modification
of, or any waiver or consent under or in respect of, the Credit Documents and
any such other documents, and (d) to pay, indemnify, and hold each Lender and
the Administrative Agent and their Affiliates harmless from and against, any and
all other liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions,
judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature
whatsoever with respect to the execution, delivery, enforcement, performance and
administration of the Credit Documents and any such other documents and the use,
or proposed use, of proceeds of the Loans (all of the foregoing, collectively,
the "indemnified liabilities"); provided, however, that the Borrower shall not
have any obligation hereunder to the Administrative Agent or any Lender with
respect to indemnified liabilities arising from the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of the Administrative Agent or any such Lender, as determined by a
court of competent jurisdiction pursuant to a final non-appealable judgment. The
agreements in this Section 10.5 shall survive repayment of the Loans, Notes and
all other Credit Party Obligations.

         10.6     Successors and Assigns; Participations; Purchasing Lenders.

         (a)      This Credit Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the Borrower, the Lenders, the Administrative Agent, all future
holders of the Notes and their respective successors and assigns, except that
the Borrower may not assign or transfer any of its rights or obligations under
this Credit Agreement or the other Credit Documents without the prior written
consent of each Lender.

         (b)      Any Lender may, in the ordinary course of its commercial
banking business and in accordance with applicable law, at any time sell to one
or more banks or other entities ("Participants") participating interests in any
Loan owing to such Lender, any Note held by such Lender, any Commitment of such
Lender, or any other interest of such Lender hereunder. In the event of any such
sale by a Lender of participating interests to a Participant, such Lender's
obligations under this Credit Agreement to the other parties to this Credit
Agreement shall

                                       59

<PAGE>

remain unchanged, such Lender shall remain solely responsible for the
performance thereof, such Lender shall remain the holder of any such Note for
all purposes under this Credit Agreement, and the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender
in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Credit
Agreement. No Lender shall transfer or grant any participation under which the
Participant shall have rights to approve any amendment to or waiver of this
Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document except to the extent such
amendment or waiver would (i) extend the scheduled maturity of any Loan or Note
or any installment thereon in which such Participant is participating, or reduce
the stated rate or extend the time of payment of interest or fees thereon
(except in connection with a waiver of interest at the increased post-default
rate) or reduce the principal amount thereof, or increase the amount of the
Participant's participation over the amount thereof then in effect (it being
understood that a waiver of any Default or Event of Default shall not constitute
a change in the terms of such participation, and that an increase in any
Commitment or Loan shall be permitted without consent of any Participant if the
Participant's participation is not increased as a result thereof), (ii) release
all or substantially all of the Guarantors from their obligations under the
Guaranty, or (iii) consent to the assignment or transfer by the Borrower of any
of its rights and obligations under this Credit Agreement. In the case of any
such participation, the Participant shall not have any rights under this Credit
Agreement or any of the other Credit Documents (the Participant's rights against
such Lender in respect of such participation to be those set forth in the
agreement executed by such Lender in favor of the Participant relating thereto)
and all amounts payable by the Borrower hereunder shall be determined as if such
Lender had not sold such participation; provided that each Participant shall be
entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.10, 3.11, 3.12 and 10.5 with respect to
its participation in the Commitments and the Loans outstanding from time to
time; provided further, that no Participant shall be entitled to receive any
greater amount pursuant to such Sections than the transferor Lender would have
been entitled to receive in respect of the amount of the participation
transferred by such transferor Lender to such Participant had no such transfer
occurred.

         (c)      Any Lender may, in the ordinary course of its commercial
banking business and in accordance with applicable law, at any time, sell or
assign to any Lender or any Affiliate or Related Fund thereof and, with the
consent of the Administrative Agent and, so long as no Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing, the Borrower (in each case, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld), to one or more additional banks or financial
institutions or entities ("Purchasing Lenders"), all or any part of its rights
and obligations under this Credit Agreement and the Notes in minimum amounts of
$5,000,000 with respect to its Commitment and Loans (or, if less, the entire
amount of such Lender's obligations), pursuant to a Commitment Transfer
Supplement, executed by such Purchasing Lender and such transferor Lender (and,
to the extent required above, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower), and
delivered to the Administrative Agent for its acceptance and recording in the
Register; provided, however, that any sale or assignment to an existing Lender
shall not require the consent of the Administrative Agent or the Borrower nor
shall any such sale or assignment be subject to the minimum assignment amounts
specified herein. Upon such execution, delivery, acceptance and recording, from
and after the Transfer Effective Date specified in such Commitment Transfer
Supplement, (x) the Purchasing Lender thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to
the extent provided in such Commitment Transfer Supplement, have the rights and
obligations of a Lender hereunder with a Commitment

                                       60

<PAGE>

as set forth therein, and (y) the transferor Lender thereunder shall, to the
extent provided in such Commitment Transfer Supplement, be released from its
obligations under this Credit Agreement (and, in the case of a Commitment
Transfer Supplement covering all or the remaining portion of a transferor
Lender's rights and obligations under this Credit Agreement, such transferor
Lender shall cease to be a party hereto; provided, however, that such Lender
shall still be entitled to any indemnification rights hereunder). Such
Commitment Transfer Supplement shall be deemed to amend this Credit Agreement to
the extent, and only to the extent, necessary to reflect the addition of such
Purchasing Lender and the resulting adjustment of Commitment Percentages arising
from the purchase by such Purchasing Lender of all or a portion of the rights
and obligations of such transferor Lender under this Credit Agreement and the
Notes. On or prior to the Transfer Effective Date specified in such Commitment
Transfer Supplement, the Borrower shall execute and deliver to the
Administrative Agent in exchange for the Notes delivered to the Administrative
Agent pursuant to such Commitment Transfer Supplement new Notes to the order of
such Purchasing Lender in an amount equal to the Commitment assumed by it
pursuant to such Commitment Transfer Supplement and, unless the transferor
Lender has not retained a Commitment hereunder, new Notes to the order of the
transferor Lender in an amount equal to the Commitment retained by it hereunder.
Such new Notes shall be dated the Closing Date and shall otherwise be in the
form of the Notes replaced thereby. The Notes surrendered by the transferor
Lender shall be returned by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower marked
"canceled".

         (d)      The Administrative Agent shall maintain at its address
referred to in Section 10.2 a copy of each Commitment Transfer Supplement
delivered to it and a register (the "Register") for the recordation of the names
and addresses of the Lenders and the Commitment of, and principal amount of the
Loans owing to, each Lender from time to time. The entries in the Register shall
be conclusive, in the absence of manifest error, and the Borrower, the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is
recorded in the Register as the owner of the Loan recorded therein for all
purposes of this Credit Agreement. The Register shall be available for
inspection by the Borrower or any Lender at any reasonable time and from time to
time upon reasonable prior notice.

         (e)      Upon its receipt of a duly executed Commitment Transfer
Supplement, together with payment to the Administrative Agent by the transferor
Lender or the Purchasing Lender, as agreed between them, of a registration and
processing fee of $3,500.00 for each Purchasing Lender listed in such Commitment
Transfer Supplement and the Notes subject to such Commitment Transfer
Supplement, the Administrative Agent shall (i) accept such Commitment Transfer
Supplement, (ii) record the information contained therein in the Register and
(iii) give prompt notice of such acceptance and recordation to the Lenders and
the Borrower.

         (f)      The Borrower authorizes each Lender to disclose to any
Participant or Purchasing Lender (each, a "Transferee") and any prospective
Transferee any and all financial information in such Lender's possession
concerning the Borrower and its Affiliates which has been delivered to such
Lender by or on behalf of the Borrower pursuant to this Credit Agreement or
which has been delivered to such Lender by or on behalf of the Borrower in
connection with such Lender's credit evaluation of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries prior to becoming a party to this Credit Agreement, in each case
subject to Section 10.16.

                                       61

<PAGE>

         (g)      At the time of each assignment pursuant to this Section 10.6
to a Person which is not already a Lender hereunder and which is not a United
States person (as such term is defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) for
Federal income tax purposes, the respective assignee Lender shall provide to the
Borrower and the Administrative Agent the appropriate Internal Revenue Service
Forms (and, if applicable, a 3.13 Certificate) described in Section 3.13.

         (h)      Nothing herein shall prohibit any Lender from pledging or
assigning any of its rights under this Credit Agreement (including, without
limitation, any right to payment of principal and interest under any Note) to
any Federal Reserve Bank in accordance with applicable laws.

         10.7     Adjustments; Set-off.

         (a)      Each Lender agrees that if any Lender (a "benefited Lender")
shall at any time receive any payment of all or part of its Loans, or interest
thereon, or receive any collateral in respect thereof (whether voluntarily or
involuntarily, by set-off, pursuant to events or proceedings of the nature
referred to in Section 8.1(e), or otherwise) in a greater proportion than any
such payment to or collateral received by any other Lender, if any, in respect
of such other Lender's Loans, or interest thereon, such benefited Lender shall
purchase for cash from the other Lenders a participating interest in such
portion of each such other Lender's Loan, or shall provide such other Lenders
with the benefits of any such collateral, or the proceeds thereof, as shall be
necessary to cause such benefited Lender to share the excess payment or benefits
of such collateral or proceeds ratably with each of the Lenders; provided,
however, that if all or any portion of such excess payment or benefits is
thereafter recovered from such benefited Lender, such purchase shall be
rescinded, and the purchase price and benefits returned, to the extent of such
recovery, but without interest. The Borrower agrees that each Lender so
purchasing a portion of another Lender's Loans may exercise all rights of
payment (including, without limitation, rights of set-off) with respect to such
portion as fully as if such Lender were the direct holder of such portion.

         (b)      In addition to any rights and remedies of the Lenders provided
by law (including, without limitation, other rights of set-off), each Lender
shall have the right, without prior notice to any Credit Party, any such notice
being expressly waived by the Credit Parties to the extent permitted by
applicable law, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default, to setoff and
appropriate and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand,
provisional or final), in any currency, and any other credits, indebtedness or
claims, in any currency, in each case whether direct or indirect, absolute or
contingent, matured or unmatured, at any time held or owing by such Lender or
any branch or agency thereof to or for the credit or the account of any Credit
Party, or any part thereof in such amounts as such Lender may elect, against and
on account of the obligations and liabilities of the Borrower and the other
Credit Parties to such Lender hereunder and claims of every nature and
description of such Lender against the Borrower and the other Credit Parties, in
any currency, whether arising hereunder, under the Notes or under any documents
contemplated by or referred to herein or therein, as such Lender may elect,
whether or not such Lender has made any demand for payment and although such
obligations, liabilities and claims may be contingent or unmatured. The
aforesaid right of set-off

                                       62

<PAGE>

may be exercised by such Lender against any Credit Party or against any trustee
in bankruptcy, debtor in possession, assignee for the benefit of creditors,
receiver or execution, judgment or attachment creditor of any such Credit Party,
or against anyone else claiming through or against any such Credit Party or any
such trustee in bankruptcy, debtor in possession, assignee for the benefit of
creditors, receiver, or execution, judgment or attachment creditor,
notwithstanding the fact that such right of set-off shall not have been
exercised by such Lender prior to the occurrence of any Event of Default. Each
Lender agrees promptly to notify the applicable Credit Party and the
Administrative Agent after any such set-off and application made by such Lender;
provided, however, that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the
validity of such set-off and application.

         10.13    Governing Law.

obligations of the parties under this Credit Agreement and the other Credit
Documents shall be governed by, and construed and interpreted in accordance

the other Credit Parties irrevocably agrees that all service of process in any
such proceedings in any such court may be effected by mailing a copy thereof by
registered or certified mail (or any substantially similar form of mail),

objection to the laying of venue based on the grounds of forum non conveniens
which it may now or hereafter have to the bringing of any such action or
proceeding in any such jurisdiction. Nothing herein shall affect the right to

         10.15    Arbitration.

         (a)      Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 10.14 to the
contrary, upon demand of any party hereto, whether made before or within three
(3) months after institution of any judicial proceeding, any dispute, claim or
controversy arising out of, connected with or relating to this Credit Agreement
and other Credit Documents ("Disputes") between or among parties to this Credit
Agreement shall be resolved by binding arbitration as provided herein.
Institution of a judicial proceeding by a party does not waive the right of that
party to demand arbitration hereunder. Disputes may include, without limitation,
tort claims, counterclaims, disputes as to whether a matter is subject to
arbitration, claims brought as class actions, claims arising from Credit
Documents executed in the future, or claims arising out of or connected with the
transaction reflected by this Credit Agreement.

         Arbitration shall be conducted under and governed by the Commercial
Arbitration Rules (the "Arbitration Rules") of the American Arbitration
Association (the "AAA") and Title 9 of the U.S. Code. All arbitration hearings
shall be conducted in New York, New York. A hearing shall begin within 90 days
of demand for arbitration and all hearings shall be concluded within 120

                                       64

<PAGE>

days of demand for arbitration. These time limitations may not be extended
unless a party shows cause for extension and then no more than a total extension
of 60 days. The expedited procedures set forth in Rule 51 et seq. of the
Arbitration Rules shall be applicable to claims of less than $1,000,000. All
applicable statutes of limitation shall apply to any Dispute. A judgment upon

licensed attorneys selected from the Commercial Financial Dispute Arbitration
Panel of the AAA. The parties hereto do not waive applicable Federal or state
substantive law except as provided herein.

         (b)      Notwithstanding the preceding binding arbitration provisions,
the Administrative Agent, the Lenders, the Borrower and the other Credit Parties
agree to preserve, without diminution, certain remedies that the Administrative
Agent on behalf of the Lenders may employ or exercise freely, independently or
in connection with an arbitration proceeding or after an arbitration action is
brought. The Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lenders shall have the right
to proceed in any court of proper jurisdiction or by self-help to exercise or
prosecute the following remedies, as applicable (i) obtaining provisional or
ancillary remedies including injunctive relief, sequestration, garnishment,
attachment, appointment of receiver and filing an involuntary bankruptcy
proceeding; and (ii) when applicable, a judgment by confession of judgment.
Preservation of these remedies does not limit the power of an arbitrator to
grant similar remedies that may be requested by a party in a Dispute.

         (c)      The parties hereto agree that they shall not have a remedy of
punitive or exemplary damages against the other in any Dispute and hereby waive
any right or claim to punitive or exemplary damages they have now or which may
arise in the future in connection with any Dispute whether the Dispute is
resolved by arbitration or judicially.

         (d)      By execution and delivery of this Credit Agreement, each of
the parties hereto accepts, for itself and in connection with its properties,
generally and unconditionally, the non-exclusive jurisdiction relating to any
arbitration proceedings conducted under the Arbitration Rules in New York, New
York and irrevocably agrees to be bound by any final judgment rendered thereby
in connection with this Credit Agreement from which no appeal has been taken or
is available.

         The Administrative Agent and each of the Lenders agrees that it shall
not disclose without the prior consent of the Borrower (other than to its
employees, affiliates, auditors or counsel or to another Lender) any information
with respect to the Borrower and its Subsidiaries which is furnished pursuant to
this Credit Agreement, any other Credit Document or any documents contemplated
by or referred to herein or therein and which is designated by the Borrower to
the Lenders in writing as confidential or as to which it is otherwise reasonably
clear such information is not public, except that any Lender may disclose any
such information (a) as has become generally available to the public other than
by a breach of this Section 10.16, (b) as may be required in any report,
statement or testimony submitted to any municipal, state or federal regulatory
body having or claiming to have jurisdiction over such Lender or to the Federal
Reserve Board or the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or the OCC or the
NAIC or

                                       65

<PAGE>

similar organizations (whether in the United States or elsewhere) or their
successors, (c) as may be required in response to any summons or subpoena or any
law, order, regulation or ruling applicable to such Lender, (d) to any
prospective Participant or assignee in connection with any contemplated transfer
pursuant to Section 10.6; provided that such prospective transferee shall have
been made aware of this Section 10.16 and has agreed to be bound thereby or (e)
to Gold Sheets and other similar bank trade publications, such information to
consist of deal terms and other information regarding the credit facilities
evidenced by this Credit Agreement customarily found in such publications.

and delivery of each Credit Document;

         (b)      neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender has any
fiduciary relationship with or duty to the Borrower or any other Credit Party
arising out of or in connection with this Credit Agreement and the relationship
between Administrative Agent and Lenders, on one hand, and the Borrower and the
other Credit Parties, on the other hand, in connection herewith is solely that
of debtor and creditor; and

         (c)      no joint venture exists among the Lenders or among the
Borrower or the other Credit Parties and the Lenders.

         10.18    Waivers of Jury Trial.

         THE BORROWER, THE OTHER CREDIT PARTIES, THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND
THE LENDERS HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVE, TO THE EXTENT

                                   SECTION 11
                                    GUARANTY

         11.1     The Guaranty.

         In order to induce the Lenders to enter into this Credit Agreement and
to extend credit hereunder and in recognition of the direct benefits to be
received by the Guarantors from the Extensions of Credit hereunder, each of the
Guarantors hereby agrees with the Administrative Agent and the Lenders as
follows: the Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably jointly and
severally guarantees as primary obligor and not merely as surety the full and
prompt payment when due, whether upon maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of
any and all Credit Party Obligations. If any or all of the Credit Party
Obligations becomes due and payable

                                       66

<PAGE>

hereunder, each Guarantor unconditionally promises to pay such Credit Party
Obligations to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, or order, or demand,
together with any and all reasonable expenses which may be incurred by the
Administrative Agent or the Lenders in collecting any of the Credit Party
Obligations.

         Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained herein or in
any other of the Credit Documents, to the extent the obligations of a Guarantor
shall be adjudicated to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason (including,
without limitation, because of any applicable state or federal law relating to
fraudulent conveyances or transfers) then the obligations of each such Guarantor
hereunder shall be limited to the maximum amount that is permissible under
applicable law (whether federal or state and including, without limitation, the
Bankruptcy Code).

         11.2     Bankruptcy.

         Additionally, each of the Guarantors unconditionally and irrevocably
guarantees jointly and severally the payment of any and all Credit Party
Obligations of the Borrower to the Lenders whether or not due or payable by the
Borrower upon the occurrence of any of the events specified in Section 8.1(e),
and unconditionally promises to pay such Credit Party Obligations to the
Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders, or order, on demand, in
lawful money of the United States. Each of the Guarantors further agrees that to
the extent that the Borrower or a Guarantor shall make a payment or a transfer
of an interest in any property to the Administrative Agent or any Lender, which
payment or transfer or any part thereof is subsequently invalidated, declared to
be fraudulent or preferential, or otherwise is avoided, and/or required to be
repaid to the Borrower or a Guarantor, the estate of the Borrower or a
Guarantor, a trustee, receiver or any other party under any bankruptcy law,
state or federal law, common law or equitable cause, then to the extent of such
avoidance or repayment, the obligation or part thereof intended to be satisfied
shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as if said payment had
not been made.

         11.3     Nature of Liability.

         The liability of each Guarantor hereunder is exclusive and independent
of any security for or other guaranty of the Credit Party Obligations of the
Borrower whether executed by any such Guarantor, any other guarantor or by any
other party, and no Guarantor's liability hereunder shall be affected or
impaired by (a) any direction as to application of payment by the Borrower or by
any other party, or (b) any other continuing or other guaranty, undertaking or
maximum liability of a guarantor or of any other party as to the Credit Party
Obligations of the Borrower, or (c) any payment on or in reduction of any such
other guaranty or undertaking, or (d) any dissolution, termination or increase,
decrease or change in personnel by the Borrower, or (e) any payment made to the
Administrative Agent or the Lenders on the Credit Party Obligations which the
Administrative Agent or such Lenders repay the Borrower pursuant to court order
in any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, moratorium or other debtor
relief proceeding, and each of the Guarantors waives any right to the deferral
or modification of its obligations hereunder by reason of any such proceeding.

                                       67

<PAGE>

         11.4     Independent Obligation.

         The obligations of each Guarantor hereunder are independent of the
obligations of any other guarantor or the Borrower, and a separate action or
actions may be brought and prosecuted against each Guarantor whether or not
action is brought against any other guarantor or the Borrower and whether or not
any other Guarantor or the Borrower is joined in any such action or actions.

         11.5     Authorization.

         Each of the Guarantors authorizes the Administrative Agent and each
Lender without notice or demand (except as shall be required by applicable
statute and cannot be waived), and without affecting or impairing its liability
hereunder, from time to time to (a) renew, compromise, extend, increase,
accelerate or otherwise change the time for payment of, or otherwise change the
terms of the Credit Party Obligations or any part thereof in accordance with
this Credit Agreement, including any increase or decrease of the rate of
interest thereon, (b) take and hold security from any guarantor or any other
party for the payment of this Guaranty or the Credit Party Obligations and
exchange, enforce waive and release any such security, (c) apply such security
and direct the order or manner of sale thereof as the Administrative Agent and
the Lenders in their discretion may determine and (d) release or substitute any
one or more endorsers, guarantors, the Borrower or other obligors.

         11.6     Reliance.

         It is not necessary for the Administrative Agent or the Lenders to
inquire into the capacity or powers of the Borrower or the officers, directors,
members, partners or agents acting or purporting to act on its behalf, and any
indebtedness made or created in reliance upon the professed exercise of such
powers shall be guaranteed hereunder.

         11.7     Waiver.

         (a)      Each of the Guarantors waives any right (except as shall be
required by applicable statute and cannot be waived) to require the
Administrative Agent or any Lender to (i) proceed against the Borrower, any
other guarantor or any other party, (ii) proceed against or exhaust any security
held from the Borrower, any other guarantor or any other party, or (iii) pursue
any other remedy in the Administrative Agent's or any Lender's power whatsoever.
Each of the Guarantors waives any defense based on or arising out of any defense
of the Borrower, any other guarantor or any other party other than payment in
full of the Credit Party Obligations, including without limitation any defense
based on or arising out of the disability of the Borrower, any other guarantor
or any other party, or the unenforceability of the Credit Party Obligations or
any part thereof from any cause, or the cessation from any cause of the
liability of the Borrower other than payment in full of the Credit Party
Obligations. The Administrative Agent or any of the Lenders may, at their
election, foreclose on any security held by the Administrative Agent or a Lender
by one or more judicial or nonjudicial sales, whether or not every aspect of any
such sale is commercially reasonable (to the extent such sale is permitted by
applicable law), or exercise any other right or remedy the Administrative Agent
and any Lender may have against the

                                       68

<PAGE>

Borrower or any other party, or any security, without affecting or impairing in
any way the liability of any Guarantor hereunder except to the extent the Credit
Party Obligations have been paid in full. Each of the Guarantors waives any
defense arising out of any such election by the Administrative Agent and each of
the Lenders, even though such election operates to impair or extinguish any
right of reimbursement or subrogation or other right or remedy of the Guarantors
against the Borrower or any other party or any security.

         (b)      Each of the Guarantors waives all presentments, demands for
performance, protests and notices, including without limitation notices of
nonperformance, notice of protest, notices of dishonor, notices of acceptance of
this Guaranty, and notices of the existence, creation or incurring of new or
additional Credit Party Obligations. Each Guarantor assumes all responsibility
for being and keeping itself informed of the Borrower's financial condition and
assets, and of all other circumstances bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of
the Credit Party Obligations and the nature, scope and extent of the risks which
such Guarantor assumes and incurs hereunder, and agrees that neither the
Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall have any duty to advise such Guarantor
of information known to it regarding such circumstances or risks.

         (c)      Each of the Guarantors hereby agrees it will not exercise any
rights of subrogation which it may at any time otherwise have as a result of
this Guaranty (whether contractual, under Section 509 of the U.S. Bankruptcy
Code, or otherwise) to the claims of the Lenders against the Borrower or any
other guarantor of the Credit Party Obligations of the Borrower owing to the
Lenders (collectively, the "Other Parties") and all contractual, statutory or
common law rights of reimbursement, contribution or indemnity from any Other
Party which it may at any time otherwise have as a result of this Guaranty until
such time as the Credit Party Obligations shall have been paid in full and the
Commitments have been terminated. Each of the Guarantors hereby further agrees
not to exercise any right to enforce any other remedy which the Administrative
Agent and the Lenders now have or may hereafter have against any Other Party,
any endorser or any other guarantor of all or any part of the Credit Party
Obligations of the Borrower and any benefit of, and any right to participate in,
any security or collateral given to or for the benefit of the Lenders to secure
payment of the Credit Party Obligations of the Borrower until such time as the
Credit Party Obligations shall have been paid in full and the Commitments have
been terminated.

         11.8     Limitation on Enforcement.

         The Lenders agree that this Guaranty may be enforced only by the action
of the Administrative Agent acting upon the instructions of the Required Lenders
and that no Lender shall have any right individually to seek to enforce or to
enforce this Guaranty, it being understood and agreed that such rights and
remedies may be exercised by the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the
Lenders under the terms of this Credit Agreement. The Lenders further agree that
this Guaranty may not be enforced against any director, officer, employee or
stockholder of the Guarantors.

                                       69

<PAGE>

         11.9     Confirmation of Payment.

         The Administrative Agent and the Lenders will, upon request after
payment of the Credit Party Obligations which are the subject of this Guaranty
and termination of the Commitments relating thereto, confirm to the Borrower,
the Guarantors or any other Person that the Credit Party Obligations have been
paid in full and the Commitments relating thereto terminated, subject to the
provisions of Section 11.2.

provided therein. In the event this Note is not paid when due at any stated or

interest, all costs of collection, including reasonable attorneys' fees.

                             MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT

ARGENTINA IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IN FIRST QUARTER OF 2002

In 2002, Borrower adopted FASB Statement No. 142 "Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets" ("FAS No. 142") which establishes a new method of testing goodwill and
other intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment. Pursuant to FAS
No. 142, Borrower will record a $43.3 million after-tax impairment charge for
Argentina in the first quarter of 2002. This charge was publicly announced on
March 19, 2002.

                               MATERIAL LITIGATION

EEOC v. Dial (U.S. District Court, Northern District of Illinois). The EEOC
alleges that Dial engaged in a pattern and practice of discrimination against a
class of female employees by subjecting them to sexual or sex-based harassment
and failing to take prompt remedial action after these employees complained
about the alleged harassment. The EEOC is seeking to enjoin Dial from this
alleged harassment, to require Dial to train its managerial employees regarding
the requirements of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and to recover
unspecified compensatory and punitive damages. Dial has denied the EEOC's
allegations. After discovery was completed, Dial filed a dispositive motion,
which was granted in part and denied in part by the Court in an opinion issued
in the third quarter of 2001. The Court granted Dial's motion to dismiss the
claims of thirteen individuals and denied its motion with respect to the
remaining individuals. Dial petitioned the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals to
review the U.S. District Court's ruling on Dial's summary judgment motion but
the Seventh Circuit denied Dial's petition for an interlocutory appeal. A trial
date has not been set.

SEC Informal Inquiry. In September 2000, the SEC sent a letter to Dial stating
that it had initiated an informal inquiry regarding the disclosure of Dial's
sales practices and, in particular, "trade loading" and requesting that Dial
produce related documents and information. Dial produced the requested documents
and information to the SEC in November 2000 and did not hear back from the SEC
until January 2002. In January 2002, the SEC requested that Dial's former Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer provide testimony on these issues.
It is anticipated that their testimony will be taken in April of 2002. In
February 2002, the SEC requested that Dial's current Chief Executive Officer
provide testimony and he is scheduled to give such testimony on April 2, 2002.
We are not able to predict what, if any, action that the SEC will take with
respect to this matter.

                                JOINDER AGREEMENT

         THIS JOINDER AGREEMENT (the "Agreement"), dated as of _____________,
____, is by and between _____________________, a ______________________ (the
"Subsidiary Guarantor"), and FIRST UNION NATIONAL BANK, in its capacity as
Administrative Agent under that certain Three Year Credit Agreement dated as of
March 27, 2002 (as it may be amended, modified, extended or restated from time
to time, the "Credit Agreement") by and among THE DIAL CORPORATION, a Delaware
corporation (the "Borrower"), the Domestic Subsidiaries of the Borrower
identified therein (the "Guarantors"), the Lenders party thereto and First Union
National Bank, as Administrative Agent (the "Administrative Agent"). Capitalized
terms used herein but not otherwise defined shall have the meanings provided in
the Credit Agreement.

         The Subsidiary Guarantor is an Additional Credit Party, and,
consequently, the Credit Parties are required by Section 6.9 of the Credit
Agreement to cause the Subsidiary Guarantor to become a "Guarantor" thereunder.

         Accordingly, the Subsidiary Guarantor hereby agrees as follows with the
Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Lenders:

         1.       The Subsidiary Guarantor hereby acknowledges, agrees and
confirms that, by its execution of this Agreement, the Subsidiary Guarantor will
be deemed to be a party to the Credit Agreement and a "Guarantor" for all
purposes of the Credit Agreement and the other Credit Documents, and shall have
all of the obligations of a Guarantor thereunder as if it had executed the
Credit Agreement and the other Credit Documents. The Subsidiary Guarantor hereby
ratifies, as of the date hereof, and agrees to be bound by, all of the terms,
provisions and conditions contained in the Credit Documents, including without
limitation (a) all of the representations and warranties of the Credit Parties
set forth in Section 5 of the Credit Agreement and (b) all of the affirmative
and negative covenants set forth in Sections 6 and 7 of the Credit Agreement.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing terms of this paragraph 1, the
Subsidiary Guarantor hereby jointly and severally together with the other
Guarantors, guarantees to each Lender and the Administrative Agent as provided
in the Credit Agreement the prompt payment and performance of the Credit Party
Obligations in full when due (whether at stated maturity, as a mandatory
prepayment, by acceleration, as a mandatory cash collateralization or otherwise)

collateralization or otherwise), the Subsidiary Guarantor will, jointly and
severally together with the other Guarantors, promptly pay and perform the same,
without any demand or notice whatsoever, and that in the case of any extension
of time of payment or renewal of any of the Credit Party Obligations, the same
will be promptly paid in full when due (whether at extended maturity, as a
mandatory prepayment, by acceleration, as a mandatory cash collateralization or
otherwise) in accordance with the terms of such extension or renewal.

         2.       The Subsidiary Guarantor acknowledges and confirms that it has

         3.       The Borrower and the Guarantors confirm that all of their

parties hereto confirm and agree that immediately upon the Subsidiary Guarantor
becoming a Guarantor, the term "Credit Party Obligations," as used in the Credit

         4.       The Subsidiary Guarantor hereby agrees that upon becoming a
Guarantor it will assume all Credit Party Obligations of a Guarantor as set

                                Schedule 10.6(c)

                                    [FORM OF]
                         COMMITMENT TRANSFER SUPPLEMENT

         Reference is made to the Three Year Credit Agreement, dated as of March
27, 2002 (as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the
"Credit Agreement"), among THE DIAL CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation (the
"Borrower"), the Domestic Subsidiaries of the Borrower identified therein (the
"Guarantors"), the banks and financial institutions from time to time parties
thereto (the "Lenders") and First Union National Bank, as administrative agent
for the Lenders (in such capacity, the "Administrative Agent"). Unless otherwise
defined herein, terms defined in the Credit Agreement and used herein shall have
the meanings provided in the Credit Agreement.

         ___________________________ (the "Transferor Lender") and
_________________________ (the "Purchasing Lender") agree as follows:

         1.       The Transferor Lender hereby irrevocably sells and assigns to
the Purchasing Lender without recourse to the Transferor Lender, and the
Purchasing Lender hereby irrevocably purchases and assumes from the Transferor
Lender without recourse to the Transferor Lender, as of the Transfer Effective
Date (as defined below), in and to the Transferor Lender's rights and
obligations under the Credit Agreement with respect to those credit facilities
contained in the Credit Agreement as are set forth on Schedule 1 attached hereto
(individually, an "Assigned Facility"; collectively, the "Assigned Facilities"),
in a principal amount for each Assigned Facility as set forth on such Schedule 1
(collectively, the "Assigned Interest"), together with the Commitment Percentage
corresponding to each such principal amount.

         2.       The Transferor Lender (a) makes no representation or warranty
and assumes no responsibility with respect to any statements, warranties or
representations made in or in connection with the Credit Agreement or with
respect to the execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness,
sufficiency or value of the Credit Agreement, any other Credit Document or any
other instrument or document furnished pursuant thereto, other than that the
Transferor Lender has not created any adverse claim upon the interest being
assigned by it hereunder and that such interest is free and clear of any such
adverse claim; (b) makes no representation or warranty and assumes no
responsibility with respect to the financial condition of any Credit Party or
any other obligor or the performance or observance by any Credit Party or any
other obligor of any of their respective obligations under the Credit Agreement
or any other Credit Document or any other instrument or document furnished
pursuant hereto or thereto; and (c) attaches any Note(s) held by it evidencing
the Assigned Facilities and (i) requests that the Administrative Agent exchange
the attached Note(s) for a new Note(s) payable to the Purchasing Lender and (ii)
if the Transferor Lender has retained any interest in the Assigned Facility,
requests that the Administrative Agent exchange the attached Note(s) for a new
Note(s) payable to the Transferor Lender, in each case in amounts which reflect
the assignment being made hereby (and after giving effect to any other
assignments which have become effective on the Transfer Effective Date).

         3.       The Purchasing Lender (a) represents and warrants that it is
legally authorized to enter into this Commitment Transfer Supplement; (b)
confirms that it has received a copy of the Credit Agreement, together with
copies of the financial statements referred to in Section 5.1 thereof, the
financial statements delivered pursuant to Section 6.1 thereof, if any, and such
other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate to make its own
credit analysis and decision to enter into this Commitment Transfer Supplement;
(c) agrees that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Transferor
Lender, the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents
and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its
own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under the Credit Agreement,
the other Credit Documents or any other instrument or document furnished
pursuant hereto or thereto; (d) appoints and authorizes the Administrative Agent
to take such action as agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers and
discretion under the Credit Agreement, the other loan documents

                                       2

<PAGE>

or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto or thereto as are
delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms thereof, together with such
powers as are incidental thereto; and (e) agrees that it will be bound by the
provisions of the Credit Agreement and will perform in accordance with its terms
all the obligations which by the terms of the Credit Agreement are required to
be performed by it as a Lender including, if it is organized under the laws of a
jurisdiction outside the United States, its obligations pursuant to Section 3.13
of the Credit Agreement.

         4.       The effective date of this Commitment Transfer Supplement
shall be ________ ___, 20__ (the "Transfer Effective Date"). Following the
execution of this Commitment Transfer Supplement, it will be delivered to the
Administrative Agent for acceptance by it and recording by the Administrative
Agent pursuant to the Credit Agreement, effective as of the Transfer Effective
Date, along with any registration and processing fee due and payable to the
Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 10.6 of the Credit Agreement.

         5.       Upon such acceptance and recording, from and after the
Transfer Effective Date, the Administrative Agent shall make all payments in
respect of the Assigned Interest (including payments of principal, interest,
fees and other amounts) to the Purchasing Lender whether such amounts have
accrued prior to the Transfer Effective Date or accrue subsequent to the
Transfer Effective Date. The Transferor Lender and the Purchasing Lender shall
make all appropriate adjustments in payments by the Administrative Agent for
periods prior to the Transfer Effective Date or, with respect to the making of
this assignment, directly between themselves.
