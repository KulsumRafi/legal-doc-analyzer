                        Administration ("FDA") or its foreign equivalent in a
                        country with reasonably comparable requirements within
                        forty eight (48) months from the identification of the
                        first lead compound; and

      2.    This Amendment shall not be deemed to alter in any manner any rights
            and/or obligations of either party except as specifically set forth

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Amendment, by proper
persons duly authorized.
