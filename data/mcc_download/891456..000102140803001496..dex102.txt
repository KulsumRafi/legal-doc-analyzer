"Merger") upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger
Agreement;

     WHEREAS, each Stockholder is executing this Agreement as an inducement to
PXP to enter into and execute the Merger Agreement; and

     WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
3TEC is entering into a voting agreement with certain PXP Stockholders (the "PXP
Stockholders") under which such parties have, among other things, agreed to

     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the execution and delivery by PXP of

contained herein and therein, the parties agree as follows:

          (i)  Such Stockholder is the record and beneficial owner of that
     number of shares of capital stock of 3TEC set forth opposite such
     Stockholder's name on Schedule A (together with any other shares of other
     capital stock of 3TEC acquired after the date hereof including through the
     exercise of any stock options, warrants or similar instruments) being
     collectively referred to herein as the "Subject Shares") and the other
     securities exercisable or exchangeable for such capital stock listed on
     Schedule A (the "Other Securities" and, together with the Subject Shares,
     the "Covered Securities"). The Subject Shares constitute the only shares,
     with respect to which such Stockholder is the record or beneficial owner,

     or restriction with respect to the voting or the Transfer of the Subject
     Shares, except (A) as provided by this Agreement (it being understood that
     any pledge of the Pledged Shares (as defined below) shall not be a breach
     of this representation) and (B) those arising under applicable securities
     laws. Such Stockholder has all requisite power and authority, and, if such
     Stockholder is a natural person, the legal capacity, to enter into this
     Agreement and to perform its obligations hereunder. To the extent that such
     Stockholder is an entity and not an individual, such Stockholder is duly
     organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its
     jurisdiction of organization. The execution and delivery of this Agreement
     by such Stockholder and the performance by such Stockholder of its
     obligations hereunder have been duly authorized by all necessary action on
     the part of such Stockholder. This Agreement has been duly executed and
     delivered by, and constitutes a valid and binding agreement of, such
     Stockholder, enforceable against such Stockholder in accordance with its
     terms, except as enforcement may be limited by the Enforceability
     Exceptions.

          (ii)  Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the
     performance by such Stockholder of its obligations hereunder will result in
     a violation of, or a default under, or conflict with, (A) if such
     Stockholder is an entity, any provision of its certificate of
     incorporation, bylaws, partnership agreement, limited liability company
     agreement or similar organizational documents, (B) any contract, trust,
     commitment, agreement, understanding, arrangement or restriction of any
     kind (other than as may relate to the Pledged Shares but subject to the
     proviso set forth in (iv) below) to which such Stockholder is a party or
     bound or to which the Covered Securities are subject, except, in the case
     of clause (B), as would not prevent, delay or otherwise materially impair
     such Stockholder's ability to perform its obligations hereunder. Execution,
     delivery and performance of this Agreement by such Stockholder will not
     violate, or require any consent, approval or notice under, any provision of
     any judgment, order, decree, statute, law, rule or regulation applicable to
     such Stockholder or the Covered Securities, except (x) for any reports
     under Sections 13(d) and 16 of the Exchange Act as may be required in
     connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby or
     (y) as would not reasonably be expected to prevent, delay or otherwise
     materially impair such Stockholder's ability to perform its obligations
     hereunder.

          (iii) If the Stockholder is married and the Covered Securities of the
     Stockholder constitute community property or spousal approval is otherwise
     required for this Agreement to be legal, valid and binding, then, to the
     extent so required, this Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and
     delivered by, and constitutes a valid and binding agreement of, the
     Stockholder's spouse, enforceable against such spouse in accordance with
     its terms, subject to the Enforceability Exceptions.

          (iv)  The Covered Securities and the certificates representing such
     Covered Securities are held by such Stockholder, or by a nominee or
     custodian for the benefit of such Stockholder, free and clear of all liens,
     claims, security interests, proxies, voting trusts or agreements,
     understandings or arrangements or any other encumbrances whatsoever, except
     for (A) any such encumbrances arising hereunder, or (B) any such
     encumbrances arising pursuant to the pledge of any Covered Securities by
     such

     Stockholder to a financial institution or a brokerage firm (the "Pledged
     Shares"); provided, however, that such Stockholder represents that any such
     arrangement regarding such Pledged Shares shall not prevent, delay or
     otherwise materially impair such Stockholder's ability to execute and
     deliver this Agreement or perform its obligations hereunder and such
     Stockholder shall use his reasonable efforts to obtain an acknowledgment by
     the pledgee of the terms of this Agreement and such pledgee's agreement to
     vote the Pledged Shares (if and to the extent the voting power of the
     Pledged Shares is being or to be exercised by pledgee) in accordance with
     Section 2.

          (v)  No broker, investment banker, financial advisor or other person
     is entitled to any broker's, finder's, financial advisor's or other similar
     fee or commission based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of such
     Stockholder in connection with its entering into this Agreement.

          (vi) Such Stockholder understands and acknowledges that PXP is
     entering into the Merger Agreement in reliance upon such Stockholder's
     execution and delivery of this Agreement.

     (b)  PXP represents and warrants to each Stockholder and 3TEC that the

other Transactions and (b) against any transaction, agreement, matter or 3TEC
Acquisition Proposal that would impede, interfere with, delay, postpone or
attempt to discourage the Merger and the Merger Agreement.

of 3TEC (including any adjournments and postponements thereof) on the matters

fulfill such Stockholder's obligations under this Agreement. This proxy is
coupled with an interest and is irrevocable until the end of the Term.

     (d)  The headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes
only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement.

     (e)  This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, all of
which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective
as to any Stockholder when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of
PXP, 3TEC and such Stockholder and delivered to PXP, 3TEC and such Stockholder.

     (f)  This Agreement (including the documents and instruments referred to
herein) constitutes the entire agreement, and supersedes all prior agreements

subject matter hereof, and this Agreement is not intended to confer upon any
other person (other than PXP) any rights or remedies hereunder.

     (g)  This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with,
the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws that might otherwise

under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by operation of law

     (i)  As between any Stockholder and PXP, each of such parties agrees that
irreparable damage to the other, non-breaching party would occur and that such
non-breaching party would not have any adequate remedy at law in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that

application thereof to any circumstance, shall, to any extent, be held by a
court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the

application thereof to any other circumstances shall remain in full force and
effect, shall not in any way be affected, impaired or invalidated, and shall be
enforced to the fullest extent permitted by law.

     (k)  No amendment, modification or waiver in respect of this Agreement
shall be effective against any party unless it shall be in writing and signed by
such party.
