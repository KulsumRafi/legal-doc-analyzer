<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This
agreement is entered into as of November&nbsp;1, 2002 between Asbury Automotive Group,&nbsp;Inc. ("Asbury") and Thomas F. Gilman ("Executive"), a key employee of Asbury, in

<UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>If
a Termination (as defined below) of Executive's employment occurs at any time during Executive's employment, Asbury will pay Executive 12&nbsp;months of Executive's base salary as of the date of
Termination as Severance Pay. Payment (subject to required withholding) will be made by Asbury to Executive monthly on the regular payroll dates of Asbury starting with the date of Termination. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>If
Executive participates in a bonus compensation plan at the date of Termination, Severance Pay will also include a portion of the target bonus for the year of Termination in an amount equal to the
target bonus multiplied by the percentage of such year that has expired through the date of Termination. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>In
addition, Executive shall be entitled for 12&nbsp;months following the date of Termination to continue to participate at the same level of coverage and Executive contribution in any health,
dental, disability and life insurance plans, as may be amended from time to time, in which Executive was participating immediately prior to the date of Termination. Such participation will terminate
30&nbsp;days after Executive has obtained other employment under which Executive is covered by equal benefits. Executive agrees to notify Asbury promptly upon obtaining such other employment. At the
option of Executive, COBRA coverage will be available, as provided by company policy, at the termination of the extended benefits provided above. </FONT></P>

agreement shall be replaced with "36&nbsp;months" and (2)&nbsp;the term "one year" in Section&nbsp;5 and Section&nbsp;6 of this agreement shall be replaced with "36&nbsp;months". For
