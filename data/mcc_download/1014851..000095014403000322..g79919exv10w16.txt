respective meanings given to them in the Credit Agreement);

         WHEREAS, on the date hereof, USPL has paid all of its obligations under
the Credit Agreement other than $1,000,000 of principal;

         WHEREAS, the Company has agreed to assume all of the remaining
obligations of USPL under the Credit Agreement, which obligations are to be

         WHEREAS, in consideration for such assumption by the Company, USPL has
agreed to transfer to the Company, subject to the existing security interest of
the Administrative Agent, all of its right, title and interest in the Quakertown
Claim; and

         WHEREAS, concurrently with such transfer, the Company and the
Administrative Agent will enter into a Second Amended and Restated Security
Agreement (the "Restated Security Agreement") to set forth their agreements with
respect to the Administrative Agent's security interest in, and rights with
respect to, the Quakertown Claim;

         NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing, USPL and the Company
hereby agree as follows:

         1. Effective immediately, USPL hereby irrevocably contributes, assigns,
transfers and conveys to the Company all of USPL's right, title and interest in
and to the Quakertown Claim, together with all proceeds, products, profits and
returns of and from, all rights to prosecute, settle or otherwise pursue, and
all distributions on and rights arising out of, the Quakertown Claim (all of the
foregoing, the "Quakertown Rights"), subject to the existing security interest
of the Administrative Agent under the Security Agreement.

         2. The Company hereby (a) assumes all rights and obligations of USPL
under the Credit Agreement, which obligations shall be evidenced from and after
the date hereof by the Quakertown Notes, (b) acknowledges receipt of the
Quakertown Rights from USPL and (c) acknowledges that the Quakertown Rights are
and shall continue to be subject to the security interest created by the
Security Agreement (or, after the amendment and restatement thereof, the
