     2. No Other  Amendment  or Waiver.  Notwithstanding  the  agreement  of the
Lenders  to the  terms  and  provisions  of this  Agreement,  the  Loan  Parties
acknowledge  and  expressly  agree that this  Agreement is limited to the extent

          (b) This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by

          (c) The execution and delivery of this  Agreement and the  performance
     by the Loan Parties under the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents
     to which each is a party,  as amended  hereby,  do not and will not require

     contravention of or in conflict with the articles of incorporation, by-laws
     or partnership agreements of the Loan Parties or any of their Subsidiaries,
     or any provision of any statute,  judgment,  order, or material  indenture,
     instrument, agreement, or undertaking to which Loan Parties or any of their
