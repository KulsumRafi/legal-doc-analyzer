<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 6.1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Grant</U>.  A Participant may be granted Restricted Stock under the Plan.  Restricted Stock shall be subject to such terms and conditions, consistent with the other provisions of the Plan, as shall be determined by the Committee in its sole discretion.  Restricted Stock shall be awarded on the condition that the Participant remain in the employ of the Company or one of its Subsidiaries during the Restricted Period.  Such condition shall have no effect on the right of the Company or any Subsidiary to terminate the Participant's employment at any time.  No payment is required from a Participant for an award of Restricted Stock.</P>

<P>such termination automatically shall be forfeited and returned to the Company.  For purposes of the Plan, the following shall not be deemed a termination of employment:  (i)&nbsp;a transfer of employment among the Company and its Subsidiaries; (ii)&nbsp;a leave of absence, duly authorized in writing by the Company, for military service or for any other purpose approved by the Company if the period of such leave does not exceed 90 days; (iii)&nbsp;a leave of absence in excess of 90 days, duly authorized in writing by the Company, provided the employee's right to reemployment is guaranteed either by statute or contract; or (iv)&nbsp;a termination of employment with continued service as an officer or director.  For purposes of the Plan, termination of employment shall be considered to occur on the date on which the employee is no longer obligated to perform services for the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and the employee's right to reemployment is not guaranteed either by statute or contract, regardless of whether the employee continues to receive compensation from the Company or any of its Subsidiaries after such date.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (b)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Death</U> <U>or</U> <U>Total</U> <U>Disability</U>.  Unless the terms of the Restricted Stock agreement or grant provide otherwise, in the event a Participant terminates employment or directorship with the Company or one of its Subsidiaries because of death or Total Disability during the Restricted Period, the restrictions applicable to the shares of Restricted Stock automatically shall terminate and the Restricted Stock shall vest as of the date of termination.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 7.1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Grant</U>.  A Participant may be granted Tax Benefit Rights under the Plan to encourage a Participant to exercise Options and provide certain tax benefits to the Company.

<P>for federal tax purposes as a result of the exercise of a non-qualified stock option, or the disqualifying disposition of shares acquired under an incentive stock option, by the maximum federal income tax rate (including any surtax or similar charge or assessment) for corporations, plus any other applicable state and local tax against which the Company is entitled to a deduction or credit by reason of exercise of the Option or the disqualifying disposition.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 7.2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Restrictions</U>.  A Tax Benefit Right may be granted only with respect to an Option issued and outstanding or to be issued under the Plan or any other Plan of the Company or its Subsidiaries that has been approved by the shareholders as of the effective date of the Plan and may be granted concurrently with or after the grant of the Option.  Such rights with respect to outstanding Options shall be issued only with the consent of the Participant if the effect would be to disqualify an incentive stock option, change the date of grant or the exercise price or otherwise impair the Participant's existing Options.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 7.3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Terms</U> <U>and</U> <U>Conditions</U>.  The Committee shall determine the terms and conditions of any Tax Benefit Rights granted and the Participants to whom such rights will be granted with respect to Options under the Plan or any other plan of the Company and those terms and conditions shall be set forth in written agreements.  The Committee may amend, cancel, limit the term of, or limit the amount payable under a Tax Benefit Right at any time before the exercise of the related stock option, unless otherwise provided under the terms of the Tax Benefit Right.  The net amount of a Tax Benefit Right, subject to withholding, may be used to pay a portion of the Option price, unless otherwise provided by the Committee.</P>

The Committee also may include provisions for Participants to receive cash in lieu of outstanding Options upon a Change in Control of the Company.</P>

No Participant or other person shall have any claim to be granted any Incentive Award, and there is no obligation of uniformity of treatment of employees, Participants or holders or beneficiaries of Incentive Awards.

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 9.2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Withholding</U>.  The Company or a Subsidiary shall be entitled to (a) withhold and deduct from future wages of a Participant (or from other amounts that may be due and owing to a Participant from the Company or a Subsidiary), or make other arrangements for the collection of, all amounts deemed necessary to satisfy any and all federal, state and local withholding and employment-related tax requirements attributable to an Incentive Award, including, without limitation, the grant, exercise or vesting of, or payment of dividends with respect to, an Incentive Award or a disqualifying disposition of Common Stock received upon exercise of an incentive stock option; or (b) require a Participant promptly to remit the amount of such withholding to the Company before taking any action with respect to an Incentive Award.  Unless the Committee determines otherwise, withholding may be satisfied by withholding Common Stock to be received upon exercise or by delivery to the Company of previously owned Common Stock.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 9.3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Compliance</U> <U>With</U> <U>Laws</U>; <U>Listing</U> <U>and</U> <U>Registration</U> <U>of</U> <U>Shares</U>.  All Incentive Awards granted under the Plan (and all issuances of Common Stock or other securities under the Plan) shall be subject to applicable laws, rules and regulations, and to the requirement that if at any time the Committee determines, in its sole discretion, that the listing, registration or qualification of the shares covered thereby upon any securities exchange or under any state or federal law, or the consent or approval of any governmental regulatory body, is necessary or desirable as a condition of, or in connection with, the granting of such Incentive Award or the issue or purchase of shares thereunder, such Incentive Award may not be exercised in whole or in part, or the restrictions on such Incentive Award shall not lapse, unless and until such listing, registration, qualification, consent or approval shall have been effected or obtained free of any conditions not acceptable to the Committee.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 9.4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>No</U> <U>Limit</U> <U>on</U> <U>Other</U> <U>Compensation</U> <U>Arrangements</U>.  Nothing contained in the Plan shall prevent the Company or any Subsidiary from adopting or continuing in effect other or additional compensation arrangements, including the grant of options and other stock-based awards, and such arrangements may be either generally applicable or applicable only in specific cases.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 9.5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>No</U> <U>Right</U> <U>to</U> <U>Employment</U>.  The grant of an Incentive Award shall not be construed as giving a Participant the right to be retained in the employ or directorship of the Company or any Subsidiary.  The Company or any Subsidiary may at any time dismiss a Participant from employment, free from any liability or any claim under the Plan, unless otherwise expressly provided in the Plan or in any written agreement with a Participant.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 9.6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Governing</U> <U>Law</U>.  The validity, construction and effect of the Plan and any rules and regulations relating to the Plan shall be determined in accordance with the laws of the State of Michigan and applicable federal law.</P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 9.7&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U>Severability</U>.  In the event any provision of the Plan shall be held illegal or invalid for any reason, the illegality or invalidity shall not affect the remaining parts of the Plan, and the Plan shall be construed and enforced as if the illegal or invalid provision had not been included.</P>
