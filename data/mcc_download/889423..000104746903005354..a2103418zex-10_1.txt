                                   BACKGROUND

         Reference is made to the loan arrangement maintained between the Lender

a certain Forbearance Agreement entered into by the Lender and the Borrower
dated as of December 19, 2002, as amended on January 17, 2003 (as amended, the

used in this Agreement and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings
as defined in the Forbearance Agreement.

         The Borrower has requested that the Lender revise certain terms of the
Forbearance Agreement relating to Termination Events and Lender has agreed, but
only upon the terms and conditions set forth herein.

         Accordingly, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, it is hereby agreed by and between
the Lender and the Borrower, as follows:

                           connection with the Loan Documents.

                  (c)      Hereinafter all amounts due as set forth in this

         2.       The Borrower hereby acknowledges and agrees that it has no

                  Lender, or its officers, directors, employees, attorneys,
                  representatives, parent, affiliates, predecessors, successors,
                  or assigns with respect to the Loan Documents, the
                  Obligations, or otherwise, and that if the Borrower now has,
                  or ever did have, any offsets, defenses, claims, or

                  employees, attorneys, representatives, parent, affiliates,

                  through this date and through the time of execution of this
                  Agreement, all of them are hereby expressly WAIVED, and the
                  Borrower hereby RELEASES the Lender, and its officers,
                  directors, employees, attorneys, representatives, parent,
                  affiliates, predecessors, successors, and assigns from any

                         RATIFICATION OF LOAN DOCUMENTS

         3.       The Borrower hereby ratifies, confirms, and reaffirms all and
                  singular the terms and conditions of the Loan Documents. The
                  Borrower further acknowledges and agrees that, except as
                  specifically modified in this Agreement, all terms and
                  conditions of the Loan Documents shall remain in full force
                  and effect including, without limitation, the requirement of
                  the payment of the Additional Fees set forth in Section 11 of
                  the Forbearance Agreement.

                       AMENDMENTS TO FORBEARANCE AGREEMENT

         4.       The Forbearance Agreement is hereby amended as follows:

                           (i) Section 5 of the Forbearance Agreement is hereby
                           amended by deleting same in its entirety and
                           replacing it with the following:

                           "The Borrower acknowledges and agrees that during the
                           term of this Forbearance Agreement, the Lender shall
                           have no obligation to make any further Loans or other
                           advances to the Borrower. Notwithstanding the
                           foregoing, the Lender shall, on or about February 11,
                           2003, provide a Loan to the Borrower in the amount of
                           $245,000.00. The making of such Loan shall not
                           constitute a waiver of any Event of Default, whether
                           now existing or hereafter arising, nor shall the
                           making of such Loan obligate the Lender to make any
                           future Loans or advances to the Borrower."
