terms used herein shall have the same meaning as in the Credit Agreement unless
otherwise defined herein.

      The Administrative Agent, the Banks and the Borrowers wish to amend the
Credit Agreement to reestablish the Revolving Credit Commitments, to extend the
Termination Date to December 31, 2003, to change the interest rate provisions of
the Credit Agreement and to amend certain other provisions of the Credit
Agreement, all in the manner set forth in this Amendment.

1.  AMENDMENTS.

      Upon satisfaction of all of the conditions precedent set forth in Section
2 hereof, the following provisions of the Credit Agreement shall be amended,
effective as of December 31, 2002, as follows:

      1.1. Section 1.1(a) of the Credit Agreement shall be amended to read as
follows:

                        Section 1.1. The Revolving Credit. (a) Subject to all of
            the terms and conditions hereof, the Revolving Credit Lenders agree
            to extend a Revolving Credit to the Borrowers which may be availed
            of by the Borrowers in their discretion from time to time, be repaid
            and used again, during the period from the Fifth Amendment Effective
            Date to and including December 31, 2003 (the "Termination Date").
            The Revolving Credit may be utilized by the Borrowers in the form of
            loans (individually a "Revolving Credit Loan" and collectively the
<PAGE>
            "Revolving Credit Loans") and letters of credit (individually a
            "L/C" and collectively the "L/Cs"), provided that the aggregate
            amount of the principal amount of the outstanding Revolving Credit
            Loans, the aggregate amount available to be drawn under all
            outstanding L/Cs and, without duplication, the aggregate amount of
            unpaid Reimbursement Obligations with respect to L/Cs (collectively,
            the "Revolving Credit Obligations") at any one time shall not exceed
            the Revolving Credit Commitments, provided further, that in no event
            may SVS Holland obtain the issuance of L/Cs under the Revolving
            Credit and in no event may SVS Holland borrow or reborrow Revolving
            Credit Loans from and after the Fifth Amendment Effective Date.

                  As of January 13, 2003, the respective initial maximum
            aggregate principal amounts of the Revolving Credit at any one time
            outstanding and the percentage of the Revolving Credit available at
            any time which each Revolving Credit Lender agrees to make available
            to the Borrowers (its "Commitment Percentage") are as follows

      1.3. Section 1.4(a) of the Credit Agreement shall be amended to read as
follows:

                  "Section 1.4. Letters of Credit. (a) Subject to all the terms
            and conditions hereof, Harris shall issue L/Cs for the account of
            the Domestic Borrowers subject to availability under the Revolving
            Credit, and the Revolving Credit Lenders hereby agree to participate
            therein as more fully described in Section 1.6 hereof. Each L/C
            shall be issued pursuant to an application for letter of credit (an
            "L/C Agreement") in the form attached hereto as Exhibit C. The L/C's
            shall consist of stand-by letters of credit in an aggregate undrawn
            amount not to exceed $2,000,000. Each L/C shall conform to the
            general requirements of Harris for letters of credit as to form and
            substance, shall be in U.S. Dollars, shall be a letter of credit
            which Harris may lawfully issue and shall have an expiry date not
            more than one year from the date of issuance thereof (but in no
            event later than the Termination Date). The amount available under
            each L/C issued pursuant hereto shall be deducted from the credit
            otherwise available under the Revolving Credit. In consideration of
            the issuance of L/Cs each Domestic Borrower jointly and severally
            agrees to pay Harris a fee (the "L/C Participation Fee") in the
            amount per annum equal to three and one-half of one percent (3.5%)
            (computed on the basis of a 360-day year and actual days elapsed) of
            the undrawn amount for each L/C issued for the account of the
            Domestic Borrowers hereunder. In addition, the Domestic Borrowers
            shall pay Harris a fee (the "L/C Issuance Fee") in the amount equal
            to the greater of $300 and one-eighth of one percent (0.125%) of the
            stated amount of each L/C issued hereunder and such drawing,
            negotiation, amendment and other administrative fees in connection
            with each L/C as may be generally established by Harris from time to
            time for letters of credit issued by it of that type for each L/C
            (the "L/C Administrative Fee"). All L/C Participation Fees shall be
            payable monthly in arrears on the last day of each calendar month
            and on the Termination Date, and all L/C Administrative Fees and L/C
            Issuance Fees shall be payable on the date of issuance of each L/C
            hereunder and on the date required by Harris."

subsection (d) thereof.

      1.5. Section 2.1 of the Credit Agreement shall be amended to read as
follows:

                  "Section 2.1. Interest. All Loans and unpaid Reimbursement
            Obligations shall bear interest (which the Borrowers jointly and
            severally promise to pay at the times herein provided), at the rate
            per annum equal to the greater of (a) the sum of the Base Rate in
            effect from time to time and three and one-half of one percent
            (3.5%), and (b) the sum of nine percent (9%) and the Incremental
            Interest Rate, provided that upon the occurrence and during the
            continuation of an Event of Default all Loans and unpaid

            jointly and severally promise to pay at the times herein provided),
            at the rate per annum determined by adding two and one-half of one
            percent (2.5%) to the rate of interest otherwise applicable thereto.

            Rate during the period commencing April 1, 2003 and ending June 30,

follows:

                  "Section 3.1. Fees and Other Amounts. (a) The Borrowers agree

            the occurrence of the Restructuring Fee Payment Date the Revolving
            Credit Commitments have been terminated, all Loans and Reimbursement
            Obligations have been paid in full and no L/Cs are outstanding, the

            to this Section 3.1(c) through the effective date of such
            termination in whole shall be paid on the date of such earlier
            termination in whole.

                  (d) In consideration of the execution and delivery by the

            indebtedness evidenced by the Notes and the Reimbursement
            Obligations have become due and payable pursuant to Section 8.2 or
            8.3 of this Agreement."

      1.7. Section 3.3(b) of the Credit Agreement shall be amended to read as

directors, employees, agents, attorneys, affiliates, subsidiaries, successors
and assigns, from any liability, claim, right or cause of action which now
exists or hereafter arises as a result of acts, omissions or events occurring on
or prior to the date hereof, whether known or unknown, in connection with the
Credit Agreement, the Notes and the other Loan Documents.

     4.3. Reference to this specific Amendment need not be made in any note,
document, letter, certificate, the Credit Agreement itself, or any communication
issued or made pursuant to or with respect to the Credit Agreement, any
reference to the Credit Agreement being sufficient to refer to the Credit
Agreement as amended hereby.

     4.4. This Amendment may be executed in any number of counterparts, and by
the different parties on different counterparts, all of which taken together
shall constitute one and the same agreement. Any of the parties hereby may
execute this Amendment by signing any such counterpart and each of such
counterparts shall for all purposes be deemed to be an original. This Amendment
shall be governed by the internal laws of the State of Illinois.

     4.5. Except as specifically modified hereby, the Credit Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect in accordance with its terms. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, this Amendment shall not extinguish the Loans,
Reimbursement Obligations or any other indebtedness, obligations and liabilities
of the Borrowers under the Credit Agreement or the other Loan Documents, and
nothing contained herein shall be construed as a substitution or novation of the
Loans, Reimbursement Obligations or any other indebtedness, obligations and
liabilities of the Borrowers under the Credit Agreement and the other Loan
Documents, which shall remain outstanding thereunder as modified hereby.
