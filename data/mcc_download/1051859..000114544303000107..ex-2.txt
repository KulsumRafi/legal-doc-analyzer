                  MERGER PROPOSED - YOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT

Marked Tree Bancshares Stockholders:

      This document is being furnished to you in connection with the
solicitation of proxies by Marked Tree Bancshares' board of directors for use at
a special meeting of Marked Tree Bancshares stockholders. The special meeting is
scheduled to be held on March __, 2003, at the office of Marked Tree Bank, 210
Frisco Street, Marked Tree, Arkansas at __:__ _.m., Central time. At the special
meeting, Marked Tree Bancshares stockholders will be asked to consider and vote
upon the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of November 27, 2002, by and
between Pocahontas Bancorp, Inc. and Marked Tree Bancshares, pursuant to which
Marked Tree Bancshares will be acquired by Pocahontas Bancorp.

      In connection with the merger, each share of Marked Tree Bancshares common
stock outstanding immediately prior to consummation of the merger (other than
shares held directly by Marked Tree Bancshares, or shares the holders of which
have perfected dissenters' rights of appraisal) will be converted into the
number of shares of Pocahontas Bancorp common stock determined by dividing the
stated book value per share of Marked Tree Bancshares by the stated book value
per share of Pocahontas Bancorp. Stated book value per share will be calculated
as of the last calendar quarter-end prior to the consummation of the merger. The
exchange ratio is subject to adjustment if the trading price of Pocahontas
Bancorp common stock fluctuates beyond certain levels as described in the proxy
statement/prospectus.

      We encourage you to read the proxy statement/prospectus, which includes
important information about the merger. In addition, the section entitled "Risk
Factors" beginning on page 6 of the proxy statement/prospectus contains a
description of risks that you should consider in evaluating the merger.

      Consummation of the merger is conditional on, among other things, receipt
of all required stockholder and regulatory approvals. Your board of directors
recommends that you vote in favor of the merger agreement and the merger, which
the board believes is in the best interests of the stockholders of Marked Tree
Bancshares.

      We have enclosed a notice of the special meeting, a proxy
statement/prospectus containing a discussion of the merger agreement and the
merger and a proxy to record your vote on the matters submitted for stockholder
action at the special meeting. Please complete, sign and date the enclosed proxy
and return it as soon as possible in the envelope provided. It is important to
understand that the merger agreement and the merger must be approved by the
holders of at least two-thirds of all outstanding shares of Marked Tree
Bancshares common stock and that the failure to vote will have the same effect
as a vote against the proposal.

                  NOTICE OF SPECIAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS
                         TO BE HELD ON MARCH __, 2003

      NOTICE IS HEREBY GIVEN that a special meeting of stockholders of Marked
Tree Bancshares, Inc. is scheduled to be held on March __, 2003, at the office
of Marked Tree Bank, 210 Frisco Street, Marked Tree, Arkansas at __:__ _.m.,
Central time.

      A proxy and a proxy statement/prospectus for the special meeting are
enclosed, as well as Pocahontas Bancorp's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
fiscal year ended September 30, 2002. The special meeting is being held to
consider and vote upon the following matters:

      o     a proposal to adopt the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of
            November 27, 2002, pursuant to which Marked Tree Bancshares will be
            merged with and into Pocahontas Bancorp; and

      o     such other business as may properly come before the special meeting
            or any adjournments of the meeting.

      In the merger, Pocahontas Bancorp will be the surviving corporation, and
each outstanding share of Marked Tree Bancshares common stock will be converted
into shares of Pocahontas Bancorp common stock based on an exchange ratio as
described in the proxy statement/prospectus (with cash paid in lieu of
fractional share interests).

      Your attention is directed to the proxy statement/prospectus for a
complete discussion of the merger. A copy of the merger agreement is included as
Appendix I to the proxy statement/prospectus.

      The board of directors has established February __, 2003 as the record
date for the determination of stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at
the special meeting and at any adjournment thereof. Only Marked Tree Bancshares
stockholders as of the close of business on that date will be entitled to notice
of and to vote at the special meeting or any adjournment thereof. A majority of
the outstanding shares of Marked Tree Bancshares entitled to vote, represented
in person or by proxy, will constitute a quorum at the special meeting. In order
for the merger agreement to be adopted, the holders of at least two-thirds of
the outstanding shares of Marked Tree Bancshares common stock on the record date
must vote in favor of the merger agreement. Therefore, your vote is very
important.

      All Marked Tree Bancshares stockholders entitled to notice of, and to vote
at, the special meeting are cordially invited to attend the special meeting in
person. However, to ensure your representation at the special meeting, please
submit your proxy with voting instructions. You may submit your proxy with
voting instructions by mail if you promptly complete, sign, date and return the
accompanying proxy card in the enclosed self-addressed stamped envelope. This
will not prevent you from voting in person, but it will help to secure a quorum
and avoid added solicitation costs. Any holder of Marked Tree Bancshares common
stock who is present at the special meeting may vote in person instead of by
proxy, thereby cancelling any previous proxy. In any event, a proxy may be
revoked in writing at any time before the special meeting.

      As a stockholder of Marked Tree Bancshares, you have the right to dissent
from the merger and demand payment of the fair value of your shares of Marked
Tree Bancshares common stock under applicable provisions of Arkansas law. In
order to perfect dissenters' rights, you must give written demand before the
merger is voted on at the special meeting and must not vote in favor of the
merger. An excerpt from Arkansas law regarding dissenters' rights is included as
Appendix II to the proxy statement/prospectus and a summary of these provisions
can be found under "THE MERGER - Dissenters' Rights."
<PAGE>

      Your board of directors has unanimously approved the merger agreement and
unanimously recommends that you vote "FOR" adoption of the merger agreement.

      YOUR VOTE IS IMPORTANT. PLEASE COMPLETE, SIGN, DATE AND RETURN YOUR PROXY
CARD PROMPTLY, WHETHER OR NOT YOU PLAN TO ATTEND THE SPECIAL MEETING.

                                    By Order of the Board of Directors

    QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT VOTING PROCEDURES FOR THE SPECIAL MEETING

Q: What do I need to do now?

A: After you have carefully read this document, indicate on your proxy card how
you want your shares to be voted. Then complete, sign, date and mail your proxy
card in the enclosed postage paid return envelope as soon as possible. This will
enable your shares to be represented and voted at the special meeting.

Q: Why is my vote important?

A: If you do not return your proxy card or vote in person at the special
meeting, it will be more difficult for Marked Tree Bancshares to obtain the
necessary quorum to hold the special meeting. In addition, the failure of a
stockholder to vote, by proxy or in person, will have the same effect as a vote
against the merger agreement. The merger must be approved by the holders of at
least two-thirds of the outstanding shares of Marked Tree Bancshares common
stock at the special meeting called for the purpose of voting on the proposal to
adopt the merger agreement.

Q: Can I attend the special meeting and vote my shares in person?

A: Yes. All stockholders are invited to attend the special meeting. Stockholders
of record can vote in person at the special meeting.

Q: Can I change my vote?

A: Yes. There are three ways you can change your vote after you have submitted
your proxy card.

      o     First, you may send a written notice to the person to whom you
            submitted your proxy stating that you would like to revoke your
            proxy.

      o     Second, you may complete and submit a new proxy card. The
            latest-dated proxy card actually received by Marked Tree Bancshares
            before the special meeting will be counted, and any earlier votes
            will be revoked.

      o     Third, you may attend the special meeting and vote in person. Any
            earlier proxy will thereby be revoked. However, simply attending the
            special meeting without voting will not revoke your proxy.

Q: Should I send in my stock certificates now?

A: No. You should not send in your stock certificates at this time. You will
need to exchange your stock certificates for Pocahontas Bancorp stock
certificates after we complete the merger. We will send you instructions for
exchanging your stock certificates at that time.

Q: When do you expect to complete the merger?

A: We expect to complete the merger during the first or second calendar quarter
of 2003. However, we cannot assure you when or if the merger will occur. We must
first obtain the approval of our stockholders at the special meeting and the
necessary regulatory approvals.

Q: Whom should I call with questions?

A: You should call Mr. E. Ritter Arnold, President and Chief Executive Officer,
at (870) 358-2600 with any questions about the merger and related transactions.

                                   SUMMARY

      This summary highlights selected information from this document. It does
not contain all of the information that is important to you. We urge you to read
carefully the entire document and the other documents to which we refer in order
to fully understand the merger and the related transactions. See "WHERE YOU CAN
FIND MORE INFORMATION" on page 44. Each item in this summary refers to the page
of this document on which that subject is discussed in more detail.

You Will Receive Shares of Pocahontas Bancorp Common Stock for Your Shares of
Marked Tree Bancshares (page 22)

      As a result of the merger, for each share of Marked Tree Bancshares that
you own, you will receive the number of shares of Pocahontas Bancorp common
stock determined by dividing the stated book value per share of Marked Tree
Bancshares by the stated book value per share of Pocahontas Bancorp. Stated book
value per share will be calculated as of the last calendar quarter-end prior to
the consummation of the merger. For example, assuming the merger were to be
consummated before March 31, 2003, the stated book value per share would be
calculated as of December 31, 2002. As of that date, the stated book value per
share of Pocahontas Bancorp was $11.10 and the stated book value per share of
Marked Tree Bancshares was $1,152.82 accordingly, the number of shares of
Pocahontas Bancorp common stock that you would receive for each share of Marked
Tree Bancshares that you own would be 103.86 (determined by dividing $1,152.82
by $11.10).

      The exchange ratio, determined as provided above, is subject to
adjustment. If the average of the closing prices of Pocahontas Bancorp common
stock on the NASDAQ National Market for the 20 consecutive trading days ending
on the fifth business day before the merger is consummated is more than 15%
higher or more than 15% lower than $10.35, then the exchange ratio will be
decreased by the percentage by which that average market value is higher than
$10.35 or increased by the percentage by which that market value is lower than
$10.35, respectively.

      The market price of Pocahontas Bancorp common stock will fluctuate prior
to the consummation of the merger.

This Transaction is Generally Tax-Free to Marked Tree Bancshares Stockholders
(page 34)

      The merger has been structured as a tax-free reorganization for federal
income tax purposes. Accordingly, holders of Marked Tree Bancshares common stock
generally will not recognize any gain or loss for federal income tax purposes on
the exchange of their Marked Tree Bancshares common stock for Pocahontas Bancorp
common stock in the merger, except for any gain or loss that may result from the
receipt of cash instead of a fractional share of Pocahontas Bancorp common
stock. It is a condition to the obligations of Marked Tree Bancshares and
Pocahontas Bancorp to complete the merger that each receive an opinion from tax
counsel that the merger will be a tax-free reorganization for federal income tax
purposes.

      The federal income tax consequences described above may not apply to some
holders of Marked Tree Bancshares common stock. Your tax consequences will
depend on your own personal situation. Accordingly, we strongly urge you to
consult your tax advisor for a full understanding of the particular tax
consequences of the merger to you.

Pocahontas Bancorp's Dividend Policy (page 27)

      During 2002, Pocahontas Bancorp paid cash dividends totaling $0.285 per
share. Pocahontas Bancorp currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.08 per
share, which is expected to continue, although the Pocahontas Bancorp board of
directors may change this dividend policy at any time.

      During 2002, Marked Tree Bancshares paid no cash dividends. The merger
agreement prohibits the payment of dividends by Marked Tree Bancshares prior to
the completion of the merger.

Our Reasons for the Merger (page 24)

      The board of directors of Marked Tree Bancshares supports the merger and
believes it is in your best interests. The board believes the merger will permit
you to have an equity interest in a resulting financial institution that has
greater financial resources and a larger stockholder base, which will increase
liquidity and marketability of the combined entity's capital stock. The board of


                                       2

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<PAGE>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

directors also believes that the terms of the merger are fair and equitable to
you. Finally, the board of directors believes that, following the merger, the
size of the combined organization, which would have approximately $674.9 million
in consolidated assets as of December 31, 2002, is sufficiently large to take
advantage over time of significant economies of scale, but is still small enough
to maintain the competitive advantages of community-oriented banks.

Marked Tree Bancshares' Board of Directors Recommends You Vote FOR Adoption
of the Merger Agreement (page 21)

      Marked Tree Bancshares' board of directors believes that the merger is
fair to Marked Tree Bancshares' stockholders and in the best interests of Marked
Tree Bancshares and its stockholders and has unanimously approved the merger
agreement. Marked Tree Bancshares' board of directors unanimously recommends
that Marked Tree Bancshares stockholders vote "FOR" adoption of the merger
agreement.

Rights of Dissenting Stockholders (see page 28)

      As a stockholder of Marked Tree Bancshares, you are entitled to dissent
from the merger and to demand payment of the fair value of your common stock in
cash if you follow certain statutory provisions regarding the rights of
dissenting stockholders under Arkansas law.

The Merger Agreement

      The merger agreement is attached as Appendix I to this document. We
encourage you to read it in its entirety because it is the legal document
governing the merger.

Merger Expected to Occur in First or Second Calendar Quarter of 2003 (page 31)

      The merger will occur only after all of the conditions to its completion
have been satisfied or waived. Currently, we anticipate that the merger will be
consummated in the first or second calendar quarter of 2003.

Conditions That Must Be Satisfied or Waived for the Merger to Occur (page 32)

      The completion of the merger depends on a number of conditions being
satisfied or waived, including receipt of stockholder and regulatory approvals
and tax opinions. These conditions are more fully described herein and in the
merger agreement.

      We cannot be certain when, or if, the conditions to the merger will be
satisfied or waived, or that the merger will be completed.

Termination of the Merger Agreement (page 33)

      We may agree to terminate the merger agreement before completing the
merger, even after adoption of the merger agreement by Marked Tree Bancshares
stockholders, as long as the termination is approved by each of our boards of
directors. Also, either of Pocahontas Bancorp or Marked Tree Bancshares may
decide to terminate the merger agreement if the Marked Tree Bancshares
stockholders fail to approve the merger.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      In addition, either of Pocahontas Bancorp or Marked Tree Bancshares may
decide to terminate the merger agreement, even after adoption of the merger
agreement by Marked Tree Bancshares stockholders, if certain conditions in the
merger agreement have not been met, such as obtaining the necessary regulatory
approvals, or the other party's material breach of a representation or warranty
in the merger agreement.

      Finally, either of Pocahontas Bancorp or Marked Tree Bancshares may
terminate the merger agreement if the merger is not completed by July 31, 2003.

Certain Marked Tree Bancshares' Directors and Officers Have Financial
Interests in the Merger (page 29)

      Certain Marked Tree Bancshares' directors and officers have interests in
the merger as individuals in addition to, or different from, their interests as
stockholders. The Marked Tree Bancshares board of directors was aware of these
interests of Marked Tree Bancshares directors and officers and considered them
in its decision to approve the merger agreement. These interests include the
right to continued indemnification and insurance coverage by Pocahontas Bancorp
for acts or omissions occurring prior to the merger. In addition, certain
members of the Marked Tree Bancshares board of directors and management will be
appointed to the board of directors of First Community Bank.

Board of Directors and Management of Pocahontas Bancorp Following the Merger
(page 26)

      Upon completion of the merger, the board of directors and management of
Pocahontas Bancorp will consist of the same individuals currently serving in
those positions. The board of directors of First Community Bank will be expanded
by two members and Pocahontas Bancorp and Marked Tree Bancshares have mutually
agreed on the persons to be appointed to that board. Accounting Treatment of the
Merger by Pocahontas Bancorp (page 34)

      Pocahontas Bancorp will account for the merger as a purchase for financial
reporting purposes.

The Rights of Marked Tree Bancshares Stockholders will be Governed by New
Governing Documents after the Merger (page 37)

      If the merger is completed, your rights as a stockholder will no longer be
governed by Marked Tree Bancshares' articles of incorporation and bylaws.
Instead, you will automatically become a stockholder of Pocahontas Bancorp and
your rights will be governed by Pocahontas Bancorp's certificate of
incorporation and bylaws. This document contains descriptions of the stockholder
rights under each of the Pocahontas Bancorp and Marked Tree Bancshares governing
documents, and describes the material differences between them.

Marked Tree Bancshares Has Agreed to Pay a Termination Fee to Pocahontas
Bancorp under Certain Circumstances (page 32)

      Marked Tree Bancshares will pay Pocahontas Bancorp a termination fee of
$115,000 if the merger agreement is terminated after an acquisition proposal
with respect to Marked Tree Bancshares is commenced, publicly proposed or
publicly disclosed, and within 18 months after termination of the merger
agreement, Marked Tree Bancshares enters into an agreement related to the
acquisition proposal. The termination fee could have the effect of discouraging
other companies from trying to acquire Marked Tree Bancshares.

Regulatory Approvals We Must Obtain for the Merger (page 32)

      We cannot complete the merger unless we obtain the approval of the Office
of Thrift Supervision. We made the necessary filings with the Office of Thrift
Supervision on January __, 2003 and we expect regulatory approval of the merger
in March 2003. Under federal law, following approval by the Office of Thrift
Supervision, the United States Department of Justice may file objections to the
merger under the federal anti-trust laws. Although we do not know of any reason
why we cannot obtain approval of the Office of Thrift Supervision or
nonobjection from the Department of Justice, we cannot be certain when and if we
will obtain them.

The Bank Merger (page 23)

      In the merger, Marked Tree Bancshares will merge with and into Pocahontas
Bancorp, with Pocahontas Bancorp as the surviving corporation. Pocahontas
Bancorp, the surviving corporation, will continue to be called "Pocahontas
Bancorp, Inc."

Immediately after the merger is completed, Marked Tree Bank will be merged with
First Community Bank, with First Community Bank as the surviving institution.

Marked Tree Bancshares will Hold its Special Meeting on March __, 2003 (page 18)

      The Marked Tree Bancshares special meeting will be held on March __, 2003,
at __:__ _.m., Central time, at the office of Marked Tree Bank, 210 Frisco
Street, Marked Tree, Arkansas. At the Marked Tree Bancshares special meeting,
you will be asked:

      1.    To adopt the merger agreement; and

      2.    To act on such other matters as may be properly brought before the
            Marked Tree Bancshares special meeting.

      Record Date. You may cast one vote at the Marked Tree Bancshares special
meeting for each share of Marked Tree Bancshares common stock that you owned at
the close of business on February __, 2003. At that date, there were 2,794.145
shares of Marked Tree Bancshares common stock entitled to be voted at the
special meeting.

      Required Vote. To adopt the merger agreement, the holders of at least
two-thirds of the outstanding shares of Marked Tree Bancshares common stock must
vote in favor of the merger agreement. Because approval is based on the
affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of shares outstanding, a Marked Tree
Bancshares stockholder's failure to vote or an abstention will have the same
effect as a vote against the merger.

      As of the record date, directors and executive officers of Marked Tree
Bancshares and their affiliates beneficially owned or had the right to vote
2,794.145 shares of Marked Tree Bancshares common stock, or 100% of the
outstanding Marked Tree Bancshares common stock entitled to be voted at the
special meeting.

Expenses

      Marked Tree Bancshares and Pocahontas Bancorp will bear and pay the costs
and expenses incurred by each of them in connection with the merger. If the
merger agreement is terminated by one of them based on a breach of a
representation, warranty or covenant in the merger agreement by the other of
them, which breach would result in a material adverse effect, the breaching
entity will pay to the nonbreaching entity all out-of-pocket costs and expenses,
including reasonable legal and accounting fees and expenses, incurred by the
nonbreaching entity in connection with the merger.

                                 RISK FACTORS

Risks Related to the Merger

      Pocahontas Bancorp may not be able to successfully integrate acquired
businesses.

      There is a risk that Pocahontas Bancorp will be unable to integrate
successfully Marked Tree Bancshares and other acquired businesses or may have
more trouble integrating acquired businesses than expected. In May 2001, May
2002 and June 2002, Pocahontas Bancorp acquired Walden/Smith Financial Group,
Inc. and its subsidiary, First Community Bank ($152.2 million in assets);
Peoples Bank of Imboden ($71.6 million in assets); and North Arkansas
Bancshares, Inc. and its subsidiary, Newport Federal Savings Bank ($37.0 million
in assets), respectively.

      Pocahontas Bancorp may not be able to maintain key customers, integrate
critical systems, or realize cost savings.

      There is a risk that Pocahontas Bancorp will be unable to maintain key
customers of Marked Tree Bancshares and that the conversion of its systems and
procedures to Pocahontas Bancorp's systems and procedures may not be possible or
completed on schedule or may be more difficult and costly than expected, which
could cause the acquired operations to perform below expectations. Finally,
although Pocahontas Bancorp anticipates cost savings as a result of the merger,
Pocahontas Bancorp may be unable to fully realize expected cost savings, and any
cost savings that are realized may be offset by losses in revenues or charges to
earnings.

Risks Related to Pocahontas Bancorp and Marked Tree Bancshares

      Changes in Pocahontas Bancorp's allowance for loan losses could affect
Pocahontas Bancorp's profitability.

      In originating loans, there is a substantial likelihood that credit losses
will be experienced. The risk of loss varies with, among other things, general
economic conditions, the type of loan being made, the creditworthiness of the
borrower over the term of the loan and, in the case of a collateralized loan,
the quality of the collateral for the loan. Pocahontas Bancorp's management
maintains an allowance for loan losses based on, among other things, historical
experience, an evaluation of economic conditions and regular reviews of
delinquencies and loan portfolio quality. Based upon these factors, management
makes various assumptions and judgments about the ultimate chance of collection
of Pocahontas Bancorp's loan portfolio and provides an allowance for potential
loan losses based upon a percentage of the outstanding balances and for specific
loans when their ultimate chance of being collected is considered questionable.
Because certain lending activities involve greater risks, the percentage applied
to specific loan types may vary.

      As of September 30, 2002, Pocahontas Bancorp's allowance for loan losses
was $3.3 million, which represented 0.8% of total loans receivable. As of
September 30, 2002, non-performing loans were $3.2 million and total
non-performing assets were $4.9 million. The allowance for loan losses provided
coverage of 103.2% of total non-performing loans and 67.2% of total
non-performing assets. Pocahontas Bancorp actively manages its non-performing
loans in an effort to minimize credit losses and monitors its asset quality to
maintain an adequate loan loss allowance. Although management believes that its
allowance for loan losses is adequate, there can be no assurance that the
allowance will prove sufficient to cover future loan losses. Further, although
management uses the best information available to make determinations with
respect to the allowance for loan losses, future adjustments may be necessary if
economic conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used or adverse
developments arise with respect to Pocahontas Bancorp's loans. Material
additions to Pocahontas Bancorp's allowance for loan losses would result in a
decrease in Pocahontas Bancorp's net income and, possibly, its capital and could
result in its inability to pay dividends, among other adverse consequences.

      The trading volume in Pocahontas Bancorp stock has been low.

      The trading volume in Pocahontas Bancorp stock on the NASDAQ National
Market has been relatively low when compared with larger companies listed on the
NASDAQ National Market or the stock exchanges. We cannot say with any certainty
that a more active and liquid trading market for Pocahontas Bancorp stock will
develop. Because of this, it may be more difficult for you to sell a substantial
number of shares for the same price at which you could sell a smaller number of
shares.

      Changes in interest rates could have an adverse effect on Pocahontas
Bancorp's income.

      The combined company's profitability will depend to a large extent upon
its net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest
income on interest-earning assets, such as loans and investments, and interest
expense on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings.
Pocahontas Bancorp's net interest income will be adversely affected if market
interest rates change such that the interest the combined company has to pay on
deposits and borrowings increases faster than the interest it earns on loans and
investments.

      Competition in the banking industry is intense.

      Competition in the banking and financial services industry is intense. In
its primary market areas, Pocahontas Bancorp's subsidiary bank competes with
commercial banks, other savings and loan associations, credit unions, finance
companies, mutual funds, insurance companies and brokerage and investment
banking firms operating locally and elsewhere. Many of these competitors have
substantially greater resources and lending limits than Pocahontas Bancorp's
subsidiary bank and may offer certain services that Pocahontas Bancorp's
subsidiary bank does not or cannot provide. The profitability of Pocahontas
Bancorp depends upon its subsidiary bank's continued ability to compete in its
market area.

      Success of Pocahontas Bancorp depends upon local economic conditions.

      Pocahontas Bancorp's success is dependent to a certain extent upon the
general economic conditions in the geographic markets served by Pocahontas
Bancorp's subsidiary bank, primarily Northeastern Arkansas. Pocahontas Bancorp
cannot assure you that favorable economic development will occur or that
Pocahontas Bancorp's expectation of corresponding growth will be achieved.
Adverse changes in the geographic markets that Pocahontas Bancorp's subsidiary
bank serves would likely impair its ability to collect loans and could otherwise
have a negative effect on the financial condition of Pocahontas Bancorp.
Examples of potential unfavorable changes in economic conditions that could
affect Northeastern Arkansas include, among other things, the adverse effects of
weather on agricultural production and a substantial decline in agricultural
commodity prices.

      Pocahontas Bancorp and its subsidiary bank operate in a regulated
environment.

      Savings and loan holding companies and savings banks operate in a highly
regulated environment and are subject to the supervision and examination by
federal regulatory agencies. Pocahontas Bancorp and its subsidiary bank are
subject to regulation and supervision by the Office of Thrift Supervision and
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Federal laws and regulations govern
matters ranging from the maintenance of adequate capital for the general
business operations and financial condition of Pocahontas Bancorp's subsidiary
bank, including permissible types, amounts and terms of loans and investments,
the amount of reserves against deposits, restrictions on dividends,
establishment of branch offices, and the maximum rate of interest that may be
charged by law. These and other restrictions limit the manner by which
Pocahontas Bancorp and its subsidiary bank may conduct their businesses and
obtain financing. Furthermore, the banking business is affected not only by
general economic conditions but also by the monetary policies of the Federal
Reserve. These monetary policies have had, and are expected to continue to have,
significant effects on the operating results of financial institutions. Changes
in monetary or legislative policies may affect the ability of Pocahontas
Bancorp's subsidiary bank to attract deposits and make loans.


                                       7
<PAGE>

      Pocahontas Bancorp is affected by bank reform legislation.

      In November 1999, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Financial Services Modernization
Act of 1999 was enacted. The Act is intended to modernize the financial services
industry by establishing a comprehensive framework to permit affiliations among
commercial banks, insurance companies, securities firms and other financial
service providers. Since the Act now permits banks, securities firms and
insurance companies to affiliate, the financial services industry may experience
further consolidation. This could result in the establishment and proliferation
in Pocahontas Bancorp's market area of a number of larger financial institutions
and other corporations that offer a wider variety of financial services than
Pocahontas Bancorp currently offers and that can aggressively compete in the
markets Pocahontas Bancorp currently serves, which could hurt Pocahontas
Bancorp's profitability.

      Pocahontas Bancorp directors and executive officers own a significant
portion of Pocahontas Bancorp common stock.

      Pocahontas Bancorp's directors and executive officers, as a group,
beneficially owned approximately 23.4% of the outstanding Pocahontas Bancorp
common stock as of January 28, 2003. There are no agreements or understandings
between or among any of Pocahontas Bancorp's directors or executive officers to
vote their Pocahontas Bancorp common stock. As a result of their ownership,
however, the directors and executive officers will have the ability, by voting
their shares in concert, to influence significantly the outcome of all matters
submitted to Pocahontas Bancorp's stockholders for approval, including the
election of directors.

      Marked Tree Bancshares stockholders will own a small percentage of
Pocahontas Bancorp's outstanding common stock after the merger.

      Marked Tree Bancshares stockholders collectively own 100% of Marked Tree
Bancshares and, in the aggregate, have the absolute power to approve or reject
any matters requiring the approval of stockholders under Arkansas law and Marked
Tree Bancshares' articles of incorporation. After the merger, however, Marked
Tree Bancshares' stockholders will own in the aggregate approximately 6.3% of
the outstanding shares of Pocahontas Bancorp common stock (assuming an exchange
ratio of 103.86). Even if all former Marked Tree Bancshares stockholders vote in
concert on all matters presented to Pocahontas Bancorp stockholders from time to
time, this number of shares may not have a material effect on whether matters
submitted to Pocahontas Bancorp stockholders are ultimately approved or
rejected.

      Future sales of Pocahontas Bancorp common stock can affect its price.

      Pocahontas Bancorp cannot predict the effect, if any, that future sales of
outstanding Pocahontas Bancorp common stock or the availability of Pocahontas
Bancorp common stock for sale will have on its market price from time to time.
Sales of substantial amounts of Pocahontas Bancorp common stock in the public
market following the merger, or the perception that such sales could occur,
could adversely affect prevailing market prices of Pocahontas Bancorp common
stock.

      Pocahontas Bancorp's quarterly operating results may fluctuate.

      Pocahontas Bancorp's quarterly operating results have varied in the past
and are expected to do so in the future. As changes occur in outside market
forces, such as interest rates, the general economy and the agricultural
industry in the southeastern United States, the regulation of the financial
services industry and other similar forces, Pocahontas Bancorp's future
quarterly operating results may vary significantly. In response to competitive
pressures or new product or service introductions, Pocahontas Bancorp may take
certain pricing or marketing actions that could adversely affect Pocahontas
Bancorp's quarterly operating results. Pocahontas Bancorp's expense levels are
based, in part, on Pocahontas Bancorp's expectations as to margins and fee
revenues from its subsidiary bank's customers. If such margins and fees are
below expectations, then Pocahontas Bancorp may be unable to adjust spending
sufficiently in a timely manner to compensate for the unexpected shortfall. In
future quarters, Pocahontas Bancorp's operating results may be below the
expectations of public market analysts and investors. In such event, the price
of Pocahontas Bancorp common stock would likely fall.

      Pocahontas Bancorp's acquisitions could be dilutive to ownership
percentages.

      Pocahontas Bancorp has grown recently through acquisitions. From time to
time, Pocahontas Bancorp evaluates strategic opportunities in the banking and
related financial services industries, and could make material acquisitions in
the future. Pocahontas Bancorp may issue common stock to pay for those future
acquisitions which could dilute the ownership interest of all Pocahontas Bancorp
stockholders at the time of any such acquisition.

                      COMPARATIVE PER COMMON SHARE DATA

      The following table shows information about income per common share,
dividends per share and book value per share, and similar information reflecting
the merger (which we refer to as "pro forma" information). In presenting the
comparative pro forma information for certain time periods, we assumed that we
had merged at the beginning of the periods presented. We also assumed that
Marked Tree Bancshares will be merged with Pocahontas Bancorp using the purchase
method of accounting. See "ACCOUNTING TREATMENT" on page 34.

      The information listed as "pro forma equivalent" was obtained by
multiplying the pro forma amounts by an exchange ratio of 103.86. We present
this information to reflect the fact that Marked Tree Bancshares stockholders
will receive shares of Pocahontas Bancorp common stock for each share of Marked
Tree Bancshares common stock exchanged in the merger. Because the exchange ratio
is subject to adjustments if the average of the closing prices of Pocahontas
Bancorp common stock over a specified period shortly before closing exceeds
certain limits, the actual exchange ratio may be more or less than 103.86. We
also anticipate that the combined company will derive financial benefits from
the merger that include reduced operating expenses and the opportunity to earn
more revenue. The pro forma information, while helpful in illustrating the
financial characteristics of the new company under one set of assumptions, does
not reflect these benefits and, accordingly, does not attempt to predict or
suggest future results. The pro forma information also does not necessarily
reflect what the historical results of the combined company would have been had
our companies been combined during these periods.

      Pocahontas Bancorp's fiscal year ends September 30 and Marked Tree
Bancshares' fiscal year ends December 31. In the following tables, financial
data for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002 includes Marked Tree
Bancshares' financial data for the 12 months ended September 30, 2002 and
information regarding Pocahontas Bancorp is presented consistent with the fiscal
year of Pocahontas Bancorp ended September 30, 2002. The information for the
three months ended December 31, 2002 is based on the respective historical
unaudited financial statements of Pocahontas Bancorp and Marked Tree Bancshares.
All adjustments necessary to arrive at a fair presentation of interim period
data have been included and are of a normal and recurring nature.

      The information in the following table is based on, and should be read
together with, the historical financial information that we have presented in
this document. Pocahontas Bancorp has incorporated its prior filings into this
document by reference. See "Where You Can Find More Information" on page 44.

(1)   Pro forma amounts are calculated based upon the assumption that all of the
      issued and outstanding shares of Marked Tree Bancshares common stock
      (other than treasury stock) are converted into shares of Pocahontas
      Bancorp common stock assuming an exchange ratio of 103.86 and that no cash
      is paid for fractional shares.
(2)   The equivalent pro forma amounts are calculated by multiplying the pro
      forma combined amounts by the assumed exchange ratio of 103.86.
(3)   Pro forma dividend amounts assume that Pocahontas Bancorp would have
      declared a cash dividend per common share at an annual rate equal to $0.32
      per share, in accordance with Pocahontas Bancorp's current dividend
      policy.
(4)   Includes estimated pro forma impact of amortizing core deposit intangible,
      which results in a $61,000 annual reduction in earnings.

(1)   With the exception of period end ratios, ratios are based on average
      monthly balances.
(2)   Interest rate spread represents the difference between the weighted
      average yield on average interest earning assets and the weighted average
      cost of average interest bearing liabilities, and net interest margin
      represents net interest income as a percent of average interest earning
      assets.
(3)   End of period ratio.
(4)   Nonperforming assets consist of nonperforming loans and real estate owned.
      Nonperforming loans consist of non-accrual loans while real estate owned
      consists of real estate acquired in settlement of loans.
(5)   The efficiency ratio is the ratio of noninterest expense to the sum of net
      interest income and noninterest income.
(6)   This calculation is based on 4,376,295, 4,468,680, 4,454,357, 5,518,614,
      and 6,399,623 shares outstanding at September 30, 2002 and 2001, 2000,
      1999 and 1998, respectively.

          CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

      This document contains a number of forward-looking statements regarding
the financial condition, results of operations and business of Pocahontas
Bancorp and Marked Tree Bancshares. These statements may be made directly in
this document or may be incorporated in this document by reference to other
documents and may include statements for the period following the completion of
the merger. You can find many of these statements by looking for words such as
"believes," "expects," "anticipates," "estimates," "potential" or similar
expressions. Some of the factors that may cause actual results to differ
materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements include,
but are not limited to, the following:

      o     increases in competitive pressure among financial institutions or
            from non-financial institutions;

      o     changes in the interest rate environment;

      o     changes in deposit flows, loan demand or real estate values;

      o     changes in accounting principles, policies or guidelines;

      o     general economic conditions, either nationally or in some or all of
            the operating areas in which the combined company will be doing
            business, or conditions in securities markets, or the banking
            industry;

      o     legislation or regulatory changes;

      o     technological changes;

      o     the level of realization, if any, of expected cost savings from the
            merger;

      o     difficulties related to the integration of the business of
            Pocahontas Bancorp and Marked Tree Bancshares may be greater than
            expected; and

      o     revenues following the merger may be lower than expected.

      Because such forward-looking statements are subject to assumptions and
uncertainties, actual results may differ materially from those expressed or
implied by such forward-looking statements. You are cautioned not to place undue
reliance on such statements, which speak only as of the date of this document or
the date of any document incorporated by reference.

      All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements concerning the
merger or other matters addressed in this document and attributable to
Pocahontas Bancorp or Marked Tree Bancshares or any person acting on their
behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements
contained or referred to in this section. Except to the extent required by
applicable law or regulation, neither Pocahontas Bancorp nor Marked Tree
Bancshares undertakes any obligation to release publicly any revisions to such
forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of
this document or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. However,
each of Pocahontas Bancorp and Marked Tree Bancshares will promptly amend or
supplement this document in order to reflect any facts or events of which it
becomes aware arising after the effective date of this document and prior to the
date of the Marked Tree Bancshares special meeting which individually or in the
aggregate represent a fundamental change in the information set forth herein.

                  THE MARKED TREE BANCSHARES SPECIAL MEETING

      This section contains information from Marked Tree Bancshares about the
special meeting of stockholders it has called to consider and approve the merger
agreement.

      Together with this document, we are also sending you a notice of the
Marked Tree Bancshares special meeting and a form of proxy that is solicited by
our board of directors. The special meeting will be held on March __, 2003 at
__:__ _.m., Central time, at the office of Marked Tree Bank, 210 Frisco Street,
Marked Tree, Arkansas.

Matters to be Considered

      The purpose of the special meeting is to vote on a proposal for adoption
of the merger agreement.

      You may be asked to vote upon any other matters that may properly be
submitted to a vote at the special meeting. You also may be asked to vote upon a
proposal to adjourn the special meeting. We could use any adjournment for the
purpose, among others, of allowing additional time to solicit proxies.

Proxies

      Each copy of this document mailed to Marked Tree Bancshares stockholders
is accompanied by a form of proxy with voting instructions for submission by
mail. You should complete and return the proxy card accompanying this document
to ensure that your vote is counted at the special meeting, or any adjournment
thereof, regardless of whether you plan to attend the special meeting. You can
revoke your proxy at any time before the vote is taken at the special meeting by

      o     submitting written notice of revocation to the Secretary of Marked
            Tree Bancshares prior to the voting of such proxy,

      o     submitting a properly executed later-dated proxy, or

      o     voting in person at the special meeting; however, simply attending
            the special meeting without voting will not revoke an earlier proxy.

Written notices of revocation and other communications about revoking your proxy
should be addressed to:

              Marked Tree Bancshares, Inc.
              210 Frisco Street
              Marked Tree, Arkansas 72365
              Attention: E. Ritter Arnold, President and Chief Executive Officer

      All shares represented by valid proxies we receive through this
solicitation, and not revoked, will be voted in accordance with your
instructions on the proxy card. If you make no specification on your proxy card
as to how you want your shares voted before signing and returning it, your proxy
will be voted "FOR" adoption of the merger agreement. The Marked Tree Bancshares
board of directors is presently unaware of any other matters that may be
presented for action at the special meeting. If other matters do properly come
before the special meeting, or any adjournment thereof, we intend that shares
represented by properly submitted proxies will be voted, or not voted, by and at
the discretion of the persons named as proxies on the proxy card. However,
proxies that indicate a vote against adoption of the merger agreement will not
be voted in favor of adjourning the special meeting to solicit additional
proxies.

      You should NOT send stock certificates with your proxy cards. If the
merger is completed, you will be mailed a transmittal form promptly after the
completion of the merger with instructions on how to exchange your stock
certificates for stock certificates of Pocahontas Bancorp and cash in lieu of
fractional shares, if applicable.

Solicitation of Proxies

      Marked Tree Bancshares will bear the entire cost of soliciting proxies
from you. If necessary, we may use several of our regular employees, who will
not be specially compensated, to solicit proxies from Marked Tree Bancshares
stockholders, either personally or by telephone, telegram, facsimile or letter.

Record Date

      Your board of directors has fixed the close of business on February __,
2003 as the record date for determining the Marked Tree Bancshares stockholders
entitled to receive notice of and to vote at the special meeting. At that date,
2,794.145 shares of Marked Tree Bancshares common stock were outstanding, held
by 13 holders of record.

Voting Rights and Vote Required

      The presence, in person or by properly executed proxy, of the holders of a
majority of the outstanding shares of Marked Tree Bancshares common stock is
necessary to constitute a quorum at the special meeting. Abstentions will be
counted for the purpose of determining whether a quorum is present.

      Adoption of the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote at the
special meeting of the holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares
of Marked Tree Bancshares common stock. You are entitled to one vote for each
share of Marked Tree Bancshares common stock you held as of the record date. A
person or entity is deemed to beneficially own shares that are owned by an
affiliate as well as by any person acting in concert with such person or entity.

      Because the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the
outstanding shares of Marked Tree Bancshares common stock at the special meeting
is needed for us to proceed with the merger, the failure to vote by proxy or in
person will have the same effect as a vote against the merger agreement.
Abstentions also will have the same effect as a vote against the merger.
Accordingly, your board of directors urges you to complete, date, and sign the
accompanying proxy card and return it promptly in the enclosed postage-paid
envelope.

Principal Holders of Voting Securities

      The following table sets forth, as of the record date, the shares of
Marked Tree Bancshares common stock beneficially owned by directors and
executive officers individually, by executive officers and directors as a group
and by each person who was the beneficial owner of more than five percent of the
outstanding shares of Marked Tree Bancshares common stock on the record date.

                                  THE MERGER

      The following discussion contains material information pertaining to the
merger. This discussion is subject, and qualified in its entirety by reference,
to the merger agreement attached as an Appendix to this document. We encourage
you to read and review that document as well as the discussion in this document.

General

      This section provides material information about the merger of Marked Tree
Bancshares and Pocahontas Bancorp and the circumstances surrounding the merger.
The next section of this document, entitled "THE MERGER AGREEMENT" on pages 30
through 34, have additional and more detailed information regarding the legal
documents that govern the merger, including information about the conditions to
completion of the merger and the provisions for terminating or amending the
merger agreement.

      At the special meeting, you will be asked to consider and vote upon a
proposal to adopt the merger agreement. Adoption of the merger agreement will
constitute adoption of the transactions it contemplates, including, among
others, the merger of Marked Tree Bancshares with and into Pocahontas Bancorp.

      We are furnishing this document to you in connection with the solicitation
of proxies by the board of directors of Marked Tree Bancshares for use at its
special meeting of stockholders and any adjournment of the meeting.

Conversion of Marked Tree Bancshares Common Stock

      When the merger becomes effective, for each share of Marked Tree
Bancshares common stock that you own, you will receive the number of shares of
Pocahontas Bancorp common stock determined by dividing the stated book value per
share of Marked Tree Bancshares by the stated book value per share of Pocahontas
Bancorp. Stated book value per share will be calculated as of the last calendar
quarter-end prior to the consummation of the merger. For example, assuming the
merger was to be consummated before March 31, 2003, the stated book value per
share would be calculated as of December 31, 2002. As of that date, the stated
book value per share of Pocahontas Bancorp was $11.10 and the stated book value
per share of Marked Tree Bancshares was $1,152.82; accordingly, the number of
shares of Pocahontas Bancorp common stock that you would receive for each share
of Marked Tree Bancshares that you own would be 103.86 (determined by dividing
$1,152.82 by $11.10).

      The exchange ratio, determined as provided above, is subject to
adjustment. If the average of the closing prices of Pocahontas Bancorp common
stock on the NASDAQ National Market for the 20 consecutive trading days ending
on the fifth business day before the merger is consummated is more than 15%
higher or more than 15% lower than $10.35, then the exchange ratio will be
decreased by the percentage by which that average market value is higher than
$10.35 or increased by the percentage by which that market value is lower than
$10.35, respectively. Pocahontas Bancorp will not issue any fractional shares.
Instead, you will receive a cash payment, without interest, equal to that
fractional share interest.

      Any shares of Marked Tree Bancshares common stock owned or held by
Pocahontas Bancorp or Marked Tree Bancshares or any of their subsidiaries at the
time the merger becomes effective will cease to exist, and those shares will not
be converted into shares of Pocahontas Bancorp common stock. No shares of
Pocahontas Bancorp capital stock or cash will be issued or exchanged for such
shares.

      Stockholders of Marked Tree Bancshares have the right to dissent from the
merger and obtain the payment of the fair value of their shares. To do so
however, stockholders must satisfy specific statutory requirements. See
"Dissenters' Rights" and Appendix II for a description of these procedures. Any
dissenting shares will not be converted in the merger into Pocahontas Bancorp
common stock.

Structure of the Merger

      The merger agreement provides for the merger of Marked Tree Bancshares
with and into Pocahontas Bancorp. Pocahontas Bancorp will be the surviving
corporation. Immediately after the consummation of the merger, First Community
Bank (Pocahontas Bancorp's savings bank subsidiary) and Marked Tree Bank (Marked
Tree Bancshares' bank subsidiary) will merge, with First Community Bank the
surviving bank of that merger.

      Pocahontas Bancorp will account for the merger as a "purchase" for
financial reporting purposes. The merger is intended to qualify as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue
Code for federal income tax purposes.

Background of the Merger

      Prior to 1999, Marked Tree Bank had primarily served as a lender to
individuals, small businesses and farming entities in the 15-mile radius of
Marked Tree, Arkansas and a significant portion of Marked Tree Bank's loan
portfolio was concentrated in agricultural lending. During early spring of 1999,
Marked Tree Bank identified a number of agricultural loans that were
non-performing, which resulted in Marked Tree Bank having to make substantial
additions to its loan loss reserve, incur substantial loan charge-offs
(primarily related to agricultural loans), and incur material losses. In May
1999, Marked Tree Bank engaged a new President and Chief Executive Officer,
Frankie L. Pratt, who had extensive experience in problem loan workout and
collection matters for small banks.

      As a result of these problems, Marked Tree Bank entered into a Memorandum
of Understanding dated June 30, 1999 with the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation and the Arkansas State Banking Department, and Marked Tree
Bancshares entered into a similar Memorandum of Understanding in October 1999
with the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis and the Arkansas State Banking
Department. As a part of these regulatory agreements, Marked Tree Bancshares
raised new equity and borrowed funds which were used in October 1999 to
contribute additional capital to Marked Tree Bank. As a result of this equity
infusion, improvements in the loan portfolio, and other actions taken by Bank
management, the two Memoranda of Understanding were terminated by the respective
regulators in the second quarter of 2000. During 1999, 2000, and the first half
of 2001, Marked Tree Bank continued to deal with its workout and problem loan
issues, and Bank management limited asset growth. Loan growth was largely
generated by purchasing loan participations from banks in Arkansas and Tennessee
with which Bank management were familiar. Between the end of 1998 and the end of
2001, Marked Tree Bank's assets were reduced from $36.8 million to $30.1
million.

      In July 2001, Mr. Pratt resigned as President and Chief Executive Officer
to take a position with another financial institution, and was not replaced. In
October 2001, Bank management took into income approximately $619,000,
representing a reverse provision from its loan loss reserve. By the end of 2001,
Marked Tree Bank had been restored to financial health and a more normal
operating environment. However, the Board found it difficult to generate a
reasonable volume of quality loans in Marked Tree Bank's market area,
particularly in light of Marked Tree Bank's more restricted agricultural
lending. Further, Marked Tree Bank's board of directors was aware of the ongoing
changes in the financial services industry, including increased competition and
consolidation.

      Marked Tree Bank's board of directors believed that in order to remain
independent it would be necessary for Marked Tree Bank to increase its assets
and operations, which would involve increases in expenses for personnel and
technology, new products and additional capital. In view of the board's belief
that continued consolidation and competition in the financial services industry
would make it increasingly difficult for rural community banks such as Marked
Tree Bank to maintain a competitive position and market share, the board
determined it would be appropriate to consider various strategic alternatives,
including remaining an independent entity, as well as entering into possible
business combinations with other financial institutions.

      Two northeast Arkansas community banks had expressed a possible interest
in a business combination with Marked Tree Bank, and representatives of Marked
Tree Bank's board of directors had exploratory discussions with representatives
of these two institutions from late 2001 through the first quarter of 2002. Bank
management engaged legal counsel experienced with bank merger transactions in
the fourth quarter of 2001. In addition, Marked Tree Bank's board of directors
engaged Mercer Capital Management, Inc. of Memphis, Tennessee in the first


                                       23
<PAGE>

quarter of 2002 to assist it in an analysis of the factors involved in valuing
the common stock of Marked Tree Bancshares, as well as similar valuation
analyses of potential merger partners. One of the potential interested parties
determined by January 2002 that its board was not interested in a merger
transaction at that time. Marked Tree Bank had several discussions with the
remaining interested party, but no specific price or terms were agreed upon, and
by April 2002, those discussions were terminated when the other party determined
that other business initiatives would not allow it to pursue a merger
transaction with Marked Tree Bank during 2002.

      In March 2002, a representative of First Community Bank approached one of
the directors of Marked Tree Bancshares to determine if there would be any
interest in discussing the possibility of a business combination with Pocahontas
Bancorp, Inc. In June 2002, representatives of Marked Tree Bank's board of
directors met with Dwayne Powell, President and Chief Executive Officer of
Pocahontas Bancorp, and Harold Perrin, a director of First Community Bank, about
the possibility of a merger between the two institutions. Mr. Powell indicated
an interest on behalf of Pocahontas Bancorp, and after two further exploratory
meetings between representatives of the two institutions, the parties entered
into a Confidentiality Agreement on July 29, 2002, and exchanged financial and
other information. Representatives of the parties had additional meetings in
August and September of 2002. On September 24, 2002, Mr. Powell submitted to
Marked Tree Bank's representatives a draft letter of intent which outlined
proposed terms of a merger between the parties and certain related items. Based
on the board's knowledge of the likely acquirers for rural community banks in
the Marked Tree area, the board did not believe that there were likely to be
other interested or suitable parties. Bank management and its legal counsel
reviewed and discussed the draft letter of intent and on September 26, 2002,
submitted certain changes and additions to that letter. On October 1, 2002 Mr.
Powell submitted a revised letter of intent, and this revised letter of intent
was considered and discussed in detail by the board of directors and certain
stockholders of Marked Tree Bancshares. On October 3, 2002, the board of
directors of Marked Tree Bancshares approved the terms of the letter of intent
and authorized the board's representatives to sign such letter and to issue a
press release related to such proposed transaction. On October __ 2002, the
board of directors of Pocahontas Bancorp approved the letter of intent, and the
letter of intent was signed, effective October 3, 2002, by both parties. On
October 9, 2002, a public announcement of the proposed transaction was issued by
both parties.

      In late October 2002, Pocahontas Bancorp and its counsel submitted a draft
of a proposed merger agreement between the parties. Over the ensuing two weeks,
Marked Tree Bancshares and its counsel reviewed the merger agreement, provided
comments, and these comments were incorporated by Pocahontas Bancorp into new
drafts of a definitive merger agreement, the final draft of which was submitted
to the board of directors of Marked Tree Bancshares at a special meeting on
November 26, 2002. Counsel for Marked Tree Bancshares participated in this
meeting by conference call. The board and its counsel reviewed the terms of the
final merger agreement and discussed the changes that had been made during
negotiations. After discussion and questions and answers, the board of directors
of Marked Tree Bancshares approved the definitive merger agreement by written
consent action as of November 26, 2002. On November 20, 2002, the Pocahontas
Bancorp board met and approved the terms of the definitive merger agreement,
subject to satisfactory resolution by management of several final issues. The
final merger agreement was executed on November 27, 2002 and a press release
announcing the execution of the merger agreement was issued later that day.

Reasons for the Merger and Recommendation of the Marked Tree Bancshares Board
of Directors

      Marked Tree Bancshares board believes that the merger is fair to, and in
the best interests of, Marked Tree Bancshares and its stockholders. Accordingly,
the Marked Tree Bancshares board has unanimously approved the merger agreement
and recommends that the holders of Marked Tree Bancshares common stock vote FOR
the approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

      The terms of the merger, including the exchange ratio, are the result of
arm's-length negotiations between representatives of Marked Tree Bancshares and
Pocahontas Bancorp. In reaching its decision to approve the merger agreement,
the Marked Tree Bancshares board consulted with its legal advisor regarding the
legal terms of the transaction and the board's obligations in its consideration
of the proposed transaction. The board considered a number of factors, both from
a short-term and long-term perspective, including the following:


                                       24
<PAGE>

      o     the board's familiarity with and review of Marked Tree Bancshares'
            business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects,
            including its potential growth and profitability and the associated
            business risks;

      o     the current and prospective environment in which Marked Tree
            Bancshares operates, including national and local economic
            conditions, the competitive environment for rural community banks
            and other financial institutions generally, and the increasing
            consolidation in the financial services industry and the competitive
            effects of such increased consolidation on smaller financial
            institutions such as Marked Tree Bank;

      o     the rapid technological advances impacting the financial services
            industry in recent years, the capital investment necessary for
            Marked Tree Bank to keep pace with such technological advances, the
            competitive advantage and increased efficiency gained by financial
            institutions possessing sufficient resources to enable them to make
            such capital investments and to realize such efficiencies, and the
            comparable competitive disadvantage to smaller institutions such as
            Marked Tree Bank which generally do not possess the resources
            necessary to invest in such technological advances;

      o     information concerning the business, financial condition, results of
            operations and prospects of First Community Bank, including the
            recent performance of Pocahontas Bancorp common stock, the
            historical financial data of Pocahontas Bancorp, customary
            statistical measurements of Pocahontas Bancorp's financial
            performance and the future prospects for Pocahontas Bancorp common
            stock following the merger;

      o     the value to be received by holders of Marked Tree Bancshares common
            stock pursuant to the merger agreement in relation to the historical
            book value of Marked Tree Bancshares common stock;

      o     the analysis previously presented by Mercer Capital to the Marked
            Tree Bancshares board with respect to the valuation of the Marked
            Tree Bancshares common stock;

      o     the financial and other significant terms of the proposed merger
            with Pocahontas Bancorp, and the review by Marked Tree Bancshares
            with its legal advisor of the provisions of the merger agreement;

      o     the expected impact of the merger on Marked Tree Bancshares'
            business, employees, customers and communities, the compatibility of
            the respective businesses and management philosophies of Pocahontas
            Bancorp and Marked Tree Bancshares, and the expectation that
            Pocahontas Bancorp will continue to provide quality service to the
            customers and the community served by Marked Tree Bancshares through
            First Community Bank;

      o     the fact that Pocahontas Bancorp has agreed to appoint E. Ritter
            Arnold and Daniel B. Hatzenbuehler to the First Community Bank board
            of directors, which is expected to provide a degree of continuity
            and involvement by Marked Tree Bancshares following the merger,
            which Marked Tree Bancshares believes will further promote the
            interests of Marked Tree Bancshares' stockholders, customers and
            employees;

      o     the fact that the receipt of Pocahontas Bancorp common stock in the
            merger generally will permit holders of Marked Tree Bancshares
            common stock to defer any federal income tax liability associated
            with the increase in the value of their stock as a result of the
            merger and to become stockholders of Pocahontas Bancorp, an
            institution with a history of ongoing growth in operations and
            earnings, consistent dividend payments, and share liquidity;

      o     the alternative strategic courses available to Marked Tree
            Bancshares, including remaining independent and exploring other
            potential business combination transactions; and

      o     the likelihood of receiving the requisite regulatory approvals in a
            timely manner.


                                       25
<PAGE>

      Marked Tree Bancshares' board also considered a variety of risks and
potentially negative factors in its deliberations concerning the merger,
including the following:

      o     the loss of control over the future operations of Marked Tree
            Bancshares and Marked Tree Bank following the merger;

      o     the fact that Marked Tree Bancshares could be effectively precluded
            from entering into any potentially superior merger with a third
            party because Pocahontas Bancorp required that voting agreements be
            executed by Marked Tree Bancshares' executive officers and
            directors, thereby effectively ensuring that 63% of the outstanding
            shares of Marked Tree Bancshares would be voted to approve the
            merger; and

      o     the other risks described in this document under "Risk Factors."

      The Marked Tree Bancshares board of directors did not believe that the
negative factors were sufficient, individually or in the aggregate, to outweigh
the potential benefits of the merger. In making its determination, the board did
not ascribe relative weights to the factors that it considered.

      It should be noted that this explanation of Marked Tree Bancshares board
of directors' reasoning and all other information presented in this section is
forward-looking in nature and, therefore, should be read in light of the factors
discussed under the heading "CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING
STATEMENTS" on page 16.

Board of Directors and Management of Pocahontas Bancorp Following the Merger

      Board of Directors of Pocahontas Bancorp. Upon completion of the merger,
the board of directors of Pocahontas Bancorp will consist of the seven persons

current management of Pocahontas Bancorp.

      As of January 28, 2003, the directors and executive officers of Pocahontas
Bancorp (eight persons) owned, in the aggregate, 23.4% of the total outstanding
shares of common stock of Pocahontas Bancorp. Information about the current
Pocahontas Bancorp directors and executive officers, including executive

Distribution of Pocahontas Bancorp Certificates

      At or prior to the completion of the merger, Pocahontas Bancorp will cause
to be deposited, with a bank or trust company or other stock transfer agent
acting as exchange agent, certificates representing shares of Pocahontas Bancorp
common stock for the benefit of the holders of certificates representing shares
of Marked Tree Bancshares common stock and cash in lieu of any fractional shares
that would otherwise be issued in the merger.

      Promptly after the completion of the merger, Pocahontas Bancorp will cause
the exchange agent to send transmittal materials to each holder of a Marked Tree
Bancshares stock certificate for use in exchanging Marked Tree Bancshares stock
certificates for certificates representing shares of Pocahontas Bancorp common
stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares, if applicable. Holders of Marked
Tree Bancshares stock certificates should NOT surrender their Marked Tree
Bancshares stock certificates for exchange until they receive the letter of
transmittal and instructions. The exchange agent will deliver certificates for
Pocahontas Bancorp common stock and, if applicable, a check instead of any
fractional shares of Pocahontas Bancorp common stock, once it receives the


                                       26
<PAGE>

properly completed transmittal materials together with certificates representing
a holder's shares of Marked Tree Bancshares common stock.

      Marked Tree Bancshares stock certificates may be exchanged for Pocahontas
Bancorp stock certificates through the exchange agent for up to one year after
the completion of the merger. At the end of that period, any Pocahontas Bancorp
stock certificates and cash will be returned to Pocahontas Bancorp. Any holders
of Marked Tree Bancshares stock certificates who have not exchanged their

Bancorp stock certificates and any cash to be received instead of fractional
shares of Pocahontas Bancorp common stock.

      If your Marked Tree Bancshares stock certificate has been lost, stolen or
destroyed, you may receive a Pocahontas Bancorp stock certificate upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact. Pocahontas Bancorp may require you to post
a bond in a reasonable amount as an indemnity against any claim that may be made
against Pocahontas Bancorp with respect to the lost, stolen or destroyed Marked
Tree Bancshares stock certificate.

      After completion of the merger, there will be no further transfers on the
stock transfer books of Marked Tree Bancshares.

      Pocahontas Bancorp will not issue any fractional shares of Pocahontas
Bancorp common stock. Instead, a Marked Tree Bancshares stockholder who would

Bancorp common stock to which such holder would otherwise be entitled multiplied
by the average of the closing prices of Pocahontas Bancorp common stock on the

consecutive trading days ending on the fifth business day before consummation of

Dissenters' Rights

      Pursuant to the provisions of Subchapter 10 of the Arkansas Business
Corporation Act, if the proposed merger is consummated, any holder of Marked
Tree Bancshares common stock who (i) gives to Marked Tree Bancshares, prior to
the vote at the special meeting with respect to the approval of the merger
agreement, written notice of such holder's objection to the merger, (ii) does
not vote in favor thereof, and (iii) the holder within ten (10) days after the
date on which the vote was taken makes written demand on the surviving
corporation for payment of the fair value of his shares, shall be entitled to
receive, upon compliance with the statutory requirements summarized below, the
fair value of such holder's shares as of the day prior to the date on which the
vote was taken approving the merger.

      The written notice requirement referred to above will not be satisfied
under the Arkansas statutory provisions by merely voting against approval of the
merger agreement by proxy or in person at the special meeting. In addition to
not voting in favor of the merger agreement, a stockholder wishing to preserve
the right to dissent and seek appraisal must give a separate written notice of
such holder's objection to the merger and provide notice to the surviving
corporation within ten (10) days after the shareholder's meeting of the holder's
intent to demand payment for such holder's shares if the proposed merger is
effected. The notice of the intent to demand payment must state the number and
class of the shares owned by the holder. Any holder failing to make demand
within the ten-day period will have forfeited any right to dissent from the
transaction, and shall receive the consideration to be paid pursuant to the
terms of the merger agreement.

      Any written notice of objection or intent to demand payment pursuant to
Subchapter 10 of the Arkansas Business Corporation Act should be addressed as
follows: Marked Tree Bancshares, 210 Frisco Street, Marked Tree, Arkansas
72365, Attention:  E. Ritter Arnold, President and Chief Executive Officer.

      Within ten (10) days after the merger is effected, Pocahontas Bancorp, as
the surviving corporation, is required to give notice to each holder who has
made demand as set forth above for the payment of the fair value of such
holder's shares of Marked Tree Bancshares stock.

      If within thirty (30) days after the date on which the merger was effected
the value of the shares is agreed upon between the dissenting shareholder and
Pocahontas Bancorp, payment must be made within ninety (90) days after the date
on which the merger was effected, upon the surrender of the holder's
certificates representing the dissenting shares.

      If a demand for payment under Section 4-26-1007 remains unsettled 30 days
after the merger is effected, the dissenting shareholder may commence a
proceeding in the Circuit Court of Pulaski County, Arkansas, within 60 days
after the expiration of the 30 day period. The Circuit Court shall determine the
fair value of the shares as of the day prior to the date on which the vote was
taken approving the merger. The dissenting shareholder shall be entitled to a
judgment in the amount of the fair value of the shares, together with interest
thereon to the date of the judgment.

      Upon payment of the fair value of the shares, the dissenting shareholder
shall cease to have any interest in the shares or in the surviving corporation.

      The foregoing is a summary of the material rights of a dissenting
stockholder of Marked Tree Bancshares, but is qualified in its entirety by
reference to Subchapter 10 of the Arkansas Business Corporation Act, included in
Appendix II to this proxy statement/prospectus. It is not intended to grant or
enlarge any right of dissent or payment to any stockholder and should not be so
read. Stockholders' rights of dissent and payment are limited to those provided
by law. Any Marked Tree Bancshares stockholder who intends to exercise the right
to dissent from consummation of the proposed merger should carefully review the
text of such provisions and should also consult


                                       28
<PAGE>

with such holder's attorney. No further notice of the events giving rise to
dissenters' rights or any steps associated therewith will be furnished to Marked
Tree Bancshares stockholders, except as indicated above or otherwise required by
law.

      Any dissenting Marked Tree Bancshares stockholder who perfects such
holder's right to be paid the value of such holder's shares will recognize
taxable gain or loss upon receipt of cash for such shares for federal income tax
purposes.

Resales of Pocahontas Bancorp Stock by Affiliates

      Affiliates of Marked Tree Bancshares, as defined under Rule 145 under the
Securities Act, generally may not sell their shares of Pocahontas Bancorp common
stock acquired in the merger except pursuant to an effective registration
statement under the Securities Act or an applicable exemption from the
registration requirements of the Securities Act, including Rule 145 issued by
the SEC under the Securities Act. Affiliates include directors and executive
officers of Marked Tree Bancshares.

      Under the merger agreement, Marked Tree Bancshares agreed to, and has
provided Pocahontas Bancorp with a list of the persons who, to Marked Tree
Bancshares' knowledge, may be deemed to be affiliates of Marked Tree Bancshares.
Marked Tree Bancshares has also delivered a letter of agreement from each of
these persons by which that person agrees, among other things, not to offer to
sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of the shares of Pocahontas Bancorp
common stock distributed to him pursuant to the merger except in compliance with
Rule 145 under the Securities Act, in a transaction that, in the opinion of
counsel reasonably satisfactory to Pocahontas Bancorp, is otherwise exempt from
the registration requirements of the Securities Act, or in an offering
registered under the Securities Act. Pocahontas Bancorp may place restrictive
legends on its common stock certificates that are issued to persons who are
deemed to be affiliates of Marked Tree Bancshares under the Securities Act.

      This document does not cover any resales of Pocahontas Bancorp common
stock received in the merger by any person who may be deemed an affiliate of
Marked Tree Bancshares.

Interests of Certain Marked Tree Bancshares' Directors and Officers in the
Merger that Differ from Your Interests

      Some members of Marked Tree Bancshares' management and board of directors
have interests in the merger that are in addition to or different from their
interests as stockholders of Marked Tree Bancshares generally. Marked Tree
Bancshares' board of directors considered these interests (as described in the
following paragraphs) in approving the merger agreement.

      First Community Board of Directors. The merger agreement provides that
following completion of the merger, First Community Bank will expand its board
of directors by two members and Pocahontas Bancorp will cause E. Ritter Arnold,
President, Chief Executive Officer and a director of Marked Tree Bancshares and
Daniel B. Hatzenbuehler, Secretary and a director of Marked Tree Bancshares, to
be appointed to that board. Each member of the board of directors will receive a
monthly fee of $500 for service on the board.

      Protection of Marked Tree Bancshares Directors and Officers Against
Claims. For three years from the consummation of the merger, Pocahontas Bancorp
has agreed to indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director and
officer of Marked Tree Bancshares from liability and expenses arising out of
matters existing or occurring at or prior to the consummation of the merger to
the fullest extent such persons would have been indemnified as a director or
officer of Marked Tree Bancshares or any of its subsidiaries under Arkansas law
and Marked Tree Bancshares' articles of incorporation and bylaws. This
indemnification extends to liability arising out of the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement. Pocahontas Bancorp has also agreed to
advance any costs to each of these persons as they are incurred to the fullest
extent permitted under Arkansas law. Pocahontas Bancorp has also agreed that it
will use its best efforts to maintain a policy of directors' and officers'
liability insurance coverage for the benefit of Marked Tree Bancshares'
directors and officers for six years following consummation of the merger.


                                       29

Employee Benefits Following the Merger

      Employees of Marked Tree Bancshares or Marked Tree Bank who continue as
employees of Pocahontas Bancorp or First Community Bank after the merger will
receive credit for service with Marked Tree Bancshares or Marked Tree Bank (for
purposes of eligibility and vesting determination but not for benefit accrual
purposes) under any similar existing Pocahontas Bancorp benefit plan or new
Pocahontas Bancorp benefit plan in which the employees would be eligible to
enroll. Pocahontas Bancorp will make available to continuing employees and their
dependents employer-provided health coverage on the same basis as it provides
such coverage to employees of Pocahontas Bancorp or First Community Bank, except
that preexisting condition eligibility waiting period or other limitations and
exclusions otherwise applicable under the plans to new employees shall not apply
to such employees or their covered dependents who are covered under a similar
Marked Tree Bank plan on the merger effective date.

Acquisitions Generally

      Pocahontas Bancorp regularly evaluates acquisition opportunities and
conducts due diligence activities in connection with possible acquisitions. As a
result, acquisition discussions and, in some cases, negotiations may take place
and future acquisitions involving cash, debt or equity securities may occur.

Regulatory Approvals

      The merger is subject to the approval of the Office of Thrift Supervision.
On January __, 2003, Pocahontas Bancorp filed an application for approval of the
merger with the Office of Thrift Supervision. Pocahontas Bancorp expects Office
of Thrift Supervision approval of the merger in March 2003.

      Under federal law, a period of 15 days must expire following approval by
the Office of Thrift Supervision within which period the Department of Justice
may file objections to the merger under the federal antitrust laws. The parties
do not expect that the Department of Justice will object to the merger.

      It is a condition to the consummation of the merger that all requisite
regulatory approvals be obtained without any conditions that are in Pocahontas
Bancorp's reasonable judgment unduly burdensome. Although not expected, no
assurance can be given that Office of Thrift Supervision approval will not
contain any such condition or restriction.

Fairness Opinion

      The board of directors of Marked Tree Bancshares did not seek or obtain a
fairness opinion from a financial advisor as to the fairness from financial
point of view of the merger consideration to be obtained by stockholders of
Marked Tree Bancshares in the merger.

                             THE MERGER AGREEMENT

      The following describes certain aspects of the proposed merger, including
material provisions of the merger agreement. The following description of the
merger agreement is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by reference to,
the merger agreement, which is attached as Appendix I to this document and is
incorporated by reference into this document. We urge you to read the merger
agreement carefully and in its entirety.

Terms of the Merger

      The merger agreement provides for the merger of Marked Tree Bancshares
with and into Pocahontas Bancorp. Pocahontas Bancorp will be the surviving
corporation after the merger. Each share of Marked Tree Bancshares common stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the completion of the merger, except
for certain shares of Marked Tree Bancshares common stock held by Marked Tree
Bancshares as treasury stock, will be converted into the number of shares of
Pocahontas Bancorp common stock determined by dividing the stated book value per
share of Marked Tree Bancshares by the stated book value per share of Pocahontas
Bancorp. Stated book value per share will be calculated as of the last calendar
quarter-end prior to the consummation of the merger. For


                                       30
<PAGE>

example, assuming the merger was to be consummated before March 31, 2003, the
stated book value per share would be calculated as of December 31, 2002. As of
that date, the stated book value per share of Pocahontas Bancorp was $11.10 and
the stated book value per share of Marked Tree Bancshares was $1,152.82;
accordingly, the number of shares of Pocahontas Bancorp common stock that you
would receive for each share of Marked Tree Bancshares that you own would be
103.86 (determined by dividing $1,152.82 by $11.10).

      The exchange ratio, determined as provided above, is subject to
adjustment. If the average of the closing prices of Pocahontas Bancorp common
stock on the NASDAQ National Market (as reported by the Wall Street Journal) for
the 20 consecutive trading days ending on the fifth business day before the
merger is consummated is more than 15% higher or more than 15% lower than
$10.35, then the exchange ratio will be decreased by the percentage by which
that average market value is higher than $10.35 or increased by the percentage
by which that market value is lower than $10.35, respectively. We refer to the
ratio of Pocahontas Bancorp common stock to be received for each share of Marked
Tree Bancshares common stock as the "exchange ratio."

      Pocahontas Bancorp will not issue any fractional shares of Pocahontas
Bancorp common stock in the merger. Instead, a Marked Tree Bancshares
stockholder who otherwise would have received a fraction of a share of
Pocahontas Bancorp common stock will receive an amount in cash. This cash amount
will be determined by multiplying the fraction of a share of Pocahontas Bancorp
common stock to which such holder would otherwise be entitled by the average of
the closing prices of Pocahontas Bancorp common stock on the NASDAQ National
Market (as reported by the Wall Street Journal) for the 20 consecutive trading
days ending on the fifth business day before we complete the merger.

Closing and Effective Time of the Merger

      The merger will be consummated only if all of the following occur:

      o     the merger agreement is adopted by Marked Tree Bancshares
            stockholders;

      o     we obtain all required regulatory consents and approvals; and

      o     all other conditions to the merger discussed in this document and
            the merger agreement are either satisfied or waived.

      The merger will become effective when a certificate of merger is filed
with the Delaware Secretary of State and articles of merger are filed with the
Arkansas Secretary of State, or at a later time as may be agreed upon by us and
indicated in the certificate of merger and articles of merger in accordance with
applicable law. In the merger agreement, the date for completion of the merger
will be mutually agreed by Pocahontas Bancorp and Marked Tree Bancshares, but
not later than 30 days after the last condition stated in the merger agreement
(including the expiration of any applicable waiting period) is fulfilled or
waived. It is currently anticipated that the effective time will occur during
the first or second calendar quarter of 2003, but we cannot guarantee when or if
the merger will be consummated.

Representations, Warranties, Covenants and Agreements

      The merger agreement contains representations and warranties of Marked
Tree Bancshares and Pocahontas Bancorp relating to their respective businesses
that are customary in merger transactions. The representations in the merger
agreement do not survive the effective time of the merger.

      Each of Pocahontas Bancorp and Marked Tree Bancshares has undertaken
customary covenants that place restrictions on it and its subsidiaries until the
effective time of the merger. In general, Pocahontas Bancorp and its
subsidiaries and Marked Tree Bancshares and its subsidiary are required to
conduct their respective businesses in the ordinary and usual course and to use
their best efforts to preserve intact their respective business organizations
and assets and to maintain their respective rights, franchises and relationships
with others having business dealings with them. Pocahontas Bancorp and its
subsidiaries and Marked Tree Bancshares and its subsidiary have also agreed to
various specific restrictions relating to the conduct of their respective
businesses. The merger agreement also


                                       31
<PAGE>

contains mutual covenants relating to the preparation of this document and the
holding of a special meeting of Marked Tree Bancshares stockholders, access to
information of the other party and public announcements with respect to the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

Declaration and Payment of Dividends

      Marked Tree Bancshares has agreed that it will not pay any regular or
special dividends or distributions, without the consent of Pocahontas Bancorp.

Agreement Not to Solicit Other Offers

      Marked Tree Bancshares has agreed that it will not, and will use all
reasonable efforts to cause its subsidiary and its subsidiary's representatives
not to, initiate, solicit or encourage any inquiries or any offer relating to a
merger, acquisition or other transaction involving the purchase of all or a
substantial part of the assets or any equity securities of Marked Tree
Bancshares or its subsidiary. Subject to the discharge of its board of
directors' fiduciary duties, Marked Tree Bancshares has also agreed not to
negotiate or provide any confidential information relating to any such
acquisition proposal. Marked Tree Bancshares has agreed that it will promptly
advise Pocahontas Bancorp following the receipt of any acquisition proposal.

Expenses and Fees

      Each party will bear all expenses incurred by it in connection with the
negotiation and consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement, including fees and expenses of its own financial consultants,
accountants and legal counsel. If the merger agreement is terminated by
Pocahontas Bancorp or Marked Tree Bancshares based on a breach of a
representation, warranty or covenant by the other of them, the breaching party
will pay to the nonbreaching party all out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred
in connection with the merger.

Termination Fee

      Marked Tree Bancshares will pay Pocahontas Bancorp a termination fee of
$115,000 if the merger agreement is terminated by Pocahontas Bancorp or Marked
Tree Bancshares and, prior to the termination, an acquisition proposal with
respect to Marked Tree Bancshares is begun or publicly announced and within 18
months after the termination of the merger agreement, Marked Tree Bancshares
enters into an agreement pursuant to the acquisition proposal or that proposal
has been consummated. The termination fee must also be paid if, after receiving
an acquisition proposal, the Marked Tree Bancshares board of directors does not
timely convene the special meeting of stockholders to vote on the merger and
recommend that stockholders adopt the merger agreement, and within 18 months
after the receipt of the acquisition proposal Marked Tree Bancshares enters into
an agreement relating to the proposal or the acquisition proposal is
consummated.

Conditions to Consummation of the Merger

      The respective obligations of Pocahontas Bancorp and Marked Tree
Bancshares to consummate the merger are subject to the fulfillment or waiver of
certain conditions, including:

      o     the adoption of the merger agreement by the holders of the requisite
            number of shares of Marked Tree Bancshares common stock;

      o     the receipt and effectiveness of all governmental and other
            approvals, registrations and consents, and the expiration of all
            related waiting periods required to consummate the merger and to
            issue Pocahontas Bancorp common stock;

      o     the absence of action by any court or other governmental entity that
            prohibits consummation of the transactions contemplated by the
            merger agreement;


                                       32
<PAGE>

      o     the registration statement with respect to the Pocahontas Bancorp
            common stock to be issued pursuant to the merger will have become
            effective under the Securities Act and no stop order suspending the
            effectiveness of the registration statement will have been issued
            and no proceedings for that purpose will be pending or threatened by
            the SEC;

      o     all permits and other authorizations under the securities laws and
            other authorizations necessary to consummate the merger and to issue
            the shares of Pocahontas Bancorp common stock in the merger will
            have been received and be in full force and effect;

      o     the truth and correctness of the representations and warranties in
            the merger agreement, subject to certain specified exceptions, and
            the performance by Pocahontas Bancorp and Marked Tree Bancshares in
            all respects of its respective obligations under the merger
            agreement, except where the failure to perform would not have a
            material adverse effect;

      o     neither of Pocahontas Bancorp or Marked Tree Bancshares will have
            experienced a material adverse effect on its respective assets,
            financial condition or results of operations on a consolidated
            basis;

      o     all corporate action required to be taken to authorize the execution
            and performance of the merger agreement shall have been taken by
            each of Pocahontas Bancorp and Marked Tree Bancshares; and

      o     the receipt of an opinion from tax counsel with respect to the
            federal income tax effects of the merger.

      We cannot provide assurance as to when or if all of the conditions to the
merger can or will be satisfied or waived by the appropriate party. As of the
date of this document, we have no reason to believe that any of these conditions
will not be satisfied.

Possible Alternative Merger Structure

      The merger agreement provides that Pocahontas Bancorp is entitled to
revise the structure of the merger. However, a change may be made only if:

      o     there are no material adverse federal or state income tax
            consequences to stockholders of Marked Tree Bancshares or Marked
            Tree Bank as a result of the modification;

      o     the consideration to be paid to you under the merger agreement is
            not changed in kind or reduced in amount;

      o     there are no material adverse changes to the benefits provided to
            directors, officers and other employees of Marked Tree Bancshares
            and Marked Tree Bank; and

      o     the modification will not be likely to delay materially or
            jeopardize the receipt of required regulatory approvals.

Amendment, Waiver and Termination of the Merger Agreement

      The merger agreement may be amended or modified, in accordance with
applicable law, by written agreement of Pocahontas Bancorp and Marked Tree
Bancshares. The provisions of the merger agreement may be waived by the party
benefited by those provisions.

      The merger agreement may be terminated and the merger abandoned by
Pocahontas Bancorp and Marked Tree Bancshares at any time before the merger is
completed if they mutually agree to do so. In addition, the merger agreement may
be terminated by either Pocahontas Bancorp or Marked Tree Bancshares:


                                       33
<PAGE>

      o     if the other of them shall have breached any representation,
            warranty, covenant or other obligation that results in a material
            adverse effect and the breach cannot be or is not remedied within 30
            days;

      o     if the merger is not consummated by July 31, 2003, unless the
            failure to consummate the merger is due to the failure by the
            terminating party to perform its agreements set forth in the merger
            agreement;

      o     if any regulatory authority whose approval has been requested
            advises in writing that its approval is unlikely to be granted,
            unless the failure to obtain the approval is due to the terminating
            party's failure to perform its agreements in the merger agreement;
            or

      o     if the approval of the Marked Tree Bancshares stockholders is not
            obtained at the special meeting.

      Effect of Termination. If the merger agreement is terminated, it will
become void and there will be no liability on the part of either Pocahontas
Bancorp or Marked Tree Bancshares, except that termination will not relieve a
breaching party from liability for any willful breach of the merger agreement
and each party will bear its own costs and expenses incurred by it in connection
with the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

                             ACCOUNTING TREATMENT

      The merger will be accounted for as a "purchase," as that term is used
under generally accepted accounting principles, for accounting and financial
reporting purposes. Under purchase accounting, the assets and liabilities of
Marked Tree Bancshares as of the effective time of the merger will be recorded
at their respective fair values and added to those of Pocahontas Bancorp. Any
excess of purchase price over the fair values is recorded as goodwill. Goodwill
resulting from this transaction will be reported as an asset and will not be
amortized against earnings unless it becomes impaired based on analyses
performed by Pocahontas Bancorp on a periodic basis. Financial statements of
Pocahontas Bancorp issued after the merger would reflect such fair values and
would not be restated retroactively to reflect the historical financial position
or results of operations of Marked Tree Bancshares.

            MATERIAL FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER

      The following section describes the material federal income tax
consequences of the merger to holders of Marked Tree Bancshares common stock who
hold the common stock as a capital asset within the meaning of Section 1221 of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. This section does not apply to
special classes of taxpayers, such as:

      o     financial institutions;

      o     insurance companies;

      o     tax-exempt organizations;

      o     dealers in securities or currencies;

      o     traders in securities that elect to use a mark-to-market method of
            accounting;

      o     persons that hold Marked Tree Bancshares common stock as part of a
            straddle or conversion transaction;

      o     persons who are not citizens or residents of the United States; or

      o     stockholders who acquired their shares of Marked Tree Bancshares
            common stock through the exercise of an employee stock option or
            otherwise as compensation.


                                       34
<PAGE>

      The following is based upon the Internal Revenue Code, its legislative
history, existing and proposed regulations thereunder and published rulings and
decisions, all as currently in effect as of the date of this document, and all
of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. Tax
considerations under state, local and foreign laws are not addressed in this
document. Determining the actual tax consequences of the merger to you may be
complex. They will depend on your specific situation and on factors that are not
within our control. You should consult with your own tax advisor as to the tax
consequences of the merger in your particular circumstances, including the
applicability and effect of the alternative minimum tax and any state, local or
foreign and other tax laws and of changes in those laws.

      Tax Consequences of the Merger Generally. It is a condition to the merger
that stockholders of Marked Tree Bancshares receive a legal opinion of Baker,
Donelson, Bearman & Caldwell, counsel to Marked Tree Bancshares, and that
Pocahontas Bancorp receive a legal opinion of Luse Gorman Pomerenk & Schick,
P.C., counsel to Pocahontas Bancorp, to the effect that:

      o     the merger will be treated for federal income tax purposes as a
            reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal
            Revenue Code;

      o     no gain or loss will be recognized by Pocahontas Bancorp or its
            stockholders or subsidiaries or by Marked Tree Bancshares or its
            subsidiary as a result of the merger;

      o     no gain or loss will be recognized by stockholders of Marked Tree
            Bancshares who receive shares of Pocahontas Bancorp common stock in
            exchange for shares of Marked Tree Bancshares common stock, except
            with respect to cash received in lieu of fractional share interests;

      o     the holding period of Pocahontas Bancorp common stock received in
            exchange for shares of Marked Tree Bancshares common stock will
            include the holding period of the Marked Tree Bancshares common
            stock for which it is exchanged; and

      o     the basis of the Pocahontas Bancorp common stock received in the
            merger will be the same as the basis of the Marked Tree Bancshares
            common stock for which it is exchanged, less any basis attributable
            to fractional shares for which cash is received.

      In rendering these opinions, counsel may require and rely upon
representations contained in letters and certificates to be received from Marked
Tree Bancshares, Pocahontas Bancorp and others. These tax opinions will not be
binding on the Internal Revenue Service. Neither Pocahontas Bancorp nor Marked
Tree Bancshares intends to request any ruling from the Internal Revenue Service
as to the federal income tax consequences of the merger.

      Cash Received in Lieu of a Fractional Share of Pocahontas Bancorp Common
Stock. A stockholder of Marked Tree Bancshares who receives cash in lieu of a
fractional share of Pocahontas Bancorp common stock will be treated as having
received the fractional share pursuant to the merger and then as having
exchanged the fractional share for cash in a redemption by Pocahontas Bancorp.
As a result, a Marked Tree Bancshares stockholder will generally recognize gain
or loss equal to the difference between the amount of cash received and the
portion of the basis of the shares of Pocahontas Bancorp common stock allocable
to his fractional interest. This gain or loss will generally be capital gain or
loss, and will be long-term capital gain or loss if, as of the date of the
exchange, the holding period for such shares is greater than one year. Long-term
capital gain of a non-corporate holder is generally subject to tax at a maximum
federal tax rate of 20%.

      Backup Withholding and Information Reporting. Payments of cash to a holder
surrendering shares of Marked Tree Bancshares common stock will be subject to
information reporting and backup withholding at a rate of 30% of the cash
payable to the holder, unless the holder furnishes its taxpayer identification
number in the manner prescribed in applicable Treasury Regulations, certifies
that such number is correct, certifies as to no loss of exemption from backup
withholding, and meets certain other conditions. Any amounts withheld from
payments to a holder under the backup withholding rules will be allowed as a
refund or credit against the holder's federal income tax liability, provided the
required information is furnished to the Internal Revenue Service.

      In this section, we describe the material features and rights of the
Pocahontas Bancorp capital stock after the merger. This summary is qualified in
its entirety by reference to applicable Delaware law and Pocahontas Bancorp's
certificate of incorporation and bylaws. See "WHERE YOU CAN FIND MORE
INFORMATION" on page 44.

General

      Pocahontas Bancorp is authorized to issue 8,000,000 shares of common stock
having a par value of $0.01 per share and 500,000 shares of preferred stock
having a par value of $0.01 per share, none of which preferred stock is issued
or outstanding. Each share of Pocahontas Bancorp common stock has the same
relative rights as, and is identical in all respects to, each other share of
Pocahontas Bancorp common stock.

      As of December 31, 2002, there were 4,299,395 shares of common stock of
Pocahontas Bancorp outstanding, 3,192,958 shares of common stock of Pocahontas
Bancorp were held in treasury and 342,623 shares of common stock of Pocahontas
Bancorp were reserved for issuance pursuant to Pocahontas Bancorp's employee
benefit plans and the Pocahontas Bancorp stock option plan. After giving effect
to the merger on a pro forma basis (using an exchange ratio of 103.86),
approximately 4,589,595 shares of Pocahontas Bancorp common stock will be
outstanding. The precise number of shares of Pocahontas Bancorp common stock to
be issued in the merger cannot be determined until the exchange ratio is set.

Common Stock

      Dividends. Subject to certain regulatory restrictions, Pocahontas Bancorp
can pay dividends out of statutory surplus or from certain net profits if, as
and when declared by its board of directors. Funds for Pocahontas Bancorp
dividends are generally provided through dividends from First Community Bank.
The payment of dividends by First Community Bank is subject to limitations that
are imposed by law and applicable regulation. The holders of common stock of
Pocahontas Bancorp are entitled to receive and share equally in such dividends
as may be declared by the board of directors of Pocahontas Bancorp out of funds
legally available therefor. If Pocahontas Bancorp issues preferred stock, the
holders thereof may have a priority over the holders of the common stock with
respect to dividends.

      Voting Rights. The holders of common stock of Pocahontas Bancorp possess
exclusive voting rights in Pocahontas Bancorp. They elect the Pocahontas Bancorp
board of directors and act on such other matters as are required to be presented
to them under Delaware law or as are otherwise presented to them by the board of
directors. Each holder of common stock is entitled to one vote per share and
does not have any right to cumulate votes in the election of directors. If
Pocahontas Bancorp issues preferred stock, holders of the preferred stock may
also possess voting rights. Certain matters require an 80% stockholder vote,
which is calculated after giving effect to a provision limiting voting rights.
This provision in Pocahontas Bancorp's certificate of incorporation provides
that stockholders who beneficially own in excess of 10% of the then outstanding
shares of common stock of Pocahontas Bancorp are not entitled to any vote with
respect to the shares held in excess of the 10% limit. A person or entity is
deemed to beneficially own shares that are owned by an affiliate as well as
persons acting in concert with such person or entity.

      Liquidation. In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of
First Community Bank, Pocahontas Bancorp, as holder of First Community Bank's
capital stock, would be entitled to receive, after payment or provision for
payment of all debts and liabilities of First Community Bank (including all
deposit accounts and accrued interest thereon) and after distribution of the
balance in the special liquidation account to eligible account holders, all
assets of First Community Bank available for distribution. In the event of
liquidation, dissolution or winding up of Pocahontas Bancorp, the holders of its
common stock would be entitled to receive, after payment or provision for
payment of all of its debts and liabilities, all of the assets of Pocahontas
Bancorp available for distribution. If preferred stock is issued, the holders
thereof may have a priority over the holders of the Pocahontas Bancorp common
stock in the event of liquidation or dissolution.


                                       36
<PAGE>

      Preemptive Rights. Holders of Pocahontas Bancorp common stock are not
entitled to preemptive rights with respect to any shares that may be issued. The
Pocahontas Bancorp common stock is not subject to redemption.

Preferred Stock

      Shares of Pocahontas Bancorp preferred stock may be issued with such
designations, powers, preferences and rights as the Pocahontas Bancorp board of
directors may from time to time determine. The Pocahontas Bancorp board of
directors can, without stockholder approval, issue preferred stock with voting,
dividend, liquidation and conversion rights that could dilute the voting
strength of the holders of the common stock and may assist management in
impeding an unfriendly takeover or attempted change in control.

                EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON RIGHTS OF STOCKHOLDERS

      As a result of the proposed merger, holders of Marked Tree Bancshares
common stock will be exchanging their shares of a Arkansas corporation governed
by the Arkansas Business Corporation Act and Marked Tree Bancshares' articles of
incorporation (the "Articles") and bylaws, for shares of Pocahontas Bancorp, a
Delaware corporation governed by the Delaware General Corporation Law and
Pocahontas Bancorp certificate of incorporation (the "Certificate") and bylaws.
Certain significant differences exist between the rights of Marked Tree
Bancshares stockholders and those of Pocahontas Bancorp stockholders. The
material differences are summarized below. In particular, Pocahontas Bancorp's
Certificate and bylaws contain several provisions that under certain
circumstances may have an antitakeover effect in that they could impede or
prevent an acquisition of Pocahontas Bancorp unless the potential acquirer has
obtained the approval of Pocahontas Bancorp's board of directors. The following
discussion is necessarily general; it is not intended to be a complete statement
of all differences affecting the rights of stockholders and their respective
entities, and it is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Arkansas
Business Corporation Act and the Delaware General Corporation Law as well as to
Pocahontas Bancorp's Certificate and bylaws and Marked Tree Bancshares' Articles
and bylaws.

Antitakeover Provisions Generally

      The provisions of Pocahontas Bancorp's Certificate and bylaws described
below under the headings, "--Authorized Capital Stock," "--Amendment of
Certificate or Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws," "--Classified Board of
Directors and Absence of Cumulative Voting," "--Removal of Directors,"
"--Limitations on Director Liability," "--Special Meetings of Stockholders,"
"--Actions by Stockholders without a Meeting," "--10% Voting Limitation,"
"--Stockholder Nominations," and "-- Mergers, Consolidations, and Sales of
Assets Generally," and the provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law
described under the heading "-- Business Combinations with Certain Persons," are
referred to in this document as the "protective provisions." In general, one
purpose of the protective provisions is to assist Pocahontas Bancorp's board of
directors in playing a role in connection with attempts to acquire control of
Pocahontas Bancorp, so that the board can further and protect the interests of
Pocahontas Bancorp and its stockholders as appropriate under the circumstances,
including, if the board determines that a sale of control is in their best
interests, by enhancing the board's ability to maximize the value to be received
by the stockholders upon such a sale.

      Although Pocahontas Bancorp's management believes the protective
provisions are, therefore, beneficial to Pocahontas Bancorp's stockholders, the
protective provisions also may tend to discourage some takeover bids. As a
result, Pocahontas Bancorp's stockholders may be deprived of opportunities to
sell some or all of their shares at prices that represent a premium over
prevailing market prices. On the other hand, defeating undesirable acquisition
offers can be a very expensive and time-consuming process. To the extent that
the protective provisions discourage undesirable proposals, Pocahontas Bancorp
may be able to avoid those expenditures of time and money.

      The protective provisions also may discourage open market purchases by a
potential acquirer. Such purchases may increase the market price of Pocahontas
Bancorp common stock temporarily, enabling stockholders to sell their shares at
a price higher than that which otherwise would prevail. In addition, the
protective provisions may decrease the market price of Pocahontas Bancorp common
stock by making the stock less attractive to persons who invest in securities in
anticipation of price increases from potential acquisition attempts. The
protective provisions also may make it more difficult and time consuming for a
potential acquirer to obtain control of Pocahontas Bancorp through replacing the
board of directors and management. Furthermore, the protective


                                       37
<PAGE>

provisions may make it more difficult for Pocahontas Bancorp's stockholders to
replace the board of directors or management, even if a majority of the
stockholders believes such replacement is in the best interests of Pocahontas
Bancorp. As a result, the protective provisions may tend to perpetuate the
incumbent board of directors and management.

Authorized Capital Stock

      Pocahontas Bancorp. Pocahontas Bancorp's Certificate authorizes the
issuance of up to 8,000,000 shares of Pocahontas Bancorp common stock, of which
7,492,353 shares were issued and 4,299,395 shares were outstanding as of
December 31, 2002, and 500,000 shares of preferred stock, none of which are
outstanding. Pocahontas Bancorp's board of directors may authorize the issuance
of additional shares of Pocahontas Bancorp common stock or preferred stock
without further action by Pocahontas Bancorp's stockholders. Pocahontas
Bancorp's Certificate does not provide preemptive rights to Pocahontas Bancorp
stockholders.

      The authority to issue additional shares of Pocahontas Bancorp capital
stock provides Pocahontas Bancorp with the flexibility necessary to meet its
future needs without the delay resulting from seeking stockholder approval. The
authorized but unissued shares of Pocahontas Bancorp common stock will be
issuable from time to time for any corporate purpose, including, without
limitation, stock splits, stock dividends, employee benefit and compensation
plans, acquisitions, and public or private sales for cash as a means of raising
capital. Such shares could be used to dilute the stock ownership of persons
seeking to obtain control of Pocahontas Bancorp. In addition, the sale of a
substantial number of shares of Pocahontas Bancorp common stock to persons who
have an understanding with Pocahontas Bancorp concerning the voting of such
shares, or the distribution or declaration of a dividend of shares of Pocahontas
Bancorp common stock (or the right to receive Pocahontas Bancorp common stock)
to Pocahontas Bancorp stockholders, may have the effect of discouraging or
increasing the cost of unsolicited attempts to acquire control of Pocahontas
Bancorp.

      Marked Tree Bancshares. Marked Tree Bancshares' authorized capital stock
consists of 250,000 shares of Marked Tree Bancshares common stock, of which
2,794.145 shares were issued and outstanding as of the record date, and 100,000
shares of preferred stock, none of which are outstanding.

      Pursuant to the Arkansas Business Corporation Act, Marked Tree Bancshares'
board of directors may issue additional shares of Marked Tree Bancshares common
stock which are authorized under its Articles of Incorporation, subject to
preemptive rights granted pursuant to Section 4-26-711 of the Arkansas Business
Corporation Act. Marked Tree Bancshares' Articles do not eliminate the
preemptive rights provided by the Arkansas Business Corporation Act.

Amendment of Certificate or Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws

      Pocahontas Bancorp. The Delaware General Corporation Law generally
provides that the approval of a corporation's board of directors and the
affirmative vote of a majority of (i) all shares entitled to vote thereon and
(ii) the shares of each class of stock entitled to vote thereon as a class is
required to amend a corporation's certificate of incorporation, unless the
certificate specifies a greater voting requirement. Pocahontas Bancorp's
certificate of incorporation states that its provisions regarding authorized
capital stock, election, classification, and removal of directors, the approval
required for certain business combinations, meetings of stockholders, and
amendment of the Certificate and bylaws may be amended or repealed only by the
affirmative vote of the holders of at least 80% of the outstanding shares of
Pocahontas Bancorp common stock.

      Pocahontas Bancorp's certificate of incorporation also provides that the
board of directors has the power to adopt, amend, or repeal the bylaws. Any
action taken by the stockholders with respect to adopting, amending, or
repealing any bylaws may be taken only upon the affirmative vote of the holders
of at least 80% of the outstanding shares of Pocahontas Bancorp common stock.

      Marked Tree Bancshares. The Arkansas Business Corporation Act generally
provides that an Arkansas corporation's articles of incorporation may be amended
if the number of votes cast in favor of the amendment


                                       38
<PAGE>

constitutes at least two-thirds of the shares entitled to vote on the matter.
The Marked Tree Bancshares Articles do not alter the voting requirement of the
Arkansas Business Corporation Act.

      Marked Tree Bancshares' bylaws provide that the bylaws may be altered,
amended or repealed and new bylaws may be adopted by the board of directors at
any regular or special meeting of the board of directors.

Classified Board of Directors and Absence of Cumulative Voting

      Pocahontas Bancorp. Pocahontas Bancorp's certificate of incorporation
provides that Pocahontas Bancorp's board of directors is divided into three
classes, with each class to be as nearly equal in number as possible. The
directors in each class serve three-year terms of office.

      The effect of Pocahontas Bancorp's having a classified board of directors
is that only approximately one-third of the members of the board are elected
each year; consequently, two annual meetings are effectively required for
Pocahontas Bancorp's stockholders to change a majority of the members of the
Board.

      Pursuant to the Certificate, each stockholder generally is entitled to one
vote for each share of Pocahontas Bancorp stock held and is not entitled to
cumulative voting rights in the election of directors. With cumulative voting, a
stockholder has the right to cast a number of votes equal to the total number of
such holder's shares multiplied by the number of directors to be elected. The
stockholder has the right to cast all of such holder's votes in favor of one
candidate or to distribute such holder's votes in any manner among any number of
candidates. Directors are elected by a plurality of the total votes cast by all
stockholders. With cumulative voting, it may be possible for minority
stockholders to obtain representation on the board of directors. Without
cumulative voting, the holders of more than 50% of the shares of Pocahontas
Bancorp common stock generally have the ability to elect 100% of the directors.
As a result, the holders of the remaining Pocahontas Bancorp common stock
effectively may not be able to elect any person to the board of directors. The
absence of cumulative voting, therefore, could make it more difficult for a
stockholder who acquires less than a majority of the shares of Pocahontas
Bancorp common stock to obtain representation on Pocahontas Bancorp's board of
directors.

      Marked Tree Bancshares. Marked Tree Bancshares' Articles do not provide
for a classified board of directors. Holders of Marked Tree Bancshares common
stock are afforded cumulative voting rights pursuant to Section 4-26-708 of the
Arkansas Business Corporation Act.

Removal of Directors

      Pocahontas Bancorp. Under the Certificate, any director or the entire
board of directors may be removed only for cause by a vote of the holders of a
majority of the shares then entitled to vote at an election of directors.

      Marked Tree Bancshares. Under the Arkansas Business Corporation Act, the
stockholders of a corporation may remove a director with or without cause if the
number of votes cast to remove the director exceed the number of votes cast not
to remove the director. Such action may only be taken at a meeting called for
the purpose of removing the director, and the meeting notice must state that one
of the purposes of the meeting is to remove the director.

Limitations on Director Liability

      Pocahontas Bancorp. Pocahontas Bancorp's certificate of incorporation
provides that a director of Pocahontas Bancorp will have no personal liability
to Pocahontas Bancorp or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of
fiduciary duty as a director, except for liability for (i) any breach of the
director's duty of loyalty to the corporation or its stockholders, (ii) acts or
omissions not in good faith or that involve intentional misconduct or a knowing
violation of law, (iii) the payment of certain unlawful dividends and the making
of certain unlawful stock purchases or redemptions, or (iv) any transaction from
which the director derived an improper personal benefit.

      Although this provision does not affect the availability of injunctive or
other equitable relief as a remedy for a breach of duty by a director, it does
limit the remedies available to a stockholder who has a valid claim that a


                                       39
<PAGE>

director acted in violation of such director's duties, if the action is among
those as to which liability is limited. This provision may reduce the likelihood
of stockholder derivative litigation against directors and may discourage or
deter stockholders or management from bringing a lawsuit against directors for
breach of their duties, even though such action, if successful, might have
benefited Pocahontas Bancorp and its stockholders. The Securities and Exchange
Commission has taken the position that similar provisions added to other
corporations' certificates of incorporation would not protect those
corporations' directors from liability for violations of the federal securities
laws.

      Marked Tree Bancshares. The Marked Tree Bancshares Articles contain no
provisions to relieve the directors from personal liability. However, the
Arkansas Business Corporation Act and the bylaws of Marked Tree Bancshares do
provide for indemnification of directors in certain circumstances, as discussed
below.

Indemnification

      Pocahontas Bancorp. Pocahontas Bancorp's certificate of incorporation
provides that Pocahontas Bancorp will indemnify its officers, directors,
employees, and agents to the full extent permitted by the Delaware General
Corporation Law. Under Section 145 of the Delaware General Corporation Law as
currently in effect, other than in actions brought by or in the right of
Pocahontas Bancorp, such indemnification would apply if it were determined in
the specific case that the proposed indemnitee acted in good faith and in a
manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best
interests of Pocahontas Bancorp and, with respect to any criminal proceeding, if
such person had no reasonable cause to believe that the conduct was unlawful. In
actions brought by or in the right of Pocahontas Bancorp, such indemnification
probably would be limited to reasonable expenses (including attorneys' fees) and
would apply if it were determined in the specific case that the proposed
indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed
to be in or not opposed to the best interests of Pocahontas Bancorp, except that
no indemnification may be made with respect to any matter as to which such
person is adjudged liable to Pocahontas Bancorp, unless, and only to the extent
that, the court determines upon application that, in view of all the
circumstances of the case, the proposed indemnitee is fairly and reasonably
entitled to indemnification for such expenses as the court deems proper. To the
extent that any director, officer, employee, or agent of Pocahontas Bancorp has
been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit, or
proceeding, as discussed herein, whether civil, criminal, administrative, or
investigative, such person must be indemnified against reasonable expenses
incurred by such person in connection therewith.

      Marked Tree Bancshares. The Arkansas Business Corporation Act and the
Marked Tree Bancshares bylaws provide for indemnification of its directors,
officers, employees, and agents in substantially the same manner and with
substantially the same effect as in the case of Pocahontas Bancorp.

Special Meetings of Stockholders

      Pocahontas Bancorp. Pocahontas Bancorp's Certificate and bylaws provide
that special meetings of stockholders may be called at any time, but only by the
board of directors of Pocahontas Bancorp. Pocahontas Bancorp stockholders do not
have the right to call a special meeting or to require that Pocahontas Bancorp's
board of directors call such a meeting. This provision, combined with other
provisions of the Certificate and the restriction on the removal of directors,
would prevent a substantial stockholder from compelling stockholder
consideration of any proposal (such as a proposal for a business combination)
over the opposition of Pocahontas Bancorp's board of directors by calling a
special meeting of stockholders at which such stockholder could replace the
entire board with nominees who were in favor of such proposal.

      Marked Tree Bancshares. Marked Tree Bancshares' Bylaws provide that
special meetings of stockholders shall be called by Marked Tree Bancshares upon
request by the holders of 10% or more of all the shares of Marked Tree
Bancshares which are outstanding and entitled to vote at the meeting. The bylaws
also provide that special meetings of the stockholders may be called at any time
by a majority of the Marked Tree Bancshares board or the President.


                                       40
<PAGE>

Actions by Stockholders without a Meeting

      Pocahontas Bancorp. Pocahontas Bancorp's certificate of incorporation
provides that any action required or permitted to be taken by Pocahontas Bancorp
stockholders must be effected at a duly called meeting of stockholders and may
not be effected by any written consent by the stockholders. These provisions
would prevent stockholders from taking action, including action on a business
combination, except at an annual meeting or special meeting called by the board
of directors, chief executive officer, or secretary, even if a majority of the
stockholders were in favor of such action.

      Marked Tree Bancshares.  Under the Marked Tree Bancshares bylaws, any
action requiring stockholder approval may be approved by the unanimous
written consent of stockholders.

10% Voting Limitation

      Pocahontas Bancorp. The certificate of incorporation of Pocahontas Bancorp
provides that a holder of more than 10% of the then outstanding shares of common
stock of Pocahontas Bancorp will not be permitted to vote in respect of shares
held in excess of the 10% limit. There is no provision for a waiver by the board
of directors of this 10% voting limitation.

      Marked Tree Bancshares.  The articles of incorporation of Marked Tree
Bancshares have no equivalent provision to the 10% voting limitation.

Stockholder Nominations

      Pocahontas Bancorp. Pocahontas Bancorp's Certificate and bylaws provide
that any nomination by stockholders of individuals for election to the board of
directors must be made by delivering written notice of such nomination (the
"Nomination Notice") to the Secretary of Pocahontas Bancorp not less than 90
days before any meeting of the stockholders called for the election of
directors; provided, however, that if less than 100 days notice of the meeting
is given to stockholders, the Nomination Notice must be delivered to the
Secretary of Pocahontas Bancorp not later than the tenth day following the day
on which notice of the meeting was mailed to stockholders or such public
disclosure was made. The Nomination Notice must set forth certain background
information about the persons to be nominated, including information concerning
(i) the name, age, business, and, if known, residential address of each nominee,
(ii) the principal occupation or employment of each such nominee, and (iii) the
number of shares of Pocahontas Bancorp capital stock beneficially owned by each
such nominee. The board of directors is not required to nominate in the annual
proxy statement any person so proposed; however, compliance with this procedure
would permit a stockholder to nominate the individual at the stockholders'
meeting, and any stockholder may vote such holder's shares in person or by proxy
for any individual such holder desires.

      Marked Tree Bancshares.  Marked Tree Bancshares' Articles and bylaws do
not provide for special nominating procedures for election of directors.

Mergers, Consolidations, and Sales of Assets Generally

      Pocahontas Bancorp. Pocahontas Bancorp's certificate of incorporation
generally requires the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 80% of the
outstanding voting stock of Pocahontas Bancorp to effect certain "business
combinations" involving a "related person" or an "interested stockholder" except
in cases where the proposed transaction has been approved in advance by at least
a two-thirds vote of those members of the board of directors who are
unaffiliated with the related person or interested stockholder. The term
"related person" or "interested stockholder" includes any individual or entity
that beneficially owns or controls 10% or more of the outstanding shares of
voting stock of Pocahontas Bancorp. The term "business combination" includes a
merger or consolidation with or into any related person or interested
stockholder, the issuance of securities to that person, or the acquisition of
any securities of that person. In addition, the Delaware General Corporation Law
generally requires the approval of a majority of the outstanding voting stock of
Pocahontas Bancorp to effect (i) any merger or consolidation with or into any
other corporation, (ii) any sale, lease, or exchange of all or substantially all
of Pocahontas Bancorp property and assets, or (iii) the dissolution of
Pocahontas Bancorp. However, pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation


                                       41
<PAGE>

Law, Pocahontas Bancorp may enter into a merger transaction without stockholder
approval if (i) Pocahontas Bancorp is the surviving corporation, (ii) the
agreement of merger does not amend in any respect Pocahontas Bancorp's
Certificate, (iii) each share of Pocahontas Bancorp stock outstanding
immediately prior to the effective date of the merger is to be an identical
outstanding or treasury share of Pocahontas Bancorp after the effective date of
the merger, and (iv) either no shares of Pocahontas Bancorp common stock and no
shares, securities, or obligations convertible into such stock are to be issued
or delivered under the plan of merger, or the authorized unissued shares or the
treasury shares of Pocahontas Bancorp common stock to be issued or delivered
under the plan of merger plus those initially issuable upon conversion of any
other shares, securities, or obligations to be issued or delivered under such
plan do not exceed 20% of the shares of Pocahontas Bancorp common stock
outstanding immediately prior to the effective date of the merger.

      Marked Tree Bancshares. The Arkansas Business Corporation Act generally
requires approval of at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares of a
corporation's voting stock to approve a merger, consolidation, share exchange,
sale of all or substantially all of the corporation's assets, or similar
corporate transaction.

Business Combinations with Certain Persons

      Pocahontas Bancorp. Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law
("Section 203") places certain restrictions on "business combinations" (as
defined in Section 203 to include, generally, mergers, sales and leases of
assets, issuances of securities, and similar transactions) by Delaware
corporations with an "interested stockholder" (as defined in Section 203 to
include, generally, the beneficial owner of 15% or more of the corporation's
outstanding voting stock). Section 203 generally applies to Delaware
corporations, such as Pocahontas Bancorp, that have a class of voting stock
listed on a national securities exchange, authorized for quotation on an
interdealer quotation system of a registered national securities association, or
held of record by more than 2,000 stockholders, unless the corporation expressly
elects in its certificate of incorporation or bylaws not to be governed by
Section 203.

      Pocahontas Bancorp has not specifically elected to avoid the application
of Section 203. As a result, Section 203 generally would prohibit a business
combination by Pocahontas Bancorp or a subsidiary with an interested stockholder
within three years after the person or entity becomes an interested stockholder,
unless (i) prior to the time when the person or entity becomes an interested
stockholder, Pocahontas Bancorp's board of directors approved either the
business combination or the transaction pursuant to which such person or entity
became an interested stockholder, (ii) upon consummation of the transaction in
which the person or entity became an interested stockholder, the interested
stockholder held at least 85% of the outstanding Pocahontas Bancorp voting stock
(excluding shares held by persons who are both officers and directors and shares
held by certain employee benefit plans), or (iii) once the person or entity
becomes an interested stockholder, the business combination is approved by
Pocahontas Bancorp's board of directors and by the holders of at least
two-thirds of the outstanding Pocahontas Bancorp voting stock, excluding shares
owned by the interested stockholder.

      Marked Tree Bancshares. The Arkansas Business Corporation Act requires
approval of at least two-thirds of the voting power of a corporation's stock for
these types of combinations.

Dissenters' Rights

      Pocahontas Bancorp. The rights of dissenting stockholders of Pocahontas
Bancorp are governed by the Delaware General Corporation Law. Pursuant thereto,
except as described below, any stockholder has the right to dissent from any
merger of which Pocahontas Bancorp could be a constituent corporation. No
appraisal rights are available, however, for (i) the shares of any class or
series of stock that is either listed on a national securities exchange, quoted
on the Nasdaq National Market, or held of record by more than 2,000 stockholders
or (ii) any shares of stock of the constituent corporation surviving a merger if
the merger did not require the approval of the surviving corporation's
stockholders, unless, in either case, the holders of such stock are required by
an agreement of merger or consolidation to accept for that stock something other
than: (a) shares of stock of the corporation surviving or resulting from the
merger or consolidation; (b) shares of stock of any other corporation that will
be listed at the effective date of the merger on a national securities exchange,
quoted on the Nasdaq National Market, or held of record by more than 2,000
stockholders; (c) cash in lieu of fractional shares of stock described in clause
(a) or (b) immediately above; or (d) any combination of the shares of stock and
cash in lieu of fractional shares


                                       42
<PAGE>

described in clauses (a) through (c) immediately above. Because Pocahontas
Bancorp common stock is quoted on the Nasdaq National Market, unless the
exception described immediately above applies, holders of Pocahontas Bancorp
common stock do not have dissenters' rights.

      Marked Tree Bancshares. A summary of the pertinent provisions of the
Arkansas Business Corporation Act pertaining to dissenters' rights is set forth
under the caption "The Merger--Dissenters' Rights," and such provisions are
included as Appendix II.

Stockholders' Rights to Examine Books and Records

      Pocahontas Bancorp. The Delaware General Corporation Law provides that a
stockholder may inspect books and records upon written demand under oath stating
the purpose of the inspection, if such purpose is reasonably related to such
person's interest as a stockholder.

      Marked Tree Bancshares. Pursuant to the Arkansas Business Corporation Act,
upon written notice of a demand to inspect corporate records, a person that has
been a stockholder for at least six months is entitled to inspect books and
records of account, board of director and stockholder meeting minutes and
stockholder records. If Marked Tree Bancshares refuses to permit the inspection,
the stockholder may file a civil action requesting a court order to permit
inspection. The court will grant the order if it finds the stockholder qualified
and is requesting the records for a proper purpose.

Dividends

      Pocahontas Bancorp. The Delaware General Corporation Law provides that,
subject to any restrictions in the corporation's certificate of incorporation,
dividends may be declared from the corporation's surplus, or, if there is no
surplus, from its net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is
declared and the preceding fiscal year. Dividends may not be declared, however,
if the corporation's capital has been diminished to an amount less than the
aggregate amount of all capital represented by the issued and outstanding stock
of all classes having a preference upon the distribution of assets.
Substantially all of the funds available for the payment of dividends by
Pocahontas Bancorp are derived from its subsidiary depository institutions.
There are various statutory limitations on the ability of Pocahontas Bancorp's
subsidiary depository institutions to pay dividends to Pocahontas Bancorp.

      Marked Tree Bancshares. Pursuant to the Arkansas Business Corporation Act,
a board of directors may from time to time make distributions to its
stockholders out of the unreserved and unrestricted earned surplus of the
corporation, or out of the capital surplus under certain conditions, or out of
the corporation's net profits for the current fiscal year. No dividend may be
declared or paid if there are reasonable grounds for believing that upon
payment: (i) the liabilities of the corporation would exceed its assets; (ii)
the corporation would be unable to pay its obligations to creditors as they
become due in the ordinary course of business; (iii) the highest liquidation
preferences of shares entitled to such preference over the shares receiving the
dividend would exceed the corporation's net assets; or (iv) the payment of the
dividend would be contrary to any provision of the corporation's Articles. As
with Pocahontas Bancorp, substantially all of the funds available for the
payment of dividends by Marked Tree Bancshares are also derived from its
subsidiary depository institution, and there are various statutory limitations
on the ability of such subsidiary to pay dividends to Marked Tree Bancshares.

      Section 2.01 Conversion and Exchange of Shares.

      (a) At the Company Merger Effective Date, by virtue of the Company Merger
and without any action on the part of Pocahontas Bancorp or Marked Tree
Bancshares or the holders of shares of Pocahontas Bancorp or Marked Tree
Bancshares Common Stock:

            (i) Each share of Marked Tree Bancshares Common Stock issued and
outstanding at the Company Merger Effective Date, excluding any Marked Tree
Bancshares Perfected Dissenting Shares and except as provided in clause (a) (ii)
of this Section and Section 2.05 hereof, shall cease to be outstanding, shall
cease to exist and shall be converted into and represent solely one share of
Pocahontas Bancorp Common Stock multiplied by the Exchange Ratio as determined
below (rounded to the nearest fourth decimal) (the "Merger Consideration").

            (ii) Any shares of Marked Tree Bancshares Common Stock that are
owned or held by either party or any of their respective Subsidiaries (other
than in a fiduciary capacity or in connection with debts previously contracted)
at the Company Merger Effective Date shall cease to exist, the certificates for
such shares shall as promptly as practicable be canceled, such shares shall not
be converted into or represent any shares of Pocahontas Bancorp Common Stock,
and no shares of Pocahontas Bancorp capital stock shall be issued or exchanged
therefor.

            (iii) Each share of Pocahontas Bancorp Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately before the Company Merger Effective Date shall remain an
outstanding share of common stock of Pocahontas Bancorp as the surviving
corporation.

            (iv) The holders of certificates representing shares of Marked Tree
Bancshares Common Stock shall cease to have any rights as stockholders of Marked
Tree Bancshares, except such rights, if any, as they may have pursuant to
applicable law.

      (b) Prior to the Company Merger Effective Date, Pocahontas Bancorp shall
appoint a bank, trust company or other stock transfer agent selected by it and
agreed to by Marked Tree Bancshares as the Exchange Agent to effect the exchange
of certificates evidencing shares of Marked Tree Bancshares Common Stock (any
such certificate being hereinafter referred to as a "Certificate") for shares of
Pocahontas Bancorp Common Stock to be received in the Company Merger. On the
Company Merger Effective Date, Pocahontas Bancorp shall have granted the
Exchange Agent the requisite power and authority to effect for and on behalf of
Pocahontas Bancorp the issuance of the number of shares of Pocahontas Bancorp
Common Stock issuable in the Company Merger. The Exchange Agent shall accept
such Certificates upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as
the Exchange Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in
accordance with customary exchange practices.

      (c) In connection with this Agreement, FCB and Marked Tree Bank shall
enter into the Agreement and Plan of Merger substantially in the form attached

dissenting stockholder who is entitled to payment for such stockholder's shares
of Marked Tree Bancshares Common Stock

<PAGE>

shall receive such payment therefor from the surviving corporation of the
Company Merger in an amount as determined pursuant to Section 4-26-1007 of the
Arkansas Business Corporation Act.

      Section 2.02 The Exchange Ratio. For purposes of this Agreement, the
Exchange Ratio means the number of shares of Pocahontas Bancorp Common Stock
determined by dividing the stated book value per share of Marked Tree Bancshares
by the stated book value per share of Pocahontas Bancorp; provided, however, if
the Valuation Period Market Value is more than 15% higher or more than 15% lower
than the Base Market Value, then the Exchange Ratio shall be decreased by the
percentage by which the Valuation Period Market Value is higher than the Base
Market Value or increased by the percentage by which the Valuation Period Market
Value is lower than the Base Market Value, respectively. For the purposes of the
preceding sentence, stated book value per share shall be calculated as of the
last calendar quarter-end prior to the Closing Date and shall be calculated in
accordance with GAAP.

      Section 2.03 Surviving Corporation in the Company Merger.

      (a) Pocahontas Bancorp shall be the surviving corporation in the Company
Merger. The headquarters of the surviving corporation shall be located in
Jonesboro, Arkansas, or such other city in Arkansas as shall have been
designated by Pocahontas Bancorp's Board of Directors.

of Incorporation of Pocahontas Bancorp as the surviving corporation, until

Bancorp, as then in effect, shall be the Bylaws of Pocahontas Bancorp as the
surviving corporation, until subsequently amended in accordance with the DGCL.

      (d) The directors and executive officers of Pocahontas Bancorp as the
surviving corporation following the Company Merger shall be the directors and
executive officers of the surviving corporation.

      (e) From and after the Company Merger Effective Date:

            (i) Pocahontas Bancorp as the surviving corporation shall possess
all assets and property of every description, and every interest in the assets
and property, wherever located, and the rights, privileges, immunities, powers,
franchises, and authority, of a public as well as of a private nature, of each
of Pocahontas Bancorp and Marked Tree Bancshares, and all obligations belonging
or due to each of Pocahontas Bancorp and Marked Tree Bancshares, all of which
shall vest in Pocahontas Bancorp as the surviving corporation without further
act or deed. Title to any real estate or any interest in the real estate vested
in Pocahontas Bancorp or Marked Tree Bancshares shall not revert or in any way
be impaired by reason of the Company Merger.

            (ii) Pocahontas Bancorp as the surviving corporation will be liable
for all the obligations of each of Pocahontas Bancorp and Marked Tree
Bancshares. Any claim existing, or action or proceeding pending, by or against
Pocahontas Bancorp or Marked Tree Bancshares, may be prosecuted to judgment,
with right of appeal, as if the Company Merger had not taken place, or
Pocahontas Bancorp as the surviving corporation may be substituted in its place.

            (iii) All the rights of creditors of each of Pocahontas Bancorp and
Marked Tree Bancshares will be preserved unimpaired, and all liens upon the
property of Pocahontas Bancorp and Marked Tree Bancshares will be preserved

shares of its common stock for the purpose of issuing its shares to Marked Tree

                                      I-6
<PAGE>

      (b) After the Company Merger Effective Date, holders of certificates
theretofore representing outstanding shares of Marked Tree Bancshares Common
Stock (other than as provided in Section 2.01(a)(ii) hereof), upon surrender of
such certificates to the Exchange Agent, shall be entitled to receive (i)
certificates for the number of whole shares of Pocahontas Bancorp Common Stock
into which shares of Marked Tree Bancshares Common Stock previously evidenced by
the certificates so surrendered shall have been converted, as provided in
Section 2.01 hereof, and (ii) cash payments in lieu of fractional shares, if
any, as provided in Section 2.05 hereof. As soon as practicable after the
Company Merger Effective Date, and in no event more than five (5) days
thereafter, the Exchange Agent will send a notice and transmittal form to each
Marked Tree Bancshares stockholder of record at the Company Merger Effective
Date whose Marked Tree Bancshares Common Stock shall have been converted into
Pocahontas Bancorp Common Stock, advising such stockholder of the effectiveness
of the Company Merger and the procedure for surrendering to the Exchange Agent
outstanding certificates previously representing Marked Tree Bancshares Common
Stock in exchange for new certificates for Pocahontas Bancorp Common Stock and
cash in lieu of fractional shares. Upon surrender, each certificate representing
Marked Tree Bancshares Common Stock shall be canceled.

      (c) Until surrendered as provided in this Section 2.04, each outstanding
certificate which, before the Company Merger Effective Date, represented Marked
Tree Bancshares Common Stock (other than shares canceled at the Company Merger
Effective Date pursuant to Section 2.01(a)(ii) hereof) will be deemed for all
corporate purposes to represent the number of whole shares of Pocahontas Bancorp
Common Stock into which the shares of Marked Tree Bancshares Common Stock
formerly represented thereby were converted and the right to receive cash in
lieu of fractional shares. However, until such outstanding certificates formerly
representing Marked Tree Bancshares Common Stock are so surrendered, no dividend
or distribution payable to holders of record of Pocahontas Bancorp Common Stock
shall be paid to any holder of such outstanding certificates, but upon surrender
of such outstanding certificates by such holder there shall be paid to such
holder the amount of any dividends or distributions, without interest,
previously paid with respect to such whole shares of Pocahontas Bancorp Common
Stock, but not paid to such holder, and which dividends or distribution had a
record date occurring on or after the Company Merger Effective Date and the
amount of any cash, without interest, payable to such holder in lieu of
fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.05 hereof. After the Company Merger
Effective Date, there shall be no further registration of transfers on the
records of Marked Tree Bancshares of outstanding certificates formerly
representing shares of Marked Tree Bancshares Common Stock and, if a certificate
formerly representing such shares is presented to Pocahontas Bancorp, it shall
be forwarded to the Exchange Agent for cancellation and exchange for a
certificate representing shares of Pocahontas Bancorp Common Stock and cash for
fractional shares (if any), as herein provided. Following one year after the
Company Merger Effective Date, the Exchange Agent shall return to Pocahontas
Bancorp as the surviving corporation any certificates for Pocahontas Bancorp
Common Stock and cash remaining in the possession of the Exchange Agent
(together with any dividends in respect thereof) and thereafter stockholders of
Marked Tree Bancshares shall look exclusively to Pocahontas Bancorp for shares
of the Pocahontas Bancorp Common Stock and cash to which they are entitled
hereunder.

      (d) All shares of Pocahontas Bancorp Common Stock and cash in lieu of any
fractional share issued and paid upon the conversion of Marked Tree Bancshares
Common Stock in accordance with the above terms and conditions shall be deemed
to have been issued and paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
such Marked Tree Bancshares Common Stock.

      (e) If any new certificate for Pocahontas Bancorp Common Stock is to be
issued in a name other than that in which the certificate surrendered in
exchange thereof is registered, it shall be a condition of the issuance therefor
that the certificate surrendered in exchange shall be properly endorsed and
otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such
transfer pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other taxes required by
reason of the issuance of a new certificate representing shares of Pocahontas
Bancorp Common Stock in any name other than that of the registered holder of the
certificate surrendered, or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent
that such tax has been paid or is not payable.

      (f) Certificates surrendered for exchange by any person who is an
"affiliate" of Marked Tree Bancshares for purposes of Rule 145(c) under the
Securities Act shall not be exchanged for Certificates representing shares of
Pocahontas Bancorp Common Stock until Pocahontas Bancorp has received the
written agreement of such person contemplated by Section 5.13 hereof.


                                      I-7
<PAGE>

      (g) In the event any certificate representing Marked Tree Bancshares
Common Stock shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, such shares of
Pocahontas Bancorp Common Stock and cash for fractional shares, if any, as may
be required pursuant hereto; provided, however, that Pocahontas Bancorp or the
Exchange Agent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the
issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed
certificate to deliver a bond in such sum as is reasonably necessary as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against Pocahontas Bancorp, Marked
Tree Bancshares, the Exchange Agent or any other party with respect to the
certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

      Section 2.05 No Fractional Shares. Notwithstanding any term or provision
hereof, no fractional shares of Pocahontas Bancorp Common Stock, and no
certificates or scrip therefor, or other evidence of ownership thereof, will be
issued upon the conversion of or in exchange for any shares of Marked Tree
Bancshares Common Stock; no dividend or distribution with respect to Pocahontas
Bancorp Common Stock shall be payable on or with respect to any fractional share
interest; and no such fractional share interest shall entitle the owner thereof
to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of Pocahontas Bancorp as the
surviving corporation. In lieu of such fractional share interest, any holder of
Marked Tree Bancshares Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to a
fractional share of Pocahontas Bancorp Common Stock will, promptly following
surrender of his certificate or certificates representing Marked Tree Bancshares
Common Stock outstanding immediately before the Company Merger Effective Date,
be paid the applicable cash value of such fractional share interest, which shall
be equal to the product of the fraction of the share to which such holder would
otherwise have been entitled and the Valuation Period Market Value. For the
purposes of determining any such fractional share interests, all shares of
Marked Tree Bancshares Common Stock owned by a Marked Tree Bancshares
stockholder shall be combined so as to calculate the maximum number of whole
shares of Pocahontas Bancorp Common Stock issuable to such Marked Tree
Bancshares stockholder.

Subsidiary, except for "at will" arrangements; (ii) any plan, arrangement or
contract providing for bonuses, pensions, options, deferred compensation,
retirement payments, profit sharing or similar arrangements for or with any past
or present officers, directors or employees of Marked Tree Bancshares or any

Bancshares or any Marked Tree Bancshares Subsidiary is an obligor to any person,
which instrument evidences or relates to indebtedness other than deposits,
repurchase agreements and bankers' acceptances established in the ordinary
course of business and transactions in "federal funds" or which contains
financial covenants or other restrictions (other than those relating to the
payment of principal and interest when due) which would be applicable on or
after the Closing Date to Pocahontas Bancorp or any Pocahontas Bancorp
Subsidiary; or (vi) any contract (other than this Agreement) limiting the
freedom, in any material respect, of Marked Tree Bancshares or Marked Tree Bank
to engage in any type of banking or bank-related business in which Marked Tree
Bancshares is permitted to engage under applicable law as of the date of this
Agreement.

      (b) True and correct copies of agreements, plans, arrangements and
instruments referred to in Section 3.08(a), have been provided to Pocahontas
Bancorp on or before the date hereof, are listed on Marked Tree Bancshares
Disclosure Schedule 3.08(a) and are in full force and effect on the date hereof,
and neither Marked Tree Bancshares nor any Marked Tree Bancshares Subsidiary
(nor, to the knowledge of Marked Tree Bancshares, any other party to any such
contract, plan, arrangement or instrument) has breached any provision of, or is
in default in any respect under any term of, any such contract, plan,
arrangement or instrument which breach has resulted in or will result in a
Material Adverse Effect with respect to Marked Tree Bancshares. Except as set
forth in Marked Tree Bancshares Disclosure Schedule 3.08(b), no party to any
material contract, plan, arrangement or instrument will have the right to
terminate any or all of the provisions of any such contract, plan, arrangement
or instrument as a result of the execution of, and the transactions contemplated
by, this Agreement. None of the employees (including officers) of Marked Tree
Bancshares, possesses the right to terminate his/her employment as a result of
the execution of this Agreement. No plan, employment agreement, termination
agreement, or similar agreement or arrangement to which Marked Tree Bancshares
or any Marked Tree Bancshares Subsidiary is a party or under which Marked Tree
Bancshares or any Marked Tree Bancshares Subsidiary may be liable permit any
employee or independent contractor to terminate such plan, agreement or
arrangement without cause and continue to accrue future benefits thereunder. No
such agreement, plan or arrangement (x) provides for acceleration in the vesting
of benefits or payments due thereunder upon the occurrence of a change in
ownership or control of Marked Tree Bancshares or any Marked Tree Bancshares
Subsidiary absent the occurrence of a subsequent event; or (y) requires Marked
Tree Bancshares or any Marked Tree Bancshares Subsidiary to provide a benefit in
the form of Marked Tree Bancshares Common Stock or determined by reference to
the value of Marked Tree Bancshares Common Stock. No such agreement, plan or
arrangement with respect to officers of Marked Tree Bancshares, or to Marked
Tree Bancshares' knowledge, to its employees, provides for benefits which may
cause the disallowance of a federal income tax deduction under IRC Section 280G.

      Section 3.09 Ownership of Property; Insurance Coverage.

      (a) Marked Tree Bancshares and the Marked Tree Bancshares Subsidiaries
have good and marketable title to all material assets and properties owned by
Marked Tree Bancshares or any Marked Tree Bancshares Subsidiary in the conduct
of their businesses, whether such assets and properties are real or personal,
tangible or intangible, including assets and property reflected in the balance
sheets contained in the Marked Tree Bancshares Regulatory Reports and in the
Marked Tree Bancshares Financials or acquired subsequent thereto (except to the
extent that such assets and properties have been disposed of in the ordinary
course of business, since the date of such balance sheets), subject to no
material encumbrances, liens, mortgages, security interests or pledges, except
(i) those items that secure liabilities for public or statutory obligations or
any discount with, borrowing from or other obligations to any Federal Reserve
Bank or any Federal Home Loan Bank, inter-bank credit facilities, or any
transaction by a Marked Tree Bancshares Subsidiary acting in a fiduciary
capacity, (ii) statutory liens for amounts not yet delinquent or which are being
contested in good faith, and (iii) items permitted under Article IV of this
Agreement. Marked Tree Bancshares and the Marked Tree Bancshares Subsidiaries,
as lessees, have the right under valid and subsisting leases of real and
personal properties used by Marked Tree Bancshares and its Subsidiaries in the
conduct of their businesses to occupy or use all such properties as presently
occupied and used by each of them. Such existing leases and commitments to lease
constitute or will constitute operating leases for both tax and financial
accounting purposes and the lease expense and minimum rental commitments with
respect to such leases and lease commitments are as disclosed in the notes to
the Marked Tree Bancshares Financials.

      (b) With respect to all material agreements pursuant to which Marked Tree
Bancshares or any Marked Tree Bancshares Subsidiary has purchased securities
subject to an agreement to resell, if any, Marked Tree Bancshares or such Marked
Tree Bancshares Subsidiary, as the case may be, has a lien or security interest
(which to Marked Tree Bancshares' knowledge is a valid, perfected first lien) in
the securities or other collateral securing the repurchase agreement, and the
value of such collateral equals or exceeds the amount of the debt secured
thereby.

      (c) Marked Tree Bancshares and each Marked Tree Bancshares Subsidiary
currently maintains insurance reasonable for their respective operations and
similar in scope and coverage to that customarily maintained by other businesses
similarly engaged in a similar location. Marked Tree Bancshares has not received
notice from any insurance carrier that (i) such insurance will be canceled or
that coverage thereunder will be reduced or eliminated, or (ii) premium costs
with respect to such policies of insurance will be substantially increased.
There are presently no material claims pending under such policies of insurance
and no notices have been given by Marked Tree Bancshares under such policies.
All such insurance is in full force and effect and is valid and enforceable,
except as enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or other laws affecting the enforcement of creditors'
rights generally and except that the availability of the equitable remedy of
specific performance or injunctive relief is subject to the discretion of the
court before which any proceedings may be brought, and within the last three
years Marked Tree Bancshares has received each type of insurance coverage for
which it has applied and during such periods has not been denied indemnification
for any material claims submitted under any of its insurance policies.

      Section 3.10 Legal Proceedings. Except as set forth in Marked Tree
Bancshares Disclosure Schedule 3.10, neither Marked Tree Bancshares nor any
Marked Tree Bancshares Subsidiary is a party to any, and there are no pending
or, to the best of Marked Tree Bancshares' knowledge, threatened legal,
administrative, arbitration or other proceedings, claims (whether asserted or
unasserted), actions or governmental investigations or inquiries of any nature
(i) against Marked Tree Bancshares or any Marked Tree Bancshares Subsidiary,
(ii) to which Marked Tree Bancshares' or any Marked Tree Bancshares Subsidiary's
assets are or may be subject, (iii) challenging the validity or propriety of any
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or (iv) which could
adversely affect the ability of Marked Tree Bancshares to perform under this
Agreement, except for any proceedings, claims, actions, investigations or
inquiries referred to in clauses (i) or (ii) which, if adversely determined,
individually or in the aggregate, could not be reasonably expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Marked Tree Bancshares and the Marked Tree Bancshares
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

all licenses, franchises, permits and authorizations necessary for the lawful
conduct of their respective businesses under, and have complied in all material
respects with, applicable laws, statutes, orders, rules or regulations of any
federal, state or local governmental authority relating to them, other than
where such failure to hold or such noncompliance will neither result in a
limitation in any material respect on the conduct of their respective businesses
nor otherwise have a Material Adverse Effect on Marked Tree Bancshares and the
Marked Tree Bancshares Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

      (b) Except as set forth in Marked Tree Bancshares Disclosure Schedule
3.11(b), neither Marked Tree Bancshares nor any Marked Tree Bancshares

Authority (i) asserting that Marked Tree Bancshares or any Marked Tree
Bancshares Subsidiary is not in material compliance with any of the statutes,
regulations or ordinances which such Regulatory Authority enforces; (ii)
threatening to revoke any license, franchise, permit or governmental
authorization which is material to Marked Tree Bancshares or any Marked Tree
Bancshares Subsidiary; (iii) requiring or threatening to require Marked Tree
Bancshares or any Marked Tree Bancshares Subsidiary, or indicating that Marked
Tree Bancshares or any Marked Tree Bancshares Subsidiary may be required, to
enter into a cease and desist order, agreement or memorandum of understanding or
any other agreement with any federal or state governmental agency or authority
which is charged with the supervision or regulation of banks or engages in the
insurance of bank deposits restricting or limiting, or purporting to restrict or
limit, in any material respect the operations of Marked Tree Bancshares or any
Marked Tree Bancshares Subsidiary, including without limitation any restriction
on the payment of dividends (other than such restrictions or limitations
generally applicable to banking institutions as set forth in statutes or
regulations of such Regulatory Authorities); or (iv) directing, restricting or
limiting, or purporting to direct, restrict or limit, in any manner the
operations of Marked Tree Bancshares or any Marked Tree Bancshares Subsidiary,
including without limitation any restriction on the payment of dividends (other
than such restrictions or limitations generally applicable to banking
institutions as set forth in statutes or regulations of such Regulatory
Authorities) (any such notice, communication, memorandum, agreement or order
described in this sentence is hereinafter referred to as a "Regulatory
Agreement"). Neither Marked Tree Bancshares nor any Marked Tree Bancshares
Subsidiary has consented to or entered into any Regulatory Agreement.

      Section 3.12 Employee Benefit Plans.

      (a) Marked Tree Bancshares Disclosure Schedule 3.12 includes a list of all
existing bonus, incentive, deferred compensation, pension, retirement,
profit-sharing, thrift, savings, employee stock ownership, stock bonus, stock
purchase, restricted stock, stock option, stock appreciation, phantom stock,
severance, welfare and fringe benefit plans, employment, severance and change in
control agreements and all other benefit practices, policies and arrangements
maintained by Marked Tree Bancshares or Marked Tree Bank in which any employee
or former employee, consultant or former consultant or director or former
director of Marked Tree Bancshares or Marked Tree Bank participates or to which
any such employee, consultant or director is a party or is otherwise entitled to
receive benefits, other than plans and programs involving immaterial obligations
(the "Compensation and Benefit Plans"). Neither Marked Tree Bancshares nor
Marked Tree Bank has any commitment to create any additional Compensation and
Benefit Plan or to modify, change or renew any existing Compensation and Benefit
Plan, except as required to maintain the qualified status thereof. Marked Tree
Bancshares has made available to Pocahontas Bancorp true and correct copies of
the Compensation and Benefit Plans.

      (b) Each Compensation and Benefit Plan has been operated and administered
in all material respects in accordance with its terms and with applicable law,
including, but not limited to, ERISA, the IRC, the Age Discrimination in
Employment Act, and any regulations or rules promulgated thereunder, and all
material filings, disclosures and notices required by ERISA, the IRC, the Age
Discrimination in Employment Act and any other applicable law have been timely
made. Except as set forth in Marked Tree Bancshares Disclosure Schedule 3.12(b),
each Compensation and Benefit Plan which is an "employee pension benefit plan"
within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA (a "Pension Plan") and which is
intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code has received a
favorable determination letter from the IRS, or uses a regional prototype
document that has received a favorable determination letter, and Marked Tree
Bancshares is not aware of any circumstances that are reasonably likely to
result in revocation of any such favorable determination letter. There is no
pending or, to the knowledge of


                                      I-13
<PAGE>

Marked Tree Bancshares, threatened action, suit or claim relating to any of the
Compensation and Benefit Plans (other than routine claims for benefits). No
prohibited transaction (which shall mean any transaction prohibited by ERISA
Section 406 and not exempt under ERISA Section 408 or any transaction prohibited
under IRC Section 4975) has occurred within the past six (6) years with respect
to any employee benefit plan maintained by Marked Tree Bancshares or any Marked
Tree Bancshares Subsidiary that would result in the imposition, directly or
indirectly, of an excise tax under IRC Section 4975 or other penalty under ERISA
or the IRC which individually or in the aggregate, has resulted in or will
result in a Material Adverse Effect with respect to Marked Tree Bancshares. The
group health plans maintained by Marked Tree Bancshares and Marked Tree
Bancshares Subsidiaries provide continuation coverage to participants in
accordance with the provisions of IRC Section 4980B(f). Such group health plans
comply in all material respects with Section 1862(b)(1) of the Social Security
Act.

      (c) Neither Marked Tree Bancshares nor Marked Tree Bank have established
or currently or formerly maintain any Compensation and Benefit Plan which is
subject to Title IV of ERISA, or any "single-employer plan" (as defined in
Section 4001(a) of ERISA), and no condition exists that presents a material risk
to Marked Tree Bancshares or any ERISA Affiliate of incurring a liability under
such Title.

      (d) All material contributions required to be made under the terms of any
Compensation and Benefit Plan or any employee benefit arrangements to which
Marked Tree Bancshares or Marked Tree Bank is a party or a sponsor have been
timely made, and all anticipated contributions and funding obligations are
accrued monthly on Marked Tree Bancshares' consolidated financial statements.
Marked Tree Bancshares and its Subsidiaries have expensed and accrued as a
liability the present value of future benefits under each applicable
Compensation and Benefit Plan in accordance with GAAP consistently applied.

      (e) Neither Marked Tree Bancshares nor Marked Tree Bank has any verbal or
written obligations to provide retiree health, life insurance, disability
insurance, or other retiree death benefits under any Compensation and Benefit
Plan, other than benefits mandated by Section 4980B of the Code to be provided
by such Plans.

      (f) With respect to each Compensation and Benefit Plan, if applicable,
Marked Tree Bancshares has provided or made available to Pocahontas Bancorp
copies of the: (A) trust instruments and insurance contracts; (B) most recent
Form 5500 filed with the IRS; (C) most recent actuarial report and financial
statement; (D) the most recent summary plan description; (E) most recent
determination letter issued by the IRS; (F) any Form 5310 or Form 5330 filed
with the IRS; and (G) most recent nondiscrimination tests performed under ERISA
and the Code (including 401(k) and 401(m) tests).

      (g) The consummation of the Company Merger or the Bank Merger will not,
directly or indirectly (including, without limitation, as a result of any
termination of employment or service at any time prior to or following the
Company Merger Effective Date or the Bank Merger Effective Date, as the case may
be) (A) entitle any employee, consultant or director to any payment or benefit
(including severance pay, change in control benefit, or similar compensation) or
any increase in compensation, (B) result in the vesting or acceleration of any
benefits under any Compensation and Benefit Plan or (C) result in any material
increase in benefits payable under any Compensation and Benefit Plan.

      (h) Neither Marked Tree Bancshares nor Marked Tree Bank maintains any
compensation plans, programs or arrangements under which any payment is
reasonably likely to become non-deductible, in whole or in part, for tax
reporting purposes as a result of the limitations under Section 162(m) of the
Code and the regulations issued thereunder.

      (i) The consummation of the Company Merger or the Bank Merger will not,
directly or indirectly (including without limitation, as a result of any
termination of employment or service at any time prior to or following the
Company Merger Effective Date or the Bank Merger Effective Date, as the case may
be), entitle any current or former employee, director or independent contractor
of Marked Tree Bancshares or Marked Tree Bank to any actual or deemed payment
(or benefit) which would constitute a "parachute payment" (as such term is
defined in Section 280G of the Code).

      Section 3.13 Brokers, Finders and Financial Advisors. Neither Marked Tree
Bancshares nor any Marked Tree Bancshares Subsidiary, nor any of their
respective officers, directors, employees or agents, has employed any


                                      I-14

broker, finder or financial advisor in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, or incurred any liability or commitment for any
fees or commissions to any such person in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

      Section 3.14 Environmental Matters. To the knowledge of Marked Tree
Bancshares, neither Marked Tree Bancshares nor any Marked Tree Bancshares
Subsidiary, nor any properties owned or operated by Marked Tree Bancshares or
any Marked Tree Bancshares Subsidiary, has been or is in violation of or liable
under any Environmental Law, which violation or liability, individually or in
the aggregate, has resulted, or will result, in a Material Adverse Effect with
respect to Marked Tree Bancshares and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole. There
are no actions, suits or proceedings, or demands, claims, notices or, to Marked
Tree Bancshares' knowledge, investigations (including without limitation
notices, demand letters or requests for information from any environmental
agency) instituted or pending, or to the knowledge of Marked Tree Bancshares,
threatened, relating to the liability of any property owned or operated by
Marked Tree Bancshares or any Marked Tree Bancshares Subsidiary under any
Environmental Law.

      Section 3.15 Loan Portfolio. The allowance for loan losses reflected, and
to be reflected, in the Marked Tree Bancshares Regulatory Reports, and shown,
and to be shown, on the balance sheets contained in the Marked Tree Bancshares
Financials have been, and will be, established in accordance with the
requirements of GAAP and all applicable regulatory criteria. Marked Tree
Bancshares Disclosure Schedule 3.15 sets forth all loans that are classified by
Marked Tree Bank or any bank regulatory or supervisory authority as "Special
Mention," "Substandard," "Doubtful," "Loss" or "Classified," as of October 31,
2002, together with the aggregate principal amount of and accrued and unpaid
interest on such loans, by category.

      Section 3.16 Information to be Supplied. The information to be supplied by
Marked Tree Bancshares for inclusion in the Registration Statement (including
the Prospectus/Proxy Statement) will not, at the time the Registration Statement
is declared effective pursuant to the Securities Act, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in
order to make the statements therein not misleading. The information supplied,
or to be supplied, by Marked Tree Bancshares for inclusion in the Applications
will, at the time such documents are filed with any Regulatory Authority, be
accurate and complete in all material aspects.

      Section 3.17 Related Party Transactions. Except as disclosed in Marked
Tree Bancshares Disclosure Schedule 3.17, Marked Tree Bancshares is not a party
to any transaction (including any loan or other credit accommodation) with any

Subsidiary). All such transactions (a) were made in the ordinary course of
business, (b) were made on substantially the same terms, including interest
rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable
transactions with other Persons, and (c) did not involve more than the normal
risk of collectibility or present other unfavorable features. No loan or credit
accommodation to any Affiliate of Marked Tree Bancshares is presently in default
or, during the three year period prior to the date of this Agreement, has been
in default or has been restructured, modified or extended. Marked Tree
Bancshares has not been notified that principal and interest with respect to any
such loan or other credit accommodation will not be paid when due or that the
loan grade classification accorded such loan or credit accommodation by Marked
Tree Bancshares is inappropriate.

      Section 3.18 Schedule of Termination Benefits. Marked Tree Bancshares
Disclosure Schedule 3.18 includes a schedule of all termination benefits and
related payments that would be payable to the individuals identified thereon
under any and all employment agreements, special termination agreements,
supplemental executive retirement plans, deferred bonus plans, deferred
compensation plans, salary continuation plans, or any compensation arrangement,
or other pension benefit or welfare benefit plan maintained by Marked Tree
Bancshares solely for the benefit of officers or directors of Marked Tree
Bancshares or Marked Tree Bancshares Subsidiaries (the "Benefits Schedule"),
assuming their employment or service is terminated as of September 30, 2002 and
the Closing Date occurs immediately prior to such termination. No other
individuals are entitled to benefits under any such plans.

      Section 3.19 Loans. Each loan reflected as an asset in the Marked Tree
Bancshares Financial Statements (i) is evidenced by notes, agreements or other
evidences of indebtedness which are true, genuine and correct in all material
respects, (ii) to the extent secured, has been secured by valid liens and
security interests that have been perfected, and (iii) is the legal, valid and
binding obligation of the obligor named therein, enforceable in accordance


                                      I-15
<PAGE>

with its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance and
other laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights
and to general equity principles, in each case other than loans as to which the
failure to satisfy the foregoing standards would not have a Material Adverse
Effect on Marked Tree Bancshares and the Marked Tree Bancshares Subsidiaries
taken as a whole.

      Section 3.20 Anti-takeover Provisions Inapplicable. The transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are not subject to any applicable state
anti-takeover law or regulation.

      Section 5.02 Access; Confidentiality.

      (a) From the date of this Agreement through the Closing Date, Marked Tree

cause each Marked Tree Bancshares Subsidiary or Pocahontas Bancorp Subsidiary to
afford to, the other party and its authorized agents and representatives, access
to their respective properties, assets, books and records and personnel, during
normal business hours and after reasonable notice; and the officers of Marked
Tree Bancshares and Pocahontas Bancorp will furnish any person making such
investigation on behalf of the other party with such financial and operating
data and other information with respect to the businesses, properties, assets,
books and records and personnel as the person making such investigation shall
from time to time reasonably request, provided that such investigation shall be
reasonably related to the transaction contemplated hereby and shall not
interfere unnecessarily with normal operations. None of the parties or their
respective subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose
information where such access or disclosure would violate or prejudice the
rights of their respective customers, jeopardize the attorney-client privilege
of the institution or company in possession or control of such information, or
contravene any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree, fiduciary duty or
binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. The parties
hereto will make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under
circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply. The
parties will hold all such information delivered in confidence to the extent
required by, and in accordance with, the provisions of the Confidentiality
Agreement, dated July 24, 2002, between Marked Tree Bancshares and Pocahontas
Bancorp (the "Confidentiality Agreement").

      (b) Marked Tree Bancshares and Pocahontas Bancorp each agree to conduct

unreasonably with normal operations and customer and employee relationships of
the other party.

      (c) In addition to the access permitted by subparagraph (a) above, from
the date of this Agreement through the Closing Date, Marked Tree Bancshares
shall permit employees of Pocahontas Bancorp reasonable access to information
relating to problem loans, loan restructurings and loan work-outs of Marked Tree
Bancshares.

      (d) If the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall not be
consummated, Marked Tree Bancshares and Pocahontas Bancorp will each destroy or
return all documents and records obtained from the other party or its
representatives, during the course of its investigation and will cause all
information with respect to the other party obtained pursuant to this Agreement
or preliminarily thereto to be kept confidential, except to the extent such
information becomes public through no fault of the party to whom the information
was provided or any of its representatives or agents, and except to the extent
disclosure of any such information is legally required. Marked Tree Bancshares
and Pocahontas Bancorp shall each give prompt written notice to the other party
of any contemplated disclosure where such disclosure is so legally required so
that the other party may seek a protective order or other remedy and/or waive
compliance with this Section 5.02. If in the absence of a protective order or
other remedy or the receipt of a waiver by the other party, a party is
nonetheless, in the written opinion of counsel, legally compelled to disclose
any such confidential information to any tribunal or else stand liable for
contempt or


                                      I-22
<PAGE>

suffer other censure or penalty, a party may, without liability hereunder,
disclose to such tribunal only that portion of the confidential information that
such counsel advises such party is legally required to be disclosed; provided
that such disclosing party uses its best efforts to preserve the confidentiality
of such confidential information, including without limitation, by cooperating
with the other party to obtain an appropriate protective order or other reliable
assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded such confidential
information by such tribunal.

incorporation and bylaws and applicable federal and state law (and Pocahontas
Bancorp shall pay expenses in advance of the final disposition of any such
action or proceeding to each Indemnified Party to the extent permissible under
applicable law and Marked Tree Bancshares' articles of incorporation and bylaws
as in effect on the date hereof; provided, that the person to whom expenses are
advanced provides an undertaking to repay such expenses if it is ultimately
determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification). All rights to
indemnification in respect of a Claim asserted or made within the period
described in the preceding sentence shall continue until the final disposition
of such Claim.

      (b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under Section
5.05(a) hereof, upon learning of any Claim, shall promptly notify Pocahontas
Bancorp, but the failure to so notify shall not relieve Pocahontas Bancorp of
any liability it may have to such Indemnified Party except to the extent that
such failure materially prejudices Pocahontas Bancorp. In the event of any
Claim, (1) Pocahontas Bancorp shall have the right to assume the defense thereof
(with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party) and shall not be
liable to such Indemnified Parties for any legal expenses of other counsel or
any other expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Parties in
connection with the defense thereof, except that, if Pocahontas Bancorp elects
not to assume such defense or counsel for the Indemnified Parties advises that
there are issues which raise conflicts of interest between Pocahontas Bancorp
and the Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel
satisfactory to them, and Pocahontas Bancorp shall pay all reasonable fees and
expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Parties promptly as statements
therefor are received, provided further that Pocahontas Bancorp shall in all
cases be obligated pursuant to this paragraph to pay for only one firm of
counsel for all Indemnified Parties in any one jurisdiction, unless counsel for
any Indemnified Party advises in writing that there are substantive issues


                                      I-24
<PAGE>

which raise conflicts of interest between the Indemnified Parties, (2) the
Indemnified Parties will cooperate in the defense of any such Claim and (3)
Pocahontas Bancorp shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its
prior written consent.

      (c) Pocahontas Bancorp shall use its best efforts to cause the persons
serving as officers and directors of Marked Tree Bancshares immediately prior to
the Company Merger Effective Date to be covered for a period of six years from
the Company Merger Effective Date by the directors' and officers' liability
insurance policy maintained by Marked Tree Bancshares (provided that Pocahontas
Bancorp may substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage and
amounts containing terms and conditions which are not less advantageous than
such policy) with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to the Company
Merger Effective Date that were committed by such officers and directors in
their capacity as such.

      (d) In the event Pocahontas Bancorp or any of its successors or assigns
(1) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not continue or
survive such consolidation or merger, or (2) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each
such case, to the extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of Pocahontas Bancorp assume the obligations set forth in
this Section 5.05.

      (e) The provisions of this Section 5.05 are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and
representatives.

      Section 5.06 No Other Bids and Related Matters. Marked Tree Bancshares
will immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing activities,
discussions or negotiations with any parties with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal (as hereinafter defined), will enforce any confidentiality agreements
and will take the necessary steps to inform the appropriate individuals or
entities referred to in the first sentence of this Section 5.06 of the
obligations undertaken in this Section 5.06. Marked Tree Bancshares agrees that
neither Marked Tree Bancshares nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, and that
Marked Tree Bancshares and its Subsidiaries shall direct and use all reasonable
efforts to cause their respective directors, officers, employees, agents and
representatives (including, without limitation, any investment banker, attorney
or accountant retained by it or any of its subsidiaries) not to, (i) initiate,
solicit or encourage, directly or indirectly, any inquiries or the making or
implementation of any proposal or offer with respect to a merger, acquisition,
consolidation or similar transaction involving, or any purchase of all or any
substantial part of the assets or any equity securities of, Marked Tree
Bancshares or any of its Subsidiaries (any such proposal or offer being
hereinafter referred to as an "Acquisition Proposal"); or (ii) engage in any
discussions or negotiations with, or provide any confidential information or
data to, any Person relating to an Acquisition Proposal, provided however, the
actions described in this clause (ii) are permissible before the Marked Tree
Bancshares stockholders' meeting to approve this Agreement but only to the
extent determined by the Marked Tree Bancshares Board of Directors, in good
faith, after receipt of an opinion from legal counsel that such actions are
required by the Board's fiduciary obligations under applicable law.

      Section 5.07 Duty to Advise; Duty to Update Marked Tree Bancshares'
Disclosure Schedule. Marked Tree Bancshares shall promptly advise Pocahontas
Bancorp of any change or event having a Material Adverse Effect on it or on any
Marked Tree Bancshares Subsidiary or which it believes would or would be
reasonably likely to cause or constitute a material breach of any of its
representations, warranties or covenants set forth herein. Marked Tree
Bancshares shall update Marked Tree Bancshares' Disclosure Schedule as promptly
as practicable after the occurrence of an event or fact which, if such event or
fact had occurred prior to the date of this Agreement, would have been disclosed
in the Marked Tree Bancshares Disclosure Schedule. The delivery of such updated
Schedule shall not relieve Marked Tree Bancshares from any breach or violation
of this Agreement and shall not have any effect for the purposes of determining
the satisfaction of the condition set forth in Section 6.02(c) hereof.

      Section 5.08 Conduct of Pocahontas Bancorp's Business.

      (a) From the date of this Agreement to the Closing Date, Pocahontas
Bancorp will use its best efforts to (x) preserve its business organizations
intact, (y) maintain good relationships with employees, and (z) preserve for
itself the goodwill of customers of FCB. From the date of this Agreement to the
Closing Date, neither Pocahontas Bancorp nor FCB will (i) amend its certificate
of incorporation, charter or bylaws in any manner inconsistent with the prompt
and timely consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii)
issue any equity


                                      I-25
<PAGE>

securities except in connection with the exercise of any employee or director
stock options, (iii) take any action that would result in any of the
representations and warranties of Pocahontas Bancorp or FCB set forth in this
Agreement becoming untrue as of any date after the date hereof or in any of the
conditions set forth in Article VI hereof not being satisfied, except in each
case as may be required by applicable law, or (iv) agree to do any of the
foregoing.

      (b) Except as set forth on Pocahontas Bancorp Disclosure Schedule 5.08(b),
from the date of this Agreement through the Closing Date, Pocahontas Bancorp
will not, nor will it permit FCB to, make or undertake any acquisition of any
company or business that could jeopardize the receipt of the approval of any
Regulatory Authority or materially delay the consummation of the Company Merger
or the Bank Merger, unless the prior written consent of Marked Tree Bancshares
is obtained, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld.

      Section 5.09 Board and Committee Minutes. Marked Tree Bancshares shall
provide to Pocahontas Bancorp within thirty (30) days after any meeting of its
Board of Directors, or any committee thereof, or any senior management
committee, a copy of the minutes of such meeting, except that with respect to

be provided prior to the Closing Date.

      Section 5.10 Undertakings by Pocahontas Bancorp and Marked Tree
Bancshares.

      (a) From and after the date of this Agreement:

            (i) Voting Agreements. Marked Tree Bancshares shall cause each

shares of Marked Tree Bancshares Common Stock to enter into a Stockholder Voting
Agreement, the form of which is attached hereto as Exhibit A, dated as of even
date herewith.

            (ii) Timely Review. If requested by Pocahontas Bancorp at Pocahontas
Bancorp's sole expense, Marked Tree Bancshares shall cause its independent
certified public accountants to perform a review of its unaudited consolidated

Statement of Auditing Standards No. 36, and to issue their report on such
financial statements as soon as is practicable thereafter;

            (iii) Outside Service Bureau Contracts. If requested to do so by
Pocahontas Bancorp, Marked Tree Bancshares shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain an extension of any contract with an outside service bureau or

            (iv) Board Meetings. Marked Tree Bancshares shall respond reasonably
and in good faith to any request of Pocahontas Bancorp to permit a
representative of Pocahontas Bancorp, who is reasonably acceptable to Marked
Tree Bancshares, to attend any meeting of Marked Tree Bancshares' Board of
Directors or the Executive Committee thereof, but only as a non-voting observer,
and not as a participant of any meeting; provided, however, that the attendance
of such representative shall not be permitted (i) at any meeting, or portion
thereof, for the sole purpose of discussing the transaction contemplated by this
Agreement or the obligations of Marked Tree Bancshares or Marked Tree Bank under
this Agreement, or (ii) during the course of any meeting upon the determination
of the Board of Directors (following consultation with legal counsel) that such
attendance would be in violation of the directors' fiduciary duties;

            (v) List of Nonperforming Assets. Marked Tree Bancshares shall
provide Pocahontas Bancorp, within ten (10) days of the end of each calendar
month, a written list of nonperforming assets (the term "nonperforming assets,"

15, "Accounting by Debtors and Creditors for Troubled Debt Restructuring," (ii)
loans on nonaccrual, (iii) real estate owned, (iv) all loans ninety (90) days or

to Marked Tree Bancshares from and after the


                                      I-26
<PAGE>

Closing Date) and Pocahontas Bancorp's plans with respect to the conduct of the
business of Marked Tree Bancshares following the Company Merger and otherwise to
reflect merger-related expenses and costs incurred by Marked Tree Bancshares;
provided, however, that Marked Tree Bancshares shall not be required to take
such action unless Pocahontas Bancorp agrees in writing that all conditions to
closing set forth in Section 6.02 hereof have been satisfied or waived (except
for the expiration of any applicable waiting periods), and further provided that
any such adjustments shall not reduce Marked Tree Bancshares' stated book value
for the purpose of calculating the Exchange Ratio. Prior to the delivery by
Pocahontas Bancorp of the writing referred to in the preceding sentence, Marked
Tree Bancshares shall provide Pocahontas Bancorp a written statement, certified
without personal liability by the chief executive officer of Marked Tree
Bancshares and dated the date of such writing, that the representation made in
Section 3.15 hereof is true as of such date or, alternatively, setting forth in
detail the circumstances that prevent such representation from being true as of
such date; and no accrual or reserve made by Marked Tree Bancshares or any
Marked Tree Bancshares Subsidiary pursuant to this subsection, or any litigation
or regulatory proceeding arising out of any such accrual or reserve, shall
constitute or be deemed to be a breach or violation of any representation,
warranty, covenant, condition or other provision of this Agreement or to
constitute a termination event within the meaning of Section 7.01(b) hereof; and

            (vii) Stockholders' Meeting. Marked Tree Bancshares shall submit

preparation and filing, as soon as practicable, of (A) the Applications, (B) the
Registration Statement and related filings under state securities laws covering
the Pocahontas Bancorp Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Company Merger,
(C) all other documents necessary to obtain any other approvals and consents
required to effect the completion of the Company Merger and the Bank Merger, and
(D) all other documents contemplated by this Agreement; or

            (ii) Public Announcements. Cooperate and cause its respective
officers, directors, employees and agents to cooperate in good faith, consistent
with their respective legal obligations, in the preparation and distribution of,
and agree upon the form and substance of, any press release related to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, and any other public
disclosures related thereto, including without limitation communications to
Marked Tree Bancshares stockholders, Marked Tree Bancshares' internal
announcements and customer disclosures, but nothing contained herein shall
prohibit either party from making any disclosure which its counsel deems
necessary, provided that the disclosing party notifies the other party
reasonably in advance of the timing and contents of such disclosure.

      Section 5.11 Employee and Termination Benefits; Directors and Management.

      (a) Employee Benefits. Marked Tree Bancshares and/or Marked Tree Bank, as
applicable, shall have taken all actions necessary to cause the termination of
all Compensation and Benefit Plans, effective as of the Company Merger Effective
Date. Except as specifically noted in this Section 5.11, employees of Marked
Tree Bancshares or Marked Tree Bank who continue as employees of Pocahontas
Bancorp or FCB after the Company Merger Effective Date ("Continuing Employees")
shall receive credit for service with Marked Tree Bancshares or Marked Tree Bank
(for purposes of eligibility and vesting determination but not for benefit
accrual purposes) under any similar existing Pocahontas Bancorp benefit plan or
new Pocahontas Bancorp benefit plan in which such employees or their dependents
would be eligible to enroll, on the same basis as it provides coverage to
employees of Pocahontas Bancorp and FCB except that any pre-existing condition,
eligibility waiting period or other limitations and exclusions otherwise
applicable under such plans to new employees shall not apply to such employees
or their covered dependents who were covered under a similar Marked Tree Bank
plan on the Company Merger Effective Date. Such service shall also apply for
purposes of satisfying any waiting periods, actively-at-work requirements and
evidence of insurability requirements.


                                      I-27
<PAGE>

      (b) Pocahontas Bancorp shall make available to Continuing Employees and
their dependents employer-provided health coverage on the same basis as it
provides such coverage to employees of Pocahontas Bancorp or FCB. Unless a
Continuing Employee affirmatively terminates coverage under a Marked Tree
Bancshares health plan prior to the time that such Continuing Employee becomes
eligible to participate in the Pocahontas Bancorp health plan, no coverage of
any of the Continuing Employees or their dependents shall terminate under any of
the Marked Tree Bancshares health plans prior to the time such Continuing
Employees and their dependents become eligible to participate in the health
plans, programs and benefits common to all employees of Pocahontas Bancorp or
FCB and their dependents. Continuing Employees whose employment is terminated
and qualified beneficiaries will have the right to continue coverage under group
health plans of Pocahontas Bancorp and/or Pocahontas Bancorp Subsidiaries in
accordance with Code Section 4980B(f). Continuing Employees who become covered
under a Pocahontas Bancorp health plan shall be required to satisfy the
deductible limitations of the Pocahontas Bancorp health plan for the plan year
in which the coverage commences, without offset for deductibles satisfied under
the Marked Tree Bancshares health plan.

      (c) FCB shall cause its Board of Directors to be expanded by two members
and Pocahontas Bancorp shall cause Daniel Hatzenbuehler and Ritter Arnold to be
appointed to FCB's Board of Directors immediately following the Bank Merger
Effective Date. In the event that an appointee is unable to serve as a director
of FCB as a result of illness, death, resignation or any other reason,
Pocahontas Bancorp and Marked Tree Bancshares promptly shall mutually agree on a
substitute appointee to serve as a member of the Board of Directors of FCB.

      (d) All employees of Marked Tree Bancshares or Marked Tree Bank on the
Closing Date shall be offered employment with Pocahontas Bancorp or FCB;
provided, the respective titles and responsibilities of such Continuing
Employees may be changed by Pocahontas Bancorp, in its discretion.

      Section 5.12 Duty to Advise; Duty to Update Pocahontas Bancorp's
Disclosure Schedule. Pocahontas Bancorp shall promptly advise Marked Tree
Bancshares of any change or event having a Material Adverse Effect on it or on
any Pocahontas Bancorp Subsidiary or which it believes would or would be
reasonably likely to cause or constitute a material breach of any of its
representations, warranties or covenants set forth herein. Pocahontas Bancorp
shall update Pocahontas Bancorp's Disclosure Schedules as promptly as
practicable after the occurrence of an event or fact which, if such event or
fact had occurred prior to the date of this Agreement, would have been disclosed
in the Pocahontas Bancorp Disclosure Schedule. The delivery of such updated
Schedule shall not relieve Pocahontas Bancorp from any breach or violation of
this Agreement and shall not have any effect for the purposes of determining the
satisfaction of the condition set forth in Sections 6.01(c) hereof.

      Section 5.13 Affiliate Letter. Marked Tree Bancshares shall use its best
efforts to cause to be delivered to Pocahontas Bancorp within fifteen business
days after the date of this Agreement the Letter Agreement attached hereto as
Exhibit 5.13, executed by each director, executive officer or other Affiliate of
Marked Tree Bancshares.

      Section 5.14 Operation of Branches. Pocahontas Bancorp will not close or
relocate any Marked Tree Bank branch office ("Marked Tree Branch") in connection
with the Bank Merger, and such offices will continue to be operated and will be
operated under the trade name "Marked Tree Bank" for such period following the
Closing Date as Pocahontas Bancorp deems advisable in its sole discretion to
facilitate a smooth transition for Marked Tree Bank customers. Pocahontas
Bancorp will offer the full range of banking services currently available at FCB
full-service offices at the Marked Tree Branches. The provisions of this Section
5.14 shall be subject to the requirements of the Regulatory Authorities.

      (a) By the mutual written consent of the parties hereto; or

      (b) By Pocahontas Bancorp or Marked Tree Bancshares:

            (i) if there shall have been any breach of any representation,

of Marked Tree Bancshares which results in a Material Adverse Effect with
respect to Marked Tree Bancshares, on the other hand, and such breach cannot be,
or shall not have been, remedied within thirty (30) days after receipt by such

requesting that it be remedied;

            (ii) if the Closing Date shall not have occurred on or before July

            (iii) if either party has been informed in writing by a Regulatory
Authority whose approval or consent has been requested that such approval or

perform or observe its agreements set forth herein required to be performed or
observed by such party on or before the Closing Date; or

            (iv) if the approval of the stockholders of Marked Tree Bancshares

      Section 8.01 Expenses.

      (a) Subject to Section 7.03 of this Agreement, each party hereto shall
bear and pay all costs and expenses incurred by it in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, including fees and expenses of its own
financial consultants, accountants and counsel.

      (b) In the event of any termination of this Agreement by a party pursuant
to Section 7.01(b)(i) hereof based on a breach of a representation or warranty,
or the breach of a covenant, by the other party hereto, the breaching party
shall pay to the non-breaching party all out-of-pocket costs and expenses,
including, without limitation, reasonable legal and accounting fees and
expenses, incurred by the non-breaching party in connection with entering into
this Agreement and carrying out of any and all acts contemplated hereunder;
provided, however, that this clause shall not be construed to relieve or release
a breaching party from any additional liabilities or damages arising out of its
willful breach of any provision of this Agreement.

      Section 8.02 Non-Survival of Representations and Warranties. All
representations, warranties and, except to the extent specifically provided
otherwise herein, agreements and covenants shall terminate on the Closing Date.

Agreement, (ii) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or
other acts of either party hereto, (iii) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties contained herein or in any document delivered
pursuant hereto, or (iv) waive compliance with any of the agreements or
conditions contained in Articles V and VI hereof or otherwise. This Agreement
may not be amended except by an instrument in writing authorized by the
respective Boards of Directors and signed, by duly authorized officers, on
behalf of the parties hereto. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing
signed by a duly authorized officer on behalf of such party, but such waiver or
failure to insist on strict compliance with such obligation, covenant, agreement
or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any
subsequent or other failure.

      (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
prior to the Company Merger Effective Date, Pocahontas Bancorp shall be entitled
to revise the structure of the Company Merger, the Bank Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby provided, that (i) there are no
material adverse federal or state income tax consequences to Marked Tree
Bancshares' stockholders as a result of the modification; (ii) the consideration
to be paid to the holders of the shares of Marked Tree Bancshares Common Stock
under this Agreement is not thereby changed in kind or reduced in amount; (iii)
there are no material adverse changes to the benefits and other arrangements
provided to or on behalf of Marked Tree Bancshares' and Marked Tree Bank's
directors, officers and other employees; and (iv) such modification will not be
likely to delay materially or jeopardize receipt of any required regulatory
approvals or other consents and approvals relating to the consummation of the
Company Merger and the Bank Merger. This Agreement and any related documents
shall be appropriately amended in order to reflect any such revised structure.

      Section 8.04 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, including the documents and
other writings referred to herein or delivered pursuant hereto, including the
Confidentiality Agreement, contains the entire agreement and understanding of
the parties with respect to its subject matter. This Agreement supersedes all
prior arrangements and understandings between the parties, both written or oral
with respect to its subject matter. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of
and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective successors;
provided, however, that nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, is
intended to confer upon any party, other than the parties hereto and their
respective successors, any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities.

rights or obligations hereunder to any other person, without the prior written

           Section 4-26-1007 of the Arkansas Business Corporation Act

      4-26-1007. Rights of dissenting shareholders.

      (a) If a shareholder of a corporation which is a party to a merger or
consolidation files with the corporation, prior to or at the meeting of
shareholders at which the plan of merger or consolidation is submitted to a
vote, a written objection to the plan of merger or consolidation and does not
vote in favor thereof, and the shareholder within ten (10) days after the date
on which the vote was taken makes written demand on the surviving or new
domestic or foreign corporation for payment of the fair value of his shares as
of the day prior to the date on which the vote was taken approving the merger or
consolidation, then, if the merger or consolidation is effected, the surviving
or new corporation shall pay to the shareholder, upon surrender of his
certificate or certificates representing the shares, the fair value thereof.

      (b) The demand shall state the number and class of the shares owned by the
dissenting shareholder.

      (c) Any shareholder failing to make demand within the ten-day period shall
be bound by the terms of the merger or consolidation.

      (d) Within ten (10) days after the merger or consolidation is effected,
the surviving or new corporation, as the case may be, shall give notice to each
dissenting shareholder who has made demand as herein provided for the payment of
the fair value of his shares.

      (e)(1) If within thirty (30) days after the date on which the merger or
consolidation was effected the value of such shares is agreed upon between the
dissenting shareholder and the surviving or new corporation, payment shall be
made within ninety (90) days after the date on which such merger or
consolidation was effected, upon the surrender of his certificate or
certificates representing those shares.

      (e)(2) Upon payment of the agreed value, the dissenting shareholder shall
cease to have any interest in those shares or in the corporation.

      (f)(1) If within the period of thirty (30) days the shareholder and the
surviving or new corporation do not so agree, then the dissenting shareholder,
within sixty (60) days after the expiration of the thirty-day period, may file a
petition in the circuit court of the county in which the registered office of
the surviving corporation is located, if the surviving corporation is a domestic
corporation or in the Pulaski County Circuit Court if the surviving corporation
is a foreign corporation, asking for a finding and determination of the fair
value of the shares and shall be entitled to judgment against the surviving or
new corporation for the amount of the fair value as of the day prior to the date
on which the vote was taken approving such merger or consolidation, together
with interest thereon to the date of the judgment.

      (f)(2) The judgment shall be payable only upon and simultaneously with the
surrender to the surviving or new corporation of the certificate or certificates
representing the shares.

      (f)(3) Upon payment of the judgment, the dissenting shareholder shall
cease to have any interest in the shares or in the surviving or new corporation.

      (f)(4) Unless the dissenting shareholder files the petition within the
time herein limited, the shareholder and all persons claiming under him shall be
bound by the terms of the merger or consolidation.

      (g) Shares acquired by the surviving or new corporation pursuant to the
payment of the agreed value thereof or to payment of the judgment entered, as in
this section provided, may be held and disposed of by the corporation as in the
case of other treasury shares.

      (h) The provisions of this section shall not apply to a merger if, on the
date of the filing of the articles of merger, the surviving corporation is the
owner of all the outstanding shares of the other domestic or foreign
corporations that are parties to the merger.
