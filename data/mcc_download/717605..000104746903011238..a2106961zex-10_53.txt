and one director shall be designated by LXH II; (ii) the Investors are permitted
to designate two Investor Directors pursuant to this Agreement, one director
shall be designated by GS Capital and one director shall be designated by LXH

     (c)  If, for any reason, all of the Investor Directors designated pursuant
to Section 2.02 and this Section 2.03 are not elected to the Board by
stockholders, then Hexcel shall exercise all authority under applicable law to
cause any person designated by the Investors to be elected to the Board, and
during any such absence of membership on the Board, Hexcel shall, after
receiving notice from the Investors as to the identity of a representative of
the Investors, (i) permit such representative to attend all Board meetings and
to the extent contemplated by Section 2.04 all committees thereof as an

including such meeting's time and place, at the same time and in the same manner
as such notice is provided to the members of the Board (or such committee
thereof); (iii) provide such representative with copies of all materials,
including notices, minutes and consents, distributed to the members of the Board
(or such committee thereof) at the same time as such materials are distributed

Hexcel as such representative would have had as an Investor Director; and (iv)
on a basis consistent with the members of the Board, permit such representative

          SECTION 2.04    COMMITTEE MEMBERSHIP. So long as the Investors shall
be entitled to designate two or more Investor Nominees for election to the Board
under this Agreement, the finance, compensation, nominating, audit and any other
committee of the Board shall consist of at least one Investor Director;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if no Investor Director is eligible for membership on an
above-listed committee under then-applicable listing standards of the NYSE or
any other applicable law, rule or regulation, then such committee of the Board
shall include an Investor Director only when so permitted by the listing
standards of the NYSE or any other applicable law, rule or regulation; PROVIDED,
FURTHER, that Hexcel shall exercise all authority under applicable law, rule and
regulation to permit the inclusion of any Investor Director designated by the
Investors on such committee, including, without limitation, causing an increase
in the number of directors on such committee. To the extent that Investor
Directors are not eligible for membership on the finance committee, compensation
committee, nominating committee, audit committee and/or other committees of the
Board, the Investors shall be entitled to designate a representative to attend
and observe such committee meetings, provided that the observation is not
prohibited by applicable listing standards, laws, rules or regulations.

          SECTION 2.05    RESIGNATIONS AND REPLACEMENTS. (a) If at any time a
member of the Board resigns (pursuant to this Section 2.05 or otherwise) or is
removed in accordance with applicable law or Hexcel's by-laws, a new member
shall be designated to replace such member until the next election of directors.
If consistent with Section 2.02 the replacement director is to be an Investor
Director, the party that designated such Investor Director shall designate the
replacement Investor Director. Except as set forth in paragraph (c) below, if
consistent with Section 2.02, the replacement director is to be a Non-Investor
Director, such Non-Investor Director (including the Chairman of the Board if he
or she is a Non-Investor Director) shall be designated in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement.

     (b)  Subject to paragraph (c) below, if at any time the number of Investor
Nominees entitled to be nominated to the Board in accordance with this Agreement
in an election of directors presented to stockholders would decrease, within 10
days thereafter the Investors shall cause a sufficient number of Investor
Directors to resign from the Board so that the number of Investor Directors on
the Board after such resignation(s) equals the number of Investor Nominees that
the Investors would have been entitled to designate had an election of directors
taken place at such time. The

                                       15
<Page>

Investors shall also cause a sufficient number of Investor Directors to resign
from any relevant committees of the Board so that such committees are comprised
in the manner contemplated by Section 2.04 after giving effect to such
resignations. Any vacancies created by the resignations required by this Section
2.05(b) shall be filled by Independent Directors.

     (c)  If at any time the percentage of the Total Voting Power of Hexcel
Beneficially Owned by the Investors decreases as a result of an issuance of
Voting Securities by Hexcel (other than any of the issuances described in the
last sentence of this Section 2.05(c)), the Investors may notify Hexcel that the
Investors intend to acquire a sufficient amount of additional Voting Securities
in accordance with this Agreement necessary to maintain their then current level
of Board representation within 90 days. In such event, until the end of such
period (and thereafter if the Investors in fact restore their percentage of the
Total Voting Power of Hexcel during such period and provided that the Investors
continue to maintain the requisite level of Beneficial Ownership of Voting
Securities in accordance with Section 2.02) the Board shall continue to have the
number of Investor Directors that corresponds to the percentage of the Total
Voting Power of Hexcel Beneficially Owned by the Investors prior to such
issuance of Voting Securities by Hexcel. Notwithstanding any provision herein to
the contrary, the provisions of this Section 2.05(c) shall not apply to any
issuances of Voting Securities (x) upon conversion of any convertible securities
which are either outstanding on the date hereof (including, without limitation,
issuances of securities upon any payment of dividends on, redemption of, or
otherwise payable with respect to the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock or
Series B Convertible Preferred Stock) or approved by the Board or a duly
authorized committee of the Board after the date hereof in accordance with
Section 2.06 hereof, or (y) pursuant to employee or director stock option or
incentive compensation or similar plans outstanding as of the date hereof or,
subsequent to the date hereof, approved by the Board or a duly authorized
committee of the Board.

          SECTION 2.06    INVESTOR DIRECTOR APPROVALS. The Board shall not

of a majority of the Investor Directors for so long as and at any time the
Investors Beneficially Own 15% or more of the Total Voting Power of Hexcel
(subject to the provisions of Section 2.02(d)), and, if the Investors percentage
Beneficial Ownership of the Total Voting Power of Hexcel is reduced below 15% by
an issuance of Voting Securities by Hexcel, no such authorization, approval, or
ratification shall be given by the Board without the approval of a majority of
the

                                       16

Investors in writing of such issuance, and (y) if the Investors shall have
notified Hexcel within 10 business days after their receipt of a written
notification of such issuance that the Investors, pursuant to the option granted
to the Investors by Section 3.02 of this Agreement, intend to acquire a
sufficient amount of Voting Securities within such 90-day period referred to
therein, so that the Investors will Beneficially Own at least 15% of the Total
Voting Power of Hexcel by the end of such 90-day period, subject to Section
2.05(c), during the 90-day period following an issuance of Voting Securities by
Hexcel that causes the Investors to Beneficially Own less than 15% of the Total
Voting Power of Hexcel:

          (i)    any merger, consolidation, acquisition or other business
     combination involving Hexcel or any Subsidiary of Hexcel (other than a
     Buyout Transaction) if the value of the consideration to be paid or
     received by Hexcel and/or its stockholders in any such individual
     transaction or in such transaction when added to the aggregate value of the
     consideration paid or received by Hexcel and/or its stockholders in all
     other such transactions approved by the Board during the immediately
     preceding 12 months exceeds the greater of (x) $75 million or (y) 11% of
     Hexcel's total consolidated assets;

          (ii)   any sale, transfer, assignment, conveyance, lease or other
     disposition or any series of related dispositions of any assets, business

     Transaction) if the value of the assets, business or operations so disposed
     during the immediately preceding 12 months exceeds the greater of (x) $75
     million or (y) 11% of Hexcel's total consolidated assets; or

          (iii)  any issuance by Hexcel or any Significant Subsidiary of Hexcel

     customary employee or director stock option or incentive compensation or
     similar plans approved by the Board or a duly authorized committee of the
     Board, (2) pursuant to transactions solely among Hexcel and its wholly
     owned Subsidiaries (including any Subsidiaries which would be wholly owned
     by Hexcel but for the issuance of directors' or shareholders' qualifying
     shares), (3) upon conversion of convertible securities or upon exercise of
     warrants or options, which convertible securities, warrants or options are
     either outstanding on the date of this Agreement (including, without

     consideration received by Hexcel for such transactions during the
     immediately preceding 12 months exceeds $25 million.

          SECTION 2.07    BOARD OF DIRECTOR APPROVALS. Subject to Section 3.03,
if applicable, for so long as there are any Investor Directors serving on the
Board, the Board shall not authorize, approve or ratify any action (a "Board
Action"), at a meeting of the Board, by written consent or otherwise, without
the approval of a minimum of six (6) members of the Board, of which at least two
(2) of such six (6) members shall be Independent Directors, or in the event that
the Board shall consist of less than six (6) members due to vacancies on the
Board, the approval of all members of the Board shall be required for any Board

     (b) In any election of directors or at any meeting of the stockholders of
Hexcel called expressly for the removal of directors, for so long as the Board

establishing a quorum and shall vote all their Voting Securities entitled to
vote (1) in favor of any nominee or director selected in accordance with Section

                                       18
<Page>

agreement, existing on the date hereof, between Hexcel and a holder or holders
of Voting Securities. Except as provided above and in Section 3.03, the
Investors shall be free to vote in their sole discretion all their Voting
Securities entitled to vote on any other matter submitted to or acted upon by
stockholders; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Investors shall vote against any
amendment to Hexcel's certificate of incorporation with respect to the
directors' and officers' indemnification provisions contained therein which
would adversely affect the rights thereunder of the Indemnified Individuals at
any time prior to such vote, except for such modifications as are required by

MEASURES. (a) Hexcel shall cause the amendment of its by-laws to reflect the
provisions of Article II of this Agreement and such other matters as the parties
may reasonably agree. The form of such amended by-laws is attached hereto as
Exhibit A. For so long as the Investors are entitled to designate an Investor
Nominee pursuant to Section 2.02, those by-laws reflecting the provisions of
Article II of this Agreement shall not thereafter be amended during the term of
this Agreement except with the Investors' written consent. Hexcel and each of
the Investors shall each take or cause to be taken all lawful action necessary
to ensure at all times that Hexcel's certificate of incorporation and by-laws
are not at any time inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement.

     (b)  Except with the Investors' prior written consent, Hexcel shall not
cause or permit any amendment, restatement, modification or change to, or waiver
of, any provision contained in any agreement (other than customary employee or
director stock option or incentive compensation or similar plans approved by the
Board or a duly authorized committee of the Board) between a stockholder or
stockholders and Hexcel that provides such stockholder or stockholders (1)
governance rights, board representation rights, voting rights, transfer

Securities held by such holder or holders or (2) registration rights with
respect to Voting Securities held by such holder or holders.

     (c)  Except as required by applicable law, rule or regulation, Hexcel shall
not approve or recommend to its stockholders any transaction or approve,
recommend or take any other action (other than those expressly contemplated by
this Agreement and other than those that affect the Investors and each Other
Holder or each director at the same time in the same manner) that would (1)
materially adversely

                                       19
<Page>

discriminate against the Investors as stockholders of Hexcel or (2) restrict the
right of any Investor Director to vote on any matter as such director believes
appropriate in light of his or her duties as a director or the manner in which
an Investor Director may participate in his or her capacity as a director in

except with respect to (i) entering into contractual or other business
relationships with any of the Investors or any of their Affiliates (other than
in their capacity as stockholders of Hexcel), (ii) disputes with any of the
Investors or any of their Affiliates (including disputes under this Agreement),
(iii) interpretation or enforcement of this Agreement or any other agreement
with the Investors or any of their Affiliates or (iv) any other matter involving
an actual or potential conflict of interest due to such director's relationship
with the Investors or any of their Affiliates. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Hexcel may adopt or implement any takeover defense measures applicable to the
Investors or any of their Affiliates, including the institution or amendment by
Hexcel or any of its Subsidiaries of any stockholders rights plan or similar
plan or device, or any change of control matters (including provisions in future
agreements or collaborations), PROVIDED, that such takeover defense measures
shall not restrict the rights of the Investors to acquire any Voting Securities
pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement.

(ix) take any action challenging the validity or enforceability of the foregoing
or (x) assist, advise, encourage or negotiate with any Person with respect to,
or seek to do, any of the foregoing.

Investors from responding to any inquiries from any shareholders of Hexcel as to
the Investors' intention with respect to the voting of any Voting Securities
Beneficially Owned by such Investors so long as such response is consistent with

                                       21
<Page>

Agreement; (ii) restrict the right of each Investor Director on the Board or any

time (it being understood and agreed that the Investors shall not object to any
extension of Hexcel's exclusivity period and shall not initiate or otherwise
support any proceeding to terminate or shorten the length of Hexcel's
exclusivity period).

          SECTION 3.02    INVESTORS RIGHT TO MAINTAIN POSITION. In addition to
the rights set forth in Sections 2.05(c) and 2.06 hereof, Hexcel hereby grants
to the Investors the following irrevocable option:

     If, at any time after the Closing Date for so long as the Investors shall

the Investors shall have the option, for a period of 45 days after receipt of
such notice, to purchase from Hexcel an Amount (as defined below) of such Voting
Securities for the same consideration per security and on the same terms as were

such issuance (other than Additional Shares).
