                          (NON-QUALIFIED STOCK OPTION)

     This stock option agreement ("AGREEMENT") is made to be effective as of May
9, 2002, by and between the COMPANY and _________________(the "OPTIONEE"). Terms
in appearing in bold capital  letters  shall have the meanings as defined in the
Peoples Bancorp Inc. 2002 Stock Option Plan (the "PLAN").

                                   WITNESSETH:

     Whereas, the BOARD OF DIRECTORS adopted the PLAN on February 14, 2002; and

     Whereas,  the shareholders of the COMPANY,  upon the  recommendation of the
BOARD, approved the PLAN at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders held on April 11,
2002; and

     Whereas,  pursuant to the provisions of the PLAN, the COMMITTEE  determined
that a STOCK  OPTION to acquire  SHARES of the COMPANY  should be granted to the
OPTIONEE;

     Now, Therefore,  in consideration of the premises,  the parties hereto make
the following agreements, intending to be legally bound thereby:

         Section 1      Grant of STOCK OPTION.

     The  COMPANY  hereby  grants to the  OPTIONEE  a STOCK  OPTION to  purchase
____________________SHARES  of the COMPANY. This STOCK OPTION is not intended to
qualify as an incentive STOCK OPTION under Section 422 of the CODE.

         Section 2      Terms and Conditions of the STOCK OPTION.

          (A) Exercise  Price.  The exercise price to be paid by the OPTIONEE to
     the COMPANY upon the exercise of the STOCK OPTION shall be $27.25 per SHARE
     (the "EXERCISE PRICE"), subject to further adjustment as provided herein.

          (B) Exercise of the STOCK OPTION. The STOCK OPTION may be exercised in
     full on or after May 9, 2005, subject to Section 2(C) below.

     In the  event of a  CHANGE  IN  CONTROL,  the  STOCK  OPTION  shall  become
exercisable in full,  whether or not then exercisable by its terms,  immediately
upon consummation of the CHANGE IN CONTROL.

     The grant of this STOCK OPTION shall not confer upon the OPTIONEE any right
to continue as an  employee of the COMPANY or any  SUBSIDIARY,  nor limit in any
way the right of the COMPANY or the shareholders of the COMPANY to terminate his
status  as an  employee  in  accordance  with  law  or the  governing  corporate
documents of the COMPANY.

          (C)  STOCK  OPTION  Term.  This  STOCK  OPTION  shall  in no  event be
     exercisable  after the  expiration  of ten (10) years from the date of this
     AGREEMENT.

          (D) Method of  Exercise.  To the extent that it is  exercisable,  this
     STOCK OPTION may be exercised by mailing or  delivering  to the COMMITTEE a
     written notice of exercise,  signed by the OPTIONEE, or in the event of the
     death of the OPTIONEE,  by such other person as is entitled to exercise the
     STOCK  OPTION.  The notice of exercise  shall state the number of SHARES in
     respect of which the STOCK OPTION is being  exercised,  and shall either be
     accompanied  by the payment of the full EXERCISE  PRICE of such SHARES,  or
     shall  fix a date  (not  more  than 10  business  days from the date of the
     notice)  for the  payment of the full  EXERCISE  PRICE of the SHARES  being
     purchased.  The EXERCISE  PRICE may be paid in cash,  or by the transfer by
     the OPTIONEE to the COMPANY of free and clear SHARES  already  owned by the
     OPTIONEE and having a FAIR MARKET  VALUE on the exercise  date equal to the
     EXERCISE PRICE, or by a combination of cash and SHARES already owned by the
     OPTIONEE  equal in the aggregate to the EXERCISE PRICE for the SHARES being
     purchased.

         Section 3      Adjustments  and  Changes  in the  SHARES  subject  to
the STOCK OPTION.

     In the event  there is any change in SHARES  resulting  from stock  splits,
stock dividends,  combinations or exchanges of shares,  or other similar capital
adjustments,  the number of SHARES subject to the STOCK OPTION, and the EXERCISE
PRICE of the SHARES, shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect such change.

         Section 4      Non-Assignability of the STOCK OPTION.

     This STOCK OPTION may not be transferred or assigned other than (i) by will
or the  laws of  descent  and  distribution,  or (ii)  pursuant  to a  qualified
domestic  relations  order (as  defined  in  Section  401(a)(13)  of the CODE or
Section  206(d)(3) of the Employee  Retirement  Income  Security Act of 1974, as
amended.  Subject to the  foregoing,  during the lifetime of the OPTIONEE,  this
STOCK OPTION may be exercised only by the OPTIONEE,  the OPTIONEE's guardian, or
the OPTIONEE's legal representative.

         Section 5      Exercise After OPTIONEE Ceases to be an Employee.

          (A) If the  OPTIONEE  terminates  employment  with the  COMPANY or any
     SUBSIDIARY  due to (a) Death;  (b) DISABILITY and the employee has at least
     three (3) years of continuous  service;  or (c) Retirement and the employee
     has at least ten (10) years of  continuous  service;  then the STOCK OPTION
     granted to the  OPTIONEE  under this  Agreement  may be  exercised in full,
     whether or not then  exercisable by its terms,  on or before the earlier of
     (i) expiration of the term of the STOCK OPTION,  or (ii) twelve (12) months
     after the date the OPTIONEE ceases to be an employee.

          (B)  If the  OPTIONEE  voluntarily  ceases  to be an  employee  of the
     COMPANY or any  SUBSIDIARY,  then only the STOCK OPTION subject to exercise
     immediately  prior to the  termination  may be  exercised  on or before the
     earlier of (i)  expiration of the term of the STOCK OPTION,  or (ii) twelve
     (12) months after the date the OPTIONEE ceases to be an employee.

          (C) If the  OPTIONEE  ceases to be an  employee  of the COMPANY or any
     SUBSIDIARY due to Cause,  all unexercised  STOCK OPTIONS shall  immediately
     terminate.

         Section 6      Restrictions on Exercise.

     Anything   contained  in  this  AGREEMENT  or  elsewhere  to  the  contrary
notwithstanding:

          registered by description, by coordination or by qualification,  or at
          such  time are the  subject  matter  of a  transaction  which has been
          registered by description,  all in accordance with Chapter 1707 of the
          Ohio Revised Code, as amended; and

     thereafter,  is an  affiliate  of the  COMPANY  for  purposes  of Rule  144
     promulgated  under  the ACT,  or are  sold  and  issued  in  reliance  upon
     exemptions under the securities laws of any state,  then upon such sale and
     issuance:

               (i) Such SHARES shall not be  transferable by the holder thereof,
          and neither the COMPANY nor its transfer  agent or registrar,  if any,
          shall be  required  to  register  or  otherwise  to give effect to any
          transfer thereof and may prevent any such transfer, unless the COMPANY
          shall have received an opinion from its counsel to the effect that any
          such transfer would not violate the ACT or the applicable  laws of any
          state; and

               (ii) The  COMPANY  may cause  each  certificate  evidencing  such
          SHARES to bear a legend reflecting the applicable  restrictions on the
          transfer thereof.

     OPTION has been  exercised  may bear such  legends  and  statements  as the
     COMPANY shall deem advisable to insure  compliance with applicable  federal
     and state laws and regulations.

          (D)  Nothing  contained  in  this  AGREEMENT  or  elsewhere  shall  be
     construed to require the COMPANY to take any action  whatsoever to make the
     STOCK OPTION  exercisable or to make  transferable any SHARES purchased and
     issued upon the exercise of the STOCK OPTION.

         Section 7      Rights of the OPTIONEE as a Shareholder.
