upon  such  assumption,  make  available  to the  Borrower  the  amount  of such

the Administrative Agent and the Borrower.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no
event may (i) the expiration  date of any Letter of Credit extend beyond the L/C
Termination  Date, (ii) any Letter of Credit have initial  duration in excess of
one year, or (iii) any Letter of Credit contain an automatic  renewal  provision
which (x) would  allow  such  Letter of Credit to be  renewed  more  often  than
annually or (y) would allow,  after giving  effect to all renewal  periods,  the
expiration  date of such Letter of Credit to extend  beyond the L/C  Termination
Date.  The  initial  Stated  Amount of each  Letter of Credit  shall be at least
$500,000.

     Requests  for Issuance of Letters of Credit.  The  Borrower  shall give the
Administrative Agent written notice at least five (5) Business Days prior to the
requested  date of  issuance  of a Letter of Credit,  such notice to describe in
reasonable  detail the proposed terms of such Letter of Credit and the nature of
the  transactions  or  obligations  proposed to be  supported  by such Letter of
Credit,  and in any event shall set forth with  respect to such Letter of Credit
(i) the  proposed  initial  Stated  Amount,  (ii)  the  beneficiary,  and  (iii)
expiration  date.  The Borrower  shall also  execute and deliver such  customary
applications  and agreements for standby  letters of credit,  and other forms as
requested from time to time by the Administrative  Agent.  Provided the Borrower
has given the notice  prescribed by the first  sentence of this  subsection  and
delivered such application and agreements referred to in the preceding sentence,
subject to the other  terms and  conditions  of this  Agreement,  including  the
satisfaction of any applicable conditions precedent set forth in Article VI, the
Administrative Agent shall issue the requested Letter of Credit on the requested
date of issuance for the benefit of the stipulated  beneficiary  but in no event
prior to the date five (5)  Business  Days  following  the date after  which the
Administrative  Agent has received all of the items  required to be delivered to
it under  this  subsection.  Upon  the  written  request  of the  Borrower,  the
Administrative  Agent shall  deliver to the Borrower a copy of (i) any Letter of
Credit proposed to be issued  hereunder  prior to the issuance  thereof and (ii)
each issued Letter of Credit within a reasonable time after the date of issuance
thereof.  To the extent any term of a Letter of Credit  Document is inconsistent
with a term of any Loan Document, the term of such Loan Document shall control.

     Reimbursement  Obligations.  Upon receipt by the Administrative  Agent from
the  beneficiary  of a Letter of Credit of any  demand  for  payment  under such
Letter of Credit, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower of
the amount to be paid by the Administrative Agent as a result of such demand and
the  date on which  payment  is to be made by the  Administrative  Agent to such
beneficiary  in  respect  of  such  demand.   The  Borrower  hereby  absolutely,
unconditionally  and irrevocably  agrees to pay and reimburse the Administrative
Agent for the amount of each demand for  payment  under such Letter of Credit at
or prior to the date on which payment is to be made by the Administrative  Agent
to the beneficiary  thereunder,  without presentment,  demand,  protest or other
formalities of any kind. Upon receipt by the Administrative Agent of any payment
in respect of any  Reimbursement  Obligation,  the
                                       32
<PAGE>
Administrative  Agent shall  promptly  pay to each  Lender  that has  acquired a
participation  therein under the second sentence of Section 2.2(i) such Lender's
Pro Rata Share of such payment.

     Manner of  Reimbursement.  Upon its receipt of a notice  referred to in the
immediately   preceding   subsection   (d),  the   Borrower   shall  advise  the
Administrative  Agent whether or not the Borrower intends to borrow hereunder to
finance its obligation to reimburse the  Administrative  Agent for the amount of
the related  demand for payment  and, if it does,  the  Borrower  shall submit a
timely Notice of Borrowing as provided in Section 2.1(b).  If the Borrower fails
to so advise the Administrative Agent, or if the Borrower fails to reimburse the
Administrative  Agent for a demand for  payment  under a Letter of Credit by the
date of such payment, then (i) if the applicable conditions contained in Article
VI would permit the making of Revolving  Loans,  the Borrower shall be deemed to
have  requested a borrowing of Revolving  Loans (which shall be Base Rate Loans)
in an amount equal to the unpaid Reimbursement Obligation and the Administrative
Agent shall give each Lender prompt  notice of the amount of the Revolving  Loan
to be made available to the  Administrative  Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. and
(ii) if such  conditions  would not permit the making of  Revolving  Loans,  the
provisions of subsection (j) of this Section shall apply.

     Effect of  Letters  of  Credit on  Commitments.  Upon the  issuance  by the
Administrative  Agent of any Letter of Credit  and until  such  Letter of Credit
shall have expired or been  terminated,  the  Commitment of each Lender shall be
deemed to be utilized for all  purposes of this  Agreement in an amount equal to
the  product  of (i) such  Lender's  Pro Rata  Share and (ii) the sum of (A) the
Stated  Amount  of such  Letter  of Credit  plus (B) any  related  Reimbursement
Obligations then outstanding.

     Administrative  Agent's Duties Regarding  Letters of Credit;  Unconditional
Nature  of  Reimbursement   Obligation.  In  examining  documents  presented  in
connection  with drawings under Letters of Credit and making payments under such
Letters of Credit against such documents, the Administrative Agent shall only be
required  to use the  same  standard  of care  as it  uses  in  connection  with
examining  documents  presented in  connection  with  drawings  under letters of
credit in which it has not sold  participations  and making  payments under such
letters of credit.  The Borrower assumes all risks of the acts and omissions of,
or misuse of the  Letters  of Credit by, the  respective  beneficiaries  of such
Letters  of Credit.  In  furtherance  and not in  limitation  of the  foregoing,
neither the Administrative Agent nor any of the Lenders shall be responsible for
(i) the form, validity,  sufficiency,  accuracy, genuineness or legal effects of
any document  submitted by any party in connection  with the application for and
issuance of or any drawing  honored under any Letter of Credit even if it should
in fact prove to be in any or all respects  invalid,  insufficient,  inaccurate,
fraudulent  or  forged;  (ii) the  validity  or  sufficiency  of any  instrument
transferring  or  assigning  or  purporting  to transfer or assign any Letter of
Credit, or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in
part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason; (iii) failure
of the  beneficiary  of any  Letter of Credit to comply  fully  with  conditions
required in order to draw upon such Letter of Credit;  (iv)  errors,  omissions,
interruptions  or delays in transmission  or delivery of any messages,  by mail,
cable,  telex,  telecopy  or  otherwise,  whether or not they be in cipher;  (v)
errors  in  interpretation  of  technical  terms;  (vi) any loss or delay in the
transmission  or otherwise  of any document  required in order to make a drawing
under any Letter of Credit, or of the proceeds thereof; (vii) the
                                       33
<PAGE>
misapplication by the beneficiary of any Letter of Credit, or of the proceeds of
any drawing under any Letter of Credit; or (viii) any consequences  arising from
causes beyond the control of the  Administrative  Agent or the Lenders.  None of
the  above  shall  affect,   impair  or  prevent  the  vesting  of  any  of  the
Administrative  Agent's rights or powers hereunder.  Any action taken or omitted
to be taken by the  Administrative  Agent under or in connection with any Letter
of Credit,  if taken or omitted in the  absence of gross  negligence  or willful
misconduct,  shall not create against the Administrative  Agent any liability to
the Borrower or any Lender.  In this connection,  the obligation of the Borrower
to reimburse the  Administrative  Agent for any drawing made under any Letter of
Credit  shall be  absolute,  unconditional  and  irrevocable  and  shall be paid
strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or any other  applicable
Letter of Credit Document under all circumstances whatsoever,  including without
limitation,   the  following   circumstances:   (A)  any  lack  of  validity  or
enforceability  of any  Letter  of  Credit  Document  or any term or  provisions
therein;  (B) any amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure from all or
any of the Letter of Credit Documents;  (C) the existence of any claim,  setoff,
defense or other  right  which the  Borrower  may have at any time  against  the
Administrative  Agent, any Lender,  any beneficiary of a Letter of Credit or any
other  Person,  whether in  connection  with this  Agreement,  the  transactions
contemplated  hereby  or in the  Letter  of Credit  Documents  or any  unrelated
transaction;  (D) any breach of contract or dispute  between the  Borrower,  the
Administrative Agent, any Lender or any other Person; (E) any demand,  statement
or any other document  presented  under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged,
fraudulent,  invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement  therein or
made  in  connection  therewith  being  untrue  or  inaccurate  in  any  respect
whatsoever;  (F) any  non-application  or misapplication by the beneficiary of a
Letter of Credit or of the proceeds of any drawing  under such Letter of Credit;
(G)  payment by the  Administrative  Agent  under the  Letter of Credit  against
presentation  of a draft or certificate  which does not strictly comply with the
terms of the Letter of Credit;  and (H) any other act, omission to act, delay or
circumstance  whatsoever  that might,  but for the  provisions  of this Section,
constitute  a legal or  equitable  defense  to or  discharge  of the  Borrower's
Reimbursement Obligations.

     Amendments, Etc. The issuance by the Administrative Agent of any amendment,
supplement or other modification to any Letter of Credit shall be subject to the
same conditions  applicable  under this Agreement to the issuance of new Letters
of Credit  (including,  without  limitation,  that the request  therefor be made
through the Administrative  Agent),  and no such amendment,  supplement or other
modification  shall be issued unless either (i) the respective  Letter of Credit
affected thereby would have complied with such conditions had it originally been
issued  hereunder in such  amended,  supplemented  or modified  form or (ii) the
Requisite  Lenders shall have  consented  thereto.  In connection  with any such
amendment, supplement or other modification, the Borrower shall pay the fees, if
any, payable under the last sentence of Section 3.6(e).

     Lenders' Participation in Letters of Credit.  Immediately upon the issuance
by the Administrative  Agent of any Letter of Credit each Lender shall be deemed
to have absolutely,  irrevocably and unconditionally purchased and received from
the Administrative  Agent,  without recourse or warranty,  an undivided interest
and participation to the extent of such Lender's Pro Rata Share of the liability
of the  Administrative  Agent  with  respect  to such  Letter of Credit and each
Lender thereby shall  absolutely,  unconditionally  and irrevocably  assume,  as
primary
                                       34
<PAGE>
obligor  and not as  surety,  and  shall  be  unconditionally  obligated  to the
Administrative Agent to pay and discharge when due, such Lender's Pro Rata Share
of the  Administrative  Agent's  liability  under  such  Letter  of  Credit.  In
addition,  upon the  making of each  payment  by a Lender to the  Administrative
Agent in respect of any Letter of Credit pursuant to the  immediately  following
subsection (j), such Lender shall,  automatically and without any further action
on  the  part  of  the  Administrative  Agent  or  such  Lender,  acquire  (i) a
participation in an amount equal to such payment in the Reimbursement Obligation
owing to the  Administrative  Agent by the Borrower in respect of such Letter of
Credit and (ii) a participation  in a percentage equal to such Lender's Pro Rata
Share in any  interest or other  amounts  payable by the  Borrower in respect of
such Reimbursement Obligation (other than the Fees payable to the Administrative
Agent pursuant to the last sentence of Section 3.6(e)).

     Payment  Obligation of Lenders.  Each Lender severally agrees to pay to the
Administrative  Agent on demand in  immediately  available  funds in Dollars the
amount  of  such   Lender's   Pro  Rata  Share  of  each  drawing  paid  by  the
Administrative  Agent  under each  Letter of Credit to the extent such amount is
not reimbursed by the Borrower  pursuant to Section  2.2(d).  Each such Lender's
obligation  to  make  such  payments  to the  Administrative  Agent  under  this
subsection,  and the Administrative  Agent's right to receive the same, shall be
absolute,  irrevocable and unconditional and shall not be affected in any way by
any circumstance  whatsoever,  including without limitation,  (i) the failure of
any other Lender to make its payment under this  subsection,  (ii) the financial
condition  of the Borrower or any other Loan Party,  (iii) the  existence of any
Default or Event of Default, including any Event of Default described in Section
11.1(e) or Section 11.1(f) or (iv) the termination of the Commitments. Each such
payment to the Administrative Agent shall be made without any offset, abatement,
withholding or deduction whatsoever.

     Information to Lenders.  Promptly following any change in Letters of Credit
outstanding,  the  Administrative  Agent  shall  deliver to each  Lender and the
Borrower  a notice  describing  the  aggregate  amount of all  Letters of Credit
outstanding at such time.  Upon the request of any Lender from time to time, the
Administrative Agent shall deliver any other information reasonably requested by
such Lender with respect to each Letter of Credit then  outstanding.  Other than
as set forth in this subsection,  the Administrative Agent shall have no duty to
notify the Lenders  regarding the issuance or other matters regarding Letters of
Credit issued hereunder.  The failure of the Administrative Agent to perform its
requirements  under  this  subsection  shall not  relieve  any  Lender  from its
obligations under Section 2.2(j).

     Swingline Loans.
     ----------------

     Swingline  Loans.  Subject to the terms and  conditions  hereof,  including
without  limitation  Section 2.14, the Swingline Lender agrees to make Swingline
Loans  to the  Borrower,  during  the  period  from  the  Effective  Date to but
excluding the Swingline  Termination  Date, in an aggregate  principal amount at
any one time outstanding up to, but not exceeding,  $25,000,000,  as such amount
may be reduced from time to time in accordance with the terms hereof.  If at any
time the aggregate  principal amount of the Swingline Loans  outstanding at such
time exceeds the Swingline Commitment in effect at such time, the Borrower shall
immediately pay the Administrative Agent for the account of the Swingline Lender
the  amount  of  such  excess.
                                       35
<PAGE>
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,  the Borrower may borrow,
repay and reborrow Swingline Loans hereunder.

     Procedure  for  Borrowing  Swingline  Loans.  The  Borrower  shall give the
Administrative  Agent and the Swingline Lender notice either  telephonically  or
pursuant to a Notice of Swingline Borrowing, in the form of Exhibit D-2 attached
hereto,  delivered  no  later  than  9:00  a.m.  on the  proposed  date  of such
borrowing.  Any such  telephonic  notice  shall  include all  information  to be
specified  in a written  Notice of  Swingline  Borrowing,  and shall be followed
promptly by delivery from Borrower of a completed Notice of Swingline Borrowing.
Not later  than  11:00  a.m.  on the date of the  requested  Swingline  Loan and
subject to satisfaction of the applicable conditions set forth in Article VI for
such borrowing,  the Swingline  Lender shall make the proceeds of such Swingline
Loan available to the Borrower in Dollars,  in immediately  available  funds, at
the account specified by the Borrower in the Notice of Swingline Borrowing.

     Interest.  Swingline Loans shall bear interest at a per annum rate equal to
the Base Rate as in effect  from time to time or at such  other rate or rates as
the  Borrower and the  Swingline  Lender may agree from time to time in writing.
All accrued and unpaid interest on Swingline Loans shall be payable on the dates
and in the manner  provided in Section 2.5 with respect to interest on Base Rate
Loans  (except as the Swingline  Lender and the Borrower may otherwise  agree in
writing in connection with any particular Swingline Loan).

     Swingline  Loan Amounts,  Etc. Each  Swingline Loan shall be in the minimum
amount of $500,000 and integral multiples of $100,000 in excess thereof, or such
other minimum  amounts agreed to by the Swingline  Lender and the Borrower.  Any
voluntary  prepayment  of a  Swingline  Loan must be in  integral  multiples  of
$100,000 or the aggregate  principal  amount of all outstanding  Swingline Loans
(or such other minimum amounts upon which the Swingline  Lender and the Borrower
may agree) and in connection  with any such  prepayment,  the Borrower must give
the Swingline Lender prior written notice thereof no later than 2:00 p.m. on the
day prior to the date of such prepayment. Voluntary prepayments of any Swingline
Loan shall not be subject to any penalty or premium  (with the  exception of any
breakage fee associated  therewith).  The Swingline  Loans shall, in addition to
this Agreement, be evidenced by the Swingline Note.

     Repayment and Participations of Swingline Loans.
     ------------------------------------------------

     The Borrower  agrees to repay each Swingline Loan within three (3) Business
Days of demand therefor by the Swingline Lender and, in any event,  within seven
(7) Business Days after the date such Swingline  Loan was made.  Notwithstanding
the foregoing,  the Borrower shall repay the entire outstanding principal amount
of, and all accrued but unpaid interest on, the Swingline Loans on the Swingline
Termination  Date (or such earlier date as the Swingline Lender and the Borrower
may agree in writing).

     If (A), as of 10:00 a.m.  on the sixth (6th)  Business  Day  following  the
funding of a  particular  Swingline  Loan,  Borrower  has neither (1) repaid the
Swingline Loan in full,  notified the Swingline  Lender in writing that Borrower
intends to repay  such  Swingline  Loan in full on the next  Business  Day,  nor
timely  delivered a Notice of Borrowing  requesting  a proposed  funding date no
later than the seventh  (7th)  Business Day after such  Swingline  funding date,
with respect
                                       36
<PAGE>
to a Revolving  Loan in a principal  amount  sufficient to repay such  Swingline
Loan  in full or (B),  as of  11:00  a.m.  on the  seventh  (7th)  Business  Day
following  the funding of a particular  Swingline  Loan  Borrower has not repaid
such  Swingline  Loan in  full  or the  conditions  precedent  to any  requested
Revolving  Loan the  proceeds  of which  were to have  been used (in whole or in
part) to repay such Swingline Loan have not been  satisfied,  or (C) at any time
prior to the repayment of any Swingline Loan, an Event of Default shall exist or
the Loan shall be  accelerated,  then,  in lieu of  demanding  repayment  of any
outstanding  Swingline  Loan from the  Borrower,  the  Swingline  Lender may, on
behalf of the Borrower (which hereby irrevocably directs the Swingline Lender to
act on its  behalf),  request a borrowing of Base Rate Loans from the Lenders in
an amount equal to the principal balance of such Swingline Loan.

     The  limitations  contained  in  Section  3.5(a)  shall  not  apply  to any
borrowing of Base Rate Loans made  pursuant to this  subsection.  The  Swingline
Lender shall give notice to the  Administrative  Agent of any such  borrowing of
Base Rate Loans not later than 11:00 a.m. at least one Business Day prior to the
proposed date of such borrowing.

     Each  Lender  will  make  available  to  the  Administrative  Agent  at the
Principal  Office  for the  account  of the  Swingline  Lender,  in  immediately
available  funds,  the proceeds of the Base Rate Loan to be made by such Lender.
The  Administrative  Agent shall pay the proceeds of such Base Rate Loans to the
Swingline Lender, which shall apply such proceeds to repay such Swingline Loan.

     If the Lenders are  prohibited  from making Loans required to be made under
this subsection for any reason  whatsoever,  including without  limitation,  the
occurrence  of any of the  Defaults or Events of Default  described  in Sections
11.1(e) or 11.1(f),  each  Lender  shall  purchase  from the  Swingline  Lender,
without  recourse or warranty,  an undivided  interest and  participation to the
extent of such  Lender's  Pro Rata Share of such  Swingline  Loan,  by  directly
purchasing a participation  in such Swingline Loan in such amount and paying the
proceeds  thereof to the  Administrative  Agent for the account of the Swingline
Lender in Dollars and in immediately  available funds. A Lender's  obligation to
purchase  such a  participation  in a  Swingline  Loan  shall  be  absolute  and
unconditional  and  shall  not  be  affected  by  any  circumstance  whatsoever,
including without limitation, (i) any claim of setoff, counterclaim, recoupment,
defense or other right  which such Lender or any other  Person may have or claim
against the  Administrative  Agent,  the  Swingline  Lender or any other  Person
whatsoever, (ii) the occurrence or continuation of a Default or Event of Default
(including  without  limitation,  any of  the  Defaults  or  Events  of  Default
described in Sections  11.1(e) or 11.1(f),  or the  termination  of any Lender's
Commitment,  (iii) the existence (or alleged existence) of an event or condition
which has had or could have a Material  Adverse  Effect,  (iv) any breach of any
Loan Document by the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the Borrower or (v) any
other circumstance, happening or event whatsoever, whether or not similar to any
of the foregoing.  If such amount is not in fact made available to the Swingline
Lender by any Lender,  the  Swingline  Lender  shall be entitled to recover such
amount on demand from such Lender,  together with accrued  interest  thereon for
each day from the date of demand thereof, at the Federal Funds Rate.

     If such  Lender  does  not pay such  amount  forthwith  upon the  Swingline
Lender's demand therefor,  and until such time as such Lender makes the required
payment,  the Swingline  Lender
                                       37
<PAGE>
shall be deemed to continue to have outstanding Swingline Loans in the amount of
such unpaid  participation  obligation  for all  purposes of the Loan  Documents
(other  than  those  provisions  requiring  the  other  Lenders  to  purchase  a
participation  therein).  Further,  such Lender shall be deemed to have assigned
any and all payments made of principal and interest on its Loans,  and any other
amounts due it hereunder, to the Swingline Lender to fund Swingline Loans in the
amount of the  participation  in  Swingline  Loans  that such  Lender  failed to
purchase  pursuant to this Section  until such amount has been  purchased  (as a
result of such assignment or otherwise).

     Bid Rate Loans.
     ---------------

     Bid Rate Loans. In addition to borrowings of Revolving Loans but subject to
the  limitations  of  Section  2.13,  at any time  during  the  period  from the
Effective Date to but excluding the  Termination  Date, the Borrower may, as set
forth in this Section, request the Lenders to make offers to make Bid Rate Loans
to the  Borrower in Dollars,  in an aggregate  principal  amount at any one time
outstanding up to, but not exceeding,  $150,000,000.  The Lenders may, but shall
have no obligation  to, make such offers and the Borrower may, but shall have no
obligation to, accept any such offers in the manner set forth in this Section.

     Requests for Bid Rate Loans.  When the Borrower in its discretion wishes to
request  from the  Lenders  offers  to make Bid Rate  Loans,  it shall  give the
Administrative Agent notice (a "Bid Rate Quote Request") so as to be received no
later than 9:00 a.m. on (x) the Business Day  immediately  preceding the date of
borrowing proposed therein,  in the case of an Absolute Rate Auction and (y) the
date four (4) Business Days prior to the proposed date of borrowing, in the case
of a LIBOR Auction. The Administrative Agent shall deliver to each Lender a copy
of  each  Bid  Rate  Quote  Request   promptly  upon  receipt   thereof  by  the
Administrative Agent. The Borrower may request offers to make Bid Rate Loans for
up to three (3) different  Interest  Periods in each Bid Rate Quote Request (for
which purpose Interest  Periods in different  lettered clauses of the definition
of the term "Interest  Period" shall be deemed to be different  Interest Periods
even if they are  coterminous);  provided  that the  request  for each  separate
Interest  Period shall be deemed to be a separate  Bid Rate Quote  Request for a
separate  borrowing (a "Bid Rate Borrowing").  Each Bid Rate Quote Request shall
be  substantially  in the form of Exhibit  K-1 and shall  specify as to each Bid
Rate Borrowing all of the following:

     the  proposed  date of such Bid Rate  Borrowing,  which shall be a Business
Day;

     the aggregate amount of such Bid Rate Borrowing which shall be in a minimum
amount of $5,000,000  and integral  multiples of  $1,000,000  in excess  thereof
which  shall  not  cause  any of the  limits  specified  in  Section  2.13 to be
violated;

     whether the Bid Rate Quote  Request is for LIBOR  Margin  Loans or Absolute
Rate Loans; and

     the duration of the Interest  Period  applicable  thereto,  which shall not
extend beyond the Termination Date.

     The Borrower shall not deliver more than one (1) Bid Rate Quote Requests in
any calendar week.
                                       38
<PAGE>
     Bid Rate Quotes.
     ----------------

     Each  Lender  may submit to the  Administrative  Agent one or more Bid Rate
Quotes,  each containing an offer to make a Bid Rate Loan in response to any Bid
Rate Quote  Request;  provided  that,  if the  Borrower's  request under Section
2.4(b)  specified more than one Interest  Period,  such Lender may make a single
submission  containing  only one Bid Rate Quote for each such  Interest  Period.
Each Bid Rate Quote must be submitted to the Administrative Agent not later than
7:30 a.m. (x) on the proposed date of borrowing, in the case of an Absolute Rate
Auction and (y) on the date three  Business  Days prior to the proposed  date of
borrowing, in the case of a LIBOR Auction, and in either case the Administrative
Agent shall disregard any Bid Rate Quote received after such time; provided that
the Lender then acting as the  Administrative  Agent may submit a Bid Rate Quote
only if it notifies the Borrower of the terms of the offer contained therein not
later than  thirty  (30)  minutes  prior to the latest time by which the Lenders
must submit  applicable Bid Rate Quotes.  Subject to Articles VI and XI, any Bid
Rate Quote so made shall be irrevocable.  Such Bid Rate Loans may be funded by a
Lender's  Designated  Lender (if any) as provided in Section 13.6(d);  provided,
such Lender shall not be required to specify in its Bid Rate Quote  whether such
Bid Rate Loan will be funded by such Designated Lender.

     Each Bid Rate Quote made by a Lender shall be  substantially in the form of
Exhibit K-2 and shall specify:

     the proposed date of borrowing and the Interest Period therefor;

               the  principal  amount of the Bid Rate  Loan for which  each such
               offer is being made; provided that the aggregate principal amount
               of all Bid Rate Loans for which a Lender  submits Bid Rate Quotes
               (x) may be greater or less than the Commitment of such Lender but
               (y)  shall  not  exceed  the  principal  amount  of the Bid  Rate
               Borrowing for a particular  Interest Period for which offers were
               requested;

               in the case of an Absolute Rate Auction, the rate of interest per
               annum (rounded upwards, if necessary, to the nearest 1/1,000th of
               1%)  offered  for each such  Absolute  Rate  Loan (the  "Absolute
               Rate");

               in the  case  of a LIBOR  Auction,  the  margin  above  or  below
               applicable LIBOR (the "LIBOR Margin") offered for each such LIBOR
               Margin  Loan,  expressed  as a percentage  (rounded  upwards,  if
               necessary,  to the  nearest  1/1,000th  of 1%) to be added to (or
               subtracted from) the applicable LIBOR;

               the identity of the quoting Lender; and

               any Bid Rate Quote shall be in a minimum amount of $5,000,000 and
               integral multiples of $1,000,000 in excess thereof.

          No Bid Rate Quote shall  contain  qualifying,  conditional  or similar
          language or propose terms other than or in addition to those set forth
          in the applicable  Bid Rate Quote Request



                                       39

          and,  in  particular,  no  Bid  Rate  Quote  may be  conditioned  upon
          acceptance by the Borrower of all (or some  specified  minimum) of the
          principal amount of the Bid Rate Loan for which such Bid Rate Quote is
          being made.

     Notification by Administrative  Agent. The  Administrative  Agent shall, as
promptly  as  practicable  after the Bid Rate Quotes are  submitted  (but in any
event not later than 8:30 a.m. (x) on the  proposed  date of  borrowing,  in the
case of an Absolute Rate Margin and (y) on the date three Business Days prior to
the proposed  date of  borrowing,  in the case of a LIBOR  Auction),  notify the
Borrower of the terms (i) of any Bid Rate Quote submitted by a Lender that is in
accordance  with  Section  2.4(c) and (ii) of any Bid Rate  Quote  that  amends,
modifies or is otherwise  inconsistent  with a previous Bid Rate Quote submitted
by such  Lender  with  respect  to the  same Bid Rate  Quote  Request.  Any such
subsequent  Bid Rate Quote  shall be  disregarded  by the  Administrative  Agent
unless such subsequent Bid Rate Quote is submitted  solely to correct a manifest
error in such former Bid Rate Quote.  The  Administrative  Agent's notice to the
Borrower  shall  specify  (A) the  aggregate  principal  amount  of the Bid Rate
Borrowing for which offers have been received and (B) the principal  amounts and
Absolute Rates or LIBOR Margins, as applicable, so offered by each Lender.

     Acceptance by Borrower.
     -----------------------

     Not later than 9:30 a.m. (x) on the proposed date of borrowing, in the case
of an Absolute Rate Margin and (y) on the date three  Business Days prior to the
proposed date of borrowing,  in the case of LIBOR  Auction,  the Borrower  shall
notify the Administrative Agent of its acceptance or nonacceptance of the offers
so notified to it pursuant to Section  2.4(d)  which notice shall be in the form
of Exhibit  K-3.  In the case of  acceptance,  such  notice  shall  specify  the
aggregate principal amount of offers for each Interest Period that are accepted.
The failure of the  Borrower  to give such notice by such time shall  constitute
nonacceptance  of the relevant  Bid Rate Quote.  The Borrower may accept any Bid
Rate Quote in whole or in part; provided, that:

               the aggregate principal amount of each Bid Rate Borrowing may not
               exceed the  applicable  amount set forth in the  related Bid Rate
               Quote Request;

               the aggregate  principal  amount of each Bid Rate Borrowing shall
               comply with the  provisions of Section  2.4(b)(ii)  but shall not
               cause the limits specified in Section 2.13 to be violated;

               acceptance  of  offers  may be made  only in  ascending  order of
               Absolute  Rates or LIBOR  Margins,  as  applicable,  in each case
               beginning with the lowest rate so offered;

               any  acceptance  in part by the  Borrower  shall be in a  minimum
               amount of  $5,000,000  and integral  multiples of  $1,000,000  in
               excess thereof; and

               the  Borrower  may not accept any offer that fails to comply with
               Section 2.4(c) or otherwise fails to comply with the requirements
               of this Agreement.

                                       40
<PAGE>
     If offers are made by two or more Lenders with the same  Absolute  Rates or
LIBOR Margins, as applicable,  for a greater aggregate principal amount than the
amount in respect of which offers are accepted for the related  Interest Period,
the  principal  amount of Bid Rate Loans in  respect  of which  such  offers are
accepted  shall be allocated by the  Administrative  Agent among such Lenders in
proportion to the aggregate  principal amount of such offers.  Determinations by
the Administrative Agent of the amounts of Bid Rate Loans shall be conclusive in
the absence of manifest error.

     Obligation to Make Bid Rate Loans. The Administrative  Agent shall promptly
(and in any  event  not  later  than (x)  10:00  a.m.  on the  proposed  date of
borrowing of Absolute  Rate Loans and (y) on the date three  Business Days prior
to the proposed date of borrowing of LIBOR Margin Loans) notify each Lender that
submitted a Bid Rate Quote as to whose Bid Rate Quote has been  accepted and the
amount and rate  thereof.  A Lender who is notified that it has been selected to
make a Bid Rate Loan may designate its  Designated  Lender (if any) to fund such
Bid Rate Loan on its behalf,  as  described  in Section  13.6(d) Any  Designated
Lender  which funds a Bid Rate Loan shall on and after the time of such  funding
become the obligee  under such Bid Rate Loan and be entitled to receive  payment
thereof  when due. No Lender shall be relieved of its  obligation  to fund a Bid
Rate Loan, and no Designated  Lender shall assume such obligation,  prior to the
time the applicable Bid Rate Loan is funded.  Any Lender whose offer to make any
Bid Rate Loan has been  accepted  shall,  not later than 11:00 a.m.  on the date
specified for the making of such Loan, make the amount of such Loan available to
the Administrative Agent at its Principal Office in immediately available funds,
for the account of the Borrower.  The Administrative Agent shall, subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, make the amount so received available to
the Borrower not later than 12:00 noon on such date by  depositing  the same, in
immediately  available  funds,  in an account of the Borrower  designated by the
Borrower.

     No Effect on Commitment. Except for the purpose and to the extent expressly
stated in Section 2.14, the amount of any Bid Rate Loan made by any Lender shall
not constitute a utilization of such Lender's Commitment.

     Rates and Payment of Interest on Loans.
     ---------------------------------------

     Rates.  The Borrower  promises to pay to the  Administrative  Agent for the
account of each Lender interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Loan made
by such Lender for the period from and  including the date of the making of such
Loan to but excluding the date such Loan shall be paid in full, at the following
per annum rates:

     during such periods as such Loan is a Base Rate Loan,  at the Base Rate (as
in effect from time to time);

     during such  periods as such Loan is a LIBOR  Loan,  at LIBOR for such Loan
for the Interest Period therefor, plus the Applicable Margin for LIBOR Loans;

                                       41
<PAGE>

     during such periods as such Loan is a Swingline  Loan, at the Base Rate (as
in effect from time to time) or such other rate as Borrower and Swingline Lender
may agree from time to time in writing for such Swingline Loan; and

     during such  periods as such Loan is a Bid Rate Loan,  (A) at the  Absolute
Rate (as in effect  from  time to time),  in the case of each such Bid Rate Loan
which is an Absolute Rate Loan,  and (B) at LIBOR for such Bid Rate Loan for the
Interest Period therefor,  plus the applicable LIBOR Margin, in the case of each
such Bid Rate Loan which is a LIBOR Margin Loan.

Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  during the  continuance of an Event of Default,
the  Borrower  shall pay to the  Administrative  Agent for the  account  of each
Lender interest at the Post-Default Rate on the outstanding  principal amount of
any Loan made by such Lender, on all Reimbursement  Obligations and on any other
amount payable by the Borrower  hereunder or under the Notes held by such Lender
to or for the account of such Lender (including without limitation,  accrued but
unpaid interest to the extent permitted under Applicable Law).

     Payment of  Interest.  All accrued and unpaid  interest on the  outstanding
principal  amount of each Loan  shall be payable  (i)  monthly in arrears on the
first day of each month, commencing with the first full calendar month occurring
after the Effective Date and (ii) on any date on which the principal  balance of
such Loan is due and payable in full (whether at maturity,  due to  acceleration
or otherwise).  Interest payable at the Post-Default  Rate shall be payable from
time to time on demand.  All  determinations by the  Administrative  Agent of an
interest rate  hereunder  shall be conclusive and binding on the Lenders and the
Borrower for all purposes, absent manifest error.

     Number of Interest Periods.
     ---------------------------

        There  may  be  no  more  than  eight  (8)  different  Interest  Periods
outstanding at the same time,  whether in the context of a LIBOR Loan which is a
Revolving Loan or a LIBOR Loan which is a Bid Rate Loan.

     Repayment of Loans.
     -------------------

        The Borrower shall repay the entire outstanding principal amount of, and
all accrued but unpaid interest on, the Revolving Loans on the Termination  Date
and the Bid Rate Loans on their respective applicable due dates.

     Prepayments.
     ------------

        Optional.  Subject to Sections  3.5 and 5.4, the Borrower may prepay any
Loan at any time  without  premium  or  penalty.  The  Borrower  shall  give the
Administrative  Agent at least three (3) Business Days prior  written  notice of
the  prepayment of any Loan,  and  Administrative  Agent shall  promptly  notify
Lenders thereafter.

                                       42
<PAGE>
     Mandatory.
     ----------

        Commitment Overadvance. If at any time the aggregate principal amount of
all  outstanding  Loans,  together  with the  aggregate  amount of all Letter of
Credit  Liabilities,  exceeds the Total  Commitment  Amount,  the Borrower shall
immediately upon demand pay to the Administrative  Agent for the ratable benefit
of the Lenders, the amount of such excess.

        Unencumbered  Pool Overadvance.  If at any time the aggregate  principal
amount of all  outstanding  Loans,  together  with the  aggregate  amount of all
Letter of Credit  Liabilities,  exceeds the Maximum  Availability,  the Borrower
shall within five (5) days of the Borrower obtaining knowledge of the occurrence
of any such excess,  deliver to the Administrative Agent for prompt distribution
to each Lender a written plan acceptable to all of the Lenders to eliminate such
excess.  If such  excess  is not  eliminated  within  fifteen  (15)  days of the
Borrower  obtaining  knowledge  of  the  occurrence  thereof,  then  the  entire
outstanding  principal balance of all Loans,  together with all accrued interest
thereon,  and an amount  equal to all Letter of Credit  Liabilities  for deposit
into the  Letter of Credit  Collateral  Account,  shall be  immediately  due and
payable in full.

        Bid Loan Overadvance.  If at any time the aggregate  principal amount of
all  outstanding Bid Rate Borrowings  exceeds  $150,000,000,  the Borrower shall
immediately upon demand pay to the  Administrative  Agent for the account of the
applicable Lenders, the amount of such excess.

        All  payments  under  this  subsection  (b) shall be  applied to pay all
amounts  of  excess  principal  outstanding  on the  applicable  Loans  and  any
applicable  Reimbursement  Obligations  in accordance  with Section 3.2, and the
remainder,  if any,  shall be  deposited  into the  Letter of Credit  Collateral
Account for application to any Reimbursement Obligations as and when due.

     Continuation.
     -------------

        So long as no Default or Event of Default  exists,  the  Borrower may on
any Business Day,  with respect to any LIBOR Loan,  elect to maintain such LIBOR
Loan or any portion  thereof as a LIBOR Loan by selecting a new Interest  Period
for such LIBOR Loan.  Each new Interest Period selected under this Section shall
commence on the last day of the  immediately  preceding  Interest  Period.  Each
selection of a new Interest  Period shall be made by the Borrower  giving to the
Administrative  Agent a Notice of  Continuation  not later than 9:00 a.m. on the
third  Business Day prior to the date of any such  Continuation.  Such notice by
the Borrower of a  Continuation  shall be by  telephone  or telecopy,  confirmed
immediately in writing if by telephone, in the form of a Notice of Continuation,
specifying  (a) the proposed date of such  Continuation,  (b) the LIBOR Loan and
portion  thereof  subject  to such  Continuation  and (c)  the  duration  of the
selected  Interest Period,  all of which shall be specified in such manner as is
necessary to comply with all limitations on Loans  outstanding  hereunder.  Each
Notice of Continuation  shall be irrevocable by and binding on the Borrower once
given.  Promptly after receipt of a Notice of Continuation,  the  Administrative
Agent shall  notify each Lender by telex or telecopy,  or other  similar form of
transmission of the proposed Continuation.  If the Borrower shall fail to select
in a timely manner a new Interest  Period for any LIBOR Loan in accordance  with
this Section, such Loan
                                       43
<PAGE>
will  automatically,  on the last day of the current  Interest Period  therefor,
Convert into a Base Rate Loan notwithstanding  failure of the Borrower to comply
with Section 2.10.

     Conversion.
     -----------

        So long as no Default or Event of Default  exists,  the  Borrower may on
any Business  Day, upon the  Borrower's  giving of a Notice of Conversion to the
Administrative Agent, Convert all or a portion of a Loan of one Type into a Loan
of another Type.  Any  Conversion of a LIBOR Loan into a Base Rate Loan shall be
made on,  and only on,  the last day of an  Interest  Period for such LIBOR Loan
and, upon  Conversion of a Base Rate Loan into a LIBOR Loan,  the Borrower shall
pay  accrued  interest  to the date of  Conversion  on the  principal  amount so
Converted.  Each such  Notice of  Conversion  shall be given not later than 9:00
a.m. on the Business Day prior to the date of any proposed  Conversion into Base
Rate  Loans and on the  third  Business  Day  prior to the date of any  proposed
Conversion  into LIBOR Loans.  Promptly after receipt of a Notice of Conversion,
the Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender by telex or telecopy, or other
similar  form  of  transmission  of  the  proposed  Conversion.  Subject  to the
restrictions  specified  above,  each Notice of Conversion shall be by telephone
(confirmed  immediately  in  writing)  or  telecopy  in the form of a Notice  of
Conversion specifying (a) the requested date of such Conversion, (b) the Type of
Loan to be Converted,  (c) the portion of such Type of Loan to be Converted, (d)
the Type of Loan such Loan is to be Converted into and (e) if such Conversion is
into a LIBOR Loan, the requested  duration of the Interest  Period of such Loan.
Each Notice of Conversion  shall be  irrevocable  by and binding on the Borrower
once given.

     Notes.
     ------

        The  Revolving  Loans made by each  Lender  shall,  in  addition to this
Agreement,  also be evidenced by a promissory note of the Borrower substantially
in the form of Exhibit G-1 (each a  "Revolving  Note"),  payable to the order of
such  Lender in a  principal  amount  equal to the amount of its  Commitment  as
originally in effect and otherwise  duly  completed.  The Bid Rate Loans made by
any  Lender to the  Borrower  shall,  in  addition  to this  Agreement,  also be
evidenced by a Bid Rate Note  payable to the order of such Lender  substantially
in the form of Exhibit G-3. The Swingline Loans made by the Swingline  Lender to
the  Borrower  shall,  in addition to this  Agreement,  also be  evidenced  by a
Swingline Note payable to the order of the Swingline Lender substantially in the
form of Exhibit G-2.

   Expiration or Termination Date of Letters of Credit Past Termination Date.

        If on the date the Commitments are terminated (whether  voluntarily,  by
reason of the  occurrence  of an Event of Default or  otherwise),  there are any
Letters of Credit outstanding  hereunder,  the Borrower shall, on such date, pay
to the  Administrative  Agent an amount of money  equal to the Stated  Amount of
such  Letter(s)  of Credit  for  deposit  into the  Letter of Credit  Collateral
Account.  If a drawing  pursuant to any such Letter of Credit occurs on or prior
to the  expiration  date of such Letter of Credit,  the Borrower  authorizes the
Administrative  Agent  to use the  monies  deposited  in the  Letter  of  Credit
Collateral  Account to make  payment  to the  beneficiary  with  respect to such
drawing or the payee with respect to such  presentment.  If no drawing occurs on
or prior to the expiration date of such Letter of Credit, the Administrative

                                       44
<PAGE>
Agent shall pay to the  Borrower  (or to whomever  else may be legally  entitled
thereto)  the  monies  deposited  in the  Letter  of Credit  Collateral  Account
(together with any accrued  interest  thereon) with respect to such  outstanding
Letter of Credit on or before the date  thirty  (30) days  after the  expiration
date of such Letter of Credit.

     Amount Limitations.

        Notwithstanding  any other  term of this  Agreement  or any  other  Loan
Document,   (a)  no  Lender  shall  be  required  to  make  any  Loan,  and  the
Administrative Agent shall not be required to issue any Letter of Credit or make
any  Swingline  Loan if,  immediately  after the making of such Loan  (including
Swingline  Loans) or issuance of such Letter of Credit the  aggregate  principal
amount of all outstanding Loans (including  Swingline Loans),  together with the
aggregate  amount of all Letter of Credit  Liabilities,  would exceed either (i)
the  Total  Commitment  Amount  or (ii)  the  Maximum  Availability  and (b) the
aggregate  principal  amount of all  outstanding Bid Rate Loans shall not exceed
$150,000,000.

     Optional Increase to the Commitment.

          (a) Provided that no Event of Default or Default then exists, Borrower
may, in accordance  with the provisions of this Section 2.14 and on no more than
three (3) occasions prior to February 12, 2005, request in writing that the then
Total Commitment Amount be increased up to $400,000,000, provided, however, that
no such  request  shall be for an  increase  amount less than  $20,000,000.  Any
request under this Section shall be submitted by Borrower to the Lenders through
Administrative  Agent  not less than  thirty  (30)  days  prior to the  proposed
increase, specify the proposed effective date and amount of such increase and be
accompanied by (i) an Officer's Certificate of Borrower stating that no Event of
Default or Default  exists as of the date of the request or will result from the
requested increase,  (ii) a written consent to the increase in the amount of the
Commitments  executed  by each  Guarantor  and  (iii)  the  satisfaction  of all
conditions precedent specified in Article VI. Borrower may also specify any fees
offered  to those  Lenders  which  agree to an  increase  in the amount of their
respective  Pro Rata Shares of the Total  Commitment  Amount  (which fees may be
variable  based upon the amount which any such Lender is willing to assume as an
increase to the amount of its Pro Rata Share of the increased Commitments).  The
consent of the  Lenders,  as such,  shall not be required for an increase in the
amount of the Total Commitment Amount pursuant to this Section 2.14.

          (b) Each Lender may approve or reject a request for an increase in the
amount  of its Pro Rata  Share of the  Total  Commitment  Amount in its sole and
absolute  discretion and, absent an affirmative  written response within fifteen
(15) days after  receipt of such  request,  shall be deemed to have rejected the
request.  The  rejection  of such a request by any  number of Lenders  shall not
affect Borrower's right to increase the Total Commitment Amount pursuant to this
Section  as a result  of, and with  respect  to the Pro Rata  Shares  of,  those
Lenders that approve such  increase and such  additional  Lenders that join this
Agreement  in   accordance   with   subsection   (e)  of  this   Section   2.14.
Notwithstanding  any other provision  hereof,  no Lender which rejects a request
for an increase in the Total  Commitment  Amount shall be (i) subject to removal
as a Lender,  (ii)  obligated  to lend any amount  greater than its original Pro
Rata Share of the original  Total  Commitment  Amount,  or (iii) deemed to be in
default in any respect hereunder.
                                       45
<PAGE>
          (c) In responding  to a request under this Section,  each Lender which
is willing to increase the amount of its Pro Rata Share of the  increased  Total
Commitment  Amount shall specify the amount of the proposed increase which it is
willing to assume.  Each  consenting  Lender  shall be entitled  to  participate
ratably (based on its Pro Rata Share of the Commitment  before such increase) in
any resulting increase in the Commitment, subject to the right of Administrative
Agent to adjust  allocations of the increased  Commitment so as to result in the
amounts of the Pro Rata Shares of the Lenders  being in  integral  multiples  of
$1,000,000.

          (d) If the  aggregate  principal  amount  offered to be assumed by the
consenting  Lenders  is less than the  amount  requested,  Borrower  in its sole
discretion may (i) reject the proposed increase in its entirety, (ii) accept the
offered amounts or (iii) designate new lenders who qualify as Eligible Assignees
under Section 13.6 and which are reasonably  acceptable to Administrative  Agent
as additional  Lenders  hereunder in accordance  with clause (e) of this Section
(each, a "New Lender"),  which New Lenders may assume the amount of the increase
in the Commitment that has not been assumed by the consenting Lenders.

          (e) Each New Lender  designated by Borrower and reasonably  acceptable
to Administrative  Agent shall become an additional party hereto as a New Lender
concurrently  with the  effectiveness of the proposed increase in the Commitment
upon its  execution of an instrument  of joinder to this  Agreement  which is in
form and substance  acceptable to Administrative  Agent and which, in any event,
contains the  representations,  warranties,  indemnities  and other  protections
afforded to Administrative Agent and the other Lenders which would be granted or
made by an eligible  assignee under Section 13.6 by means of the execution of an
Assignment and Acceptance Agreement.

          (f) Subject to the foregoing, any increase to the Commitment requested
under this Section  shall be  effective as of the date  proposed by Borrower and
shall be in the  principal  amount  equal  to (i) the  amount  which  consenting
Lenders are willing to assume as increases to the amount of their respective Pro
Rata  Shares  plus  (ii)  the  amount  offered  by any  New  Lenders.  Upon  the
effectiveness of any such increase,  Borrower shall execute replacement Notes to
each affected Lender and new Notes to each New Lender, and the Pro Rata Share of
each Lender will be adjusted,  higher or lower as needed,  to give effect to the
increase in the  Commitment  and set forth in a new  Schedule  1.1(A)  issued by
Administrative  Agent.  On or prior to such  effective  date and as  applicable,
certain of the Lenders shall purchase, and certain of the Lenders shall sell, to
one another,  the percentage interest in the Commitment as necessary in order to
reallocate the principal balance under the Notes among the Lenders to correspond
to the Pro Rata  Shares  of the  Lenders  set forth in the new  Schedule  1.1(A)
referred to above,  and Borrower  shall be  obligated to pay any breakage  costs
associated therewith.

     Extension of the Termination Date.

        The Borrower in its sole discretion may request that the  Administrative
Agent  and the  Lenders  extend  the  current  Termination  Date by one  year by
executing and delivering to the  Administrative  Agent at least ninety (90) days
prior to the current Termination Date, a written request for such extension. The
Administrative  Agent shall  forward to each  Lender a copy of any such  request
delivered to the Administrative Agent promptly upon receipt thereof. Subject
                                       46
<PAGE>
to  satisfaction  of the following  conditions,  the  Termination  Date shall be
extended for one year: (a)  immediately  prior to such extension and immediately
after giving effect thereto,  no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred
and be  continuing,  (b) the  Borrower  shall have paid the Fees  payable  under
Section  3.6(b) upon exercise of the extension  option set forth in this Section
2.15, and (c) all representations and warranties made or deemed made by any Loan
Party in any Loan  Document to which any such Loan Party is a party are true and
correct on the effective date of such extension (except for  representations  or
warranties which expressly relate solely to an earlier date).

                   PAYMENTS, FEES AND OTHER GENERAL PROVISIONS

     Payments.

        Except  to  the  extent  otherwise  provided  herein,  all  payments  of
principal,  interest  and other  amounts to be made by the  Borrower  under this
Agreement or any other Loan Document  shall be made in Dollars,  in  immediately
available  funds,   without   deduction,   set-off  or   counterclaim,   to  the
Administrative  Agent,  not later  than  11:00  a.m.  on the date on which  such
payment  shall  become due (each such  payment  made after such time on such due
date to be deemed to have been made on the next  succeeding  Business  Day). The
Borrower  shall,  at the time of making each payment under this Agreement or any
Note,  specify to the  Administrative  Agent the amounts payable by the Borrower
hereunder to which such payment is to be applied.  Each payment  received by the
Administrative  Agent for the account of a Lender  under this  Agreement  or any
Note  of  such  Lender  shall  be paid to  such  Lender,  by  wire  transfer  of
immediately  available funds in accordance with the wiring instructions provided
by such Lender to the Administrative Agent from time to time, for the account of
such  Lender  at  the  applicable   Lending  Office  of  such  Lender.   If  the
Administrative  Agent fails to pay such amount to a Lender  within one  Business
Day of receipt thereof by the  Administrative  Agent, the  Administrative  Agent
shall pay  interest on such  amount  until paid at a rate per annum equal to the
Federal  Funds Rate from time to time in effect.  If the due date of any payment
under this  Agreement or any other Loan Document  would  otherwise fall on a day
which is not a Business  Day such date shall be extended to the next  succeeding
Business Day and interest shall be payable for the period of such extension.

     Pro Rata Treatment.

        Except to the extent otherwise  provided herein: (a) each borrowing from
Lenders  under  Section 2.1 shall be made from the Lenders,  each payment of the
fees under  Sections  3.6(b),  3.6(d) and the first  sentence of 3.6(e) shall be
made for the ratable benefit of the Lenders,  and each  termination or reduction
of the amount of the Commitments  pursuant to this Agreement shall be applied to
the respective  Commitments of the Lenders, pro rata according to the amounts of
their  respective  Commitments;  (b) each payment or  prepayment of principal of
Revolving Loans by the Borrower shall be made for the account of each Lender pro
rata in accordance with the respective unpaid principal amounts of the Revolving
Loans held by them,  provided that if immediately  prior to giving effect to any
such payment in respect of any Revolving Loans the outstanding  principal amount
of the  Revolving  Loans shall not be held by the Lenders pro rata in accordance
with their  respective  Commitments  in effect at the time such Loans were made,
then
                                       47
<PAGE>
such  payment  shall be applied to the  Revolving  Loans in such manner as shall
result, as nearly as is practicable,  in the outstanding principal amount of the
Revolving  Loans  being held by the Lenders  pro rata in  accordance  with their
respective  Commitments;  (c) each payment of interest on Revolving Loans by the
Borrower  shall be made for the account of the  Lenders  pro rata in  accordance
with  the  amounts  of  interest  on such  Loans  then  due and  payable  to the
respective Lenders;  (d) the Conversion and Continuation of Revolving Loans of a
particular  Type (other than  Conversions  provided for by Section 5.5) shall be
made pro rata among the Lenders  according  to the  amounts of their  respective
Commitments (in the case of making of Loans) or their  respective  Loans (in the
case of Conversions  or  Continuations  of Loans) and the then current  Interest
Period for each Lender's  portion of each  Revolving  Loan of such Type shall be
coterminous;  (e) each payment or prepayment of principal and/or interest of Bid
Rate Loans by the Borrower  pursuant to Section 2.8(b) shall be made for account
of each  Lender  then  owed  Bid Rate  Loans  pro  rata in  accordance  with the
respective  unpaid  principal  amounts  of the Bid Rate Loans then owing to each
such  Lender;  (f) the Lenders'  participation  in, and payment  obligations  in
respect of, Swingline Loans under Section 2.3, shall be in accordance with their
respective Pro Rata Shares;  and (g) the Lenders'  participation in, and payment
obligations  in respect of,  Letters of Credit under  Section 2.2,  shall be pro
rata in accordance with their respective Commitments. All payments of principal,
interest,  fees and other amounts in respect of the Swingline Loans shall be for
the account of the Swingline  Lender only (except to the extent any Lender shall
have acquired a  participating  interest in any such  Swingline Loan pursuant to
Section 2.3).

     Sharing of Payments, Setoff, Etc.

        The  Borrower  agrees  that,  in addition to any rights now or hereafter
granted  under  Applicable  Law and not by way of limitation of any such rights,
the Administrative  Agent, each Lender and each Participant is hereby authorized
by the Borrower, at any time or from time to time so long as but only so long as
an Event of Default  exists to set off and to  appropriate  and to apply any and
all deposits (general or special,  including,  but not limited to,  indebtedness
evidenced by  certificates  of deposit,  whether  matured or unmatured)  and any
other indebtedness at any time held or owing by the  Administrative  Agent, such
Lender or any affiliate of the  Administrative  Agent or such Lender,  to or for
the credit or the account of the  Borrower  against and on account of any of the
Obligations,  irrespective  of  whether  or not any or all of the  Loans and all
other  Obligations have been declared to be, or have otherwise  become,  due and
payable as permitted by Section  11.2,  and although such  obligations  shall be
contingent or unmatured.  The  foregoing  rights may be exercised  without prior
notice to the  Borrower or to any other  Person,  any such notice  being  hereby
expressly waived (provided that  Administrative  Agent shall give after-the-fact
notice  to  Borrower),  but in the case of a Lender  or a  Participant  shall be
subject to  receipt of the prior  written  consent of the  Administrative  Agent
exercised  in its sole  discretion.  If a Lender  shall  obtain  payment  of any
principal  of, or  interest  on,  any Loan  made by it to  Borrower  under  this
Agreement or shall obtain payment on any other  Obligation owing by the Borrower
or any other Loan Party  through the exercise of any right of set-off,  banker's
lien or  counterclaim  or  similar  right  or  otherwise  or  through  voluntary
prepayments  directly to a Lender or other  payments made by the Borrower or any
other Loan Party to a Lender not in accordance  with the terms of this Agreement
and such payment  should be  distributed  to the Lenders pro rata in  accordance
with Section 3.2 or Section  11.4,  as  applicable,  such Lender shall  promptly
purchase  from the other  Lenders  participations  in (or,  if and to the extent
specified by
                                       48
<PAGE>
such Lender,  direct  interests in) the Loans made by the other Lenders or other
Obligations owed to such other Lenders in such amounts,  pay such amounts to the
other  Lenders  and make such  other  adjustments  from time to time as shall be
equitable,  to the end that all the  Lenders  shall  share the  benefit  of such
payment (net of any  reasonable  expenses which may actually be incurred by such
Lender in obtaining or preserving  such benefit) pro rata in accordance with the
requirements of Section 3.2 or Section 11.4, as applicable. To such end, all the
Lenders shall make  appropriate  adjustments  among themselves (by the resale of
participations sold or otherwise) if such payment is rescinded or must otherwise
be restored.  The Borrower  agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation
(or  direct  interest)  in the  Loans or other  Obligations  owed to such  other
Lenders may  exercise  all rights of set-off,  banker's  lien,  counterclaim  or
similar rights with the respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender
were a direct  holder  of Loans in the  amount  of such  participation.  Nothing
contained  herein  shall  require any Lender to exercise any such right or shall
affect  the  right  of any  Lender  to  exercise  and  retain  the  benefits  of
exercising,  any such right with respect to any other indebtedness or obligation
of the Borrower.

     Several Obligations.

        No Lender  shall be  responsible  for the failure of any other Lender to
make a Loan or to perform any other  obligation  to be made or performed by such
other  Lender  hereunder,  and the  failure  of any  Lender to make a Loan or to
perform any other  obligation to be made or performed by it hereunder  shall not
relieve the  obligation  of any other  Lender to make any Loan or to perform any
other obligation to be made or performed by such other Lender.

     Minimum Amounts.

        Borrowings.  Each  borrowing of Base Rate Loans shall be in an aggregate
minimum  amount of  $1,000,000  and  integral  multiples  of  $100,000 in excess
thereof. Each borrowing of and Continuation of, and each Conversion of Base Rate
Loans into,  LIBOR Loans shall be in an aggregate  minimum  amount of $1,000,000
and integral multiples of $100,000 in excess of that amount.

        Prepayments. Each voluntary prepayment of Revolving Loans shall be in an
aggregate  minimum  amount of $1,000,000  and integral  multiples of $100,000 in
excess thereof.

     Fees.

        Loan Fee. The Borrower agrees to pay to the  Administrative  Agent on or
prior to the  Effective  Date a loan fee as set forth in the Fee  Letter,  which
loan fee  Administrative  Agent shall share with the other Lenders in accordance
with Administrative Agent's separate agreements with such Lenders.

        Extension Fee. If, pursuant to Section 2.15, the Borrower  exercises its
right  to  extend  the  Termination  Date,  the  Borrower  agrees  to pay to the
Administrative  Agent for the account of each Lender an  extension  fee equal to
two tenths of one  percent  (0.20%) of the amount of each  Lender's  Commitment.
Such fees shall be paid to the Administrative Agent upon, and as a condition to,
Borrower's exercise of such extension.
                                       49
<PAGE>
        Bid Rate Loan Fees.  The  Borrower  agrees to pay to the  Administrative
Agent such fees for services rendered by the Administrative  Agent in connection
with  the Bid  Rate  Loans as are set  forth  in the Fee  Letter  or as shall be
separately agreed upon between the Borrower and the Administrative Agent.

        Facility  Fees.  During  the  period  from  the  Effective  Date  to but
excluding the Termination Date, the Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative
Agent for the ratable  benefit of the Lenders a facility  fee per annum equal to
the  percentage  of the Total  Commitment  Amount  set forth in the table  below
corresponding  to the  applicable  Level at which  the  "Applicable  Margin"  is
determined in accordance with the definition thereof:

----------------   ------------------------------
     Level                Facility Fee
----------------   ------------------------------
       1                      0.15%
----------------   ------------------------------
       2                      0.15%
----------------   ------------------------------
       3                      0.20%
----------------   ------------------------------
       4                      0.20%
---------------- --------------------------------
       5                      0.20%
---------------- --------------------------------
       6                      0.25%
---------------- --------------------------------


Such fees shall be computed and payable quarterly in arrears on the first day of
each January,  April,  July and October during the term of this Agreement and on
the Termination Date.

     Letter of Credit  Fees.  The Borrower  agrees to pay to the  Administrative
Agent for the  ratable  benefit of the Lenders a letter of credit fee in respect
of each outstanding Letter of Credit at a rate per annum equal to the greater of
(i) the Applicable Margin for LIBOR Loans from time to time in effect multiplied
by the Stated  Amount of such  Letter of Credit or (ii)  $1,000.  Such letter of
credit fee shall be payable  quarterly in arrears (for the respective  number of
days  outstanding)  on the first day of each  January,  April,  July and October
during the term of such Letter of Credit,  provided that the full amount of such
fee shall be immediately due and payable upon any early  termination of a Letter
of  Credit.  The  Borrower  shall pay  directly  to the  Administrative  Agent a
fronting  fee for its  account  with  respect to each  Letter of Credit  issued,
together with from time to time on demand all  commissions,  charges,  costs and
expenses in the amounts  customarily  charged by the  Administrative  Agent from
time to time in like  circumstances  with respect to the issuance of each Letter
of Credit, drawings, amendments and other transactions relating thereto.

     Administrative   and  Other   Fees.   The   Borrower   agrees  to  pay  the
administrative,  arrangement and other fees of the  Administrative  Agent as set
forth in the Fee Letter or as may otherwise be agreed to in writing  between the
Borrower and the Administrative Agent from time to time.

     Computations.

     Unless  otherwise  expressly set forth herein,  any accrued interest on any
Loan, any Fees or other Obligations due hereunder shall be computed on the basis
of a year of 360 days and the actual number of days elapsed.

                                       50
<PAGE>

     Usury.

     In no event  shall the  amount of  interest  due or payable on the Loans or
other Obligations  exceed the maximum rate of interest allowed by Applicable Law
and, if any such payment is paid by the Borrower or received by any Lender, then
such excess sum shall be credited as a payment of principal, unless the Borrower
shall notify the respective  Lender in writing that the Borrower  elects to have
such  excess sum  returned  to it  forthwith.  It is the  express  intent of the
parties  hereto that the Borrower not pay and the Lenders not receive,  directly
or indirectly, in any manner whatsoever, interest in excess of that which may be
lawfully paid by the Borrower under Applicable Law.

     Agreement Regarding Interest and Charges.

     The parties  hereto hereby agree and stipulate that the only charge imposed
upon the Borrower for the use of money in connection  with this Agreement is and
shall be the interest specifically  described in Section 2.5(a)(i) through (iv).
Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  the parties hereto further agree and stipulate
that all agency fees,  syndication  fees,  facility fees, letter of credit fees,
default  charges,  funding  or  "breakage"  charges,   increased  cost  charges,
attorneys'  fees  and   reimbursement   for  costs  and  expenses  paid  by  the
Administrative  Agent or any Lender to third parties or for damages  incurred by
the  Administrative  Agent or any Lender,  are charges  made to  compensate  the
Administrative  Agent or any such  Lender  for  underwriting  or  administrative
services  and costs or losses  performed  or  incurred,  and to be  performed or
incurred,  by the  Administrative  Agent and the Lenders in connection with this
Agreement and shall under no  circumstances  be deemed to be charges for the use
of money.  All  charges  other than  charges for the use of money shall be fully
earned and nonrefundable when due.

     Statements of Account.

     The Administrative  Agent shall,  within fifteen (15) days after the end of
each calendar month, account to the Borrower monthly with a written statement of
Loans,  accrued  interest and Fees,  charges and payments  made pursuant to this
Agreement  and the  other  Loan  Documents,  and such  account  rendered  by the
Administrative  Agent shall be deemed  conclusive  upon Borrower absent manifest
error.  The  Administrative  Agent will  account to the  Borrower  on changes in
Letters  of Credit  in  accordance  with  Section  2.2(k).  The  failure  of the
Administrative  Agent to deliver such a statement of accounts  shall not relieve
or discharge the Borrower from any of its obligations hereunder.

     Defaulting Lenders.

     If for any reason any Lender (a  "Defaulting  Lender") shall fail or refuse
to  perform  any of its  obligations  under  this  Agreement  or any other  Loan
Document to which it is a party within the time period specified for performance
of such  obligation  or, if no time  period is  specified,  if such  failure  or
refusal  continues  for a period of two  Business  Days  after  notice  from the
Administrative  Agent,  then, in addition to the rights and remedies that may be
available to the  Administrative  Agent or the Borrower  under this Agreement or
Applicable   Law,  such   Defaulting   Lender's  right  to  participate  in  the
administration  of the  Loans,  this  Agreement  and the other
                                       51
<PAGE>
Loan Documents,  including without limitation,  any right to vote in respect of,
to consent to or to direct any action or inaction of the Administrative Agent or
to be taken into account in the calculation of the Requisite  Lenders,  shall be
suspended  during the  pendency  of such  failure or  refusal.  If a Lender is a
Defaulting  Lender  because  it  has  failed  to  make  timely  payment  to  the
Administrative  Agent of any amount  required  to be paid to the  Administrative
Agent  hereunder  (without  giving  effect to any  notice or cure  periods),  in
addition to other  rights and  remedies  which the  Administrative  Agent or the
Borrower may have under the immediately  preceding provisions or otherwise,  the
Administrative  Agent  shall be  entitled  (i) to  collect  interest  from  such
Defaulting  Lender on such  delinquent  payment  for the period from the date on
which the  payment  was due until the date on which the  payment  is made at the
Federal Funds Rate,  (ii) to withhold or setoff and to apply in  satisfaction of
the defaulted payment and any related interest, any amounts otherwise payable to
such Defaulting Lender under this Agreement or any other Loan Document and (iii)
to  bring  an  action  or suit  against  such  Defaulting  Lender  in a court of
competent jurisdiction to recover the defaulted amount and any related interest.
Any amounts  received  by the  Administrative  Agent in respect of a  Defaulting
Lender's  Loans  shall not be paid to such  Defaulting  Lender and shall be held
uninvested by the  Administrative  Agent and paid to such Defaulting Lender upon
the Defaulting Lender's curing of its default.

     Taxes.

     Taxes Generally. All payments by the Borrower of principal of, and interest
on,  the  Loans and all  other  Obligations  shall be made free and clear of and
without deduction for any present or future excise,  stamp or other taxes, fees,
duties, levies, imposts, charges,  deductions,  withholdings or other charges of
any nature  whatsoever  imposed  by any  taxing  authority,  but  excluding  (i)
franchise taxes, (ii) any taxes (other than withholding taxes) that would not be
imposed but for a connection between the Administrative Agent or a Lender (which
for purposes of the  exclusions  in clauses  (i)-(iv) of this  Section  3.12(a),
includes any Participant) and the jurisdiction imposing such taxes (other than a
connection  arising  solely by virtue of the  activities  of the  Administrative
Agent or such Lender  pursuant to or in respect of this  Agreement  or any other
Loan Document),  (iii) any taxes imposed on or measured by any Lender's  assets,
net income,  receipts or branch  profits  and (iv) any taxes  arising  after the
Agreement Date solely as a result of or  attributable  to a Lender  changing its
designated  Lending  Office after the date such Lender becomes a party hereto or
transferring  any  interest in any Loan to the extent such Lender would not have
been liable for such taxes (such non-excluded  items being  collectively  called
"Taxes").  If any  withholding  or deduction  from any payment to be made by the
Borrower  hereunder  is  required  in  respect  of  any  Taxes  pursuant  to any
Applicable Law, then the Borrower will:

     pay  directly  to the  relevant  Governmental  Authority  the  full  amount
required to be so withheld or deducted;

     promptly forward to the  Administrative  Agent an official receipt or other
documentation  satisfactory to the Administrative  Agent evidencing such payment
to such Governmental Authority; and

                                       52
<PAGE>
     pay to the  Administrative  Agent for its  account  or the  account  of the
applicable  Lender,  as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as is
necessary to ensure that the net amount actually received by the  Administrative
Agent or such Lender will equal the full amount that the Administrative Agent or
such Lender  would have  received  had no such  withholding  or  deduction  been
required.

     Tax Indemnification. If the Borrower fails to pay any Taxes when due to the
appropriate  Governmental  Authority  or fails  to  remit to the  Administrative
Agent, for its account or the account of the respective  Lender, as the case may
be, the required receipts or other required documentary  evidence,  the Borrower
shall  indemnify the  Administrative  Agent and the Lenders for any  incremental
Taxes, interest or penalties that may become payable by the Administrative Agent
or any Lender as a result of any such failure.  For purposes of this Section,  a
distribution  hereunder by the Administrative  Agent or any Lender to or for the
account of any Lender shall be deemed a payment by the Borrower.

     Tax Forms. Prior to the date that any Lender or Participant organized under
the laws of a jurisdiction  outside the United States of America becomes a party
hereto,  such Person shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative  Agent
such  certificates,  documents  or other  evidence,  as required by the Internal
Revenue Code or Treasury Regulations issued pursuant thereto (including Internal
Revenue Service Forms W-8ECI and W-8BEN, as applicable, or appropriate successor
forms), properly completed, currently effective and duly executed by such Lender
or  Participant  establishing  that payments to it hereunder and under the Notes
are (i) not subject to United States Federal backup withholding tax and (ii) not
subject  to United  States  Federal  withholding  tax under the Code.  Each such
Lender or  Participant  shall (x) deliver  further copies of such forms or other
appropriate  certifications  on or before the date that any such forms expire or
become  obsolete or after the occurrence of any event  requiring a change in the
most recent form delivered to the Borrower and (y) obtain such extensions of the
time for  filing,  and renew  such  forms and  certifications  thereof as may be
reasonably  requested by the Borrower or the Administrative  Agent. The Borrower
shall not be required to pay any amount  pursuant to last sentence of subsection
(a) above to any Lender or  Participant  that is  organized  under the laws of a
jurisdiction  outside  of the United  States of  America  or the  Administrative
Agent, if it is organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside of the United
States of America, if such Lender,  Participant or the Administrative  Agent, as
applicable,  fails to comply with the  requirements of this  subsection.  If any
such  Lender  or  Participant   fails  to  deliver  the  above  forms  or  other
documentation,  then the Administrative  Agent may withhold from such payment to
such Lender such amounts as are required by the Internal  Revenue  Code.  If any
Governmental  Authority asserts that the  Administrative  Agent did not properly
withhold or backup  withhold,  as the case may be, any tax or other  amount from
payments made to or for the account of any Lender,  such Lender shall  indemnify
the  Administrative  Agent therefor,  including all penalties and interest,  any
taxes imposed by any  jurisdiction on the amounts payable to the  Administrative
Agent  under  this  Section,  and costs  and  expenses  (including  all fees and
disbursements  of any law firm or other external  counsel and the allocated cost
of internal legal  services and all  disbursements  of internal  counsel) of the
Administrative  Agent. The obligation of the Lenders and Participants under this
Section  shall  survive the  termination  of the  Commitments,  repayment of all
Obligations and the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent.

                          UNENCUMBERED POOL PROPERTIES

     Inclusion of Unencumbered Pool Properties.

     Existing Unencumbered Pool Properties. Subject to compliance with the terms
and  conditions of Section  6.1(a),  as of the Effective Date the parties hereto
acknowledge   and  agree  that  the  Properties   listed  on  Schedule  4.1  are
Unencumbered Pool Properties.

     Additional  Unencumbered  Pool  Properties.  After the  Effective  Date, if
Borrower  intends  to  designate  an  Eligible  Property  to be  included  as an
Unencumbered Pool Property from time to time, it will notify the  Administrative
Agent of such  intention,  which  notice  will  include,  with  respect  to such
Eligible  Property,  (i) an  Unencumbered  Pool  Certificate  setting  forth the
information  required to be contained  therein and assuming  that such  Eligible
Property  is  included  as  an  Unencumbered  Pool  Property,  (ii)  such  other
information   as  the   Administrative   Agent  or  any  Lender   (through   the
Administrative  Agent) may reasonably  request in connection with the evaluation
of  such  Eligible  Property.  Subject  to the  terms  and  conditions  of  this
Agreement,  upon the Administrative Agent's receipt of such certificate and such
other  information,  such Eligible Property shall be included as an Unencumbered
Pool  Property.  Any  Property  that does not  satisfy  the  requirements  of an
Eligible  Property shall be included as an Unencumbered  Pool Property only upon
the written approval of the Requisite  Lenders.  If a Property that is to become
an Unencumbered Pool Property is owned (or is being acquired) by a Subsidiary of
the Borrower  that is not yet a party to the Guaranty,  such Property  shall not
become an  Unencumbered  Pool Property  unless and until an Accession  Agreement
executed by such Subsidiary,  and all other items required to be delivered under
Section 8.14, have all been delivered to the Administrative Agent.

     Termination of Designation as Unencumbered Pool Property.

     If Borrower at any time  intends to withdraw  any  Eligible  Property  from
inclusion  as  an   Unencumbered   Pool  Property,   it  shall  (a)  notify  the
Administrative  Agent of its  intention,  and (b) deliver to the  Administrative
Agent  an  Unencumbered   Pool   Certificate   setting  forth  the  calculations
establishing  that Borrower will be in compliance  with Section 2.13 with giving
effect to such withdrawal (and any concurrent addition of Eligible Properties as
Unencumbered Pool Properties),  which  calculations shall be in such detail, and
otherwise  in such  form  and  substance,  as  Administrative  Agent  reasonably
requires. Effective automatically upon receipt of such notice and certificate by
Administrative  Agent  (or upon any later  date  stated  in such  notice),  such
Eligible  Property  shall no longer  constitute an  Unencumbered  Pool Property.
Additionally,  any Property previously included as an Unencumbered Pool Property
but which is not  included  in an  Unencumbered  Pool  Certificate  subsequently
submitted  pursuant  to  this  Agreement  shall  no  longer  be  included  as an
Unencumbered  Pool  Property  (effective  as of  the  date  of  receipt  by  the
Administrative  Agent of such Unencumbered Pool Certificate and until such time,
if ever,  as  Borrower  re-designates  such  Property  as an  Unencumbered  Pool
Property in  accordance  with Section  4.1(b)) so long as no Default or Event of
Default  exists or would  exist  immediately  after such  Property  is no longer
included as an Unencumbered Pool Property.
                                       54
<PAGE>
                  Ineligibility of a Property as Unencumbered Pool Property.

     If a Property at any time ceases to be an Eligible Property,  such Property
shall  automatically  no longer  constitute an Unencumbered  Pool Property,  and
Borrower shall immediately (a) notify the Administrative  Agent, and (b) deliver
to the Administrative  Agent an Unencumbered Pool Certificate  setting forth the
calculations  establishing that Borrower will be in compliance with Section 2.13
with giving effect to the termination of such Property as an  Unencumbered  Pool
Property, which calculations shall be in such detail, and otherwise in such form
and substance, as Administrative Agent reasonably requires.

                             YIELD PROTECTION, ETC.

     Additional Costs; Capital Adequacy.

     Additional  Costs.  The Borrower shall  promptly pay to the  Administrative
Agent for the account of a Lender from time to time such  amounts as such Lender
may reasonably determine to be necessary to compensate such Lender for any costs
incurred by such Lender that it reasonably  determines are  attributable  to its
making or  maintaining  of any LIBOR Loans or its  obligation  to make any LIBOR
Loans  hereunder,  any  reduction in any amount  receivable by such Lender under
this  Agreement  or any of the other  Loan  Documents  in respect of any of such
Loans or such obligation or the maintenance by such Lender of capital in respect
of its  Loans or its  Commitment  (such  increases  in costs and  reductions  in
amounts receivable being herein called "Additional  Costs"),  resulting from any
Regulatory Change that: (i) changes the basis of taxation of any amounts payable
to such  Lender  under  this  Agreement  or any of the other Loan  Documents  in
respect of any of such Loans or its  Commitment  (other than taxes imposed on or
measured by the  overall net income of such Lender or of its Lending  Office for
any of such Loans by the  jurisdiction  in which such  Lender has its  principal
office or such Lending Office); or (ii) imposes or modifies any reserve, special
deposit or similar requirements  (including without limitation,  Regulation D of
the Board of Governors of the Federal  Reserve  System or other similar  reserve
requirement  applicable  to any other  category  of  liabilities  or category of
extensions  of credit or other assets by reference to which the interest rate on
LIBOR Loans is determined)  relating to any extensions of credit or other assets
of, or any deposits with or other  liabilities  of, or other credit extended by,
or any other acquisition of funds by such Lender (or its parent corporation), or
any commitment of such Lender (including,  without limitation, the Commitment of
such Lender  hereunder);  or (iii) has or would have the effect of reducing  the
rate of return on capital of such Lender to a level below that which such Lender
could have achieved but for such  Regulatory  Change (taking into  consideration
such Lender's policies with respect to capital adequacy).

     Lender's  Suspension  of LIBOR  Loans.  Without  limiting the effect of the
provisions  of the  immediately  preceding  subsection  (a), if by reason of any
Regulatory  Change,  any Lender either (i) incurs  Additional  Costs based on or
measured by the excess  above a  specified  level of the amount of a category of
deposits or other liabilities of such Lender that includes deposits by reference
to which the  interest  rate on LIBOR  Loans is  determined  as provided in this
Agreement or a category of  extensions  of credit or other assets of such Lender
that includes LIBOR Loans or (ii) becomes  subject to restrictions on the amount
of such a category  of
                                       55
<PAGE>
liabilities or assets that it may hold, then, if such Lender so elects by notice
to the Borrower  (with a copy to the  Administrative  Agent),  the obligation of
such  Lender to make or  Continue,  or to Convert  any other Type of Loans into,
LIBOR Loans hereunder shall be suspended until such Regulatory  Change ceases to
be in effect (in which case the provisions of Section 5.5 shall apply).

     Additional  Costs in Respect of Letters  of Credit.  Without  limiting  the
obligations of the Borrower under the preceding subsections of this Section (but
without duplication),  if as a result of any Regulatory Change or any risk-based
capital  guideline or other  requirement  heretofore or hereafter  issued by any
Governmental Authority there shall be imposed, modified or deemed applicable any
tax, reserve,  special deposit,  capital adequacy or similar requirement against
or with  respect to or measured by reference to Letters of Credit and the result
shall be to  increase  the cost to the  Administrative  Agent of issuing (or any
Lender of purchasing  participations in) or maintaining its obligation hereunder
to issue (or  purchase  participations  in) any  Letter of Credit or reduce  any
amount receivable by the Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder in respect
of any Letter of Credit,  then, upon demand by the Administrative  Agent or such
Lender, the Borrower shall pay immediately to the  Administrative  Agent for its
account  or the  account of such  Lender,  as  applicable,  from time to time as
specified by the  Administrative  Agent or a Lender,  such additional amounts as
shall be sufficient to compensate  the  Administrative  Agent or such Lender for
such increased costs or reductions in amount.

     Notification   and   Determination  of  Additional   Costs.   Each  of  the
Administrative  Agent and each Lender, as the case may be, shall promptly notify
the Borrower of any event  occurring  after the  Agreement  Date  entitling  the
Administrative  Agent or such Lender to compensation  under any of the preceding
subsections of this Section as promptly as practicable;  provided,  however, the
failure of the Administrative  Agent or any Lender to give such notice shall not
release the Borrower from any of its obligations  hereunder.  The Administrative
Agent or such  Lender  agrees to furnish to the  Borrower  (and in the case of a
Lender to the  Administrative  Agent,  as well) a certificate  setting forth the
basis and amount of each request by the Administrative  Agent or such Lender for
compensation under this Section.  Determinations by the Administrative  Agent or
any Lender of the effect of any Regulatory Change shall be conclusive,  provided
that such determinations are made on a reasonable basis and in good faith.

     Suspension of LIBOR Loans.

     Anything  herein to the  contrary  notwithstanding,  if, on or prior to the
determination of LIBOR for any Interest Period:

     the Administrative  Agent reasonably  determines (which determination shall
be conclusive,  absent manifest error) that quotations of interest rates for the
relevant  deposits referred to in the definition of LIBOR are not being provided
in  the  relevant  amounts  or for  the  relevant  maturities  for  purposes  of
determining rates of interest for LIBOR Loans as provided herein or is otherwise
unable to determine LIBOR, or

     the Administrative  Agent reasonably  determines (which determination shall
be  conclusive,  absent  manifest  error)  that the  relevant  rates of interest
referred  to in the  definition  of LIBOR
                                       56
<PAGE>
upon the basis of which the rate of interest  for LIBOR Loans for such  Interest
Period is to be determined  are not likely to  adequately  cover the cost to any
Lender of making or maintaining LIBOR Loans for such Interest Period; or

     any Lender that has  outstanding  a Bid Rate Quote with  respect to a LIBOR
Margin Loan  reasonably  determines  (which  determination  shall be conclusive,
absent  manifest  error) that LIBOR will not  adequately  and fairly reflect the
cost to such Lender of making or maintaining such LIBOR Margin Loan,

then the  Administrative  Agent shall give the Borrower  and each Lender  prompt
notice thereof and, so long as such condition remains in effect, (i) the Lenders
shall be under no  obligation  to, and shall not, make  additional  LIBOR Loans,
Continue  LIBOR Loans or Convert Loans into LIBOR Loans and the Borrower  shall,
on the last day of each current Interest Period for each outstanding LIBOR Loan,
either  repay such Loan or  Convert  such Loan into a Base Rate Loan and (ii) in
the case of clause (c) above,  no Lender that has  outstanding  a Bid Rate Quote
with respect to a LIBOR Margin Loan shall be under any  obligation  to make such
Loan.

     Illegality.

     Notwithstanding  any  other  provision  of this  Agreement,  if it  becomes
unlawful for any Lender to honor its  obligation to make or maintain LIBOR Loans
hereunder,  then such Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower  thereof (with a
copy to the  Administrative  Agent)  and  such  Lender's  obligation  to make or
Continue,  or to  Convert  Loans of any other Type into,  LIBOR  Loans  shall be
suspended until such time as such Lender may again make and maintain LIBOR Loans
(in which case the provisions of Section 5.5 shall be applicable).

     Compensation.

     The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative  Agent for the account of each
Lender,  upon the request of such Lender through the Administrative  Agent, such
amount or  amounts as shall be  sufficient  (in the  reasonable  opinion of such
Lender)  to  compensate  it for any  loss,  cost or  expense  that  such  Lender
reasonably determines is attributable to:

     any payment or prepayment  (whether mandatory or optional) of a LIBOR Loan,
or  Conversion  of a LIBOR  Loan or Bid Rate Loan,  made by such  Lender for any
reason (including,  without  limitation,  acceleration) on a date other than the
last day of the Interest Period for such Loan; or

     any failure by the Borrower for any reason (including,  without limitation,
the failure of any of the applicable  conditions  precedent specified in Article
VI to be  satisfied) to borrow a LIBOR Loan or Bid Rate Loan from such Lender on
the date for such borrowing, or to Convert a Base Rate Loan into a LIBOR Loan or
Continue a LIBOR Loan on the requested date of such Conversion or Continuation.

Not in limitation of the foregoing,  such  compensation  shall include,  without
limitation; (i) in the case of a LIBOR Loan, an amount equal to the then present
value of (A) the amount of interest  that would have  accrued on such LIBOR Loan
for the  remainder of the Interest  Period at the rate

                                       57
<PAGE>
applicable to such LIBOR Loan, less (B) the amount of interest that would accrue
on the same  LIBOR  Loan for the same  period  if LIBOR  were set on the date on
which such LIBOR Loan was repaid,  prepaid or Converted or the date on which the
Borrower  failed to borrow,  Convert or Continue such LIBOR Loan, as applicable,
calculating  present value by using as a discount rate LIBOR quoted on such date
and (ii) in the case of a Bid Rate Loan,  the sum of such losses and expenses as
the Lender or Designated Lender who made such Bid Rate Loan may reasonably incur
by  reason  of such  prepayment,  including  without  limitation  any  losses or
expenses  incurred in obtaining,  liquidating  or employing  deposits from third
parties.  Upon Borrower's request (made through the  Administrative  Agent), any
Lender seeking compensation under this Section shall provide the Borrower with a
statement  setting  forth the basis for  requesting  such  compensation  and the
method  for  determining  the  amount  thereof.  Any  such  statement  shall  be
conclusive absent manifest error.

     Treatment of Affected Loans.

     If the  obligation of any Lender to make LIBOR Loans or to Continue,  or to
Convert Base Rate Loans into, LIBOR Loans shall be suspended pursuant to Section
5.1(b),  5.2 or 5.3,  then such  Lender's  LIBOR  Loans  shall be  automatically
Converted  into Base Rate Loans on the last day(s) of the then current  Interest
Period(s)  for LIBOR Loans (or, in the case of a Conversion  required by Section
5.1(b) or 5.3, on such  earlier  date as such Lender may specify to the Borrower
with a copy to the Administrative Agent) and, unless and until such Lender gives
notice as provided below that the circumstances specified in Section 5.1, 5.2 or
5.3 that gave rise to such Conversion no longer exist:

     to the extent that such Lender's  LIBOR Loans have been so  Converted,  all
payments and  prepayments of principal  that would  otherwise be applied to such
Lender's LIBOR Loans shall be applied instead to its Base Rate Loans; and

     all Loans that would otherwise be made or Continued by such Lender as LIBOR
Loans shall be made or Continued  instead as Base Rate Loans,  and all Base Rate
Loans of such Lender that would  otherwise be  Converted  into LIBOR Loans shall
remain as Base Rate Loans.

If such Lender gives notice to the Borrower  (with a copy to the  Administrative
Agent) that the circumstances  specified in Section 5.1 or 5.3 that gave rise to
the  Conversion of such Lender's  LIBOR Loans pursuant to this Section no longer
exist (which such Lender agrees to do promptly upon such  circumstances  ceasing
to exist) at a time when LIBOR Loans made by other Lenders are outstanding, then
such Lender's  Base Rate Loans shall be  automatically  Converted,  on the first
day(s) of the next  succeeding  Interest  Period(s) for such  outstanding  LIBOR
Loans, to the extent necessary so that,  after giving effect thereto,  all Loans
held by the Lenders holding LIBOR Loans and by such Lender are held pro rata (as
to principal  amounts,  Types and  Interest  Periods) in  accordance  with their
respective Commitments.

     Change of Lending Office.

     Each  Lender  agrees  that  it will  use  commercially  reasonable  efforts
(consistent  with its internal policy and legal and regulatory  restrictions) to
designate an alternate  Lending Office

                                       58
<PAGE>
with  respect  to any of its Loans  affected  by the  matters  or  circumstances
described in Sections  3.12,  5.1 or 5.3 to reduce the liability of the Borrower
or avoid the results  provided  thereunder,  so long as such  designation is not
disadvantageous  to such  Lender  as  determined  by  such  Lender  in its  sole
discretion,  except that such Lender  shall have no  obligation  to  designate a
Lending Office located in the United States of America.

     Assumptions Concerning Funding of LIBOR Loans.

     Calculation  of all amounts  payable to a Lender under this Article V shall
be made as though  such  Lender had  actually  funded  LIBOR  Loans  through the
purchase  of  deposits  in the  relevant  market  bearing  interest  at the rate
applicable  to such  LIBOR  Loans in an amount  equal to the amount of the LIBOR
Loans  and  having  a  maturity  comparable  to the  relevant  Interest  Period;
provided,  however,  that each  Lender  may fund each of its LIBOR  Loans in any
manner  it  sees  fit and the  foregoing  assumption  shall  be  used  only  for
calculation of amounts payable under this Article V.

                              CONDITIONS PRECEDENT

     Initial Conditions Precedent.

Lender through the Administrative Agent, may reasonably request.

     In the good faith judgment of the Administrative Agent:

     There shall not have occurred or become known to the  Administrative  Agent
or any of the Lenders any event,  condition,  situation or status since the date
of the information contained in the financial and business projections, budgets,
pro forma  data and  forecasts  concerning  the  Borrower  and its  Subsidiaries

Date that has had or could  reasonably  be  expected  to  result  in a  Material
Adverse Effect;

     No   litigation,   action,   suit,   investigation   or   other   arbitral,
administrative or judicial proceeding shall be pending or threatened which could
reasonably  be  expected  to (A)  result  in a  Material  Adverse  Effect or (B)
restrain or enjoin,  impose  materially  burdensome  conditions on, or otherwise
materially  and  adversely  affect the  ability of any Loan Party to fulfill its
obligations under the Loan Documents to which it is a party; and

     The Borrower and the other Loan Parties shall have received all  approvals,
consents and waivers,  and shall have made or will make  contemporaneously  with

be required to  consummate  the  transactions  contemplated  hereby  without the
occurrence  of any  default  under,  conflict  with  or  violation  of  (A)  any
Applicable  Law or (B) any  agreement,  document or instrument to which any Loan
Party is a party  or by which  any of them or  their  respective  properties  is
bound,  except for such approvals,  consents,  waivers,  filings and notices the
receipt,  making or giving of which,  or the  failure  to make,  give or receive
which,  would not reasonably be likely to (1) have a Material Adverse Effect, or
(2) restrain or enjoin, impose materially burdensome conditions on, or otherwise
materially  and  adversely  affect the ability of the Borrower or any other Loan
Party to  fulfill  its  obligations  under the Loan  Documents  to which it is a
party.

            Conditions Precedent to All Loans and Letters of Credit.

     The   obligations  of  (i)  Lenders  to  make  any  Loans,   and  (ii)  the
Administrative  Agent to issue Letters of Credit or make any Swingline Loan, are
each subject to the further condition precedent that: (a) no Default or Event of
Default  shall  exist  as of the  date of the  making  of  such  Loan or date of
issuance of such Letter of Credit or would exist immediately after giving effect
thereto;  (b) the  representations  and  warranties  made or deemed  made by the
Borrower and each other Loan Party in the Loan Documents to which any of them is
a party,  shall be true and  correct in all  material  respects on and as of the
date of the  making of such Loan or date of  issuance  of such  Letter of Credit
with the same force and  effect as if made on and as of such date  except to the
extent that such  representations  and warranties  expressly relate solely to an
earlier date (in which case such  representations and warranties shall have been
true and  accurate  on and as of such  earlier  date) and except for  changes in
factual circumstances  specifically and expressly permitted hereunder and (c) in
the case of the borrowing of Revolving  Loans,  the  Administrative  Agent shall
have received a timely Notice of Borrowing. Each Credit Event shall constitute a
certification by the Borrower to the effect set forth in the preceding  sentence
(both as of the date

                                       61
<PAGE>
of the giving of notice  relating to such Credit Event and,  unless the Borrower
otherwise  notifies  the  Administrative  Agent prior to the date of such Credit
Event, as of the date of the occurrence of such Credit Event). In addition,  the
Borrower shall be deemed to have represented to the Administrative Agent and the
Lenders  at the time such Loan is made or such  Letter of Credit is issued  that
all  conditions  to the making of such Loan or issuing of such  Letter of Credit
contained in this Article VI have been satisfied.

     Conditions as Covenants.

     If the Lenders permit the making of any Loans, or the Administrative  Agent
issues a Letter of Credit, prior to the satisfaction of all conditions precedent
set forth in Sections 6.1 and 6.2, the Borrower  shall  nevertheless  cause such
condition or conditions to be satisfied  within five (5) Business Days after the
date of the  making of such  Loans or the  issuance  of such  Letter of  Credit.
Unless set forth in writing to the contrary, the making of its initial Loan by a
Lender shall  constitute  a  confirmation  by such Lender to the  Administrative
Agent and the other  Lenders  that  insofar  as such  Lender  is  concerned  the
Borrower has satisfied the  conditions  precedent for initial Loans set forth in
Sections 6.1 and 6.2.

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

     Representations and Warranties.

     In order to induce the  Administrative  Agent and each Lender to enter into
this Agreement and to make Loans and, in the case of the  Administrative  Agent,
to issue  Letters of Credit and make  Swingline  Loans,  and, in the case of the
Lenders, to acquire participations in Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans, the
Borrower represents and warrants to the Administrative  Agent and each Lender as
follows:

     Organization;   Power;  Qualification.  Each  of  the  Loan  Parties  is  a
corporation, partnership or other legal entity, duly organized, validly existing
and  in  good  standing  under  the   jurisdiction  of  its   incorporation   or
organization,  has the  corporate or similar power and authority to own or lease
its respective  properties and to carry on its respective  business as now being
and  hereafter  proposed to be conducted  and is duly  qualified  and is in good
standing  as a foreign  corporation,  partnership  or other  legal  entity,  and
authorized to do business,  in each  jurisdiction  in which the character of its
properties  or the  nature  of  its  business  requires  such  qualification  or
authorization  and where the  failure to be so  qualified  or  authorized  could
reasonably be expected to have, in each instance, a Material Adverse Effect.

     Ownership  Structure.  Part I of  Schedule  7.1(b) is, as of the  Effective
Date, a complete and correct list of all  Subsidiaries  of the Borrower  setting
forth for each such  Subsidiary,  (i) the  jurisdiction  of organization of such
Person,  (ii) each Person holding any Equity Interest in such Person,  (iii) the
nature of the Equity  Interests held by each such Person and (iv) the percentage
of ownership of such Person represented by such Equity Interests  (provided that
non-material errors in such schedule shall not constitute a Default hereunder so
long as all parties which are required to become  Guarantors  hereunder  have in
fact  become  Guarantors  hereunder,  notwithstanding  such  errors).  Except as
disclosed in such Schedule,  as of the Effective Date (A) either the
                                       62
<PAGE>
Borrower  or one of the other  Loan  Parties  owns,  free and clear of all Liens
(other  than  Permitted  Liens),  and has the  unencumbered  right to vote,  all
outstanding  Equity  Interests in each Subsidiary shown to be held by it on such
Schedule,  (B) all of the  issued  and  outstanding  capital  stock of each such
Subsidiary  organized  as a  corporation  is  validly  issued,  fully  paid  and
nonassessable and (C) there are no outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants,
commitments,  preemptive  rights or agreements of any kind  (including,  without
limitation,  any  stockholders'  or voting trust  agreements)  for the issuance,
sale, registration or voting of, or outstanding securities convertible into, any
additional  shares  of  capital  stock of any  class,  or  partnership  or other
ownership  interests  of any type in, any such  Subsidiary.  Part II of Schedule
7.1(b)  correctly  sets forth,  as of the  Effective  Date,  all  Unconsolidated
Affiliates  of  the   Borrower,   including  the  correct  legal  name  of  such
Unconsolidated   Affiliates,   the  type  of  legal   entity   which  each  such
Unconsolidated  Affiliate is, and all ownership interests in such Unconsolidated
Affiliates held directly or indirectly by the Borrower.

     Authorization of Agreement, Notes, Loan Documents and Borrowings. Each Loan
Party has the corporate or similar right and power,  and has taken all necessary
action  to  authorize  it, to  borrow  and  obtain  other  extensions  of credit
hereunder (in the case of the Borrower) and to execute, deliver and perform each
of the Loan Documents to which it is a party in accordance with their respective
terms and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, as the
case may be. This  Agreement,  the Notes and each of the other Loan Documents to
which the  Borrower  or any other Loan Party is a party have been duly  executed
and  delivered  by the duly  authorized  officers  of such  Person and each is a
legal,  valid and binding  obligation  of such Person  enforceable  against such
Person  in  accordance  with its  respective  terms,  except  as the same may be
limited  by  bankruptcy,  insolvency,  and other  laws  affecting  the rights of
creditors   generally  and  the  availability  of  equitable  remedies  for  the
enforcement of certain obligations contained herein or therein may be limited by
equitable principles generally.

     Compliance  of  Agreement,  Etc.  with Laws.  The  execution,  delivery and
performance of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which the Borrower
or any other Loan Party is a party in accordance with their respective terms and
the borrowings and other  extensions of credit hereunder do not and will not, by
the passage of time, the giving of notice, or both: (i) require any Governmental
Approval  or violate any  Applicable  Law  (including  all  Environmental  Laws)
relating to the Borrower or any other Loan Party;  (ii)  conflict with or result
in a breach of the  articles of  incorporation  or the bylaws of the Borrower or
the organizational documents of any other Loan Party, or conflict with or result
in a breach of any term or condition  that would  constitute a default under any
Material  Contract;  or (iii) result in or require the creation or imposition of
any Lien  (other  than a Permitted  Lien) upon or with  respect to any  Eligible
Property now owned or hereafter acquired by the Borrower or any other Loan Party
other than in favor of the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Lenders.

     Compliance with Law; Governmental Approvals.  The Borrower, each other Loan
Party and each other Subsidiary is in compliance with each Governmental Approval
and all other Applicable Laws relating to it except for  non-compliances  which,
and Governmental Approvals the failure to possess which, could not, individually
or in the  aggregate,  reasonably  be  expected  to cause a Default  or Event of
Default or have a Material Adverse Effect.

                                       63
<PAGE>

     Title to  Properties.  Schedule  7.1(f)  is, as of the  Effective  Date,  a
complete and correct  listing of all Properties of the Borrower,  the other Loan
Parties and the other Subsidiaries,  setting forth, for each such Property,  the
current  leasing  status  of  such  Property  and  whether  such  Property  is a
Development  Property  or  Redevelopment  Property  and,  if such  Property is a
Development Property or Redevelopment Property, the status of completion of such
Property.  Each of the  Borrower  and  the  other  Loan  Parties  and all  other
Subsidiaries  has  good,  marketable  and legal  title to, or a valid  leasehold
interest in, its respective Properties.

     Existing  Indebtedness.  Schedule  7.1(g) is, as of the  Effective  Date, a
complete and correct listing of all Indebtedness of each of the Loan Parties and
the other Subsidiaries which is secured by any Lien, together with a description
of all of the property  subject to such Lien, and all Guarantees of Indebtedness
provided  by each of the Loan  Parties  and the  other  Subsidiaries.  As of the
Agreement Date, each of the Loan Parties has performed and is in compliance with
all of the material terms of its respective Indebtedness and all instruments and
agreements  relating  thereto,  and no default or event of default,  or event or
condition  which with the giving of notice,  the lapse of time,  or both,  would
constitute  a default  or event of  default,  exists  with  respect  to any such
Indebtedness.

     Material Contracts;  Approved Ground Leases.  Schedule 7.1(h) is, as of the
Effective Date, a true,  correct and complete listing of all Material  Contracts
(other than those  Material  Contracts  which are loan documents with respect to
Secured  Indebtedness).  Each of the  Borrower,  the other Loan  Parties and the
other  Subsidiaries  that are parties to any Material Contract has performed and

other  Subsidiaries  has  violated  any  material  provision  of its articles of
incorporation,  bylaws,  partnership  agreement or other similar  organizational
documents,  and no event has  occurred,  which has not been  remedied,  cured or
waived:  (i) which  constitutes a Default or an Event of Default;  or (ii) which

would constitute,  a default or event of default by the Borrower, any other Loan
Party or any other Subsidiary under any agreement (other than this Agreement) or
judgment,  decree or order to which  any such  Person is a party or by which any
such Person or any of its respective  properties may be bound
                                       65

     Environmental  Laws.  In the  ordinary  course of business and from time to
time each of the Loan Parties and the other Subsidiaries conducts reviews of the
effect  of  Environmental  Laws  on  its  respective  business,  operations  and
properties,  including without  limitation,  its respective  Properties,  in the
course  of  which  such  Loan  Party or such  other  Subsidiary  identifies  and
evaluates  associated  liabilities  and costs  (including,  without  limitation,
determining  whether any capital or  operating  expenditures  are  required  for
clean-up or closure of  properties  presently or previously  owned,  determining
whether  any  capital  or  operating  expenditures  are  required  to achieve or
maintain compliance in all material respects with Environmental Laws or required

constraints  on  operating   activities,   determining   whether  any  costs  or
liabilities  exist in connection  with off-site  disposal of wastes or Hazardous
Materials,  and determining whether any actual or potential liabilities to third
parties, including employees, and any related costs and expenses exist). Each of
the Loan Parties and the other Subsidiaries is in compliance with all applicable
Environmental  Laws  and has  obtained  all  Governmental  Approvals  which  are
required  under  Environmental  Laws and is in  compliance  with all  terms  and
conditions  of such  Governmental  Approvals,  where with respect to each of the
foregoing the failure to obtain or to comply with could be  reasonably  expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect.  Except for any of the following matters that
could not be  reasonably  expected to have a Material  Adverse  Effect,  no Loan
Party is aware of, nor has it  received  notice of, any past or present  events,
conditions,  circumstances,  activities, practices, incidents, actions, or plans
which, with respect to any Loan Party or any other Subsidiary,  may unreasonably
interfere with or prevent compliance or continued  compliance with Environmental
Laws, or may give rise to any common-law or legal liability, based on or related
to the manufacture, processing, distribution, use, treatment, storage, disposal,
transport, or handling or the emission, discharge, release or threatened release
into  the  environment,  of any  Hazardous  Material;  and  there  is no  civil,
criminal, or administrative  action, suit, demand,  claim,  hearing,  notice, or
demand letter, notice of violation,  investigation, or proceeding pending or, to
the Borrower's knowledge after due inquiry,  threatened,  against any Loan Party
or any other  Subsidiary  relating in any way to  Environmental  Laws which,  if
determined  adversely  to such Loan  Party or such  other  Subsidiary,  could be
reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

"investment company" or a company "controlled" by an "investment company" within
the meaning of the Investment  Company Act of 1940, as amended,  (ii) a "holding
company" or a "subsidiary company" of a "holding company",  or an "affiliate" of
a "holding company" or of a "subsidiary company" of a "holding company",  within
the meaning of the Public Utility  Holding  Company Act of 1935, as amended,  or
(iii) subject to any other Applicable Law which purports to regulate or restrict
its  ability  to  borrow  money or  obtain  other  extensions  of  credit  or to
consummate  the  transactions  contemplated  by this Agreement or to perform its
obligations under any Loan Document to which it is a party.

     Margin  Stock.  No Loan  Party  is  engaged  principally,  or as one of its
important  activities,  in the  business of  extending  credit for the  purpose,
whether immediate,  incidental or ultimate, of
                                       66
<PAGE>
buying or carrying  "margin  stock"  within the meaning of  Regulation  U of the
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.

     Affiliate  Transactions.  Except as permitted by Section 10.8,  none of the
Borrower,  any other Loan Party nor any other  Subsidiary is a party to or bound
by any agreement or arrangement (whether oral or written) with any Affiliate.

     Intellectual  Property.  Each of the Loan  Parties owns or has the right to
use,  under valid  license  agreements  or  otherwise,  all  patents,  licenses,
franchises,  trademarks, trademark rights, trade names, trade name rights, trade
secrets and copyrights (collectively,  "Intellectual Property") necessary to the
conduct of its  businesses,  without known  conflict  with any patent,  license,
franchise,  trademark, trade secret, trade name, copyright, or other proprietary
right of any other Person.  All such  Intellectual  Property is fully  protected
and/or duly and properly  registered,  filed or issued in the appropriate office
and jurisdictions for such registrations, filing or issuances. No material claim
has been asserted by any Person with respect to the use of any such Intellectual
Property,  or challenging or questioning  the validity or  effectiveness  of any
such Intellectual Property.

engaged in the business of acquiring, renovating, developing and managing income
producing Properties (consisting primarily of retail Properties),  together with

     Broker's  Fees.  No  broker's  or  finder's  fee,   commission  or  similar
compensation  will be  payable  with  respect to the  transactions  contemplated
hereby.  No other similar fees or commissions  will be payable by any Loan Party
for any other  services  rendered  to any Loan  Party or any other  Subsidiaries
ancillary to the transactions contemplated hereby.

     Accuracy and Completeness of Information. All written information,  reports
and other papers and data  furnished to the  Administrative  Agent or any Lender
by, on behalf of, or at the direction of, the Borrower,  any other Loan Party or
any  other   Subsidiary   were,  at  the  time  of  their  respective  dates  or
certification,  complete  and correct in all  material  respects,  to the extent
necessary  to give the  recipient a true and  accurate  knowledge of the subject
matter, or, in the case of financial  statements,  present fairly, in accordance
with GAAP consistently  applied throughout the periods involved (subject,  as to
interim statements,  to changes resulting from normal year-end audit adjustments
and the exclusion of notes),  the financial  position of the Persons involved as
at the date thereof and the results of operations  for such periods.  No fact is
known to the  Borrower  which has had,  or may in the future have (so far as the
Borrower can reasonably  foresee),  a Material Adverse Effect which has not been
set forth in the financial  statements  referred to in Section 7.1(k) or in such
information,  reports or other papers or data or otherwise  disclosed in writing
to the  Administrative  Agent and the Lenders prior to the Effective  Date.  The
documents  furnished or written statements made to the  Administrative  Agent or
any Lender in connection  with the  negotiation,  preparation  or execution,  or
pursuant to, of this  Agreement or any of the other Loan  Documents,  taken as a
whole,  do  not  contain,   as  of  the  time  of  their   respective  dates  or
certification,  any untrue statement of a fact material to the  creditworthiness
of the  Borrower,  any other Loan Party or any other  Subsidiary or omitted when
                                       67
<PAGE>
furnished  or made to  state a  material  fact  necessary  in  order to make the
statements contained therein not misleading.

     Not Plan Assets; No Prohibited Transactions. None of the assets of any Loan
Party or any other  Subsidiary  constitutes  "plan assets" within the meaning of
ERISA,  the Internal  Revenue Code and the  respective  regulations  promulgated
thereunder,  of any ERISA Plan. The execution,  delivery and  performance of the
Loan Documents by the Loan Parties,  and the borrowing,  other credit extensions
and repayment of amounts thereunder,  do not and will not constitute "prohibited
transactions" under ERISA or the Internal Revenue Code.

     Unencumbered  Pool Properties.  No Person,  other than Borrower or a Person
that is a Guarantor, is the owner of any Unencumbered Pool Property, and each of
the  Unencumbered  Pool Properties  qualifies as an Eligible  Property.  Without
limiting the foregoing, no Unencumbered Pool Property is subject to a Lien other
than a Permitted Lien.

     Survival of Representations and Warranties, Etc.

     All  statements  contained  in any  certificate  required  pursuant to this
Agreement  or any  other  Loan  Document  and  delivered  by or on behalf of the
Borrower to the Administrative  Agent or any Lender (including,  but not limited
to, any such  statement made in or in connection  with any amendment  thereto or
any statement contained in any such certificate or attached financial statement)
shall constitute  representations and warranties made by the Borrower under this
Agreement.  All representations and warranties made under this Agreement and the
other Loan Documents shall be deemed to be made at and as of the Agreement Date,

except for changes in factual  circumstances  specifically  permitted hereunder.
All such  representations and warranties shall survive the effectiveness of this
Agreement,  the execution  and delivery of the Loan  Documents and the making of

consent in the manner  provided for in Section 13.7,  the Borrower  shall comply
with the following covenants:

(including cash  distributions) of capital gains resulting from gains from asset
sales to the extent necessary to avoid payment of taxes on such asset sales; and

personal property that it has sold or leased to another Person.

     Plans.

     The  Borrower  shall not,  and shall not permit any other Loan Party or any

     The  Borrower  shall  not,  and shall not  permit  any other Loan Party to,
amend,  supplement,  restate or otherwise modify its articles of  incorporation,
by-laws or other  organizational  documents without the prior written consent of
the Requisite  Lenders unless such amendment,  supplement,  restatement or other
modification  (a) is in the case of the  Borrower,  to  increase  the  amount of
Equity  Interests  authorized to be issued by the Borrower,  or to authorize the
issuance of a class of Preferred Stock by the Borrower, (b) is required under or
as a result  of the  Internal  Revenue  Code or  other  Applicable  Law,  (c) is

executed and filed, if applicable, copies of any of the foregoing). The Borrower
shall not  permit  Subsidiary  that is not a Loan  Party to  amend,  supplement,
restate or  otherwise  modify its  articles of  incorporation,  by-laws or other

Affiliate of the Borrower or with any director,  officer or employee of any Loan
Party,  except  transactions  in the course of and  pursuant  to the  reasonable
requirements of the business of the Borrower and upon fair and reasonable  terms
that  are no  less  favorable  to the  Borrower  than  would  be  obtained  in a
comparable arm's length  transaction with a Person that is not an Affiliate.  In
limitation  of the  foregoing,  neither  Borrower  nor any other Loan Parties or
Subsidiaries  shall (a) make  loans or  advances  to any  director,  officer  or
employee of any Loan Party or (b)  guaranty  loans or advances to any  director,
officer or employee of any Loan Party,  in either case or cumulatively in excess
of $10,000,000 in the aggregate.  The Borrower and each Subsidiary may, however,
guaranty Indebtedness of other Loan Parties.

     Remedies Upon Event of Default.

     Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default the following  provisions  shall
apply:

     Acceleration; Termination of Facilities.

     Automatic. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default specified in Sections
11.1(e) or 11.1(f),  (A)(i) the principal  of, and all accrued  interest on, the
Loans and the Notes at the time outstanding,  (ii) an amount equal to the Stated
Amount of all Letters of Credit  outstanding as of the date of the occurrence of
such Event of Default and (iii) all of the other  Obligations  of the  Borrower,
including,  but not  limited to, the other  amounts  owed to the Lenders and the
Administrative  Agent under this  Agreement,  the Notes or any of the other Loan
Documents  shall become  immediately  and  automatically  due and payable by the
Borrower without presentment,  demand, protest, or other notice of any kind, all
of which are expressly  waived by the Borrower and (B) the  Commitments  and the
obligation  of the Lenders to make Loans  hereunder,  and the  obligation of the
Administrative Agent to issue Letters of Credit hereunder, shall immediately and
automatically terminate.

     Optional.  If any other Event of Default  shall exist,  the  Administrative
Agent shall,  at the  direction of the  Requisite  Lenders:  (A) declare (1) the
principal  of,  and  accrued  interest  on,  the Loans and the Notes at the time
outstanding,  (2) an amount equal to the Stated  Amount of all Letters of Credit
outstanding  as of the date of the  occurrence  of such Event of Default and (3)
all of the other Obligations,  including,  but not limited to, the other amounts
owed to the Lenders and the Administrative Agent under this Agreement, the Notes
or any of the other Loan  Documents to be forthwith  due and payable,  whereupon
the same shall immediately become due and payable without  presentment,  demand,
protest or other notice of any kind,  all of which are  expressly  waived by the
Borrower and (B) terminate the  Commitments and the obligation of the Lenders to
make Loans  hereunder and the  obligation of the  Administrative  Agent to issue
Letters of Credit hereunder.

     Rescission  of  Acceleration  by  Requisite  Lenders.  If at any time after
acceleration  of the  maturity  of the  Loans  and the  other  Obligations,  the
Borrower  shall pay all  arrears  of  interest  and all  payments  on account of
principal  of the  Obligations  which  shall have become due  otherwise  than by
acceleration  (with  interest  on  principal  and,  to the extent  permitted  by
Applicable Law, on overdue  interest,  at the rates specified in this Agreement)
and all Events of Default and Defaults  (other than  nonpayment  of principal of
and accrued  interest  on the  Obligations  due and payable  solely by virtue of
acceleration)  shall  become  remedied  or  waived  to the  satisfaction  of the
Requisite Lenders, then by written notice to the Borrower, the Requisite Lenders
may elect,  in the sole  discretion of such  Requisite  Lenders,  to rescind and
annul the  acceleration  and its  consequences.  The provisions of the preceding
sentence are intended  merely to bind all of the Lenders to a decision which may
be made at the  election  of the  Requisite  Lenders,  and are not  intended  to
benefit  the  Borrower  and do not give the  Borrower  the right to require  the
Lenders to rescind or annul any acceleration  hereunder,  even if the conditions
set forth herein are satisfied
                                       86

its rights under any and all of the other Loan Documents.

to, and the Administrative Agent if so directed shall, exercise all other rights
and remedies it may have under any Applicable Law.

     Marshaling; Payments Set Aside.

     Neither  the  Administrative  Agent  nor any  Lender  shall  be  under  any
obligation  to marshal  any assets in favor of any Loan Party or any other party
or against or in payment of any or all of the  Obligations.  To the extent  that
any Loan Party makes a payment or payments to the  Administrative  Agent  and/or
any Lender, or the Administrative Agent and/or any Lender enforce their security
interests or exercise  their  rights of setoff,  and such payment or payments or
the proceeds of such  enforcement or setoff or any part thereof are subsequently
invalidated,  declared  to be  fraudulent  or  preferential,  set  aside  and/or
required  to be repaid to a  trustee,  receiver  or any  other  party  under any
bankruptcy law, state or federal law, common law or equitable cause, then to the
extent of such recovery,  the Obligations or part thereof originally intended to
be satisfied,  and all Liens, rights and remedies therefor, shall be revived and
continued  in full force and effect as if such payment had not been made or such
enforcement or setoff had not occurred.

     Allocation of Proceeds.

     If an Event of Default  exists and maturity of any of the  Obligations  has
been accelerated, all payments received by the Administrative Agent under any of
the  Loan  Documents,  in  respect  of  any  principal  of or  interest  on  the
Obligations  or  any  other  amounts  payable  by  the  Borrower   hereunder  or
thereunder, shall be applied in the following order and priority:

                    (a) amounts due to the Administrative  Agent and the Lenders
          in respect of Fees and expenses due under Section 13.2;

                    (b)  payments of  interest  on Loans,  to be applied for the
          ratable benefit of the Lenders;

                    (c) payments of  principal  of Loans,  to be applied for the
          ratable benefit of the Lenders;

                    (d) amounts due to the Administrative  Agent and the Lenders
          pursuant to Sections 12.7 and 13.10;

                    (e) payments of all other  amounts due under any of the Loan
          Documents,  if any,  to be  applied  for the  ratable  benefit  of the
          Lenders; and

                    (f) any  amount  remaining  after  application  as  provided
          above,  shall be paid to the Borrower or whomever  else may be legally
          entitled thereto.

                                       87
<PAGE>
          Letter of Credit Collateral Account.

     As  collateral  security  for the  prompt  payment  in full when due of all
Letter of Credit  Liabilities,  the  Borrower  hereby  pledges and grants to the
Administrative  Agent,  for the  benefit  of the  Administrative  Agent  and the
Lenders as provided herein, a security  interest in all of its right,  title and
interest in and to the Letter of Credit Collateral Account established  pursuant
to the  requirements  of Section 2.12, and the balances from time to time in the
Letter of Credit Collateral Account (including the investments and reinvestments
therein  provided for below).  The  balances  from time to time in the Letter of
Credit Collateral  Account shall not constitute  payment of any Letter of Credit
Liabilities  until  applied  by the  Administrative  Agent as  provided  herein.
Anything in this  Agreement to the contrary  notwithstanding,  funds held in the
Letter of Credit  Collateral  Account  shall be  subject to  withdrawal  only as
provided in this Section and in Section 2.12.

     Amounts  on deposit in the  Letter of Credit  Collateral  Account  shall be
invested and reinvested by the Administrative  Agent in such cash equivalents as
the  Administrative  Agent  shall  determine  in its sole  discretion.  All such
investments and reinvestments shall be held in the name of and be under the sole
dominion and control of the Administrative Agent, provided, that all earnings on
such  investments  will be  credited  to and  retained  in the  Letter of Credit
Collateral Account for the account of Borrower.  The Administrative  Agent shall
exercise  reasonable  care in the custody and  preservation of any funds held in
the Letter of Credit  Collateral  Account and shall be deemed to have  exercised
such care if such funds are accorded treatment substantially  equivalent to that
which  the   Administrative   Agent  accords  other  funds  deposited  with  the
Administrative  Agent, it being understood that the  Administrative  Agent shall
not have any  responsibility  for taking any necessary  steps to preserve rights
against  any  parties  with  respect  to any funds  held in the Letter of Credit
Collateral Account.

     If  an  Event  of  Default  exists,  the  Administrative  Agent  shall,  if
instructed  by the  Requisite  Lenders in their  discretion at any time and from
time to  time,  elect  to  liquidate  any  such  investments  and  reinvestments
referenced in subsection (b) above and credit the proceeds thereof to the Letter
of Credit Collateral  Account and apply or cause to be applied such proceeds and
any other balances in the Letter of Credit Collateral  Account to the payment of
any of the Letter of Credit Liabilities due and payable.

     So long as no Default or Event of Default exists, the Administrative  Agent
shall,  from  time to time,  at the  request  of the  Borrower,  deliver  to the
Borrower,  against receipt but without any recourse,  warranty or representation
whatsoever,  such of the balances in the Letter of Credit Collateral  Account as
exceed the aggregate  amount of Letter of Credit  Liabilities at such time. When
all of the Obligations  shall have been indefeasibly paid in full and no Letters
of Credit  remain  outstanding,  the  Administrative  Agent shall deliver to the
Borrower,  against receipt but without any recourse,  warranty or representation
whatsoever, the balances remaining in the Letter of Credit Collateral Account.

     The Borrower shall pay to the  Administrative  Agent from time to time such
fees as the  Administrative  Agent  normally  charges  for  similar  services in
connection  with the
                                       88
<PAGE>
Administrative Agent's administration of the Letter of Credit Collateral Account
and investments and reinvestments of funds therein.

     Performance by Administrative Agent.

     If the  Borrower  shall fail to perform  any  covenant,  duty or  agreement
contained in any of the Loan Documents,  the Administrative Agent may perform or
attempt to perform  such  covenant,  duty or agreement on behalf of the Borrower
after the  expiration  of any cure or grace  periods set forth  herein.  In such
event, the Borrower shall, at the request of the Administrative  Agent, promptly
reimburse the Administrative  Agent the duly documented,  out-of-pocket costs of
third  parties  engaged  by the  Administrative  Agent  in such  performance  or
attempted   performance  to  the  Administrative   Agent.   Notwithstanding  the
foregoing,  neither  the  Administrative  Agent nor any  Lender  shall  have any
liability or responsibility  whatsoever for the performance of any obligation of
the Borrower under this Agreement or any other Loan Document.

     Rights Cumulative.

     The rights and remedies of the  Administrative  Agent and the Lenders under
this Agreement and each of the other Loan Documents  shall be cumulative and not
exclusive of any rights or remedies  which any of them may otherwise  have under
Applicable  Law.  In  exercising  their  respective   rights  and  remedies  the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders may be selective and no failure or delay by
the  Administrative  Agent or any of the Lenders in  exercising  any right shall
operate as a waiver of it, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any power
or right  preclude  its other or further  exercise or the  exercise of any other
power or right.

                                    THE AGENT

     Authorization and Action.

     Each Lender hereby appoints and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take
such  action  as  contractual  representative  on such  Lender's  behalf  and to
exercise such powers under this  Agreement  and the other Loan  Documents as are
specifically  delegated  to the  Administrative  Agent by the terms  hereof  and
thereof,  together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Not in
limitation  of  the   foregoing,   each  Lender   authorizes   and  directs  the
Administrative  Agent to enter into the Loan  Documents  for the  benefit of the
Lenders.  Each Lender hereby agrees that,  except as otherwise set forth herein,
any action taken by the Requisite  Lenders in accordance  with the provisions of
this Agreement or the Loan Documents,  and the exercise by the Requisite Lenders
of the powers set forth  herein or therein,  together  with such other powers as
are reasonably  incidental thereto,  shall be authorized and binding upon all of
the Lenders.  Nothing herein shall be construed to deem the Administrative Agent
a trustee or fiduciary for any Lender or to impose on the  Administrative  Agent
duties or obligations  other than those expressly  provided for herein.  Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing,  the use of the terms  "Administrative
Agent", "Agent",  "agent" and similar terms in the Loan Documents with reference
to the  Administrative  Agent is not intended to connote any  fiduciary or other
implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any Applicable
Law.  Instead,  use of
                                       89
<PAGE>
such terms is merely a matter of market  custom,  and is  intended  to create or
reflect only an  administrative  relationship  between  independent  contracting
parties.  Except as otherwise  specifically  provided in this Agreement,  at the
request of a Lender, the Administrative Agent will forward to such Lender copies
or,   where   appropriate,   originals  of  the   documents   delivered  to  the
Administrative Agent pursuant to this Agreement or the other Loan Documents. The
Administrative Agent shall deliver to each Lender, promptly upon receipt thereof
by the Administrative Agent, one original of each Note made payable to the order
of such  Lender and copies of each of the  financial  statements,  certificates,
notices and other documents  delivered to the  Administrative  Agent pursuant to
Article IX; provided such delivered documents shall not be deemed to include any
documents  obtained by the  Administrative  Agent from the internet  pursuant to
Sections 9.1, 9.2 or 9.4.(b).  The Administrative Agent will also furnish to any
Lender,  upon the request of such Lender,  a copy of any  certificate  or notice
furnished to the  Administrative  Agent by the  Borrower,  any Loan Party or any
other  Affiliate of the Borrower,  pursuant to this  Agreement or any other Loan
Document  not already  delivered  to such  Lender  pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement  or any such other Loan  Document.  As to any  matters  not  expressly
provided for by the Loan Documents (including,  without limitation,  enforcement
or collection of any of the Obligations),  the Administrative Agent shall not be
required to exercise any discretion or take any action, but shall be required to
act or to refrain  from  acting  (and shall be fully  protected  in so acting or
refraining from acting) upon the  instructions of the Requisite  Lenders (or all
of the  Lenders  if  explicitly  required  under  any  other  provision  of this
Agreement),  and such  instructions  shall be binding  upon all  Lenders and all
holders of any of the  Obligations;  provided,  however,  that,  notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary,  the Administrative  Agent shall not
be  required  to take any  action  which  exposes  the  Administrative  Agent to
personal  liability  or which is  contrary to this  Agreement  or any other Loan
Document  or  Applicable   Law.  Not  in  limitation  of  the   foregoing,   the
Administrative  Agent shall  exercise  any right or remedy it or the Lenders may
have under any Loan  Document  upon the  occurrence  of a Default or an Event of
Default  unless the  Requisite  Lenders have directed the  Administrative  Agent
otherwise.  Without  limiting the  foregoing,  no Lender shall have any right of
action  whatsoever  against  the  Administrative   Agent  as  a  result  of  the
Administrative  Agent acting or refraining  from acting under this  Agreement or
any of the other Loan  Documents  in  accordance  with the  instructions  of the
Requisite Lenders, or where applicable, all the Lenders.

                  Administrative Agent's Reliance, Etc.

     Notwithstanding  any other  provisions of this  Agreement or any other Loan
Documents, neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its directors,  officers,
agents,  employees or counsel  shall be liable for any action taken or not taken
by it under or in  connection  with this  Agreement or any other Loan  Document,
except for its or their own gross negligence or willful misconduct in connection
with its duties  expressly  set forth  herein or therein.  Without  limiting the
generality of the foregoing,  the  Administrative  Agent: may consult with legal
counsel (including its own counsel or counsel for the Borrower or any other Loan
Party),  independent  public  accountants and other experts  selected by it with
reasonable  care and shall not be liable for any  action  taken or omitted to be
taken  in good  faith  by it in  accordance  with the  advice  of such  counsel,
accountants  or  experts.  Neither  the  Administrative  Agent  nor  any  of its
directors,  officers,  agents,  employees or counsel:  (a) makes any warranty or
representation to any Lender or any other Person and shall be responsible to any
Lender or any other Person for any statement,

                                       90
<PAGE>
warranty or representation  made or deemed made by the Borrower,  any other Loan
Party or any other Person in or in connection  with this  Agreement or any other
Loan  Document;  (b) shall  have any duty to  ascertain  or to inquire as to the
performance  or observance of any of the terms,  covenants or conditions of this
Agreement  or any other Loan  Document  or the  satisfaction  of any  conditions
precedent  under this Agreement or any Loan Document on the part of the Borrower
or other  Persons or inspect the  property,  books or records of the Borrower or
any other Person;  (c) shall be responsible to any Lender for the due execution,
legality, validity,  enforceability,  genuineness,  sufficiency or value of this
Agreement or any other Loan Document, any other instrument or document furnished
pursuant thereto or any Collateral covered thereby or the perfection or priority
of any Lien in favor of the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lenders in any
such  Collateral;  (d) shall have any  liability  in  respect  of any  recitals,
statements,  certifications,  representations or warranties  contained in any of
the Loan Documents or any other document, instrument,  agreement, certificate or
statement delivered in connection  therewith;  and (e) shall incur any liability
under or in respect of this  Agreement or any other Loan Document by acting upon
any notice, consent, certificate or other instrument or writing (which may be by
telephone, telecopy or electronic mail) believed by it to be genuine and signed,
sent or given by the  proper  party or  parties.  The  Administrative  Agent may
execute  any of its  duties  under  the Loan  Documents  by or  through  agents,
employees or  attorneys-in-fact  and shall not be responsible for the negligence
or misconduct of any agent or  attorney-in-fact  that it selects with reasonable
care in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct.

     Notice of Defaults.

     The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of
the occurrence of a Default or Event of Default unless the Administrative  Agent
has received  notice from a Lender or the Borrower  referring to this Agreement,
describing  with  reasonable  specificity  such  Default or Event of Default and
stating  that such notice is a "notice of default or event of  default."  If any
Lender (excluding the Lender which is also serving as the Administrative  Agent)
becomes aware of any Default or Event of Default,  it shall promptly send to the
Administrative  Agent with a copy to Borrower such a "notice of default or event
of default."  Further,  if the  Administrative  Agent receives such a "notice of
default",  the  Administrative  Agent  shall give prompt  notice  thereof to the
Lenders with a copy to Borrower.

     Wells Fargo as Lender.

     Wells  Fargo,  as a "Lender",  shall have the same rights and powers  under
this  Agreement and any other Loan Document as any other Lender and may exercise
the same as though it were not the  Administrative  Agent; and the term "Lender"
or "Lenders" shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated, include Wells Fargo in
each case in its  individual  capacity.  Wells Fargo and its affiliates may each
accept deposits from,  maintain deposits or credit balances for, invest in, lend
money to, act as trustee under indentures of, serve as financial advisor to, and
generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower, any other Loan Party
or any other affiliate thereof as if it were any other bank and without any duty
to account therefor to the other Lenders.  Further, the Administrative Agent and
any  affiliate  may accept fees and other  consideration  from the  Borrower for
services in  connection  with this  Agreement and  otherwise  without  having to
account  for the  same to the  other  Lenders.  The  Lenders  acknowledge  that,
                                       91
<PAGE>
pursuant  to  such  activities,  Wells  Fargo  or  its  affiliates  may  receive
information regarding the Borrower,  other Loan Parties,  other Subsidiaries and
other Affiliates  (including  information that may be subject to confidentiality
obligations  in favor of such Person) and  acknowledge  that the  Administrative
Agent shall be under no obligation to provide such information to them.

     Approvals of Lenders.

     All communications  from the Administrative  Agent to any Lender requesting
such Lender's determination, consent, approval or disapproval (a) shall be given
in the form of a written  notice to such Lender,  (b) shall be  accompanied by a
description  of the  matter or issue as to which such  determination,  approval,
consent  or  disapproval  is  requested,  or  shall  advise  such  Lender  where
information,  if any, regarding such matter or issue may be inspected,  or shall
otherwise  describe the matter or issue to be resolved,  (c) shall  include,  if
reasonably requested by such Lender and to the extent not previously provided to
such Lender, written materials and a summary of all oral information provided to
the Administrative Agent by the Borrower in respect of the matter or issue to be
resolved, and (d) shall include the Administrative Agent's recommended course of
action or determination  in respect  thereof.  Each Lender shall reply promptly,
but in any event within ten (10) Business Days of receipt of such  communication
(or such  lesser  period as may be  required  under the Loan  Documents  for the
Administrative  Agent to respond).  Unless a Lender shall give written notice to
the Administrative  Agent that it specifically  objects to the recommendation or
determination of the Administrative  Agent (together with a written  explanation
of the reasons  behind such  objection)  within the  applicable  time period for
reply, such Lender shall be deemed to have conclusively approved of or consented
to such recommendation or determination.

     Lender Credit Decision, Etc.

     Each  Lender   expressly   acknowledges   and  agrees   that   neither  the
Administrative  Agent nor any of its  officers,  directors,  employees,  agents,
counsel,  attorneys-in-fact  or other affiliates has made any representations or
warranties as to the financial condition, operations, creditworthiness, solvency
or other  information  concerning  the business or affairs of the Borrower,  any
other Loan Party,  any Subsidiary or any other Person to such Lender and that no
act by the Administrative  Agent hereinafter taken,  including any review of the
affairs of the Borrower,  shall be deemed to constitute any such  representation
or warranty by the Administrative  Agent to any Lender. Each Lender acknowledges
that it has,  independently and without reliance upon the Administrative  Agent,
any  other  Lender  or  counsel  to the  Administrative  Agent,  or any of their
respective officers, directors, employees and agents, and based on the financial
statements of the Borrower, the Subsidiaries or any other Affiliate thereof, and
inquiries of such  Persons,  its  independent  due diligence of the business and
affairs of the Borrower,  the Loan Parties,  the Subsidiaries and other Persons,
its review of the Loan Documents, the legal opinions required to be delivered to
it  hereunder,  the  advice of its own  counsel  and such  other  documents  and
information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit and legal analysis
and  decision  to enter into this  Agreement  and the  transaction  contemplated
hereby.  Each Lender also acknowledges  that it will,  independently and without
reliance  upon the  Administrative  Agent,  any other  Lender or  counsel to the
Administrative Agent or any of their respective officers,  directors,  employees
and agents,  and based on such review,
                                       92
<PAGE>
advice,  documents and  information  as it shall deem  appropriate  at the time,
continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under the Loan
Documents.  Except for  notices,  reports and other  documents  and  information
expressly  required to be furnished to the Lenders by the  Administrative  Agent
under this  Agreement  or any of the other Loan  Documents,  the  Administrative
Agent shall have no duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit
or other information concerning the business,  operations,  property,  financial
and other condition or creditworthiness of the Borrower, any other Loan Party or
any other Affiliate thereof which may come into possession of the Administrative
Agent or any of its officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or
other Affiliates. Each Lender acknowledges that the Administrative Agent's legal
counsel in connection  with the  transactions  contemplated by this Agreement is
only acting as counsel to the Administrative  Agent and is not acting as counsel
to such Lender.

     Indemnification of Administrative Agent.

     Each Lender agrees to indemnify the Administrative Agent (to the extent not
reimbursed by the Borrower and without  limiting the  obligation of the Borrower
to do so) pro rata in accordance  with such Lender's  respective Pro Rata Share,
from  and  against  any  and  all  liabilities,  obligations,  losses,  damages,
penalties,  actions,  judgments,  suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any
kind or nature  whatsoever  which may at any time be imposed on, incurred by, or
asserted  against the  Administrative  Agent (in its capacity as  Administrative
Agent but not as a "Lender")  in any way  relating to or arising out of the Loan
Documents, any transaction contemplated hereby or thereby or any action taken or
omitted by the  Administrative  Agent  under the Loan  Documents  (collectively,
"Indemnifiable Amounts");  provided, however, that no Lender shall be liable for
any  portion of such  Indemnifiable  Amounts to the  extent  resulting  from the
Administrative  Agent's  gross  negligence  or  willful  misconduct  or  if  the
Administrative  Agent fails to follow the  written  direction  of the  Requisite
Lenders  unless  such  failure is pursuant to the advice of counsel of which the
Lenders have received notice.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
each Lender agrees to reimburse the  Administrative  Agent  promptly upon demand
for its ratable share of any out-of-pocket  expenses  (including counsel fees of
the  counsel(s)  of the  Administrative  Agent's own  choosing)  incurred by the
Administrative Agent in connection with the preparation, negotiation, execution,
administration, or enforcement of, or legal advice with respect to the rights or
responsibilities  of the parties under,  the Loan Documents,  any suit or action
brought by the  Administrative  Agent to enforce the terms of the Loan Documents
and/or collect any  Obligations,  any "lender  liability"  suit or claim brought
against  the  Administrative  Agent  and/or the  Lenders,  and any claim or suit
brought  against the  Administrative  Agent and/or the Lenders arising under any
Environmental  Laws,  to  the  extent  that  the  Administrative  Agent  is  not
reimbursed  for such  expenses  by the  Borrower.  Such  out-of-pocket  expenses
(including  counsel fees) shall be advanced by the Lenders on the request of the
Administrative   Agent   notwithstanding   any  claim  or  assertion   that  the
Administrative  Agent is not entitled to indemnification  hereunder upon receipt
of an undertaking by the Administrative Agent that the Administrative Agent will
reimburse  the Lenders if it is actually  and finally  determined  by a court of
competent  jurisdiction  that the  Administrative  Agent is not so  entitled  to
indemnification. The agreements in this Section shall survive the payment of the
Loans and all other amounts payable  hereunder or under the other Loan Documents
and the termination of this Agreement.
                                       93

     Successor Administrative Agent.

     The  Administrative  Agent may resign at any time as  Administrative  Agent
under the Loan Documents by giving written notice thereof to the Lenders and the
Borrower. In the event (a) of Administrative Agent's gross negligence or willful
misconduct or (b)  Administrative  Agent, at any time,  ceases to maintain a Pro
Rata Share equal to or greater than the Pro Rata Share of each other Lender, the
Administrative  Agent may be  removed  as  Administrative  Agent  under the Loan
Documents at any time by Requisite Lenders (other than the Administrative  Agent
as a "Lender") upon thirty (30) day's prior notice. Upon any such resignation or
removal,  the  Requisite  Lenders  (which,  in the  case of the  removal  of the
Administrative Agent as provided in the immediately preceding sentence, shall be
determined  without  regard  to the  Commitment  of the  Lender  then  acting as
Administrative Agent) shall have the right to appoint a successor Administrative
Agent which appointment  shall,  provided no Default or Event of Default exists,
be subject to the Borrower's approval,  which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed (except that the Borrower shall, in all events, be deemed to
have approved each Lender as a successor  Administrative Agent). If no successor
Administrative  Agent  shall  have  been so  appointed  in  accordance  with the
immediately preceding sentence, and shall have accepted such appointment, within
thirty (30) days after the resigning  Administrative Agent's giving of notice of
resignation or the Lenders' removal of the resigning  Administrative Agent, then
the  resigning  or removed  Administrative  Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders,
appoint a successor Administrative Agent, which shall be a Lender, if any Lender
shall be willing to serve, and otherwise shall be an Eligible Assignee. Upon the
acceptance of any appointment as  Administrative  Agent hereunder by a successor
Administrative  Agent,  such  successor  Administrative  Agent  shall  thereupon
succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers,  privileges and duties
of the retiring  Administrative  Agent,  and the retiring  Administrative  Agent
shall be discharged  from its duties and  obligations  under the Loan Documents.
After  any   Administrative   Agent's   resignation  or  removal   hereunder  as
Administrative Agent, the provisions of this Article XII shall continue to inure
to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was
Administrative Agent under the Loan Documents.

     Titled Agents.

     Each of the  Documentation  Agents  (each a  "Titled  Agent")  in each such
respective  capacity,   assumes  no  responsibility  or  obligation   hereunder,
including,  without limitation, for servicing,  enforcement or collection of any
of the Loans,  nor any duties as an agent hereunder for the Lenders.  The titles
given  to the  Titled  Agents  are  solely  honorific  and  imply  no  fiduciary
responsibility on the part of the Titled Agents to the Administrative Agent, any
Lender, the Borrower or any other Loan Party and the use of such titles does not
impose on the Titled Agents any duties or obligations  greater than those of any
other  Lender or  entitle  the Titled  Agents to any rights  other than those to
which any other Lender is entitled.

          Administrative  Agent  or  any  Lender  under  Article  II.  shall  be
          effective  only when  actually  received.  Neither the  Administrative
          Agent nor any Lender shall incur any  liability  to the Borrower  (nor
          shall the Administrative Agent incur any liability to the Lenders) for
          acting upon any telephonic  notice referred to in this Agreement which
          the Administrative  Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, believes
          in good  faith to have been  given by a Person  authorized  to deliver
          such  notice or for  otherwise  acting in good  faith  hereunder.  The
          failure of any Person  designated to receive only a copy of any notice
          shall not render  ineffective  notice otherwise  properly given to the
          Person to receive such notice.

in  connection  with the  preparation,  negotiation  and  execution  of, and any
amendment,  supplement or modification to, any of the Loan Documents  (including
due diligence  expense and reasonable  travel expenses related to closing),  and

     THE  CHOICE  OF FORUM  SET  FORTH IN THIS  SECTION  SHALL  NOT BE DEEMED TO
PRECLUDE THE BRINGING OF ANY ACTION BY THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT OR ANY LENDER OR
THE  ENFORCEMENT  BY THE  ADMINISTRATIVE  AGENT OR ANY  LENDER  OF ANY  JUDGMENT
OBTAINED IN SUCH FORUM IN ANY OTHER APPROPRIATE JURISDICTION.

     THE BORROWER AGREES THAT ALL OF ITS PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS  HEREUNDER SHALL BE
ABSOLUTE AND UNCONDITIONAL,  AND, FOR THE PURPOSES OF AND WITH RESPECT TO MAKING
PAYMENTS  HEREUNDER,  THE BORROWER HEREBY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO ASSERT ANY SETOFF,
COUNTERCLAIM OR CROSS-CLAIM.

     THE FOREGOING  WAIVERS HAVE BEEN MADE WITH THE ADVICE OF COUNSEL AND WITH A
FULL  UNDERSTANDING  OF THE LEGAL  CONSEQUENCES  THEREOF,  AND SHALL SURVIVE THE
PAYMENT OF THE LOANS AND ALL OTHER AMOUNTS PAYABLE  HEREUNDER OR UNDER THE OTHER
LOAN  DOCUMENTS,  THE TERMINATION OR EXPIRATION OF ALL LETTERS OF CREDIT AND THE
TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT.

     Successors and Assigns.

     Generally. The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
to the  benefit  of the  parties  hereto  and their  respective  successors  and
assigns,  except that the Borrower  may not assign or otherwise  transfer any of
its rights under this  Agreement  without the prior  written  consent of all the
Lenders  (and any such  assignment  or transfer to which all of the Lenders have
not consented shall be void).

     Participations.  Any Lender may at any time grant to an  affiliate  of such
Lender,  or  one  or  more  banks  or  other  financial   institutions  (each  a
"Participant"  )  participating  interests in its Commitment or the  Obligations
owing to such Lender, provided, however, any such participating interest must be
for a  constant  and not a varying  percentage  interest.  Except  as  otherwise
provided in Section 3.3, no Participant  shall have any rights or benefits under
this Agreement or any other Loan  Document.  In the event of any such grant by a
Lender of a  participating  interest to a Participant,  such Lender shall remain
responsible for the performance of its obligations  hereunder,  and the Borrower
and the  Administrative  Agent shall  continue to deal solely and directly  with
such Lender in connection with such Lender's  rights and obligations  under this
Agreement.  Any  agreement  pursuant  to  which  any  Lender  may  grant  such a
participating  interest  shall  provide  that such Lender  shall retain the sole
right and  responsibility  to enforce the obligations of the Borrower  hereunder
including, without limitation, the right to approve any amendment,  modification
or waiver of any provision of this Agreement;  provided however, such Lender may
agree  with  the  Participant  that it will  not,  without  the  consent  of the
Participant,  agree to (i) increase  such Lender's  Commitment,  (ii) extend the
date fixed for the payment of principal on the Loans or portions  thereof  owing
to such Lender,  or (iii) reduce the
                                       98
<PAGE>
rate at which interest is payable thereon. An assignment or other transfer which
is not  permitted  by  subsection  (c) or (d) below  shall be given  effect  for
purposes  of this  Agreement  only to the  extent  of a  participating  interest
granted in accordance with this subsection (b).

     Assignments.  Any  Lender  may  with  the  prior  written  consent  of  the
Administrative  Agent and the Borrower (which consent in each case, shall not be
unreasonably  withheld)  at any time  assign to one or more  Eligible  Assignees
(each an "Assignee") all or a portion of its rights and  obligations  under this
Agreement and the Notes; provided,  however, (i) no such consent by the Borrower
shall be required (x) if a Default or Event of Default shall exist or (y) in the
case of an assignment to another Lender or an affiliate of another Lender;  (ii)
any partial  assignment  shall be in an amount at least equal to $10,000,000 and
after  giving  effect  to  such  assignment  the  assigning   Lender  retains  a
Commitment,  or if the Commitments have been  terminated,  holds Notes having an
aggregate outstanding principal balance, of at least $15,000,000, and (iii) each
such  assignment  shall be effected  by means of an  Assignment  and  Acceptance
Agreement. From and after the Assignment Effective Date (as such term is defined
in the Assignment and  Agreement),  such Assignee shall be deemed to be a Lender
party to this  Agreement  and shall  have all the rights  and  obligations  of a
Lender  with a  Commitment  as set  forth  in  such  Assignment  and  Acceptance
Agreement,  and the  transferor  Lender shall be released  from its  obligations
hereunder to a  corresponding  extent,  and no further  consent or action by any
party shall be required.  Upon the  consummation  of any assignment  pursuant to
this subsection (c), the transferor  Lender,  the  Administrative  Agent and the
Borrower shall make  appropriate  arrangement so the new Notes are issued to the
Assignee and such transferor Lender, as appropriate. In connection with any such
assignment,  the  transferor  Lender  shall pay to the  Administrative  Agent an
administrative  fee for  processing  such  assignment  in the  amount of $3,500.
Anything in this Section to the contrary  notwithstanding,  no Lender may assign
or participate any interest in any Loan held by it hereunder to the Borrower, or
any of its respective affiliates or Subsidiaries.

     Designated  Lenders.  Any Lender (each, a "Designating  Lender") may at any
time  designate one  Designated  Lender to fund Bid Rate Loans on behalf of such
Designating  Lender  subject  to the  terms  of  this  subsection  (d)  and  the
provisions in the immediately  preceding subsections (b) and (c) shall not apply
to such designation.  No Lender may designate more than one Designated Lender at
any point in time.  The  parties  to each such  designation  shall  execute  and
deliver to the Administrative Agent for its acceptance a Designation  Agreement.
Upon such receipt of an appropriately  completed  Designation Agreement executed
by a  Designating  Lender and a designee  representing  that it is a  Designated
Lender, the Administrative Agent will accept such Designation Agreement and give
prompt notice thereof to the Borrower, whereupon, (i) the Borrower shall execute
and deliver to the  Designating  Lender a Designated  Lender Note payable to the
order of the Designated Lender, (ii) from and after the effective date specified
in the Designation Agreement, the Designated Lender shall become a party to this
Agreement  with a right to make Bid Rate  Loans  on  behalf  of its  Designating
Lender  pursuant to Section 2.4 after the  Borrower has accepted a Bid Rate Loan
(or portion thereof) of the Designating  Lender, and (iii) the Designated Lender
shall not be required to make payments with respect to any  obligations  in this
Agreement  except to the extent of excess  cash flow of such  Designated  Lender
which is not otherwise  required to repay  obligations of such Designated Lender
which are then due and  payable;  provided,  however,  that  regardless  of such
designation  and assumption by the
                                       99
<PAGE>
Designated  Lender,  the Designating Lender shall be and remain obligated to the
Borrower,  the  Administrative  Agent and the  Lenders for each and every of the
obligations of the  Designating  Lender and its related  Designated  Lender with
respect to this Agreement,  including,  without limitation,  any indemnification
obligations under Section 12.7 and any sums otherwise payable to the Borrower by
the Designated  Lender.  Each Designating Lender shall serve as the agent of the
Designated  Lender  and  shall  on  behalf  of,  and to the  exclusion  of,  the
Designated  Lender: (i) receive any and all payments made for the benefit of the
Designated Lender and (ii) give and receive all  communications  and notices and
take all actions hereunder,  including,  without limitation,  votes,  approvals,
waivers,  consents and  amendments  under or relating to this  Agreement and the
other Loan Documents. Any such notice,  communication,  vote, approval,  waiver,
consent or amendment shall be signed by the Designating  Lender as agent for the
Designated  Lender and shall not be signed by the  Designated  Lender on its own
behalf and shall be binding on the  Designated  Lender to the same  extent as if
signed  by  the  Designated  Lender  on  its  own  behalf.  The  Borrower,   the
Administrative  Agent and the Lenders may rely thereon  without any  requirement
that the Designated  Lender sign or acknowledge  the same. No Designated  Lender
may assign or transfer all or any portion of its interest hereunder or under any
other Loan  Document,  other than  assignments to the  Designating  Lender which
originally designated such Designated Lender. The Borrower,  the Lenders and the
Administrative  Agent each hereby agrees that it will not institute  against any
Designated Lender or join any other Person in instituting against any Designated
Lender any bankruptcy,  reorganization,  arrangement,  insolvency or liquidation
proceeding under any federal or state bankruptcy or similar law, until the later
to occur of (x) one year and one day after  the  payment  in full of the  latest
maturing  commercial  paper note  issued by such  Designated  Lender and (y) the
Termination Date. In connection with any such designation the Designating Lender
shall pay to the Administrative  Agent an administrative fee for processing such
designation in the amount of $3,500.

     Federal  Reserve  Bank  Assignments.  In  addition to the  assignments  and
participations  permitted  under the foregoing  provisions of this Section 13.6,
and without the need to comply with any of the formal or procedural requirements
of this Section 13.6,  any Lender may at any time and from time to time,  pledge
and  assign  all or any  portion  of its  rights  under  all or any of the  Loan
Documents to a Federal Reserve Bank;  provided that no such pledge of assignment
shall release such Lender from its obligation thereunder. To facilitate any such
pledge or assignment, Administrative Agent shall, at the request of such Lender,
enter into a letter agreement with the Federal Reserve Bank in, or substantially
in, the form of the  exhibit to Appendix C to the  Federal  Reserve  Bank of New
York  Operating  Circular No 10, as amended from time to time. No such pledge or
assignment shall release the assigning Lender from its obligations hereunder.

     Information  to  Assignee,  Etc.  A  Lender  may  furnish  any  information
concerning  the  Borrower,  any  Subsidiary  or  any  other  Loan  Party  in the
possession  of such  Lender  from  time to time to  Assignees  and  Participants
(including   prospective   Assignees  and   Participants);   provided  that  the
information  concerning  Borrower,  any other Loan Party or Subsidiary  shall be
subject to Section 13.9.
                                      100

     Amendments.

     Generally.  Except as otherwise  expressly provided in this Agreement,  (i)
any consent or approval  required or permitted by this  Agreement or in any Loan
Document  to be  given  by the  Lenders  may be  given,  (ii)  any  term of this
Agreement  or of any other  Loan  Document  (other  than any fee  letter  solely
between the Borrower  and the  Administrative  Agent) may be amended,  (iii) the
performance  or  observance by the Borrower or any other Loan Party of any terms
of this Agreement or such other Loan Document  (other than any fee letter solely
between the Borrower and the  Administrative  Agent) may be waived, and (iv) the
continuance of any Default or Event of Default may be waived  (either  generally
or in a particular instance and either retroactively or prospectively) with, but
only with, the written consent of the Requisite  Lenders (or the  Administrative
Agent at the written direction of the Requisite Lenders), and, in the case of an
amendment to any Loan Document,  the written consent of each Loan Party which is
party thereto.

     Unanimous Consent.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no amendment,  waiver or
consent  shall,  unless in  writing,  and signed by all of the  Lenders  (or the
Administrative  Agent at the written  direction of the  Lenders),  do any of the
following:

     increase the Commitments of the Lenders (excluding any increase as a result
of an assignment  of  Commitments  permitted  under Section 13.6) or subject the
Lenders to any  additional  obligations,  except for any increases  contemplated
under Section 2.14;

     reduce the principal  of, or interest  rates that have accrued or that will
be  charged  on  the  outstanding  principal  amount  of,  any  Loans  or  other
Obligations;

     reduce the amount of any Fees payable to the Lenders hereunder,  other than
Fees payable to Administrative Agent pursuant to the Fee Letter;

     postpone  any date fixed for any payment of  principal  of, or interest on,
any Loans or for the payment of Fees (other  than Fees to  Administrative  Agent
pursuant to the Fee Letter) or any other  Obligations,  or extend the expiration
date of any Letter of Credit beyond the Termination Date;

     change  the Pro  Rata  Shares  (excluding  any  change  as a  result  of an
assignment  of  Commitments  permitted  under  Section  13.6 or an  increase  of
Commitments effected pursuant to Section 2.14);

     amend this Section 13.7 or amend the  definitions of the terms used in this
Agreement or the other Loan  Documents  insofar as such  definitions  affect the
substance of this Section 13.7;

     modify the  definition  of the term  "Requisite  Lenders"  or modify in any
other  manner the  number or  percentage  of the  Lenders  required  to make any
determinations or waive any rights hereunder or to modify any provision hereof;

     release any Guarantor  from its  obligations  under the Guaranty  except as
contemplated under Section 8.14;

                                      101
<PAGE>

     modify the  definitions  of the terms "Gross Asset Value",  "Indebtedness",
"Maximum   Availability",   "Total   Liabilities",    "Unencumbered   Pool"   or
"Unencumbered  Pool Value" (or the  definitions  used in such  definition or the

     modify or amend the  financial  covenant set forth in Section  10.1(b),  or
waive any Default or Event of Default under such Section 10.1(b);

     waive a Default  or Event of  Default  under  Section  11.1(a)  or  Section
11.1(l)(i); or

     amend, or waive the Borrower's compliance with, Section 2.8(b)(ii).

     Amendment of Administrative  Agent's Duties,  Etc. No amendment,  waiver or
consent unless in writing and signed by the Administrative Agent, in addition to
the Lenders required hereinabove to take such action, shall affect the rights or
duties of the Administrative Agent under this Agreement or any of the other Loan
Documents.  Any  amendment,  waiver or consent  relating  to Section  2.3 or the
obligations  of the  Swingline  Lender  under this  Agreement  or any other Loan
Document  shall,  in addition to the Lenders  required  hereinabove to take such
action,  require the written  consent of the Swingline  Lender.  No waiver shall
extend to or affect  any  obligation  not  expressly  waived or impair any right
consequent thereon and any amendment,  waiver or consent shall be effective only
in the  specific  instance and for the specific  purpose set forth  therein.  No
course of dealing or delay or omission on the part of the  Administrative  Agent
or any Lender in  exercising  any right  shall  operate  as a waiver  thereof or
otherwise be prejudicial thereto. Any Event of Default occurring hereunder shall
continue  to exist until such time as such Event of Default is waived in writing
in accordance with the terms of this Section, notwithstanding any attempted cure
or other  action by the  Borrower,  any  other  Loan  Party or any other  Person
subsequent  to the  occurrence  of such Event of  Default.  Except as  otherwise
explicitly  provided for herein or in any other Loan  Document,  no notice to or
demand upon the Borrower  shall entitle the Borrower to other or further  notice
or demand in similar or other circumstances.

     Nonliability of Administrative Agent and Lenders.

     The relationship between the Borrower, on the one hand, and the Lenders and
the  Administrative  Agent, on the other hand,  shall be solely that of borrower
and  lender.  Neither  the  Administrative  Agent nor any Lender  shall have any
fiduciary responsibilities to the Borrower and no provision in this Agreement or
in any of the other Loan  Documents,  and no course of dealing  between or among
any of the parties hereto, shall be deemed to create any fiduciary duty owing by
the  Administrative  Agent  or any  Lender  to any  Lender,  the  Borrower,  any
Subsidiary  or any other Loan Party.  Neither the  Administrative  Agent nor any
Lender  undertakes  any  responsibility  to the Borrower to review or inform the
Borrower of any matter in connection  with any phase of the Borrower's  business
or operations.

     Confidentiality.

     Except as otherwise  provided by Applicable Law, the  Administrative  Agent
and each Lender shall utilize all non-public  information  obtained  pursuant to
the  requirements of this Agreement which has been identified as confidential or
proprietary  by the Borrower in
                                      102
<PAGE>
accordance with its customary procedure for handling confidential information of
this nature and in accordance  with safe and sound banking  practices but in any
event may make disclosure:  (a) to any of their respective  affiliates (provided
any  such  affiliate  shall  agree  to keep  such  information  confidential  in
accordance with the terms of this Section 13.9); (b) as reasonably  requested by
any bona fide Assignee,  Participant or other  transferee in connection with the
contemplated  transfer of any Commitment or participations  therein as permitted
hereunder  (provided they shall agree to keep such  information  confidential in
accordance with the terms of this Section);  (c) as required or requested by any
Governmental Authority or representative thereof or pursuant to legal process or
in connection with any legal proceedings;  (d) to the Administrative  Agent's or
such Lender's  independent  auditors and other  professional  advisors (provided
they shall be notified of the confidential nature of the information); (e) if an
Event of Default exists, to any other Person,  but solely in connection with the
exercise by the Administrative Agent or the Lenders of their rights hereunder or
under any of the other Loan  Documents;  and (f) to the extent such  information
(x)  becomes  publicly  available  other  than as a result  of a breach  of this
Section 13.9 or (y) becomes available to the Administrative  Agent or any Lender
on a  nonconfidential  basis  from a  source  other  than  the  Borrower  or any
Affiliate.

     Indemnification.

     The Borrower shall and hereby agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless
the Administrative  Agent, any affiliate of the Administrative Agent and each of
the Lenders and their  respective  directors,  officers,  shareholders,  agents,
employees and counsel (each referred to herein as an  "Indemnified  Party") from
and  against  any  and  all  losses,   costs,  claims,   damages,   liabilities,
deficiencies, judgments or expenses of every kind and nature (including, without
limitation,  amounts paid in settlement, court costs and the reasonable and duly
documented  fees and  disbursements  of counsel  incurred in connection with any
litigation,  investigation,  claim  or  proceeding  or any  advice  rendered  in
connection  therewith)  incurred by an  Indemnified  Party in  connection  with,
arising out of, or by reason of, any suit, cause of action, claim,  arbitration,
investigation  or settlement,  consent decree or other proceeding (the foregoing
referred  to herein as an  "Indemnity  Proceeding")  which is in any way related
directly or indirectly  to: (i) this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the
transactions  contemplated  thereby; (ii) the making of any Loans or issuance of
Letters of Credit hereunder; (iii) any actual or proposed use by the Borrower of
the proceeds of the Loans or Letters of Credit; (iv) the Administrative  Agent's
or  any  Lender's   entering  into  this  Agreement;   (v)  the  fact  that  the
Administrative  Agent and the  Lenders  have  established  the  credit  facility
evidenced hereby in favor of the Borrower; (vi) the fact that the Administrative
Agent and the Lenders are  creditors  of the Borrower and have or are alleged to
have information regarding the financial condition,  strategic plans or business
operations  of the  Borrower  and the  Subsidiaries;  (vii)  the  fact  that the
Administrative  Agent and the Lenders are material creditors of the Borrower and
are alleged to  influence  directly or  indirectly  the  business  decisions  or
affairs of the  Borrower  and the  Subsidiaries  or their  financial  condition;
(viii)  the  exercise  of any right or remedy  the  Administrative  Agent or the
Lenders may have under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents including, but
not limited to, the  foreclosure  upon,  or seizure  of, any  collateral  or the
exercise  of any  other  rights  of a  secured  party;  (ix)  any  violation  or
non-compliance  by  the  Borrower  or  any  Subsidiary  of  any  Applicable  Law
(including any Environmental  Law) including,  but not limited to, any Indemnity
Proceeding  commenced  by (A) the  Internal  Revenue  Service  or  state  taxing
authority  or  (B)  any
                                      103
<PAGE>
Governmental  Authority or other Person under any Environmental  Law,  including
any Indemnity Proceeding  commenced by a Governmental  Authority or other Person
seeking  remedial or other action to cause the Borrower or its  Subsidiaries (or
its respective  properties) (or the  Administrative  Agent and/or the Lenders as
successors to the Borrower) to be in compliance  with such  Environmental  Laws;
provided,  however,  that the Borrower  shall not be obligated to indemnify  any
Indemnified  Party  for any  acts or  omissions  of such  Indemnified  party  in
connection  with  matters  described  in this clause (a) that  constitute  gross
negligence or willful misconduct.

     The Borrower's  indemnification  obligations under this Section shall apply
to all  Indemnity  Proceedings  arising  out of, or related  to,  the  foregoing
whether  or  not an  Indemnified  Party  is a  named  party  in  such  Indemnity
Proceeding.  In this connection,  this indemnification shall cover all costs and
expenses of any  Indemnified  Party in  connection  with any  deposition  of any
Indemnified  Party or  compliance  with any  subpoena  (including  any  subpoena
requesting the production of documents). This indemnification shall, among other
things,  apply to any Indemnity  Proceeding  commenced by other creditors of the
Borrower or any  Subsidiary,  any  shareholder of the Borrower or any Subsidiary
(whether such shareholder(s) are prosecuting such Indemnity  Proceeding in their
individual  capacity or  derivatively  on behalf of the  Borrower),  any account
debtor of the Borrower or any Subsidiary or by any Governmental Authority.

     This indemnification shall apply to any Indemnity Proceeding arising during
the  pendency of any  bankruptcy  proceeding  filed by or against  the  Borrower
and/or any Subsidiary.

     All   out-of-pocket   fees  and  expenses  of,  and  all  amounts  paid  to
third-persons  by, an  Indemnified  Party shall be reimbursed by the Borrower at
the request of such Indemnified Party  notwithstanding any claim or assertion by
the Borrower  that such  Indemnified  Party is not  entitled to  indemnification
hereunder  upon receipt of an undertaking  by such  Indemnified  Party that such
Indemnified  Party will  reimburse  the  Borrower if it is actually  and finally
determined by a court of competent  jurisdiction  that such Indemnified Party is
not so entitled to indemnification hereunder.

     An Indemnified  Party may conduct its own investigation and defense of, and
may formulate its own strategy with respect to, any Indemnity Proceeding covered
by this Section and, as provided above, all costs and expenses  incurred by such
Indemnified Party shall be reimbursed by the Borrower.  No action taken by legal
counsel chosen by an Indemnified Party in investigating or defending against any
such Indemnity Proceeding shall vitiate or in any way impair the obligations and
duties of the  Borrower  hereunder  to  indemnify  and hold  harmless  each such
Indemnified Party;  provided,  however,  that (i) if the Borrower is required to
indemnify  an  Indemnified  Party  pursuant  hereto  and (ii) the  Borrower  has
provided  evidence  reasonably  satisfactory to such Indemnified  Party that the
Borrower has the financial  wherewithal to reimburse such Indemnified  Party for
any  amount  paid by such  Indemnified  Party  with  respect  to such  Indemnity
Proceeding,  such  Indemnified  Party  shall not settle or  compromise  any such
Indemnity  Proceeding  without the prior written  consent of the Borrower (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).
                                      104
<PAGE>
     If and to the extent that the  obligations  of the Borrower  hereunder  are
unenforceable  for any reason,  the Borrower  hereby  agrees to make the maximum
contribution  to the  payment  and  satisfaction  of such  obligations  which is
permissible under Applicable Law.

     Termination; Survival.

     At such time as (a) all of the Commitments have been  terminated,  (b) none
of the Lenders is obligated  any longer  under this  Agreement to make any Loans
and (c) all Obligations (other than obligations which survive as provided in the
following  sentence) have been paid and satisfied in full,  this Agreement shall
terminate. The indemnities to which the Administrative Agent and the Lenders are
entitled under the provisions of Sections 3.12,  5.1, 5.4, 12.7,  13.2 and 13.10
and any other provision of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents,  and the
provisions  of Section 13.5,  shall  continue in full force and effect and shall
protect  the  Administrative  Agent  and the  Lenders  (i)  notwithstanding  any
termination of this Agreement,  or of the other Loan  Documents,  against events
arising after such termination as well as before and (ii) at all times after any
such party  ceases to be a party to this  Agreement  with respect to all matters
and events  existing on or prior to the date such party  ceased to be a party to
this Agreement.

     Severability of Provisions.

     Any provision of this Agreement which is prohibited or unenforceable in any
jurisdiction  shall, as to such jurisdiction,  be ineffective only to the extent
of such prohibition or  unenforceability  without  invalidating the remainder of
such  provision  or the  remaining  provisions  or  affecting  the  validity  or
enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction.

     GOVERNING LAW.

     THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE  WITH, THE
LAWS OF THE STATE OF  CALIFORNIA  APPLICABLE  TO CONTRACTS  EXECUTED,  AND TO BE
FULLY PERFORMED, IN SUCH STATE.

     Counterparts.

     This Agreement and any amendments,  waivers, consents or supplements may be
executed  in any  number of  counterparts  and by  different  parties  hereto in
separate  counterparts,  each of which when so executed and  delivered  shall be
deemed an original,  but all of which counterparts together shall constitute but
one and the same instrument.

     Obligations with Respect to Loan Parties.

     The obligations of the Borrower to direct or prohibit the taking of certain
actions by the other Loan Parties as specified  herein shall be absolute and not
subject to any defense the Borrower may have that the Borrower  does not control
such Loan Parties.

                                      105
<PAGE>
     Independence of Covenants.

     All  covenants  hereunder  shall be given in any  jurisdiction  independent
effect so that if a particular  action or  condition is not  permitted by any of
such  covenants,  the fact that it would be permitted by an exception  to, or be
otherwise  within  the  limitations  of,  another  covenant  shall not avoid the
occurrence  of a  Default  or an Event of  Default  if such  action  is taken or
condition exists.

     Limitation of Liability.

     Neither  the  Administrative  Agent  nor any  Lender,  nor  any  affiliate,
officer, director,  employee,  attorney, or agent of the Administrative Agent or
any Lender shall have any  liability  with  respect to, and the Borrower  hereby
waives,  releases,  and agrees  not to sue any of them  upon,  any claim for any
special, indirect,  incidental, or consequential damages suffered or incurred by
the Borrower in connection with,  arising out of, or in any way related to, this
Agreement  or  any of  the  other  Loan  Documents,  or any of the  transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents.  The Borrower
hereby waives,  releases,  and agrees not to sue the Administrative Agent or any
Lender  or  any of  the  Administrative  Agent's  or  any  Lender's  affiliates,
officers,  directors,  employees,  attorneys,  or agents for punitive damages in
respect of any claim in connection  with,  arising out of, or in any way related
to,  this  Agreement  or  any  of  the  other  Loan  Documents,  or  any  of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or financed hereby.

     Entire Agreement.

     This Agreement,  the Notes, and the other Loan Documents referred to herein
embody the final,  entire  agreement  among the parties hereto and supersede any
