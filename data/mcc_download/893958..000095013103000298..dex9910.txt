         (i)   In addition to the duties of the Administrator set forth above,
the Administrator shall perform all the duties of the Issuer under the Basic
Documents, including, without limitation, making all calculations and shall
prepare for execution by the Issuer or the Owner Trustee or shall cause the
preparation by other appropriate Persons of all such documents, reports,
filings, instruments, certificates, notices and opinions as it shall be the duty
of the Issuer or the Owner Trustee to prepare, file or deliver pursuant to the
Basic Documents, and at the request of the Owner Trustee shall take all
appropriate action that it is the duty of the Issuer or the Owner Trustee to
take pursuant to the Basic Documents. Subject to Section 7 of this Agreement,
and in accordance with the directions of the Owner Trustee, the Administrator
shall administer, perform or supervise the performance of such other activities
in connection with the Collateral (including the Basic Documents) as are not
covered by any of the foregoing provisions and as are expressly requested by the
Owner Trustee and are reasonably within the capability of the Administrator.

         (ii)  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or the Basic Documents
to the contrary, the Administrator shall be responsible for promptly notifying
the Owner Trustee if any withholding tax is imposed on the Trust's payments to a
Certificateholder as contemplated in Section 5.2(c) of the Trust Agreement. Any
such notice shall specify the amount of any withholding tax required to be
withheld by the Owner Trustee pursuant to such provision.

         (iii) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or the Basic Documents
to the contrary, the Administrator shall be responsible for performance of the
duties of the Owner Trustee set forth in Section 5.4 of the Trust Agreement with
respect to, among other things, accounting and reports to Certificateholders;
provided, however, that if the Owner Trustee is notified by the Administrator
that the Issuer is deemed to be taxable as a partnership for federal income tax
purposes, the Owner Trustee shall retain responsibility for the distribution to
the Certificateholders of the Schedule K-1s necessary to enable each
Certificateholder to prepare its federal and state income tax returns.

         (iv)  The Administrator may satisfy any obligations it may have with

acceptable to the Owner Trustee which shall perform the obligations of the
Administrator thereunder.

         (v)   The Administrator shall perform the duties of the Administrator
specified in Section 6.10 of the Trust Agreement required to be performed in

Agreement.

         (vi)  In carrying out the foregoing duties or any of its other
obligations under this Agreement, the Administrator may enter into transactions
with or otherwise deal with any of its Affiliates; provided, however, that the
terms of any such transactions or dealings shall be in accordance with any
directions received from the Issuer and shall be, in the Administrator's
opinion, no less favorable to the Issuer than would be available from Persons
that are not Affiliates of the Administrator.

         (vii) The Administrator shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the
Indenture Trustee and the Owner Trustee from and against any and all costs,
expenses, losses, claims, damages,

                                        6

<PAGE>

and liabilities to the extent that such cost, expense, loss, claim, damage, or
liability arose out of, or was imposed upon the Indenture Trustee or the Owner
Trustee through the negligence, willful misfeasance or bad faith of the
Administrator in the performance of its duties under this Agreement or by reason
of reckless disregard of its obligations and duties under this Agreement.
Indemnification under this Section 2(b)(vii) shall include, without limitation,
reasonable fees and expenses of counsel and expenses of litigation. If the
Administrator has made any indemnity payments pursuant to this Section 2(b)(vii)
and the recipient thereafter collects any of such amounts from others, the
recipient shall promptly repay such amounts collected to the Administrator,
without interest.

     (c) Non-Ministerial Matters.

         (i)   With respect to matters that in the reasonable judgment of the
Administrator are non-ministerial, the Administrator shall not take any action
unless, within a reasonable time before the taking of such action, the
Administrator shall have notified the Owner Trustee of the proposed action and
the Owner Trustee shall not have withheld consent or provided an alternative
direction. For the purpose of the preceding sentence, "non-ministerial matters"
shall include, without limitation:

               (A) the amendment of or any supplement to the Indenture;

as promptly as possible after the giving of notice of termination to the
Servicer of the Servicer's rights and powers pursuant to Section 7.02 of the
Trust Sale and Servicing Agreement, to enforce the provisions of Sections 7.02,
7.03 and 7.04 of the Trust Sale and Servicing Agreement with respect to the
appointment of a successor Servicer. Such successor Servicer shall, upon
compliance with Sections 10(e)(ii) and (iii), become the successor Administrator
hereunder.

         4.    Records. The Administrator shall comply with Section 5.4 of the

Administrator shall furnish to the Issuer from time to time such additional
information regarding the Collateral as the Issuer shall reasonably request.

the manner in which it accomplishes the performance of its obligations
hereunder. Unless expressly authorized by the Issuer, the Administrator shall
have no authority to act for or represent the Issuer or the Owner Trustee in any
way and shall not otherwise be deemed an agent of the Issuer or the Owner
Trustee.

         8.    No Joint Venture. Nothing contained in this Agreement (i) shall
constitute the Administrator and either of the Issuer or the Owner Trustee as
members of any partnership, joint venture, association, syndicate,
unincorporated business or other separate entity, (ii) shall be construed to
impose any liability as such on any of them or (iii) shall be deemed to confer
on any of them any express, implied or apparent authority to incur any
obligation or liability on behalf of the others.

         9.    Other Activities of Administrator. Nothing herein shall prevent
the Administrator or its Affiliates from engaging in other businesses or, in its
sole discretion, from acting in a similar capacity as an administrator for any
other person or entity even though such person or entity may engage in business
activities similar to those of the Issuer, the Owner Trustee or the Indenture
Trustee.

                                        9

<PAGE>

         (ii)  to cure any ambiguity or to correct or supplement any provision
herein which may be inconsistent with any other provision herein;

         (iii) to evidence and provide for the appointment of a successor
Administrator hereunder and to add to or change any of the provisions of this
Agreement as shall be necessary to facilitate such succession; and

         (iv)  to add any provisions to or change in any manner or eliminate any
of the provisions of this Agreement or to modify in any manner the rights of the
Noteholders or Certificateholders; provided, however, that such amendment under
this Section 13(a)(iv) shall not, as evidenced by an Opinion of Counsel,
materially and adversely affect in any material respect the interest of any
Noteholder or Certificateholder.

     (b) This Agreement may also be amended by the Issuer, the Administrator and
the Indenture Trustee with prior notice to the Rating Agencies and with the
written consent of the Owner Trustee and the holders of Notes evidencing at
least a majority in the Outstanding Amount of the Notes as of the close of the
immediately preceding Distribution Date and the holders of Certificates
evidencing at least a majority of the Voting Interests as of the close of the
preceding Distribution Date for the purpose of adding any provisions to,
changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of this Agreement or
of modifying in any manner the rights of Noteholders or the Certificateholders;
provided, however, that no such amendment may (i) increase or reduce in any
manner the amount of, or accelerate or delay the timing of, collections of
payments on Receivables or distributions that are required to be made for the
benefit of the Noteholders or Certificateholders, (ii) reduce the percentage of
the holders of Notes and Certificates which are required to consent to any
amendment of this Agreement or (iii) modify or alter any provision of this
Section 13, except to provide that certain additional provisions of this
Agreement and the Basic Documents cannot be modified or waived without the
consent of each Noteholder and Certificateholder affected thereby, without, in
any such case, the consent of the holders of all the outstanding Notes and
Certificates.

     (c) Notwithstanding Sections 13(a) and (b), the Administrator may not amend
this Agreement without the permission of the Seller, which permission shall not
be unreasonably withheld.

         14.   Successors and Assigns. This Agreement may not be assigned by the
Administrator unless such assignment is previously consented to in writing by
the Issuer and the Owner Trustee and subject to the satisfaction of the Rating
Agency Condition in respect thereof. An assignment with such consent and
satisfaction, if accepted by the assignee, shall bind the assignee hereunder in
the same manner as the Administrator is bound hereunder. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, this Agreement may be assigned by the Administrator without the
consent of the Issuer or the Owner Trustee to a corporation or other
organization that is a successor (by merger, consolidation or purchase of
assets) to the Administrator, provided that such successor organization executes
and delivers to the Issuer, the Owner Trustee and the Indenture Trustee an
agreement in which such corporation or other organization agrees to be bound
hereunder by the terms of such assignment in the same manner as the
Administrator is bound hereunder. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement shall
bind any successors or assigns of the parties hereto.

IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INTERNAL LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, WITHOUT REGARD TO

parties in separate counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered
shall be an original, but all such counterparts shall together constitute but
one and the same instrument.

         18.   Severability of Provisions. If any one or more of the covenants,
agreements, provisions or terms of this Agreement shall for any reason
whatsoever be held invalid, then such covenants, agreements, provisions or terms
shall be deemed severable from the remaining covenants, agreements, provisions
or terms of this Agreement and shall in no way affect the validity or
enforceability of the other provisions of this Agreement or of the Certificates
or the rights of the holders thereof.

of the Issuer.
