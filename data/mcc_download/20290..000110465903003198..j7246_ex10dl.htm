<h1 style="font-weight:normal;margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">is
arbitrable, will be settled by arbitration. This agreement to arbitrate
includes but is not limited to all claims for any form of illegal
discrimination, improper or unfair treatment or dismissal, and all tort claims.
The Executive will still have a right to file a discrimination charge with a
federal or state agency, but the final resolution of any discrimination claim
will be submitted to arbitration instead of a court or jury. The arbitration
proceeding will be conducted under the employment dispute resolution
arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association in effect at the time
a demand for arbitration under the rules is made, and such proceeding will be
adjudicated in the state of Ohio in accordance with the laws of the state of
Ohio. The decision of the arbitrator(s), including determination of the amount
of any damages suffered, will be exclusive, final, and binding on all parties,
their heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns. Each party will
bear its own expenses in the arbitration for arbitrators&#146; fees and attorneys&#146;
fees, for its witnesses, and for other expenses of presenting its case. Other
arbitration costs, including administrative fees and fees for records or
transcripts, will be borne equally by the parties. Notwithstanding anything in
this Section to the contrary, if the Executive prevails with respect to any
dispute submitted to arbitration under this Section, Cinergy will reimburse or
pay all legal fees and expenses that the Executive may reasonably incur as a
result of the dispute.</font></h1>
