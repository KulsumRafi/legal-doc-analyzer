<p align="center"><font size="2">3</font></p>

<hr>

<p><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if Company maintains a
long-term disability policy in effect for the benefit of Employee, on the date
when the
Employee shall have received total disability benefits under said policy for a
period of six (6) months;</font></p>

<p><font size="2">&nbsp;(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if no such long-term disability
insurance policy is in effect, on the date when the Employee suffers from a
physical or mental disability of such magnitude and effect that the Employee is
unable to perform the essential
functions of Employee's assigned position with or without reasonable
accommodation and such disability
continues during a period of twelve (12) continuous or non-continuous months

disabled.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Total Disability as set forth in subsections (ii) or (iii)
above shall be deemed to have occurred upon the written certification to
Company thereof by the Employee's personal physician, which certification may
be requested in writing by Company. If the Employee does not have a personal
physician or refuses to consult with his personal physician, Company may select
a licensed Vermont physician, board-certified in internal medicine or family
practice, at Employee's cost, to examine the Employee, which physician shall,
for purposes hereof, be deemed to be the Employee's personal physician;
provided, that if the Employee refuses to be examined by this deemed personal
physician within thirty (30) days after the physician's appointment by Company,
then the Employee may at Company's election be conclusively presumed to have
become Totally Disabled as of the close of such thirty (30) day period. If Company disagrees with the opinion of the
Employee's personal physician, then Company may select a second licensed,
board-certified Vermont physician, at Company's cost, to examine the Employee.
If said two (2) physicians disagree as to whether Employee is Totally Disabled,
then the personal physician and this second physician shall then select a third
licensed, board-certified Vermont physician, with the cost of this third
physician to be split between Employee and Company, to examine the
Employee. Upon examination of the
Employee by the three (3) physicians, each physician shall render an opinion
with respect to the condition of the Employee in regards to his Total
Disability, and the opinion of a majority of the physicians shall be binding
upon all parties.</font></p>

Without Cause</u>.&nbsp; Company shall have
the right to terminate this agreement and Employee's employment under this
agreement without cause, provided, however that in the event of such
termination Company shall continue to pay the Employee's Annual Base Salary in

termination, or for the remainder of the Term, whichever is shorter (the &quot;Severance Period&quot;) as severance payments.
Except for the severance payments provided in this subsection and the

Directors reasonably determines will have or has had an adverse affect on the

affairs of Company or the ROAC Corporate Group, (any such termination is herein sometimes referred to as a
&quot;Termination With Cause&quot; or as &quot;Terminated With Cause&quot;). In the event that Employee's employment is
Terminated With Cause or Employee resigns in lieu of such termination, Employee
shall only be entitled to be paid any expenses he has incurred prior to the

<p><font size="2">9.&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Return of Property</u>.&nbsp; Upon termination or nonrenewal of this
agreement for any reason, Employee agrees to immediately return all Company and
ROAC Corporate Group property, whether confidential or not, without keeping any
copies or excerpts thereof, including, but not limited to, computers, printers,
customer lists, samples, product information, financial information, price

Restricted Business in the Restricted Territory. Accordingly, as a material and essential inducement to Company to

(1) if this agreement is terminated by the Company without cause,
Employee will not, in the Restricted Territory, directly or indirectly, in any
manner whatsoever during the Severance Period; <u>or</u> (2) if this agreement

interest owned by Employee during the Term of this agreement, and after

herein and in Section 10 are considered by the parties hereto to be reasonable
in all circumstances, it is recognized that any one or more of such restrictions
might fail for unforeseen reasons.&nbsp; Accordingly, it is hereby agreed and
declared that if any of such restrictions shall be adjudged to be void as
unreasonable in all circumstances for the protection of Company and the ROAC
Corporate Group and their interests, but would be valid if part of the wording
thereof were deleted, the period thereof reduced, or the range of activities or
area dealt with reduced in scope, such restrictions shall apply with the minimum
modification as may be necessary to make them valid and effective, while still
affording to Company and the ROAC Corporate Group the maximum amount of
protection contemplated thereby.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2">7</font></p>

<hr>

<p><font size="2">Employee represents that he has
carefully reviewed Employee's restrictive non-competition covenant set forth in
this Section 10 and non-solicitation covenant in Section 8 and has determined
that these covenants will not impose undue hardship, financial or otherwise, on
Employee; that their Restrictive Territory and duration will not impose a
hardship on Employee; that they protect Company's and the ROAC Corporate Group's
legitimate interests in their investment in Employee and their Restricted
Business; and that in Employee's opinion Employee not being able to compete in
the Restrictive Territory for the duration of this covenant will not be
injurious to the public interest.</font></p>

this Sections 7, 8, 9 and 10 will cause irreparable harm to Company and the ROAC
Corporate Group.</font></p>

with the prior written consent of Company.
Employee agrees that he will not, while this agreement is in effect, do
any unlawful acts or engage in any unlawful habits or usages which injure,
directly or indirectly, Company and its Business or the ROAC Corporate Group
and its businesses. Company agrees that
if it exercises its rights in Section 2(a) hereof to have Employee perform no
duties for it, then during such period of time during the Term as Employee is
so not performing his duties, Employee may engage in other employment which
does not violate the non-competition covenant in Section 10 and his other
covenants in Sections 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 of this agreement.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Governing Law, Jurisdiction and
Venue</u>.&nbsp; This agreement shall be
governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Vermont;

agreement, and such remaining provisions shall continue in full force and effect.</font></p>
