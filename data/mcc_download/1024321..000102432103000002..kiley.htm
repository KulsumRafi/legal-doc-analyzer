<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.1     <u>Termination for Cause (12 C.F.R. 563.39).</u></font></p>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Termination for Cause shall mean termination because of Employee's personal dishonesty, incompetence,
willful misconduct, any
breach of fiduciary duty involving personal profit, intentional failure to
perform stated duties, willful violation of any law, rule or regulation (other
than traffic violations or similar offenses) or final cease-and-desist order or
material breach of any provision of this Agreement. For purposes of this
Agreement, no act, or the failure to act, on Employee&#146;s part shall be
willful&#148; unless done, or omitted to be done, not in good faith and without
reasonable belief that the action or omission was in the best interest of the
Bank. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Employee shall not be deemed to have been
terminated for Cause unless and until there shall have been delivered to him a
notice of termination which shall include a copy of a resolution duly adopted by
the affirmative vote of not less than a majority of the members of the Board at
a meeting of the Board called and held for that purpose (which may be
telephonic), finding that in the good faith opinion of the Board, Employee was
guilty of conduct justifying termination for Cause and specifying the
particulars thereof in detail. Employee shall not have the right to receive
compensation or other benefits for any period after termination for Cause which
have not vested or been earned as of the date of such termination. Employee
shall have the right to receive compensation or other benefits which have
already vested or been earned as of the date of termination for Cause, unless
payment of such compensation or benefits is expressly prohibited by the terms of
any plan, program or agreement governing such compensation or benefits. The
Employee shall have no right to receive compensation or other benefits for any
period after termination for Cause. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding the foregoing:</font></p>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)      The Board of Directors of the Bank may terminate the Employee's employment at any time without
cause, but any termination by the Bank's Board of Directors other than termination for Cause shall not prejudice the Employee's right
to compensation or other benefits under this Agreement.</font></p>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)      If the Employee is suspended and/or temporarily prohibited from participating in the conduct of
the Bank's affairs by a notice served under section 8(e)(3) or (g) (1) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1818(e)(3) and
(g)(1)), the Bank's obligations under this Agreement shall be suspended as of the date of service, unless stayed by appropriate
proceedings.  If the charges in the notice are dismissed, the Bank may in its discretion (i) pay the Employee all or part of the
compensation withheld while its contract obligations were suspended, or (ii) reinstate (in whole or in part) any of its obligations
which were suspended.</font></p>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)      If the Employee is removed and/or is permanently prohibited from participating in the conduct of
the Bank's affairs by an order issued under section 8(e)(4) or (g)(1) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1818(e)(3) and
(g)(1)), all obligations of the Bank under this Agreement shall terminate as of the effective date of the order, but vested rights of
the Employee shall not be affected.</font></p>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)      If the Bank is in default (as defined in section (3)(x)(1) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act),
all obligations under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date of default, but this paragraph (d) shall not affect any vested
rights of the Employee.</font></p>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)      All obligations under this Agreement shall be terminated, except to the extent it is determined
that continuation of this Agreement is necessary for the continued operation of the association:</font></p>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)     By the Director ("Director of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation") or his or her
designee, at the time the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation  enters into an agreement to provide assistance to or on behalf of
the Bank under the authority contained in section 13(c) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act; or</font></p>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)     By the Director or his or her designee, when the Director or his or her designee approves
a supervisory merger to resolve problems related to the operation of the association, or when the Bank is determined by the Director
to be in an unsafe or unsound condition; <u>provided that</u> any rights of the parties that have already vested shall not be affected by
such action.</font></p>



<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.2     <u>Termination Upon An Other Event of Termination</u></font></p>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)      Upon the occurrence of an Other Event of Termination (as herein defined) during the Term, the
provisions of this Section 4.3 shall apply.  As used in this Agreement, an Other Event of Termination" shall mean and include any one

re-elect or to appoint or re-appoint Employee as President and Chief Executive Officer unless consented to by the Employee, (B) a
material change in Employee's functions, duties, or responsibilities, which change would cause Employee's position to become one of
lesser responsibility, importance, or scope from the position and attributes thereof described in Sections 1.1 and 2.1 hereof, unless
consented to by Employee, (C) a relocation of Employee's principal place of employment outside of Los Angeles County or Ventura

reduction in the amount of Employee's bonus based on the application of a formula or index to the financial performance of the Bank,
(E) a liquidation or dissolution of the Bank, or (F) a material breach of this Agreement by the Bank or the Company.  Upon the
occurrence of any event described in clauses (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) or (F), above, Employee shall have the right to elect to
terminate his employment under this Agreement by resignation upon not less than thirty (30) days prior written notice given within
six full months after the event giving rise to said right to elect.</font></p>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)      Upon the occurrence of an Other Event of Termination, the Bank shall be obligated to pay Employee,
or, in the event of his subsequent death, his beneficiary or beneficiaries, or his estate, as the case may be, an amount equal to
Employee's then annual base salary.  Such amount shall be paid in six equal monthly installments commencing on the 30th day after the
Termination Date.  Such amount shall be in addition to any compensation or benefits earned by Employee or to which Employee was
entitled prior to the Termination Date.  Such payments shall not be reduced in the event the Employee obtains other employment
following termination of employment.</font></p>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)      Upon the occurrence of an Other Event of Termination, the Bank will cause to be continued life,
medical, dental and disability coverage substantially identical to the coverage maintained by the Bank or the Company for Employee
prior to his termination at no premium cost to the Employee, except to the extent such coverage may be changed in its application to
all executive-level employees of the Bank if such coverage was generally available on the date of an Other Event of Termination to
executive-level employees of the Bank, if such coverage was generally available on the date of an Other Event of Termination to
executive-level employees of the Bank, or except to the extent such coverage may be changed in its application to all executive-level
employees of the Company if such coverage was generally available on the date of an other Event of Termination to executive level
employees of the Company.  The benefits provided under this Section 4.2(c) shall continue until the earlier of (a) the expiration of
one year following Employee's termination of employment with the Bank, or (b) the date Employee becomes covered under any other group
health plan not maintained by the Bank, the Company or any of its subsidiaries; provided, however, that if such other group health
plan excludes any pre-existing condition that Employee or Employee's dependents may have when coverage under such group health plan
would otherwise begin, coverage under this Section 4.2(c) shall continue (but not beyond the one year period described in clause (a)
of this sentence) with respect to such pre-existing condition until such exclusion under such other group health plan lapses or
expires.  In the event Employee is required to make an election under Sections 601 through 607 of the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974 (commonly known as COBRA) to qualify for the benefits described in this Section 4.2(c), the obligations of the
Bank under this Section 4.2(c) shall be conditioned upon Employee's timely making such an election.</font></p>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.3      <u>Change of Control.</u></font></p>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)      For purposes of this Agreement, a Change of Control" of the Bank or Company shall mean:  (i) any
"person" (as the term is used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)), or
more than one person acting as a group, becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act), directly or
indirectly, of voting securities of the Bank, the Company or any subsidiary of the Company which owns a majority of the outstanding
voting securities of the Bank (the Direct Parent") representing 50% or more of the Bank's, the Company's or the Direct Parent's
outstanding voting securities, except for any voting securities (A) of the Bank purchased by the Company or Direct Parent, (B) of the
Direct Parent purchased by the Company, or (C) of the Bank or Company purchased by any employee benefit plan of the Bank or the
Company, or (ii) individuals who constitute the board of directors of the Bank (including Employee, if Employee is a director) on the
date hereof (the "Incumbent Board") cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority thereof, provided that any person becoming
a director subsequent to the date hereof whose election was approved by a vote of more than one-half of the directors comprising the
Incumbent Board, or whose nomination for election by the company's stockholders was approved by the same nominating committee serving
under an Incumbent Board, shall be, for purposes of this clause (ii), considered as though he were a member of the Incumbent Board,
or (iii) the consummation of (A) a merger, consolidation or reorganization to which the Bank, the Company or the Direct Parent is a
party, whether or not the Bank, the Company or the Direct Parent is the entity surviving or resulting therefrom, or (B) a sale or
other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Bank, the Company or the Direct Parent, in one transaction or a
series of related transactions, to any person other than the Bank, the Company or the Direct Parent; provided, however, that no such
consummation will constitute a Change of Control pursuant to this clause (iii) if persons who were stockholders of the Company
immediately before the consummation of the transaction are the beneficial owners immediately following the consummation of the
transaction, of more than 50% of  the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities of the person surviving or
resulting from any merger, consolidation or reorganization referred to in clause (iii)(A) or the person to whom the assets of the
Bank, the Company or the Direct Parent are sold, assigned or disposed of in any transaction or series of transactions referred to in
clause (iii)(B).</font></p>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)      If a Change of Control has occurred pursuant to Section 4.3(a) or the Board has determined that a
Change of Control has occurred, Employee shall be entitled to the benefits provided in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this Section 4.3
upon his subsequent termination of employment at any time within 12 months following the Change of Control due to:  (i) Employee's
dismissal without cause or (ii) Employee's voluntary resignation following an Other Event of Termination (as defined in Section 4.2).</font></p>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)      Upon Employee's entitlement to benefits pursuant to Section 4.3(b), the Bank shall pay Employee,
or in the event of his subsequent death, his beneficiary or beneficiaries, or his estate, as the case may be, a sum equal to two
times the then annual base salary.  Such payment shall be made in one lump sum within 30 days after Employee's termination of
employment which entitles Employee thereto; provided, however, that in the event the Bank is not in compliance with its minimum
capital requirements or if such payment would cause the Bank's capital to be reduced below its minimum regulatory capital
requirements, such payment shall be deferred until such time as the Bank or successor thereto is in capital compliance.  In the event
the Bank is unable to make such payment after deferred for more than (6) months, payment of said sum shall be made by the Company.
Such payment shall not be reduced in the event Executive obtains other employment following termination of employment.</font></p>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)      Upon Employee's entitlement to benefits pursuant to Section 4.3, the Bank will cause to be
continued life, medical, dental and disability coverage substantially identical to the coverage maintained by the Bank for Employee
prior to his termination of employment at no premium cost to the Employee, except to the extent such coverage may be changed in its
application to all executive level employees of the Bank if such coverage was generally available on Executive's Termination Date to
executive-level employees of the Bank, or except to the extent such coverage may be changed in its application to all executive-level
employees of the Company if such coverage was generally available on Executive's Termination Date to executive-level employees of the
Company.  The benefits provided under this Section 4.3(d) shall continue until the earlier of (a) the expiration of one year
following Employee's termination of employment with the Bank, or (b) the date Employee becomes covered under any other group health
plan not maintained by the Bank, the Company or any of its subsidiaries; provided, however, that if such other group health plan
excludes any pre-existing condition that Employee or Employee's dependents may have when coverage under such group health plan would
otherwise begin, coverage under this Section 4.3(d) shall continue (but not beyond the one year period described in clause (a) of
this sentence) with respect to such pre-existing condition until such exclusion under such other group health plan lapses or
expires.  In the event Employee is required to make an election under Sections 601 through 607 of the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974 (commonly known as COBRA) to qualify for the benefits described in this Section 4.3(d), the obligations of the
Bank under this Section 4.3(d) shall be conditioned upon Employee's timely making such an election.</font></p>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 4.3, in no event shall the aggregate
payments or benefits to be made or afforded to Employee under Section 4.3 (the Termination Benefits") constitute an "excess parachute
payment" under Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended or any successor thereto, and in order to avoid such a
result, Termination Benefits will be reduced, if necessary, to an amount (the Non-Triggering Amount"), the value of which is $1.00
less than an amount equal to three times Employee's base amount," as determined in accordance with said Section 280G.  The allocation
of the reduction required hereby among the Termination Benefits provided by this Section 4.3 shall be determined by Employee.</font></p>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.4 <U>Termination By the
Employee or Death</U>. If the Employee terminates his employment with the Bank
for any reason other than the reasons set forth in Sections 4.2 and 4.3 hereof,
or Employee&#146;s employment is terminated as a result of his death, the Bank
shall pay to the Employee, or in the event of his death, his beneficiary or
beneficiaries or his estate, as the case may be, the base salary earned but

Date to Employee the base salary earned but unpaid pursuant to Section 3.1
hereof through the Termination Date and any earned but unused vacation pay due
to the Employee at the Termination Date. In addition, the Employee shall be
entitled to receive benefits based on the Bank&#146;s applicable disability
plans then in effect. Employee shall not have the right to receive compensation
or other benefits for any period after the Termination Date which have not

other remedy of the Bank, the Bank&#146;s obligation, if any, to make severance
payments under Section 4.3 shall cease as of the date such breach occurs.
Moreover, the Employee acknowledges that breach of Article 2, 5 or 6 of this

policy, if any, then in existence. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.1 <U>Bank&#146;s
Ownership</U>. The Employee agrees that all inventions, discoveries,
improvements, trade secrets, formulas, techniques, mask works, processes, and
know-how, whether or not patentable, and whether or not reduced to practice,
that are conceived or developed during the Employee&#146;s employment with the
Bank, either alone or jointly with others, or relating to the Bank or to the
banking industry shall be owned exclusively by the Bank, and the Employee hereby
assigns to the Bank all Employee&#146;s right, title, and interest in all such
intellectual property. The Employee agrees that the Bank shall be the sole owner
of all rights pertaining thereto, including but not limited to domestic and
foreign patents or other rights pertaining thereto, and further agrees to
execute all documents that the Bank reasonably determines to be necessary or
convenient for use in applying for, prosecuting, perfecting, or enforcing
patents or other intellectual property rights, including the execution of any
assignments, patents applications, or other documents that Bank may reasonably
request. The Employee shall claim no interest in any inventions, copyrighted

applicable law. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.2 <U>Statutory Limitation
on Assignment</U>. The Employee understands that the Bank is hereby advising the
Employee that any provision in this Agreement requiring the Employee to assign
rights in any invention does not apply to an invention that qualifies fully
under the provisions of Section 2870 of the California Labor Code. That Section
provides, as follows: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)      Any provision in an employment agreement which provides that an employee shall assign, or offer to
assign, any of his or her rights in invention to his or her employer shall not apply to an invention that the employee developed
entirely on his or her own time without using the employer's equipment, supplies facilities, or trade secret information, except for
those inventions that either:</font></p>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)     Relate at the time of conception or reduction to practice of the invention to the

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)      To the extent a provision in an employment agreement purports to require an employee to assign an
invention otherwise excluded from being required to be assigned under subdivision (a), the provision is against the public policy of
the state and is unenforceable.</font></p>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By
signing this Agreement, the Employee acknowledges that this paragraph shall
constitute written notice of the provisions of Section 2870. </FONT></P>

therein or to any commission, finder&#146;s fee, or other compensation in
connection therewith other than the salary to be paid to the Employee as

Bank, the Employee shall deliver to the Bank all Bank property and materials
that are in the Employee&#146;s possession or control, including all of the

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any claim or controversy
between the parties which the parties are unable to resolve themselves,
including any claim arising out of Employee&#146;s employment or the termination
of that employment, and including any claim arising out of, connected with, or
related to the formation, interpretation, performance or breach of this
Agreement, and any claim or dispute as to whether a claim is subject to
arbitration, shall be submitted to and resolved exclusively by expedited
arbitration by a single arbitrator in accordance with the following procedures: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.1 In the event of a claim
or controversy subject to this arbitration provision, the complaining party
shall promptly send written notice to the other party identifying the matter in
dispute and the proposed remedy. Following the giving of such notice, the
parties shall meet and attempt in good faith to resolve the matter. In the event
the parties are unable to resolve the matter within 21 days, the parties shall
meet and attempt in good faith to select a single arbitrator acceptable to both
parties. If a single arbitrator is not selected by mutual consent within 10
business days following the giving of the written notice of dispute, an
arbitrator shall be selected from a list of nine persons, each of whom shall be
an attorney who is either engaged in the active practice of law or a recognized
arbitrator and who, in either event, is experienced in serving as an arbitrator
in disputes between employers and employees, which list shall be provided by the
main Los Angeles office of the American Arbitration Association (AAA) or of the
Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service. If, within three business days of
the parties&#146; receipt of such list, the parties are unable to agree upon an
arbitrator from the list, then the parties shall each strike names alternatively
from the list, with the first to strike being determined by the flip of a coin.
After each party has had four strikes, the remaining name on the list shall be
the arbitrator. If such person is unable to serve for any reason, the parties
shall repeat this process until an arbitrator is selected. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.2 Unless the parties
agree otherwise, within 120 days of the selection of the arbitrator, a hearing
shall be conducted before such arbitrator at a time and a place in Los Angeles
County agreed upon by the parties. In the event the parties are unable to agree
upon the time or place of the arbitration, the time and place within Los Angeles
County shall be designated by the arbitrator after consultation with the
parties. Within 30 days of the conclusion of the arbitration hearing, the
arbitrator shall issue an award, accompanied by a written decision explaining
the basis for the arbitrator&#146;s award. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.3 In any arbitration
hereunder, the Bank shall pay all administrative fees of the arbitration and all
fees of the arbitrator, except that Employee may, if he wishes, pay up to
one-half of those amounts. Each party shall pay its own attorneys&#146; fees,
costs, and expenses, unless the arbitrator orders otherwise. The prevailing
party in such arbitration, as determined by the arbitrator, and in any
enforcement or other court proceedings, shall be entitled, to the extent
permitted by law, to reimbursement from the other party for all of the
prevailing party&#146;s costs (including, but not limited to, the
arbitrator&#146;s compensation), expenses, and attorneys&#146; fees. The
arbitrator shall have no authority to add to or to modify this Agreement, shall
apply all applicable law, and shall have no lesser and no greater remedial
authority than would a court of law resolving the same claim or controversy. The
arbitrator shall, upon an appropriate motion, dismiss any claim without an
evidentiary hearing if the party bringing the motion establishes that it would
be entitled to summary judgment if the matter had been pursued in court
litigation. The parties shall be entitled to reasonable discovery subject to the
discretion of the arbitrator. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.4.     The decision of the arbitrator shall be final, binding, and non-appealable, except as otherwise permitted
by law, and may be enforced as a final judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.</font></p>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.5 This agreement to
resolve any disputes by arbitration shall extend to claims against any parent,
subsidiary, or affiliate of each party, and, when acting within such capacity,
any officer, director, shareholder, employee or agent of each party, or of any
of the above, and shall apply as well to claims arising out of state and federal
statutes and local ordinances as well as to claims arising under the common law
or under this agreement. This agreement, however, shall not apply to claims for
workers&#146; compensation or unemployment compensation benefits. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.6 Notwithstanding the
foregoing, and unless otherwise agreed between the parties, either party may, in
an appropriate matter, apply to a court for provisional relief, including a
temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction, on the ground that the
arbitration award to which the applicant may be entitled may be rendered
ineffectual without provisional relief. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.7 Any arbitration
hereunder shall be conducted in accordance with the employment rules and
procedures of the AAA then in effect; provided, however, that, in the event of
any inconsistency between the rules and procedures of the AAA and the terms of
this Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall prevail. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.8 If any of the
provisions of this Section 7 are determined to be unlawful or otherwise
unenforceable, in whole or in part, such determination shall not affect the
validity of the remainder of this Section 7, and this Section 7 shall be
reformed to the extent necessary to carry out its provisions to the greatest
extent possible and to insure that the resolution of all conflicts between the
parties, including those arising out of statutory claims, shall be resolved by
neutral, binding arbitration. If a court should find that the provisions of this
Section 7 are not absolutely binding, then the parties intend any arbitration
decision and award to be fully admissible in evidence in any subsequent action,
given great weight by any finder of fact, and treated as determinative to the
maximum extent permitted by law. </FONT></P>
