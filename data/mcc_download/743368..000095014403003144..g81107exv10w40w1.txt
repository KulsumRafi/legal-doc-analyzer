                  The Bowater Canada Inc. ("BCI") Exchangeable Shares contain
         certain restrictions designed to assure the payment of dividends on the
         Exchangeable Shares. Among other things, unless all dividends on the
         Exchangeable Shares corresponding to dividends declared and paid to
         date on the Bowater Incorporated Common Shares have been declared and
         paid in full on the Exchangeable Shares, BCI shall not, without the
         prior approval of the holders of the Exchangeable Shares, pay any
         dividends on the BCI Common Shares or BCI Preferred Shares (or any
         other shares ranking junior to the Exchangeable Shares), or redeem or
         purchase or make any capital distribution in respect of such shares or
         any other shares of BCI ranking equally with the Exchangeable Shares
         with respect to the payment of dividends or any liquidation
         distribution.

                  The Support Agreement between Bowater Incorporated, Bowater
         Canadian Holdings Inc. ("BCHI") and BCI contains restrictions on the
         payment of dividends and other restrictions that are designed to ensure
         that the holders of the Bowater Canada Exchangeable Shares are treated
         the same as the holders of Bowater Common stock.

                  The provisions attached to the Preferred Shares of each of
         Bowater Canadian Forest Products Inc. ("BCFP"), BCI and BCHI contain
         restrictions on the payment of dividends in that no dividends may be
         paid on the respective common shares of those corporations (or other
         shares ranking junior to the Preferred Shares) unless all dividends are

         other distribution of property or assets by BCFP with respect to any
         shares of its capital stock, or any action taken by BCFP to make or
         repay the Guarantor or any other Subsidiary or to Guarantee
         Indebtedness of the Guarantor or any other Subsidiary, to ensure, in
         each case, that any such payment, distribution or action taken by BCFP
         does not (i) constitute a default under, or a breach or contravention
         of, any provision of such indentures, agreements, instruments or other
         arrangements, or (ii) result in a redemption, repurchase or similar
         right being granted to or in favor of the holders of the debt
         instruments issued pursuant to such indentures, agreements, instruments
         or other arrangements which, if exercised, would require BCFP to
         redeem, repurchase or otherwise acquire such debt instruments.
