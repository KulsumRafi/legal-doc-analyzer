<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THIS INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT (the </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>"Agreement"</I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>) dated as of
February&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, 2003, is made by and
between CIBER, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>"Corporation"</I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>), and the undersigned member of the Board of Directors, officer, employee or agent of the
Corporation (</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>"Indemnitee"</I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
the Corporation's Certificate of Incorporation (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>Certificate</I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") and Bylaws (the </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><B><I>"Bylaws"</I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>) and the Delaware General Corporation Law (the
</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>"DGCL"</I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>), under which the Corporation is
organized, empower the Corporation to indemnify its directors, officers, employees and agents by agreement and to indemnify persons who serve, at the request of the Corporation, as the directors,
officers, employees or agents of other corporations or enterprises, and expressly provide that the indemnification provided by the Certificate, the Bylaws and the DGCL are not exclusive; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
such Certificate, Bylaws and the DGCL contemplate that contracts, insurance policies and other financial arrangements may be entered into with respect to indemnification of
directors, officers, employees or agents; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
the Corporation has purchased and presently maintains a policy or policies of directors' and officers' liabilities insurance (</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>"D&amp;O
Insurance"</I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>) covering certain liabilities that may be incurred by the Corporation's directors and officers in the performance of their services to the Corporation; </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
the general availability of D&amp;O Insurance covering certain liabilities that may be incurred by the Corporation's directors and officers in the performance of their services to
the Corporation and the applicability, amendment and enforcement of statutory provisions and provisions of the Certificate and Bylaws present uncertainty concerning the adequacy and reliability of the
protection afforded directors and officers; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
it is reasonable, prudent and necessary for the Corporation to obligate itself contractually to indemnify Indemnitee so that Indemnitee will serve or continue to serve the
Corporation free from undue concern that Indemnitee will not be adequately protected; and </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
Indemnitee is willing to serve, continue to serve and to take on additional service for or on behalf of the Corporation on condition that Indemnitee be so indemnified. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW,
THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the covenants contained herein, the Corporation and Indemnitee do hereby covenant and agree as follows: </FONT></P>

Indemnitee's part while acting as a director, officer, employee or agent or by reason of the fact that Indemnitee is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee
or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, limited liability company or other enterprise; in each case whether or not Indemnitee is acting or serving in any such capacity at
the time any liability or expense is incurred for which indemnification or reimbursement can be provided under this Agreement; provided that any such action, suit or proceeding which is brought by
Indemnitee against the Corporation or directors, officers, employees or agents of the Corporation shall not be deemed a Proceeding, except (i) with respect to actions or proceedings to establish or
enforce a right to

or is or was serving at the request of such constituent corporation as a director, officer, employee, control person, agent or fiduciary of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, employee

competent jurisdiction to be unavailable to an Indemnitee in respect of any losses, claims, damages, expenses or liabilities referred to therein, then the Corporation, in lieu of indemnifying
Indemnitee thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by Indemnitee as a result of such losses, claims, damages, expenses or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to
reflect the relative benefits received by the Corporation and Indemnitee, or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is
appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Corporation and Indemnitee in connection with the action or inaction which
resulted in such losses, claims, damages, expenses or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. In connection with the registration of the Corporation's securities, the
relative benefits received by the Corporation and Indemnitee shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions that the net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by
the Corporation and the Indemnitee, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the applicable prospectus, bear to the aggregate public offering price of the securities so offered. The
relative fault of the Corporation and Indemnitee shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged
omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Corporation or Indemnitee and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or
prevent such statement or omission. </FONT></P>

Corporation and Indemnitee agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 2(c) were determined by pro rata or per capita allocation or by any
other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. In connection with the registration of the Corporation's
securities, in no event shall an Indemnitee be required to contribute any amount under this Section 2(c) in excess of the lesser of (i) that proportion of the total of such losses, claims, damages or
liabilities indemnified against equal to the proportion of the total securities sold under such registration statement which is being sold by Indemnitee or (ii) the proceeds received by Indemnitee
from its sale of securities under such registration statement. No person found guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 10(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to
contribution from any person who was not found guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. </FONT></P>
