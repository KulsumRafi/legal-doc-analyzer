Supplement to Exploration Agreement (the &#147;Supplement&#148;) is dated as of December

Comstock Offshore, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company (&#147;Comstock&#148;), Bois
d&#146;Arc Offshore, Ltd., a Texas limited partnership (&#147;Bois d&#146;Arc Ltd.&#148;),
Bois d&#146;Arc Oil &amp; Gas Company, LLC, a Texas limited liability company (&#147;Bois

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Indent Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Project" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
the parties hereto are parties to the 2001 Exploration Agreement effective as of April 1,
2001 (the &#147;Exploration Agreement&#148;) pursuant to which they have agreed to pursue
a joint exploration program with respect to certain properties identified by Bois
d&#146;Arc; </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Indent Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Project" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
Bois d&#146;Arc has identified certain properties to be acquired (the &#147;Murphy
Acquisition&#148;) from Murphy Exploration and Production Company (&#147;Murphy&#148;);
and </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Indent Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Project" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
the parties desire that the development of the properties from Murphy be subject to the
terms of this Supplement rather than the Exploration Agreement, except as otherwise
provided herein. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Indent Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Project" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW,
THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual agreements herein contained and other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the
parties hereby agree as follows: </FONT></P>

          Comstock shall pay 100% of the costs to acquire the properties from Murphy,
          which are more fully described on Schedule I hereto (the &#147;Subject
          Properties&#148;). Comstock shall then assign to Bois d&#146;Arc at no cost a
          10% interest of the working interest acquired from Murphy in the Subject
          Properties (including production, facilities, pipelines and responsibility for
          plugging and abandonment). Such assignment shall be effective the first day of
          the calendar month in which the Murphy Acquisition is closed. To the extent
          permitted, Comstock will grant to Bois d&#146;Arc a license with respect to the
          seismic data, if any, acquired in the Murphy Acquisition. </FONT></TD>

          <TD WIDTH=95%><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
          Comstock shall also assign to Bois d&#146;Arc an overriding royalty interest
          equal to 2% of 8/8ths proportionately reduced to the working interest acquired
          from Murphy in the Subject Properties. Such overriding royalty interest will be
          attributable to the leases and all production therefrom, with the exception of
          production from existing wellbores listed on Schedule II attached hereto. The
          overriding royalty interest will apply to all future wells drilled, sidetracked
          or deepened, including the sidetracking or deepening of any wellbore listed on
          Schedule II. (These projects will be undertaken in an effort to discover and
          produce unique reserves not obtainable from the wellbores listed on Schedule
          II.) The overriding royalty interest shall not apply to any such well drilled or
          sidetracked as a replacement well for any of the wellbores listed on
          Schedule&nbsp;II as long as such replacement wellbore stays within 100 feet
          horizontally of the wellbore being replaced. The overriding royalty interest
          will apply to any wells completed in or in the future recompleted into the
          proposed M-8 sand water flood reservoir. The assignment of any overriding
          royalty interest described in this Section 2 shall be effective the first day of
          the month in which the Murphy Acquisition is closed. </FONT></TD>

          Bois d&#146;Arc shall have the option to be assigned an additional 15% of the
          initial working interest acquired from Murphy once Comstock receives net
          proceeds from the Subject Properties that allow it to recover its investment in
          the acquisition, including all transaction costs and capital expenditures made
          on the Subject Properties, and earn a 15% annual return on its unrecovered
          investment in the Subject Properties. Such option shall be exercisable for a
          period of thirty (30) days commencing at the beginning of the month subsequent
          to the month that the payout described herein occurs. The annual return shall be
          calculated on a monthly basis from the date the acquisition closed based on
          Comstock&#146;s unrecovered investment multiplied by 15% per annum. The
          unrecovered investment shall be the total of (i) the purchase price paid for the
          Subject Properties after all price adjustments including pre-closing revenues
          and expenses and all transaction expenses plus (ii) any operating expenses and
          capital expenditures incurred with respect to the Subject Properties less (iii)
          net revenues received by Comstock from the Subject Properties. </FONT></TD>

          will open an office that will have the first level of responsibility and
          authority for the daily operation and development of the Subject Properties.
          Comstock agrees to locate such office in close proximity to Bois
          d&#146;Arc&#146;s Houston office and provide Bois d&#146;Arc full access at all
          times to the personnel and files in such office in connection with Bois
          d&#146;Arc&#146;s ownership interest in the Subject Properties. Through December

          Comstock desires to designate or hire to manage the Subject Properties
          (&#147;Comstock Personnel&#148;), including any independent third party
          consultants, contractors and field personnel. </FONT></TD>

          In consideration for the interests being conveyed to Bois d&#146;Arc pursuant to
          this Agreement, until December 31, 2006 Bois d&#146;Arc agrees to provide at no
          cost to Comstock certain geological, engineering and other technical personnel
          (&#147;Bois d&#146;Arc Personnel&#148;), which Bois d&#146;Arc, in its sole and
          reasonable discretion, deems necessary for the operation and development of the
          Subject Properties. The Bois d&#146;Arc Personnel will work in conjunction with
          the Comstock Personnel and be involved in all decisions relative to the
          management and operation of the Subject Properties. If the Bois d&#146;Arc
          Personnel and Comstock Personnel are unable to agree upon the day-to-day

          considerations and strategy, such issues will be resolved jointly by the chief
          executive officer of Comstock and Laufer and Blackie. </FONT></TD>
