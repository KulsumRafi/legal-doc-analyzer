                  AGREED MOTION FOR DISMISSAL WITH PREJUDICE

         Pursuant to Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 8001(c)(2),
appellant Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors of Comdisco, Inc. et al.
(the "Creditors Committee") and appellees Comdisco, Inc., et al. (the
"Debtors" or "Comdisco"), the parties to this appeal (collectively, the
"Parties"), hereby move this Court as follows:

         1. This appeal arises from a dispute regarding the Debtors'
assumption of the pre-petition employment agreement (the "Employment
Agreement") of the Debtors' chief executive officer, Mr. Norman P. Blake, Jr.
(the "Executive"), a copy of which is found at Tab 6 in the record on appeal
(the "Record"). On August 30, 2001, the United States Bankruptcy Court for the
Northern District of Illinois entered an order approving the Debtors'
assumption of the Employment Agreement (the "Bankruptcy Court Order").
Paragraph 3 of the Bankruptcy Court Order, which is found at tab 11 in the
Record, incorporated an agreement between the Debtors and the Executive to cap
the Executive's total compensation under both the incentive and severance
provisions of the Employment Agreement, including without limitation ss.ss. 2
and 4 of the Employment Agreement, to a maximum of $9.6 million in the
aggregate.

         2. The Parties, in a good faith effort to resolve this dispute, have
agreed to settle and compromise this appeal by agreeing to limit the
Executive's total compensation under both the incentive and severance
provisions of the Employment Agreement, including without limitation ss.ss. 2
and 4 of the Employment Agreement, to a maximum of $7.25 million in the
aggregate. The Parties have not agreed to modify, and have not modified, any
other provision or term of the Employment Agreement or Bankruptcy Court Order.

         3. The Parties attach hereto an Agreed Order for Dismissal With
Prejudice incorporating the Parties' settlement and resolving this matter in
full.

         4. The Parties therefore request that this Court enter the Agreed
Order dismissing this appeal with prejudice pursuant to the terms set forth
therein.

         WHEREFORE, for the reasons set forth above, the Parties respectfully
request that this Court grant this Agreed Motion and enter the Agreed Order
dismissing the above-captioned appeal with prejudice.

Dated:    March 7, 2002
