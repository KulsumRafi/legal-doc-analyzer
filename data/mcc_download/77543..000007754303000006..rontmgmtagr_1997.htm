<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THIS
MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT (the &#147;Agreement&#148;) is made and entered into as of
January 17, 1997 by and among Perini Corporation, a Massachusetts corporation
(&#147;Perini&#148;), Tutor-Saliba Corporation, a California corporation
(&#147;Tutor-Saliba&#148;) and Ronald N. Tutor (&#147;Tutor&#148;), an
individual and President of Tutor-Saliba. </P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
Perini has had some difficulty meeting its cash requirements for the past year
due to, inter alia, its high level of capital-intensive civil construction work
and the cash support required by its real estate assets; </P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
Perini&#146;s financial condition has impeded its ability to perform on existing
projects and to bid on new projects; </P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
during the course of 1996, Perini engaged in an extensive search for new capital
to support its cash needs and to provide it the opportunity to improve
operations and improve its competitiveness in the general contracting and
construction industry; </P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
as a result of its search for capital, Perini entered into a Stock Purchase and
Sale Agreement dated July 24, 1996 by and among Perini, PB Capital Partners,
L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (&#147;PB Capital Partners&#148;), and
Richard C. Blum &amp; Associates, L.P., a California limited partnership
(&#147;RCBA&#148;) (as amended through the date hereof, the &#147;Stock Purchase
Agreement&#148;), pursuant to which it is contemplated that Perini will issue
convertible preferred stock to PB Capital Partners in exchange for an investment
by PB Capital Partners of $30,030,000 (the &#147;Investment&#148;); </P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;         WHEREAS, Tutor-Saliba is a limited partner of PB Capital Partners;</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
Tutor-Saliba directly owns approximately 7.24% of the outstanding common stock,
par value $1.00 per share (the &#147;Common Stock&#148;) of Perini; </P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
Tutor-Saliba has from time to time engaged in construction joint ventures with
Perini under the name Tutor-Saliba/Perini; </P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
considering the existing and potential relationships, direct and indirect,
between Tutor-Saliba and Perini, as well as Tutor&#146;s expertise and
achievements in the construction industry, the parties hereto desire, in
connection with and contingent upon the Investment, that Tutor-Saliba provide
the services of Tutor to Perini, for the purpose of providing direction to
Perini with respect to its ongoing and future construction operations and
improving Perini&#146;s operating efficiency and thus its ability to
successfully compete for new projects and in new areas;</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW
THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and of the mutual covenants herein
contained, the parties hereby agree as follows: </P>

<HR SIZE=1 NOSHADE>


 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        1.       <u>Effectiveness</u>.  Unless sooner terminated pursuant to Section 6 hereof, this Agreement shall

 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        2.       <u>Management</u>.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;                  (a)      Tutor-Saliba and Tutor each hereby agree to provide to Perini the management services
of Tutor, to assist Perini from time to time (but for no more than ten (10) days in any calendar month, unless
the parties otherwise agree in writing) as described in Section 2(b) hereof or as the parties hereto may
otherwise agree.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;                  (b)      Tutor shall initially serve as acting Chief Operating Officer of Perini, and will
provide direction with respect to Perini's ongoing and future construction operations, with the goal of achieving
greater operating efficiencies, reducing Perini's need for working capital, reducing Perini's exposure to risk by
negotiating and bidding on construction projects that will yield higher profit margins than current projects,
negotiating with Perini's lenders, bonding companies and insurers, and generally improving Perini's cash flow
situation and competitive position in the general contracting and construction industry.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;                  (c)      Perini hereby agrees to take all action which may be required to:  (i) appoint Tutor
acting Chief Operating Officer of Perini; (ii) provide Tutor with the use of an office at Perini's principal
executive offices and administrative and other support services as may be reasonably necessary in connection with
the performance of Tutor's services under Section 2(b) hereof; (iii) make available to Tutor the services of such
of its employees and consultants as may be reasonably necessary to the performance of the services described in
Section 2(b) above; and (iv) issue the Option (as defined below) and otherwise pay the management fee pursuant to
Section 3 hereof.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;         3.       <u>Compensation</u>.  In return for the provision of Tutor's services, Perini shall pay a management
fee as follows:</P>

 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;                 (a)      On the Effective Date, Perini shall issue to Tutor, pursuant to Perini's 1982 Stock
Option and Long-Term Performance Incentive Compensation Plan, as amended (the "Plan") (or, in the event options
are unavailable for issuance under such plan, with similar terms and conditions as under the Plan), an option
(the "Option") exercisable for 150,000 shares of Common Stock, with an exercise price per share equal to the
closing price of the Common Stock on the American Stock Exchange on the day prior to the Effective Date.  The
Option will first become exercisable forty months after the Effective Date.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                  (b)      Beginning on the Effective Date, Perini shall pay a fee to Tutor-Saliba at the rate of
$150,000 per year, such amount to be paid in twelve equal monthly installments in arrears on the 15th of each
month, or as the parties hereto shall otherwise agree in writing.</P>

or guaranty to Perini relating to the services to be performed by Tutor pursuant to this Agreement or the quality

or affiliates or to any third party for failure to perform the services to be performed by either of them
pursuant to this Agreement for any expense, claim, loss or damage, including, without limitation, indirect,
special, consequential or exemplary damages, suffered other than by reason of such party's intentional failure to
perform the services to be performed by such party pursuant to this Agreement, or by reason of action taken or
omitted to be taken by such party which was in bad faith and in a manner not reasonably believed by such party to
be in the best interests of Perini.</P>

                                                     <P ALIGN=CENTER><u>EXHIBIT A</u></P>





<P>Section 9.        <u>Indemnification of Directors and Officers</u></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9.1 <U>General</U>. Subject to the provision of this Section and any limitations
imposed by law, the corporation shall indemnify its directors and officers
against all expenses incurred by them in connection with any proceeding in which
they are involved by reason of their serving in such capacities except that (i)
no indemnification shall be provided for any director or officer with respect to
any matter as to which he shall have been adjudicated not to have acted in good
faith and in the reasonable belief that his action was in the best interests of
the corporation, or with respect to a criminal matter, that he had reasonable
cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful, and (ii) no indemnification
shall be provided by any director or officer with respect to a proceeding by or
in the right of the corporation in which he is adjudicated to be liable to the
corporation. Such indemnification may be provided to an officer or director in
connection with a proceeding in which it is alleged that he received an improper
personal benefit by reason of his position, regardless of whether the claim
involves his services in such capacity, subject to the foregoing limitation,
unless it shall have been determined that an improper personal benefit was
received by the director or officer. Except as provided in Section 9.2,
indemnification under this Section 9 shall be authorized in each case as
determined by the board of directors, which may act notwithstanding that one or
more of these members are parties to the proceeding in question or otherwise
have an interest in such indemnification. </P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9.2 <U>Mandatory Indemnification</U>. Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this
Section, if a director or officer of the corporation has been wholly successful
on the merits in defense of any proceeding in which he was involved by reason of
his position or as a result of his serving in such capacity (including the
termination of investigative or other proceedings without a finding of fault on
the part of the director or officer), he shall be indemnified by the corporation
against all expenses incurred by him in connection therewith. </P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9.3      <u>Definitions</u>.  For purposes of this Section 9:</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;                  (a)  A "director" or "officer" means any person serving in an office filled by appointment or
election by the directors or the stockholders and also includes (i) a director or officer of the corporation
serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee, trustee, partner or other agent of
another organization (ii) any person who formerly served as a director or officer, and (iii) the heirs or
personal representatives of such persons;</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;                 (b)  "Expenses" means all expenses (including attorney's fees and disbursements) actually and
reasonably incurred in defense of a proceeding or in successfully seeking </p>

<HR SIZE=1 NOSHADE>

<p>indemnification under Section 9.2
hereof, and any judgments, awards, fines, penalties and reasonable amounts paid in settlement of a proceeding; and
</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;                  (c)  A "proceeding" means any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding,
whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, and any claim which could be the subject of a
proceeding.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9.4 <U>Advances</U>. Except as limited by law, expenses incurred by a director or
officer in defending any proceeding in which he is involved by reason of serving
in such capacities may be paid by the corporation in advance of final
disposition of the proceeding upon receipt of his written undertaking to repay
such amount if it is ultimately determined that he is not eligible to be
indemnified, which undertaking shall be an unlimited general obligation but need
not be secured and may be accepted without regard to the financial ability of
such persons to make repayment; provided, that no such advance payment shall be
made if it is determined by the board of directors on the basis of the
circumstances known at the time (without further investigation) that said
director or officer will ultimately be ineligible to be indemnified under this
Section 9. </P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9.5 <U>Settlement Proceedings</U>. If a proceeding is compromised or settlement in a
matter which imposes a liability or obligation upon a director or officer, (i)
no indemnification shall be provided to him with respect to a proceeding by or
in the right of the corporation unless the board of directors determines in its
discretion that indemnification is appropriate under the circumstances, and (ii)
no indemnification shall be provided to him with respect to any other type of
proceeding if it is determined by the board of directors that said director or
officer is ineligible to be indemnified under this Section 9. The determination
by the board of directors in each case shall be made on the basis of the
circumstances known to it at that time without further investigation. </P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9.6 <U>Insurance</U>. The corporation shall have power to purchase and maintain
insurance on behalf of any director, officer, employee or agent of the
corporation against any liability or cost incurred by him in any such capacity
or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the corporation would have
the power to indemnify him against such liability or cost. </P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9.7 <U>Employee Benefit Plans</U>. If the corporation or any of its directors or
offices sponsors, undertakes or incurs any responsibility as a fiduciary with
respect to an employee benefit plan, then, for purposes of indemnification of
such person under this Section (i) a &#147;director&#148; or &#147;officer&#148;
shall be deemed to include any director or officer of the corporation who serves
at its request in any capacity with respect to said plan, (ii) such director or
officer shall be deemed not to have failed to have acted in good faith and in
the reasonable belief that his action has in the best interests of the
corporation if he acted in good faith and in the reasonable belief that his
action was in the best interest of the participants or beneficiaries of said
plan, and (iii) &#147;expenses&#148; shall be deemed to include any taxes or
penalties assessed on such director or officer with respect to said plan under
applicable law. </P>

<HR SIZE=1 NOSHADE>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9.8
<U>Other Provisions</U>. The provisions of this Section 9 shall not be construed
to limit the power of the corporation to indemnify its officers or directors to
the full extent permitted by law and enter specific agreements or arrangements
for this purpose. In addition, the corporation shall have power to indemnify any
of its agents or employees or employees who are not directors or officers on any
terms consistent with law which it deems to be appropriate. </P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9.9
<U>Amendment</U>. The provisions of this Section 9 may be amended or repealed by
the stockholders; however, no such amendment or repeal which adversely affects
the rights of a director or officer under this Section 9 with respect to his
acts or omissions at any time prior to such amendment or repeal, shall apply to
him without consent. </P>
