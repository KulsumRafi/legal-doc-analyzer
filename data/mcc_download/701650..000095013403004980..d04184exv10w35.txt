         1. CERTAIN TERMS.

                  (a) Capitalized terms used herein without definition have the

         2. GUARANTY. The Guarantors hereby, jointly and severally, absolutely,
unconditionally and irrevocably guarantee to the Purchasers the full and
punctual payment when due of all Obligations, whether at stated maturity, by
required prepayment, declaration, acceleration, demand or otherwise, and such
guaranty is not conditional or contingent upon pursuit by the Purchasers of any
prior action or proceeding for collection, or for any other remedies the
Purchasers may have, against the Company or any other Person.

         3. CONSENT. The Guarantors hereby consent and agree that the whole or
any part of the security now or hereafter held for any Obligation may be
exchanged, compromised, released or surrendered from time to time; that the time
or place of payment of any Obligation or of any security therefor may be
exchanged or extended, in whole or in part, to a time certain or otherwise, and
may be renewed or accelerated, in whole or in part; that the Company and any
Guarantor or any other obligor on the Obligations may be granted indulgences
generally; that any of the provisions of the Notes may be renewed, extended,
modified, increased, accelerated, compromised, refinanced or waived; that
neither the insolvency, bankruptcy and/or dissolution of the Borrower, any
Guarantor or any other obligor on the Obligations, shall affect the obligations
hereunder of any Guarantor; that neither the invalidity or unenforceability of
any of the Obligations shall affect the obligations hereunder of any Guarantor;
that no claim need be asserted against any trustee in bankruptcy or receiver or
other representative in the event the Borrower, any Guarantor or any other
obligor on the Obligations is adjudicated bankrupt or becomes insolvent; and
that any property to the credit of the Borrower or any Guarantor or any other
party liable for payment of any of the Obligations or liable upon any security
therefor may be released from time to time, in whole or in part, at, before or
after the stated, extended or accelerated maturity of such Obligations, all of
which (i) may be affected without notice to or further assent by any Guarantor
and (ii) shall not affect the obligations of any Guarantor under this Guaranty.

         4. WAIVER. The Guarantors hereby expressly waive:

                  (a) Notice of acceptance of this Guaranty;

                  (b) Presentment and demand for payment of any Obligation;

                  (c) Protest and notice of dishonor or default to such
         Guarantor or to any other party with respect to any Obligation or any
         security for any Obligation;

<PAGE>
               (d) Demand for payment under this Guaranty;

               (e) Notice of disposition of any security for any Obligation; and

               (f) Any defense by reason of impairment of: (i) any security now
         or hereafter held for any Obligation; or (ii) recourse against any
         party liable for the payment of any Obligation.

         5. GUARANTY OF PAYMENT. This Guaranty is a guaranty of payment and not
of collection. Each Guarantor: (a) waives any claim to marshaling of assets; (b)
waives any right to require that an action be brought against Borrower or any
other Person prior to action against such Guarantor or any other Guarantor
hereunder; and (c) waives any right to require that resort be had to any
security, as applicable, for the Notes or any other Obligations guaranteed
hereunder prior to action by any Purchaser against such Guarantor hereunder.
Each Guarantor shall be released from all liability hereunder only upon payment
in full in cash of all the Obligations.

         6. BINDING EFFECT. The obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall be
joint and several obligations of all of the Guarantors. The provisions of this
Guaranty shall be binding upon each Guarantor and its successors and assigns,
and shall inure to the benefit of the Purchasers and their respective successors
and assigns; it being understood that each Purchaser is free to assign its
rights, benefits, duties and obligations under this Guaranty without the consent
of any other party, and each Guarantor may not assign its rights, benefits,
duties and obligations under this Guaranty without the prior written consent of
each of the Purchasers.

         7. RIGHT OF SET OFF. The Purchasers agree that to the extent that the
Guarantors have made payment hereunder of all or any portion of principal and
interest required under the Notes, the full amount of such payment shall be
deducted from amounts allocable and payable to the Purchasers pursuant to the
Notes.

         8. LIMITATION OF GUARANTY. Any term or provision of this Guaranty or
any other Transaction Document to the contrary notwithstanding, the maximum
aggregate amount of the Obligations for which the Guarantors shall be liable
shall not exceed the maximum amount for which the Guarantors can be liable
without rendering this Guaranty or any other Transaction Document, as it relates
to the Guarantors, voidable under applicable law relating to fraudulent
conveyance or fraudulent transfer.

         9. REINSTATEMENT. This Guaranty shall remain in full force and effect
and continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any
time payment or performance of the Obligations, or any part thereof, is,
pursuant to applicable law, rescinded or reduced in amount, or must otherwise be
restored or returned by any obligee of the Obligations or such part thereof,
whether as a "voidable preference," "fraudulent transfer," or otherwise, all as
though such payment or performance had not been made. In the event that any
payment, or any part thereof, is rescinded, reduced, restored or returned, the
Obligations shall, to the fullest extent permitted




                                       3
<PAGE>
by law, be reinstated and deemed reduced only by such amount paid and not so
rescinded, reduced, restored or returned.

         10. SUBROGATION. After (and not before) all amounts payable under or in
respect of all the Notes have been indefeasibly paid in full in cash, the
Guarantors shall be subrogated to the rights of the Purchasers to receive
payments in respect of the Notes, but only to the extent of amounts paid by the
Guarantors pursuant to this Guaranty.

         11. AMENDMENT. This Guaranty may not be modified or amended except by a
writing duly executed by the party to be charged.

         12. LAW. THIS GUARANTY SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE
WITH, AND ENFORCED UNDER, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK APPLICABLE TO
AGREEMENTS OR INSTRUMENTS ENTERED INTO AND PERFORMED ENTIRELY WITHIN SUCH STATE.

         13. SEVERABILITY. Wherever possible, each provision of this Guaranty
shall be interpreted in such a manner as to be effective and valid under
applicable law, but if any provision of this Guaranty shall be invalid under
such laws, such provision shall be effective only to the extent of such
prohibition or invalidity, without affecting the remainder of such provision or
the remaining provisions of this Guaranty, which shall be binding and
enforceable to the fullest extent allowable by law.

         14. WAIVER. Waiver by any Purchaser of a breach of this Guaranty shall
not operate as a waiver of any subsequent breach thereof.

         15. SIGNATURES; COUNTERPARTS. Telefacsimile transmissions of any
executed original document and/or retransmission of any executed telefacsimile
transmission shall be deemed to be the same as the delivery of an executed
original. At the request of any party hereto, the other parties hereto shall
confirm telefacsimile transmissions by executing duplicate original documents
and delivering the same to the requesting party or parties. This Guaranty may be
executed in any number of counterparts and by the parties hereto in separate
counterparts, each of which when so executed shall be deemed to be an original
and all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

         16. NOTICES. All notices, requests and other communications to be given
or otherwise made to any party hereto shall be deemed to be sufficient if
contained in a written instrument duly transmitted by telecopy or telex or duly
sent by overnight courier service or first class registered or certified mail,
postage prepaid, addressed to such party at the address set forth below or at
such other address as may hereafter be designated in writing by the addressee to
