         4. Except to the extent its provisions are specifically amended,

<PAGE>
                  (e) Certificates of Incorporation and Bylaws. The Agent shall
         have received copies of Certificates of Incorporation for Borrower and
         each Guarantor (including REFC) together with all amendments thereto,
         appropriately certified by governmental authority in the jurisdiction
         of incorporation of Borrower and each Guarantor, and a copy of the
         Bylaws of Borrower and each Guarantor, and all amendments thereto,
         certified by one or more officers of Borrower and each Guarantor, as
         the case may be, as being true, correct and complete;

                  (f) Incumbency. To the extent not already received, the Agent
         shall have received a signed Certificate of Borrower and each
         Guarantor, certifying the names of the officers of Borrower and each
         Guarantor authorized to sign loan documents on behalf of Borrower and
         each Guarantor, together with the true signatures of each such officer.
         The Agent may conclusively rely on each such Certificate until the
         Agent receives a further Certificate of Borrower and/or any Guarantor
         canceling or amending the prior Certificate and submitting signatures
         of the officers named in such further Certificate;

                  (g) Payoff of Indebtedness of REFC. The Agent shall have
         received satisfactory evidence that all indebtedness owed pursuant to
         that certain Credit Agreement dated as of December 14, 1999 among Range
         Energy Finance Corporation, Credit Lyonnais New York Branch, and
         Compass Bank shall have been paid in full and all Liens given to secure
         the same shall have been, or shall be, within a reasonable time,
         released:

                  (h) Representations and Warranties. The representations and
         warranties of the Borrowers under this First Amendment are true and
         correct in all material respects as of such date, as if then made
         (except to the extent that such representations and warranties related
         solely to an earlier date);

                  (i) No Event of Default. No Event of Default shall have
         occurred and be continuing nor shall any event have occurred or failed
         to occur which, with the passage of time or service of notice, or both,
         would constitute an Event of Default;

                  (j) Other Documents. The Agent shall have received such other
         instruments and documents incidental and appropriate to the transaction
         provided for herein as the Agent or its counsel may reasonably request,
         and all such documents shall be in form and substance satisfactory to
         the Agent;

                  (k) Legal Matters Satisfactory. All legal matters incident to
         the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby shall be
         reasonably satisfactory to special counsel for the Agent retained at
         the expense of Borrower.

         7. Borrower hereby represents and warrants that all factual information
heretofore and contemporaneously furnished by or on behalf of Borrower to Agent
for purposes of or in connection with this First Amendment does not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary
to keep the statements contained herein or therein from being misleading. Each
of the foregoing representations and warranties shall constitute a


                                       -3-


<PAGE>
representation and warranty of Borrower made under the Credit Agreement, and it
shall be an Event of Default if any such representation and warranty shall prove
to have been incorrect or false in any material respect at the time given. Each
of the representations and warranties made under the Credit Agreement (including
those made herein) shall survive and not be waived by the execution and delivery
of this First Amendment or any investigation by Lenders.

         8. The Borrower agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Lenders and
their respective officers, employees, agents, attorneys and representatives
(singularly, an "Indemnified Party", and collectively, the "Indemnified
Parties") from and against any loss, cost, liability, damage or expense
(including the reasonable fees and out-of-pocket expenses of counsel to the
Lender, including all local counsel hired by such counsel) ("Claim") incurred by
the Lenders in investigating or preparing for, defending against, or providing
evidence, producing documents or taking any other action in respect of any
commenced or threatened litigation, administrative proceeding or investigation
under any federal securities law, federal or state environmental law, or any
other statute of any jurisdiction, or any regulation, or at common law or
otherwise, which is alleged to arise out of or is based upon any acts, practices
or omissions or alleged acts, practices or omissions of the Borrower or its
agents or arises in connection with the duties, obligations or performance of
the Indemnified Parties in negotiating, preparing, executing, accepting,
keeping, completing, countersigning, issuing, selling, delivering, releasing,
assigning, handling, certifying, processing or receiving or taking any other
action with respect to the Loan Documents and all documents, items and materials
contemplated thereby even if any of the foregoing arises out of an Indemnified
Party's ordinary negligence. The indemnity set forth herein shall be in addition
to any other obligations or liabilities of the Borrower to the Lenders hereunder
or at common law or otherwise, and shall survive any termination of this First
Amendment, the expiration of the Loan and the payment of all indebtedness of the
Borrower to the Lenders hereunder and under the Notes, provided that the
Borrower shall have no obligation under this section to the Lenders with respect
to any of the foregoing arising out of the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of the Lenders. If any Claim is asserted against any Indemnified
Party, the Indemnified Party shall endeavor to notify the Borrower of such Claim
(but failure to do so shall not affect the indemnification herein made except to
the extent of the actual harm caused by such failure). The Indemnified Party
shall have the right to employ, at the Borrower's expense, counsel of the
Indemnified Parties' choosing and to control the defense of the Claim. The
Borrower may at its own expense also participate in the defense of any Claim.
Each Indemnified Party may employ separate counsel in connection with any Claim
to the extent such Indemnified Party believes it reasonably prudent to protect
such Indemnified Party. THE PARTIES INTEND FOR THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION TO
APPLY TO AND PROTECT EACH INDEMNIFIED PARTY FROM THE CONSEQUENCES OF STRICT
LIABILITY IMPOSED OR THREATENED TO BE IMPOSED ON ANY INDEMNIFIED PARTY AS WELL
AS FROM THE CONSEQUENCES OF ITS OWN NEGLIGENCE, WHETHER OR NOT THAT NEGLIGENCE
IS THE SOLE, CONTRIBUTING, OR CONCURRING CAUSE OF ANY CLAIM.

         9. This First Amendment may be executed in any number of counterparts
and all of such counterparts taken together shall be deemed to constitute one
and the same instrument.

         10. WRITTEN CREDIT AGREEMENT. THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, AS AMENDED BY THIS
FIRST AMENDMENT REPRESENTS THE FINAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN AND AMONG THE PARTIES AND
MAY NOT BE CONTRADICTED BY

                                       -4-


<PAGE>
EVIDENCE OF PRIOR, CONTEMPORANEOUS OR SUBSEQUENT ORAL AGREEMENTS OF THE PARTIES.
THERE ARE NO UNWRITTEN ORAL AGREEMENTS BETWEEN AND AMONG THE PARTIES.

         11. The Guarantors hereby consent to the execution of this First
Amendment by the Borrower and reaffirms their guaranties of all of the
obligations of the Borrower to the Lenders. Borrower and Guarantors acknowledge
and agree that the renewal, extension and amendment of the Credit Agreement
shall not be considered a novation of account or new contract but that all
existing rights, titles, powers, and estates in favor of the Lenders constitute
valid and existing obligations in favor of the Lenders. Borrower and Guarantors
each confirm and agree that (a) neither the execution of this First Amendment or
any other Loan Document nor the consummation of the transactions described
herein and therein shall in any way effect, impair or limit the covenants,
liabilities, obligations and duties of the Borrower and the Guarantors under the
Loan Documents and (b) the obligations evidenced and secured by the Loan
Documents continue in full force and effect. Each Guarantor hereby further
confirms that it unconditionally guarantees to the extent set forth in their
respective Guaranties the due and punctual payment and performance of any and
all amounts and obligations owed to the Lenders under the Credit Agreement or
the other Loan Documents.

         IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have caused this First Amendment to
Credit Agreement to be duly executed as of the date first above written.
