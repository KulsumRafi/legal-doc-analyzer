made, as the case may be, in accordance with GAAP, consistently applied, unless
such principles are inconsistent with any express provision of this Agreement.

            1.4. Business Day. Whenever any payment or other obligation
hereunder, under the Note or any other Loan Document, is due on a day other than
a Business Day, such shall be paid or performed on the Business Day next
following the prescribed due date, except as otherwise specifically provided for
herein to the contrary, and such extension of time shall be included in the
computation of interest and charges. Any reference made herein or in any other


                                       7
<PAGE>
Loan Document to an hour of day shall refer to the then prevailing time in
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, unless specifically provided herein to the contrary.

            1.5. Borrower's Authorization to Charge Accounts. Whenever Borrower
is obligated hereunder or under the Note or any other Loan Document to make
payments of any nature to Bank, including payments of principal, interest and
Bank's Costs, Bank shall be entitled, and Borrower hereby authorizes Bank, to
debit from Account Number 12001585 (ABA# 031101114) established with The
Bancorp.com Bank (or if such account is closed by the Borrower any Deposit
Account of Borrower at Bank), the amount of such payment due; provided, however,

currently due payments to Bank, Borrower shall immediately pay to Bank the
difference.

            1.6. Bank's Costs. Borrower shall pay Bank on demand all Bank's
Costs. Until paid, all past due and owing interest payments, fees and Bank's
Costs shall be deemed to be part of the principal balance of the Line and bear
interest at the highest Interest Rate on Advances from time to time outstanding
or if no Advances are outstanding, the higher of the LIBOR Interest Rate or the
Wall Street Prime Interest Rate. The obligations of Borrower under this Section
shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Line of
Credit Note.

      SECTION 2. LOAN

            2.1. The Line of Credit.

                  2.1.1. Line Established. Provided that no Event of Default or
Unmatured Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, and subject to the
terms and conditions set forth herein, commencing on the Closing Date and
expiring on the day next preceding the Line Termination Date, Bank shall, upon
Borrower's requests from time to time, extend one or more Advances to Borrower,
the aggregate of which outstanding at any one time shall not exceed the Maximum
Available Credit. The Line shall be used by the Borrower to refinance existing
indebtedness of the Borrower with Bank, to acquire income producing assets,
including properties purchased by the Borrower and loans and investments by
Borrower in the ordinary course of its business or to replenish funds of the
Borrower which were used for one of the foregoing purposes. Borrower, prior to
the Line Termination Date, may borrow, repay and, subject to the provisions of
this Agreement, re-borrow under the Line.

                  2.1.2. Advances.

                        (a) Subject to compliance with the provisions of this
Agreement, Borrower may request Advances under the Line in such amounts as may
be set forth by Borrower. On the date hereof, Borrower shall execute the Line of
Credit Note.

                        (b) In connection with each Advance, Borrower shall
execute and deliver a Funding Request, in the form of Exhibit 2.1.2(b) attached
hereto


                                       8
<PAGE>
                        (c) The Collateral pledged to secure Advances shall
include Real Property (other than land) consisting of apartment units, retail
space, class A or B office space or light industrial properties located in major
metropolitan areas in (i) the so-called Boston, Massachusetts to Northern
Virginia corridor or (ii) the State of Florida. The Borrower shall use an
Advance either to (i) acquire particular Real Property, (ii) to make a loan, in
the ordinary course of Borrower's business to the Person, or an entity related
to such Person, which owns or is acquiring particular Real Property or (iii) to
replenish funds of the Borrower which were used for one of the foregoing
purposes.

                        (d) The underwriting criteria of the Bank with respect
to the Collateral used to secure a requested Advance shall be as follows: (i)
the Debt Service Coverage Ratio shall be not less than 1.30 based on a twenty
(20) year amortization (twenty-five (25) with respect to multi-family
properties), as calculated by the Bank, with respect to the particular Real
Property for which an Advance is requested and (ii) the Loan to Value Ratio
shall be not less than 75%. The amount of the Advance which enables Borrower to
be in compliance with the foregoing covenant shall constitute the A Advance.
Amounts of Advances requested in excess of the A Advance shall constitute the B
Advance; provided however, the aggregate amount of B Advances at any time
outstanding shall not exceed the sum of Five Million ($5,000,000) Dollars and no
B Advance with respect to any Real Property shall be made to the extent that
such B Advance, together with the A Advance for such Real Property exceeds 100%
of the appraised value of such Real Property as determined by the Bank.

                        (e) Borrower shall provide Collateral to Bank in
connection with each Advance. Such Collateral shall be in form and substance
satisfactory to Bank, shall secure all Advances hereunder and shall include,
without limitation (i) if the underlying Collateral is Real Property, (a) a
mortgage constituting a first lien on the Real Property, subject to no other
liens and encumbrances, except as may be approved by Bank, and insured for the
full amount of the Advance by title insurance issued by a reputable title
insurance company doing business in the state in which the Real Property is
located and satisfactory to the Bank and (b) an assignment of rents, leases and
profits with respect to leases at the Real Property; and (ii) if the underlying
Collateral is a loan, an assignment of the Note evidencing the loan and all
security which secures such loan, all in such form and substance as shall be
satisfactory to the Bank. Borrower shall also execute in favor of Bank in
connection with each Advance, such amendments to the Loan Documents and such
additional documents and opinions of counsel as the Bank shall require in order
to create a security interest in and perfect such security interest in the
Collateral. Borrower shall also provide to the Bank evidence of insurance on the
Collateral in such amounts and with such coverages as shall be acceptable to the
Bank, and all environmental assessments with respect to the Real Property as the
Bank shall require.

                        (f) In connection with each Advance, Borrower shall
elect the Interest Rate to be applicable to the Advance, which rate shall be
either the Wall Street Prime Interest Rate or the LIBOR Interest Rate. Such
designation shall be irrevocable as to such Advance.

            2.1.3. Interest Rate. Each Advance hereunder shall bear interest at
a floating rate of interest per annum equal to the LIBOR Interest Rate or the
Wall Street Prime Interest Rate as elected as to such Advance by the Borrower at
the time of such Advance as


                                       9
<PAGE>
provided in Section 2.1.2 (f) hereof. If no election is made by Borrower to Bank
with respect to an Advance, such Advance shall bear interest at the Wall Street
Prime Interest Rate. Interest shall be calculated on the basis of a 360-day
year, but charged for the actual number of days elapsed in any particular
period.

                  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set fort in the
preceding paragraph, the interest rate for any day as to any Advance shall not
be less than 4.75% per annum.

            2.1.4. Principal and Interest Payments. Interest on the Line shall
be due and payable (i) monthly, in arrears, on the first day of each month,
commencing on November 1, 2002, (ii) on the Line Termination Date, (iii) on the
date of the payment of the principal amount of any Advance on the amount of such
Advance and (iv) on the Maturity Date. The principal amount outstanding on the
Line shall be due and payable, subject to the provisions of Section 8 hereof, as
follows:

                        (a) A Advances shall be payable on the earlier of (i)
the sale or refinancing of the Real Property which is underlying Collateral
pledged to secure the A Advance or the loan made by the Borrower in the ordinary
course of its business with respect to such Real Property which is underlying
Collateral pledged to secure the A Advance or (ii) twelve (12) months following
the Line Termination Date.

                        (b) B Advances shall be payable at the same times as are
set forth in Section 2.1.4 (a) hereof; provided, however, that in connection
with an event set forth in Section 2.1.4 (a)(i) hereof, the Borrower may request
a sixty (60) day extension to pay the principal of such B Advance, such
extension shall be at the sole discretion of the Bank.

                        (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
herein, the principal of all Advances shall be due and payable, if not paid
earlier by operation of (a) and (b) hereof, on the Maturity Date.

            2.2. Payments. All payments hereunder shall be made by Borrower
without defense, setoff or counterclaim, in immediately available funds and
delivered to Bank not later than 12:00 noon on the date due, at Bank's address
set forth in Section 9.1 hereof, or such other place as shall be designated in
writing by Bank. Funds received by Bank after that time shall be deemed to have
been paid on the next succeeding Business Day.

            2.3. Loan Fees. There shall be an initial fee for the Loan of Two
Hundred Thousand ($200,000) Dollars which shall be paid by the Borrower to the
Bank simultaneously with the execution of this Agreement. Simultaneously with
and as a condition to each extension, if any, of the Line Termination Date, the
Borrower shall pay to the Bank an extension fee of One Hundred Thousand
($100,000) Dollars. All loan fees shall be deemed fully earned when paid, shall
be non-refundable and shall not be subject to refund or rebate.

            2.4. Late Charge; Default Rate of Interest. Borrower shall pay Bank
a late charge of five percent (5%) of any payment of principal, interest, fees,
charges or Bank's Costs which is more than fifteen (15) days past due. In
addition, any principal payment on the Loan


                                       10
<PAGE>
not paid when due, and to the extent permitted by applicable law, any interest
payment on the Loan not paid when due, and any other amount due to Bank under
this Agreement or any other Loan Document not paid when due (including Bank's
Costs), in any case whether at stated maturity, demand, acceleration or
otherwise, shall thereafter bear interest payable upon demand at a rate per
annum equal to three percent (3%) plus the applicable Interest Rate on Advances
from time to time outstanding.

            2.5. Maximum Rate of Interest. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, no effective rate of interest
hereunder shall exceed the maximum effective rate of interest permitted by
applicable law or regulation. Borrower hereby agrees to give Bank written notice
in the event that Borrower has actual knowledge that any interest payment made
to Bank hereunder or under any other Loan Document will cause the total interest
payments collected in any one year to be usurious under applicable law, and Bank
hereby agrees not to knowingly collect any interest from Borrower in the form of
fees or otherwise which would render the Loan or the Note usurious. In the event
that interest hereunder or under any other Loan Document would be usurious in
the opinion of Bank, Bank reserves the right to reduce the interest payable by
Borrower. This Section shall survive closing and the repayment of the Loan.

            2.6. Obligations Absolute. The obligations of the Borrower under
this Agreement shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be
performed strictly in accordance with the terms hereof, under all circumstances
whatsoever, including without limitation the following circumstances: (i) any
lack of validity or enforceability of the Loan Documents or any other agreement
or document relating thereto; (ii) any amendment or waiver of or any consent to
or departure from the Loan Documents or any document relating thereto; (iii) the
existence of any claim, defense or other right which the Borrower may have at
any time against the Bank or any other person or entity, whether in connection
with this Agreement, the transactions described herein or any unrelated
transaction. Borrower understands and agrees that no payment by it under any
other agreement (whether voluntary or otherwise) shall constitute a defense to
its Obligations hereunder.

            2.7. Assessment. If Bank shall determine that (i) any current Rule,
the adoption or imposition of any Rule, any change in any Rule, or the adoption,
imposition or change in the interpretation or administration thereof by a
governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the
interpretation and administration thereof, or (ii) compliance with any guideline
or directive generally applicable to national banks whether or not having the
force of law, including without limitation with respect to special deposit,
capital adequacy, risk based capital, capital or reserve maintenance, capital
ratio, or similar requirements, or any deposits or other liabilities taken or
entered into by Bank (including the capital adequacy guidelines promulgated by
the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System) may result in (x) an
increase to Bank of the cost of making or maintaining the Loan, or to impose
upon Bank or increase any capital requirement applicable as a result of the
making or maintenance of the Loan, or (y) a reduction of the rate of return or
amounts receivable hereunder as a consequence of its obligations pursuant to
this Agreement to a level below that which Bank could have achieved but for such
adoption, imposition, change or compliance, taking into consideration Bank's
policies with respect to capital adequacy, (which adoption, imposition, change,
or increase in capital requirements or reduction in amounts receivable may be


                                       11
<PAGE>
determined by Bank's reasonable allocation of the aggregate of such cost
increase, capital increase or imposition or reductions in amounts receivable
resulting from such events), or (z) subjecting the Bank to any tax, duty, charge
or withholding on or from payments due from the Borrower (excluding federal
taxation of the overall net income of the Bank), or changes the basis of
taxation of payments to the Bank in respect of the Loan or other amounts due to
the Bank hereunder, then, from time to time, Borrower shall pay to Bank, within
ten (10) Business Days of demand by Bank, such additional amounts as will be
necessary to restore the rate of return to Bank from the date of such change,
together with interest on such amount from the tenth (10th) Business Day after
demand until payment thereof in full at highest Interest Rate on Advances from
time to time outstanding or if no Advances are outstanding, the higher of the
LIBOR Interest Rate or the Wall Street Prime Interest Rate. Bank shall be
entitled to compensation pursuant to this Section by submitting a certificate
claiming compensation and setting forth (accompanied by calculations in
reasonable detail) the increased cost, reduction in amounts receivable or
additional amount or amounts necessary to compensate Bank hereunder for any
reduction in return on capital, which certificate shall be conclusive absent
manifest error. Failure on the part of Bank to demand compensation for any
increased costs or reduction in amounts received or receivable or reduction in
return on capital with respect to any period shall not constitute a waiver of
Bank's right to demand compensation with respect to such period or any other
period. The protection of this Section shall be available to Bank regardless of
any possible contention of the invalidity or inapplicability of the Rule or
other change or condition which shall have occurred or been imposed.

statements and amendments to financing statements describing the Collateral in
any filing office as Bank, in its sole discretion may determine. Borrower agrees
to comply with the requirements of all state and federal laws and requests of
Bank in order for Bank to have and maintain a valid and perfected first security
interest in the Collateral.

                  3.3.2. In addition to the foregoing, Borrower shall do
anything further that may be reasonably required by Bank to secure Bank and
effectuate the intentions and objects of this Agreement, including, without
limitation, the execution and delivery of security agreements, contracts and any
other documents required hereunder. At Bank's request, Borrower shall also
immediately deliver (with execution by Borrower of all necessary documents or
forms


                                       12
<PAGE>
to reflect, implement or enforce the Liens described herein) to Bank all items

special, time or demand, provisional or final), accounts or monies at any time
held by the Bank in the Accounts and other indebtedness at any time owing by
Bank to or for the account of Borrower against any and all Indebtedness or other
obligations of Borrower, now or hereafter existing under this Agreement, the
Note or any other Loan Document, regardless of whether Bank shall have made any
demand hereunder or thereunder. Every such right of set-off shall be deemed to
have been exercised, immediately upon the occurrence of an Event of Default
without any action by Bank, although the Bank may enter such set-off on its
books and records at a later time.

            8.5. Singular or Multiple Exercise; Non-Waiver. The remedies
provided herein, in the Note and in the other Loan Documents or otherwise
available to Bank at law or in equity and any powers of attorney therein
contained, shall be cumulative and concurrent, and may be pursued singly,
successively or together at the sole discretion of Bank, and may be exercised as
often as occasion therefor shall occur; and the failure to exercise any such
right or remedy shall in no event be construed as a waiver or release of the
same.

            8.6. Discontinuance of Remedies. In the event that the Bank shall
have proceeded to enforce any right under this Agreement and such proceedings
shall have been discontinued or abandoned for any reason, then and in every such
case, the rights, remedies and obligations of the parties hereto shall remain in
full force and effect.

            8.7. Cumulative Remedies. No delay or omission of the Bank to
exercise any right or power arising under this Agreement, the Note or any other
Loan Document or from any Event of Default or Unmatured Event of Default shall
exhaust or impair any such right or power or prevent its exercise during the
occurrence of any other Event of Default or Unmatured Event


                                       25

of Default. No waiver by the Bank of any Event of Default, whether such waiver
be full or partial, shall extend to or be taken to effect any subsequent Event
of Default, or to impair the rights resulting therefrom except as may otherwise
be provided herein. The remedies provided in the Loan Documents are cumulative
and are not exclusive of any remedies provided by law.

            8.8. Cure. Nothing contained in this Loan Agreement, or any other
Loan Document shall be deemed to compel Bank to accept a cure of any Event of
Default hereunder.
