(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Indenture  Trustee agrees to deliver on the Closing Date to
the  Purchaser  and the Servicer an Initial  Certification  from the  Custodian
(to the extent  received by the Indenture  Trustee from the  Custodian).  Based
on its review  and  examination,  and only as to the  documents  identified  in
such  Initial  Certification,  the  Custodian,  pursuant  to the  terms  of the
Custodial  Agreement,  will  acknowledge  that such documents appear regular on
their face and relate to such  Loan.  Neither  the  Indenture  Trustee  nor the
Custodian  shall be under any duty or obligation to inspect,  review or examine
said  documents,  instruments,  certificates  or other papers to determine that
the  same  are  genuine,   enforceable,   recordable  or  appropriate  for  the
represented  purpose  or that  they have  actually  been  recorded  in the real
estate  records  or that they are other  than what they  purport to be on their
face; provided,  however,  that neither the Indenture Trustee nor the Custodian
shall make any  determination  as to whether (i) any  endorsement is sufficient
to  transfer  all  right,  title and  interest  of the party so  endorsing,  as
noteholder  or  assignee  thereof,  in and to that  Mortgage  Note or (ii)  any
assignment is in recordable  form or is sufficient to effect the  assignment of
and  transfer  to  the  assignee  thereof  under  the  mortgage  to  which  the
assignment  relates.  Not later  than 90 days  after  the  Closing  Date,  upon
receipt  of a  Final  Certification  from  the  Custodian  provided  for in the
Custodial  Agreement,  the Indenture  Trustee  shall deliver to the  Purchaser,
the  Seller and the  Servicer  such Final  Certification,  with any  applicable
exceptions noted thereon.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If, in the  course of such  review,  the  Indenture  Trustee is
notified  by the  Custodian  that any  document  constituting  a part of a Loan
File  does not  meet the  requirements  of  Exhibit  C  hereto,  the  Indenture
Trustee  shall cause the  Custodian  to list such as an  exception in the Final
Certification.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Seller shall  promptly  correct or cure such defect  within
90 days from the date it is so  notified  of such  defect  and,  if the  Seller
does not  correct or cure such  defect  within such  period,  the Seller  shall
either (i) substitute for the related Loan an Eligible  Substitute  Loan, which
substitution   shall  be   accomplished  in  the  manner  and  subject  to  the
conditions  set forth in Section  2(d),  or  (ii) purchase  such Loan within 90
days from the date the Seller  was  notified  of such  defect in writing at the
Repurchase Price of such Loan if such defect  materially and adversely  affects
the  value  of  the  related  Loan  or  interests  of  the  Noteholders  or the
Certificateholders;  provided,  however,  that  if the  cure,  substitution  or
repurchase  of a Loan  pursuant  to this  provision  is required by reason of a
delay in delivery of any documents by the appropriate  recording  office,  then
the Seller  shall be given 270 days from the  Closing  Date to cure such defect
or substitute  for, or repurchase  such Loan;  and further  provided,  that the
Seller shall have no liability  for  recording  any  Assignment  of Mortgage in
favor of the  Indenture  Trustee or for the  Servicer's  failure to record such
Assignment  of Mortgage,  and the Seller  shall not be obligated to  repurchase
or cure any Loan as to which such  Assignment of Mortgage is not recorded.  The
Indenture  Trustee  shall deliver  written  notice to each Rating Agency within
270 days from the  Closing  Date  indicating  each  Mortgage  (a) which has not
been returned by the appropriate  recording  office or (b) as to which there is
a dispute as to  location  or status of such  Mortgage.  Such  notice  shall be
delivered  every 90 days thereafter  until the related  Mortgage is returned to
the Custodian.  Any substitution  shall not be effected prior to the additional
delivery to the Indenture  Trustee or the  Custodian,  of a Request for Release
and the Loan File for any such Eligible  Substitute  Loan. The Repurchase Price
for any such Loan shall be  deposited  by the Seller in the Payment  Account on
or prior to the Business  Day  immediately  preceding  such Payment Date in the
month  following  the month of  repurchase  and,  upon receipt of such deposit,</FONT></P>

the Custodian,  pursuant to the terms of the Custodial Agreement,  will release
the  related  Loan File to the  Seller  and will  execute  and  deliver  at the
Seller's  request such  instruments  of transfer or assignment  prepared by the
Seller,  in each case  without  recourse,  representation  and  warranty  or as
shall be necessary to vest in the  Seller's,  or a its  designee,  the interest
of the Purchaser,  the Issuer,  and the Indenture  Trustee in any Loan released
pursuant  hereto.  It is  understood  and  agreed  that the  obligation  of the
Seller to cure,  substitute  for or to repurchase  any Loan which does not meet
the  requirements of this Section shall  constitute the sole remedy  respecting
such  defect  available  to  the  Indenture  Trustee,  the  Purchaser  and  any
Certificateholder against the Seller.</FONT></P>

parties  hereto  acknowledge  that the functions of the Indenture  Trustee with

pursuant to Sections 1 and 2 hereof  shall be performed  by the  Custodian.  In
connection  with the  assignment  of any Loan  registered  on the MERS(R)System,
the  Indenture  Trustee  shall cause,  at the  Servicer's  expense,  as soon as
practicable  after the Closing  Date,  the MERS(R)System to indicate  that such
Loans have been assigned by the Seller to the  Indenture  Trustee in accordance
with  this  Loan  Purchase  Agreement,   the  Owner  Trust  Agreement  and  the
Indenture for the benefit of the  Noteholders  by including  (or  deleting,  in
the case of Loans which are  repurchased in accordance  with this Agreement) in
such computer files (a) the code "[IDENTIFY  INDENTURE  TRUSTEE SPECIFIC CODE]"
in  the  field  "[IDENTIFY  THE  FIELD  NAME  FOR  INDENTURE   TRUSTEE]"  which
identifies the Indenture  Trustee and (b) the code  "[IDENTIFY  SERIES SPECIFIC
CODE  NUMBER]" in the field "Pool  Field"  which  identifies  the series of the
Notes issued in connection  with such Loans.  Indenture  Trustee agrees that it
will not alter the codes  referenced  in this  paragraph  with  respect  to any
Loan  during  the term of this Loan  Purchase  Agreement  unless and until such
Loan is  repurchased  in  accordance  with  the  terms  of this  Loan  Purchase
Agreement.</FONT></P>
