                         COMMON STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT

         THIS COMMON STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is entered into
as of December 26, 2002, by and between TAKARA BIO INC., a Japanese corporation
having its principal office at SETA 3-4-1, Otsu, Shiga, 520-2193 JAPAN
("Purchaser"), and LYNX THERAPEUTICS, INC., a Delaware corporation, having its
principal office at 25861 Industrial Blvd., Hayward, California, USA (the
"Company").

                                    RECITALS

         WHEREAS, Company and Purchaser have entered into that certain
Collaboration Agreement effective as of the 1st day of October, 2000, as amended
in that Amendment No. 1 to Collaboration Agreement, dated December 19, 2002 (the
"Collaboration Agreement"), for the right to use the Company's proprietary
technologies to manufacture, distribute and sell microarrays worldwide and to
provide Megasort(TM) and MPSS(TM) services to customers in Japan, China and
Korea;

         WHEREAS, the Company has authorized the sale and issuance of up to two
million forty thousand eight hundred sixteen (2,040,816) shares of its common
stock to Purchaser in a private placement; and

         WHEREAS, in connection with the Collaboration Agreement, the Company
desires to issue and sell such shares of its common stock to Purchaser, and
Purchaser desires to purchase such shares of Company's common stock on the terms
and conditions set forth in this Agreement.

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing recitals and the
following mutual promises and covenants, the parties hereto agree as follows:

                                    AGREEMENT

SECTION 1. SALE AND ISSUANCE OF STOCK

         1.1      SALE AND ISSUANCE OF COMMON STOCK. Subject to the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement and the Collaboration Agreement, on the
Closing Date (as defined below), the Company agrees to sell and issue to
Purchaser, and Purchaser agrees to purchase, the number of shares of the
Company's common stock (the "Shares") determined by dividing the applicable One
Million U.S. Dollars ($1,000,000) ("Purchase Price") by the current market price
per share of the Company's common stock. The "current market price per share"
shall be the average for ten (10) trading days immediately prior to December 26,
2002 of the average of the daily high and the daily low, as reported on the
Nasdaq National Market or other nationally-recognized primary market on which
the Company's common stock is traded.

         1.2      PAYMENT OF PURCHASE PRICE. The Purchase Price is payable by
Purchaser to the Company on the Closing Date by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account or

                                       1

<PAGE>

accounts to be designated by the Company, or by bank certified or cashier's
check made payable to the Company.

         1.3      TRANSFER TAXES. Any transfer taxes, stamp duties, filing fees,
registration fees, recordation expenses, escrow fees or other similar taxes,
fees, charges or expenses incurred by the Company, Purchaser or any other party
in connection with the purchase or in connection with any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be borne and paid exclusively
by the party incurring such expenses.

SECTION 2. CLOSING; DELIVERY.

         The consummation of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement (the
"Closing") shall be held on the date hereof ("Closing Date"). The Closing shall
be held at the offices of Cooley Godward LLP, 3175 Hanover Street, Palo Alto,
California 94306-2155 or at such other time or place as Purchaser and the
Company may mutually agree. At the Closing, the Company shall cause to be issued
to Purchaser a stock certificate, in the name of Purchaser, representing the
Shares being purchased against receipt of the payment of the Purchase Price. The
Company shall deliver such stock certificate to Purchaser at the Closing or
promptly thereafter.

SECTION 3. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF COMPANY.

         The Company hereby represents, warrants and covenants to Purchaser as
follows:

         3.1      ORGANIZATION, GOOD STANDING AND QUALIFICATION. The Company is
a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of the State of Delaware and has all requisite corporate power and
authority to carry on its business as now conducted and as presently proposed to
be conducted. The Company is duly qualified to transact business and is in good
standing as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction in which the failure to
so qualify would have a material adverse effect on its business or properties.

         3.2      AUTHORIZATION. All corporate action on the part of Company,
its officers, directors and stockholders necessary for the authorization,
execution and delivery of this Agreement, the performance of all obligations of
Company hereunder and the authorization, issuance and delivery of the Shares has
been taken or will be taken prior to the Closing, and this Agreement, when
executed and delivered will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of
the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms,
except as limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium, fraudulent conveyance and other laws of general application
affecting enforcement of creditors' rights generally, as limited by laws
relating to the availability of specific performance, injunctive relief or other
equitable remedies.

         3.3      VALID ISSUANCE OF COMMON STOCK. The Shares that are being
purchased by Purchaser hereunder, when issued, sold and delivered in accordance
with the terms hereof for the consideration expressed herein, will be duly and
validly authorized and issued, fully paid and nonassessable and free of
restrictions on transfer other than restrictions on transfer under this
Agreement and applicable state and federal securities laws.

                                       2

<PAGE>

         3.4      LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND ORDERS. There is no action, suit,
proceeding or investigation ("Legal Proceeding") pending or threatened against
the Company that questions the validity of this Agreement or the right of the
Company to enter into this Agreement or to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby, nor is the Company aware of any basis for any of the
forgoing. The Company is neither a party nor subject to the provisions of any
order, writ, injunction, judgment or decree of any court or government agency or
instrumentality that would affect the ability of the Company to enter into this
Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

SECTION 4. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PURCHASER

         Purchaser hereby represents, warrants and covenants to the Company as
follows:

         4.1      AUTHORIZATION. Purchase has full power and authority to enter
into this Agreement, and this Agreement, when executed and delivered, will
constitute valid and legally binding obligations of Purchaser, enforceable in
accordance with their terms, except as limited by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance and any other laws
of general application affecting enforcement of creditors' rights generally, and
as limited by laws relating to the availability of a specific performance,
injunctive relief or other equitable remedies.

         4.2      PURCHASE ENTIRELY FOR OWN ACCOUNT. This Agreement is made with
Purchaser in reliance upon Purchaser's representation to the Company, which by
Purchaser's execution of this Agreement Purchaser hereby confirms, that the
Shares to be purchased by Purchaser will be acquired for investment for
Purchaser's own account, not as a nominee or agent, and not with a view to the
resale or distribution of any part thereof. Purchaser has no present intention
of selling, granting any participation in or otherwise distributing the same. By
executing this Agreement, Purchaser further represents that Purchaser does not
presently have any contract, undertaking, agreement or arrangement with any
person to sell, transfer or grant participations to such person or to any third
person, with respect to any of the Shares and Purchaser has not been formed for
the specific purpose of acquiring the Shares.

         4.3      RECEIPT OF INFORMATION. Purchaser has had an opportunity to
discuss the Company's business, management and financial affairs and the terms
and conditions of the offering of the Shares with the Company's management and
has had an opportunity to review the Company's facilities. Purchaser has also
had an opportunity to ask questions of and receive answers from the Company
regarding the terms and conditions of its investment. Purchaser understands that
such discussions, as well as the written information issued by the Company, were
intended to describe the aspects of the Company's business which it believes to
be material.

         4.4      RESTRICTED SECURITIES. Purchaser understands that the Shares
have not been, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the "Securities Act"), by reason of a specific exemption from the
registration provisions of the Securities Act, which depends upon, among other
things, the bona fide nature of the investment intent and the accuracy of
Purchaser's representations as expressed herein. Purchaser understands that the
Shares are "restricted securities" under applicable U.S. federal and state
securities laws and that, pursuant to these laws, Purchaser must hold the Shares
indefinitely unless they are registered with the

                                       3

<PAGE>

Securities and Exchange Commission and qualified by state authorities, or an
exemption from such registration and qualification requirements is available.
Purchaser further acknowledges that if an exemption from registration or
qualification is available, it may be conditioned on various requirements
including, but not limited to, the time and manner of sale, the holding period
for the Shares, and on requirements relating to the Company which are outside of
Purchaser's control, and which the Company is under no obligation and may not be
able to satisfy.

         4.5      LEGENDS. Purchaser understands that the Shares and any
securities issued in respect of or exchange for the Shares, may bear one or all
of the following legends:

                  (a)      "THE SHARES REPRESENTED HEREBY HAVE NOT BEEN
REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, AND MAY NOT BE SOLD,
TRANSFERRED, ASSIGNED, PLEDGED OR HYPOTHECATED UNLESS AND UNTIL REGISTERED UNDER
SUCH ACT, OR UNLESS THE COMPANY HAS RECEIVED AN OPINION OF COUNSEL OR OTHER
EVIDENCE, SATISFACTORY TO THE COMPANY AND ITS COUNSEL, THAT SUCH REGISTRATION IS
NOT REQUIRED."

                  (b)      Any legend required by the Blue Sky laws of any state
to the extent such laws are applicable to the shares represented by the
certificate so legended.

         4.6      ACCREDITED INVESTOR. Purchaser is either (a) an accredited
investor as defined in Rule 501(a) of Regulation D promulgated under the Act or
(b) not an accredited investor and neither such Investor nor any beneficiary of
any trust or any investment client for whose account such Investor is purchasing
is a citizen or resident of the United States or Canada, or any state, territory
or possession thereof, including but not limited to any estate of any such
person, or any corporation, partnership, trust or other entity created or
existing under the laws thereof, or any entity controlled or owned by any of the
foregoing (a "U.S. Person").

         4.7      INVESTMENT EXPERIENCE. Purchaser is experienced in evaluating
and investing in private placement transactions of securities of companies in a
similar stage of development and acknowledges that Purchaser is able to fend for
himself, herself or itself, can bear the economic risk of such investment and
has such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters that
Purchaser is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of the investment in the
Shares.

         4.8      FURTHER REPRESENTATION BY FOREIGN INVESTORS. If Purchaser is
not a U.S. Person, Purchaser hereby represents that Purchaser is satisfied as to
the full observance of the laws of Purchaser's jurisdiction in connection with
any invitation to subscribe for the Shares or any use of this Agreement,
including (i) the legal requirements of Purchaser's jurisdiction for the
purchase of the Shares, (ii) any foreign exchange restrictions applicable to
such purchase, (iii) any governmental or other consents that may need to be
obtained and (iv) the income tax and other tax consequences, if any, which may
be relevant to the purchase, holding, redemption, sale or transfer of the
Shares. Purchaser's subscription and payment for, and Purchaser's continued
beneficial ownership of, the Shares will not violate any applicable securities
or other laws of Purchaser's jurisdiction.
