("Employee").

     In  consideration  for the  Company's  continued  employment  of  Employee,
Employee's  continued  employment with the Company,  and other good and valuable
consideration,  the parties hereby mutually agree to amend and supplement  their
original August 1, 2000 Employment  Agreement  ("Agreement") and their Amendment
to Employment Agreement dated May 8, 2001 ("First Amendment"),  in the following
manner:

Paragraph 3 of the Agreement and First Amendment are hereby amended as follows:

(a)    Base Salary. For all services rendered by Employee during the Term of the
Agreement  (as defined in paragraph I of the  Agreement),  the Company shall pay
Employee a minimum  annual base  salary of One  Hundred and Sixty Five  Thousand
Dollars  ($165,000.00),   payable  in  equal  semi-monthly  installments,   less
applicable withholdings.

(c)    Retention Bonus.

     (1) In  recognition  of  Employee's  past service with the Company,  and to
incentivize  Employee to enter into this Second  Amendment  the Company will pay
Employee a lump-sum payment equaling thirty thousand dollars ($30,000.00),  less
applicable  withholdings,  to be paid on the  next  pay  period  after  Employee
executes this Second Amendment.

     (2) If Employee is employed by the Company through June 30, 2003,  Employee
will  receive  a  lump-sum   payment  equaling   twenty-five   thousand  dollars
($25,000.00),  less  applicable  withholdings,  to be  paid by  July  31,  2003.
Employee  agrees she is not entitled to this payment if, prior to June 30, 2003,
Employee  ceases or terminates  employment with the Company other than for "Good
Reason" as defined in paragraph 4(c) of the  Agreement,  or if she is terminated
for "Cause" as defined in paragraph 4(a) of the Agreement.

     (3) If  Employee  is  employed  by the  Company  through  January  1, 2004,
Employee will receive a lump-sum payment equaling  twenty-five  thousand dollars
($25,000.00),  less  applicable  withholdings,  to be paid by January 31,  2004.
Employee  agrees she is not  entitled to this  payment  if,  prior to January 1,
2004,  Employee ceases or terminates  employment with the Company other than for
"Good  Reason" as  defined  in  paragraph  4(c) of the  Agreement,  or if she is
terminated for "Cause" as defined in paragraph 4(a) of the Agreement.

Paragraph 10 of the Agreement is hereby amended as follows:

10.    Entire Agreement/Supersede First Amendment. This Second Amendment and the
Agreement  set forth the entire  understanding  and agreement of the Company and

this Second Amendment.  No modification of or amendment to this Second Amendment
or the Agreement shall be binding upon the Company or Employee unless in writing
