Scott Montross
National Steel Corporation
4100 Edison Lakes Parkway
Mishawaka, Indiana 46545

Dear Mr. Montross:

National Steel Corporation ("Company") and you ("Employee") are currently
parties to a letter agreement dated as of February 11, 2002 (the "Original
Agreement"). The parties now wish to amend and restate the Original Agreement in
its entirety. Therefore, the parties hereby agree as follows:

(1)  When used herein, the following capitalized terms shall have the meanings
set forth below:

     (a)  "Cause" shall mean (i) Employee is convicted of a felony, (ii) in the
     reasonable determination of the Company, Employee has (x) committed an act
     of fraud, embezzlement or theft in connection with Employee's duties in the
     course of Employee's employment with the Company, (y) caused intentional
     damage or harm to the property, business or reputation of the Company, or
     (z) intentionally disclosed Confidential Information (as hereinafter
     defined) in breach of this Agreement, or (iii) Employee has otherwise
     materially breached Employee's obligations under this Agreement and shall
     not have remedied such breach within 15 days after receiving written notice
     from the Company specifying the details thereof. For purposes of this
     Agreement, an act or omission on the part of Employee shall be deemed
     "intentional" only if it was not due primarily to an error in judgment or
     negligence and was done by Employee not in good faith and without
     reasonable belief that the act or omission was in the best interest of the
     Company.

     (b)  "Termination Event" shall mean (i) termination of Employee's
     employment with the Company, within two years following the closing of a
     Transaction, either (a) by Employee following a reduction of Employee's
     base salary from the base salary then in effect, (b) by Employee following
     a reduction or diminution of Employee's duties or responsibilities without
     Employee's prior written consent, or (c) by Company other than for Cause;
     or (ii) termination of this Agreement by the Company in accordance with
     Section (4) hereof.

     (c)  "Termination Date" shall mean the date on which a Termination Event
     occurs.

     (d)  "Transaction" shall mean any transaction pursuant to which any third
     party acquires a majority of the stock or assets of the Company, including
     any such transaction

<PAGE>

     pursuant to which the Company is merged into a wholly owned subsidiary of
     such third party.

(2)  If a Termination Event occurs, the Company shall:

     (a)  pay to Employee any unused vacation pay, in accordance with the
     Company's standard policies and practices;

     (b)  reimburse Employee, in accordance with the Company's standard expense
     reimbursement policy, for any reasonable expenses incurred by Employee
     prior to the Termination Date that have not theretofore been reimbursed;

     (c)  pay to Employee a single sum payment in cash, within 30 days after the
     Termination Date, in an amount equal to Employee's annual base salary as in
     effect immediately prior to the Termination Date;

     (d)  pay to Employee a single sum payment in cash, within 30 days after the
     Termination Date, in an amount equal to Employee's target bonus percentage
     pursuant to the Company's Key Management Incentive Compensation Plan, or
     any successor plan thereto, multiplied by the Employee's annual base salary
     as in effect immediately prior the Termination Date; and

     (e)  provide continued participation for Employee and Employee's eligible
     dependents in the Company sponsored health care plan, in which Employee
     participated immediately prior to the Termination Date, for a period of 12
     months following the Termination Date, provided that such participation
     shall in any case cease if Employee becomes covered under a group health
     care plan sponsored by another employer. If the Company sponsored health
     care plan does not by its terms allow participation or continued
     participation by Employee or Employee's eligible dependents, the Company
     shall obtain and pay all premiums for insurance coverage on behalf of
     Employee and/or Employee's eligible dependents that provides equivalent
     benefits as provided under such Company sponsored health care plan or, at
     the Company's election, shall provide such benefits from its own assets.

     (f)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
     Employee shall not be entitled to any of the payments or benefits described
     in Sections (2)(c) - (2)(e) unless Employee executes a written release upon
     the Termination Date, substantially in the form attached hereto as Annex 1
     (the "Release"), of any and all claims against the Company and all related
     parties with respect to all matters arising out of Employee's employment by
     the Company (other than any entitlements under the terms of this Agreement
     or under any other plans or programs of the Company in which Employee
     participated and under which Employer has accrued a benefit), or the
     termination thereof.

(3)  In consideration of the agreements of the Company set forth in Section (2)
above, Employee hereby agrees as follows:

     (a)  Employee recognizes and acknowledges that by reason of Employee's
     employment by and service to the Company during and, if applicable, after
     the Termination Date, Employee will continue to have access to certain
     confidential and proprietary information relating to the business of the
     Company, which may include, but is not limited to, trade secrets, trade
     "know-how," customer information, supplier

                                        2

<PAGE>

     information, cost and pricing information, marketing and sales techniques,
     strategies and programs, manufacturing processes and equipment, computer
     programs and software and financial information (collectively referred to
     as "Confidential Information"). Employee acknowledges that such
     Confidential Information is a valuable and unique asset of the Company and
     Employee covenants that Employee will not, unless expressly authorized in
     writing by the Company's President or Chief Executive Officer, at any time
     during the course of Employee's employment use any Confidential Information
     or divulge or disclose any Confidential Information to any person, firm or
     corporation except in connection with the performance of Employee's duties
     for the Company and in a manner consistent with the Company's policies
     regarding Confidential Information. Employee also covenants that at any
     time after the Termination Date, Employee will not use any Confidential
     Information or divulge or disclose any Confidential Information to any
     person, firm or corporation, unless such information is in the public
     domain through no fault of Employee or except when required to do so by a
     court of law, by any governmental agency having supervisory authority over
     the business of the Company or by any administrative or legislative body
     (including a committee thereof) with apparent jurisdiction to order
     Employee to divulge, disclose or make accessible such information, in which
     case Employee will inform the Company in writing promptly of such required
     disclosure, but in any event at least two business days prior to
     disclosure. All written Confidential Information (including, without
     limitation, in any computer or other electronic format) which comes into
     Employee's possession during the course of Employee's employment shall
     remain the property of the Company. Except as required in the performance
     of Employee's duties for the Company, or unless expressly authorized in
     writing by the Company's President or Chief Executive Officer, Employee
     shall not remove any written Confidential Information from the Company's
     premises, except in connection with the performance of Employee's duties
     for the Company and in a manner consistent with the Company's policies
     regarding Confidential Information. Upon termination of Employee's
     employment, Employee agrees immediately to return to the Company all
     written Confidential Information in Employee's possession.

     (b)  During Employee's employment by the Company and for a period of three
     months after the Termination Date, within the "Geographic Area," as defined
     below, Employee will not, except with the prior written consent of the
     Company's President or Chief Executive Officer, directly or indirectly,
     own, manage, operate, join, control, finance or participate in the
     ownership, management, operation, control or financing of, or be connected
     as an officer, director, employee, partner, principal, agent,
     representative, consultant or otherwise with, or use or permit Employee's
     name to be used in connection with, any business or enterprise which is
     engaged in making, producing, manufacturing or finishing steel products
     that are in direct competition with steel products made, produced,
     manufactured or finished by the Company. For the purposes of this Section,
     "Geographic Area" shall mean the continental United States; provided,
     however, that if any court of competent jurisdiction determines that the
     Geographic Area is too extensive to require enforcement of this Subsection
     3(b), the Geographic Area shall be the portion of the United States east of
     the Mississippi River (or the largest other such portion of the United
     States that such court deems not too extensive to require enforcement of
     this Subsection 3(b)). The foregoing restrictions shall not be construed to
     prohibit the ownership by Employee of less than one percent (1%) of any
     class of securities of any corporation which is engaged in any of the
     foregoing businesses having a class of securities registered pursuant to
     the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, provided that such ownership
     represents a passive investment and that neither Employee nor any group of
     persons including Employee in any way, either directly or indirectly,
     manages or

                                        3

<PAGE>

     exercises control of any such corporation, guarantees any of its financial
     obligations, otherwise takes any part in its business, other than
     exercising Employee's rights as a shareholder, or seeks to do any of the
     foregoing.

     (c)  Employee further covenants and agrees that during Employee's
     employment by the Company and for the period of one year after the
     Termination Date, Employee will not, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit,
     divert, take away, or attempt to solicit, divert or take away, any of the
     Company's customers, or (ii) encourage any customer to reduce its patronage
     of the Company.

     (d)  Employee further covenants and agrees that during Employee's
     employment by the Company and for the period of one year after the
     Termination Date, Employee will not, except with the prior written consent
     of the Company's President or Chief Executive Officer, directly or
     indirectly, solicit or hire, or encourage the solicitation or hiring of,
     any person who was a managerial or higher level employee of the Company at
     any time during the term of Employee's employment by the Company by any
     employer other than the Company for any position as an employee,
     independent contractor, consultant or otherwise. The foregoing covenant of
     Employee shall not apply to any person after 12 months have elapsed
     subsequent to the date on which such person's employment by the Company has
     terminated.

     (e)  During the Term and subsequent to the Termination Date, Employee
     agrees not to make any negative or unfavorable statements or
     communications, and not to issue any written communications or release any
     other written materials which would be materially damaging to the Company,
     its officers, directors or affiliates, or its or their reputation or
     standing, whether in the investor or financial community, the steel
     industry or otherwise.

     (f)  Employee agrees to cooperate with the Company for a reasonable period
     of time after the Termination Date by making himself available to testify
     on behalf of the Company, in any action, suit or proceeding. In addition,
     for a reasonable period of time after the Termination Date, Employee agrees
     to be available at reasonable times to meet and consult with the Company on
     matters reasonably within the scope of his prior duties with the Company so
     as to facilitate a transition to his successor. The Company agrees to
     compensate Employee for any such services at the rate of base salary
     applicable to Employee immediately prior to the Termination Date and to
     reimburse Employee for all expenses actually incurred in connection with
     his provision of testimony or consulting assistance.

     (g)  Employee acknowledges and agrees that the restrictions contained in
     this Section 3 are reasonable and necessary to protect and preserve the
     legitimate interests, properties, goodwill and business of the Company,
     that the Company would not have entered into this Agreement in the absence
     of such restrictions and that irreparable injury will be suffered by the
     Company should Employee breach any of the provisions of this Section.
     Employee represents and acknowledges that (i) Employee has been advised by
     the Company to consult Employee's own legal counsel in respect of this
     Agreement, and (ii) that Employee has had full opportunity, prior to
     execution of this Agreement, to review thoroughly this Agreement with
     Employee's counsel.

     (h)  Employee further acknowledges and agrees that a breach of any of the
     restrictions in this Section (3) cannot be adequately compensated by
     monetary damages. Employee agrees that the Company shall be entitled to
     preliminary and permanent

                                        4

<PAGE>

     injunctive relief, without the necessity of proving actual damages, as well
     as an equitable accounting of all earnings, profits and other benefits
     arising from any violation of Section (3) hereof, which rights shall be
     cumulative and in addition to any other rights or remedies to which the
     Company may be entitled. In the event that any of the provisions of Section
     (3) hereof should ever be adjudicated to exceed the time, geographic,
     service, or other limitations permitted by applicable law in any
     jurisdiction, it is the intention of the parties that the provision shall
     be amended to the extent of the maximum time, geographic, service, or other
     limitations permitted by applicable law, that such amendment shall apply
     only within the jurisdiction of the court that made such adjudication and
     that the provision otherwise be enforced to the maximum extent permitted by
     law.

     (i)  If Employee breaches any of Employee's obligations under Section (3)
     hereof, and such breach constitutes Cause, or would constitute Cause if it
     had occurred prior to the Termination Date, the Company shall thereafter
     remain obligated only for such compensation and other benefits, if any, as
     may otherwise be required in any plans, policies or practices then
     applicable to Employee in accordance with the terms thereof, and not for
     any compensation or other benefits under this Agreement.

     (j)  Employee irrevocably and unconditionally (i) agrees that any suit,
     action or other legal proceeding arising out of Section (3) hereof,
     including without limitation, any action commenced by the Company for
     preliminary and permanent injunctive relief and other equitable relief, may
     be brought in the United States District Court for the Northern District of
     Indiana, or if such court does not have jurisdiction or will not accept
     jurisdiction, in any court of general jurisdiction in Indiana, (ii)
     consents to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of any such court in any such
     suit, action or proceeding, and (iii) waives any objection which Employee
     may have to the laying of venue of any such suit, action or proceeding in
     any such court.

(4)  The term of this Agreement shall commence as of the date hereof and shall
continue thereafter for successive one year periods, unless sooner terminated by
written notice given by either party not less than 60 days prior to January 24,
2004, or any subsequent January 24; provided, however, that the respective
rights and obligations of the parties under this Agreement shall survive any
termination of this Agreement or of Employee's employment to the extent
necessary to the intended preservation of such rights and obligations.

(5)  In the event of any dispute under the provisions of this Agreement other
than a dispute in which the primary relief sought is an equitable remedy such as
an injunction, the parties shall be required to have the dispute, controversy or
claim settled by arbitration in Mishawaka, Indiana, in accordance with National
Rules for the Resolution of Employment Disputes then in effect of the American
Arbitration Association, before a panel of three arbitrators, two of whom shall
be selected by the Company and Employee, respectively, and the third of whom
shall be selected by the other two arbitrators. Any award entered by the
arbitrators shall be in writing and accompanied by a written finding of facts.
Such award shall be final, binding and nonappealable, and judgment may be
entered thereon by either party in accordance with applicable law in any court
of competent jurisdiction. This arbitration provision shall be specifically
enforceable. The arbitrators shall have no authority to modify any provision of
this Agreement or to award a remedy for a dispute involving this Agreement other
than a benefit specifically provided under or by virtue of the Agreement. If
Employee prevails on any material issue which is the subject of such arbitration
or lawsuit, the Company shall be responsible for all of the fees of the American
Arbitration Association and the arbitrators and any expenses relating to the
conduct of the

                                        5

<PAGE>

arbitration (including the Company's and Employee's reasonable attorneys' fees
and expenses). Otherwise, each party shall be responsible for its own expenses
relating to the conduct of the arbitration (including reasonable attorneys' fees
and expenses) and shall share the fees of the American Arbitration Association.

(6)  All notices and other communications required or permitted under this
Agreement or necessary or convenient in connection herewith shall be in writing
and shall be deemed to have been given when hand delivered or mailed by
registered or certified mail, as follows (provided that notice of change of
address shall be deemed given only when received):

or to such other names or addresses as the Company or Employee, as the case may
be, shall designate by notice to each other person entitled to receive notices
in the manner specified in this Section.

(7)  This Agreement amends and restates the Original Agreement and sets forth
the entire understanding between the parties hereto with respect to the subject
matter hereof and cannot be changed, modified, extended or terminated except
upon written amendment executed by the Company and by Employee.

(8)  All of the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the respective heirs, executors,
administrators, legal representatives, successors and assigns of the parties
hereto, except that the duties and responsibilities of Employee under this
Agreement are of a personal nature and shall not be assignable or delegatable in
whole or in part by Employee.

(9)  If any provision of this Agreement or application thereof to anyone or
under any circumstances is adjudicated to be invalid or unenforceable in any
jurisdiction, such invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect any other
provision or application of this Agreement which can be given effect without the
invalid or unenforceable provision or application and shall not invalidate or
render unenforceable such provision or application in any other jurisdiction. If
any provision is held void, invalid or unenforceable with respect to particular
circumstances, it shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect in all
other circumstances.

(10) No remedy conferred upon a party by this Agreement is intended to be
exclusive of any other remedy, and each and every such remedy shall be
cumulative and shall be in addition to any other remedy given under this
Agreement or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity. No delay or omission
by a party in exercising any right, remedy or power under this Agreement or
existing at law or in equity shall be construed as a waiver thereof, and any
such right, remedy or

                                        6

<PAGE>

power may be exercised by such party from time to time and as often as may be
deemed expedient or necessary by such party in its sole discretion.

(11) Employee shall be entitled, to the extent permitted under any applicable
law, to select and change a beneficiary or beneficiaries to receive any
compensation or benefit payable under this Agreement following Employee's death
by giving the Company written notice thereof. In the event of Employee's death
or a judicial determination of Employee's incompetence, reference in this
Agreement to Employee shall be deemed, where appropriate, to refer to Employee's
beneficiary, estate or other legal representative.

(12) All section headings used in this Agreement are for convenience only. This
Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which is an original. It
shall not be necessary in making proof of this Agreement or any counterpart
hereof to produce or account for any of the other counterparts.

(13) The Company may withhold from any payments under this Agreement all
federal, state and local taxes as the Company is required to withhold pursuant
to any law or governmental rule or regulation. Employee shall bear all expense
of, and be solely responsible for, all federal, state and local taxes due with
respect to any payment received under this Agreement.

(14) This Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted under the laws of the
State of Indiana without giving effect to any conflict of laws provisions.

If the terms of this letter are acceptable to you, please so indicate by signing
in the space provided below, whereupon this letter shall constitute an agreement
between us.

Sincerely,
