         of and approves such material waiver or delay in its sole discretion),

         respect since the date of execution thereof except to the extent such
         amendment or modification is expressly set forth in the Confirmation
         Order and is satisfactory to the Administrative Agent in its sole
         discretion;

                  (ii) the principal amount outstanding under the DIP Loan
         Agreement (as defined in the APA), which amount is required to be
         retired by the Borrower pursuant to Section 3.1(i)(b) of the APA, shall
         not exceed $84,100,000, provided that the parties agree that such
         maximum principal amount shall not include (x) any interest due and

         Loan Agreement, even if classified as additional principal as a result

                  (iii) the portion of the purchase price defined as "Additional
         Consideration" in the APA shall not be paid by the Borrower or any

         Outstanding Amount of all Revolving Loans, Swing Line Loans and L/C
         Obligations by not less than $20,000,000, and (B) no Default or Event
         of Default exists, either before or after the making of such payment;

                  (iv) the Confirmation Order approving the Plan and the APA has
         been entered as a Final Order (as defined in the APA), and demonstrates
         that the assets acquired in the Proposed Acquisition are acquired by
         the Borrower and/or its Subsidiaries free and clear of all Liens (other
         than those Liens defined as "Permitted Liens" in the APA); and

                  (v) the Borrower has delivered to the Administrative Agent a
         copy of the Confirmation Order together with a certificate of the
         Secretary or Assistant Secretary of the Borrower stating that (A) such
         copy of the Confirmation Order is a true and correct copy, (B) such
         Confirmation Order is a Final Order and satisfies the condition
         precedent set forth in Section 4.3.2 of the APA, and (C) all conditions
         precedent to the effectiveness of the APA and the Plan have been
         satisfied in full without waiver or delay thereof in any material
         respect, unless the Administrative Agent has approved such material
         waiver or delay in its sole discretion.

So long as the conditions set forth in this Paragraph 2(a) are and continue to
be satisfied, the Proposed Acquisition shall be disregarded in calculating the
dollar limitations on Acquisitions provided in Section 7.14 of the Credit
Agreement. In the event that any of the conditions to the waiver and consent
contained in this Paragraph 2(a) is violated or otherwise fails, whether
occurring at or after the consummation of the Proposed Acquisition, then an
Event of Default shall be deemed to have immediately occurred under the Credit
Agreement, notwithstanding any other waiver or consent to the Proposed
Acquisition given by the Lenders prior to the date of this Agreement.

satisfied within 10 Business Days of the Administrative Agent's receipt of such
notice, and any provisions of any other Loan Documents waived by this Paragraph
2(b) shall become immediately effective and shall be satisfied within 10
Business Days of the Administrative Agent's receipt of such notice.

         (c) In the event that the Borrower or one of its Subsidiaries issues
Equity Securities that would give rise to a prepayment obligation pursuant to
Section 2.06(e)(ii) of the Credit Agreement, the Administrative Agent and the
Lenders hereby consent to the Borrower excluding from the calculation of Net
Proceeds therefrom, on a one-time basis, (A) that portion of the proceeds from
such issuance of Equity Securities used to pay the Additional Consideration (as
defined in the APA), not to exceed $6,000,000 in the aggregate, and (B) an
additional amount from the proceeds of such issuance of Equity Securities of up
to $5,000,000 (the total amount so to be excluded, including the Additional
Consideration and the additional amount up to $5,000,000, is referred to herein
as the "Permitted Excluded Amount"), provided that:

                  (i) not later than 10 Business Days after the receipt of
         proceeds from the issuance of Equity Securities, the Borrower gives
         written notice to the Administrative Agent of its intent to use a
         portion of such proceeds (not to exceed $6,000,000) to pay the
         Additional Consideration and of its intent to exclude from the
         calculation of Net Proceeds the Permitted Excluded Amount, which notice
         may be included in and delivered with the calculation of Net Proceeds
         required to be delivered pursuant to Section 2.06(e)(ii), and which
         notice will include the calculation of the amount of the Permitted
         Excluded Amount, which may not exceed the amount used to pay the
         Additional Consideration in cash (up to $6,000,000) plus $5,000,000;

                  (ii) the Borrower is entitled at such time to make the payment
         of Additional Consideration in cash pursuant to Paragraph 2(a)(iii) of
         this Agreement;


                                       7
<PAGE>


                  (iii) not later than the last day on which the payment of the
         Additional Consideration may be made pursuant to the terms of the APA,
         the Borrower makes the payment of Additional Consideration in cash; and

                  (iv) at all times from the date of such Equity Issuance until
         the proceeds are used to make the payment of Additional Consideration,
         no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing.

The condition in Paragraph 2(c)(i) above must be satisfied in order for any of
the Permitted Excluded Amount to be excluded from the calculation of Net
Proceeds in calculating the prepayment required by Section 2.06(e)(ii) of the
Credit Agreement. In the event that one of the conditions in Paragraphs
2(c)(ii), (iii) and (iv) above fails after the Borrower has made a prepayment
required by Section 2.06(e)(ii) of the Credit Agreement and excluded the
Permitted Excluded Amount from the Net Proceeds in calculating such prepayment,
the Borrower shall give prompt written notice thereof, and in any case within 10
Business Days of the failure of any such condition, to the Administrative Agent,
which notice shall include a calculation of the amount of the prepayment avoided
by the earlier exclusion from the calculation of Net Proceeds of the amount to
be used to pay the Additional Consideration (but not the additional amount up to
$5,000,000), and such notice shall be accompanied by the payment of such
previously avoided prepayment set forth in such notice.

         (d) In the event that the Borrower, directly or through one or more
Subsidiaries, at any time Disposes of any or all of the Assumed Owned Real
Property, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders hereby consent, so long as no
Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing at the time of such
Disposition, to the Borrower excluding from the prepayment requirements of
Section 2.06(e)(iii) up to an aggregate amount of $500,000 of Net Proceeds from
all such Dispositions.

         (e) With respect to assets acquired by the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries pursuant to the Proposed Acquisition, to the extent that the Credit
Agreement and the other Loan Documents require that prior notice be given of the
location of tangible assets of the Borrower or any Subsidiary, of trade names,
trademarks or other trade styles, and/or similar information, including without
limitation the requirements of Section 2A.03 of the Credit Agreement and
Sections 7(f), 7(h), 7(i), 9(e)(iii), 9(f)(iii) and 9(j) of the Security
Agreement, the Borrower shall not be required to give the Administrative Agent
such notice until the date that is 30 days after the consummation of the
Proposed Acquisition.

         (f) The parties hereto agree that, so long as accomplished in
compliance with the terms of the Intropack Agreement, the acquisition of
intellectual property pursuant to the Intropack Agreement by Tilia
International, Inc., and the related transactions contemplated by the Intropack
Agreement, shall not constitute an "Acquisition" under the Credit Agreement.

         (g) The parties hereto agree that, with respect to any patent, patent
application, trademark, trademark application, copyright registration or
copyright application acquired prior to the effective date of this Agreement
pursuant to the Intropack Agreement (the "Intropack IP"), the requirements of
the IP Security Agreement that relate to a Grantor (as defined in the IP
Security Agreement) giving notice of the acquisition of such newly acquired
intellectual



                                       8

property, taking perfection action with respect thereto, and/or delivering
revised Schedules I, II and III with respect thereto, and related requirements,
including without limitation Sections 5 and 20 of the IP Security Agreement, the
Borrower and its applicable Subsidiaries shall have 30 days after the date of
this Agreement to deliver such notices and schedules and to take such perfection
action.

         3. Effectiveness; Conditions Precedent. The effectiveness of this
Agreement, and the amendments to the Credit Agreement provided in Paragraph 1

         expenses).

         4. Advance of the Term Loan.

         (a) Attached as Exhibit C hereto is the additional commitment of each
Lender providing for an increase in the aggregate amount of $10,000,000 of the
existing principal amount of the Term Loan, as permitted in the definitions of
"Term Loan" and "Term Loan Facility" in the Credit Agreement, as such terms are
amended by Paragraph 1 of this Agreement.

         (b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including
the satisfaction of the conditions precedent to the effectiveness of this
Agreement contained in Paragraph 3 hereof and the conditions to the consent and
waiver with respect to the Proposed Acquisition found in Paragraphs 2(a)(i),
(ii), (iv) and (v) hereof, each Lender committing to an increased amount of the
Term Loan severally agrees to make an advance of its share of the increase in
the Term Loan, as set forth on Exhibit C hereto, in Dollars to the Borrower, at
the time set forth in Paragraph 4(c) below.

         (c) The advance of the increase in the Term Loan shall be made upon the
Borrower giving written notice (the "Advance Notice") to the Administrative
Agent that the conditions to the consent to the Proposed Acquisition in
Paragraph 2 hereof have been satisfied (the date of the delivery of the Advance
Notice is referred to herein as the "Advance Notice Date"), which Advance Notice
shall be given not later than the latest of (x) 1:00 P.M. the day after the
consummation of the APA and (y) 1:00 P.M. the day after the Confirmation Order
becomes a Final Order. In the event that the Administrative Agent has received
the Advance Notice not later than 12:00 Noon New York time on the Advance Notice
Date, the Administrative Agent shall immediately give each Lender committing to
an increased amount of the Term Loan notice of the receipt of the Advance
Notice, and each such Lender shall make the amount of its advance as set forth
on Exhibit C hereto available by wire transfer to the Administrative Agent
within one hour of receipt of such notice from the Administrative Agent;
provided that if the Advance Notice is received by the Administrative Agent
after 12:00 Noon on the Advance Notice Date, each Lender shall make its advance
amount available by wire transfer no later than 10:00 A.M. the next morning.
Such wire transfer shall be directed to the Administrative Agent at the
Administrative Agent's Office and shall be in the form of Same Day Funds in
Dollars. The amount so received by the Administrative Agent shall, subject to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, be made available to the Borrower by
delivery of the proceeds thereof as shall be directed in writing by the
Responsible Officer of the Borrower and reasonably acceptable to the
Administrative Agent. The initial Borrowing of the increased amount of the Term
Loan shall be a single Base Rate Segment, subject to Conversion after the
Advance Notice Date in accordance



                                       10
<PAGE>


with a Term Loan Interest Rate Selection Notice delivered on the Advance Notice
Date pursuant to Section 4.01(a) of the Credit Agreement (or, if a Term Loan
Interest Rate Selection Notice is not delivered on the Advance Notice Date,
thereafter in accordance with Section 2.03 of the Credit Agreement).

         (d) The parties hereto agree that upon being advanced, the additional
amounts shall be part of the "Term Loan" and the "Term Loan Facility" under the
Credit Agreement, without regard to any effect the advance thereof after the
Closing Date might otherwise have on the terms or interpretation of the
provisions of the Credit Agreement.

         5. Consent of the Guarantors. Each Guarantor hereby consents,
acknowledges and agrees to the amendments, consents and waivers set forth herein
and hereby confirms and ratifies in all respects the Guaranty to which such
Guarantor is a party (including without limitation the continuation of such
Guarantor's payment and performance obligations thereunder upon and after the
effectiveness of this Agreement and the amendments, waivers and consents
contemplated hereby) and the enforceability of such Guaranty against such
Guarantor in accordance with its terms.

         6. Representations and Warranties. In order to induce the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders to enter into this Agreement, the Borrower
represents and warrants to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders as follows:

                  (a) The representations and warranties made by the Borrower in
         Article V of the Credit Agreement and in each of the other Loan
         Documents to which it is a party are true and correct in all material
         respects on and as of the date hereof, including after giving effect to
         the Proposed Acquisition, except (i) to the extent that such
         representations and warranties expressly relate to an earlier date, and
         (ii) the representations and warranties contained in the IP Security
         Agreement that refer to Schedule I, II or III to the IP Security
         Agreement related to such schedules without giving effect to the
         acquisition of any of the Intropack IP;

                  (b) Since the date of the most recent financial reports of the
         Borrower delivered pursuant to Section 4.01(a)(ix) or Section 6.01 of
         the Credit Agreement, as applicable, no act, event, condition or
         circumstance has occurred or arisen which, singly or in the aggregate
         with one or more other acts, events, occurrences or conditions
         (whenever occurring or arising), has had or could reasonably be
         expected to have a Material Adverse Effect;

                  (c) The Persons appearing as Guarantors on the signature pages
         to this Agreement constitute all Persons who are required to be
         Guarantors pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement and the other
         Loan Documents, including without limitation all Persons who became

         Closing Date, and each of such Persons has become and remains a party
         to a Guaranty as a Guarantor;

                  (d) This Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and
         delivered by the Borrower and Guarantors party hereto and constitutes a
         legal, valid and binding



                                       11

         obligation of such parties, except as may be limited by general
         principles of equity or by the effect of any applicable bankruptcy,

         creditors' rights generally; and

                  (e) After giving effect to this Agreement, no Default or Event
         of Default has occurred and is continuing.

         7. Entire Agreement. This Agreement, together with all the Loan
Documents (collectively, the "Relevant Documents"), sets forth the entire
understanding and agreement of the parties hereto in relation to the subject
matter hereof and supersedes any prior negotiations and agreements among the

or warranty, express or implied, not set forth in the Relevant Documents shall
bind any party hereto, and no such party has relied on any such promise,
condition, representation or warranty. Each of the parties hereto acknowledges

         9. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original as against any party
whose signature appears thereon, and all of which shall together constitute one
and the same instrument.

         10. Governing Law. This Agreement shall in all respects be governed by,
and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York applicable

be further subject to the provisions of Sections 10.16(b) and 10.17 of the
Credit Agreement.

         11. Enforceability. Should any one or more of the provisions of this
Agreement be determined to be illegal or unenforceable as to one or more of the
parties hereto, all other provisions nevertheless shall remain effective and
binding on the parties hereto.

         12. References. All references in any of the Loan Documents to the
"Credit Agreement" shall mean the Credit Agreement, as amended hereby.

         13. Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
