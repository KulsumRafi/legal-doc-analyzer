                                                     RETAIL INSTALLMENT CONTRACT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. CERTIFICATE OF TITLE - LIENS.
Buyer agrees that any Certificate of Title on the Collateral will show Seller's
security interest (lien) and will be delivered promptly to Seller. Seller has
the right to hold the Certificate of Title until Buyer pays all indebtedness
and performs all other obligations under this Contract. Buyer promises not to
give any other party a lien or security interest in the Collateral without
Sellers written Consent. Buyer promises not to part with possession of, sell or
lease the Collateral without Sellers written approval. Buyer hereby
 (a) agrees that from time to time, at the expense of the Buyer, Buyer will
promptly execute and deliver all further instruments and documents, and take
all further action that may be necessary or desirable, or that Seller may
request, in order to perfect or protect any security interest granted or
purported to be granted hereby or to enable Seller to exercise and enforce its
rights and remedies hereunder with respect to any Collateral, and
(b) grants to Seller the power to sign Buyers name and on behalf of Buyer to
execute and file applications for title, transfers of title, financing
statements, notices of lien and other documents pertaining to any or all of the
Collateral.
2. ASSIGNMENT.
Seller has the right to assign this Contract to PACCAR Financial Corp. If
Seller does assign it, PACCAR Financial Corp. will take all of the Sellers
right, title and interest under this Contract (including Sellers interest in
the Collateral). Thereafter, the term "Seller" in this contract shall mean
PACCAR Financial Corp. This means, among other things, that Buyer will be
required to make the payments under this Contract directly to PACCAR Financial
Corp. Buyer agrees that if Seller assigns this Contract, and PACCAR Financial
Corp. sues Buyer to collect any amount Buyer owes to PACCAR Financial Corp. or
to enforce any of Buyers other obligations to PACCAR Financial Corp., Buyer
will not assert any claim or defense Buyer has against Seller as a claim,
defense, or setoff against PACCAR Financial Corp.
3. INSURANCE
Buyer agrees to keep the collateral continuously insured against fire, theft,
collision, and any other hazard Seller specifies by an insurance company Seller
has approved. The amount of insurance shall be the full insurable value of the
Collateral or the full amount of all obligations this Contract secures,
whichever is greater. The insurance policy shall provide, in a form acceptable
to Seller, for payment of any loss to Seller. Buyer shall deliver promptly to
Seller certificates or, if requested, policies of insurance satisfactory to
Seller, each with a loss-payable endorsement naming Seller or its assigns as
loss-payee as their interests may appear. The insurance policy shall provide
that it can be canceled only after written notice of intention to cancel has
been delivered to Seller at least ten (10) days before the cancellation date.
If the Collateral is lost or damaged, Seller shall have full power to collect
any or all insurance proceeds and to apply them as Seller chooses either to
satisfy any obligation secured by this Contract (whether or rot due or
otherwise matured), or to repair the Collateral. If Buyer obtains insurance
from a company Seller has not approved, or fails to obtain any insurance,
Seller may (but does not have to) obtain any insurance Seller desires to
protect its interests. If Seller does so, Buyer shall reimburse Seller upon
demand for its expenses. Seller shall have no liability at all for any losses
which occur because no insurance has been obtained or the coverage of the
insurance which has been obtained is incomplete.
4. TAXES.
Buyer agrees to pay before delinquency all sales and other taxes, license fees
and other governmental charges imposed on the Collateral or its sale or use.
5. USE OF COLLATERAL
Buyer agrees to keep the Collateral in good repair, to prevent any waste, loss,
damage, or destruction of or to the Collateral; to prevent any unlawful use of
the Collateral; and not to make or allow to be made any significant change in
the Collateral or in its chassis, body or special equipment, without Sellers
written consent. Buyer assumes all risk of damage, loss or destruction of or to
the Collateral, whether or not insured against. Seller may examine the
collateral wherever located at any time, and Buyer will inform Seller of the
Collateral's location upon Sellers request
6. EXPENSES PAID BY SELLER
Buyer agrees to reimburse Seller upon demand for any expenses paid by Seller
such as taxes, insurance premiums, repair bills, title fees, or any expenses
incurred under Section 11. Buyers obligation to pay the expenses shall be
secured by this Contract.
7. TRADE-INS.
If Buyer has traded in any property, Buyer represents and warrants that the
description of it on the front of this Contract is accurate, the title conveyed
is good and its transfer rightful, and that the property is delivered free from
any security interest or other lien or encumbrance.
8. NO WARRANTY.
If the Vehicle is new, there is no warranty other than that of the manufacturer.
If the Vehicle is used, it is sold "AS IS" and "WITH ALL FAULTS".
SELLER MAKES NO WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
UNLESS SET OUT IN WRITING AND SIGNED BY THE SELLER THERE ARE NO OTHER WARRANTIES
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED.
9. ADDITIONS TO COLLATERAL.
Anything added to the Collateral, including but not limited to engines,
transmissions, tires, wheels, fifth wheels, radios and electrical equipment,
tanks and any other body or structure that becomes part of the Collateral, shall
constitute "Additions & Accessions" and shall be subject to Sellers security
interest. All Additions & Accessions must stay with the Collateral if it is
repossessed or returned to Seller.
10. DEFAULT.
Time is of the essence in this Contract. The due dates for payments and the
performance of the other obligations under this contract are among its most
crucial provisions. Buyer shall be in default under this Contract upon the
occurrence of any of the following:
(a) Buyer fails to pay on or before the due date the full amount of any
scheduled payment, taxes, insurance premium, or other obligation secured by this
Contract or under any other instrument or agreement;
(b) Buyer fails to perform any of Buyers obligations under this Contract
(c) Any representation Buyer has made in this Contract or in any credit

(e) The Collateral is seized or levied upon under any legal or governmental
process or proceeding against Buyer or the Collateral;
(f) Buyer becomes insolvent or subject to insolvency proceedings as defined in
the Uniform Commercial Code or becomes subject to bankruptcy;
(g) Buyer defaults in the payment or performance of any other agreement in
connection with any other obligation owed to PACCAR Financial Corp. or for
borrowed money; or
(h) Seller reasonably deems the Collateral in danger of misuse, confiscation,
damage, a destruction.
11. REMEDIES.
If Buyer defaults under this Contract, Seller may, at its option, with or
without notice to Buyer.
(a) Declare this Contract to be in default;
(b) Declare the entire amount of the unpaid Time Balance, after deducting
unearned Time Price Differential in accordance with the applicable state law,
and other charges and indebtedness secured by this Contract immediately due and
payable, without protest, presentment demand or notice (including but riot
limited to notice of intent to accelerate and notice of acceleration), all of
which Buyer waives: and
(c) Exercise all of the rights and remedies of a secured party under the Uniform
Commercial Code and any other applicable laws.
In addition to the foregoing and any other rights Seller has under the law in
effect at the time of default, the following provisions shall apply:
(a) On Sellers demand, Buyer shall deliver possession of the Collateral to
Seller at a place Seller designates reasonably convenient to both parties.
(b) Seller may enter any premises, where the Collateral may be found and take
possession of it without notice, demand, or legal proceedings, provided such

(c) Seller shall give Buyer at least ten (10) days written notice of any sale of
the Collateral, which Buyer agrees to be reasonable notice. Notice shall be
given at the address specified in this Contract or other such address as Buyer

resulting from any disposition of the Collateral after default.

possession of it, Seller will not be in wrongful possession of any property
contained in the Collateral or attached to it in which Seller does not have a
security interest Seller agrees to make any such property available for Buyer to
take back at a place reasonably convenient to both parties.
13. VARIATIONS OF CONTRACT.
No provision of this Contract may be changed or amended unless by a written
contract signed by Seller. Sellers acceptance of late payments does not mean
that Seller is obligated to accept any late payments in the future. No waiver of
any default shall operate as a waiver of any other default
14. ENTIRE AGREEMENT: SEVERABILITY.
This Contract and the attached Exhibits and Addenda is the complete and
exclusive statement of rights and duties between Seller and Buyer. If any
provision is held unenforceable, it shall be deemed omitted without affecting
the enforceability of the remaining provisions.

                                                     RETAIL INSTALLMENT CONTRACT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

15. BAD CHECKS
Whenever a check, draft or order given by or on behalf of Buyer for the purpose
of payment of any obligation arising under this Contract has been dishonored for
lack of funds or credit to pay the item, or because the account has been closed,
or for any other reason, Seller or its assigns will assess and Buyer will
promptly pay a $50 fee per dishonored item, or the maximum amount allowed by
applicable state law, if lower.
16. CROSS COLLATERAL.
Buyer grants to Seller and any assignee of Seller a security interest in the
Collateral to secure the payment and performance of all absolute and all
contingent obligations and liabilities of Buyer to Seller or to such assignee of
Seller, now existing or hereafter arising, whether under this Contract or any
other agreement and whether due directly or by assignment; provided, however,
upon any assignment of the Contract by Seller, the assignee shall be deemed, for
the purpose of this paragraph, the only party with a security interest in the
Collateral.
17. TIME PRICE DIFFERENTIAL.
The parties agree that during the term of the Contract, the effective daily Time
Price Differential ('TPD") shall be based on an interest rate equal to 8.00%
percent per annum, compounded daily on the unpaid balance ("Buyer's Rate"). The
TPD due each month shall be equal to the sum of the daily TPDs for the month.
Based a the Buyer's Rate and assuming that all payments are timely made, the
aggregate TPD will be $84,174.84. Early or late payments over the term of the
Contract will cause the actual aggregate TPD, the Time Balance and Total Tune
Sale Price to be different than disclosed. Any delay in payment could cause
those amounts to be greater than disclosed, resulting in a larger final or
"balloon" payment. Early payments could cause those amounts to be less than
disclosed, resulting in a smaller final or "balloon" payment or reduced number
of payments. In no event shall Buyer be required to pay interest in excess of
the maximum rate allowed by law of the state having jurisdiction over the
transaction. The intention of the parties is to conform strictly to applicable
state usury laws, which may reduce the Buyers Rate to the maximum amount allowed
under such usury laws now or hereafter in effect.
18. FINANCIAL INFORMATION.
Buyer agrees to furnish Seller promptly with any financial statements or other
information which seller may reasonably request from time to time. Any and all
financial statements will be prepared on a basis of generally accepted
accounting principles, and will be complete and correct and fairly present
Buyer's financial condition as of the date thereof. Seller may at any
reasonable time examine the books and records of Buyer and make copies thereof.
19. CHATTEL PAPER.
This specific Security Agreement is to be sold only to PACCAR Financial Corp.
and is subject to the security interest of PACCAR Financial Corp. The only copy
of this Security Agreement which constitutes Chattel Paper for all purposes of
the Uniform Commercial Code is the copy marked "ORIGINAL FOR PACCAR FINANCIAL
CORP." which is delivered to and held by PACCAR Financial Corp. Any change in
the name of the assignee of this Security Agreement from PACCAR Financial Corp.
shall render the copy of this Security Agreement so changed VOID and of no
force and effect. No assignee or secured party other than PACCAR Financial Corp.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Reference is made to the Security Agreement-Retail Contract ("Contract") dated
November 11, 2002 between MICHIGAN KENWORTH, INC ("Seller") AND RUGGED LINER,
INC. ("Buyer").

For valuable consideration, the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, and to
induce Seller to enter into the Contract, Guarantor (meaning all undersigned
Guarantors, if more than one, jointly and severally) hereby unconditionally
guarantees to Seller and its assigns, regardless of the enforceability of the
Contract, or any other circumstances which might affect the liability of
Guarantor that (f) all Buyers indebtedness under the Contract ("Debt"),
including without limitation each installment thereof, will be paid in full when
due, WHETHER at stated maturity or maturity by acceleration or otherwise, in
accordance with the terms of the Contract, and in case of any extension of
time of payment or renewal of any of the Debt, it will be paid in full when due
in accordance with the terms of such extension or renewal, whether at stated
maturity or maturity by acceleration or otherwise. Failing payment when due of
any amount so guaranteed for whatever reason, Guarantor will be obligated to pay
such amount immediately, regardless of whether Seller has proceeded against
Buyer or the Collateral (as defined in the Contract). Guarantor hereby waives
notice of and consents to any extensions of the time of payment, renewals,
releases of Collateral, or other indulgence from time to time granted to Buyer
in respect of any or all of the Debt. Guarantor hereby waives demand of payment,
presentation, protest, notice of sale or other disposition or release or other
handling of the Collateral, and all other notices and demands whatsoever
respecting the Debt or the Collateral. This Guaranty shall bind the Guarantor
and the estate of Guarantor- This Guaranty shall be automatically reinstated if
for any reason any payment in respect of Debt shall be rescinded or must
otherwise be restored, whether as a result of proceedings in bankruptcy or
otherwise. Any of the undersigned Guarantors, if more than one, and any other
party liable in respect of the Debt may be released without affecting the
liability of any undersigned Guarantor or Guarantors not released. Seller may
assign this guaranty to PACCAR Financial Corp., and if it does, PACCAR Financial
Corp. shall have the same rights and remedies as if originally named here in
place of Seller. Guarantor hereby waives notice of acceptance of this guaranty.
Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives and renounces any right or claim Guarantor
would otherwise have against Buyer, whether by way of indemnification,
subrogation, exoneration, right of reimbursement, contribution or otherwise, as
a consequence of Guarantors making any payment under this Guarantee.
