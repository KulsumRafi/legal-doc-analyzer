AGREEMENT</b></font></p> <p> <font size="2" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THIS DEBT SERVICE RESERVE ESCROW AND SECURITY AGREEMENT (this <b>&#147;Agreement&#148;</b>), dated as of July 11, 2002, is
by and between ARV HILLCREEK, LLC, a California limited liability company, (herein, the <b>&#147;Borrower&#148;</b>), and GMAC COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE CORPORATION, a California corporation (together with its successors, transferees and assignees, the
<b>&#147;Lender&#148;</b>).</font></p> <p align="center"> <font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><u>R E C I T A L S</u>:</font></p> <p> <font size="2"
face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Borrower is indebted to the Lender pursuant to a loan in the principal sum of $24,000,000.00 (the
<b>&#147;Loan&#148;</b>) evidenced by that certain Loan Agreement of even date herewith (as the same may hereafter be amended, the <b>&#147;Loan Agreement&#148;</b>) by and between Borrower and Lender.&#160; Capitalized terms used herein without
definition shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Loan Agreement.</font></p> <p> <font size="2"
face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant to the Loan Agreement, Lender requires the establishment and maintenance of a debt service
reserve escrow account to serve as a debt service reserve fund in connection with the Loan and further requires the assignment and pledge of such account to Lender as security for the Loan Obligations (as defined in the Loan Agreement).</font></p>
<p align="center"> <font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><u>A G R E E M E N T</u>:</font></p> <p> <font size="2" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the above and the
mutual promises contained in this Agreement, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, Borrower and Lender agree as follows:&#160; </font></p> <p><font size="2"
face="Times New Roman"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Establishment of Escrow Account</u></b>.&#160; Borrower hereby deposits with Lender, the amount of $508,881.00 (which funds, together with interest from time to
time earned thereon, are collectively referred to herein as the <b>&#147;Debt Service Reserve Funds&#148;</b>).</font></p> <p> <font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Investment of Debt
Service Reserve Funds</u></b>.&#160; The Debt Service Reserve Funds shall be invested and reinvested, from time to time, in certificates of deposit having a maturity of three (3) months as offered to Borrower by Lender.&#160; In the event that
Lender, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default or upon any other event for which this Agreement or the Loan Agreement permits withdrawal of Debt Service Reserve Funds, does cause to be withdrawn all or any part of the Debt Service Reserve
Funds, then Borrower acknowledges that a substantial penalty and loss of interest otherwise accrued may be imposed upon Borrower as a result of such withdrawal prior to the maturity of the investment.&#160; All the Debt Service Reserve Funds as
invested are herein referred to as the <b>&#147;Debt Service Reserve Funds Escrow Account&#148;</b>.&#160; All interest which shall accrue on the Debt Service Reserve Funds shall remain in the Debt Service Reserve Funds Escrow Account to be
disbursed to Borrower annually provided that there is no outstanding Event of Default under the Loan Agreement.</font></p>

  <p> <font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Grant of Security Interest</u></b>.&#160; In order to secure the Loan Obligations, the Borrower hereby
assigns, sells, transfers, pledges, sets over and delivers to the Lender and grants Lender a security interest in the Debt Service Reserve Funds then held by Lender in the Debt Service Reserve Funds Escrow Account, including all accrued interest
thereon which from time to time has not been disbursed to Borrower, together with all instruments now or hereafter existing evidencing the Debt Service Reserve Funds Escrow Account.</font></p> <p> <font size="2"
face="Times New Roman"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Powers of Lender</u></b>.&#160; The Borrower hereby constitutes and appoints the Lender the true and lawful attorney of the Borrower, with full power of
substitution, (a)&nbsp;to ask, demand, collect, receive, receipt for, sue for, compound and give acquittance for any and all amounts which may be or become due or payable under the Debt Service Reserve Funds Escrow Account; (b)&nbsp;to execute any
and all withdrawal receipts or other orders for the payment of money on the Debt Service Reserve Funds Escrow Account; (c)&nbsp;to endorse the name of the Borrower on any instrument given in evidence, payment, or partial payment thereof; (d)&nbsp;in
its discretion, to file any claim or take any other action or proceeding, either in its own name or in the name of the Borrower or otherwise, which the Lender may deem necessary or appropriate to protect and preserve its right, title, and interest
hereunder; and, (e)&nbsp; without limiting the foregoing the Lender shall have and is hereby given full power to transfer the Debt Service Reserve Funds Escrow Account into the name of the Lender or its nominee.</font></p> <p><font size="2"
face="Times New Roman"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Payment Upon Default</u></b>.&#160; The Borrower hereby authorizes and empowers the Lender, without further order, notice, or direction from or to the Borrower
upon the occurrence of any Event of Default pursuant to the Loan Agreement, to apply all or any part of the Debt Service Reserve Funds (including any interest which has accrued thereon and has not yet been disbursed to Borrower) in full or partial
payment of the Loan Obligations, whether or not then due, in such order, manner, and extent as the Lender may elect.&#160; Should Lender elect to withdraw any declaration of an Event of Default, then upon request of the Lender, Borrower will
replenish any funds applied by Lender to the Loan Obligations from the Debt Service Reserve Funds Escrow Account.</font></p> <p> <font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Representations
and Warranties</u></b>.&#160; The Borrower hereby represents and warrants that the Borrower has full power and authority to pledge and grant to Lender a security interest in the Debt Service Reserve Funds in the Debt Service Reserve Funds Escrow
Account, and that the Debt Service Reserve Funds Escrow Account is free and clear of all liens and encumbrances of any nature whatsoever (other than the assignment, pledge and security interest created hereby), and Borrower will not further encumber
the Debt Service Reserve Funds Escrow Account without Lender&#146;s prior written consent which may be withheld in its sole and absolute discretion.</font></p> <p> <font size="2"
face="Times New Roman"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Termination of Agreement</u></b>.&#160; This is a continuing pledge and security interest, and this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect until such
time as either (a) the Borrower pays in full all Loan Obligations and such payments have become final and are not subject to being refunded or rescinded under the federal Bankruptcy Code or other applicable law, or (b) Golden Creek has achieved an
annual average occupancy level of ninety percent (90% as measured at the end of the most recent fiscal quarter of the Facility) and a Debt Service Ratio for the Facility after Assumed Management Fees of not less than 1.25 to 1.0 for three (3)
consecutive months at which time this Agreement shall become null and void; otherwise, it shall remain in full force and effect until proper release thereof is made in writing by the Lender.&#160; Upon termination of this</font></p> <p
