          So long as any shares of the Series D Preferred Stock remain outstanding
          (subject to Section 4(d) hereof), the Corporation shall not pay management fees
          to insiders other than those set forth on <U>Schedule A</U> hereto, or make any
          payment to any Director, Executive Officer, or Known 10% Holder of the
          Corporation, other than as compensation as an employee or director, unless such
          payment is at market rates, terms and conditions determined in the good faith
          judgment of the Board of Directors, except in those instances where such payment
          is required by law or by an agreement in effect on the date hereof by which the
          Corporation is obligated to make such payment. &#147;Executive Officer&#148; for

          individual serving as a director of the Corporation with the right to vote at

          If at any time between the date hereof and the first anniversary of the date
          hereof the Corporation receives a cash dividend or other cash distribution from
          any Subsidiary of the Corporation, then 50% of the Net Dividend (as defined
          below) shall be applied to the redemption of outstanding shares of Series D
          Preferred Stock (to the extent that shares of Series D Preferred Stock are then
          outstanding), with such redemption to take effect as promptly as reasonably
          practical following receipt of the Net Dividend by the Corporation, but in no
          event later than 20 Business Days after receipt of such dividend or
          distribution. &#147;Net Dividend&#148; means the cash amount of the dividend or
          distribution actually received by the Corporation from its Subsidiary, less (x)
          that portion of the dividend or distribution, if any, as to which application to
          redemption of outstanding shares of Series D Preferred Stock would violate any
          agreement with a lender by which the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries is
          bound, and (y) that portion of the dividend or distribution, if any, which is
          applied by the Corporation (or is intended to be applied by the Corporation, as
          determined in good faith by the Board of Directors) to one or more of the
          following purposes: (i) payments to holders of Series D Preferred Stock, (ii)
          payment of directors and officers insurance or any other corporate insurance
          premiums, (iii) payment of taxes, or (iv)&nbsp;payment of audit, accounting,
          and/or legal fees. </FONT></P>

be made by an investor who can afford the loss of its entire investment and whose
financial condition would not be materially adversely effected if such loss is actually
sustained, and the Purchaser represents and warrants that it is that type of investor. The
Purchaser acknowledges that it does not anticipate that the Securities will achieve,
