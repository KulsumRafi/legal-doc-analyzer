Dear Brian,

     On behalf of Esperion Therapeutics, Inc. (the "Company"), I am pleased to
offer you a position with the Company. The following is an outline of the terms
of this offer:

1.   The position offered is that of Vice President, in the department of
     Pharmacology.

2.   You shall be paid an initial monthly salary of $11,667.00 plus a bonus of
     up to 20% of base salary. The right to receive a bonus for the first year
     of employment or portion thereof for which the Company pays bonuses is
     dependent on continued employment during that period. The magnitude of the
     bonus, if any, will be determined, based upon achievement of a series of
     mutually agreed upon performance objectives/milestones. A proposed series
     of objectives/milestones will be developed between you and your supervisor.

3.   A benefits package will be provided to you which is equivalent to that
     offered to other similarly situated employees with the Company.

4.   Subject to meeting eligibility requirements, we intend to grant to you an
     option to purchase up to 80,000 shares of the Company's common stock under
     one of the Company's equity compensation plans, subject to the approval of
     our Board of Directors. The option grant will become effective on the date
     of such approval, and will have an exercise price that will be equal to or
     greater than the fair market value of a share of our stock on the date of
     such approval, as determined by the Board of Directors. The terms and
     conditions of the option, along with the period during which the option
     will become exercisable, will be set forth in a Stock Option Agreement that
     you will be required to execute.

5.   You will be required to execute the Company's standard forms of
     Non-Competition, as well as Confidentiality and Assignment Agreement.

     If the terms of this offer are acceptable to you, please so indicate by
executing in the space provided below and fax to 734-622-8333, as well as mail
(an original copy) to the Company. Please respond to this offer within two weeks
from the date hereof. After this date (i.e. after February 28, 2001), this offer
may be withdrawn at the discretion of the Company.

     Welcome to Esperion Therapeutics! We look forward to working with you to
bring new medicines to a world of unmet medical needs.

                                Sincerely,

                                /s/ Tim Mayleben
