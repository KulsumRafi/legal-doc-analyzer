     2.3 Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation. The directors and

and until his or her successor is duly elected or appointed and qualified.


                                   ARTICLE III

                        Effect of the Merger; CONVERSION

     3.1 Effect on Capital Stock. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of any holders of shares of Company
Common Stock or any shares of capital stock of Newco:

          (a) Newco Common Stock. Each share of capital stock of Newco issued
     and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted
     into one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the
     Surviving Corporation.

          (b) Cancellation of Treasury Stock. Each share of Company Common Stock
     that is owned by the Company or by any subsidiary of the Company shall
     automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and no shares of common
     stock, no par value, of Parent (including the Rights (as hereinafter
     defined) attached thereto, the "Parent Common Stock"), cash or other
     consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

          (c) Conversion of Company Common Stock. Each issued and outstanding
     share of Company Common Stock (other than shares to be canceled in
     accordance with Section 3.1(b)) (collectively, the "Exchanging Company
     Shares") shall be converted into the right to receive 0.1501 (the "Exchange
     Ratio") shares of Parent Common Stock (the "Merger Consideration").

          (d) Stock Options and Warrants. At the Effective Time, except as
     provided in Section 8.1(d), all rights with respect to Company Common Stock
     pursuant to any Company stock options or Company warrants which are
     outstanding at the Effective Time (each of which is set forth in Section
     5.3 of the Disclosure Schedule), whether or not then exercisable, shall be
     converted into and become rights with respect to Parent Common Stock in
     accordance with the terms of any stock option plan under which they were
     issued and any stock option agreement or warrant agreement, as the case may
     be, by which they are evidenced. It is intended that the foregoing
     provisions shall be undertaken in a manner that will not constitute a
     "modification" as defined in Section 425 of the Code as to any stock option
     which is an "incentive stock option." After


<PAGE>
                                      -4-


     the Effective Time, each Company stock option or warrant set forth in
     Section 5.3 of the Disclosure Schedule shall be exercisable for that number
     of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the number of Company Stock
     subject thereto multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, and shall have an
     exercise price per share equal to the Company exercise price divided by the
     Exchange Ratio and, unless provided otherwise under the stock option plan
     agreement or warrant agreement, as the case may be, by which it is
     evidenced, upon conversion the exercise price of each such stock option or
     warrant shall be rounded up to the nearest $0.01 and the number of shares
     issuable upon exercise shall be rounded down to the nearest full share.
     Parent agrees to abide by the terms of any registration rights described in
     Section 5.3 of the Disclosure Schedule.

     3.2 Exchange of Certificates. (a) Exchange Agent. As promptly as
practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall make available to Branch
Banking and Trust Company or such other bank or trust company designated by
Parent (the "Exchange Agent"), from time to time upon request of the Exchange
Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Company Common Stock immediately prior
to the Effective Time, for exchange in accordance with this Article III through
the Exchange Agent, certificates evidencing shares of Parent Common Stock
issuable to holders of Company Common Stock to satisfy the requirements set
forth in Section 3.1 relating to Merger Consideration and cash necessary to make
requisite Additional Payments (as hereinafter defined).

     (b) Exchange Procedures. As promptly as practicable after the Effective
Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each record holder of a
certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the "Certificates") (i)
a letter of transmittal (which shall be in customary form and shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall
pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and
(ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for the Merger Consideration.

     (c) Exchange of Certificates. Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a
Certificate for cancellation, together with such letter of transmittal, duly
executed and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such
other documents as may be reasonably required pursuant to such instructions, the
holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a
certificate representing that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock, if
any, constituting Merger Consideration to which such holder is entitled pursuant
to this Article III (together with any cash in lieu of any fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 3.2(e)
and any dividends or other distributions to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to Section 3.2(d) (together, the "Additional Payments")), and the
Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock which is not regis-


<PAGE>
                                      -5-


tered in the transfer records of the Company, the applicable Merger
Consideration and Additional Payments, if any, may be issued to a transferee if
the Certificate representing such shares of Company Common Stock is presented to
the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect
such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been
paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 3.2, each Certificate
shall be deemed at all times after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive upon such surrender the applicable Merger Consideration with
respect to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented thereby and
Additional Payments, if any.

     (d) Distributions with Respect to Unsurrendered Certificates. No dividends
or other distributions declared or made after the Effective Time with respect to
Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to
the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to Parent Common Stock
the holder thereof is entitled to receive upon surrender thereof, and no cash
payment in lieu of any fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder
pursuant to Section 3.2(e), until the holder of such Certificate shall surrender
such Certificate. Subject to the effect of escheat, tax or other applicable
laws, following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the
holder of the certificates representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock
issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) promptly, the amount of any
cash payable with respect to fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which
such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 3.2(e) and the amount of dividends
or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time and
theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock, and
(ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other
distributions, with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to
surrender and a payment date occurring after surrender, payable with respect to
such whole shares of Parent Common Stock.

     (e) No Fractional Shares. (i) No certificates representing fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of
Certificates, no dividend or distribution of Parent shall relate to such
fractional share interests and such fractional share interests shall not entitle
the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a shareholder of Parent. For
purposes of this Section 3.2(e), all fractional shares to which a single record
holder of Company Common Stock would otherwise be entitled shall be aggregated
and calculations shall be rounded to three decimal places.

     (ii) Each holder of shares of Company Common Stock exchanged pursuant to
the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a
share of Parent Common Stock (after taking into account all such shares held by
such holder) shall be entitled to receive cash (without interest) in an amount,
less the amount of any withholding taxes which may be required thereon, equal to
such fractional part of a share of Parent Common Stock multiplied by the closing
sales price for a share of Parent Common Stock on the New

                                      -6-


York Stock Exchange, Inc. (the "NYSE") Composite Transactions Tape (as reported
by The Wall Street Journal (Northeast edition), or, if not reported thereby, as
reported in another authoritative source selected by Parent) (the "NYSE
Composite Transaction Tape"), on the Closing Date.

     (iii) As soon as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash,
if any, to be paid to holders of Certificates with respect to any fractional
share interests, the Exchange Agent shall make available such amounts, without
interest, to such holders subject to and in accordance with the terms of Section
3.2(d).

     (f) No Liability. None of the Exchange Agent, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation shall be liable to any holder of Certificates for any shares of
Parent Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto), or
cash delivered to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat
or similar law.

     (g) Withholding Rights. Each of the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Certificates such amounts as they
are required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code, or any applicable provision of state, local or foreign tax law.
To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation or
Parent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Certificates
in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving
Corporation or Parent, as the case may be.

     (h) Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the
Surviving Corporation or Parent, the posting by such person of a bond, in such
reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation or Parent may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against them with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration and Additional
Payments, if any.

     (i) Anti-Dilution. The Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted to reflect fully
the effect of any stock split, reverse split, stock dividend (including any
dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Company Common Stock or
Parent Common Stock, as applicable), extraordinary dividend, reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification or any other like change with respect to
Company Common Stock or Parent Common Stock occurring after the date hereof and
prior to the Effective Time. References to the Exchange Ratio elsewhere in this
Agreement shall be deemed to refer to the Exchange Ratio as it may have been
adjusted pursuant to this Section 3.2(i).

                  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

     Except as expressly set forth in the Disclosure Schedule (with specific
reference to the particular Section or subsection of this Agreement to which the
information stated in such Disclosure Schedule relates, with such disclosure to
be applicable to other Sections or subsections of this Agreement to the extent a
matter is disclosed in such a way as to make its relevance to the information

subsidiaries is duly qualified as a foreign corporation to do business, and is
in good standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of its properties
owned or leased or the nature of its activities makes such qualification
necessary, except for failures to be so qualified or in good standing which
would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a mate-

                                      -8-


rial adverse effect on the business, assets, liabilities, results of operations,
condition (financial or otherwise) or prospects of the Company and its
subsidiaries, taken as a whole (a "Company Material Adverse Effect"). Section

     5.2 Capital Stock of Subsidiaries. The only direct or indirect subsidiaries
of the Company are those listed in Section 5.2 of the Disclosure Schedule. The
Company is directly or indirectly the record and beneficial owner of all of the
outstanding shares of capital stock of each of its subsidiaries, there are no

warrants, scrip, rights to subscribe for, calls or commitments of any character
whatsoever relating to, or securities or rights convertible into or exchangeable
for, shares of any capital stock of any such subsidiary, and there are no
contracts, commitments, understandings or arrangements by which any such
subsidiary is bound to issue additional shares of its capital stock or

Merger and other transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of
this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger and other transactions
contemplated hereby have been duly and validly authorized by the Board of

offering of Company Common Stock and warrants to purchase Company Common Stock

<PAGE>
                                      -11-


ters ended July 31, 2002 and October 31, 2002 (the "Company 10-Qs" and, together
with the Company IPO Registration Statement and the Company IPO Prospectus, the
"Company SEC Reports"), all of which complied when filed in all material
respects with all applicable requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the "Securities
Act"), the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder (the "Exchange Act") and/or the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (with respect to the provisions of such act required
to be complied with at the time such forms, reports and/or documents were
required to be filed) and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the
"Sarbanes-Oxley Act") and, to the knowledge of the Company, the statements
contained in or accompanying the Company 10-Qs in accordance with Sections 302
and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act are true and correct. The audited consolidated
financial statements and unaudited consolidated interim financial statements of
the Company and its subsidiaries included in such Company SEC Reports were
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP")
applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be
indicated in the notes thereto and except, in the case of such unaudited
consolidated interim financial statements, for the omission of normal year-end
adjustments) and present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position and results of operations and cash flows of the Company and its
subsidiaries on a consolidated basis at the respective dates and for the
respective periods indicated. At the time of effectiveness and/or filing with
the SEC of such Company SEC Reports, none of the Company SEC Reports contained
any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. The Company has provided to Parent copies of all other
correspondence sent to or received from the SEC by the Company and its
subsidiaries or their counsel or accountants since April 25, 2002.

     (b) The Company has provided to Parent true and complete copies of the
unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the Company at December 25, 2002 (the
"December 2002 Balance Sheet") and the unaudited consolidated statement of
income of the Company for the period from October 31, 2002 through December 25,
2002 (collectively, the "December 2002 Financials"). The December 2002
Financials fairly present, in all material respects, the consolidated financial
position of the Company at December 25, 2002, and the consolidated results of
operations of the Company for the period then ended, and have been prepared in
accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis, except that such financial
statements do not include a statement of cash flows or any footnote disclosures
that would otherwise be required to be included by GAAP, and are also subject to
normal non-recurring year-end audit adjustments. The December 2002 Balance Sheet
reflects all liabilities of the Company, whether absolute, accrued or
contingent, as of the date thereof of the type required to be reflected or
disclosed on a balance sheet prepared in accordance with GAAP.

     limitation, writing down the value of inventory or writing off notes or
     accounts receivables;

          (f) there has not been any damage, destruction or loss, whether

     subsidiaries to (i) do any of the things described in the preceding clauses
     (a) through (f) other than as expressly contemplated or provided for in

information prepared by or relating solely to Parent and Newco) will comply as
to form in all material respects with the provisions of the Securities Act and
the Exchange Act.

material default) under any contract or commitment referred to in this Section

Company becoming due, going into default or giving the lenders or other holders
of debt instruments the right to require the Company or any of its subsidiaries
to repay all or a portion of such loans or borrowings.

subsidiaries or by any person acting on their behalf in connection with the
sale, management, administration or termination of a franchise contains or

connection therewith not misleading. The Company is not aware of any fact,
circumstance or condition related to franchising activities which could have a
Company Material Adverse Effect or impair the Company's ability to consummate
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. The Company's

within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code or that would prevent an
exchange of Company Common Stock for Parent Common Stock pursuant to the Merger
from qualifying as an exchange described in Section 354 of the Code (except with
respect to any cash received in lieu of a fractional share). Neither the Company
nor, to the knowledge of the Company, any of its affiliates is aware of any
agreement, plan or other circumstance that would prevent the Merger from
qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code
or that would prevent an exchange of Company Common Stock for Parent Common
Stock pursuant to the Merger from qualifying as an exchange described in Section
354 of the Code (except with respect to any cash received in lieu of a
fractional share) and, to the knowledge of the Company, the Merger and each such
exchange will so qualify.

     5.28 Full Disclosure. As of the date hereof and as of the Closing Date, as
the case may be, all statements contained in any schedule, exhibit, certificate
or other instrument delivered by or on behalf of the Company pursuant to this
Agreement are, or, in respect

                                      -27-


of any such instrument to be delivered on or prior to the Closing Date, as of
its date and as of the Closing Date will be, accurate and complete in all
material respects, authentic and incorporated herein by reference and constitute
or will constitute the representations and warranties of the Company. No
representation or warranty of the Company contained in this Agreement contains
any untrue statement or omits to state a fact necessary in order to make the
statements herein or therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading in any material respect.


                                   ARTICLE VI

               REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND NEWCO

     Except as expressly set forth on the Disclosure Schedule (with specific
reference to the Section or subsection of this Agreement to which the
information stated in such Disclosure Schedule relates, with such disclosure to
be applicable to other Sections or subsections of this Agreement to the extent a
matter is disclosed in such a way as to make its relevance to the information
called for by such other Sections or subsections readily apparent) delivered by
Parent and Newco to the Company in connection with the execution of this
Agreement, Parent and Newco represent and warrant to the Company as follows:

     6.1 Organization and Qualification. Each of Parent and Newco is a
corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws
of the jurisdiction of its incorporation and has all requisite corporate power
and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its
business as now being conducted. Each of Parent and Newco is duly qualified as a
foreign corporation to do business, and is in good standing, in each
jurisdiction where the character of its properties owned or leased or the nature
of its activities makes such qualification necessary, except for failures to be
so qualified or in good standing which would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the business, assets, liabilities,
results of operations, condition (financial or otherwise) or prospects of Parent
and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole (a "Parent Material Adverse Effect").
Neither Parent nor Newco is in violation of any of the provisions of its
certificate or articles of incorporation or organization or by-laws. Parent has
delivered to the Company accurate and complete copies of the certificate or
articles of incorporation or organization (or other applicable charter document)
and by-laws, as currently in effect, of each of Parent and Newco.

                                      -28-


     6.2 Capitalization. (a) The authorized capital stock of Parent consists of
300,000,000 shares of Parent Common Stock and 10,000,000 shares of preferred
stock, no par value. As of December 6, 2002, 56,207,012 shares of Parent Common
Stock were issued and outstanding and no shares of preferred stock of Parent
were issued and outstanding. The Parent Common Stock, including the shares of
Parent Common Stock to be issued in exchange for Company Common Stock, have
attached thereto rights (the "Rights") to purchase one one-hundredth (1/100) of
a share of Series A Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock (the "Series A
Preferred Stock"). The Rights are issued pursuant to a Rights Agreement (the
"Rights Agreement") dated as of January 18, 2000 between Parent and Branch
Banking and Trust Company. All of such issued and outstanding shares are, and
any shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in connection with this
Agreement, the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby will be, validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable and free of preemptive rights. Parent has
reserved for issuance a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock to
cover the exercise of all outstanding options and warrants of the Company which
shall remain outstanding upon consummation of the Merger as set forth in Section
5.3 of the Disclosure Schedule.

     (b) Newco was formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, has engaged in no other business activities and
has conducted its operations only as contemplated by this Agreement. The
authorized capital stock of Newco consists of 1,000 shares of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, and Parent is directly the record and beneficial owner of
all such shares, and all of such shares so owned by Parent are validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable and are owned by Parent free and clear of any
claim, lien or encumbrance of any kind with respect thereto.

     6.3 Authority Relative to This Agreement. Each of Parent and Newco has full
corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to
consummate the Merger and other transactions contemplated hereby. The execution
and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger and other
transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and validly authorized by the
Board of Directors of each of Parent and Newco and no other corporate
proceedings on the part of Parent or Newco are necessary to authorize this
Agreement or to consummate the Merger or other transactions contemplated hereby
except the approval of Parent, as the sole stockholder of Newco which has been
obtained simultaneously with the execution and delivery hereof. This Agreement
has been duly and validly executed and delivered by Parent and Newco and,
assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery hereof by the Company,
constitutes a valid and binding agreement of each of Parent and Newco,
enforceable against each of them in accordance with its terms, except to the
extent that its enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other laws affecting the enforcement
of creditors' rights generally or by general equitable or fiduciary principles.

     6.4 No Violations, etc. (a) Assuming that all filings, permits,
authorizations, consents and approvals or waivers thereof have been duly made or
obtained as contemplated by Section 6.4(b) hereof, neither the execution and
delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Newco nor the consummation of the
Merger or other transactions contemplated hereby nor compliance by Parent or
Newco with any of the provisions hereof will (i) violate, conflict with, or
result in a breach of any provision of, or constitute a default (or an event
which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default) under,
or result in the termination or suspension of, or accelerate the performance
required by, or result in a right of termination or acceleration under, or
result in the creation of any lien, security interest, charge or encumbrance
upon any of the properties or assets of Parent or any of its subsidiaries under,
any of the terms, conditions or provisions of (x) their respective certificate
or articles of incorporation or organization or by-laws, (y) any note, bond,
mortgage, indenture or deed of trust, or (z) any license, lease, agreement or
other instrument or obligation to which Parent or any such subsidiary is a party
or to which they or any of their respective properties or assets may be subject,
or (ii) violate any judgment, ruling, order, writ, injunction, decree, statute,
rule or regulation applicable to Parent or any of its subsidiaries or any of
their respective properties or assets, except, in the case of clauses (i)(z) and
(ii) above, for such violations, conflicts, breaches, defaults, terminations,
suspensions, accelerations, rights of termination or acceleration or creations
of liens, security interests, charges or encumbrances which would not,
individually or in the aggregate, either have a Parent Material Adverse Effect
or impair Parent's or Newco's ability to consummate the Merger or other
transactions contemplated hereby.

     (b) No filing or registration with, notification to or permit,
authorization, consent or approval of any governmental entity is required by
Parent, Newco or any of Parent's other subsidiaries in connection with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement or the consummation by Newco of the
Merger or other transactions contemplated hereby, except (i) the filing of the
Certificate of Merger, (ii) filings with the NYSE and, if applicable, the
American Stock Exchange, Inc., (iii) filings with the SEC and state securities
administrators, and (iv) such other filings, registrations, notifications,
permits, authorizations, consents or approvals the failure of which to be
obtained, made or given would not, individually or in the aggregate, either have
a Parent Material Adverse Effect or impair Parent's or Newco's ability to
consummate the Merger or other transactions contemplated hereby.

     (c) As of the date hereof, Parent and its subsidiaries are not in violation
of or default under (x) their respective certificates or articles of
incorporation or organization or by-laws, (y) any note, bond, mortgage,
indenture or deed of trust, or (z) any license, lease, agreement or other
instrument or obligation to which Parent or any such subsidiary is a party or to
which they or any of their respective properties or assets may be subject,
except, in the case of clauses (y) and (z) above, for such violations or
defaults which would not, individually or in the aggregate, either have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect or impair Parent's or Newco's ability to consummate the
Merger or other transactions contemplated hereby.

     6.5 Commission Filings; Consolidated Financial Statements. Parent has filed
all required forms, reports and documents with the SEC since Parent's
Registration Statement on Form S-1 relating to its initial public offering was
declared effective by the SEC on April 4, 2000, including, in the form filed
with the SEC together with any amendments thereto, (i) its Annual Report on Form
10-K for the fiscal year ended February 3, 2002 (the "Parent 10-K"), (ii) the
proxy statement relating to Parent's annual meeting of shareholders held on June
5, 2002 (the "Parent Current Proxy"), (iii) its Current Report on Form 8-K dated
August 29, 2002 (the "Parent Current 8-K"), (iv) its Quarterly Reports on Form
10-Q for the fiscal quarters ended May 5, 2002, August 4, 2002 and November 3,
2002 (the "Parent Current 10-Qs" and, together with the Parent 10-K, the Parent
Current Proxy and the Parent Current 8-K, the "Parent Current SEC Reports") and
(iv) all other reports or registration statements filed by Parent with the SEC
since April 4, 2000 (collectively, the "Parent SEC Reports"), all of which
complied when filed in all material respects with all applicable requirements of
the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and/or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (with respect
to the provisions of such act required to be complied with at the time such
forms, reports and/or documents were required to be filed) and, to the knowledge
of Parent, the statements contained in or accompanying the Parent Current SEC
Reports in accordance with Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act are
true and correct. The audited consolidated financial statements and unaudited
consolidated interim financial statements of Parent and its subsidiaries
included in such Parent SEC Reports were prepared in accordance with GAAP during
the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto and
except, in the case of such unaudited consolidated interim financial statements,
for the omission of normal year-end adjustments) and present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position and results of operations and cash
flows of Parent and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis at the respective
dates and for the respective periods indicated (and in the case of all such
financial statements that are interim financial statements, contain all
adjustments so to present fairly). At the time of effectiveness and/or filing
with the SEC of such Parent SEC Reports, none of the Parent SEC Reports
contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. Parent has not received any substantive comments from the SEC
with respect to any of its filings under the Exchange Act.

     6.6 Form S-4; Information Statement. None of the information supplied or to
be supplied by or on behalf of Parent and Newco for inclusion or incorporation
by reference in the Registration Statement will, at the time the Registration
Statement becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. None of the
information supplied or to be supplied by or on behalf of Parent and Newco for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Information Statement will, at
the dates mailed to stockholders and at the


<PAGE>
                                      -31-


Effective Time, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading. Parent will promptly inform the Company of the happening of any
event prior to the Effective Time which would render such information regarding
Parent or Newco incorrect in any material respect or require the amendment of
the Information Statement. The Registration Statement and the Information
Statement (except for information relating solely to the Company) will comply as
to form in all material respects with the provisions of the Securities Act and
the Exchange Act.

     6.7 Litigation. Except as set forth in the Parent SEC Reports and except as
would not have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, there is no (i) claim, action,
suit or proceeding pending or, to the knowledge of Parent or any of its
subsidiaries, threatened against or relating to Parent or any of its
subsidiaries before any court or governmental or regulatory authority or body or
arbitration tribunal, or (ii) outstanding judgment, order, writ, injunction or
decree, or application, request or motion therefor, of any court, governmental
agency or arbitration tribunal in a proceeding to which Parent, any subsidiary
of Parent or any of their respective assets was or is a party.

     6.8 Board Recommendation. The Board of Directors of Parent has, by
unanimous vote at a telephonic meeting of such board duly held on January 23,
2003, approved and adopted this Agreement and the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby (including, without limitation, the issuance of
Parent Common Stock as a result of the Merger). The Board of Directors of Newco
has, by unanimous written consent dated January 23, 2003, declared the
advisability of and approved and adopted this Agreement and the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby.

     6.9 Tax Free Reorganization. None of Parent, Newco or any affiliate of
Parent or Newco has taken, agreed to take or will take any action that would
prevent the Merger from constituting a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code. None of Parent, Newco or any affiliate of Parent is
aware of any agreement, plan or other circumstance that would prevent the Merger
from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code and, to the knowledge of Parent, the Merger will so qualify.

course of business consistent with past practice, and will use all commercially
reasonable efforts to preserve intact its business organization, to keep
available the services of its officers and employees and to maintain
satisfactory relationships with suppliers, distributors, customers and others
having material business relationships with it, if the loss of such business
relationship would have a Company Material Adverse Effect, and will take no
action which would impair the ability of the parties to consummate the Merger or
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, and except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement, prior to the Effective Time, the Company will not nor will it permit
any of its subsidiaries to, without the prior written consent of Parent, which

following the date of this Agreement, the Company, Parent and Newco shall
prepare and file with the SEC the Registration Statement, in which the
Information Statement shall be included. Each of the Company, Parent and Newco
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to have the Registration Statement
declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after
such filing. The Information Statement shall disclose that the Board of
Directors of the Company has voted in favor of approval and adoption of this
Agreement and the Merger, and that the Boards of Directors of Parent and Newco
have voted in favor of approval of the issuance of Parent Common Stock in
connection with the Merger. The Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the Information Statement to be mailed to its stockholders as
promptly as practicable after the Registration Statement becomes effective.

     (b) The Company, Parent and Newco shall make all necessary filings with
respect to the Merger and the transactions contemplated thereby under the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act and applicable state blue sky laws and the
rules and regulations thereunder. Parent shall also take any action required to
be taken under any applicable state securities laws in connection with the
issuance of Parent Common Stock in connection with the Merger. No filing of, or
amendment or supplement to, the Registration Statement will be made by Parent
without providing the Company and its counsel the opportunity to review and
comment thereon and, with respect to any material pertaining to the Company,
without the Company's written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld. Parent will advise the Company, immediately after it receives notice
thereof, of the time when the Registration Statement has become effective or any
supplement or amendment has been filed, the issuance of any stop order, the
suspension of the qualification of the Parent Common Stock issuable in
connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or any
request by the SEC for amendment of the Registration Statement or comments
thereon and responses thereto or requests by the SEC for additional information.
If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information relating to the
Company, Parent or Newco, or any of their respective affiliates, officers or
directors, should be discovered by the Company, Parent or Newco which should be
set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement so that
such Registra-


<PAGE>
                                      -35-


tion Statement would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party which
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and an
appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be
promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by law, disseminated to
the stockholders of the Company.

     7.3 Letters and Consents of the Company's Accountants. The Company shall
use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be delivered to Parent all
consents required from its independent accountants necessary to effect the
registration of the Parent Common Stock and make any required filing with the
SEC in connection with the Merger and the transactions contemplated thereby.

     7.4 Additional Agreements; Cooperation. (a) Subject to the terms and
conditions herein provided, each of the parties hereto agrees to use
commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action and to
do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate
and make effective as promptly as commercially reasonable the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and to reasonably cooperate with each other in
connection with the foregoing, including using commercially reasonable efforts
(i) to obtain all necessary waivers, consents and approvals from other parties
to loan agreements, material leases and other material contracts that are
specified in Section 7.4 to the Disclosure Schedule, (ii) to obtain all
necessary consents, approvals and authorizations as are required to be obtained
under any federal, state or foreign law or regulations, (iii) to defend all
lawsuits or other legal proceedings challenging this Agreement or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, (iv) to lift or rescind
any injunction or restraining order or other order adversely affecting the
ability of the parties to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, (v)
to effect all necessary registrations and filings and submissions of information
requested by governmental authorities, (vi) provide all necessary information
for the Registration Statement and (vii) to fulfill all conditions to this
Agreement.

     7.5 Publicity. The Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Newco, on the
other hand, agree to consult with each other in issuing any press release and
with respect to the general content of other public statements with respect to
the transactions contemplated hereby, and shall not issue any such press release
prior to such consultation, except as may be required by law. The parties agree
that the initial press release to be issued with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be in the form previously agreed to by the
parties.

     7.6 No Solicitation. The Company agrees that it shall not, nor shall it
permit any of its subsidiaries to, nor shall it authorize or permit any officer,
director or employee or any investment banker, attorney, accountant, agent or
other advisor or representative of the


<PAGE>
                                      -36-


Company or any of its subsidiaries to, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly
encourage the submission of any Takeover Proposal (as hereinafter defined), (ii)
enter into any agreement with respect to a Takeover Proposal or (iii)
participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any
person any information with respect to, or take any other action to facilitate
any inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably
be expected to lead to, any Takeover Proposal. For all purposes of this
Agreement, "Takeover Proposal" means any proposal for a merger, consolidation,
share exchange, business combination or other similar transaction involving the
Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries (as hereinafter defined) or any
proposal or offer to acquire, directly or indirectly, an equity interest in, any
voting securities of, or a substantial portion of the assets of, the Company or
any of its Significant Subsidiaries. The Company immediately shall cease and
cause to be terminated all existing discussions or negotiations with any persons
conducted heretofore with respect to, or that could reasonably be expected to
lead to, any Takeover Proposal. As used herein, a "Significant Subsidiary" means
any subsidiary of the Company that would constitute a "significant subsidiary"
within the meaning of Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X of the SEC.

     7.7 Access to Information; Confidentiality. (a) From the date of this
Agreement until the Effective Time, each of the Company and Parent (on behalf of
Parent and Newco), after reasonable notice, will give the other party and its
authorized representatives (including counsel, environmental and other
consultants, accountants and auditors) reasonable access during normal business
hours to all facilities, personnel and operations and to all books and records
of it and its subsidiaries, will permit the other party to make such inspections
as it may reasonably require and will cause its officers and those of its
subsidiaries, after reasonable notice, to furnish the other party with such
financial and operating data and other information with respect to its business
and properties as such party may from time to time reasonably request. In the
event Parent and/or Newco or their authorized representatives perform testing of
any property owned or leased by the Company, Parent, at Parent's cost and
expense, shall return such property to its previous condition immediately
following the conclusion of such testing. Any such testing may be further
limited by, and must be conducted in conformance with, the provisions of any
applicable lease or other agreement to which the Company or any of its
subsidiaries is a party.

     (b) All documents and information furnished pursuant to this agreement
shall be subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Confidentiality
