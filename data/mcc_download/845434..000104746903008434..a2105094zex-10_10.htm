<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>Purpose of the Program.  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the Officer and Director Stock Ownership Program is to increase the level of ownership of the Company's stock by officers and directors, and to
foster and promote long-term financial success of the Company by attracting and retaining outstanding executive leadership. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>Source of Awards.  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Awards will be granted under the In Focus Systems 1998 Stock Incentive Plan. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>Program Effective Date.  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject to shareholder approval of the 1998 Stock Incentive Plan, the Program will be effective April&nbsp;22, 1998. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>Eligibility.  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All elected officers and directors shall be eligible to participate in the Program. Appointed officers shall be eligible to participate with Board approval. All
directors elected at the 1998 Shareholders meeting shall be eligible for the Initial Match (defined below). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>Matching Provisions.  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Initial Match.</I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effective April&nbsp;23, 1998 (the "Initial Match Date"), the Company will issue to
an eligible officer or director ("Participant") one share of Company stock, subject to the restrictions described below ("Restricted Stock"), for every two shares of Company stock (rounded up to the
nearest whole share) that were purchased by the Participant between January&nbsp;1, 1996 and the Initial Match Date and beneficially owned by such Participant, as of the close of business on the
Initial Match Date (shares of Company stock that are matched pursuant to this Program are hereinafter referred to as "Matched Shares"). The Restricted Stock will be held at a location determined by
the Company. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For
purposes of this Program, the term "purchase" means any acquisition of Shares pursuant to the exercise of any stock option awarded to the Participant under one or more stock option
or incentive plan of the Company, or any open market purchase that has been pre-approved by the Compliance Officer. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For
purposes of this Program, the term "beneficial ownership" shall have the same meaning given to that term for purposes of preparing the beneficial ownership table in the Company's
proxy statement for its annual meeting of shareholders. </FONT></P>

Company stock (rounded up to the nearest whole share) that are purchased by the Participant between April&nbsp;23, 1998 and December&nbsp;31, 1998 and beneficially owned by such Participant, as of
the close of business of the business day on which the shares are purchased (the "Match Date"), provided, however, that the aggregate number of shares of Restricted Stock granted to any one
Participant during such period shall not exceed 5,000 shares (the "Match Cap"). Shares of Restricted Stock awarded under this Program shall be issued on the applicable Match Date. </FONT></P>

date on which the Board of Directors approves the issuance of such Restricted Stock; provided, however, that the aggregate number of shares of Restricted Stock granted to any one Participant for
purchases made during calendar year 1999 shall not exceed 5,000 shares. Issuance of shares of Restricted Stock shall be subject to approval by the Board of Directors and determination by the Board
that issuance of such shares will not constitute a violation, on the part of the Company or the Participant, of applicable federal securities laws. The Board shall review and approve the issuance of
Restricted Stock at its regularly scheduled meetings in April, July, October and December, 1999 and January, 2000. Shares of Restricted Stock approved for issuance by the Board of Directors shall be
issued on the date such approval is granted. In the event a Participant notifies the Company that he/she intends to make an IRC Section&nbsp;83 election following a qualifying purchase, the Company
will seek to obtain Board of Directors approval of the issuance of Restricted Stock as soon as practicable following receipt of such notification. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2000</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continuation of the program in future years will be subject to further Board review and approval. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>Restriction Period.  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each share of Restricted Stock will vest at the end of the three (3)&nbsp;year period, commencing on the date the Participant makes the qualifying purchase, of
the Participant's continuous service as an elected or appointed officer or director of the Company; provided, however, that if the Participant does not continue to hold his or her Matched Shares at
the end of such period, the portion of the Participant's Restricted Stock that bears the same ratio as the Matched Shares that the Participant does not continue to hold at the end of such period bears
to the total Matched Shares shall vest at the end of the nine (9)&nbsp;year period of the Participant's continuous service as an elected or appointed officer or director of the Corporation. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Participant will provide the Company with documentation demonstrating that he/she beneficially owns the Matched Shares at the end of the three year period in order for the Restricted
Shares to vest. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For
this purpose, a Participant shall "continue to hold" his or her Matched Shares if such shares remain beneficially owned by such Participant at all times, and are not sold, assigned,
or pledged (as collateral for a loan, or as security for the performance of an obligation, or for any other purpose) to any person at any time, during the applicable period. Additionally, Officers are
required to hold their Matched Shares at the Company-approved Broker in order to meet the 'continue to hold' requirement. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For
this purpose, a Participant shall "continue to serve as an elected or appointed officer or director of the Company" if such person remains an elected or appointed officer or director
of the Company or its subsidiaries at all times during the applicable period. Company approved medical leave shall not be considered an interruption of service. Shares of unvested Restricted Stock
shall be forfeited by a
Participant at such time as the Participant fails to continue to serve as an elected or appointed officer or director of the Company, provided, however, that in the event of a Participant's death, all
unvested Restricted Stock shall immediately vest. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>Tendering of Match Shares for Option Exercises (Effective October&nbsp;18, 2000).  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Participant will be considered to "continue to hold" Matched Shares that are tendered to the Company in payment of the exercise price of stock options (a
"Subsequent Exercise"). In such a case, however, the number of shares of Restricted Stock otherwise issuable under the Officer and Director Stock Ownership Program upon the Subsequent Exercise shall
be reduced by a number of shares equal to one-half the number of Matched Shares tendered to pay the exercise price. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>Acceleration of Vesting.  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board of Directors may accelerate the vesting of any or all Restricted Stock at any time and for any reason. Any unvested Restricted Stock will become fully
vested immediately prior to </FONT></P>
