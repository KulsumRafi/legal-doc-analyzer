      -     Marketing activities including approving marketing budgets,
            reviewing marketing proposals, monitoring high profile contract

      -     Miscellaneous activities including monitoring human resources and

      -     Such other duties as from time to time requested by me.

-     Start Date. Your employment by GenCorp as President of GDX Automotive is
      contingent upon your obtaining a non-immigrant visa and your executing an
      agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit "A" hereto terminating the
      Managing Director Agreement dated 17 October 2001 between you and GDX
      Automotive Technical Center GmbH & Co. KG. Your start date of employment
      by GenCorp will be effective on the issue date of your non-immigrant visa
      at a consulate abroad. GenCorp will sponsor you for a non-immigrant visa,
      but undertakes no obligation to sponsor you for an immigrant visa.

-     Salary. Your monthly base salary will be $21,666.67, an annualized salary
      of $260,000.

-     Annual Bonus. You will be eligible to participate in GenCorp's annual
      incentive plan, beginning with GenCorp's 2002 fiscal year. Your maximum
      incentive opportunity will be 100% of your annual base salary. Annual
      incentive payments are payable in January or February following the end of
      GenCorp's fiscal year and in accordance with GenCorp's regular pay
      practices and discretion of the CEO. In accordance with the Executive
      Incentive Compensation Program, payment of bonuses is contingent upon your
      continued employment by GenCorp on the date of payment.

-     Stock Options. You will participate in the stock option program under the
      GenCorp 1999 Equity and Performance Incentive Plan, subject to the vesting
      requirements in effect on the date of the option grant. Grants typically
      are made on an annual basis, although the frequency of grants is subject
      to the discretion of the CEO and the Board of Directors. The number of
      stock options granted is based on competitive norms associated with base
      salary, subject to management's judgment of the individual's performance
      and potential.

      On your start date, you will be granted options to purchase 40,000 shares
      of GenCorp Common Stock. The options will vest one-third on each of the
      first, second, and third anniversaries of your start date, and the option
      price will be the closing price of GenCorp common stock on the New York
      Stock Exchange on your start date.

-     Restricted Stock. You will be eligible to participate in the long term
      incentive program under the 1999 Equity and Performance Incentive Plan in
      whatever form is approved by the Board of Directors beginning in FY 2002.
      In recent years, key executives received grants of restricted stock, which
      vest if specified performance goals are achieved.

      Subject to approval of the Board of Directors, as required, you will be
      granted 15,000 restricted shares of GenCorp Common Stock on your start
      date. Provided that you remain in the continuous employ of GenCorp, the
      restriction on these shares will lapse three years from your start date.

-     Severance Agreement. Subject to approval of the Board of Directors, you
      will be offered a Severance Agreement containing the standard terms and
      conditions applicable to GenCorp Officers, which provides benefits in the
      event of a "change in control".

-     Pension. You will automatically participate in the GenCorp Consolidated
      Pension Plan. Participation in this plan does not require employee
      contributions and your accrued benefit fully vests after five years of
      service with GenCorp.

-     401(k). You will be eligible to participate in the GenCorp Retirement
      Savings Plan. The plan provides a 100% matching contribution up to the

      contributions vest immediately and are invested in the GenCorp Stock Fund.

-     Benefit Restoration Plan. You will also participate in the company benefit
      restoration plan. The purpose of this plan is to restore 401(k)
      contributions and pension benefits that you would otherwise lose because
      of certain Internal Revenue Code limitations on participation in such
      plans.

-     Financial Counseling. You will be eligible for individual financial
      counseling. GenCorp has entered into an agreement with AYCO to provide
      this service. If you elect to participate, your cost will be 10% of the
      annual fees charged by AYCO. You will incur an income tax liability on
      imputed income resulting from GenCorp's payment of its share of AYCO's
      fees.

      area, we are offering you relocation benefits including reimbursement of
      your home sale expenses, shipment and/or storage of household goods, a

-     Vacation. You will be eligible for four (4) weeks of paid vacation
      commencing on your start date.
