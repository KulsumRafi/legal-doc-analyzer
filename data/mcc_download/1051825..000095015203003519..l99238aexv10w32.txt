                                   AGREEMENT


     This Agreement ("Agreement") is made and entered into this __ day of
_______, 2003 between CART, Inc., a Michigan corporation, having its place of
business at 5350 Lakeview Parkway South Drive, Indianapolis, IN 46268 ("CART")
and Newman/Haas Racing, 500 Tower Pkwy., Lincolnshire, IL 60069 ("TEAM").


                              W I T N E S S E T H:

     WHEREAS, CART has sanctioned the Bridgestone Presents the Champ Car World
Series Powered by Ford ("Championship Series") in 2003 ("Race Year");

     WHEREAS, CART desires to induce TEAM to enter a race car exclusively in the
Championship Series in the Race Year and TEAM is interested in entering a race
car upon the terms and conditions set forth herein;

     WHEREAS, CART desires to obtain endorsement and promotional services, and
TEAM is willing to advertise and promote the Championship Series on the terms
and conditions hereafter set forth; and

     WHEREAS, the parties desire to establish a mutually beneficial relationship
in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth herein.

     NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and mutual covenants set
forth herein, the parties agree as follows:

      1. TEAM shall prepare and enter and expend its mutual efforts to qualify
         and race one (1) race car exclusively in the Championship Series, in
         all of the races in the Race Year.

      2. In consideration for TEAM's agreement to race in each of the races, and
         in consideration of TEAM's providing promotional benefits through
         advertising on the race car and other below enumerated promotional
         services, CART agrees to pay TEAM the sum of One Million
         ($1,000,000.00) Dollars during the 2003 race season. The payments will
         be made in twenty (20) equal installments. The payments shall be made
         during the week following each of the races in the race season. If
         there are less than twenty (20) races in the race season, the monies
         remaining after the last race of the season shall be paid in a lump
         sum.

      3. TEAM understands that the payment of the funds set forth in paragraph 2
         above is intended to supplement TEAM's revenue so that TEAM has enough
         funding to field a team during the Race year. In the event that TEAM
         receives net sponsorship revenue that totals more than Six Million Five
         Hundred ($6,500,000.00) Dollars, TEAM will reimburse CART fifty (50%)
         percent of all excess amounts until CART has been reimbursed the amount
         set forth in paragraph 2 above. For purposes of this Agreement, net
         sponsorship revenue shall include all amounts given to TEAM under this
         Agreement and the Entrant Support and Participation Agreement and

         reduced by commissions paid and out of pocket expenses required by the
         sponsorship contract. In addition, any refund to CART will be reduced
         by expenses incurred by TEAM under paragraph 5. So long as this
         Agreement remains in effect, and for a period of one (1) year
         thereafter, TEAM agrees to maintain complete and accurate books and
         records containing information necessary to calculate the amount of
         sponsorship funds connected. Upon at least ten (10) days written notice
         by CART, TEAM shall allow its books and records to be examined and
         audited by CART at reasonable times.

         an interest in TEAM and that he would not be involved in the decision
