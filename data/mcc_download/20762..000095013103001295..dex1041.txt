Dear Mr. Allen:

                      This Amended and Restated Letter Agreement (the "Amended
Letter"), effective as of the date hereof sets forth the terms and conditions of
your relationship with Premcor Inc. ("Premcor").

1.   Board Appointment.

     (a) Position. Commencing upon the effectiveness of the Written Consent of
the Stockholders of Premcor Inc. dated January 30, 2002, Blackstone agreed to
cause you to be appointed to, and you hereby agree to serve on, the Board of
Directors of Premcor (the "Board"). You hereby agree to serve on the Board for
three consecutive years commencing on such date of effectiveness, subject to any
applicable nomination and voting; provided, however, that you may resign from
the Board for reasons of conscience or substantial good cause.

     (b) Compensation. In addition to any director fees equal to those received
by other independent directors, upon commencement of your board membership,
Premcor shall grant you stock options to purchase 100,000 shares of Premcor
common stock at an exercise price equal to $10 per share (the "Initial
Options"). Subject to your continued service on the Board, such Initial Options
will vest in equal installments on each of the first three anniversaries of the
date of grant, and will become fully vested upon the occurrence of a Change in
Control (as defined in Premcor's 2002 Equity Incentive Plan (the "Plan")). Other
terms and conditions of the Initial Options shall be as set forth herein, in the
Plan and in an option agreement between you and Premcor.

     (c) Restrictions. All shares acquired by exercise of the Initial Options
and the Matching Options (as defined below) shall be subject to (x) standard
lock-up restrictions as recommended by the underwriter following Premcor's
Initial Public Offering (as defined below) and any subsequent sales of shares of
common stock to the public.

maintain directors and officers liability insurance.

2.   Initial Public Offering.

     (a) Purchased Shares. Premcor contemplates an initial public offering of
shares of common stock pursuant to an effective registration statement filed

Securities Act.

     (b) Matching Options. For each of the Purchased Shares so purchased, you

an exercise price equal to the price per share you paid for the Purchased Shares
(the "Matching Options"). Subject to your continued service on the Board, such
Matching Options will vest in equal installments on each of the first three
anniversaries of the date of grant, and will become fully vested upon the
occurrence of a Change in Control of Premcor. Other terms and conditions of the
Matching Options shall be as set forth herein, in the Plan and in an option
agreement between you and Premcor.

3.   Miscellaneous.

("Confidential Information") and shall not at any time disclose, retain, or use
such Confidential Information for your own benefit or the benefit of any other
person, without the written authorization of the Board; provided that the
foregoing shall not apply to the extent that information is required to be
disclosed by law.
