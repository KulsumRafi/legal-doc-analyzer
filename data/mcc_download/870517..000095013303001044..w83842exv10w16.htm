</FONT>

<P><FONT size="2">This Retirement and Consulting Agreement is made as of this 6th day of
December, 2002, by and between MBNA Corporation, a Maryland corporation with

hereinafter the &#147;Corporation&#148;), and Charles M. Cawley (the &#147;Executive&#148;).
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">The Executive founded MBNA America Bank, N.A., (the &#147;Bank&#148;), the Corporation&#146;s
principal subsidiary, in 1982 and has served for many years as the leader of
the Corporation and the Bank, serving as President and director of the
Corporation since its formation and initial public offering in 1991 and most
recently as its Chief Executive Officer, and serving as Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer of the Bank from 1991 to 2002 and President from 1985 to
2002.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">In consideration of the Executive&#146;s long standing service and leadership, the
Corporation desires to provide certain benefits to the Executive following his
retirement from the Corporation. In addition, the Corporation desires to
continue to have the exclusive benefit of the Executive&#146;s advice, counsel and
services following his retirement.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">In consideration of the above matters and for other good and valuable
consideration, the sufficiency of which each of the parties acknowledge, the
Corporation and the Executive, intending to be legally bound hereby, agree to
the following terms and conditions.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consulting Services.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">Following the Executive&#146;s retirement from the Corporation, the Executive agrees
to be available to provide such consulting services to the Corporation as may
be reasonably requested by the Corporation. The terms of such consulting
services, including the scope, times and compensation, shall be as mutually
agreed to by the Corporation and the Executive.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Post-Retirement Benefits.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">Beginning on the Executive&#146;s retirement date, and continuing for the remainder
of the Executive&#146;s life, the Corporation agrees to provide the Executive with
the benefits described below. Upon the death of the Executive, the Corporation
agrees to provide these same benefits to the Executive&#146;s spouse for the
remainder of the spouse&#146;s life.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp; Office and Administrative Support. The Corporation will provide at
its expense an office, including furnishings and equipment, comparable to the
Executive&#146;s principle office at the Corporation immediately prior to his
retirement. Such office will be at a Corporation facility selected by the
Executive. The Corporation will also provide at its expense a full time
assistant and a full time secretary selected by and reporting to the Executive.
Such assistant and secretary shall be employed by the Corporation, with

<H5 align="left" style="page-break-before:always">&nbsp;</H5><P>
<P><FONT size="2">compensation and benefits comparable to those provided to the Executive&#146;s staff
immediately prior to his retirement, and with periodic increases in
compensation and benefits comparable to those provided to other administrative
staff for senior executives at the Corporation.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp; Security Services. The Corporation will provide to the Executive and
maintain and monitor at its expense home security systems (including
appropriate fencing and gates, lighting and alarms) at each of the Executive&#146;s
personal residences comparable to the existing security services provided to
the Executive, or if greater, the security services provided to the Executive
immediately prior to his retirement. The Corporation will provide to the
Executive a driver trained in personal protection and acceptable to the
Executive in his sole discretion for personal travel at such times as the
Executive may request.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp; Airplane Use. The Corporation will permit the Executive to use
corporate aircraft (owned or leased by the Corporation at its expense) for all
corporate business travel and for all personal travel, including personal
travel of members of the Executive&#146;s family and others chosen by the Executive
(whether or not the Executive is on the flight), at any times and for travel to
any destination the Executive chooses. The Corporation need not make an
aircraft available for the Executive&#146;s exclusive use and may provide an
aircraft that is suitable for the particular travel and number of passengers
chosen in size and range, provided that the aircraft is a jet and not smaller
than any corporate aircraft (owned or leased by the Corporation). The
Executive agrees to give at least 12 hours notice of any travel for which the
Executive requests a corporate aircraft, except for travel in response to a
personal emergency. The Corporation will pay the cost for all corporate
business and personal use. The Executive will reimburse the Corporation for
all personal use attributed to the Executive in excess of $250,000 per calendar
year (pro rated for the first calendar year if the Executive&#146;s retirement does
not begin on or about the start of a calendar year). For purposes of this
Agreement, the cost of personal use will be determined using applicable IRS
methods and rates. For purposes of calculating the above $250,000 threshold,
no cost will be included for a person accompanying at the request of the
Corporation an executive traveling on business, notwithstanding that under IRS
requirements the Corporation would be required to impute income to the
executive for the person&#146;s travel.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp; Medical Benefits. The Corporation will provide, at its cost, to the
Executive until age 65 and his spouse until age 65 the medical benefits
provided to employees of the Corporation generally. The Corporation will
provide, at its cost, to the Executive after age 65 and his spouse after age 65
Medicare supplemental health insurance coverage.

under this Agreement (the &#147;Restricted Period&#148;), unless otherwise agreed in
writing by the Corporation, the Executive will not, directly or indirectly, in
any capacity (including as director, officer, employee, stockholder, partner,
owner, consultant or advisor) provide

prior and contemporaneous agreements and understandings, relative to the same

Agreement, and this agreement concerning the term &#147;competition&#148; shall survive
any termination of this Agreement.

<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp; This Agreement may not be amended or changed, and neither party shall
be deemed to have waived any provision of this Agreement, unless the amendment
or change or waiver is set forth in a writing signed by a duly authorized
officer of the Corporation and by the Executive. The failure of either party
to enforce any term of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of any
rights or deprive the party of the right to insist thereafter upon strict
adherence to that or any other term of this Agreement, nor shall a waiver of
any breach of this Agreement constitute a waiver of any preceding or succeeding
breach.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp; The Executive acknowledges that the Executive has read and
understands each provision of this Agreement and has had an opportunity for
counsel of the Executive&#146;s choice to review this Agreement and that no promises
or inducements have been made for the Executive to sign this Agreement except
as expressly set forth in this Agreement.

Delaware, without regard to principles of conflicts of laws.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp; The Executive agrees that any breach by the Executive of any
provision of Section&nbsp;3 or Section&nbsp;4 of this Agreement would cause the
Corporation irreparable damage and that no remedy available at law would be
adequate for such violation. Accordingly, in addition to any other remedies
available at law or in equity or under any Corporation benefit or compensation
plan or this Agreement, the Corporation may immediately seek enforcement of
this Agreement in a court of appropriate jurisdiction by means of specific
performance or injunction, without posting of a bond, or otherwise.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)&nbsp; It is the intention of the parties that this Agreement shall be
enforceable to the fullest extent allowed by law. In the event that a court
holds any provision of Section&nbsp;3 or Section&nbsp;4 of this Agreement to be
unenforceable, the parties agree that, if allowed by law, that provision shall
be reduced to the degree necessary to render it enforceable without affecting
the rest of this Agreement, and, if such reduction is not allowed by law, the
parties shall promptly agree in writing to a provision to be substituted
therefor which will have an effect as close as possible to the invalid
provision that is consistent with applicable law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement shall not affect or limit
the validity and enforceability of the other provisions hereof.
