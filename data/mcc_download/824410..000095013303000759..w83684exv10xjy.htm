Claims and Review Procedures</B>

writing, within ninety days of his or her written application for benefits, of
his or her eligibility or noneligibility for benefits under the Agreement. If
the Bank determines that the beneficiary is not eligible for benefits or full
benefits, the notice shall set forth (a)&nbsp;the specific reasons for such denial,
(b)&nbsp;a specific reference to the provisions of the Agreement on which the denial
is based, (c)&nbsp;a description of any additional information or material necessary
for the claimant to perfect his or her claim, and a description of why it is
needed, and (d)&nbsp;an explanation of the Agreement&#146;s claims review procedure and
other appropriate information as to the steps to be taken if the beneficiary
wishes to have the claim reviewed. If the Bank determines that there are
special circumstances requiring additional time to make a decision regarding
eligibility for benefits, the Bank shall notify the beneficiary of the special
circumstances and the date by which a decision is expected to be made, and may
extend the time by which notice may be given of such decision for up to an
additional ninety-day period.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.2 <I>Review Procedure. </I>If the beneficiary is determined by the Bank not to be
eligible for benefits, or if the beneficiary believes that he or she is
entitled to greater or different benefits, the beneficiary shall have the
opportunity to have such claim reviewed by the Bank by filing a petition for
review with the Bank within sixty days after receipt of the notice issued by
the Bank. Such petition shall state the specific reasons that the beneficiary
believes entitle him or her to benefits or to greater or different benefits.
Within sixty days after receipt by the Bank of the petition, the Bank shall
afford the beneficiary (and counsel, if any) an opportunity to present his or
her position to the Bank orally or in writing, and the beneficiary (or counsel)
shall have the right to review the pertinent documents. The Bank shall notify
the beneficiary of its decision in writing within the sixty-day period, stating
specifically the basis of its decision, written in a manner calculated to be
understood by the beneficiary, and the specific provisions of the Agreement on
which the decision is based. If, because of the need for a hearing, the
sixty-day period is not sufficient, notice of such decision may be deferred for
up to another sixty-day period at the election of the Bank, but notice of this
deferral shall be given to the beneficiary.

contract. It does not give the Executive the right to remain an employee of

Executive. It also does not require the Executive to remain an employee nor
interfere with the Executive&#146;s right to terminate employment at any time.

creditors. The Insurance Policy and any other insurance on the Executive&#146;s life

neither the Executive nor any beneficiary has any preferred or secured claim of
any kind, and does not represent funding for the benefit under this Agreement.
Any representation or assertion contrary to this section 8.6 is a material
breach of this Agreement by the representing or asserting party, which, if such
party is the Executive or, following his death, a beneficiary, shall
immediately result in the cessation of any and all payments and the elimination
of any liability hereunder for any payment not made prior to such assertion or
representation, and, if such party is the Bank, shall subject it to liability
for actual damages for such breach.

the permission of the Bank, during the two years immediately following the
Executive&#146;s Termination of Employment, the Executive shall not serve as an
