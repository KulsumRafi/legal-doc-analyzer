Household or its Affiliates shall own the Accounts and, subject to the terms and
conditions of the Purchase and Sale Agreement, shall bear the credit risk for
such Accounts.  Household shall not be obligated to take any action under an

COMPENSATION, SETTLEMENT, AND FUNDING</P>
<P>Section 3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;
<A NAME="_Toc31557272"><U>Acceptance, Offset and
Funding</U>.</A></P>
</B><P>Subject to the terms, conditions, warranties and representations in this
Agreement and provided that Merchant has satisfied all of the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, Household agrees to pay to Merchant the amount of each
valid and authorized Sales Slip or Card Sale presented to Household during the
term of this Agreement, less the amount of the fees, charges, and discounts
described below, outstanding Account balances for Sales Slips subject to
Chargeback, reimbursements, refunds, customer credits and any other amounts owed
to Household by Merchant under this Agreement.  Household may also offset or
recoup said amounts from amounts owed to Merchant under this Agreement on the
date such payment from Merchant to Household is due and payable.  Any amounts
owed by Merchant to Household that cannot be paid by the aforesaid means shall
be due and payable by Merchant on demand.  Subject to Merchant's right to
dispute in good faith any amounts owed Household under this Agreement and
provided that Merchant is actively pursuing such dispute, if Merchant fails or
refuses to pay any amounts owed to Household under this Agreement after
Household provides thirty (30) days' notice to Merchant, Household may cease
authorizations for and the funding or acceptance of any Sales Slips or Card
Sales or the processing of applications for an Account.  Any payment made by
either party to the other party shall not be final but shall be subject to
subsequent review and verification by such other party.  Household's liability
to Merchant with respect to the funding or processing of any Card Sale, Sales
Slip or Credit Slip shall not exceed the amount on the Sales Slip or Credit Slip
in connection with such transaction.  In no event shall either party be liable
for any incidental or consequential damages.  Merchant shall deliver to
Household a daily settlement sheet by 11:00 a.m. Central time, on the first
Business Day following the date covered by each such sheet.  The form of such
daily settlement sheet shall be mutually agreed to by the parties.  From and
after the Conversion Date, funding of each day's net daily settlement amount
shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account
designated by the party receiving such payment no later than 3:00 p.m. Central
time on the Business Day on which the daily settlement sheet is provided
pursuant to this Section 3.1 if the transmission of such previous day's
transactions is received by 6:00 a.m. Central Time; provided, that if the
transmission is received later than 6:00 a.m. Central Time, then funding shall
occur on the first (1<SUP>st</SUP>) Business Day after said transmission.  In
addition to any other rights and remedies available to a party under this
Agreement, in the event that the party obligated to make payment hereunder fails
to make any such funding payment by the time required herein (which failure is
caused by a factor within such party's control), and such delay results in the
party receiving such payment being unable to invest such funds overnight, the
next day's daily settlement sheet shall include interest on such delayed payment
amount (plus such delayed payment amount if such amount shall have not been
paid), calculated on the basis of an interest rate equal to the Federal Funds
Interest Rate, divided by three hundred and sixty (360) for each day such amount
is overdue. </P>
<P>Merchant acknowledges and agrees that (i) Household is paying Merchant for
Sales Slips in advance before Household can determine whether such Sales Slips
are subject to Chargeback, (ii) as a result, Household's payment to Merchant is
conditioned upon, and in reliance on, Merchant's agreement to permit Household
to recoup Chargebacks and other overpayments from fundings payable to Merchant
under this Agreement for subsequently presented Sale Slips, and (iii) due to the
ongoing reconciliation process implemented under this Agreement, the reduction
of current fundings by the amount of Chargebacks and other amounts owing by
Merchant to Household constitutes a single integrated transaction.</P>


<B><P>Section 3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;
<A NAME="_Toc31557273"><U>Discounts</U>.</A></P>
</B><P>Each Sales Slip or Card Sale generated pursuant to a regular plan or
Promotional Credit Plan shall be subject to a discount fee as set forth herein.
The initial discount fees shall be as follows:</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER><TABLE CELLSPACING=0 BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=7 WIDTH=416>

</TR>
</TABLE>
</CENTER></P>

<P>The Promotional Credit Plan discount fees shall be adjusted based upon
changes in Base LIBOR and shall be determined annually on each anniversary of
the Effective Date beginning with the first anniversary of the Effective Date of
this Agreement (the &quot;Adjustment Date&quot;).  The &quot;Adjustment&quot;
shall be equal to the result of a multiplier (&quot;Multiplier&quot;) multiplied
by the difference, if any, in the LIBOR determined as of the Adjustment Date
(&quot;Current LIBOR&quot;) from Base LIBOR (&quot;LIBOR Spread&quot;).  The
Multiplier will be equal to 0.2 for a 3-month promotion and 0.4 for a 6-month
promotion.  The Current LIBOR shall be determined by the average LIBOR for the
month prior to the Adjustment Date.  The new Promotional Credit Plan discount
fee shall be effective as to all Promotional Credit Plan volume accepted and
funded by Household for the next 12 months starting the month immediately after
the applicable Adjustment Date.  The new Promotional Credit Plan discount fee
shall be determined by adding or subtracting the Adjustment to or from the
initial Promotional Credit Plan discount fee for each Promotional Credit Plan.
For example, if the Current LIBOR on the Adjustment Date is 1.66% and Base LIBOR
was 1.56%, the Promotional Credit Plan discount fee for a 6 Month Same as
Cash/Delayed Monthly payment (&quot;6 Month SAC/DMP) Promotional Credit Plan for
a sale amount of $1,000 would be calculated as follows: 1.66% (Current LIBOR)
minus 1.56% (Base LIBOR) = .10% (LIBOR Spread); .4 (Multiplier for a 6 month
promotion) times .10% (LIBOR Spread) = .04% (Adjustment).  2.90% (6 Month
SAC/DMP Promotional Credit Plan for sale amount of $1,000 discount fee) + .04%
(Adjustment) = 2.94% (new discount fee for 6 Month SAC DMP Promotional Credit
Plan for sale amount of $1,000).</P>
<P>Merchant shall be entitled to a refund of the discount fees if the Card Sale
is canceled or the Goods are returned or canceled within thirty (30) days of the
date of the Card Sale.  Merchant shall not be entitled to a refund of the
discount fees if the Card Sale is canceled or the Goods are returned or canceled
thirty (30) days or more after the date of the Card Sale.</P>

<B><P>Section 3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;
<A NAME="_Toc31557274"><U>Program Fee</U>.</A></P>
</B><P>The Program Fee (as defined in the Fee Letter) payable by Household to
Merchant under this Agreement and the circumstances under which such fee will be
paid is set forth in the Fee Letter, dated the date hereof, between Merchant and
Household (the &quot;Fee Letter&quot;).</P>

<B><P>Section 3.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;
<A NAME="_Toc31557275"><U>Other Revenue</U>.</A></P>
</B><P>The Other Revenue (as defined in the Fee Letter) payable by Household to
Merchant under this Agreement and the circumstances under which such amounts
will be paid is set forth in the Fee Letter, dated the date hereof, between
Merchant and Household (the &quot;Fee Letter&quot;).</P>

<B><P>Section 3.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;
<A NAME="_Toc31557276"><U>Sales, Gross Receipts and Privilege Tax
Refunds, Deductions and/or Credits</U>.</A></P>
</B><P>Merchant agrees that Household may, at its own expense, file refunds
(&quot;Refunds&quot;) or deductions, credits, amended returns or audit offsets

are sometimes referred to as &quot;Claims&quot;) during the term with respect to
sales tax, gross receipts tax, transaction privilege tax, or other similar tax
imposed on sales of tangible property attributable to any Accounts in states
(and local jurisdictions) designated by Household (i) the balances of which have
been charged off by Household for federal income tax purposes, (ii) which were
or are owned by Household, and (iii) which were originated with customers of
Merchant who financed their retail purchases through Household.  Except as is

without recourse.  In the event Household files for Refunds or claims Credits,
Merchant shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide Household within
sixty (60) days of Household's written request all information reasonably
requested by Household to support or verify the Claims, including but not

California or any other state that requires an election form to be filed as a
condition to receiving a Refund, Merchant agrees to provide and execute an
election form in the form attached as Exhibit&nbsp;A or in such other form as is
required by Household or the California State Board of Equalization or other
state regarding Merchant.  Household shall be entitled to retain 100% of all

techniques to assist the parties in reaching a resolution.  The costs of such
mediation shall be shared equally by the parties.  If the Dispute is not

of this Agreement.  Any award made by the Arbitrator(s) shall be binding on the
parties.  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, either party at any time may
require that a matter in dispute be submitted directly to arbitration,
irrespective of whether negotiation or mediation has been attempted or
completed.</P>
<P>(d)&#9;Such arbitration shall be held at New York, New York.</P>
<P>(e)&#9;The Arbitrator(s) shall have the authority, taking into account the
parties' desire that any arbitration proceeding hereunder be reasonably

discovery shall be (i)&nbsp;guided generally by and be no broader than permitted
under the United States Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and (ii)&nbsp;subject
