<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Any care certified by the utilization review specialist as medically necessary and appropriate will be considered to meet the medical necessity requirement of the Plan's definition of a "Covered Expense."&nbsp; Precertification does not verify, authorize or guarantee the payment of any benefits under the Plan.&nbsp; Benefit payments are subject to all Plan provisions, including eligibility rules, Covered Expenses, and exclusions.&nbsp; If precertification is not obtained, the Plan will obtain a retrospective determination of the medical necessity and appropriateness of the services.&nbsp; Thus, if you do not contact the utilization review specialist to precertify services, you run the risk of discovering, after you receive services, that they are not considered medically necessary and are, therefore, not covered under the Plan.&nbsp; In that case, you may be entirely responsible for the&nbsp;cost of such noncovered services.&nbsp; Although utilization review is voluntary and there is no penalty if you choose not to participate, you are encouraged to take advantage of this program.&nbsp; </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you chose to precertify an inpatient Hospital admission, the utilization review specialist will perform periodic reviews during your Hospital stay of your medical progress and will check with your Physician and the Hospital.&nbsp; The purpose of these reviews is to continue certification that you are not being kept in the Hospital longer than is medically necessary.&nbsp; Coverage of any days of inpatient hospitalization that are determined by the utilization review organization, either prospectively or retrospectively, not to be medically necessary and appropriate is limited to what care would have cost had it been provided on an outpatient basis.&nbsp; </P>

<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">REIMBURSEMENT</B> &nbsp;--&nbsp; Whenever the Plan makes payment for covered expenses in a total amount that exceeds, at any time, the maximum amount of payment necessary to satisfy the intent of this Appendix, the Trustees shall have the right to recover such payments, to the extent of such excess, from any person or plan to, for, or with respect to whom such payments were made or transferred or any other person or plan, in any combination.&nbsp; Alternatively, the Trustees may set off the amount of such payments, to the extent of such excess, against any amount owing, at that time or in the future, to any person or plan to, for, or with respect to whom such payments were made or transferred or any other person or plan.&nbsp; </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For example, but not by way of limitation, if this Plan pays a claim of yours and the Trustees later determine that the claim was for an expense not covered under this Plan, then the Trustees are entitled to recover the payment from the you, a member of your family that is also covered under the Plan, and/or the person who provided your treatment, in any&nbsp;combination.&nbsp; Alternatively, the Trustees may set off the amount of the payment from amounts the Plan owes in the future to you, your covered family member, and/or the provider, in any combination.&nbsp; This same rule applies if the Plan pays a claim for a covered expense, but the amount paid exceeds the amount required to be paid under the Plan.&nbsp; </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This reimbursement provision applies, among other circumstances, where the Plan pays covered expenses incurred for treatment of an Injury or Illness for which any other person or plan is or may be liable, and where the Plan's subrogation provision (as described above) does not provide the Plan with a right to recover amounts it paid or pays.&nbsp; If the other person or plan, the other person or plan's insurer, or anyone else on behalf of the other person or plan makes payment to you or on your behalf as compensation for the your Injury or Illness, and this Plan is not subrogated with respect to the payment, the Plan is entitled to reimbursement in an amount equal to the lesser of (a) the benefits paid by this Plan for treatment of the Injury or Illness, or (b) the amount paid to you or on your behalf by the other person or plan.&nbsp; This reimbursement provision is inapplicable where the other person or plan is a medical plan with respect to which this Plan, pursuant to its coordination of benefits provisions, is the primary payer of the covered person's allowable expenses.&nbsp; </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition, where another person or plan pays compensation to you or on your behalf for an Injury or Illness for which the other person or plan is or may be liable, and you incur (either before or after payment of such compensation) otherwise covered expenses for treatment of the Injury or Illness, a special rule applies.&nbsp; In that case, any otherwise covered expenses that are incurred after the date on which the compensation was paid, or that were incurred before that date but not yet paid by the Plan as of that date, shall be excluded from coverage under the Plan (and therefore not paid by the Plan), to the extent that the amount of compensation you or your Dependent receives exceeds the amount of covered expenses the Plan has already paid for treatment of your Injury or Illness.&nbsp; </FONT></TD>
