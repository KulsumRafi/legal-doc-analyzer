                      "TRUST SPREAD ACCOUNT MAXIMUM" means, with respect to any
               Payment Date, an amount equal to the aggregate Note Interest
               Payment Amounts due with respect to the Notes during the
               seventeen month period immediately following such Payment Date,
               assuming no principal payments are made on the Notes during such
               seventeen month period following such Payment Date.

                      "TRUST SPREAD ACCOUNT RELEASE AMOUNT" means, with respect
               to any Payment Date with respect to which the Trust Spread
               Account Maximum has been reached, the lesser of (a) the balance

                      R  =   the balance on deposit in the Trust Spread
                             Account after deducting any amounts to be
                             transferred from the Trust Spread Account to the
                             Collection Account on such Payment Date pursuant to

                      T  =   7.91%; and

                             accounting for any payments of principal to be made
                             as a result of the receipt of distributions with
                             respect to the Underlying Certificates and before
                             payments from the Trust Spread Account;

               provided, however, the Trust Spread Account Release Amount shall
               not be less than zero and the balance in the Trust Spread Account
               shall not be reduced below the Trust Spread Account Minimum prior
               to the Payment Date on which the Outstanding Amount of the Notes
               is reduced to zero.
