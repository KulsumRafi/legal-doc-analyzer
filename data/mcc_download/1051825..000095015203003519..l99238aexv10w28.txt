     VI. DELIVERY AND RETURN OF ENGINES.

     CART will arrange with Cosworth for the delivery and return of all race

WARRANTY OF THE CAPACITY, CONDITION, SUITABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE, PERFORMANCE, RELIABILITY, USE, QUALITY OR MERCHANTABILITY FOR ANY
PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND ANY AND ALL SUCH REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES HEREBY
ARE WAIVED BY TEAM AND EXCLUDED FROM THIS AGREEMENT, IT BEING UNDERSTOOD AND
AGREED THAT THE SUPPLIED ITEMS ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "WITH ALL FAULTS." CART
SHALL NOT HAVE ANY OBLIGATION OR LIABILITY TO TEAM IN TORT, CONTRACT OR OTHER
THEORY FOR ANY LOSS, INJURY OR DAMAGE THROUGH TEAM, ITS EMPLOYEES, DRIVERS,
AGENTS OR CONTRACTORS AS A RESULT OF ANY DEFECT IN OR THE PROVISION FOR USE OF
ANY OF THE ITEMS WHICH ARE THE SUBJECT OF THIS AGREEMENT.

CART.

     TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, TEAM HEREBY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHTS
CONFERRED UPON A LESSEE AS PROVIDED IN STATE LAW.

     XI. RELEASE AND INDEMNIFICATION

     No officer or employee of CART will be liable to the Team in any
circumstances for any loss, expense or damage of any kind (direct, indirect,
financial or consequential and whether arising from negligence or otherwise)
arising from any act or omission of his during the performance of his employment
or other duties. All officers and employees of CART from time to time will be
entitled to the benefit of the exemptions, limitations, terms and conditions in
this Agreement, and for this purpose only CART enters into this Agreement as
their agent.

     The Team agrees that the risk of personal injury or death to individuals as
a result of racing the car powered by the Engine (whether a test or race) is
substantial but it is a normal and ordinary risk insured against by the Team.

     Team shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless, CART, its parent,
subsidiaries, and affiliated entities and the respective officers, directors,
shareholders, employees, agents, distributors, dealers, successors and assigns,
from and against any and all losses, claims, actions, suits, proceedings,
damages, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees, arising out of
or in connection with or related to the Team's racing and testing activities
including, without limitation, damage or injury to, or death of, any Team
employee, driver, agent or contractor; the performance or non-performance by or
any breach or default of, team under this agreement, including, but not limited
to, any of Team's testing or racing activities contemplated hereby, except that
Team's indemnification obligation hereunder shall not apply to any losses
resulting from the gross negligence or wilful misconduct of CART.

     The Parties recognise that the section is reasonable having regard to the
unique environment of CART racing and the totality of the commercial
arrangements between them including (without limitation) the amounts payable by
the Team to CART hereunder and to the fact that if CART were to accept
additional or more expensive liability than that prescribed in such clauses CART
would require to be paid, and the Team would agree to pay higher amounts.
