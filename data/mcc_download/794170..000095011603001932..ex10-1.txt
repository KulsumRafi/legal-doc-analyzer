         The sale of the Securities to the Initial Purchasers will be made

         In connection with the sale of the Securities, the Issuer and the

2002 (as amended or supplemented at the Execution Time, including any
information incorporated by reference therein, the "Preliminary Memorandum"),
and a final offering memorandum, dated November 15, 2002 (as amended or

reference therein, the "Final Memorandum"). Each of the Preliminary Memorandum
and the Final Memorandum sets forth certain information concerning the Issuer,
the Guarantors and the Securities. The Issuer and the Guarantors hereby confirm
that they have authorized the use of the Preliminary Memorandum and the Final
Memorandum, and any amendment or supplement thereto, in connection with the
offer and sale of the Securities by the Initial Purchasers. Unless stated to the
contrary, any references herein to the terms "amend," "amendment" or
"supplement" with respect to the Final Memorandum shall be deemed to refer to

Execution Time which is incorporated by reference therein.

         date, will not), contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
         omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements
         therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made,
         not misleading; provided, however, that the Issuer and the Company make
         no representation or warranty as to the information contained in or
         omitted from the Preliminary Memorandum or the Final Memorandum, or any
         amendment or supplement thereto, in reliance upon and in conformity

         require the registration of the Securities under the Act.

                  (e) Neither the Issuer and the Company, nor any of their
         respective Affiliates, nor any person acting on its or their behalf has

         material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of
         the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

         corporation, partnership, limited liability company or trust, as the
         case may be, in good standing (if applicable) under the laws of its
         jurisdiction of incorporation or formation, as the case may be (except
         where the failure to be in good standing would not result, individually
         or in the aggregate, in a Material Adverse Change). Each of the Company
         and its subsidiaries has full corporate or other organizational power
         and authority to own or lease, as the case may be (except where the
         failure to be in good standing would not result, individually or in the
         aggregate, in a Material Adverse Change), and to operate its properties
         and conduct its business as described in the Final Memorandum, and is
         duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation, partnership,
         limited liability company or trust, as the case may be, and is in good
         standing (if applicable) under the laws of each jurisdiction which
         requires such qualification (except where the failure to so qualify
         would not result, individually or in the aggregate, in a Material
         Adverse Change).

                  (m) All the outstanding shares of capital stock or outstanding
         interests of each subsidiary of the Company have been duly and validly
         authorized and issued and are fully paid and nonassessable, and, except
         as otherwise set forth in the Final Memorandum, all outstanding shares
         of capital stock or outstanding interests of such subsidiaries are
         owned by the Company either directly or through wholly owned
         subsidiaries free and clear of any perfected security interest or any
         other security interests, claims, liens or encumbrances.

         delivered by the Issuer and the Guarantors; the Indenture has been duly
         authorized and, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery
         thereof by the Trustee, when executed and delivered by the Issuer and
         the Guarantors, will constitute a legal, valid, binding instrument
         enforceable against the Issuer and the Guarantors in accordance with
         its terms (subject, as to the enforcement of remedies, to applicable
         bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium or other laws
         affecting creditors' rights generally from time to time in effect and
         to general principles of equity); the Securities have been duly

         authorized, and, when executed and authenticated in accordance with the
         provisions of the Indenture and delivered to and paid for by the
         Initial Purchasers, will have been duly executed and delivered by the
         Issuer and the Guarantors and will constitute the legal, valid and
         binding obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors, and be entitled
         to the benefits of the Indenture (subject, as to the enforcement of
         remedies, to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or other
         laws affecting creditors' rights generally from time to time in effect
         and to general principles of equity); and the Registration Rights
         Agreement has been duly authorized and, when executed and delivered by
         the Issuer and the Guarantors, will constitute the legal, valid,
         binding and enforceable instrument of the Issuer and the Guarantor
         (subject, as to the enforcement of remedies, to applicable bankruptcy,
         reorganization, insolvency, moratorium or other laws affecting
         creditors' rights generally from time to time in effect and to general
         principles of equity).

         of any court or governmental agency or body is required in connection
         with the transactions contemplated herein or in the Indenture or the

         the Act and the Trust Indenture Act and such as may be required under
         the blue sky laws of any jurisdiction in connection with the purchase
         and distribution of the Securities by the Initial Purchasers in the
         manner contemplated herein and in the Final Memorandum and the
         Registration Rights Agreement.

                  (p) None of the execution and delivery of the Indenture, this
         Agreement or the Registration Rights Agreement, the issue and sale of
         the Securities, or the consummation of any other of the transactions
         herein or therein contemplated, nor the fulfillment of the terms hereof
         or thereof will conflict with, result in a breach or violation of, or
         imposition of any lien, charge or encumbrance upon any property or
         assets of the Company or any of its subsidiaries pursuant to, (i) the
         charter, by-laws or other organizational documents of the Company or
         any of its subsidiaries; (ii) the terms of any indenture, contract,
         lease, mortgage, deed of trust, note agreement, loan agreement or other
         agreement, obligation, condition, covenant or instrument to which the
         Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or bound or to which its
         or their property is subject; or (iii) any statute, law, rule,
         regulation, judgment, order or decree applicable to the Company or any
         of its subsidiaries of any court, regulatory body, administrative
         agency, governmental body, arbitrator or other authority having
         jurisdiction over the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any of its
         respective properties (except in the cases of clauses (ii) and (iii)
         for such conflicts, breaches, violations, liens, charges or
         encumbrances that would not result, individually or in the aggregate,
         in a Material Adverse Change).

         schedules of the Company and its consolidated and consolidating
         subsidiaries incorporated by reference in the Final Memorandum present
         fairly in all material respects the financial condition, results of
         operations and cash flows of the Company as of the dates and for the
         periods indicated, comply as to form with the applicable accounting
         requirements of the Act and have been prepared in conformity with
         generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis

         Consolidated Financial Information and Operating Data" in the Final
         Memorandum fairly present, on the basis stated in the Final Memorandum,

         governmental agency, authority or body or any arbitrator involving the
         Company or any of its subsidiaries or its or their property is pending

         Agreement, or the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated
         hereby or thereby; or (ii) could reasonably be expected to result,

         of any indenture, contract, lease, mortgage, deed of trust, note
         agreement, loan agreement or other agreement, obligation, condition,

         property is subject; or (iii) any statute, law, rule, regulation,
         judgment, order or decree applicable to the Company or any of its

         over the Company or such subsidiary or any of its properties, as
         applicable (except in the cases of clauses (ii) and (iii) for such
         violations or defaults that would not result, individually or in the

         are independent public accountants with respect to the Company within
         the meaning of the Act and the applicable published rules and
         regulations thereunder.

                  (v) The Company has filed all foreign, federal, state and
         local tax returns that are required to be filed or has requested
         extensions thereof (except in any case in which the failure so to file
         would not result, individually or in the aggregate, in a Material
         Adverse Change), whether or not arising from transactions in the
         ordinary course of business, except as set forth in or contemplated in
         the Final Memorandum (exclusive of any amendment or supplement thereto)
         and has paid all taxes required to be paid by it and any other
         assessment, fine or penalty levied against it, to the extent that any
         of the foregoing is due and payable, except for any such assessment,
         fine or penalty that is currently being contested in good faith or as
         would not result, individually or in the aggregate, in a Material
         Adverse Change, whether or not arising from transactions in the
         ordinary course of business, except as set forth in or contemplated in
         the Final Memorandum (exclusive of any amendment or supplement
         thereto).

                  (w) No labor problem or dispute with the employees of the
         Company or any of its subsidiaries exists or, to the best knowledge of
         the Company, is threatened or imminent, and the Company is not aware of
         any existing or imminent labor disturbance by the employees of any of
         its or its subsidiaries' principal suppliers, contractors or customers,
         which problem, dispute or labor could result, individually or in the
         aggregate, in a Material Adverse Change, whether or not arising from
         transactions in the ordinary course of business, except as set forth in
         or contemplated in the Final Memorandum (exclusive of any amendment or
         supplement thereto).

                  (x) The Company and each of its subsidiaries are insured by
         insurers of recognized financial responsibility against such losses and
         risks and in such amounts as are prudent and customary in the
         businesses in which they are engaged; all policies of insurance and
         fidelity or surety bonds insuring the Company or any of its
         subsidiaries or their respective businesses, assets, employees,
         officers and directors are in full force and effect; the Company and
         its subsidiaries are in compliance with the terms of such policies and
         instruments in all material respects; and there are no claims by the
         Company or any of its subsidiaries under any such policy or instrument
         as to which any insurance company is denying liability or defending
         under a reservation of rights clause, which denials or defenses if
         resolved adversely to the Company would result, individually or in the
         aggregate, in a Material Adverse Change; neither the Company nor any
         such subsidiary has been refused any insurance coverage sought or
         applied for; and neither the Company nor any such subsidiary has any
         reason to believe that it will not be able to renew its existing
         insurance coverage as and when such coverage expires or to obtain
         similar coverage from similar insurers as may be necessary to continue
         its business at a cost that would not result, individually or in the


<PAGE>
                                      -8-

         aggregate, in a Material Adverse Change, whether or not arising from
         transactions in the ordinary course of business, except as set forth in
         or contemplated in the Final Memorandum (exclusive of any amendment or
         supplement thereto).

                  (y) Except for minimum capital requirements of law or
         contract, no subsidiary of the Company is currently prohibited,
         directly or indirectly, from paying any dividends to the Company, from
         making any other distribution on such subsidiary's capital stock, from
         repaying to the Company any loans or advances to such subsidiary from
         the Company or from transferring any of such subsidiary's property or
         assets to the Company or any other subsidiary of the Company, except as
         described in or contemplated by the Final Memorandum (exclusive of any
         amendment or supplement thereto).

                  (z) The Company and its subsidiaries possess all licenses,
         certificates, permits and other authorizations issued by the
         appropriate federal, state or foreign regulatory authorities necessary
         to conduct their respective businesses (except where the failure to
         possess such licenses, certificates, permits or other authorizations
         would not result, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
         Change) and neither the Company nor any such subsidiary has received
         any notice of proceedings relating to the revocation or modification of
         any such certificate, authorization or permit which, if the subject of
         an unfavorable decision, ruling or finding, would result, individually
         or in the aggregate, in a Material Adverse Change, whether or not
         arising from transactions in the ordinary course of business, except as
         set forth in or contemplated in the Final Memorandum (exclusive of any
         amendment or supplement thereto).

                  (aa) The Company maintains a system of internal accounting
         controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that, in reference
         to the Company and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, (i)
         transactions are executed in accordance with management's general or
         specific authorizations; (ii) transactions are recorded as necessary to
         permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
         accepted accounting principles and to maintain asset accountability;
         (iii) access to assets is permitted only in accordance with
         management's general or specific authorization; and (iv) the recorded
         accountability for assets is compared with the existing assets at
         reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to
         any differences.

         Any certificate signed by any officer of the Issuer and the Guarantors
and delivered to the Representatives or counsel for the Underwriters in
connection with the offering of the Securities shall be deemed a representation
and warranty by the Issuer and the Guarantors, as to matters covered thereby, to
each Initial Purchaser.

         2. Purchase and Sale. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions and in
reliance upon the representations and warranties herein set forth, the Issuer
agrees to sell to each Initial Purchaser, and each Initial Purchaser agrees,
severally and not jointly, to purchase from the Issuer, at a purchase price of
99.295% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued interest, if any, from
November 22, 2002 to the Closing Date, the principal amount of Notes set forth
opposite such Initial Purchaser's name in Schedule I hereto, which Notes shall
be endorsed with the Guarantees.

         (b) Delivery and Payment. Delivery of and payment for the Securities
shall be made at 10:00 A.M., New York City time, on November 22, 2002, or at
such time on such later date (not later than November 29, 2002) as the
Representatives shall designate, which date and time may be postponed by
agreement between the Representatives and the Issuer and the Company or as
provided in Section 8 hereof (such date and time of delivery and payment for the
Securities being herein called the "Closing Date"). Delivery of the Securities
shall be made to the Representatives for the respective accounts of the several
Initial Purchasers against payment by the several Initial Purchasers through the
Representatives of the purchase price thereof to or upon the order of the Issuer
and the Company by wire transfer payable in same-day funds to the account
specified by the Issuer and the Company. Delivery of the Securities shall be
made through the facilities of The Depository Trust Company unless the
Representatives shall otherwise instruct.

         3. Offering by Initial Purchasers. Each Initial Purchaser, severally
and not jointly, represents and warrants to and agrees with the Issuer and the
Company that:

                  (a) It is an "accredited investor" as that term is defined in
         Regulation D under the Act.

                  (b) It has not offered or sold, and will not offer or sell,
         any Securities except to those it reasonably believes to be qualified
         institutional buyers (as defined in Rule 144A under the Act) and that,
         in connection with each such sale, it has taken or will take reasonable
         steps to ensure that the purchaser of such Securities is aware that
         such sale is being made in reliance on Rule 144A. In the case of a
         non-bank purchaser of a Security acting as a fiduciary for one or more
         third parties, in connection with an offer and sale to such purchaser
         pursuant, such party or parties shall be a qualified institutional
         buyer(s).

                  (c) No sale of the Securities to any one purchaser will be for
         less than U.S. $100,000 principal amount. If the purchaser is a
         non-bank fiduciary acting on behalf of others, each person for whom it
         is acting must purchase at least $100,000 principal amount of the
         Securities.

                                      -10-

                  (d) Neither it nor any person acting on its behalf has made or
         will make offers or sales of the Securities in the United States by
         means of any form of general solicitation or general advertising
         (within the meaning of Regulation D) in the United States.

         4. Agreements. Each of the Issuer and the Company agrees with each
Initial Purchaser that:

                  (a) The Issuer and the Company will furnish to each Initial
         Purchaser and to counsel for the Initial Purchasers, without charge,
         during the period referred to in paragraph (c) below, as many copies of
         the Final Memorandum and any amendments and supplements thereto as they
         may reasonably request.

                  (b) The Issuer and the Guarantors will not amend or supplement
         the Final Memorandum, other than by filing documents under the Exchange
         Act that are incorporated by reference therein, without the prior
         written consent of the Representatives, which consent shall not be
         unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided, however, that, prior to the
         completion of the distribution of the Securities by the Initial
         Purchasers (as determined by the Initial Purchasers), the Company will
         not file any document under the Exchange Act that is incorporated by
         reference in the Final Memorandum unless, prior to such proposed
         filing, the Company has furnished the Representatives with a copy of
         such document for their review and consent to such filing, which
         consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. The Company will
         promptly advise the Representatives when any document filed under the
         Exchange Act that is incorporated by reference in the Final Memorandum
         shall have been filed with the Commission.

                  (c) If at any time prior to the completion of the sale of the
         Securities by the Initial Purchasers (as determined by the
         Representatives), any event occurs as a result of which the Final
         Memorandum, as then amended or supplemented, would include any untrue
         statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
         necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the
         circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or if it
         should be necessary to amend or supplement the Final Memorandum to
         comply with applicable law, the Issuer and the Guarantors promptly (i)
         will notify the Representatives of any such event; (ii) subject to the
         requirements of paragraph (b) of this Section 4, will prepare an
         amendment or supplement that will correct such statement or omission or
         effect such compliance; and (iii) will supply any supplemented or
         amended Final Memorandum to the several Initial Purchasers and counsel
         for the Initial Purchasers without charge in such quantities as they
         may reasonably request.

                                      -11-

                  (d) The Issuer and the Guarantors will use their best efforts,
         in cooperation with the Initial Purchasers, to arrange, if necessary,
         for the qualification of the Securities for sale by the Initial
         Purchasers under the laws of such jurisdictions as the Initial
         Purchasers may designate and will maintain such qualifications in
         effect so long as required for the sale of the Securities; provided
         that in no event shall the Issuer and the Guarantors be obligated to
         qualify to do business in any jurisdiction where they are not now so
         qualified or to take any action that would subject them to service of
         process in suits, other than those arising out of the offering or sale
         of the Securities, in any jurisdiction where they are not now so
         subject. The Issuer and the Company will promptly advise the
         Representatives of the receipt by the Issuer or any of the Guarantors
         of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification
         of the Securities for sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation or
         threatening of any proceeding for such purpose.

                  (e) Neither the Issuer nor the Company will resell any
         Securities that have been acquired by either of them; the Issuer and
         the Company will not permit any of their respective Affiliates to
         resell any Securities that have been acquired by any of them until the
         completion of the Exchange Offer (as defined in the Registration Rights
         Agreement).

                  (f) None of the Company, the Guarantors, or any of their
         respective Affiliates, nor any person acting on its or their behalf
         will, directly or indirectly, make offers or sales of any security, or
         solicit offers to buy any security, under circumstances that would
         require the registration of the Securities under the Act.

                  (g) None of the Company, the Guarantors, or any of their
         respective Affiliates, nor any person acting on its or their behalf
         will engage in any form of general solicitation or general advertising
         (within the meaning of Regulation D) in connection with any offer or
         sale of the Securities in the United States.

                  (h) So long as any of the Securities are "restricted
         securities" within the meaning of Rule 144(a)(3) under the Act, the
         Company will, during any period in which it is not subject to and in
         compliance with Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act or it is not
         exempt from such reporting requirements pursuant to and in compliance
         with Rule 12g3-2(b) under the Exchange Act, provide to each holder of
         such restricted securities and to each prospective purchaser (as
         designated by such holder) of such restricted securities, upon the
         request of such holder or prospective purchaser, any information
         required to be provided by Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Act. This covenant
         is intended to be for the benefit of the holders, and the prospective
         purchasers designated by such holders, from time to time of such
         restricted securities.

                                      -12-

                  (i) The Issuer and the Guarantors will cooperate with the
         Representatives and use its and their best efforts to permit the
         Securities to be eligible for clearance and settlement through The
         Depository Trust Company.

                  (j) Neither the Issuer nor any of the Guarantors will for a
         period of ten business days following the Closing Date, without the
         prior written consent of Salomon Smith Barney, offer, sell or contract
         to sell, or otherwise dispose of (or enter into any transaction which
         is designed to, or might reasonably be expected to, result in the
         disposition (whether by actual disposition or effective economic
         disposition due to cash settlement or otherwise) by the Issuer or the
         Guarantors or any of their respective Affiliates or any person in
         privity with the Issuer or the Guarantors or any of their respective
         Affiliates), directly or indirectly, or announce the offering of, any
         debt securities issued or guaranteed by the Issuer or the Guarantors
         (other than the Securities). Notwithstanding anything in this Section
         to the contrary, the Company directly or indirectly through a
         subsidiary, may (i) make borrowings under the Bank Credit Facilities
         (as defined in the Indenture) pursuant to the terms and conditions of
         such agreement, (ii) enter into purchase money mortgage transactions,
         (iii) obtain letters of credit and (iv) enter into such other
         commercial lending transactions consistent with the Company's business.

                  (k) The Issuer and the Guarantors will not take, directly or
         indirectly, any action designed to or which has constituted or which
         might reasonably be expected to cause or result, under the Exchange Act
         or otherwise, in stabilization or manipulation of the price of any
         security of the Issuer and the Guarantors to facilitate the sale or
         resale of the Securities.

                  (l) The Issuer and the Company agree to pay all expenses
         incident to the performance of their obligations under this Agreement,
         including (i) the costs of the preparation and printing of the
         Preliminary Memorandum and Final Memorandum and each amendment or
         supplement thereto, (ii) the costs of printing and distributing to the
         Initial Purchasers and any selected dealers the Final Memorandum, and
         all amendments or supplements thereto, as provided in this Agreement,

         5. Conditions to the Obligations of the Initial Purchasers. The
obligations of the Initial Purchasers to purchase the Securities shall be
subject to the accuracy of the representations and warranties on the part of the
Issuer and the Guarantors contained herein at the Execution Time, the Closing
Date and any settlement date pursuant to Section 3 hereof, to the accuracy of
the statements of the Issuer and the Guarantors made in any certificates
pursuant to the provisions hereof, to the performance by the Issuer and the
Guarantors of their respective obligations hereunder and to the following
additional conditions:

                  (a) The Issuer and the Company shall have requested and caused
         Wolf, Block, Schorr and Solis-Cohen LLP, counsel for the Issuer and the
         Guarantors, and the General Counsel of the Company,(1) to furnish to
         the Representatives their opinions, dated the Closing Date and
         addressed to the Representatives, to the effect that:

                           (i) each of the Issuer, the Company and the
                  subsidiaries named in Schedule II hereto (the "Subsidiaries"
                  or, in the singular, the "Subsidiary") has been duly
                  incorporated (if a corporation) or formed (if a partnership or
                  limited liability corporation) and is validly existing as a
                  corporation, partnership or limited liability company, as the
                  case may be, in good standing (if applicable) (based solely
                  upon review of certificates issued by a governmental agency,
                  authority or body or, in the absence of such certificates, to
                  the knowledge of such counsel) under the laws of its
                  jurisdiction of incorporation or formation, as the case may be
                  (except where the failure to so be in good standing would not
                  have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse
                  effect on the condition (financial or otherwise) or earnings
                  of the Company and its subsidiaries considered as one
                  enterprise, whether or not arising in the ordinary course of
                  business (a "Material Adverse Effect"), with full corporate or
                  other organizational power and authority to own or lease, as
                  the case may be, and to operate its properties and conduct its
                  business as described in the Final Memorandum, and is duly
                  qualified (based solely upon review of certificates issued by
                  a governmental agency, authority or body or, in the absence of
                  such certificates, to the knowledge of such counsel) to do
                  business as a foreign corporation, partnership, limited
                  liability company or trust, as the case may be, and is in good
                  standing (if applicable) under the laws of each jurisdiction
                  which requires such qualification (except where the failure to
                  so qualify would not have, individually or in the aggregate,
                  in a Material Adverse Effect);

                           (ii) all the outstanding shares of capital stock or
                  outstanding interests of the Issuer and the Company and, to
                  the best knowledge of such counsel, each Subsidiary of the
                  Company have been duly and validly authorized and issued and
                  are fully paid and nonassessable, and, except as otherwise set
                  forth in the Final Memorandum, all outstanding shares of
                  capital stock or outstanding interests of the Subsidiaries are
                  owned by the Company either directly or through wholly owned
                  subsidiaries free and clear of any perfected security interest
                  and, to the best knowledge of such counsel any other security
                  interests, claims, liens or encumbrances;

                           (iii) the Company's authorized equity capitalization
                  is as set forth in the Final Memorandum;

                           (iv) the Indenture has been duly authorized, executed
                  and delivered, and (assuming due authorization, execution and
                  delivery by the Trustee) constitutes a legal, valid and
                  binding instrument enforceable against the Issuer and the
                  Guarantors in accordance with its terms (subject, as to the
                  enforcement of remedies, to applicable bankruptcy,
                  reorganization, insolvency, moratorium or other laws affecting
                  creditors' rights generally from time to time in effect and to
                  general principles of equity); the Securities have been duly
                  and validly authorized and, when executed and authenticated in
                  accordance with the provisions of the Indenture (assuming due
                  authorization, execution and delivery by the Trustee) and
                  delivered to and paid for by the Initial Purchasers under this
                  Agreement, will constitute legal, valid, binding and
                  enforceable obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors
                  entitled to the benefits of the Indenture (subject, as to the
                  enforcement of remedies, to applicable bankruptcy,
                  reorganization, insolvency, moratorium or other laws affecting
                  creditors' rights generally from time to time in effect and to
                  general principles of equity); the Registration Rights
                  Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered and
                  (assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by the
                  Initial Purchasers) constitutes the legal, valid, binding and
                  enforceable instrument of the Issuer and the Guarantors
                  (subject, as to the enforcement of remedies, to applicable
                  bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium or other
                  laws affecting creditors' rights generally from time to time
                  in effect and to general principles of equity); and the
                  Securities, the Indenture and the Registration Rights
                  Agreement conform in all material respects to the descriptions
                  thereof in the Final Memorandum;

                           (v) based solely upon review of certificates executed
                  by an officer or officers of the Issuer and the Company, to
                  the extent of the actual knowledge of such counsel, there is

                  Subsidiaries that is not adequately disclosed in the Final
                  Memorandum, except in each case for such proceedings that, if
                  the subject of an unfavorable decision, ruling or finding
                  would not have, individually or in the aggregate, in a
                  Material Adverse Effect; and the information in the Final
                  Memorandum under the heading "Certain United States Federal
                  Income Tax Considerations," insofar as such information
                  constitutes matters of law, summaries of legal matters or
                  legal conclusions, has been reviewed by such counsel and is
                  correct in all material respects;

                  requisite corporate power and authority, has taken all
                  requisite corporate action, and has received and is in

                  court or governmental agency or body is required in connection
                  with the transactions contemplated herein or in the Indenture
                  and the Registration Rights Agreement, except such as will be
                  obtained under the Act and the Trust Indenture Act and such as
                  may be required under the blue sky or securities laws of any
                  jurisdiction in connection with the purchase and sale of the

                  Indenture, this Agreement or the Registration Rights
                  Agreement, the issue and sale of the Securities, or the
                  consummation of any other of the transactions herein or
                  therein contemplated, nor the fulfillment of the terms hereof
                  or thereof will conflict with, result in a breach or violation
                  of, or constitute a default under, (i) the charter, by-laws or
                  other organization documents of the Company or its
                  Subsidiaries; (ii) the terms of any indenture, contract,
                  lease, mortgage, deed of trust, note agreement, loan agreement
                  or other agreement, obligation, condition, covenant or
                  instrument to which the Issuer, the Company or any of the
                  Subsidiaries is a party or bound and is known to such counsel;
                  or (iii) any statute, law, rule, regulation, judgment, order
                  or decree applicable to the Issuer, the Company or any of the
                  Subsidiaries of any court, regulatory body, administrative

                  agency, governmental body, arbitrator or other authority
                  having jurisdiction over the Issuer, the Company or any of the
                  Subsidiaries (except in the cases of clauses (ii) and (iii)
                  for such conflicts, breaches, defaults or violations that
                  would not have, individually or in the aggregate, in a
                  Material Adverse Effect);

                           (ix) assuming the accuracy of the representations and
                  warranties and compliance with the agreements contained
                  herein, no registration of the Securities under the Act, and
                  no qualification of an indenture under the Trust Indenture
                  Act, are required for the offer and sale by the Initial
                  Purchasers of the Securities in the manner contemplated by
                  this Agreement; and

                           (x) none of the Issuer or the Guarantors is and,
                  after giving effect to the offering and sale of the Securities
                  and the application of the proceeds thereof as described in
                  the Final Memorandum, none will be an "investment company" as
                  defined in the Investment Company Act without taking account
                  of any exemption arising out of the number of holders of the
                  Issuer's or the Guarantors' securities.

                  In rendering such opinion, such counsel may rely (A) as to
         matters involving the application of laws of any jurisdiction other
         than the jurisdiction of incorporation of the Issuer or the Guarantors,
         the State of New York or the Federal laws of the United States, to the
         extent they deem proper and specified in such opinion, upon the opinion
         of other counsel of good standing whom they believe to be reliable and
         who are satisfactory to counsel for the Initial Purchasers; and (B) as
         to matters of fact, to the extent they deem proper, on certificates of
         responsible officers of the Issuer or the Guarantors and public
         officials. References to the Final Memorandum in this Section 5(a)
         include any amendment or supplement thereto at the Closing Date. Such
         opinion shall state that no facts have come to the attention of such
         counsel which leads such counsel to believe that either the Preliminary
         Memorandum or the Final Memorandum, as of their respective dates and
         the Final Memorandum as of the Closing Date, contained an untrue
         statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact
         required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
         therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made,
         not misleading; provided, further, that such counsel need not express
         any comment with respect to the financial statements, including the
         notes thereto and supporting schedules, the Management's Discussion and
         Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations or any other
         financial or statistical data set forth, incorporated in or referred to
         in either the Preliminary Memorandum or the Final Memorandum.

                  (b) The Representatives shall have received from Cahill Gordon
         & Reindel, counsel for the Initial Purchasers, such opinion or
         opinions, dated the Closing Date and addressed to the Representatives,

                                      -17-


         with respect to the issuance and sale of the Securities, the Indenture,
         the Registration Rights Agreement, the Final Memorandum (as amended or
         supplemented at the Closing Date) (it being understood that such
         counsel need not express any comment with respect to the financial
         statements, including the notes thereto, or any other financial data
         that is found in or derived from the internal accounting or other
         records of the Company and its subsidiaries set forth or referred to in
         the Final Memorandum) and other related matters as the Representatives
         may reasonably require, and the Issuer and the Guarantors shall have
         furnished to such counsel such documents as they request for the
         purpose of enabling them to pass upon such matters.

                  (c) The Issuer and the Company shall have furnished to the
         Representatives a certificate of the Issuer and the Company, signed by
         the President or an Executive or Senior Vice President and the
         principal financial or accounting officer of each of the Issuer and the
         Company, dated the Closing Date, to the effect that the signers of such
         certificate have carefully examined the Final Memorandum, any amendment
         or supplement to the Final Memorandum and this Agreement and that:

                           (i) the representations and warranties of the Issuer
                  and the Guarantors in this Agreement are true and correct in
                  all material respects on and as of the Closing Date with the
                  same effect as if made on the Closing Date, and each of the
                  Issuer and the Guarantors has complied with all the agreements
                  and satisfied all the conditions on its part to be performed
                  or satisfied hereunder at or prior to the Closing Date; and

                           (ii) since the date of the most recent financial
                  statements included in the Final Memorandum (exclusive of any
                  amendment or supplement thereto), there has been no Material
                  Adverse Change, whether or not arising from transactions in
                  the ordinary course of business, except as set forth in or
                  contemplated by the Final Memorandum (exclusive of any
                  amendment or supplement thereto).

                  (d) At the Closing Date, the Company shall have requested and
         caused Ernst & Young LLP to furnish to the Representatives a letter,
         dated as of the Closing Date, in form and substance satisfactory to the
         Representatives, confirming that they are independent accountants
         within the meaning of the Act and the Exchange Act and the applicable
         rules and regulations thereunder, that they have performed a review of
         the unaudited interim financial information of the Company for the
         nine-month period ended July 31, 2002 and as at July 31, 2002

<PAGE>
                                      -18-

                           (i) in their opinion the audited financial statements
                  and financial statement schedules incorporated in the Final
                  Memorandum and reported on by them comply as to form in all
                  material respects with the applicable accounting requirements
                  of the Exchange Act and the related published rules and
                  regulations thereunder;

                           (ii) on the basis of a reading of the latest
                  unaudited financial statements made available by the Company
                  and its subsidiaries; their limited review in accordance with
                  the standards established under Statement on Auditing
                  Standards No. 71, of the unaudited interim financial
                  information for the nine-month period ended July 31, 2002 and
                  as at July 31, 2002 as indicated in their report incorporated
                  in the Final Memorandum; carrying out certain specified
                  procedures (but not an examination in accordance with
                  generally accepted auditing standards) which would not
                  necessarily reveal matters of significance with respect to the
                  comments set forth in such letter; a reading of the minutes of
                  the meetings of the stockholders, the board directors and all
                  committees of the board of directors of the Company and its
                  subsidiaries; and inquiries of certain officials of the
                  Company who have responsibility for financial and accounting
                  matters of the Company and its subsidiaries as to transactions
                  and events subsequent to October 31, 2001 nothing came to
                  their attention which caused them to believe that:

                                    (1) any unaudited consolidated financial
                           statements incorporated in the Final Memorandum do
                           not comply in form in all material respects with
                           applicable accounting requirements and with the
                           published rules and regulations of the Commission
                           with respect to financial statements included or
                           incorporated in quarterly reports on Form 10-Q under
                           the Exchange Act; and said unaudited financial
                           statements are not in conformity with generally
                           accepted accounting principles applied on a basis
                           substantially consistent with that of the audited
                           financial statements included or incorporated in the
                           Final Memorandum; or

                                    (2) with respect to the period subsequent to
                           July 31, 2002, at a specified date not more than five
                           days prior to the date of the letter, there were any
                           decreases in the capital stock or there were any
                           increases in the long-term debt of the Company and
                           its subsidiaries or any decreases in the total
                           consolidated assets of the Company and its
                           subsidiaries as compared with the amounts shown on
                           the July 31, 2002 consolidated balance sheet
                           incorporated in the Final Memorandum, or for the
                           period from August 1, 2002 to such specified date
                           there were any decreases, as compared with April 30,
                           2002, in income before income taxes, in consolidated


<PAGE>
                                      -19-


                           net revenues or income before income taxes or in
                           total or per share amounts of net income of the
                           Company and its subsidiaries, except in all instances
                           for changes or decreases set forth in such letter, in
                           which case the letter shall be accompanied by an
                           explanation by the Company as to the significance
                           thereof unless said explanation is not deemed
                           necessary by the Representatives; or

                           (iii) they have performed certain other specified
                  procedures as a result of which they determined that certain
                  information of an accounting, financial or statistical nature
                  (which is limited to accounting, financial or statistical
                  information derived from the general accounting records of the
                  Company and its subsidiaries) set forth in the Final
                  Memorandum, including the information set forth under the
                  captions "Selected Consolidated Financial Information and
                  Operating Data" in the Final Memorandum, the information
                  included or incorporated in Items 1, 2, 6, 7 and 11 of the
                  Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
                  October 31, 2001, as amended, incorporated in the Final
                  Memorandum and the information included in the "Management's
                  Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
                  Operations" included or incorporated in the Company's
                  Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, incorporated for the fiscal
                  quarters ended July 31, 2002, April 30, 2002 and July 31, 2002
                  in the Final Memorandum and the information included in the
                  Company's Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the
                  Commission on July 2, 2002 and November 15, 2002 agrees with
                  the accounting records of the Company and its subsidiaries,
                  excluding any questions of legal interpretation.

                  References to the Final Memorandum in this Section 5(d)
         include any amendment or supplement thereto at the date of the
         applicable letter.

                  (e) Subsequent to the Execution Time or, if earlier, the dates
         as of which information is given in the Final Memorandum (exclusive of
         any amendment or supplement thereto), there shall not have been (i) any
         change or decrease specified in the letter referred to in paragraph (d)
         of this Section 5; or (ii) any Material Adverse Change, whether or not
         arising from transactions in the ordinary course of business, except as
         set forth in or contemplated in the Final Memorandum (exclusive of any
         amendment or supplement thereto) the effect of which, in any case
         referred to in clause (i) or (ii) above, is, in the sole judgment of
         the Representatives, so material and adverse as to make it impractical
         or inadvisable to market the Securities as contemplated by the Final
         Memorandum (exclusive of any amendment or supplement thereto).

<PAGE>
                                      -20-


                  (f) Subsequent to the Execution Time, there shall not have
         been any decrease in the rating of any of the debt securities of Toll
         Corp. by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization"
         (as defined for purposes of Rule 436(g) under the Act) or any notice
         given of any intended or potential decrease in any such rating or of a
         possible change in any such rating that does not indicate the direction
         of the possible change.

                  (g) Prior to the Closing Date, the Issuer and the Guarantors
         shall have furnished to the Representatives such further information,
         certificates and documents as the Representatives may reasonably
         request.

         If any of the conditions specified in this Section 5 shall not have
been fulfilled in all material respects when and as provided in this Agreement,
or if any of the opinions and certificates mentioned above or elsewhere in this
Agreement shall not be in all material respects reasonably satisfactory in form
and substance to the Representatives and counsel for the Initial Purchasers,
this Agreement and all obligations of the Initial Purchasers hereunder may be
canceled at, or at any time prior to, the Closing Date by the Representatives.
Notice of such cancellation shall be given to the Issuer and the Company in
writing or by telephone or facsimile confirmed in writing.

         The documents required to be delivered by this Section 5 will be
delivered at the office of counsel for the Initial Purchasers, at 80 Pine
Street, New York, New York 10005, on the Closing Date.

         6. Reimbursement of Expenses. If the sale of the Securities provided
for herein is not consummated because any condition to the obligations of the
Initial Purchasers set forth in this Section 5 hereof is not satisfied, because
of any termination pursuant to Section 9 hereof or because of any refusal,
inability or failure on the part of the Company to perform any agreement herein
or comply with any provision hereof other than by reason of a default by any of
the Initial Purchasers, the Issuer and the Company will reimburse the Initial
Purchasers severally through Salomon Smith Barney on demand for all
out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel)
that shall have been incurred by them in connection with the proposed purchase
and sale of the Securities.

         7. Indemnification and Contribution. (a) Each of the Issuer and the
Guarantors agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Initial Purchaser, the
directors, officers, employees and agents of each Initial Purchaser and each
person who controls any Initial Purchaser within the meaning of either the Act
or the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities,
joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Act,
the Exchange Act or other Federal or state statutory law or regulation, at
common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities

<PAGE>
                                      -21-


(or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue
statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the
Preliminary Memorandum, the Final Memorandum (or in any supplement or amendment
thereto) or any information provided by the Issuer or any of the Guarantors to
any holder or prospective purchaser of Securities pursuant to Section 5(h), or
in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based
upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and agrees to
reimburse each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any legal or other
expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or
defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; provided, however,
that the Issuer and the Guarantors will not be liable in any such case to the
extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based
upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or
alleged omission made in the Preliminary Memorandum or the Final Memorandum, or
in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, in reliance upon and in
conformity with written information furnished to the Issuer or any of the
Guarantors by or on behalf of any Initial Purchasers through the Representatives
specifically for inclusion therein. This indemnity agreement will be in addition
to any liability which the Issuer and the Guarantors may otherwise have.

         (b) Each Initial Purchaser severally and not jointly agrees to
indemnify and hold harmless the each of the Issuer and the Guarantors, each of
its directors, each of its officers, and each person who controls the Issuer and
the Guarantors within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, to the
same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Issuer and the Guarantors to
each Initial Purchaser, but only with reference to written information relating
to such Initial Purchaser furnished to the Issuer and the Guarantors by or on
behalf of such Initial Purchaser through the Representatives specifically for
inclusion in the Preliminary Memorandum or the Final Memorandum (or in any
amendment or supplement thereto). This indemnity agreement will be in addition
to any liability which any Initial Purchaser may otherwise have. The Issuer and
the Guarantors acknowledge that the statements set forth in the last paragraph
of the cover page regarding the delivery of the Securities and paragraph 6 under
the heading "Plan of Distribution" in the Preliminary Memorandum and the Final
Memorandum, constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf
of the Initial Purchasers for inclusion in the Preliminary Memorandum or the
Final Memorandum (or in any amendment or supplement thereto).

         (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 7
of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a
claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this
Section 7, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof;
but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from
liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent it did not
otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the


<PAGE>
                                      -22-


indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses; and (ii) will not, in any
event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified
party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b)
above. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel of the
indemnifying party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the
indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which
case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and
expenses of any separate counsel retained by the indemnified party or parties);
provided, however, that such counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to the
indemnified party. An indemnifying party may participate in its own expense in
the defense of any action; provided, however, that counsel to the indemnifying
party shall not (except with the consent of the indemnified party) also be
counsel to the indemnified party. In no event shall the indemnifying parties be
liable for the fees and expenses or more than one counsel (in addition to any
local counsel) separate from their own counsel for all indemnified parties in
connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the
same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances.
An indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the
indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any
judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or
proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought
hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential
parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent
includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability
arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding.

         (d) In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a) or (b) of
this Section 7 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified
party for any reason, the Issuer and the Guarantors and the Initial Purchasers
agree to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities
(including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with
investigating or defending same) (collectively "Losses") to which the Issuer or
the Guarantors and one or more of the Initial Purchasers may be subject in such
proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the
Company on the one hand and by the Initial Purchasers on the other from the
offering of the Securities; provided, however, that in no case shall any Initial
Purchaser (except as may be provided in any agreement among the Initial
Purchasers relating to the offering of the Securities) be responsible for any
amount in excess of the purchase discount or commission applicable to the
Securities purchased by such Initial Purchaser hereunder. If the allocation
provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason,
the Issuer and the Guarantors and the Initial Purchasers shall contribute in
such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but
also the relative fault of the Issuer and the Guarantors on the one hand and of
the Initial Purchasers on the other in connection with the statements or
omissions which resulted in such Losses, as well as any other relevant equitable
considerations. Benefits received by the Issuer and the Guarantors shall be
deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting


<PAGE>
                                      -23-


expenses) received by it, and benefits received by the Initial Purchasers shall
be deemed to be equal to the total purchase discounts and commissions in each
case set forth on the cover of the Final Memorandum. Relative fault shall be
determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or any
alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission
to state a material fact relates to information provided by the Issuer and the
Guarantors on the one hand or the Initial Purchasers on the other, the intent of
the parties and their relative knowledge, information and opportunity to correct
or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Issuer and the Guarantors and
the Initial Purchasers agree that it would not be just and equitable if
contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of
allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred
to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no person guilty
of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act)
shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such
fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 7, each person who
controls an Initial Purchaser within the meaning of either the Act or the
Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee and agent of an Initial
Purchaser shall have the same rights to contribution as such Initial Purchaser,
and each person who controls any of the Issuer and the Guarantors within the
meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and each officer and director of
the Issuer and the Guarantors shall have the same rights to contribution as the
Issuer and the Guarantors, subject in each case to the applicable terms and
conditions of this paragraph (d).

         8. Default by an Initial Purchaser. If any one or more Initial
Purchasers shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Securities agreed to be
purchased by such Initial Purchaser hereunder and such failure to purchase shall
constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this
Agreement, the remaining Initial Purchasers shall be obligated severally to take
up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the amount of Securities set
forth opposite their names in Schedule I hereto bears to the aggregate amount of
Securities set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Initial Purchasers)
the Securities which the defaulting Initial Purchaser or Initial Purchasers
agreed but failed to purchase; provided, however, that in the event that the
aggregate amount of Securities which the defaulting Initial Purchaser or Initial
Purchasers agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate
amount of Securities set forth in Schedule I hereto, the remaining Initial
Purchasers shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any
obligation to purchase any, of the Securities, and if such nondefaulting Initial
Purchasers do not purchase all the Securities, this Agreement will terminate
without liability to any nondefaulting Initial Purchaser or the Issuer and the
Guarantors. In the event of a default by any Initial Purchaser as set forth in
this Section 8, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not
exceeding five Business Days, as the Representatives shall determine in order
that the required changes in the Final Memorandum or in any other documents or
arrangements may be effected. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve
any defaulting Initial Purchaser of its liability, if any, to the Issuer and the
Guarantors or any nondefaulting Initial Purchaser for damages occasioned by its
default hereunder.

                                      -24-

         9. Termination. This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the
absolute discretion of the Representatives, by notice given to the Issuer and
the Company prior to delivery of and payment for the Securities, if at any time
prior to such time (i) trading in the Company's Common Stock shall have been
suspended by the Commission or the New York Stock Exchange or trading in
securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock
Exchange, or the NASDAQ National Market shall have been suspended or limited or
minimum prices shall have been established on such exchanges or the NASDAQ
National Market; (ii) a banking moratorium shall have been declared either by
Federal or New York State authorities; (iii) there shall have occurred any
outbreak or escalation of hostilities, declaration by the United States of a
national emergency or war, or other calamity or crisis the effect of which on
financial markets is such as to make it, in the sole judgment of the
Representatives, impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or
delivery of the Securities as contemplated by the Final Memorandum (exclusive of
any amendment or supplement thereto); or (iv) since the respective dates as of
which information is given in the Preliminary Memorandum and the Final
Memorandum, there has been a Material Adverse Change.

         10. Representations and Indemnities to Survive. The respective
agreements, representations, warranties, indemnities and other statements of the
Issuer and the Guarantors or their respective officers and of the Initial
Purchasers set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full
force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the
Initial Purchasers or the Issuer and the Guarantors or any of the officers,
directors or controlling persons referred to in Section 7 hereof, and will
survive delivery of and payment for the Securities. The provisions of Sections 6
and 7 hereof shall survive the termination or cancellation of this Agreement.

         11. Notices. All communications hereunder will be in writing and
effective only on receipt, and, if sent to the Representatives, will be mailed,
delivered or telefaxed to the Salomon Smith Barney General Counsel (fax no.:

         12. Successors. This Agreement will inure to the benefit of and be
binding upon the parties hereto and their respective successors and the officers
and directors and controlling persons referred to in Section 7 hereof, and,
except as expressly set forth in Section 4(h) hereof, no other person will have
any right or obligation hereunder.
