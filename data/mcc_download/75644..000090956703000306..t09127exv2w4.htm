</FONT>

<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Zemex declares, sets aside or pays any dividend on, or makes any other
actual, constructive or deemed distribution in respect of any of the Shares, or
otherwise makes any payments to the holders of the Shares in their capacity as
such, during the period commencing on the date of the Arrangement Agreement and
ending upon the Effective Date, Subco may reduce the amount of the Cash
Proceeds per Share by any amount it determines in its sole discretion, provided
that such discount shall not exceed the amount of such dividend distribution or
payment received per Share.
