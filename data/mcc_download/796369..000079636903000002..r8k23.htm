<hr>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing, the mutual covenants

recited in this Agreement, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged,
the parties agree as follows:</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1. <u>Engagement and Authorization</u>.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.01 <u>Engagement As Manager</u>. Owner hereby engages Manager as its
sole and exclusive agent to supervise, manage, direct and control the operations of the
Restaurants, in accordance with the terms and conditions hereof. Manager hereby accepts
such engagement as the manager of the Restaurants during the Term, as hereafter defined,
of this Agreement.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.02 <u>Grant of Authority</u>. Owner hereby grants Manager full power
and authority to take all actions and to do all things reasonably required to perform the
obligations of the Manager under this Agreement; provided that: (i) Manager shall not have

other lien on any tangible or intangible asset of Owner without the approval of Owner. In
the performance of this Agreement, Manager shall act as the agent of Owner; and (ii) such
power and authority will be limited to providing the Services, as defined herein. Nothing
herein shall constitute or be construed to be or create a partnership, joint venture or
lease between Owner and Manager. The creation of this agency shall not in any manner
relieve Owner of its duties or obligations under contract or law. All debts and
liabilities incurred by Manager in the course of its management of the Restaurants shall
be the debts and liabilities of Owner and in no event shall be the debts and liabilities
of Manager. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2. <u>Manager&#146;s Duties</u>. Throughout the Term of this Agreement,
Manager will use the Manager's commercially reasonable efforts and due diligence to manage
and operate the Restaurants in a manner and quality not less than those provided by
Manager with respect to the restaurants it owns. During the Term, Manager shall provide
Owner with the following specific services (hereinafter collectively referred to as the
&quot;Services&quot;), at each of the Restaurants:</p>

and (f) the preparation of the Restaurants' monthly activities, as more particularly

in such a manner that each Restaurant is at all times in substantial compliance with: (i)
all zoning and use restrictions, fire codes, building codes, and other requirements issued
by any governmental authority; (ii) all licenses, permits and other authorizations
required in the operation of the Restaurants; (iii) any policy of insurance covering the

application of any legal requirement, tax or other imposition against the Restaurants.
Owner shall execute and deliver any documents which Manager deems reasonably necessary and
appropriate in connection with such action.</p>

<hr>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.02 <u>Operating Budget</u>. Within thirty (30) days of the execution
of this Agreement, Manager will recommend and submit to Owner a forecast (the
&quot;Proposed Operating Budget&quot;) reflecting: (a) an itemization of the estimated
receipts, disbursements, operational expenditures and capital expenditures for the ensuing
calendar year; (b) a summary of rates to be charged for food and beverage menu prices,
catering, conference, banquet and other common area use charges; (c) a staffing plan
indicating the number of employees, job titles, salaries and fringe benefits applicable to
each employee and a description of the workers' compensation coverage maintained by the
Manager with respect to each employee; (d) a listing of the service contracts executed or
proposed to be executed by the Manager in the course of operating the Restaurants
identifying the contract vendor, the services to be provided, the contract amount and the
term of the service contract; (e) a description of the marketing program to be undertaken
by the Manager identifying the costs thereof, the complimentary services to be provided
and the improvement in sales which the Manager anticipates; (f) a description of the
complimentary food and beverage services which the Manager will accord to the employees
and the travel expenses anticipated to be reimbursed to the employees; (g) a listing of
any affiliates (meaning any person or entity over which the Manager has the ability to
control policy determinations, whether by ownership, by contract or otherwise) of the
Manager which will provide services to the Restaurants; (h) a report of any anticipated
changes in any requirements of law affecting the Restaurants and the status of any license
or permit necessary to the operation of the Restaurants; and (i) such additional
information as might be recommended by Manager or reasonably requested by Owner with
respect to the anticipated operation of the Restaurants. The Proposed Operating Budget
will be submitted to the Owner for approval and the Owner will have the right to make any
changes thereto and finalize the Proposed Operating Budget in form satisfactory to the
Owner in the Owner's sole discretion. The Owner will inform the Manager of approval of or
any change to the Proposed Operating Budget prior to commencement of the period covered by
the Proposed Operating Budget and, when approved by the Owner, the same will constitute
the approved operating budget (the &quot;Approved Operating Budget&quot;) pursuant to
which the Manager will manage and operate the Restaurants during the ensuing calendar
year. The Manager will thereafter prepare and deliver to the Owner prior to the beginning
of each quarter during the ensuing year any changes in the information contained in the
Approved Operating Budget necessary to reflect current conditions. At the sole option of
the Owner, the Approved Operating Budget may be revised at any time by delivery of written
notice to the Manager and the Approved Operating Budget, as amended, will thereafter
constitute the standard pursuant to which the Manager will manage and operate the
Restaurants. The Manager will authorize no expense in the operation, marketing or
management of the Restaurants in excess of the amount allocated to the various
classifications of expense in the Approved Operating Budget without the prior consent of
the Owner; provided, however, the Manager may expend sums without the prior approval of
the Owner under emergency circumstances requiring expenditures which are immediately
necessary for the preservation or safety of the Restaurants or to avoid danger to life or
property. The Owner acknowledges that the financial forecasts contained in the Approved
Operating Budget will represent the Manager's good faith estimate of the anticipated
operating results and are not intended to constitute a guarantee that such financial
results will in fact be achieved.</p>

<hr>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.03 <u>Operating Expenses</u>. Subject to the limitations established
by the Approved Operating Budget, the Manager will: (a) pay all expenses of operating the
Restaurants from funds on deposit in the Operating Account; (b) negotiate and enter into
on Owner's behalf all service contracts, including without limitation, water, electricity,
gas, fuel, telephone, contracts for janitorial services, vermin extermination, trash
removal, landscaping services, and other services required to operate and maintain the
Restaurants; (c) purchase supplies, equipment and materials which are required to operate
and maintain the Restaurants; (d) maintain the premises of the Restaurants in a manner
which maximizes the appearance and operation of the Restaurants to the Restaurants'
potential, including without limitation, interior and exterior cleaning, plumbing, and
such other normal maintenance and repair work as might be desirable; and (e) negotiate and
enter into contracts for the marketing, promotion and advertisement of the Restaurants.
Unless otherwise approved by Owner, all service contracts will be executed in the name of
the Manager or in the name of the Manager as agent for the Owner, will be assignable to
the Owner or the Owner's designee, will be terminable on thirty (30) days' prior notice by
the Manager, will require that the contractor provide evidence of appropriate insurance
coverage and will be for amounts not in excess of the amounts reflected in the Approved
Operating Budget. Whether entered into in the name of Manager or in the name of Manager as
agent for the Owner, the agreement shall be deemed entered into on behalf of Owner as
principal, and Owner rather than Manager shall be liable for the performance of all
obligations under, and shall receive all benefits, under such agreements. As reasonably
requested by Manager, Owner shall execute and enter into any agreements relating to the
Restaurants.<font FACE="Century Gothic"> </p>
</font>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.04 <u>Operating Account</u>. Manager shall open and maintain on
behalf of Owner a separate bank account (the &quot;Operating Account&quot;) at a
commercial bank approved by Owner. Title to the Operating Account shall indicate that the
funds therein are being held in trust for the benefit of Owner. Owner and Manager shall
each have the power to withdraw funds from the Operating Account. Manager will deposit
into the Operating Account and hold in a fiduciary capacity all monies furnished by Owner
and all funds received from the operation of the Restaurants. Manager will pay from the
Operating Account all amounts authorized by the Approved Operating Budget. Owner will
provide to Manager an initial deposit in an amount sufficient to pay the first month's
operating expenses of the Restaurants. To the extent the receipts of the Restaurants are
insufficient to pay the operating expenses of the Restaurants as the same become due, the
Owner will provide such funds as are reasonably requested by the Manager by deposit to the
Operating Account within two (2) business days after each request therefor. On the ninth
(9th) day of every month, the Manager will remit by wire transfer to the Owner that
amount, if any, which is in excess of the funds which are reasonably estimated by the
Manager to operate the Restaurants for the current month. Manager shall not in any event
be required to pay any expenses of the Restaurants with its own funds, and if it shall do
so, Owner shall reimburse Management for such expenditures upon request and receipt of
supporting documentation.</p>

records and books of account and such other records as might be appropriate to reflect the
results of operation of the Restaurants, and which shall reflect all revenues and
