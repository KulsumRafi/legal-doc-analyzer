         RE:  FIRST AMENDMENT TO GUARANTY, DATED AS OF MARCH 5, 2003 (THE
              "GUARANTY AMENDMENT"), BY AND BETWEEN VANTAGEPOINT VENTURE
              PARTNERS III (Q), L.P. AND FLEET NATIONAL BANK

Dear Bob:

         In consideration for VantagePoint Venture Partners III (Q), L.P.
("VPVP") entering into the Guaranty Amendment referenced above which increases
VPVP's guaranty obligations thereunder from $5,000,000 to $8,000,000, DSL.net,
Inc. ("DSL.net") hereby agrees to recommend to its Board of Directors, for
approval, that compensation be paid by DSL.net to VPVP for $1,000,000 of VPVP's
increased guarantee obligations. Such compensation will be in the form of
warrants to purchase the number of shares of the type of equity securities
issued by DSL.net in its next equity financing which is equal to $1,000,000
divided by the per share price of such DSL.net equity securities as set in the
next equity financing closed by DSL.net. Such compensation is subject to Board
approval (including the approval of a majority of the Directors who are
unaffiliated with VPVP). In no event will compensation be due or payable if
DSL.net does not close an equity financing on or before December 5, 2003, or if
any form of shareholder, legal or regulatory approval (including pursuant to the
rules of any stock market on which DSL.net's securities are traded) is required
in order for DSL.net to issue such compensation. By your signature below you
hereby acknowledge and agree to the foregoing. Please execute the acknowledgment
below and fax a copy of this letter to my attention at 650-869-6078 and return
the original to my attention at 1001 Bayhill Drive, Suite 300, San Bruno, CA
94066.

                                Very truly yours,

                                VantagePoint Venture
                                Partners III (Q) L.P.
