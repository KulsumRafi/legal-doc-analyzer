                       PULITZER INC. ANNUAL INCENTIVE PLAN

         Effective as of January 1, 2002, the Pulitzer Inc. Annual Incentive
Plan is amended in the following respects in order to change the principal
performance criterion from "operating cash flow" to "operating profit":

         1. The definition of "Operating Cash Flow" is deleted from Section 2 of
the Plan and the following new definition is inserted in its place: "Operating
Profit" means the operating revenue less the operating expenses of the Company
on a consolidated basis or of a Subsidiary, as shown on the Company's financial
statements."

         2. The references to "Operating Cash Flow" in Section 6.2 of the Plan
are changed to "Operating Profit".

                                            PULITZER INC.
