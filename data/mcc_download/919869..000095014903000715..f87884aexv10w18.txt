                  practitioner to disclose to and discuss with the Company's
                  medical adviser the results of such examination and any
                  matters which arise from it in order that the Company's
                  medical adviser can notify the Company of any matters which,
                  in his opinion, might hinder or prevent the Executive (if
                  during period of incapacity) from returning to work for any
                  period or (in other circumstances) from properly performing

                  of which a Group Company may be bound by an obligation of
                  confidence to any third party provided the Executive is or has
                  been made aware of such obligation

                  severable and enforceable accordingly and considered
                  reasonable by the parties (the Executive acknowledging the
                  legitimate need for the Company and the Group Companies to

                  circumstances where it would be valid if some part thereof
                  were deleted or distance of application reduced, then the
                  parties agree that such restriction shall apply with such
