to the security  interest of the Bank  hereunder,  and will, at its own expense,
dispose of such Goods in such  manner as the Bank may from time to time  direct.
After the  occurrence  and during the  continuance  of any Default or  Unmatured
Default,  the Bank may notify any Account Debtor to make payment directly to the
Bank of any  amounts  due or to become due and  enforce  the  collection  of any
Accounts by suit or otherwise and surrender, release or exchange all or any part
thereof,  or compromise  or extend or renew for a period  (whether or not longer
than the original period) any indebtedness thereunder or evidenced thereby. Such
notice may  require the  Account  Debtor or other  obligor to pay the Account or
other  obligation  directly to the Bank.  Any Proceeds shall be deposited in the
form received except for the  endorsement of the Borrower where required,  which
endorsement  the Bank is  authorized to make on the  Borrower&#146;s  behalf and
shall be held by the Bank as security for all  Liabilities,  and the Bank may at
any time and from time to time apply all or any  portion of the funds on deposit

The insurance  certificates  evidencing the Borrower&#146;s  compliance with the

insurance  and the cost of such  insurance  shall become a Liability  secured by
these presents and all sums expended shall bear interest at the highest  Default
rate of interest set forth in the Credit  Agreement  until paid. If requested by

Bank. The Borrower shall pay all insurance  premiums promptly when due and shall
provide substitute policies of insurance should the Bank at any time reject, for
reasonable cause, any such policies of insurance furnished by the Borrower.  The
Borrower  hereby  assigns  to the  Bank  the  proceeds  of all  such  insurance,

assessments,  premiums or fees, or pay, acquire,  satisfy or discharge any liens
or claims asserted  against the Collateral  (without any obligation to determine

Section      9.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Remedies      Generally;      Power      of
Sale</B>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon  the  occurrence  of any Default and at any time
thereafter,  the Bank shall have all rights and remedies  available at law or in
equity including, without limitation, the rights and remedies of a secured party
under the  Indiana  Uniform  Commercial  Code,  as in  effect  from time to time
(regardless  of  whether  the Code has been  enacted in the  jurisdiction  where
rights or remedies are asserted),  including,  without limitation,  the right to
take possession of the Collateral,  and for that purpose the Bank may, so far as
the Borrower can give authority  therefor,  enter upon any premises on which the
Collateral may be situated and remove the same therefrom. The Bank shall give to
the Borrower at least ten (10)  days&#146;  prior written notice of the time and
place of any public  sale of  Collateral  or of the time after which any private
sale or any  other  intended  disposition  is to be  made.  The  Bank may in its
discretion  transfer any  securities or other property  constituting  Collateral
into its own name or that of its nominee and receive the income thereon and hold
the same as security for Liabilities or apply it on principal or interest due on
Liabilities.  In the event that the Bank takes  possession  of any  Intellectual
Property, the goodwill associated with any trademarks,  tradenames, trade dress,
and service marks of the Borrower shall be transferred to the Bank. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Section   9.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Deposits</B>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any   and   all
Deposit Accounts, deposits or other sums at any time credited by or due from the
Bank to the  Borrower  shall at all times  constitute  security  for any and all
Liabilities,  and the Bank may  apply or set off  such  deposits  or other  sums
against  Liabilities at any time in Default  whether or not the  Liabilities are
then  due or  other  Collateral  is  considered  by  the  Bank  to be  adequate.

Section                    9.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Waiver                    and
Amendment</B>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except  as otherwise expressly set forth herein,
to the extent  permitted by law, the Borrower  waives demand,  notice,  protest,
notice of acceptance of this Security  Agreement,  notice of loans made,  credit
extended,  Collateral  received or  delivered  or other action taken in reliance
hereon and all other  demands and notices of any  description.  With  respect to
both  Liabilities  and  Collateral,  the  Borrower  assents to any  extension or
postponement  of  the  time  of  payment  or  any  other   indulgence,   to  any
substitution,  exchange, or release of Collateral, to the addition or release of
any party or person  primarily  or  secondarily  liable,  to the  acceptance  of
partial  payments  thereon and the  settlement,  compromise or adjustment of any
thereof,  all in such  manner  and at such  time or  times  as the Bank may deem
advisable.  Except as otherwise  provided by law, the Bank shall have no duty as
to the collection or protection of the Collateral,  or any income therefrom, nor
as  to  the  preservation  of  rights  against  prior  parties  nor  as  to  the
preservation of any rights  pertaining  thereto beyond the safe custody thereof.
The Bank may exercise its rights with respect to Collateral without resorting or
regard to other  Collateral or sources of reimbursement  for any Liability.  The
Bank  shall not be  deemed  to have  waived  any of these  rights  upon or under
Liabilities  or  Collateral  unless  such waiver be in writing and signed by the
Bank. No delay or omission on the part of the Bank in exercising any right shall
operate  as a waiver  of such  right or any  other  right.  A waiver  on any one
occasion  shall not be  construed  as a bar to the  exercise of any right on any
future  occasion.  All rights and remedies of the Bank as to the  Liabilities or
Collateral  whether  evidenced hereby or by any other instrument or papers shall
be cumulative and may be exercised  singly,  successively or together.  The Bank
may,  from time to time,  without  notice to the Borrower (a) retain or obtain a
security  interest  in any  property  of any other  Person,  in  addition to the
Collateral,  to secure any of the Liabilities;  (b) retain or obtain the primary
or secondary liability of any party or parties, in addition to the Borrower with
respect to any of the  Liabilities;  (c) extend or renew for any period (whether
or not longer than the original  period) or release or compromise  any liability
of any party or parties  primarily or  secondarily  liable to the Bank under the
Credit  Agreement;  (d) release  its  security  interest in any of the  property
securing any of the Liabilities and permit any  substitution or exchange for any
such  property;  and (e) resort to the  Collateral for the payment of any of the
Liabilities whether or not it shall have resorted to any other property or shall
have proceeded against any party primarily or secondarily  liable for any of the
Liabilities.  The Bank  shall  not,  under  any  circumstances,  or in any event
whatsoever,  have any  liability  for any error or omission or delay of any kind
occurring in the  liquidation  of any  Collateral,  including the  settlement or
collection  of any  Account  or  for  any  damage  resulting  therefrom,  except
liability  resulting  from any act or  omission  by the Bank  which  constitutes
wilful misconduct. This Security Agreement may be amended only by a writing duly
signed by the Bank and the Borrower. </FONT></P>

Borrower&#146;s name on all applications,  documents,  papers,  certificates and
instruments  necessary  or  expedient  for  the  Bank  to use  the  Intellectual
Property,  or  necessary  or  expedient  to  grant  or issue  any  exclusive  or
nonexclusive  license  under  the  Intellectual  Property  to  anyone  else,  or
necessary  or  expedient  for the Bank to assign,  pledge,  convey or  otherwise
transfer title in, or dispose of, the Intellectual  Property to anyone else, for

coupled with an interest,  is irrevocable  until the Liabilities have been fully
satisfied.  Notwithstanding  anything herein to the contrary, no attorney acting
pursuant to this  Section 9.5 shall have any  authority  to confess  judgment on
behalf of the Borrower. </FONT></P>
