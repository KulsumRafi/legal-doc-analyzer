     ARTICLE III - WARRANTY: The Contractor expressly warrants that he is free
from obligation of any other person or persons for services rendered, or

or deception as to location, character of work or materials, estimates of
quantities or other conditions surrounding or being a part of the work and
understands that the quantities given in the Bidding Schedule are approximate
only, and hereby agrees to accept the quantities as actually placed and finally
determined upon the completion of the work, in accordance with the Contract
Documents.
