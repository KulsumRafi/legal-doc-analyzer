                                    RECITALS

      WHEREAS, Centre Capital Group, Inc. ("CCGI") acquired certain first lien,
fixed and adjustable rate, conventional mortgage loans on a servicing-retained
basis from the Servicer, which mortgage loans were either originated or acquired
by the Servicer.

      WHEREAS, such mortgage loans are currently being serviced by the Servicer
for CCGI pursuant to a Master Servicing Agreement for Fixed and Adjustable Rate
Mortgage Loans (the "Master Servicing Agreement"), dated as of May 2000 and
annexed as Exhibit B hereto, by and between CCGI, as owner, and the Servicer, as
servicer.

      WHEREAS, pursuant to the Master Mortgage Loan Purchase and Warranties
Agreement, dated as of February 1, 2002 (the "Master Mortgage Loan Purchase
Agreement"), and annexed as Exhibit C hereto, the Bank has purchased or received
from CCGI all of CCGI's right, title and interest in and to certain of the
mortgage loans currently serviced under the Master Servicing Agreement
(hereinafter, the "Mortgage Loans") and assumed for the benefit of the Servicer
and the obligations of CCGI as owner under such Agreement.

      WHEREAS, the Bank has conveyed certain of the Mortgage Loans, as
identified on Exhibit D hereto (the "Serviced Mortgage Loans"), to Structured
Asset Securities Corporation, a Delaware special purpose corporation ("SASCO"),
which in turn has conveyed the Serviced Mortgage Loans to Citibank, N.A. (the
"Trustee"), pursuant to a trust agreement dated as of February 1, 2003 (the
"Trust Agreement"), among the Trustee, Aurora Loan Services Inc., as master
servicer ("Aurora," and, together with any successor Master Servicer appointed
pursuant to the provisions of the Trust Agreement, the "Master Servicer") and
SASCO.

      WHEREAS, the Bank desires that the Servicer continue to service the
Serviced Mortgage Loans, and the Servicer has agreed to do so, subject to the
rights of the Bank (with the consent of the Master Servicer) to terminate the
rights and obligations of the Servicer hereunder at any time without cause in
accordance with Section 9.02 of the Master Servicing Agreement and to the other
conditions set forth herein.

      WHEREAS, the Bank and the Servicer agree that the provisions of the Master
Servicing Agreement shall continue to apply to the Serviced Mortgage Loans,
except to the extent otherwise provided herein and that this Agreement shall
constitute a Reconstitution Agreement (as such term is defined in the Master
Servicing Agreement) which shall govern the Serviced Mortgage Loans for so long
as such Serviced Mortgage Loans remain subject to the provisions of the Trust
Agreement.

      WHEREAS, the Master Servicer and any successor master servicer shall be
obligated, among other things, to supervise the servicing of the Serviced
Mortgage Loans on behalf of the Trustee, and shall have the right under the
conditions specified herein to terminate for cause the rights and obligations of
the Servicer under this Agreement.

      WHEREAS, the Bank and the Servicer intend that each of the Master Servicer
and the Trustee is an intended third party beneficiary of this Agreement.

      NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual agreements hereinafter set
forth and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of
which are hereby acknowledged, the Bank and the Servicer hereby agree as
follows:

                                    AGREEMENT

      1. Definitions. Capitalized terms used and not defined in this Agreement,
including Exhibit A hereto and any provisions of the Master Servicing Agreement
incorporated by reference herein (regardless of whether such terms are defined
in the Master Servicing Agreement), shall have the meanings ascribed to such
terms in the Trust Agreement.

      2. Servicing. The Servicer agrees, with respect to the Serviced Mortgage
Loans, to perform and observe the duties, responsibilities and obligations that
are to be performed and observed under the provisions of the Master Servicing
Agreement, except as otherwise provided herein and on Exhibit A hereto, and that
the provisions of the Master Servicing Agreement, as so modified, are and shall
be a part of this Agreement to the same extent as if set forth herein in full.

      3. Master Servicing; Termination of Servicer. The Servicer, including any
successor servicer hereunder, shall be subject to the supervision of the Master
Servicer, which Master Servicer shall be obligated to ensure that the Servicer
services the Serviced Mortgage Loans in accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement. The Master Servicer, acting on behalf of the Trustee and the SASCO
2003-7H Trust Fund (the "Trust Fund") created pursuant to the Trust Agreement,
shall have the same rights as the Bank, as owner, under the Master Servicing
Agreement to enforce the obligations of the Servicer under the Master Servicing
Agreement and the term "Owner" as used in the Master Servicing Agreement in
connection with any rights of the Owner shall refer to the Trust Fund or, as the
context requires, the Master Servicer acting in its capacity as agent for the
Trust Fund, except as otherwise specified in Exhibit A hereto. The Master
Servicer shall be entitled to terminate the rights and obligations of the
Servicer under this Agreement upon the failure of the Servicer to perform any of
its obligations under this Agreement, which failure results in an Event of
Default as provided in Section 9.01 of the Master Servicing Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no event shall the Master
Servicer assume any of the obligations of the Bank under the Master Servicing
Agreement; and in connection with the performance of the Master Servicer's
duties hereunder, the parties and other signatories hereto agree that the Master
Servicer shall be entitled to all of the rights, protections and limitations of
liability afforded to the Master Servicer under the Trust Agreement.

      4. Representations. Neither the Servicer nor the Master Servicer shall be
obligated or required to make any representations and warranties regarding the
characteristics of the

            interest payments with respect to the obligations underlying such
            instrument, or (ii) both principal and interest payments derived

            recoverable from collections or other recoveries in respect of such
            Mortgage Loan.

                  (a) be an obligation of an insurance company or other
            corporation whose long-term debt is rated by each Rating Agency in
            one of its two highest rating categories or, if such insurance
            company has no long-term debt, whose claims paying ability is rated
            by each Rating Agency in one of its two highest rating categories,
            and whose short-term debt is rated by each Rating Agency in its
            highest rating category;

                  (b) provide that the Servicer may exercise all of the rights
            under such contract or surety bond without the necessity of taking
            any action by any other Person;

            standing of the obligor under such guaranteed investment contract is
            such that continued investment pursuant to such contract of funds
            would result in a downgrading of any rating of the Servicer, the
            Servicer shall terminate such contract without penalty and be
            entitled to the return of all funds previously invested thereunder,
            together with accrued interest thereon at the interest rate provided

            transferable to any successor servicer or the Master Servicer
            hereunder; and

                  (e) provide that the funds reinvested thereunder and accrued
            interest thereon be returnable to the Custodial Account, as the case

            Agreement, the Servicer shall not make or permit any modification,
            waiver or amendment of any term of any Mortgage Loan that would

            basis of such examination conducted substantially in compliance with
            the Uniform Single Attestation Program for Mortgage Bankers, such
            firm is of the opinion that Servicer's overall servicing operations
            have been conducted in compliance with the Uniform Single
            Attestation Program for Mortgage Bankers except for such exceptions

            fulfillment of all such obligations, specifying each such default
            known to such officer and the nature and status thereof including
            the steps being taken by the Servicer to remedy such default.

            servicing of the Company or any officer to whom that officer

            matters:


                                      A-8
<PAGE>

                        (1) I have reviewed the information required to be
                  delivered to the Master Servicer pursuant to the Agreement
                  (the "Servicing Information").

                        (2) Based on my knowledge, the information relating to
                  the Mortgage Loans submitted by the Company in its monthly
                  reporting packages delivered to the Master Servicer which is
                  contained in the reports on Form 8-K and the annual report on
                  Form 10-K with respect to the Transaction, taken as a whole,
                  does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
                  omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements
                  made, in light of the circumstances under which such
                  statements were made, not misleading as of the date of this
                  certification;

                        (3) Based on my knowledge, the Servicing Information
                  required to be provided to the Master Servicer by the Company
                  under this Agreement has been provided to the Master Servicer;

                        (4) I am responsible for reviewing the activities
                  performed by the Company under this Agreement and based upon
                  the review required hereunder, and except as disclosed in the
                  Annual Statement of Compliance, the Annual Independent
                  Certified Public Accountant's Servicing Report and all
                  servicing reports, officer's certificates and other
                  information relating to the servicing of the Mortgage Loans
                  submitted to the Master Servicer, the Company has, as of this
                  certification fulfilled its obligations under this Agreement;
                  and

                        (5) I have disclosed to the Master Servicer and the
                  Depositor all significant deficiencies relating to the
                  Company's compliance with the minimum servicing standards in
                  accordance with a review conducted in compliance with the
                  Uniform Single Attestation Program for Mortgage Bankers or
                  similar standard as set forth in this Agreement.

                  (b) The Company shall indemnify and hold harmless the Master
            Servicer and the Depositor and their respective officers, directors,
            agents and affiliates from and against any losses, damages,
            penalties, fines, forfeitures, reasonable legal fees and related
            costs, judgments and other costs and expenses arising out of or
            based upon a breach by the Company or any of its officers,
            directors, agents or affiliates of its obligations under this
            Section 5.08 any material misstatement or omission in the Officer's
            Certificate required under this Section or the negligence, bad faith
            or willful misconduct of the Company in connection therewith. If the
            indemnification provided for herein is unavailable or insufficient
            to hold harmless the Master Servicer and the Depositor, then the
            Company agrees that it shall contribute to the amount paid or
            payable by the Master Servicer and the Depositor as a result of the
            losses, claims, damages or liabilities of the Master Servicer and
            the Depositor in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the
            relative fault of the Master Servicer and the Depositor on


                                      A-9

            breach of the Company's obligations under this Section 5.08, any
            material misstatement or omission in the Officer's Certificate
            required under this Section or the Company's negligence, bad faith
            or willful misconduct in connection therewith.

29.   The second, third and fourth paragraphs of Section 6.02 (Remedies for
      Breach of Representations and Warranties of the Servicer) are hereby
      restated to read as follows:

                  Within 60 days of the earlier of either discovery by or notice
            to the Servicer of any breach of a representation or warranty set
            forth in Section 6.01 which materially and adversely affects the
            ability of the Servicer to perform its duties and obligations under
            this Agreement or otherwise materially and adversely affects the
            value of the Mortgage Loans, the Mortgaged Property or the priority
            of the security interest on such Mortgaged Property, the Servicer
            shall use its best efforts promptly to cure such Breach in all
            material respects and, if such Breach cannot be cured, the Servicer
            shall, at the Trustee's option, assign the Servicer's rights and
            obligations under this Agreement (or respecting the affected
            Mortgage Loans) to a successor Servicer selected by the Trustee with
            the prior consent and approval of the Master Servicer. Such
            assignment shall be made in accordance with Section 10.01.

                  In addition, the Servicer shall indemnify (from its own funds)
            the Trustee, the Trust Fund and the Master Servicer and hold each of
            them harmless against any costs resulting from any claim, demand,
            defense or assertion based on or grounded upon, or resulting from, a
            Breach of the Servicer's representations and warranties contained in
            this Agreement. It is understood and agreed that the remedies set
            forth in this Section 6.02 constitute the sole remedies of the
            Master Servicer, the Trust Fund and the Trustee respecting a breach
            of the foregoing representations and warranties.

                  Any cause of action against the Servicer relating to or
            arising out of the Breach of any representations and warranties made
            in Section 6.01 shall accrue upon (i) discovery of such Breach by
            the Servicer or notice thereof by the Trustee or Master Servicer to
            the Servicer, (ii) failure by the Servicer to cure such breach
            within the applicable cure period, and (iii) demand upon the
            Servicer by the Trustee or the Master Servicer for compliance with
            this Agreement.

      Loans from Inclusion Under the Agreement Upon a Pass-Through Transfer or a

                  The Servicer shall indemnify the Trust Fund, the Trustee and
            the Master Servicer and hold each of them harmless against any and
            all claims, losses, damages, penalties, fines, forfeitures,
            reasonable and necessary legal fees and related costs, judgments,
            and any other costs, fees and expenses that any of such parties may

            its duties and service the Mortgage Loans in strict compliance with
            the terms of this Agreement. The Servicer immediately shall notify
            the Bank, the Master Servicer and the Trustee or any other relevant
            party if a claim is made by a third party with respect to this
            Agreement or the Mortgage Loans, assume (with the prior written
            consent of the indemnified party) the defense of any such claim and
            pay all expenses in connection therewith, including counsel fees,
            and promptly pay, discharge and satisfy any judgment or decree which
            may be entered against it or any of such parties in respect of such
            claim. The Servicer shall follow any written instructions received
            from the Trustee in connection with such claim. The Trustee from the
            assets of the Trust Fund promptly shall reimburse the Servicer for
            all amounts advanced by it pursuant to the preceding sentence except
            when the claim is in any way related to the Servicer's
            indemnification pursuant to Section 6.02, or the failure of the
            Servicer to service and administer the Mortgage Loans in strict
            compliance with the terms of this Agreement.

                  The Trust Fund shall indemnify the Servicer and hold it
            harmless against any and all claims, losses, damages, penalties,
            fines, forfeitures, reasonable and necessary legal fees and related
            costs, judgments, and any other costs, fees and expenses that the
            Servicer may sustain in any way related to the failure of the
            Trustee or the Master Servicer to perform its duties in compliance
            with the terms of this Agreement.

                  In the event a dispute arises between an indemnified party and
            the Servicer with respect to any of the rights and obligations of
            the parties pursuant to this Agreement and such dispute is
            adjudicated in a court of law, by an arbitration panel or any other
            judicial process, then the losing party shall indemnify and
            reimburse the winning party for all attorney's fees and other costs
            and expenses related to the adjudication of said dispute.

32.   Section 8.02 is hereby amended by changing the word "Owner" to "Trustee"
      where it appears in the proviso to the third sentence thereof and the word
      "Owner" to "Trust Fund" in the fourth sentence of such Section.

33.   The first paragraph of Section 8.03 (Limitation on Resignation and
      Assignment by Servicer) is hereby amended in its entirety to read as
      follows:

                  The Servicer shall neither assign this Agreement or the
            servicing hereunder or delegate its rights or duties hereunder or
            any portion hereof (to other than a third party in the case of
            outsourcing routine tasks such as taxes, insurance and property
            inspection, in which case the Servicer shall fully liable for such
            tasks as if the Servicer performed them itself) or sell or otherwise
            dispose of all or substantially all of its property or assets
            without the prior written consent of the


                                      A-11
<PAGE>

            Trustee and the Master Servicer, which consent shall be granted or
            withheld in the reasonable discretion of such parties, provided,
            however, that the Servicer may assign its rights and obligations
            hereunder without prior written consent of the Trustee and the
            Master Servicer to any entity that is directly owned or controlled
            by the Servicer, and the Servicer guarantees the performance of such
            entity hereunder. In the event of such assignment by the Servicer,
            the Servicer shall provide the Trustee and the Master Servicer with
            a written statement guaranteeing the successor entity's performance
            of the Servicer's obligations under the Agreement.

      References to "Owner" in the second and third paragraph of Section 8.03
shall refer to the "Master Servicer acting at the direction, or with the prior
consent of, the Trustee".

34.   Section 9.01 is hereby amended by changing the references to "Owner" in
      the third and fourth paragraph of such section to "Master Servicer."

35.   Section 9.02 (Termination Without Cause) is hereby amended in its entirety
      to read as follows:

            Section 9.02 Termination Without Cause.

                  This Agreement shall terminate upon: (i) the later of (a) the
            distribution of the final payment or liquidation proceeds on the
            last Mortgage Loan to the Owner (or advances by the Servicer for the
            same), and (b) the disposition of all REO Property acquired upon
            foreclosure of the last Mortgage Loan and the remittance of all
            funds due hereunder, or (ii) mutual consent of the Servicer, the
            Bank and the Master Servicer in writing or (iii) at the sole option
            of the Bank, without cause, upon 30 days written notice. Any such
            notice of termination shall be in writing and delivered to the
            Servicer by registered mail to the address set forth at the
            beginning of this Agreement. The Master Servicer, the Trustee and
            the Servicer shall comply with the termination procedures set forth
            in Sections 10.01 and 10.03 hereof and the procedures set forth
            below, provided that, in the event the Bank terminates this
            Agreement without cause in accordance with subclause (iii) above,
            the Bank shall pay the Servicer a termination fee equal to 2.0% of
            the aggregate unpaid balance of the Mortgage Loans as of such
            termination date.

                  In connection with any such termination referred to in clause
            (ii) or (iii) above, the Bank will be responsible for reimbursing
            the Servicer for all unreimbursed out-of-pocket Servicing Advances
            within 15 Business Days following the date of termination and other
            reasonable and necessary out-of-pocket costs associated with any
            transfer of servicing.

                  Notwithstanding and in addition to the foregoing, in the event
            that (i) a Mortgage Loan becomes delinquent for a period of 90 days
            or more (a "Delinquent Mortgage Loan") or (ii) a Mortgage Loan
            becomes an REO Property, the Bank may at its election terminate this
            Agreement (a) with respect to such Delinquent Mortgage Loan or (b)
            REO Property, in each case, upon 15 days'


                                      A-12
<PAGE>

            written notice to the Servicer. In the event of such election, the
            Bank shall reimburse the Servicer for all unreimbursed out-of-pocket
            Servicing Advances and Monthly Advances on the date of termination
            and other reasonable and necessary out-of-pocket costs associated
            with any transfer of servicing, including, but not limited to, costs
            associated with the transfer of the related files to the Owner's
            designee.

36.   Section 10.01 (Successor to the Servicer) is hereby amended in its
      entirety to read as follows:

                  Simultaneously with the termination of the Servicer's
            responsibilities and duties under this Agreement (a) pursuant to
            Sections 6.02, 7.03, 8.03, 9.01 or 9.02, the Master Servicer shall,
            in accordance with the provisions of the Trust Agreement (i) succeed
            to and assume all of the Servicer's responsibilities, rights, duties
            and obligations under this Agreement, or (ii) appoint a successor
            servicer meeting the eligibility requirements of this Agreement set
            forth in Sections 8.01(i) and (ii) and which shall succeed to all
            rights and assume all of the responsibilities, duties and
            liabilities of the Servicer under this Agreement with the
            termination of the Servicer's responsibilities, duties and
            liabilities under this Agreement. Any successor to the Servicer that
            is not at that time a Servicer of other mortgage loans for the Trust
            Fund shall be subject to the approval of the Master Servicer, the
            Bank, the Trustee and each Rating Agency (as such term is defined in
            the Trust Agreement). Unless the successor servicer is at that time
            a Servicer of other mortgage loans for the Trust Fund, each Rating
            Agency must deliver to the Trustee a letter to the effect that such
            transfer of servicing will not result in a qualification, withdrawal
            or downgrade of the then-current rating of any of the Certificates.
            In connection with such appointment and assumption, the Master
            Servicer or the Depositor, as applicable, may make such arrangements
            for the compensation of such successor out of payments on the
            Mortgage Loans as it and such successor shall agree; provided,
            however, that no such compensation shall be in excess of that
            permitted the Servicer under this Agreement. In the event that the
            Servicer's duties, responsibilities and liabilities under this
            Agreement should be terminated pursuant to the aforementioned
            sections, the Servicer shall discharge such duties and
            responsibilities during the period from the date it acquires
            knowledge of such termination until the effective date thereof with
            the same degree of diligence and prudence which it is obligated to
            exercise under this Agreement, and shall take no action whatsoever
            that might impair or prejudice the rights or financial condition of
            its successor. The resignation or removal of the Servicer pursuant
            to the aforementioned sections shall not become effective until a
            successor shall be appointed pursuant to this Section 10.01 and
            shall in no event relieve the Servicer of the representations and
            warranties made pursuant to Section 6.01 and the remedies available
            to the Trustee under Sections 6.02 and 7.03, it being understood and
            agreed that the provisions of such Sections 6.01, 6.02 and 7.03
            shall be applicable to the Servicer notwithstanding any such
            resignation or termination of the Servicer, or the termination of
            this Agreement.

                  Within a reasonable period of time, but in no event longer
            than 30 days of


                                      A-13
<PAGE>

            the appointment of a successor entity, the Servicer shall prepare,
            execute and deliver to the successor entity any and all documents
            and other instruments, place in such successor's possession all
            Servicing Files, and do or cause to be done all other acts or things
            necessary or appropriate to effect the purposes of such notice of
            termination. The Servicer shall cooperate with the Trustee and the
            Master Servicer, as applicable, and such successor in effecting the
            termination of the Servicer's responsibilities and rights hereunder
            and the transfer of servicing responsibilities to the successor
            Servicer, including without limitation, the transfer to such
            successor for administration by it of all cash amounts which shall
            at the time be credited by the Servicer to the Custodial Account or
            any Escrow Account or thereafter received with respect to the
            Mortgage Loans.

                  Any successor appointed as provided herein shall execute,
            acknowledge and deliver to the Trustee, the Servicer and the Master
            Servicer an instrument (i) accepting such appointment, wherein the
            successor shall make the representations and warranties set forth in
            Section 6.01 and (ii) an assumption of the due and punctual
            performance and observance of each covenant and condition to be
            performed and observed by the Servicer under this Agreement,
            whereupon such successor shall become fully vested with all the
            rights, powers, duties, responsibilities, obligations and
            liabilities of the Servicer, with like effect as if originally named
            as a party to this Agreement. Any termination or resignation of the
            Servicer or termination of this Agreement pursuant to Sections 9.01
            and 9.02 shall not affect any claims that the Master Servicer or the
            Trustee may have against the Servicer arising out of the Servicer's
            actions or failure to act prior to any such termination or
            resignation.

                  The Servicer shall deliver (i) within three (3) Business Days
            to the successor Servicer the funds in the Custodial Account and
            Escrow Account and (ii) within 30 Business Days all Mortgage Loan
            Documents and related documents and statements held by it hereunder
            and the Servicer shall account for all funds and shall execute and
            deliver such instruments and do such other things as may reasonably
            be required to more fully and definitively vest in the successor all
            such rights, powers, duties, responsibilities, obligations and
            liabilities of the Servicer.

                  Upon a successor's acceptance of appointment as such, the
            Servicer shall notify the Trustee and Master Servicer of such
            appointment in accordance with the notice procedures set forth
            herein.

                  Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, all reasonable
            costs and expenses incurred in connection with any transfer of
            servicing hereunder as a result of a termination of the Servicer for
            cause pursuant to Section 9.01 of the Agreement, including, without
            limitation, the costs and expenses of the Master Servicer or any
            other Person in appointing a successor servicer, or of the Master
            Servicer in assuming the responsibilities of the Servicer hereunder,
            or of transferring the Servicing Files and the other necessary data
            to the successor servicer shall be paid by the terminated, removed
            or resigning Servicer from its


                                      A-14
<PAGE>

            own funds without reimbursement.

37.   The parties hereto acknowledge that Section 10.02 (Closing), Section 10.03
      (Closing Documents), Section 10.07 (Notices) and Section 10.16 (Exhibits)
      are inapplicable to this Agreement.

38.   A new Section 10.19 is hereby added to the Master Servicing Agreement to
      read as follows:

            Section 10.19 Intended Third Party Beneficiaries.

                  Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, the
            parties to this Agreement agree that it is appropriate, in
            furtherance of the intent of such parties as set forth herein, that
            the Master Servicer and the Trustee receive the benefit of the
            provisions of this Agreement as intended third party beneficiaries
            of this Agreement to the extent of such provisions. The Servicer
            shall have the same obligations to the Master Servicer and the
            Trustee as if they were parties to this Agreement, and the Master
            Servicer and the Trustee shall have the same rights and remedies to
            enforce the provisions of this Agreement as if they were parties to
            this Agreement. The Servicer shall only take direction from the
            Master Servicer (if direction by the Master Servicer is required
            under this Agreement) unless otherwise directed by this Agreement.
            Notwithstanding the foregoing, all rights and obligations of the
            Master Servicer and the Trustee hereunder (other than the right to
            indemnification) shall terminate upon termination of the Trust
            Agreement and of the Trust Fund pursuant to the Trust Agreement.
