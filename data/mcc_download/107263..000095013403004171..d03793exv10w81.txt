obligation of the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with its
terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by general principles of

party, or any order, judgment, rule or regulation of any Governmental Entity
having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its subsidiaries or over their

prescribed or permitted by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

legal, administrative or other governmental investigation, inquiry or proceeding
(whether federal, state, local or foreign) pending or, to the best of the
Company's knowledge, threatened against or affecting the Company or any
subsidiary or any of their respective properties, assets or businesses which,

or prevent or materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated

rules of any applicable self-regulatory organization recognized by the SEC),
rulings, written interpretations, judgments, orders, injunctions, decrees,
arbitration awards, agency requirements, licenses or permits of any Governmental
Entity of competent jurisdiction (collectively, "Laws"), except as disclosed in
the Company Reports filed on or before the date hereof and except where the
failure to so comply would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect. Except as disclosed in the Company Reports filed on or before the date
hereof, neither the Company nor its subsidiaries has received written notice of
a violation of any Law, which, if violated, would reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect. Except as set forth in Schedule 3.9 or as set forth
in the Company Reports filed prior to the date hereof and for regulatory
examinations or reviews conducted in the ordinary course, no material
investigation or review by any Governmental Entity with respect to the Company
or any of its subsidiaries is as of the date hereof pending or, to the knowledge
of the Company, threatened, which would reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

         (b) The Company and its subsidiaries have all licenses, permits,
franchises or other governmental authorizations (collectively, "Permits")
necessary for the ownership of their assets or properties or for the conduct of
their respective businesses, except for those Permits which, if violated or not
obtained, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         3.10. Material Contracts

         (a) Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries is in default (or
would be in default with notice or lapse of time, or both) under, is in
violation (or would be in violation with notice or lapse of time, or both) of,
or has otherwise breached, any Material Contract which default, alone or in the
aggregate with all other such defaults, would reasonably be expected to have a

Contract to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party is in full
force and effect and is binding upon the Company or its subsidiary and, to the
best of the Company's knowledge, is binding upon such other parties, in each
case in accordance with its terms. There are no unresolved disputes involving
the Company or any of its subsidiaries under any Material Contract which if
resolved in a manner adverse to the Company would reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect. "Material Contract" means any Contract that is
material to the properties, assets, liabilities, financial condition, business,
operations or net income of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, including the

for which the Company would have any material liability that is intended to be
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code is so qualified in all material
respects and nothing has occurred, whether by action or by failure to act, which
would reasonably be expected to cause the loss of such qualification.

Company or its subsidiaries in violation of any Environmental Laws or which

Material Adverse Effect; and (ii) there has been no material spill, discharge,

Governmental Entity or private entity with respect to any liability or alleged
liability under any Environmental Law, nor to the knowledge of the Company has

<PAGE>

necessary to authorize the execution, delivery and performance of the
Transaction Documents by the Purchaser or MidAmerican and each of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.

         (b) This Agreement constitutes, and upon execution and delivery the
Registration Rights Agreement shall constitute, a valid and binding obligation

MidAmerican's organizational documents, any material Contract to which the
Purchaser or MidAmerican is a party, or any order, judgment, rule or regulation

$1.00 per share, of the Company, the Company will cancel any such share or
shares as soon as reasonably practicable after it is permitted to do so under

Share Trust, and the Company. The Company will use its reasonable best efforts

         (a) The Purchaser covenants that it will not sell or otherwise transfer
the Shares (or any shares of Common Stock acquired upon conversion of the
Shares)to any Person except pursuant to an effective registration under the
Securities Act or in a transaction which, in the opinion of counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the Company, qualifies as an exempt transaction under the
Securities Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.

         (b) The certificates evidencing the Shares and the shares of Common
Stock issuable upon conversion of the Shares will bear the following legend
reflecting the foregoing restrictions on the transfer of such securities:

         "THE SECURITIES EVIDENCED HEREBY HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE
         SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE "ACT'), AND MAY NOT BE
         TRANSFERRED EXCEPT PURSUANT TO AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION UNDER THE ACT
         OR IN A TRANSACTION WHICH, IN THE OPINION OF COUNSEL REASONABLY
         SATISFACTORY TO THE COMPANY, QUALIFIES AS AN EXEMPT TRANSACTION UNDER
         THE ACT AND THE RULES AND REGULATIONS PROMULGATED THEREUNDER."

The Company shall remove this legend from the certificates evidencing such
securities as promptly as practicable following the registration of such
securities under the Securities Act or such earlier time as such securities are
no longer subject to restriction on transfer under the Securities Act.

         On or prior to the Closing Date, neither party shall, nor shall it
permit its affiliates to, issue or cause the publication of any press release or
other announcement with respect to this Agreement or the transactions

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event any such press release or

consult in good faith with the other party prior to the issuance of any such
press release or announcement.

         11.4. Submission to Jurisdiction

may assign any of its rights (but not its obligations) under this Agreement to
one or more of the wholly-owned subsidiaries of MidAmerican (so long as such
assignment does not delay the Closing or impose any additional costs on the
Company), it being understood that such assignment will not release Purchaser
from its obligations hereunder. In the event of any assignment in accordance

bound by the provisions of the Agreement by executing and agreeing to an
assumption agreement reasonably acceptable to the Company.

Transaction Documents and the Certificate of Designation other than those
expressly set forth herein or in the Schedules, exhibits, certificates and other
documents delivered in accordance herewith or therewith. The Transaction
Documents and the Certificate of Designation supersede all prior negotiations,
discussions, correspondence, communications, understandings and agreements
between the parties relating to the subject matter of the Transaction Documents
and the Certificate of Designation and all prior drafts of the Transaction
Documents and the Certificate of Designation, all of which are merged into the
final executed versions of the Transaction Documents and the Certificate of
Designation, as the case may be. No prior drafts of the Transaction Documents
and the Certificate of Designation and no words or phrases from any such prior
drafts shall be admissible into evidence in any action or suit involving the
final executed versions of the Transaction Documents and the Certificate of
Designation, as the case maybe.

         11.7. Severability

parties hereto intend that there shall be added as a part of this Agreement a
provision as similar in terms to such invalid or unenforceable provision as may
be possible and be valid and enforceable.

parties will confirm facsimile transmission by signing a duplicate original
document. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of
which shall be deemed an original and all of which together shall be considered
one and the same agreement.

this Agreement.

         11.10. Guarantee

         SECTION 2. REGISTRATION RIGHTS

         (a) Demand Registration.

                  (i) Request for Registration. Upon the written request of one
         or more Holders of not less than 20% of the Registrable Securities
         (calculated on an as-converted basis) (the "Requesting Holders") that
         the Company effect the registration of all or a part of such Holders'
         Registrable Securities (which request shall specify the intended method
         of disposition of such Registrable Securities) (a "Demand
         Registration"), the Company will:

                  (1) promptly give written notice of the proposed registration
         to all other Holders; and

                  (2) as soon as reasonably possible, use its reasonable best
         efforts to effect such registration (including, without limitation, the
         execution of an undertaking to file post-effective amendments,
         appropriate qualification under applicable blue sky or other state
         securities laws and appropriate compliance with applicable regulations
         issued under the Securities Act) as may be so requested and as would
         permit or facilitate the sale and distribution (in accordance with the
         intended methods as aforesaid) of such Registrable Securities as are
         specified in such request, together with all or such portion of the
         Registrable Securities of any Holder or Holders joining in such request
         as are specified in a written request received by the Company within 15
         days after written notice from the Company is given under Section
         2(a)(i)(1) above; provided that the Company shall not be obligated to
         effect, or take any action to effect, any such registration pursuant to
         this Section 2(a):

                           (A) If such registration is prohibited by applicable
                  law;

                           (B) For a period of 30 days before the anticipated
                  consummation of a public offering by the Company of its equity
                  securities and 90 days subsequent to the consummation of such
                  public offering;

                           (C) In any particular jurisdiction in which the
                  Company would be required to execute a general consent to
                  service of process in effecting such registration,
                  qualification or compliance, unless the Company is already
                  subject to service in such jurisdiction and except as may be
                  required by the Securities Act or applicable rules or
                  regulations thereunder;

                           (D) After the Company has effected three (3) Demand
                  Registrations pursuant to this Section 2(a) and such
                  registrations have been declared or ordered effective and the
                  sales of such Registrable Securities shall have closed;

                           (E) If the Registrable Securities requested by all
                  Holders to be registered pursuant to such request do not
                  constitute at least 20% of the Registrable Securities
                  (calculated on an as-converted basis);


                                      -3-
<PAGE>

                           (F) Within 90 days after the effective date of a
                  previous Demand Registration or a previous registration under
                  which the Requesting Holders had piggyback rights pursuant to
                  Section 2(b) hereof wherein the Requesting Holders were
                  permitted to register, and sold, at least 50% of the
                  Registrable Securities requested to be included therein;

                           (G) If the Company shall furnish to the Requesting
                  Holders a certificate signed by the President of the Company
                  stating that in the good faith judgment of the Board of
                  Directors it would be in the best interests of the Company to
                  defer such Demand Registration because such registration would
                  jeopardize any other material corporate transaction of the
                  Company or would require the disclosure of material non-public
                  information, then the Company shall have the right to defer
                  filing a registration statement for such Demand Registration
                  for a period not to exceed sixty (60) days from the date of
                  receipt of written request from the Requesting Holders;
                  provided, however, that the Company shall not exercise such
                  right more than once in any (12) twelve-month period.

         The registration rights set forth in this Section 2 may be assigned, in
whole or in part, to any transferee of Registrable Securities (who shall be
bound by all obligations of this Agreement).

                  (ii) Underwriting. If the Holders intend to distribute the
         Registrable Securities covered by their request by means of an
         underwriting, they shall so advise the Company as a part of their
         request made pursuant to Section 2(a). The Holders whose shares are to
         be included in such registration and the Company shall enter into an
         underwriting agreement in customary form (including in the case of the
         Company customary indemnification and contribution) with the
         representative of the underwriter or underwriters selected for such
         underwriting by the Holders of more than 50% of the Registrable
         Securities (calculated on an as-converted basis) to be registered and
         reasonably acceptable to the Company. The Holders may, at their option,
         require that any or all of the representations and warranties by, and
         the other agreements on the part of, the Company to and for the benefit
         of such underwriters shall also be made to and for the benefit of such
         Holders and that any or all of the conditions precedent to the
         obligations of such underwriters under such underwriting agreement be
         conditions precedent to the obligations of such Holders. Any such
         Holder shall not be required to make any representations or warranties
         to or agreements with the Company or the underwriters other than
         representations, warranties or agreements regarding such Holder, such
         Holder's Registrable Securities and such Holder's intended method of
         distribution and any other representation required by law.

                  (iii) Priority on Demand Registration. Notwithstanding any
         other provision of this Section 2(a), whenever the Company shall effect
         a Demand Registration pursuant to this Section 2(a) in connection with
         an underwritten offering by one or more Holders of Registrable
         Securities, if the representative of the underwriter or underwriters
         selected for such underwriting advises the Company and the Holders in
         writing that in their opinion the number of shares of Registrable
         Securities proposed to be included in



                                      -4-
<PAGE>

         any such registration exceeds the number of securities which can be
         sold in such offering, the number of shares included in such
         registration by the Holders shall be reduced to such number of shares
         of Registrable Securities which in the opinion of such representative
         can be sold. If the number of shares which can be sold is less than the
         number of shares of Registrable Securities proposed to be registered,
         the amount of Registrable Securities to be so sold shall be allocated
         first, to the shares of Registrable Securities requested to be
         registered by the Requesting Holders and then pro rata among the other
         Holders of Registrable Securities desiring to participate in such
         registration on the basis of the amount of such Registrable Securities
         initially proposed to be registered by such other Holders. No
         Registrable Securities excluded from the underwriting by reason of the
         underwriter's marketing limitation shall be included in such
         registration.

                  (iv) Inclusion of Other Shares in Underwritten Demand
         Registration. Whenever the Company shall effect a registration pursuant
         to this Section 2(a) in connection with an underwritten offering by one
         or more Holders of Registrable Securities, no securities other than
         Registrable Securities shall be included among the securities covered
         by such registration unless the managing underwriter of such offering
         shall have advised each holder of Registrable Securities to be covered
         by such registration in writing that the inclusion of such other
         securities would not adversely affect such offering. If the managing
         underwriter shall thereafter advise the Company and the Holders that
         the inclusion of some or all of such securities would adversely affect
         such offering, the Company shall include in such registration and
         offering: (i) first, the Registrable Securities, in accordance with
         Section 2(a)(iii) and (ii) second, to the extent additional securities
         may be included, the securities of the Company and the Other
         Stockholders, in such relative amounts as they shall agree, or failing
         agreement, as the managing underwriter shall advise.

                  (v) Registration Statement Form. Registrations under this
         Section 2(a) shall be on such appropriate registration form of the
         Commission (i) as shall be selected by the Holders of more than 50% of
         the Registrable Securities so to be registered and as shall be
         reasonably acceptable to the Company and (ii) as shall permit the
         disposition of such Registrable Securities in accordance with the
         intended method or methods of disposition specified in their request
         for such registration. The Company agrees to include in any such
         registration statement all information which, in the opinion of counsel
         to the holders of Registrable Securities and counsel to the Company, is
         required to be included.

         (b) Piggyback Registration.

                  (i) If the Company shall determine to register any of its
         equity securities (other than Registrable Securities) under the
         Securities Act either for its own account or for the account of Other
         Stockholders, other than a registration relating solely to employee
         benefit plans, or a registration relating solely to a Commission Rule
         145 transaction, or a registration on any registration form which does
         not permit secondary sales or does not include substantially the same
         information as would be required to be included in a registration
         statement covering the sale of Registrable Securities (a "Piggyback
         Registration"), the Company will:



                                      -5-
<PAGE>

                  (1) promptly give to each of the Holders a written notice
         thereof (which shall include a list of the jurisdictions in which the
         Company intends to attempt to qualify such securities under the
         applicable blue sky or other state securities laws); and

                  (2) subject to Section 2(b)(iii) below, include in such
         registration (and any related qualification under blue sky laws or
         other compliance), and in any underwriting of equity securities
         involved therein, all the Registrable Securities specified in a written
         request or requests, made by the Holders within fifteen (15) days after
         receipt of the written notice from the Company described in clause (i)
         above. Such written request may specify all or a part of the Holders'
         Registrable Securities. The Company may postpone or withdraw the filing
         or effectiveness of a Piggyback Registration at any time in its sole
         discretion.

                  (ii) Underwriting. If the registration of which the Company
         gives notice pursuant to Section 2(b)(i)(1) is for a registered public
         offering involving an underwriting of equity securities, the Company
         shall so advise each of the Holders as a part of such notice. In such
         event, the right of each of the Holders to registration pursuant to
         this Section 2(b) shall be conditioned upon such Holders' participation
         in such underwriting and the inclusion of such Holders' Registrable
         Securities in the underwriting to the extent provided herein. If any
         Piggyback Registration is an underwritten primary offering of equity
         securities, the Company shall have the sole right to select the
         managing underwriter or underwriters to administer any such offering.
         The Holders whose shares are to be included in such registration shall
         (together with the Company and the Other Stockholders distributing
         their securities through such underwriting) enter into an underwriting
         agreement in customary form (including in the case of the Company
         customary indemnification and contribution) with the representative of
         the underwriter or underwriters selected for underwriting by the
         Company. The Holders may, at their option, require that any or all of
         the representations and warranties by, and the other agreements on the
         part of, the Company to and for the benefit of such underwriters shall
         also be made to and for the benefits of such Holders and that any or
         all of the conditions precedent to the obligations of such underwriters
         under such underwriting agreement be conditions precedent to the
         obligations of such Holders. Any such Holder shall not be required to
         make any representations or warranties to or agreements with the
         Company or the underwriters other than representations, warranties or
         agreements regarding such Holder, such Holder's Registrable Securities
         and such Holder's intended method of distribution and any other
         representation required by law.

                  (iii) Priority on Piggyback Registrations. The number of
         equity securities requested to be included in such Piggyback
         Registration shall be subject to the following allocation priority:

                          (1) If a Piggyback Registration is an underwritten
         primary registration of equity securities on behalf of the Company, and
         the managing underwriters advise the Company in writing that in their
         opinion the number of securities requested to be included in such
         registration exceeds the number of equity securities which can be sold
         in such offering, the Company shall include in such registration (i)
         first, the equity securities the Company proposes to sell, (ii) second,
         the Registrable Securities requested to be



                                      -6-
<PAGE>

         included therein by the Holders, pro rata among such Holders on the
         basis of the number of shares requested to be registered by such
         Holders or as such Holders may otherwise agree and (iii) third, other
         equity securities requested to be included in such registration by
         Other Stockholders.

                  (2) If Piggyback Registration is an underwritten secondary
         registration of equity securities on behalf of Other Stockholders of
         the Company's securities, and the managing underwriters shall advise
         the Company in writing that in their opinion the number of equity
         securities requested to be included in such registration exceeds the
         number of equity securities which can be sold in such offering, the
         Company shall include in such registration (i) first, the equity
         securities proposed to be included therein by the holders requesting
         such registration, (ii) second, the equity securities requested to be
         included in such registration by the Company; (iii) third, the
         Registrable Securities requested to be included therein by the Holders,
         pro rata among such Holders on the basis of the number of shares
         requested to be registered by such Holders or as such Holders may
         otherwise agree and (iv) fourth, other equity securities requested to
         be included in such registration by Other Stockholders not otherwise
         included in clause (i) above.

                  The Company shall so advise all holders of securities
         requesting registration, and the number of shares of equity securities
         that are entitled to be included in any such registration. If the
         Holder disapproves of the terms of any such underwriting, he may elect
         to withdraw therefrom by written notice to the Company and the
         underwriter. Any Registrable Securities or other equity securities
         excluded or withdrawn from such underwriting shall be withdrawn from
         such registration. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if
         the Company has previously filed a registration statement with respect
         to Registrable Securities pursuant to Section 2(a) hereof or pursuant
         to this Section 2(b), and if such previous registration has not been
         withdrawn or abandoned, the Company shall not be obligated to cause to
         become effective any other registration of any of its securities under
         the Securities Act, whether on its own behalf or at the request of any
         holder or holders of such securities, until a period of at least three
         months has elapsed from the effective date of such previous
         registration.

                  The registration of convertible debt and the underlying equity
         securities into which such debt converts shall not be deemed a
         registration of equity securities for purposes of this Section 2(b).

         (c) Expenses of Registration. All Registration Expenses incurred in
connection with any registration, qualification or compliance pursuant to this
Section 2 shall be borne by the Company, and all Selling Expenses shall be borne
by the Holders of the securities so registered pro rata on the basis of the
number of their shares so registered.

         (d) Registration Procedures. In the case of each registration effected
by the Company pursuant to this Section 2, the Company will keep the Holders, as
applicable, advised in writing as to the initiation of each registration and as
to the completion thereof. At its expense, the Company will as soon as
reasonably possible:



                                      -7-
<PAGE>

                  (i) prepare and file with the Commission the requisite
         registration statement to effect such registration as soon as
         reasonably possible and, in any event, in the case of a registration
         pursuant to Section 2(a), not later than thirty (30) days after receipt
         of the registration request from the Requesting Holders and thereafter
         use its reasonable best efforts to cause such registration statement to
         become effective as soon as reasonably possible;

                  (ii) use its reasonable best efforts to keep such registration
         effective for a period of one hundred twenty (120) days or until the
         Holders, as applicable, have completed the distribution described in
         the registration statement relating thereto, whichever first occurs;
         provided, however, that (A) such 120-day period shall be extended for a
         period of time equal to the period during which the Holders refrain
         from selling any securities included in such registration in accordance
         with provisions in Section 2(d)(vii) hereof; and (B) in the case of any
         registration of Registrable Securities on Form S-3 which are intended
         to be offered on a continuous or delayed basis, such 120-day period
         shall be extended until all such Registrable Securities are sold, but
         in any event not exceeding two years, provided that Rule 415, or any
         successor rule under the Securities Act, permits an offering on a
         continuous or delayed basis, and provided further that applicable rules
         under the Securities Act governing the obligation to file a
         post-effective amendment permit, in lieu of filing a post-effective
         amendment which (y) includes any prospectus required by Section 10(a)
         of the Securities Act or (z) reflects facts or events representing a
         material or fundamental change in the information set forth in the
         registration statement, the incorporation by reference of information
         required to be included in (y) and (z) above to be contained in
         periodic reports filed pursuant to Section 12 or 15(d) of the Exchange
         Act in the registration statement;

                  (iii) furnish to each seller of Registrable Securities covered
         by such registration statement and each Requesting Holder such number
         of conformed copies of such registration statement and of each such
         amendment and supplement thereto (in each case including all exhibits),
         such number of copies of the prospectus contained in such registration
         statement (including each preliminary prospectus and any summary
         prospectus) and any other prospectus filed under Rule 424 under the
         Securities Act, in conformity with the requirements of the Securities
         Act, and such other documents, as such seller may reasonably request;

                  (iv) use its reasonable best efforts to register or qualify
         all Registrable Securities and other securities covered by such
         registration statement under such other securities or blue sky laws of
         such jurisdictions where an exemption is not available and as such
         seller thereof and each Requesting Holder shall reasonably request, to
         keep such registration or qualification in effect for so long as such
         registration statement remains in effect, and take any other action
         which may be reasonably necessary or advisable to enable such seller to
         consummate the disposition in such jurisdictions of the securities
         owned by such seller.

                  (v) use its reasonable best efforts to cause all Registrable
         Securities covered by such registration statement to be registered with
         or approved by such other



                                      -8-
<PAGE>

         federal or state governmental agencies or authorities as may be
         necessary to enable the seller or sellers thereof to consummate the
         disposition of such Registrable Securities;

                  (vi) use its reasonable best efforts to furnish or cause to be
         furnished, on the date that such Registrable Securities are delivered
         to the underwriters for sale, if such securities are being sold through
         underwriters or, if such securities are not being sold through
         underwriters, on the date that the registration statement with respect
         to such securities becomes effective, (1) an opinion, dated as of such
         date, of the counsel representing the Company for the purposes of such
         registration, in form and substance as is customarily given to
         underwriters in an underwritten public offering and reasonably
         satisfactory to a majority in interest of the Holders participating in
         such registration, addressed to the underwriters, if any, and to the
         Holders participating in such registration and (2) a letter, dated as
         of such date, from the independent certified public accountants of the
         Company, in form and substance as is customarily given by independent
         certified public accountants to underwriters in an underwritten public
         offering and reasonably satisfactory to a majority in interest of the
         Holders participating in such registration, addressed to the
         underwriters, if any, and if permitted by applicable accounting
         standards, to the Holders participating in such registration.

                  (vii) notify each seller of Registrable Securities covered by
         such registration statement and each Requesting Holder, at any time
         when a prospectus relating thereto is required to be delivered under
         the Securities Act, upon discovery that, or upon the happening of any
         event as a result of which, the prospectus included in such
         registration statement, as then in effect, includes an untrue statement
         of a material fact or omits to state any material fact required to be
         stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
         misleading in the light of the circumstances under which they were
         made, and at the request of any such seller or holder promptly prepare
         and furnish to such seller or holder a reasonable number of copies of a
         supplement to or an amendment of such prospectus as may be necessary so
         that, as thereafter delivered to the purchasers of such securities,
         such prospectus shall not include an untrue statement of a material
         fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
         necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in the light of
         the circumstances under which they are made;

                  (viii) otherwise use its reasonable best efforts to comply
         with all applicable rules and regulations of the Commission, and make
         available to its security holders, as soon as reasonably practicable,
         an earnings statement covering the period of at least twelve (12)
         months, but not more than eighteen (18) months, beginning with the
         first full calendar month after the effective date of such registration
         statement, which earnings statement shall satisfy the provisions of
         Section 11(a) of the Securities Act, and will furnish to each such
         seller and each Requesting Holder at least two business days prior to
         the filing thereof a copy of any amendment or supplement to such
         registration statement or prospectus and shall not file any thereof to
         which any such seller or any Requesting Holder shall have reasonably
         objected on the grounds that such amendment or supplement does not
         comply in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities
         Act or of the rules or regulations thereunder;



                                      -9-
<PAGE>

                  (ix) provide and cause to be maintained a transfer agent and
         registrar for all Registrable Securities covered by such registration
         statement from and after a date not later than the effective date of
         such registration statement; and

                  (x) use its reasonable best efforts to list all Registrable
         Securities covered by such registration statement on any national
         securities exchange on which Registrable Securities of the type covered
         by such Registration Statement are then listed.

         Each Holder agrees by acquisition of such Registrable Securities that
upon receipt of any notice from the Company of the happening of any event of the
kind described in Section 2(d)(vii), such Holder will forthwith discontinue such
Holder's disposition of Registrable Securities pursuant to the registration
statement relating to such Registrable Securities until such Holder's receipt of
the copies of the supplemented or amended prospectus contemplated by Section
2(d)(vii).

         (e) Preparation; Reasonable Investigation. In connection with the
preparation and filing of each registration statement under the Securities Act
pursuant to this Agreement, the Company will give the Holders of Registrable
Securities registered under such registration statement, their underwriters, if
any, each Requesting Holder and their respective counsel and accountants the
opportunity to participate in the preparation of such registration statement,
each prospectus included therein or filed with the Commission, and each
amendment thereof or supplement thereto, and will give each of them such access
to its financial and other records and such opportunities to discuss the
business of the Company with its officers and the independent public accountants
who have certified its financial statements as shall be necessary, in the
opinion of such Holders' and such underwriters' respective counsel, to conduct a
reasonable investigation within the meaning of the Securities Act.

         (f) Indemnification.

                  (i) The Company will indemnify each of the Holders, as
         applicable, each of its officers, directors, employees, agents and
         attorneys, and each Person controlling each of the Holders, with
         respect to each registration which has been effected pursuant to this
         Section 2, and each underwriter, if any, and each person who controls
         any underwriter, against all claims, losses, damages and liabilities
         (or actions in respect thereof) arising out of or based on any untrue
         statement (or alleged untrue statement) of a material fact contained in
         any prospectus, offering circular or other document (including any
         related registration statement, notification or the like) incident to
         any such registration, qualification or compliance, or based on any
         omission (or alleged omission) to state therein a material fact
         required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
         therein not misleading, and will reimburse each of the Holders, each of
         its officers, directors, employees, agents and attorneys, and each
         Person controlling each of the Holders, each such underwriter and each
         Person who controls any such underwriter, for any legal and any other
         expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating and
         defending any such claim, loss, damage, liability or action, provided
         that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that
         any such claim, loss, damage, liability or expense arises out of or is
         based on any untrue statement or omission



                                      -10-
<PAGE>

         based upon written information furnished to the Company by the Holders
         or underwriter and stated to be specifically for use therein.

                  (ii) Each of the Holders will, indemnify the Company, each of
         its officers, directors, employees, agents and attorneys, and each
         underwriter, if any, of the Company's securities covered by
         registration statement in which such Holder's Registrable Securities
         are included, each person who controls the Company or such underwriter,
         each Other Stockholder and each of their officers, directors, and
         partners, and each person controlling such Other Stockholder against
         all claims, losses, damages and liabilities (or actions in respect
         thereof) arising out of or based on any untrue statement (or alleged
         untrue statement) of a material fact contained in any such registration
         statement, prospectus, offering circular or other document made by such
         Holder, or any omission (or alleged omission) to state therein a
         material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
         statements by such Holder therein not misleading, and will reimburse
         the Company and such Other Stockholders, officers, directors,
         employees, agents, attorneys underwriters or control persons for any
         legal or any other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with
         investigating or defending any such claim, loss, damage, liability or
         action, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such
         untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) or omission (or alleged
         omission) is made in such registration statement, prospectus, offering
         circular or other document in reliance upon and in conformity with
         written information furnished to the Company by such Holder and stated
         to be specifically for use therein; provided, however, that the
         obligations of each of the Holders hereunder shall be limited to an
         amount equal to the net proceeds to such Holder of securities sold as
         contemplated herein.

                  (iii) Promptly after receipt by an Indemnified Party under
         this Section 2(f) (an "Indemnified Party") of notice of the
         commencement of any action for which such Indemnified Party is entitled
         to indemnification under this Section 2(f), such Indemnified Party
         will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the
         indemnifying party under this Section 2(1) (the "Indemnifying Party"),
         notify the Indemnifying Party of the commencement thereof in writing;
         but the omission to so notify the Indemnifying Party will not relieve
         it from any liability under clauses (i) or (ii) above unless and to the
         extent such failure results in the forfeiture by the Indemnifying Party
         of substantial rights and defenses. In case any such action is brought
         against any Indemnified Party, and it notifies the Indemnifying Party
         of the commencement thereof, the Indemnifying Party will be entitled to
         participate therein and, to the extent that it may wish, jointly with
         any other Indemnifying Party similarly notified, to assume the defense
         thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified
         Party; provided, however, that if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the
         Indemnifying Party to represent the Indemnified Party would present
         such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the defendants in any
         such action include both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying
         Party and the Indemnified Party shall have been advised by counsel that
         there may be one or more legal defenses available to it and/or other
         Indemnified Parties that are different from or additional to those
         available to the Indemnifying Party, or (iii) the Indemnifying Party
         shall not have employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
         Indemnified Party to represent the Indemnified Party within a
         reasonable time after receipt by the Indemnifying Party of notice of
         the institution of such action, then, in each such case, the


                                      -11-
<PAGE>

         Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to direct the defense of
         such action on behalf of such Indemnified Party or parties and such
         Indemnified Party or parties shall have the right to select separate
         counsel to defend such action on behalf of such Indemnified Party or
         parties. After notice from the Indemnifying Party to such Indemnified
         Party of its election so to assume the defense thereof and approval by
         such Indemnified Party of counsel appointed to defend such action, the
         Indemnifying Party will not be liable to such Indemnified Party under
         this 2(f) for any legal or other expenses, other than reasonable costs
         of investigation, subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Party in
         connection with the defense thereof, unless (i) the Indemnified Party
         shall have employed separate counsel in accordance with the proviso to
         the immediately preceding sentence (it being understood, however, that
         in connection with such action the Indemnifying Party shall not be
         liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel (in addition
         to local counsel) in any one action or separate but substantially
         similar actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same
         general allegations or circumstances representing the Indemnified
         Parties who are parties to such action or actions) or (ii) the
         Indemnifying Party has authorized in writing the employment of counsel
         for the Indemnified Party at the expense of the Indemnifying Party.
         After such notice from the Indemnifying Party to such Indemnified
         Party, the Indemnifying Party will not be liable for the costs and
         expenses of any settlement of such action effected by such Indemnified
         Party without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party
         (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). Each
         Indemnified Party shall furnish such information regarding itself or
         the claim in question as an Indemnifying Party may reasonably request
         and as shall be reasonably required in connection with the defense of
         such claim and litigation resulting therefrom.

                  (iv) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 2(f)
         is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unavailable to an
         Indemnified Party with respect to any loss, liability, claim, damage or
         expense referred to herein, then the Indemnifying Party, in lieu of
         indemnifying such Indemnified Party hereunder, shall contribute to the
         amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Party as a result of such
         loss, liability, claim, damage or expense in such proportion as is
         appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Indemnifying Party on
         the one hand and of the Indemnified Party on the other in connection
         with the statements or omissions which resulted in such loss,
         liability, claim, damage or expense, as well as any other relevant
         equitable considerations. The relative fault of the Indemnifying Party
         and of the Indemnified Party shall be determined by reference to, among
         other things, whether the untrue (or alleged untrue) statement of a
         material fact or the omission (or alleged omission) to state a material
         fact relates to information supplied by the Indemnifying Party or by
         the Indemnified Party and the parties' relative intent, knowledge,
         access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such
         statement or omission.

                  (v) Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that the
         provisions on indemnification and contribution contained in the
         underwriting agreement entered into in connection with any underwritten
         public offering contemplated by this Agreement are in conflict with the
         foregoing provisions, the provisions in such underwriting agreement
         shall be controlling.



                                      -12-

         (g) Information by the Holders. A Holder holding Registrable Securities
included in any registration shall furnish to the Company such information
regarding such Holder and the distribution proposed by such Holder as the
Company may reasonably request in writing and as shall be reasonably required in
connection with any registration, qualification or compliance referred to in
this Section 2.

         (h) Rule 144 Reporting. With a view to making available to the Holder
the benefits of certain rules and regulations of the Commission which may permit
the sale of restricted securities to the public without registration, until the
earlier of (A) such date as all of the Registrable Securities, held by such
Holder have been sold in a registration pursuant to the Securities Act or
pursuant to Rule 144 (or any similar rule then in effect) or (B) such date as
all of the Registrable Securities held by such Holder are eligible to be sold
without restriction pursuant to Rule 144(k), the Company agrees to:

                  (i) make and keep public information available as those terms
         are understood and defined in Rule 144 at all times;

                  (ii) use its best efforts to file with the Commission in a
         timely manner all reports and other documents required of the Company
         under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act at any time after it has
         become subject to such reporting requirements; and

                  (iii) so long as the Holder owns any Registrable Securities,
         furnish to the Holder upon request, a written statement by the Company
         as to its compliance with the reporting requirements of Rule 144 (or
         any similar rule then in effect), and of the Securities Act and the
         Exchange Act, a copy of the most recent annual or quarterly report of
         the Company, and such other reports and documents so filed as the
         Holder may reasonably request in availing itself of any rule or
         regulation of the Commission allowing the Holder to sell any such
         securities without registration.

         (i) Termination. The registration rights set forth in this Section 2
shall not be available to any Holder if all of the Registrable Securities held
by such Holder have been sold in a registration pursuant to the Securities Act
or pursuant to Rule 144 (or any similar rule then in effect) or in the case of
the piggyback registration rights set forth in Section 2(b), if all of the
Registrable Securities held be such Holder are eligible to be sold pursuant to
Rule 144(k).

         SECTION 3. MISCELLANEOUS

         (a) Directly or Indirectly. Where any provision in this Agreement
refers to action to be taken by any Person, or which such Person is prohibited
from taking, such provision shall be applicable whether such action is taken
directly or indirectly by such Person.

         (b) Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the internal and substantive laws of Delaware and without regard
to any Conflicts of Laws concepts which would apply the substantive law of some
other jurisdiction.

         (c) Section Headings. The headings of the sections and subsections of
this Agreement are inserted for convenience only and shall not be deemed to
constitute a part thereof.

whether or not such reproduction was made by the Holders in the regular course
of business) and that any enlargement, facsimile or further reproduction of such
reproduction shall likewise be admissible in evidence.

         (f) Successors and assigns. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit
of and be binding upon the successors and assigns of each of the parties.

         (g) Entire Agreement. This Agreement represents the entire agreement
and understanding of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and
no representations or warranties have been made in connection with this
Agreement other than those expressly set forth herein or in certificates and
other documents delivered in accordance herewith. This Agreement supersedes all
prior negotiations, discussions, correspondence, communications, understanding
and agreements between the parties relating to the subject matter of this
Agreement and all prior drafts of this Agreement, all of which are merged into
this Agreement. No prior drafts of this Agreement and no words or phrases from
any such prior drafts shall be admissible into evidence in any action or suit
involving this Agreement.

         (h) Waivers and Amendments. This Agreement may be amended, and the
observance of any term of this Agreement may be waived, only with the written
consent of the Company and the Holders holding a majority of the then
outstanding Registrable Securities (calculated on an as-converted basis).

         (i) Severability. This Agreement shall be deemed severable, and the
invalidity or unenforceability of any term or provision hereof shall not affect
the validity or enforceability of this Agreement or of any other term or
provision hereof. Furthermore, in lieu of any such invalid or unenforceable term
or provision, the parties hereto intend that there shall be added as a part of
this Agreement a provision as similar in terms to such invalid or unenforceable
provision as may be possible and be valid and enforceable.

         (j) Counterparts. Facsimile transmission of any signed original
document and/or retransmission of any signed facsimile transmission shall be the
same as delivery of any original. At the request of the Company or the Holder,
the parties will confirm facsimile transmission by signing a duplicate original
document. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of
which shall be deemed an original and all of which together shall be considered
one and the same agreement.

rights agreement which are in conflict with this Agreement.

Securities are held by a nominee for the beneficial owner thereof, the

Registrable Securities for purposes of any request or other action by any holder
or holders of Registrable Securities pursuant to this Agreement or any
determination of any number or percentage of shares of Registrable Securities
held by any holder or holders of Registrable Securities contemplated by this
Agreement. If the beneficial owner of any Registrable Securities so elects, the
Company may require assurances reasonably satisfactory to it of such owner's
beneficial ownership of such Registrable Securities.

under or in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, each of the Company and the Holder hereby submit to the exclusive

irrevocably waive, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection that
they may now have or hereafter obtain to the laying of venue in any such court
