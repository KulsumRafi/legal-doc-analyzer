<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Plan shall be administered by the Board of Directors and/or by a Committee of the Board of Directors of SLM Corporation, as appointed from time to time by the Board of Directors. The
Board of Directors shall fill vacancies on and from time to time may remove or add members to the Committee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless otherwise restricted by the Board of Directors, the
Committee may appoint one or more separate committees (any such committee, a "Subcommittee") composed of one or more directors of SLM Corporation (who may, but need not, be members of the Committee)
and may delegate to any such Subcommittee(s) the authority to grant Awards under the Plan to Eligible Employees, to determine all terms of such Awards, and/or to administer the Plan or any aspect of
it. Any action by any such Subcommittee within the scope of such delegation shall be deemed for all purposes to have been taken by the Committee. The Subcommittee's authority to grant Awards is
limited in the same manner as provided for in the administration of the Corporation's Management Incentive Plan. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject
to the express provisions of this Plan, the Committee shall be authorized and empowered to do all things necessary or desirable in connection with the administration of this
Plan, including, without limitation: (a)&nbsp;to prescribe, amend and rescind rules and regulations relating to this Plan and to define terms not otherwise defined herein; (b)&nbsp;to determine
which persons are Eligible Employees (as defined in Section&nbsp;5 hereof), to which of such Eligible Employees, if any, an Award shall be granted hereunder; (c)&nbsp;to determine the number of
shares of Common Stock subject to an Award and the exercise or purchase price of shares subject to a Stock Option; (d)&nbsp;to establish and verify the extent of satisfaction of any conditions to
exercisability or vesting of an Award, (e)&nbsp;to waive conditions to and/or accelerate exercisability or vesting of an Award, either automatically upon the occurrence of specified events
(including in connection with a change of control of SLM Corporation) or otherwise in its discretion; (f)&nbsp;to prescribe and amend the terms of an Award made under this Plan (which need not be
identical); (g)&nbsp;to determine whether, and the extent to which, adjustments are required pursuant to Section&nbsp;8 hereof; (h)&nbsp;to interpret and construe this Plan, any rules and
regulations under the Plan and the terms and conditions of any Award granted hereunder, and to make exceptions to any such provisions in good faith and for the benefit of the Corporation; and
(i)&nbsp;to make all other determinations deemed necessary or advisable for the administration of the Plan. The Committee shall act pursuant to a majority vote or unanimous written consent. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All
decisions, determinations and interpretations by the Committee regarding the Plan, any rules and regulations under the Plan and the terms and conditions of any Award granted
hereunder, shall be final and binding on all Eligible Employees and recipients of Awards. The Committee shall consider such factors as it deems relevant, in its sole and absolute discretion, to making
such decisions, determinations and interpretations including, without limitation, the recommendations or advice of any officer or other employee of the Corporation and such attorneys, consultants and
accountants as it may select. </FONT></P>

(d)&nbsp;such terms and conditions of exercise as may be determined from time to time by the Committee, (e)&nbsp;restrictions on the transfer of the Option and forfeiture provisions, and
(f)&nbsp;such further terms and conditions, in each case not inconsistent with the Plan as may be determined from time to time by the Committee. Options granted pursuant to the Plan need not be
identical but each Option shall be subject to the following terms and conditions: </FONT></P>

this Plan to grant an Option or provide for the grant of an Option, either automatically or in the discretion of the Committee, upon the occurrence of specified events, including, without limitation,
the achievement of performance goals or the satisfaction of an event or condition within the control of the recipient of the Option or within the control of others. </FONT></P>

Committee. The exercise price shall not be less than the fair market value of the Common Stock on the date of grant of the Option, except that the Committee may specifically provide that the exercise
price of an Option may be higher or lower in the case of an Option granted to employees of a company acquired by the Corporation in assumption and substitution of Options held by such employees at the
time such company is acquired. Unless the Committee shall specify otherwise, for purposes of this Plan the term "fair market value" shall mean, as of any date, the closing price for a Share reported
for that date on the consolidated tape for securities listed on the New York Stock Exchange or, if no Shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange on the date in question, then for the next preceding
date for which Shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange. The exercise price shall be paid in such form of consideration as the Committee in its discretion shall specify, which may but need not
include, e.g., in cash, by payment under an arrangement with a broker where payment is made pursuant to an irrevocable direction to the broker to deliver all or part of the proceeds from the sale of
the Option shares to the Corporation, by the surrender of shares of Common Stock owned for at least six months by the Option holder exercising the Option and having a fair market value on the day
preceding the date of exercise equal to the Option price, or by any combination of the foregoing. </FONT></P>

exercisable in such manner and at such times as the Committee shall determine. The Committee may specify that Options granted under this Plan shall become exercisable at such time and in such
installments during the period prior to the expiration of the Option's term as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion. The Committee shall have the right to make the timing of exercise of
any Option granted under the Plan subject to such performance requirements as deemed appropriate by the Committee. At any time after the grant of an Option the Committee may, in its sole discretion,
reduce or eliminate any restrictions surrounding the Participant's right to exercise all or part of the Option. Each Option granted must expire within a period of not more than ten (10)&nbsp;years
from the grant date. </FONT></P>
