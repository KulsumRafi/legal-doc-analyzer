<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Dear Tony,</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">The past year at ZIM has been an exciting one and the future looks even more
so. As you are aware, we have, and continue, to position ourselves to take
advantage of one of the fastest growing sectors in the industry, text
messaging.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">It has been communicated to staff on many occasions that ZIM is filing with
the SEC for public standing. This means that, beyond product creation and
business development, we have the additional responsibility to the
shareholders to be profitable. In order to position us for success and a
strong share price, a strategic plan has been put in place to lower expenses
and to focus on increasing revenue as we move into our new fiscal year.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">In order to achieve this goal, salaries have been reviewed for the entire
organization and reductions have been implemented. Specifically, your annual
salary as of June&nbsp;1, 2002 will be $100,000.00. In lieu of this portion of your
salary, additional options will be granted at a rate of 2.5 times the
difference of your current and new annual salary, at a price of $1.10 per
share, pending Board approval.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">It is anticipated that with a strong strategic plan to increase revenues and
decrease expenses, ZIM will be in a position to re-evaluate annual salaries
once our goal of profitability has been reached.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Your cooperation in this initiative, and continued support of our corporate
goals is truly appreciated and there is confidence that the support of
everyone will ensure a strong success for ZIM.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Sincerely,</FONT>
