Agent may exercise from time to time any and all rights and remedies available
to it under applicable law, in addition to those described in this Section
below. Each Debtor agrees, in case of Default, (i)&nbsp;to assemble, at its
expense, all its Inventory, Equipment and other Goods (other than Fixtures) at
a convenient place or places acceptable to the Administrative Agent, and (ii)
at the Administrative Agent&#146;s request, to execute all such documents and do all
such other things which may be reasonably necessary or desirable in order to
enable the Administrative Agent or its nominee to be registered as owner of the
Intellectual Property with any competent registration authority and to
otherwise enforce its rights with respect to any Collateral. Any notification
of intended disposition of any of the Collateral required by law shall be
deemed reasonably and properly given if given at least five days before such
disposition. Any and all proceeds of any disposition by the Administrative
Agent of any of the Collateral may be applied by the Administrative Agent to
payment of expenses in connection with the Collateral, including reasonable
attorneys&#146; fees and legal expenses, and any balance of such proceeds may be
applied by the Administrative Agent toward the payment of such of the
Liabilities, and in such order of application, as the Administrative Agent may
from time to time elect.

reasonable disposition of any Collateral, including, without limitation,
Inventory, Equipment, Computer Hardware and Software or Intellectual Property
may be by lease or license of, in addition to the sale of, such Collateral.
Each Debtor further agrees and acknowledges that a disposition (i)&nbsp;made in the
usual manner on any recognized market, (ii)&nbsp;at the price current in any
recognized market at the time of disposition and (iii)&nbsp;in conformity with
reasonable commercial practices among dealers in the type of property subject
to the disposition shall be deemed commercially reasonable.

attorney-in-fact, with full power and authority in the place of such Debtor and
in the name of such Debtor, in Administrative Agent&#146;s discretion, to take any
action and to execute any instrument that it may deem necessary to accomplish
the purposes of this Agreement.

reasonable care in the custody and preservation of any of the Collateral in its
possession if it takes such action for that purpose as any applicable Debtor
requests in writing, but failure of the Administrative Agent to comply with any
such request shall not of itself be deemed a failure to exercise reasonable
care, and no failure of the Administrative Agent to preserve or protect any
rights with respect to such Collateral against prior parties, or to do any act
with respect to the preservation of such Collateral not so requested by any
Debtor, shall be deemed of itself a failure to exercise reasonable care in the
custody or preservation of such Collateral.
