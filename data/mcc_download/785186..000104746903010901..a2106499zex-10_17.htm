will, on the date the applicable Revolving Credit Loan would have been made, purchase an undivided participating interest in the Swingline Loan to be refunded in an amount equal to its Revolving
Credit Commitment Percentage of the aggregate amount of such Swingline Loan. Each Lender will immediately transfer to the Swingline Lender, in immediately available funds, the amount of its
participation and upon receipt thereof the Swingline Lender will deliver to such Lender a certificate evidencing such participation dated the date of receipt of such funds and for such amount.
Whenever, at any time after the Swingline Lender has received from any Lender such Lender's participating interest in a Swingline Loan, the Swingline Lender receives any payment on account thereof,
the Swingline Lender will distribute to such Lender its participating
interest in such amount (appropriately adjusted, in the case of interest payments, to reflect the period of time during which such Lender's participating interest was outstanding and funded). </FONT></P>

Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to a proposed borrowing date that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's ratable portion of

to the Administrative Agent on the proposed borrowing date in accordance with Sections 2.3(b) and 4.2, and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the
Borrowers on such date a corresponding amount. If such amount is made available to the Administrative Agent on a date after such borrowing date, such Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent on
demand an amount, until paid, equal to the product of (a) the amount not made available by such Lender in accordance with the terms hereof, <U>times</U> (b) the daily average

absent manifest error. If such Lender's Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage, Term A Loan Percentage or Term B Loan Percentage, as applicable, of such borrowing is not made available to the
Administrative Agent by such Lender within three (3) Business Days after such borrowing date, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover such amount made available by the Administrative
Agent with interest thereon at the rate per annum applicable to Base Rate Loans hereunder, on demand, from the Borrowers. The failure of any Lender to make its Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage,
Term A Loan Percentage or Term B Loan Percentage, as applicable, of any Loan available shall not relieve it or any other Lender of its obligation, if any, hereunder to make its Revolving Credit

conducts an ongoing review of the effect of Environmental Laws on the business, operations and properties of such Borrower and its Subsidiaries, in the course of which it identifies and evaluates
associated liabilities and costs (including, without limitation, any capital or operating expenditures required for clean-up or closure of properties presently or previously owned, any capital or
operating expenditures required to achieve or maintain compliance with environmental protection standards imposed by law or as a condition of any license, permit or contract, any related constraints
on operating activities, including any periodic or permanent shutdown of any facility or reduction in the level of or change in the nature of operations conducted at any such facility, any costs or
liabilities in connection with off-site disposal of wastes or Hazardous Substances, and any actual or potential liabilities to third parties, including employees, and any related costs and expenses).
On the basis of this review, each Borrower has concluded that such associated liabilities and costs, including the costs of compliance with Environmental Laws, could not reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect. </FONT></P>
