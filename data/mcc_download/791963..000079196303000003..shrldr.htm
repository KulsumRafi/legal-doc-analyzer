<p align="center"><b><br>
RIGHT OF CO-SALE</b></p>

<p><b>Co-Sale Right</b>. At any time that any member of
Significant Shareholder I Group (the &quot;<b>Selling Holder</b>&quot;)
desires to Transfer any Class B Shares Beneficially Owned by it
to other than a Permitted Transferee, the Selling Holder shall
first deliver written notice of its desire to do so (the &quot;<b>Co-Sale
Notice</b>&quot;) to each member of Significant Shareholder II
Group (the &quot;<b>Co-Sale Shareholders</b>&quot;). The Co-Sale
Notice shall specify: (i) the name and address of the Person or
Persons to which the Selling Holder proposes to Transfer the
Class B Shares (the &quot;<b>Offeror</b>&quot;), (ii) the number
of Class B Shares the Selling Holder proposes to Transfer (the
&quot;<b>Co-Sale Offered Shares</b>&quot;), (iii) the total
consideration to be delivered to the Selling Holder for the
proposed Transfer and the consideration for each Class B Share
the Selling Holder proposes to Transfer, and (iv) all other
material terms and conditions of the proposed transaction.</p>

<p><b>Election to Participate</b>. Each member of the Significant
Shareholder II Group may within the 30 day period after delivery
of the Co-Sale Notice (the &quot;<b>Co-Sale Option Period</b>&quot;)
notify the Selling Holder of such member's desire to participate
in the sale of the Co-Sale Offered Shares and to sell, at the
price per Class B Share and on the terms set forth in the Co-Sale
Notice, a number of Class B Shares Beneficially Owned by such
member up to such member's Pro Rata Amount. Each member of the
Significant Shareholder II Group which has so notified the
Selling Holder within the Co-Sale Option Period of its desire to
sell Class B Shares in the transaction (a &quot;<b>Participating
Shareholder</b>&quot;) shall be entitled to do so, subject to
cut-back as set forth in Section 3.3.</p>

<p><b>Procedure</b>. The Selling Holder shall use its best
efforts to interest the Offeror in purchasing, in addition to the
Co-Sale Offered Shares, the Class B Shares which the
Participating Shareholders wish to sell. If the Offeror does not
wish to purchase all of the Class B Shares made available by the
Selling Holder and the Participating Shareholders (the Selling
Holder and the Participating Shareholders being hereinafter
referred to collectively as &quot;<b>Co-Sale Right Holders</b>&quot;),
then each Co-Sale Right Holder shall be entitled to sell a
portion of the Class B Shares being sold to the Offeror obtained
by multiplying the number of Class B Shares that the Offeror is
willing to purchase by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
number of Class B Shares such Co-Sale Right Holder has proposed
to sell to the Offeror, and the denominator of which is the
number of Class B Shares that all of the Co-Sale Right Holders
have proposed to sell to the Offeror. The transaction
contemplated by the Co-Sale Notice shall be consummated not later
than 90 days after the expiration of the Co-Sale Option Period.</p>

<p><b>Sale of Co-Sale Offered Shares After the Expiration of the
Co-Sale Right</b>. If the members of Significant Shareholder II
Group irrevocably waive their Right of Co-Sale pursuant to this
Article III with respect to a specific Transfer, or otherwise do
not indicate their wish to participate in such Transfer during
the Co-Sale Option Period, then the Selling Holder shall have the
right, but not the obligation, to secure a bona fide sale of all,
but not less than all, of the Co-Sale Offered Shares to a third
party and Transfer such Co-Sale Offered Shares to such third
party at a price equal to the price and on terms and conditions
no less favorable to the Selling Holder than the terms and
conditions described in the Co-Sale Option Period; <u>provided</u>
that such Transfer to the bona fide third party is consummated
within 90 days following the Co-Sale Option Period upon the same
terms and conditions as are set forth in the Co-Sale Notice (it
being agreed that if such Transfer is not consummated within such
90-day period, the Selling Holder must re-commence the applicable
procedures provided in this Agreement if it wishes to Transfer
any Class B Shares).</p>

<p align="center"><b><br>
DRAG ALONG RIGHT</b></p>

<p><b>Drag Along Right</b>. In the event that the Significant
Shareholder I Group proposes to Transfer (other than a pledge of
Class B Shares in connection with a financing) all the Class B
Shares Beneficially Owned by it on the date of such Transfer to a
Person other than a Permitted Transferee, whether by way of a
merger, consolidation, sale or exchange of securities or
otherwise and the proposed Transfer is at arms length and its
terms are commercially reasonable, the Significant Shareholder I
Group shall have the right (the &quot;<b>Drag Along Right</b>&quot;)
to require the members of the Significant Shareholder II Group to
Transfer all Class B Shares Beneficially Owned by them to such
proposed transferee upon the same terms and conditions offered to
the Significant Shareholder I Group (the &quot;<b>Drag Along Sale</b>&quot;).</p>

<p><b>Drag Along Notice</b>. Before the Significant Shareholder I
Group may exercise its Drag Along Right hereunder, the
Significant Shareholder I Group must give to the members of the
Significant Shareholder II Group, a written notice (the &quot;<b>Drag
Along Notice</b>&quot;) stating (i) the Significant Shareholder I
Group's bona fide intention to Transfer all of its Class B Shares
and the name and address of the proposed transferee; and (ii) the
bona fide cash price or, in reasonable detail, other
consideration, per share for which the Significant Shareholder I
Group proposes to Transfer such Class B Shares.</p>

<p><b>Procedures</b>. The Significant Shareholder II Group shall
take all actions reasonably requested by the Significant
Shareholder I Group in connection with the consummation of such
sale, and within 15 Business Days of the receipt of such Drag
Along Notice (or such longer period of time as the Significant
Shareholder I Group shall designate in such notice), shall cause
all of its Class B Shares to be sold to the designated purchaser
on the same terms and conditions and for the same type and amount
of consideration as the Class B Shares being sold by the
Significant Shareholder I Group. In furtherance of the foregoing,
in connection with a Drag Along Sale, the Significant Shareholder
II Group shall (i) raise no objections against the Drag Along
Sale or the process pursuant to which it was arranged, except
where such Significant Shareholder II Group has a reasonable
suspicion of fraud, dishonesty or misconduct in connection
therewith and (ii) execute all documents containing such terms
and conditions as those executed by Significant Shareholder I
Group as reasonably directed by the Significant Shareholder I
Group, to the extent permitted by law.</p>

<p><b>Closing of the Drag Along Sale</b>. The closing of the Drag
Along Sale shall be held at such time and place as the
Significant Shareholder I Group shall specify and at least five
days' notice of the time and place of the closing shall be given
to the Significant Shareholder II Group. At such closing, the
Significant Shareholder II Group shall deliver certificates
representing the Class B Shares to be Transferred and such Class
B Shares shall be free and clear of any liens, claims or
encumbrances (other than restrictions imposed pursuant to
applicable federal and state securities laws or by the buyer
thereof) and the Significant Shareholder II Group shall so
represent and warrant.</p>

<p><b>Other Rights</b>. If a Significant Shareholder I Group
exercises its Drag Along Right, the Significant Shareholder II
Group required to participate in such Transfer shall have no
rights under Articles IV or VI of this Agreement with respect to
such Transfer.</p>

<p align="center"><b><br>
PUT RIGHT</b></p>

<p><b>Put Right</b>. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof
for so long as the Significant Shareholder II Group holds any
Class B Shares, it shall be entitled, in its sole discretion, by
giving written notice (the &quot;<b>Put Notice</b>&quot;) to the
Significant Shareholder I Group, to require the Significant
Shareholder I Group to purchase at the Put Purchase Price (the
&quot;<b>Put Right</b>&quot;), any of the Class B Shares
Beneficially Owned by it. The Put Notice shall specify such
amount of Class B Shares to be sold, shall contain a commitment
to sell such Class B Shares in the manner set forth in this
Section 5.1 and shall specify the date (the &quot;<b>Put Closing
Date</b>&quot;) such Class B Shares are to be sold (which date
shall be 13 Business Days after the Put Notice is delivered or,
if such date is not a Business Day, the following Business Day).
Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the
Significant Shareholder II Group shall have the right to withdraw
any Put Notice and to cancel the sale of the Class B Shares
pursuant thereto by delivering a written notice of its desire to
do so to the Significant Shareholder I Group no later than 2
Business Days prior to the Put Closing Date. </p>

<p><b>Put Purchase Price</b>. The purchase price for any Class B
Share being purchased pursuant to a Put Right (the &quot;<b>Put
Purchase Price</b>&quot;) shall be equal to the Market Value
multiplied by the number of Class B Shares being sold pursuant to
such Put Right.</p>

<p><b>Put Right Closing</b>. The consummation of the transactions
pursuant to an exercised Put Right shall take place on the Put
Closing Date in accordance with this Section 5.3. On the Put
Closing Date, the Significant Shareholder I Group shall pay the
Put Purchase Price to the Significant Shareholder II Group by
cashier's check or wire transfer of immediately available funds
to an account or accounts designated by the Significant
Shareholder II Group in exchange for the Class B Shares being
purchased. The consideration for the Class B Shares sold pursuant
to the Put Right shall be divided <i>pro rata</i> between the
members of the Significant Shareholder II Group based on the
relative amounts of Class B Shares sold by each such member or as
such members may otherwise agree. The purchase of the Class B
Shares pursuant to the Put Right and the payment of the Put
Purchase Price shall be made <i>pro rata</i> by the members of
the Significant Shareholder I Group based on the relative amounts
of Class B Shares Beneficially Owned by each such member of the
Significant Shareholder I Group or as such members may otherwise
agree. The Significant Shareholder II Group shall cause the Class
B Shares being purchased to be delivered to the Significant
Shareholder I Group at the closing free and clear of all liens,
charges or encumbrances of any kind. The Significant Shareholder
II Group shall take all such actions as the Significant
Shareholder I Group reasonably requests to vest in the
Significant Shareholder I Group title to the Put Securities being
purchased free of any lien, charge or encumbrance incurred by or
through the Significant Shareholder II Group.</p>

<p><a name="_Toc26706850"><b>Trading Restrictions</b></a><b>. </b>Each
of the Shareholders agrees that he, she or it shall refrain from,
during the period between the date on which the Put Notice is
delivered and three Business Days prior to the Put Closing Date,
(a) trading Class A Shares or (b) taking any action with the
intent of, directly or indirectly, manipulating or otherwise
influencing the market value of the Class A Shares. </p>
