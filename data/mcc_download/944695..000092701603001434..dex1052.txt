Dear Mike:

On October 22, 2002 you were elected Chairman of the Board of Directors. In

same date. As Chairman of the Board of Directors and as Chairman of the Office
of the Chairman, you have assumed new duties. As Chairman of the Board of
Directors, you will coordinate the activities of the Board and you will provide
an interface between the Board and the Company. As Chairman of the Office of the
Chairman, you will coordinate the actions of Messrs. Huber, Parry and Restrepo
and provide guidance and direction to Messrs. Huber, Parry and/or Restrepo as
needed.

In light of your new duties, Allmerica Financial Corporation will, for the six

pay you the sum of $100,000.00 ("Your Consideration"). Your Consideration is
subject to the approval of the Allmerica Financial Corporation Board of
Directors and for the Initial Term will be in lieu of Board meeting fees. You

Consideration in a lump sum on January 2, 2003.

During the Initial Term, the Company will also provide you with a suitable
