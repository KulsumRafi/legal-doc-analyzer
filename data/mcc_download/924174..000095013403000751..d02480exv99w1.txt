         Each Noteholder, severally and not jointly, makes, with respect to
itself, the following representations and warranties to the Company, each and
all of which shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
Closing hereunder:

         3.1 Investment Intention. Such Noteholder is acquiring the December
2002 Preferred Stock for its own account, for investment purposes and not with a
view to the distribution thereof. Such Noteholder will not, directly or
indirectly, offer, transfer, sell, assign, pledge, hypothecate, or otherwise
dispose of any of the December 2002 Preferred Stock (or solicit any offers to
buy, purchase, or otherwise acquire any of the December 2002 Preferred Stock),
except in compliance with the Securities Act.

         3.2 Accredited Investor. Such Noteholder is an "accredited investor"
(as that term is defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D under the Securities Act)
and by reason of its business and financial experience, it has such knowledge,
sophistication and experience in business and financial matters as to be capable
of evaluating the merits and risks of the prospective investment, is able to
bear the economic risk of such investment and is able to afford a complete loss
of such investment. Such Noteholder's investment in the Company is reasonable in
relation to such Noteholder's net worth and financial needs, and such Noteholder
is able to bear the economic risk of losing its entire investment in the
December 2002 Preferred Stock. Such Noteholder has adequate means of providing
for such Noteholder's current needs and contingencies, has no need for liquidity
in the investment contemplated hereby, and is able to bear the risk of loss of
such Noteholder's entire investment.

         3.3 Corporate Existence. Such Noteholder is duly organized, validly
existing, and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
organization.

         3.4 Power; Authorization; Enforceable Obligations. The execution,
delivery, and performance by such Noteholder of this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents to be executed by it: (i) are within such Noteholder's
corporate or partnership power, as the case may be; (ii) have been duly
authorized by all necessary corporate or partnership action, as the case may be;
(iii) are not in contravention of any provision of such Noteholders' certificate
of



                                       13
<PAGE>

incorporation, by-laws, partnership agreement or other similar organizational
document; and (iv) will not violate any law or regulation, or any order or
decree of any court or governmental instrumentality binding on such Noteholder.
This Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which such Noteholder is a
party have each been duly executed and delivered by such Noteholder and
constitute the legal, valid, and binding obligations of such Noteholder,
enforceable against it in accordance with their respective terms, subject to
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization,
moratorium, and similar laws affecting creditors' rights and remedies generally,
and subject, as to enforceability, to general principles of equity, including
principles of commercial reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing (regardless
of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding at law or in equity).

         3.5 Ownership of Exchange Notes. Such Noteholder is the beneficial
owner of, and has good and marketable title to, the Exchange Notes it will
exchange pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and on the Closing Date will
deliver for exchange its interests in such Exchange Notes free and clear of all
Liens, options, purchase rights, contracts, equities claims, and demands. Such
Noteholder is not a party to any option, warrant, purchase right, or other
contract or commitment that could require such Noteholder to sell, transfer or
dispose of any of such Exchange Notes.

         3.6 Information. Such Noteholder is in a position regarding the
Company, which, based upon its relationship or economic bargaining power,
enabled and enables such Noteholder to obtain information from the Company in
order to evaluate the merits and risks of such Noteholder's investment in the
December 2002 Preferred Stock. The Company has made available to such
Noteholder, at a reasonable time prior to its exchange for the December 2002
Preferred Stock, the opportunity to ask questions of, and receive answers from,
the Company concerning the terms and conditions of the offering and to obtain
any additional information relating to the Company, to the extent that the
Company possesses such information or can acquire it without unreasonable effort
or expense, which is necessary to verify the accuracy of the information given
to it or otherwise to make an informed investment decision. No statement,
printed material or inducement was given or made by the Company or anyone on its
behalf which is contrary to the written information disclosed to such
Noteholder.

         3.7 No General Solicitation. Such Noteholder has not been offered the

                    COMPANY'S REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

         The Company makes the following representations and warranties to each
Noteholder as of the date hereof, each and all of which shall survive the
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Closing hereunder:

         4.1 Authorized and Outstanding Stock. After giving effect to the
Closing, the authorized Stock of the Company consists of (a) 1,000,000 shares of
Common Stock, of which 1,000 shares are issued and outstanding, and (b) 10,000
shares of preferred stock, $0.001 par value per share, of the Company, of which
(i) 2,500 shares are designated as the Series A Preferred Stock, of which
1,451.5909 shares are issued and outstanding, and (ii) 2,500 shares are
designated as the Series B Preferred Stock, of which 1,218.28079 shares will be
issued and outstanding after giving effect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. All of such issued and outstanding shares, including, without
limitation, the December 2002 Preferred Stock, are validly issued, fully paid
and non-assessable. Schedule 4.1 hereto contains a complete and correct list of
all stockholders of the Company and the number of shares owned by each. Except
as set forth on Schedule 4.1, (i) there is no existing option, warrant, call,
commitment or other agreement to which the Company is a party requiring, and
there are no convertible securities of the Company outstanding which upon
conversion would require or permit, the issuance of any additional shares of
Stock of the Company or other securities convertible into shares of equity
securities of the Company, other than, under certain circumstances, the issuance
in lieu of cash dividends of (a) Common Stock or Series A Preferred Stock on the
Series A Preferred Stock, and (b) Common Stock or Series B Preferred Stock on
the Series B Preferred Stock, and (ii) there are no agreements to which the
Company is a party or, to the knowledge of the Company, to which any stockholder
or warrant holder of the Company is a party, with respect to the voting or
transfer of the Stock of the Company or with respect to any other aspect of the
Company's affairs, other than the Stockholder Agreement. There are no
stockholders' preemptive rights or rights of first refusal or other similar
rights with respect to the issuance of Stock by the Company, other than pursuant
to the Transaction Documents.

         4.2 Authorization and Issuance of the December 2002 Preferred Stock.
The issuance of the December 2002 Preferred Stock has been duly authorized by
all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company and, upon delivery to
Noteholders of certificates therefor in exchange for the Exchange Notes in
accordance with the terms hereof, the December 2002 Preferred Stock will have
been validly issued and fully paid and non-assessable, free and clear of all
pledges, liens, encumbrances, and preemptive rights, except as provided in the
Stockholder Agreement.

         4.3 Securities Laws. In reliance on the investment representations
contained in Article 3, the offer, issuance, exchange for, and delivery of the
December 2002 Preferred Stock, as provided in this Agreement, are exempt from
the registration requirements of the Securities



                                       15
<PAGE>

Act and all applicable state securities laws, and are otherwise in compliance
with such laws. Neither the Company nor any Person acting on its behalf has
taken or will take any action (including, without limitation, any offering of
any securities of the Company under circumstances which would require the
integration of such offering with the offering of the December 2002 Preferred
Stock under the Securities Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC
thereunder) which might subject the offering, issuance or exchange for the
December 2002 Preferred Stock to the registration requirements of Section 5 of
the Securities Act.

         4.4 Corporate Existence; Compliance with Law. The Company and each of
its Subsidiaries, if any, (i) is a corporation, limited liability company,
limited partnership, or unincorporated joint venture duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the state of its organization,
(ii) has all requisite power and authority to conduct its business as now
conducted and as presently contemplated and to execute and deliver each
Transaction Document to which it is a party and consummate the transactions
contemplated thereby, and (iii) is duly qualified to do business and is in good
standing in each jurisdiction in which the character of the properties owned or
leased by it or in which the transaction of its business makes such
qualification necessary except where the failure to be qualified or in good
standing is not reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         4.5 Subsidiaries. Schedule 4.5 is a complete and correct description of
the name, jurisdiction of incorporation and ownership of the outstanding Stock
of all Subsidiaries of the Company in existence on the date hereof. All of the
issued and outstanding shares of Stock of such Subsidiaries have been validly
issued and are fully paid and non-assessable, and the holders thereof are not
entitled to any preemptive, first refusal, or other similar rights. Except as
indicated on such Schedule, all such Stock is owned by the Company directly or
indirectly through one or more of its wholly-owned Subsidiaries, free and clear
of all Liens (other than Permitted Liens), and there are no options, warrants,
rights to purchase, or similar rights covering Stock for any such Subsidiary.

         4.6 Corporate Power; Authorization; Enforceable Obligations. The
execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this Agreement, the other
Transaction Documents to which it is a party and all instruments and documents
to be delivered by the Company, the issuance and exchange for the December 2002
Preferred Stock and the consummation of the other transactions contemplated by
any of the foregoing: (i) have been duly authorized by all necessary action,
(ii) except for such conflicts for which consents have been obtained, do not and

operating agreement or its certificate of partnership or partnership agreement,
as applicable, or any applicable law or any material contractual restriction
binding on or otherwise affecting its operations or any of its properties, (iii)
do not and will not result in or require the creation of any Lien (other than
pursuant to any Transaction Document) upon, or with respect to, any of its
properties, and (iv) except as set forth in Schedule 4.6, do not and will not
result in any suspension, revocation, impairment, forfeiture or non-renewal of
any permit, license, authorization or approval applicable to its operations or
any of its properties, except where such contravention, creation, suspension,
revocation, impairment, forfeiture, or non-renewal is not reasonably likely to
have a Material Adverse Effect. This Agreement and each of the other Transaction
Documents being delivered on the date hereof have been duly executed and
delivered by the Company and Subsidiaries named therein and will be the legal,
valid and binding obligation of the Company



                                       16

and each Subsidiary that is a party thereto, enforceable against such party in

material respects the consolidated financial condition and results of operations

periods indicated, and such audited balance sheets and the notes thereto
disclose all material liabilities, direct or contingent, of Holdings and its
consolidated Subsidiaries, as of the dates thereof.

Company and its Subsidiaries has good and marketable title to, or valid
leasehold interests in, all property and assets material to its business, free
and clear of all Liens except Permitted Liens. The properties are in good
working order and condition, ordinary wear and tear excepted. Schedule 4.8 sets
forth a complete and accurate list of all real property owned or leased by each
of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and (ii) each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries has complied with all obligations under all leases to which it is a
party and under which it is in occupancy, and all such leases are in full force
and effect, except for any instances of noncompliance and such failures of such
leases to be in full force and effect that, individually or in the aggregate,
could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect and each
of the Company and its Subsidiaries enjoys peaceful and undisturbed possession
under all such material leases.

         4.9 Adverse Agreements, Etc. Except (A) the Chapter 11 Cases and (B) as
set forth on Schedule 4.14, none of the Company nor its Subsidiaries is subject

Effect, (i) the operations of each of the Company and its Subsidiaries are in
compliance in all material respects with Environmental Laws; (ii) there has been
no Release at any of the properties owned or operated by any of the Company and
its Subsidiaries or a predecessor in interest, or at any disposal or treatment

Adverse Effect; (iii) no Environmental Action has been asserted against any of
the Company and its Subsidiaries or any predecessor in interest nor does any of

                                       17
<PAGE>

Adverse Effect; and (iv) no Environmental Actions have been asserted against any
facilities that may have received Hazardous Materials generated by any of the
Company and its Subsidiaries or any predecessor in interest which could have a
Material Adverse Effect.

         4.11 Labor Matters. There is (i) no unfair labor practice complaint
pending or, to the best knowledge of any of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
threatened against any of the Company and its Subsidiaries before any

penalty, fine, or Lien resulting from the non-payment thereof and with respect
to which adequate reserves have been set aside for the payment thereof, or (ii)

         4.17 Patents, Trademarks, Copyrights and Licenses. Each of the Company
and its Subsidiaries owns or licenses or otherwise has the right to use all
licenses, permits, trademarks, trademark applications, patents, patent
applications, service marks, tradenames, copyrights, copyright applications,

applications and tradenames, material licenses, permits, patents, patent
applications, service marks, copyrights, copyright applications, franchises,
authorizations and other intellectual property rights of each of the Company and

with, any rights owned by any other Person, and no claim or litigation regarding
any of the foregoing is pending or threatened, except for such infringements and

aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. To the best knowledge of each of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, no patent, invention, device, application,

with ERISA and the IRC, (ii) no Termination Event has occurred nor is reasonably
expected to occur with respect to any Employee Plan, (iii) the most recent
annual report (Form 5500 Series) with respect to each



                                       19
<PAGE>

Employee Plan, including any required Schedule B (Actuarial Information)
thereto, copies of which have been filed with the IRS and delivered to
Noteholders, is complete and correct and fairly presents the funding status of
such Employee Plan, and since the date of such report there has been no material
adverse change in such funding status, (iv) no Employee Plan had an accumulated
or waived funding deficiency or permitted decreases which would create a
deficiency in its funding standard account or has applied for an extension of
any amortization period within the meaning of Section 412 of the IRC at any time
during the previous 60 months, and (v) no Lien imposed under the IRC or ERISA
exists or is likely to arise on account of any Employee Plan within the meaning

withdrawal liability under ERISA with respect to any Multiemployer Plan, or are
aware of any facts indicating that the Company, its Subsidiaries, or any of
their ERISA Affiliates may in the future incur any such withdrawal liability.
Except as required by Section 4980B of the IRC, none of the Company, its
Subsidiaries, or any of their ERISA Affiliates maintains an employee welfare
benefit plan (as defined in Section 3(l) of ERISA) which provides health or
welfare benefits (through the purchase of insurance or otherwise) for any
retired or former employee of the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of its ERISA
Affiliates or coverage after a participant's termination of employment. None of
the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their ERISA Affiliates has incurred any
liability or obligation under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification
Act ("WARN") or similar state law, which remains unpaid or unsatisfied.

         4.20 Registration Under Exchange Act, Registration Rights. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has registered any class of its securities
pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act and no such registration is required
by the Exchange Act. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is under
any obligation to register, under the Securities Act, any of its presently
outstanding securities or any securities which may hereafter be issued.

         4.21 Full Disclosure. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has
disclosed to Noteholders all agreements, instruments and corporate or other
restrictions to which it is subject, and all other matters known to it, that are
reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect. None of the other reports,
financial statements, certificates, or other information taken as a whole
furnished by or on behalf of any of the Company and its Subsidiaries to
Noteholders in connection with the negotiation of this Agreement or delivered
hereunder (as modified or supplemented by other information so furnished)
contains any misstatement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact
necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances
under which it was made, not misleading; provided, however, that, with respect
to projected financial information, the Company represents only that such
information was prepared in good faith based upon assumptions believed to be
reasonable at the time made.

                                       20
<PAGE>

be reasonably required by Noteholders. Schedule 4.22 sets forth a list of all
insurance maintained by each of the Company and its Subsidiaries on the date
hereof.

         4.23 Joint Ventures. The Company and its Subsidiaries do not own,
directly or indirectly, any equity interest in any Person other than the
Subsidiaries listed on Schedule 4.5 and the Joint Ventures listed on Schedule
4.23. Schedule 4.23 sets forth as of the date hereof a list of all Joint
Ventures in which any of the Company and its Subsidiaries has an equity interest
and the direct or indirect percentage ownership interest of such Person therein.

         4.24 Permits, Etc. Except as set forth on Schedule 4.24, (A) each of
the Company and its Subsidiaries has, and is in compliance with, all permits,
licenses, authorizations, approvals, entitlements and accreditations required
for such Person lawfully to own, lease, manage or operate, or to acquire, each
business currently owned, leased, managed or operated, or to be acquired, by
such Person, except where the failure to possess or noncompliance is not
reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect and (B) no condition exists
or event has occurred which, in itself or with the giving of notice or lapse of
time or both, would result in the suspension, revocation, impairment,
forfeiture, or non-renewal of any such permit, license, authorization, approval,
entitlement, or accreditation, and there is no claim that any thereof is not in
full force and effect.

faith by Holdings, and have been based on assumptions believed by Holdings to be
reasonable at the time made and upon the best information then reasonably
available to Holdings, and such that Holdings was not aware of any facts or

be done all things necessary to preserve and keep in full force and effect its

         5.3 Certain Tax Matters.

                  (a) In the event (i) of a Final Determination (as defined
below) that, due to any reason (including by reason of any of the terms of
Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock) other than an act or
failure to act of any Noteholder (including by reason of the application of IRC
Section 246(c) or IRC Section 246A) or any Noteholder being other than a
corporation, dividends paid or accrued or deemed paid or accrued on the December
2002 Preferred Stock are not eligible for the dividends received deduction
provided under the Dividends Deduction Laws (the "DIVIDENDS-RECEIVED
DEDUCTION"), (ii) any Dividends Deduction Law or any similar or corresponding
state or local law is amended to reduce or eliminate or otherwise limit the
Dividends-Received Deduction available to any Noteholder or (iii) any dividend
with respect to the December 2002 Preferred Stock does not constitute, in whole
or in part, a dividend for federal income tax purposes or such dividend is
subject to Section 1059 of the IRC (in either case, an "EXCESS DISTRIBUTION"),
the Company shall pay to Noteholders with respect to each such dividend payment,
no later than the Payment Date (as defined below), an additional payment (the
"GROSS-UP PAYMENT") such that the net amount of such Gross-Up Payment received
and retained by such Noteholder after payment by such Noteholder of any federal,
state and local income tax payable with respect to such Gross-Up Payment shall
equal, in the case of (i) or (ii) above, the difference between (x) the federal,
state, and local income tax payable by such Noteholder with respect to such
dividend in its taxable year in which the dividend was paid or deemed paid and
(y) the federal, state, and local income tax which would have been payable by
such Noteholder in its taxable year in which the dividend was paid or deemed
paid if the events described in (i) or (ii) had not occurred and in the case of
(iii) above, an amount which, when taken together with the aggregate
distributions (whether treated as dividends or Excess Distributions for federal
income tax purposes) paid or deemed paid to such Noteholder during any taxable
year, would cause such Noteholders' net yield in dollars (after taking into
effect the federal income tax consequences of treating the Excess Distributions
received by such Noteholder as capital gain received upon the taxable sale or
exchange of the December 2002 Preferred Stock) to be equal to the net yield in
dollars which would have been received by such Noteholder had none of the
distributions paid or deemed paid to such Noteholder during such taxable year
constituted Excess Distributions, in all cases together with any interest or
penalties actually payable by such Noteholder to the IRS or any other applicable
taxing authority by reason of such events.

                  (b) A "FINAL DETERMINATION" shall mean (i) a decision,
judgment, decree, or other order by any court of competent jurisdiction, which
decision, judgment, decree or other order has become final or (ii) a closing
agreement entered into under Section 7121 (or any successor to such Section) of
the IRC or any corresponding provision of state or local law, or any other
settlement agreement entered into in connection with an administrative or
judicial proceeding and consented to by a Noteholder or any member of its
consolidated group. The "PAYMENT DATE" shall mean the date that is 90 days after
the end of the relevant taxable year.

                  (c) If any Noteholder is notified formally or informally of
any audit, examination, or proceeding by the IRS or any other taxing authority
with respect to the availability of the Dividends-Received Deduction, such
Noteholder shall promptly notify the Company of such audit, examination, or
proceeding; provided, however, that such Noteholder's failure to give such
notice or to keep the Company fully informed concerning a Contest (as



                                       27
<PAGE>

defined below) shall not affect the Company's obligation to make Gross-Up
Payments in accordance with this Section. Such Noteholder shall have exclusive
control and responsibility to conduct any audit, examination, proceeding, or
litigation (a "CONTEST") with respect to such issue.

                  (d) All subsequent holders of the December 2002 Preferred
Stock shall be entitled to all of the benefits of this Section; provided that
any such subsequent holders qualifies for the Dividends-Received Deduction under
the then current Dividend Deductions Laws at the time of its acquisition of the
December 2002 Preferred Stock.

         5.4 Status of Dividends. The Company will not (i) in any income tax
return or claim for refund of income tax or other submission to the IRS or other
taxing authority claim a deduction in respect of amounts paid or payable under
the December 2002 Preferred Stock, whether as interest or pursuant to any other
statutory provisions or regulation now in effect or hereafter enacted or
adopted, except to the extent that any such deduction shall not, in the opinion
of counsel satisfactory to Noteholders, operate to jeopardize the availability
to any Noteholder of the dividends received deduction provided by Section
243(a)(l) of the IRC, or any successor provision or any similar or corresponding
provision under state or local law (collectively, the "DIVIDENDS DEDUCTION
LAWS"), (ii) in any Company report to stockholders, or to any governmental body
having jurisdiction over the Company or otherwise treat the December 2002
Preferred Stock other than as equity capital or the dividends paid thereon other
than as dividends paid on equity capital unless required to do so by a
governmental body having jurisdiction over the accounts of the Company or by a
change in the application of GAAP required as a result of an action by an
authoritative accounting standards setting body, and (iii) except to the extent
permitted in clause (i) above and other than as expressly permitted by this
Agreement or the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation take any
action which would result in dividends paid by the Company on the December 2002
Preferred Stock out of the Company's current or accumulated earnings and profits
being ineligible for the dividends received deduction provided by any Dividends
Deduction Laws.

                                  SCHEDULE 4.6

                             ENFORCEABLE OBLIGATIONS


         Holdings, through its wholly owned subsidiaries, Coram Healthcare
         Corporation of New York and Coram Healthcare Corporation of Greater New
         York, operates home care service agencies under five separate licenses
         issued by the State of New York Department of Health (the
         "Department"). The contemplated transaction may be viewed by the
         Department as a change of controlling person in the operators of these
         agencies. If so, applications for approval of the transaction would be
         required to be filed with the Department within thirty (30) days of
         consummation of the contemplated transaction pursuant to state
         licensure laws. Under such circumstances, if the transaction has
         already been consummated and approval is not ultimately obtained, the
         licensed entity may be subject to fines, an order to cease the licensed
         operations, and/or an order to divest itself of the ownership of the
         subject home care service agencies.

                                  SCHEDULE 4.7

                               FINANCIAL CONDITION


1.       On March 7, 2002, the Bankruptcy Court ordered the appointment of Arlin
         M. Adams, Esq. as the Chapter 11 Trustee in the bankruptcy proceedings
         of the Company and Holdings. Under the Bankruptcy Code, a Chapter 11
         Trustee assumes management functions of the debtors business. In the
         case of the Company, at this time the Chapter 11 Trustee has retained
         the existing management of the Company to oversee the Company's
         day-to-day operations while the Chapter 11 Trustee oversees the
         Company's management.

2.       Daniel D. Crowley, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President of
         the Company and Holdings, has notified the Chapter 11 Trustee that he
         would not exercise a renewal of his employment contract. Mr. Crowley's
         contract was set to expire on its terms on November 29, 2002. However,
         such employment contract was extended through December 31, 2002 by the
         mutual agreement of the parties. Mr. Crowley and the Chapter 11 Trustee
         are now negotiating to determine what role, if any, Mr. Crowley will
         have with the Company and Holdings following such date.

                                   LITIGATION


         1. T(2) MEDICAL, INC. AND CORAM HEALTHCARE CORPORATION V. COMMISSIONER
OF INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE. In August of 1999, Holdings and T(2) Medical, Inc.
("T(2)") filed a petition in the Tax Court disputing a statutory notice of
deficiency received from the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") associated with
the 1995 tax year and related tax refund. The IRS disputed several deductions
taken by T(2) and is demanding the return of certain refunds received plus the
payment of interest and penalties. Holdings and T(2) have entered into a
Settlement Agreement with the IRS and the Joint Committee on Taxation of the
United States Congress has approved such Settlement Agreement. If approved by
the Chapter 11 Trustee and the Bankruptcy Court, this Settlement would result in
a federal tax liability of approximately $9.9 million, plus interest of
approximately $8.8 million as of November 15, 2002. The federal income tax
adjustment would also give rise to additional state tax liabilities. If Holdings
is not able to negotiate an installment payment plan on favorable terms with the
IRS, or if the Bankruptcy Court or the Chapter 11 Trustee do not approve the
proposed settlement, or any such installment payment plan, the financial
position and liquidity of Holdings and the Company could be materially adversely
affected.

         2. THE OFFICIAL COMMITTEE OF THE UNSECURED CREDITORS OF THE RESOURCE
NETWORK SUBSIDIARIES V. CORAM HEALTHCARE CORPORATION, ET AL. On November 13,
2001, the Official Committee of the Unsecured Creditors of the Coram Resource
Network, Inc. and Coram Independent Practice Association (collectively, the
"Resource Network Subsidiaries"), filed a complaint, subsequently amended twice,
naming Holdings, the Company, several current and former officers and directors
of Holdings and the Company and the Company's Noteholders as defendants. The
Second Amended Complaint includes RICO, fraud, fraudulent conveyance,
preference, breach of fiduciary duty, conversion and other claims. The Second
Amended Complaint demands compensatory damages in excess of $55 million,
punitive damages and the disallowance of Holding's proof of claim in the
Resource Network Subsidiaries' Chapter 11 case. The defendants, including
Holdings and the Company have filed motions to dismiss, which are pending.
Motions seeking the withdrawal of the reference of the case from the Bankruptcy
Court to the District Court have been filed by certain of the defendants. These
motions, which are opposed by Holdings and the Company, are pending. Meanwhile,
discovery is proceeding under a case management order entered by the Bankruptcy
Court. The Company notified its insurance carrier of the second amended
complaint and intends to avail itself of any appropriate insurance coverage for
its directors and officers, who are also vigorously contesting the allegations.
Principally due to the early stages of the aforementioned Resource Network
Subsidiaries' matters, the ultimate outcome thereof cannot be predicted with any
degree of certainty, nor can management predict the scope and nature of any
indemnification that the directors and officers may have with the Company's
insurance carrier.

         3. THREATENED DERIVATIVE CLAIM OF THE OFFICIAL COMMITTEE OF THE EQUITY
SECURITY HOLDERS. In February of 2001, the Equity Committee in the Company's
Chapter 11 case filed a motion with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District
of Delaware seeking permission to bring a derivative lawsuit directly against
Holdings' and the Company's Chief




                                      S-17
<PAGE>

Executive Officer, Daniel Crowley, Stephen Feinberg, a former board member of
Holdings and Cerberus Partners, L.P. a party to the Company's Debtor in
Possession Financing Agreement, Senior Credit Facility and Securities Exchange
Agreement. The Equity Committee's proposed lawsuit alleges that the defendants
conspired to devalue the Company for the benefit of the Company's creditors. On
February 26, 2001, the Bankruptcy Court ruled that prosecution of the Equity
Committee's complaint would not be productive at that time and, accordingly, the
motion was denied without prejudice. In January 2002, the Equity Committee filed
a substantially similar motion with the Bankruptcy Court, which named the
Company's noteholders as prospective defendants. On February 12, 2002, in
connection with the appointment of the Chapter 11 Trustee, the Bankruptcy Court
again denied the renewed motion without prejudice. On or about December 19,
2002, the Equity Committee filed a disclosure statement and proposed plan of
reorganization (see Docket Nos. 2115, 2119, 2021 and 2022). The plan, if
confirmed, would permit the derivative claim to be prosecuted by a litigation
trust. The Company cannot predict whether the plan will be confirmed nor can it
predict the scope and nature of any indemnification obligations that the Company
may have with regard to current and former directors and officers who may be
named in such a derivative action. Moreover, the Company also cannot predict if
any other actions taken by the Equity Committee will have consequences adverse
to the Company.

         4. ARBITRATION DEMAND OF TBOB ENTERPRISES. INC. F/K/A MEDICAL
MANAGEMENT SERVICES OF OMAHA, INC. AGAINST HOLDINGS. In July 2000, TBOB
Enterprises, Inc. ("TBOB") filed an arbitration demand against Holdings claiming
that Holdings breached its obligations under an agreement entered into by the
parties in 1996 relating to a prior earn-out obligation of Holdings' affiliate,
Curaflex Health Services, Inc. ("Curaflex"), that originated from Curaflex's
acquisition of the claimant's prescription services business in 1993. Holdings
and Curaflex operated the business under the name "Coram Prescription Services"
("CPS"), and the assets of the CPS business were sold on July 31, 2000. TBOB
alleges, among other things, that Holdings has impaired the earn-out payments
due TBOB by improperly charging certain expenses to the CPS business and failing
to fulfill the Holdings' commitments to enhance the value of CPS by marketing
its services. The TBOB demand claims damages of more than $898,000. Holdings has
retained outside counsel on this matter and an answer was filed. This matter has
been stayed pending the resolution of the Chapter 11 Cases.

         5. ALAN FURST ET AL. V. STEPHEN FEINBERG, ET AL. Alan Furst and Michael
S. Harrison, individually and on behalf of all persons similarly situated, filed
a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey
on November 8, 2000 and an Amended Class Action Complaint was filed on November
15, 2000, alleging that certain current and former officers and directors of
Holdings and the Company and the Company's principal lenders, Cerberus Partners,
L.P., Foothill Capital Corporation and Goldman, Sachs & Co., implemented a
scheme to perpetrate a fraud upon the stock market regarding the common stock of
Holdings. A Second Amended Class Action Complaint (the "Second Amended
Complaint") filed on March 21, 2001, removed as defendants all of the officers
and directors of the Company as defendants, except for the Company's Chief
Executive Officer and a former member of Holdings' Board of Directors. The
plaintiffs' purported class action suit alleges that the defendants artificially
depressed the trading price of the Company's publicly traded shares and created
the false impression that stockholders' equity was decreasing in value and was
ultimately worthless. The plaintiffs further allege that members of the class
sustained total investment




                                      S-18
<PAGE>

losses of $50 million or more. On June 14, 2001, a third Amended Class Action
Complaint (the "Third Amended Complaint") was filed naming the same defendants
as the Second Amended Complaint. The plaintiffs' allegations in the Third
Amended Complaint were substantially similar to the allegations in the Second
Amended Complaint; however, the Third Amended Complaint eliminated references to
the corporate assets of Holdings and the Company. All defendants moved to
dismiss the Third Amended Complaint for failure to state a claim upon which
relief can be granted and, in connection therewith, and, on May 6, 2002 the
District Court granted the defendants' motion to dismiss, with prejudice and
also denied plaintiffs' request for leave to replead. The plaintiffs' appeal to
the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit was denied by an
opinion filed on December 18, 2002. To date, the Holdings' and the Company's
directors and officers liability insurance carrier has paid the costs of defense
of the officers and directors who are defendants in this matter. The Company
cannot predict whether the plaintiffs will seek further appellate review and
management cannot predict the scope and nature of any indemnity obligation the
insurance carrier may have.

         6. RITA F. OLIAI V. CORAM HEALTHCARE CORPORATION. Plaintiff, a former
Vice President of Reimbursement of Holdings, filed suit against Holdings
alleging she was wrongfully terminated in violation of federal and state
anti-discrimination statutes. She further alleges that she was terminated as a
result of discovering certain wrongful claims practices of Holdings. Holdings
denied all allegations in the complaint. Holdings' Motion for Summary Judgment
was granted on three out of Plaintiff's four claims. The only surviving claim is
based on age discrimination. Plaintiff has filed a $5 million proof of claim in
the Chapter 11 Cases of Holdings and the Company. Any liability of Holdings in
this case should be covered by Holdings' insurance carrier. However, such
carrier is now under an Order of Liquidation and it is unclear how such order
may affect Holdings' exposure.

         7. LENEXA, KANSAS DME AUDIT. In August 2000, the Region D DMERC
commenced an audit of certain claims submitted by the Lenexa, Kansas (Kansas
City) branch of Coram Alternate Site Services, Inc. for certain durable medical
equipment ("DME") services rendered to certain Medicare patients in the years
1995, 1996 and 1997. Counsel has been retained, and such counsel retained a
healthcare reimbursement consultant to review the claims submitted by the Kansas
City branch. A review of the Company's DME policies, procedures, and claims
submissions methods has been completed under the direction of outside counsel.
The Company's potential liability exposure cannot be determined at this time.

                                  SCHEDULE 4.16

                             GOVERNMENTAL APPROVALS


         1.       This Agreement and the Transaction Documents are subject to
                  the approval of the Bankruptcy Court as set forth in Section
                  10.11.

         2.       Holdings, through its affiliates, Coram Healthcare Corporation
                  of New York and Coram Healthcare Corporation of Greater New
                  York, operates home care service agencies under five separate
                  licenses issued by the State of New York Department of Health
                  (the "Department"). The contemplated transaction may be viewed
                  by the Department as a change of controlling person in the
                  operators of these agencies. If so, applications for approval
                  of the transaction would be required to be filed with the
                  Department within thirty (30) days of consummation of the
                  contemplated transaction pursuant to state licensure laws.
                  Under such circumstances, if the transaction has already been
                  consummated and approval is not ultimately obtained, the
                  licensed entity may be subject to fines, an order to cease the

Holdings, through its affiliates, Coram Healthcare Corporation of New York and
Coram Healthcare Corporation of Greater New York, operates home care service
agencies under five separate licenses issued by the State of New York Department
of Health (the "Department"). The contemplated transaction may be viewed by the
Department as a change of controlling person in the operators of these agencies.
If so, applications for approval of the transaction would be required to be
filed with the Department within thirty (30) days of consummation of the
contemplated transaction pursuant to state licensure laws. Under such
circumstances, if the transaction has already been consummated and approval is
not ultimately obtained, the licensed entity may be subject to fines, an order
to cease the licensed operations, and/or an order to divest itself of the
ownership of the subject home care service agencies.

A.       Payments during November and December 2002 may reduce this balance.

B.       The Company may finance all or part of its proposed stationary pump
         purchase listed on Schedule 5.2(a).

C.       Estimate of a short-term Insurance Premium Finance Agreement. The
         Company will likely enter into such an agreement in the second quarter
         of 2003 with monthly payments thereunder into the fourth quarter of
         2003.

D.       As noted in section (1) of Schedule 4.14, Litigation, T(2) Medical,
         Inc. ("T(2)") and Holdings are currently attempting to negotiate an
         installment payment plan for their settlement with the Internal Revenue
         Service ("IRS"). Such installment payment plan may require a note
         payable in favor of the IRS. The amount of such note payable would vary
         based on the terms of any such installment payment plan.

                                  STOCKHOLDERS

                  Section 3.1 Annual Meeting. Subject to Section 3.11, the
annual meeting of the stockholders for the election of directors and the
transaction of any other proper business shall be held at such date and time as
the Board of Directors shall determine.

                  Section 3.2 Special Meetings. Subject to Section 3.11, a
special meeting of the stockholders may be called by the Chairman of the Board
of Directors or the President, or by the Board of Directors or by the
stockholders of the Corporation holding at least fifty percent (50%) of the
combined voting power of the then outstanding shares of the Corporation's stock
entitled to vote at such meeting (voting as a single class).

                  Section 3.3 Place of Meeting. The Board of Directors may
designate any place as the place of meeting for any annual or special meeting of
the stockholders. In the absence of such designation, the place of meeting shall
be the principal place of business of the Corporation.

                  Section 3.4 Notice of Meetings. For all meetings of
stockholders, a written notice of the meeting shall be delivered to each
stockholder of record entitled to vote at such meeting, which notice shall state
the place, date and hour of the meeting. For all special meetings and when and
as otherwise required by law, the notice shall state the purpose or purposes of
the meeting. The notice of the meeting shall be given not less than ten (10) nor
more than sixty (60) days before the date of the meeting. Such notice shall be
deemed to have been delivered when sent by registered mail or by confirmed telex
or telecopy, directed to the stockholder at his or her address as it appears in
the records of the Corporation. When a meeting is adjourned to another time or
place, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time and place
thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken and the
adjournment is for not more than thirty (30) days, unless otherwise required by
law.

                  Section 3.5 Quorum. The holders of a majority of the
outstanding stock of the Corporation entitled to vote on a matter, present in
person or represented by proxy, shall be necessary to constitute a quorum for
consideration of such matter at any meeting of the stockholders unless a greater
or lesser number is required by the Certificate of Incorporation. At any
adjourned meeting at which a quorum is present or represented, any business may
be transacted which might have been transacted at the original meeting, unless
otherwise required by law. Withdrawal of stockholders from any meeting shall not
cause failure of a duly constituted quorum at a meeting, unless otherwise
required by law. If a quorum shall fail to attend any meeting, the Chairman of
the meeting or the holders of a majority of the shares of the stock entitled to
vote who are present, in person or by proxy, may adjourn the meeting to another
place and time.

                  Section 3.6 Manner of Acting. The affirmative vote of a
majority of the stock represented at a meeting and entitled to vote on a matter
at which a quorum is present shall be the act of the stockholders, unless the
vote of a greater number or voting by class is required by law or the
Certificate of Incorporation. Each stockholder shall have the number of votes
for every share of stock entitled to vote which is registered in his name on the
record date for the


                                      A-2
<PAGE>


meeting as provided by the rights of such shares, except as otherwise provided
herein or required by law.

                  Section 3.7 Fixing of Record Date. If no record date is fixed
for the determination of stockholders entitled to notice of, or to vote at, a
meeting of stockholders, or stockholders entitled to receive payment of a
dividend, the date on which notice of the meeting is mailed or the close of
business on the day before the date on which the resolution of the Board of
Directors declaring such dividend is adopted, as the case may be, shall be the
record date for such determination of stockholders. If a record date is
specifically set for the purpose of determining stockholders entitled to notice
of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders, or stockholders entitled to
receive payment of any dividend, or in order to make a determination of
stockholders for any other proper purpose, the Board of Directors may fix in
advance a date as the record date for any such determination of stockholders,
such date in any case to be not more than sixty (60) days and not less than ten
(10) days immediately preceding such meeting or such action. When a
determination of stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders
has been made as provided in this Section, such determination shall apply to any
adjournment thereof.

                  Section 3.8 Proxies. A stockholder may appoint a proxy to vote
or otherwise act for him or her by signing an appointment form and delivering it
to the person so appointed. No proxy shall be valid after the expiration of
three years from the date thereof unless otherwise provided in the proxy. An
appointment of a proxy is revocable by the stockholder unless the appointment
form states that it is irrevocable and if, and only so long as, it is coupled
with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power.

                  Section 3.9 Consent of Stockholders in Lieu of Meeting.
Subject to Section 3.11, any action required to be taken, or which may be taken,
at any annual or special meeting of stockholders may be taken without a meeting,
without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent in writing, setting forth
the action so taken, shall be signed by the holders of shares of outstanding
stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary
to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to
vote thereon were present and voted.

                  Section 3.10 Notice to Stockholders Not Consenting. Prompt
notice of the taking of corporate action without a meeting by less than
unanimous consent shall be given in writing to those stockholders who have not
consented in writing. In the event that the action which is consented to is such
as would have required the filing of a certificate under any Section of the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware if such action had been voted
on by the stockholders at a meeting thereof, the certificate filed under such
other Section shall state, in lieu of any statement required by such Section
concerning any vote of stockholders, that written consent has been given in
accordance with the provisions of said Section and that written notice to
non-consenting stockholders has been given as provided in this Bylaw.

                  Section 3.11 Special CHC Board Approval. Prior to the giving
of a notice for a stockholders meeting, or the distribution of a stockholders
written consent, of the Corporation, in which it would be proposed to approve or

<PAGE>


or other person to appoint or remove any of the members of the Board of
Directors of the Corporation, (b) the appointment, removal or termination of
office of any of the members of the Board of Directors of the Corporation, or
(c) any change, which relates to the subject matter of the preceding clauses (a)
and (b), in the Certificate of Incorporation and bylaws of the Corporation or
the Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Designation or the Series B

consent, must be approved in writing by a majority of the independent members of
the Board of Directors of Coram Healthcare Corporation ("CHC") prior to the
giving of a notice for such stockholders meeting or the distribution of such

Directors.

                  Section 4.2 Number, Tenure and Resignation. The authorized

than seven (7) (of which the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock of the
Corporation shall be entitled to elect up to a number of directors that
constitutes less than half of the total directors, but such number shall not be
more than two (2) during such time that any shares of the Series A Preferred
Stock are outstanding prior to a Triggering Event), and such number may be
changed from time to time within such specified limit by a duly adopted
resolution of the Board of Directors; provided, however, that no decrease in the
number of directors shall have the effect of shortening the term of any
incumbent director (unless such decrease results in the holders of the Series A
Preferred Stock having elected half or more of the directors of the Corporation
in which case the term of one or more of the directors elected by the holders of
the Series A Preferred Stock shall be immediately terminated in order to bring
the number of directors of the Corporation elected by the holders of the Series
A Preferred Stock to less than half of the total directors of the Corporation).
The directors of the Corporation shall be elected by a plurality vote of the
shares of the Corporation's stock represented in person or by proxy at the
annual meeting of the stockholders and entitled to vote on the election of
directors of the Corporation. Each director shall hold office until the last to
occur of the next annual meeting of stockholders or until his successor shall
have been elected and qualified, or until his earlier written resignation or
removal in the manner herein provided. A director may resign at any time by
written notice to the Board of Directors, its Chairman, the President or the
Secretary. The resignation is effective on the date it bears, or its designated
effective date. For purposes of these Bylaws, "Triggering Event" means, at any
time (from and after April 13, 2002), the earliest to occur of the following:

                  (i) a plan of reorganization for the Corporation and/or CHC is

         of the Corporation, such stockholders meeting or stockholders written
         consent has been approved in writing by a majority of the independent

         notice for such stockholders meeting or the distribution of such
         stockholders written consent), in which it would be proposed to approve
         or be approved (a) any change in the identity of the members of the
         Board of Directors of either the Corporation or CHC or the rights of
         any stockholder, director or other person to appoint or remove any of
         the directors of either the Corporation or CHC, (b) the appointment,
         removal or termination of office of any of the directors of either the

         Incorporation or bylaws of the Corporation or CHC, or the Second
         Amended and Restated Certificate of Designation or the Series B
         Certificate of Designation;

                  (iii) the giving of a notice for a meeting of the Board of
         Directors (other than a Board of Directors meeting of CHC called by

         Directors and/or as the Chief Executive Officer of CHC), or the
         distribution of a written consent of the Board of Directors, of either
         the Corporation or CHC (provided, that, with respect to a Board of
         Directors meeting or a Board of Directors written consent of the
         Corporation, such Board of Directors meeting or Board of Directors
         written consent has been approved in writing by a majority of the
         independent members of the Board of Directors of CHC prior to the
         giving of a notice for such Board of Directors meeting or the
         distribution of such Board of Directors written consent), in which it
         would be proposed to approve or be approved (a) any change in the

         Corporation or CHC, (b) the appointment, removal or termination of
         office of any of the directors of either the Corporation or CHC or (c)
         any change, which relates to the subject matter of the preceding
         clauses (a) and (b), in the Certificate of Incorporation or bylaws of
         the Corporation or CHC, or the Second Amended and Restated Certificate
         of Designation or the Series B Certificate of Designation; and

                  (iv) entry of an order of a court of competent jurisdiction
         (other than an order resulting from a motion of Cerberus Partners,
         L.P., Foothill Capital Corporation, Goldman, Sachs & Co. or any of
         their Affiliates) compelling a stockholders meeting or a Board of
         Directors meeting of the Corporation or CHC, in which it would be
         proposed to approve or be approved (a) any change in the identity of
         the members of the Board of Directors of either the Corporation or CHC
         or the rights of any stockholder, director or other person to appoint
         or remove any of the directors of either the Corporation or CHC, (b)
         the appointment, removal or termination of office of any of the
         directors of either the Corporation or CHC or (c) any change, which
         relates to the subject matter of the preceding clauses (a) and (b), in
         the Certificate of Incorporation or the bylaws of the Corporation or
         CHC or the Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Designation or
         the Series B Certificate of Designation.

                  Section 4.3 Quorum and Manner of Acting. A majority of the
Board of Directors shall be necessary to constitute a quorum for the transaction
of business at any meeting of the Board of Directors. If a quorum shall fail to
attend any meeting, the Chairman of the


                                      A-5
<PAGE>


meeting or a majority of the directors who are present at the meeting may
adjourn the meeting to another place and time.

                  Section 4.4 Manner of Acting. The act of a majority of the
directors shall be the act of the Board of Directors, unless the act of a
greater number is required by law or these Bylaws.

                  Section 4.5 Vacancies. Any vacancy occurring in the Board of
Directors and any directorship to be filled by reason of an increase in the
number of directors may be filled by election at an annual meeting or at a
special meeting of stockholders called for that purpose. The Board of Directors
may appoint a director to fill a vacancy at any regular or special meeting of
the Board of Directors to hold office until a meeting of stockholders is held. A
director elected by the stockholders to fill a vacancy shall hold office for the
balance of the term for which he or she was elected.

                  Section 4.6 Removal of Directors. One or more of the directors
may be removed, with or without cause, at a meeting of stockholders, by the
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding stock then
entitled to vote at an election of directors. No director shall be removed at a
meeting of stockholders unless the notice of such meeting shall state that a
purpose of the meeting is to vote upon the removal of one or more directors
named in the notice. Only the named director or directors may be removed at such
meeting.

                  Section 4.7 Regular Meetings. Subject to Section 4.14, a
regular meeting of the Board of Directors shall be held without other notice
than this Bylaw, immediately after, and, at the same place as, the annual
meeting of stockholders. The Board of Directors may provide, by resolution, the
place, date and hour for the holding of additional regular meetings of the Board
of Directors, without other notice than such resolution.

                  Section 4.8 Special Meetings. Subject to Section 4.14, special
meetings of the Board of Directors may be called by or at the request of the
President or a majority of the directors.

given to each director at least ten (10) days prior to the meeting by written
notice directed to each director at his or her place of business. Such notice
shall be deemed to have been delivered when sent by registered mail, or by
confirmed telex or telecopy, to each director at his or her business address.
Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of any regular or
special meeting of the Board of Directors need be specified in the notice or
waiver of notice of such meeting. The attendance of a director at any meeting
shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except where a director
attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting to the transaction of any
business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened.

                  Section 4.10 Committees. A majority of the directors by
resolution may designate one or more committees, with any lawfully delegable
power and authority, and appoint members of the Board of Directors to serve on

law.

4.14, any action required by the General Corporation law of the State of
Delaware to be taken at a meeting of the Board of Directors or any other action
which may be taken at a meeting of the Board of Directors or a committee
thereof, may be taken without a meeting if a consent in writing, setting forth
the action so taken, shall be signed by all the directors entitled to vote with
respect to the subject matter thereof, or by all members of such committee, as
the case may be, entitled to vote with respect thereto.

                  Section 4.12 Meeting by Conference Telephone. Members of the
Board of Directors or any committee designated by such Board of Directors may
participate in and act at any meeting of the Board of Directors or committee by
means of conference telephone or other similar communication equipment by means
of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other.
Participation in a meeting pursuant hereto shall constitute presence in person
at such meeting.

                  Section 4.13 Compensation. The Board of Directors, by the
affirmative vote of a majority of the directors then in office shall have
authority to establish reasonable compensation of all directors for services to
the Corporation as directors, officers or otherwise.

office of any of the members of the Board of Directors of the Corporation, or
(c) any change, which relates to the subject matter of the preceding clauses (a)

The Corporation filed a Certificate of Designation for Series A Preferred Stock
with the Delaware Secretary of State on December 29, 2000, which has been
amended by the Certificate of Amendment of Certificate of Designation filed with
the Delaware Secretary of State on December 31, 2001 and by the Second
Certificate of Amendment of Certificate of Designation filed with the Delaware
Secretary of State on December 31, 2002 (the "Amended and Restated Certificate

Section 5 of the Amended and Restated Certificate of Designation, Section 5 of

                                    ARTICLE 8
          INDEMNIFICATION OF OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES AND AGENTS

                  Section 8.1 Right to Indemnification. Each person who was or
is a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is involved (as a party,
witness, or otherwise), in any threatened, pending, or completed action, suit,
or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative
(hereinafter a "Proceeding"), by reason of the fact that he or she, or a person
of whom he or she is the legal representative, is or was a director, officer,
employee, or agent of the Corporation or is or was serving at the request of the
Corporation as a director, officer, employee, or agent of another corporation or
of a partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise, including service
with respect to employee benefit plans, whether the basis of the Proceeding is
alleged action in an official capacity as a director, officer, employee, or
agent or in any other capacity while serving as a director, officer, employee,
or agent (hereafter an "Agent"), shall be indemnified and held harmless by the
Corporation to the fullest extent authorized by the Delaware General Corporation
Law, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended or interpreted (but, in the
case of any such amendment or interpretation, only to the extent that such
amendment or interpretation permits the Corporation to provide broader
indemnification rights than were permitted prior thereto) against all expenses,
liability, and loss (including attorneys' fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise
taxes or penalties, and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement, and any
interest, assessments, or other charges imposed thereon, and any federal, state,
local, or foreign taxes imposed on any Agent as a result of the actual or deemed
receipt of any payments under this Article 8) reasonably incurred or suffered by
such person in connection with investigating, defending, being a witness in, or
participating in


                                      A-11
<PAGE>
(including on appeal), or preparing for any of the foregoing in, any Proceeding
(hereinafter "Expenses"); provided, however, that, except as provided in Section
8.3 of this Article 8, the Corporation shall indemnify any such Agent seeking
indemnification in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by
such person only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the
Corporation's Board of Directors. The right to indemnification conferred in this
Article 8 shall be a contract right.

                  Section 8.2 Authority to Advance Expenses. Expenses incurred
by an officer or director in defending a Proceeding (whether the basis of the
Proceeding is an alleged action in an official capacity or in any other capacity
while serving as a director or officer, including, without limitation, service
to an employee benefit plan) shall be paid by the Corporation in advance of the
final disposition of such Proceeding, provided, however, that such Expenses
incurred by a director or officer in his capacity as a director or officer shall
be advanced only upon delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking by or on
behalf of such director or officer to repay such amount if it shall ultimately
be determined that he is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as
authorized in this Article 8 or otherwise. Expenses incurred by other Agents of
the Corporation may be advanced upon such terms and conditions as the Board of
Directors deems appropriate. Any obligation to reimburse the Corporation for
Expense advances shall be unsecured and no interest shall be charged thereon.

                  Section 8.3 Right of Claimant to Bring Suit. If a claim under
Section 8.1 or 8.2 of this Article 8 is not paid in full by the Corporation
within ninety (90) days after a written claim has been received by the
Corporation, the claimant may at any time thereafter bring suit against the
Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim and, if successful in
whole or in part, the claimant shall be entitled to be paid also the expense
(including attorneys' fees) of prosecuting such claim. The burden of proof of
such proceeding shall be on the claimant to establish that such claimant is
entitled to be indemnified under this Article 8. It shall be a defense to any
such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses
incurred in defending a Proceeding in advance of its final disposition where the
required undertaking has been tendered to the Corporation) that the claimant has
not met the standards of conduct that make it permissible under the Delaware
General Corporation Law for the Corporation to indemnify the claimant for the
amount claimed. The burden of proving such a defense shall be on the
Corporation. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its Board of
Directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a
determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of
the claimant is proper under the circumstances because he has met the applicable
standard of conduct set forth in the Delaware General Corporation Law, nor an
actual determination by the Corporation (including its Board of Directors,
independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the claimant had not met
such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create
a presumption that claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct.

                  Section 8.4 Provisions Nonexclusive. The rights conferred on
any person by this Article 8 shall not be exclusive of any other rights that
such person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the
Certificate of Incorporation, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested
directors, or otherwise, both as to action in an official capacity and as to
action in another capacity while holding, such office. To the extent that any
provision of


                                      A-12
<PAGE>


the Certificate of Incorporation, agreement, or vote of the stockholders or
disinterested directors is inconsistent with these Bylaws, the provision,
agreement, or vote shall take precedence.

                  Section 8.5 Authority to Insure. The Corporation may purchase
and maintain insurance to protect itself and any Agent against any Expense,
whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify the Agent
against such Expense under applicable law or the provisions of this Article 8.

                  Section 8.6 Survival of Rights. The rights provided by this
Article 8 shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be an Agent and shall
inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors, and administrators of such a
person.

                  Section 8.7 Settlement of Claims. The Corporation shall not be
liable to indemnify any Agent under this Article 8: (a) for any amounts paid in
settlement of any action or claim effected without the Corporation's written
consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; or (b) for any
judicial award if the Corporation was not given a reasonable and timely
opportunity, at its expense, to participate in the defense of such action.

                  Section 8.8 Effect of Amendment. Any amendment, repeal, or
modification of this Article 8 shall not adversely affect any right or
protection of any Agent existing at the time of such amendment, repeal, or
modification. This Section 8.8 shall not be altered, amended or repealed in any
respect, nor may any provision inconsistent therewith be adopted, unless such
alteration, amendment, repeal or adoption is made in accordance with Section 7.4
hereof.

                  Section 8.9 Subrogation. In the event of payment under this
Article 8, the Corporation shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to
all of the rights of recovery of the Agent, who shall execute all papers
required and shall do everything that may be necessary to secure such rights,
including the execution of such documents necessary to enable the Corporation
effectively to bring suit to enforce such rights.

                  Section 8.10 No Duplication of Payments. The Corporation shall
not be liable under this Article 8 to make any payment in connection with any
claim made against the Agent to the extent the Agent has otherwise actually
received payment (under any insurance policy, agreement, vote, or otherwise) of
the amounts otherwise indemnifiable hereunder.

                                    ARTICLE 9
                                     NOTICES

                  Section 9.1 Notices. Except as otherwise specifically provided
herein or required by law, all notices required to be given to any stockholder,
director, officer, employee or agent, shall be in writing and may in every
instance be effectively given by hand delivery to the recipient thereof, by
depositing such notice in the mails, postage paid, by sending such notice by
Federal Express or similar overnight courier, by sending such notice by prepaid
telegram or mailgram or by sending such notice by telecopy or similar facsimile
transmission. Any such notice shall be addressed to such stockholder, director,
officer, employee, or agent at his or her last known address as the same appears
on the books of the corporation. The time when such notice is received, if hand
delivered, or dispatched, if delivered through the mails, by overnight


                                      A-13
<PAGE>


courier, by telegram or mailgram, or by telecopy or similar facsimile shall be
the time of the giving of the notice.

                  Section 9.2 Waiver of Notice. Whenever any notice whatever is
required to be given by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or under the
provisions of these Bylaws, a written waiver thereof, signed by the person or
persons entitled to such notice, whether before or after the time stated
therein, shall be deemed equivalent to the giving of such notice. Attendance at
a meeting, whether of directors, stockholders or any other kind, by the person
or persons entitled to such notice shall constitute waiver thereof, except when
the person attends the meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the
beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting
is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business nor the purpose of any
meeting need be specified in such a waiver.

as of the last day of the most recent fiscal month to end within 60 days prior
to such date specified, based on the fair market value of the Company (the
"Company Value"), as determined by a nationally reputable appraisal firm or
investment banking firm selected by the Company and the holders of the Common
Stock (the "Company's Investment Banking Firm"), divided by the number of Fully
Diluted Outstanding shares of Common Stock.

                  (i) The Required Holders shall have a period of 15 days after
         delivery of the Appraised Value to present in writing to the Company's
         Investment Bank (with a copy to the Company and the holders of the

                  (iii) If such dispute cannot be resolved by the Company and
         the holders of the Common Stock, on the one hand, and the Required
         Holders, on the other hand, nor by such Investment Banking Firms within
         30 days after the date of the delivery of the objection by Required
         Holders, then the specific matters in dispute shall be submitted to a
         nationally reputable appraisal firm or investment banking firm mutually

         Common Stock, the Required Holders, the Company's Investment Banking
         Firm and the Required Holders' Investment Banking Firm. The Company's

         the Common Stock and the Required Holders a confirmation of the Company
         Value, as determined by the Mutual Investment Banking Firm, and the
         Required Holders' Investment Banking Firm shall send a letter to the
         Company, the holders of the Common Stock and the Required Holders
         confirming that such confirmed or revised Company Value is in
         accordance with such determination, whereupon the confirmed or revised
         Company Value shall be binding on such parties.

                  (iv) The parties hereto shall cooperate with each other and
         each other's authorized representatives and with Mutual Investment
         Banking Firm in order that any and all matters in dispute shall be

         3. Dividends.

                  (a) So long as any shares of Preferred Stock shall be
outstanding, the holders of such Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive
out of any funds legally available therefor, preferential dividends at the
Dividend Rate on the Liquidation Preference hereunder, payable quarterly on the
last Business Day of each calendar quarter. Such dividends shall be cumulative
and begin to accrue from the Original Issue Date, whether or not declared and

date of a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization with respect to the Company, in the

                  (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
if, on any date, an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing,

then the Dividend Rate on the shares of Preferred Stock shall be increased to a
compound annual rate of 16%, for as long as such Event of Default is continuing.

         4. Liquidation Rights of Preferred Stock.

                  (a) In the event of any sale, liquidation, dissolution or
winding up of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary, the holders of
Preferred Stock then outstanding shall be entitled to be paid out of the assets
of the Company available for distribution to its stockholders, whether such
assets are capital, surplus or earnings, before any payment or declaration and
setting apart for payment of any amount shall be made in respect of any shares
of Common Stock or any share of any other class or series of the Company's
preferred stock ranking junior to the Preferred Stock with respect to the
payment of dividends or distribution of assets on the sale, liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of the Company, an amount equal to the Liquidation
Preference plus all declared or accrued and unpaid dividends in respect of any
sale, liquidation, dissolution or winding up consummated.

                  (b) If upon any sale, liquidation, dissolution or winding up
of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary, the assets to be distributed
among the holders of Preferred Stock shall be insufficient to permit the payment
to such stockholders of the full preferential amounts aforesaid, then the entire
assets of the Company to be distributed shall be distributed ratably among the
holders of Preferred Stock, based on the full preferential amounts for the
number of shares of Preferred Stock held by each holder.

                  (c) After payment to the holders of Preferred Stock of the
amounts set forth in Section 4(a), the entire remaining assets and funds of the
Company legally available for distribution, if any, shall be distributed among
the holders of any preferred stock of the Company entitled to a preference over
the Common Stock in accordance with the terms thereof and, thereafter, to the
holders of Common Stock and Preferred Stock, in proportion to their ownership of
such shares.

         5. Voting Rights. In addition to any voting rights provided by law
(which rights, except as may be prohibited by law, are subject to the provisions
for dilution and the limitations set forth in Section 5(a) hereof), the holders
of shares of Preferred Stock shall have the following voting rights:

                  (a) Subject to the provisions for dilution and the limitations
hereinafter set forth, so long as any of the Preferred Stock is outstanding,
each share of Preferred Stock shall


                                       B-8
<PAGE>


entitle the holder thereof to vote on all matters voted on by the holders of
Common Stock, voting together as a single class with other shares entitled to
vote at all meetings of the stockholders of the Company. The number of votes
which a holder of Preferred Stock is entitled to cast, as the same may be
adjusted from time to time as hereinafter provided (which adjustment is subject
to the limitations set forth in this Section 5(a)), is hereinafter referred to
as the "Vote Multiple," which, as of the first of the Original Issue Dates, will
be equal to one per each share of Preferred Stock. In the event the Company
shall at any time after the first of the Original Issue Dates declare or pay any
dividend on Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, or effect a
subdivision or split or a combination, consolidation or reverse split of the
outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater or lesser number of shares of
Common Stock, or issue additional shares of Common Stock at a purchase price
which is less than the Appraised Value of such shares on the date of issuance,
then in each such case the Vote Multiple thereafter applicable to the
determination of the number of votes per share which holders of shares of
Preferred Stock are entitled to cast after such event shall be the Vote Multiple
immediately prior to such event multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which
is the number of shares of Common Stock and Preferred Stock outstanding
immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of
shares of Common Stock and Preferred Stock that were outstanding immediately
prior to such event. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision to the
contrary set forth in the Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws of the Company
or this Certificate of Designation or in any other document relating to the
voting rights of the holders of the shares of the Preferred Stock, the "Vote
Multiple" applicable to the determination of the number of votes per share which
holders of shares of Preferred Stock are entitled to cast shall at all times be
adjusted to the extent necessary to ensure that the holders of all shares of
Preferred Stock and all shares of Series B Preferred Stock combined shall not be
entitled to cast more than 49% of the votes on any matter voted on by the
holders of the shares of Common Stock, the holders of Series B Preferred Stock
and the holders of the shares of Preferred Stock, voting together as a single
class.

                  (b) The unanimous affirmative vote of all of the shares of
Preferred Stock, voting together as a class, in person or by proxy, at a special
or annual meeting of stockholders called for the purpose, or pursuant to a
written consent of stockholders shall be necessary to:

                  (i) authorize, adopt or approve an amendment to the
         Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws of the Company or an amendment
         to this Certificate of Designation that would have one of the following
         results: (A) reduce the stated value or Liquidation Preference of, or
         Dividend Rate on, the Preferred Stock, (B) change the place or currency
         of payment or stated value or Liquidation Preference of, or Dividend
         Rate on, the Preferred Stock, (C) impair the right to institute suit
         for the enforcement of any payment on or with respect to the Preferred
         Stock, or (D) reduce the percentage of outstanding shares of Preferred
         Stock necessary to modify or amend the terms hereof or to grant
         waivers;

                  (ii) issue any shares of the capital stock of the Company
         ranking senior to, or pari passu with (either as to dividends or upon
         voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up) the
         Preferred Stock, or issue any securities convertible into, or
         exchangeable for, such shares, except shares of Common Stock and shares
         of Preferred Stock issued in lieu of cash dividends in accordance with
         this Certificate; or


                                       B-9
<PAGE>


                  (iii) take any action which would result in an Organic Change.

                  (c) The holders of shares of Preferred Stock shall have, in
addition to the other voting rights set forth herein, the exclusive right,
voting separately as a single class, to elect up to a number of directors that
constitutes less than half of the total number of directors of the Company;
provided, however, that if the holders of shares of Preferred Stock do not elect
any directors to the Board, then each holder shall have the right to appoint an
observer to the Board.

                  (d) The foregoing rights of holders of shares of Preferred
Stock to take any actions as provided in this Section 5 may be exercised at any
annual meeting of stockholders or at a special meeting of stockholders held for
such purpose as hereinafter provided or at any adjournment thereof or pursuant
to any written consent of stockholders. If (A) the annual meeting of
stockholders of the Company is not, for any reason, held within the time fixed
in the By-laws of the Company, or (B) vacancies shall exist in the offices of
directors elected by the holders of Preferred Stock, a proper officer of the
Company, upon the written request of the holders of record of at least ten
percent (10%) of the shares of Preferred Stock then outstanding, addressed to
the Secretary of the Company, shall call a special meeting in lieu of the annual
meeting of stockholders or a special meeting of the holders of Preferred Stock,
for the purpose of electing or, if necessary, removing directors. Any such
meeting shall be held at the earliest practicable date at the place for the
holding of the annual meetings of stockholders. If such meeting shall not be
called by the proper officer of the Company within twenty (20) days after
personal service of said written request upon the Secretary of the Company, or
within twenty (20) days after mailing the same within the United States by
certified mail, addressed to the Secretary of the Company at its principal
executive offices, then the holders of record of at least ten percent (10%) of
the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock may designate in writing one of their
members to call such meeting at the expense of the Company, and such meeting may
be called by the person so designated upon the notice required for the annual
meetings of stockholders of the Company and shall be held at the place for
holding the annual meetings of stockholders. Any holder of Preferred Stock so
designated shall have access to the lists of stockholders to be called pursuant
to the provisions hereof.

                  (e) Subject to the proviso in Section 4.2 of the By-laws of
the Company, any vacancy occurring in the office of director elected by the
holders of Preferred Stock may be filled by the remaining director(s) elected by
the holders of Preferred Stock unless and until such vacancy shall be filled by
the holders of Preferred Stock. The term of office of the directors elected by
the holders of Preferred Stock shall terminate upon the election of their
successors at any meeting of the holders of the shares of Preferred Stock held
for the purpose of electing directors.

                  (f) Subject to the proviso in Section 4.2 of the By-laws of
the Company, the directors elected by the holders of shares of Preferred Stock
voting separately as a single class may be removed from office with or without
cause by the vote of the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding
shares of Preferred Stock. A special meeting of the holders of shares of
Preferred Stock may be called in accordance with the procedures set forth in
Section 5(d) above.

                  (a) The Company may, at any time, redeem, and the holders of
the outstanding Preferred Stock shall sell to the Company, at the redemption
price equal to the sum of the Liquidation Preference per share plus an amount
equal to all accrued and unpaid dividends per share (the "Redemption Price"),
all or a portion of the outstanding Preferred Stock.

                  (b) (i) At least thirty (30) days prior to the date fixed for
the redemption of the Preferred Stock, written notice (the "Redemption Notice")
shall be mailed, postage prepaid, to each holder of record of the Preferred
Stock at its post office address last shown on the records of the Company. The
Redemption Notice shall state:

                      (1) the number of shares of Preferred Stock held by the
holder that the Company intends to redeem;

                      (2) the date fixed for redemption and the Redemption

                      (3) that the holder is to surrender to the Company, in the
manner and at the place designated, its certificate or certificates representing
the shares of Preferred Stock to be redeemed.

                  (ii) On or before the Redemption Date, each holder of
         Preferred Stock shall surrender the certificate or certificates
         representing such shares of Preferred Stock to the Company, in the
         manner and at the place designated in the Redemption Notice, and
         thereupon the Redemption Price for such shares shall be payable in cash
         on the Redemption Date to the person whose name appears on such
         certificate or certificates as the owner thereof, and each surrendered
         certificate shall be cancelled and retired. In the event that less than
         all of the shares represented by any such certificate are redeemed, a
         new certificate shall be issued representing the unredeemed shares.

                  (c) Dividends on the Preferred Stock called for redemption
shall cease to accumulate on the Redemption Date, and the holders of such shares

         the holders of the Common Stock, on the one hand, and the Required
         Holders, on the other hand, nor by such Investment Banking Firms within
         30 days after the date of the delivery of the objection by Required
         Holders, then the specific matters in dispute shall be submitted to a

         the Company, the holders of the Common Stock and the Required Holders a
         confirmation of the Company Value, as determined by the Mutual
         Investment Banking Firm, and the Required Holders' Investment Banking
         Firm shall send a letter to the Company, the holders of the Common
         Stock and the Required Holders confirming that such confirmed or
         revised Company Value is in accordance with such determination,

         such parties.

                  (iv) The parties hereto shall cooperate with each other and
         each other's authorized representatives and with Mutual Investment

of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary, the assets to be distributed
among the holders of Preferred Stock, after distribution has been made to the
holders of the Series A Preferred Stock pursuant to the terms and provisions of
the Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Designation, shall be
insufficient to permit the payment to such stockholders of the full preferential

the holders of any preferred stock of the Company entitled to a preference over
the Common Stock in accordance with the terms thereof and, thereafter, to the
holders of Common Stock, Series A Preferred Stock and Preferred Stock, in

         5. Voting Rights. In addition to any voting rights provided by law
(which rights, except as may be prohibited by law, are subject to the provisions
for dilution and the limitations set forth in Section 5(a) hereof), the holders
of shares of Preferred Stock shall have the following voting rights:

                  (a) Subject to the provisions for dilution and the limitations
hereinafter set forth, so long as any of the Preferred Stock is outstanding,
each share of Preferred Stock shall entitle the holder thereof to vote on all
matters voted on by the holders of Common Stock, voting together as a single
class with other shares entitled to vote at all meetings of the stockholders of
the Company. The number of votes which a holder of Preferred Stock is entitled
to cast, as the same may be adjusted from time to time as hereinafter provided
(which adjustment is subject to the limitations set forth in this Section 5(a)),
is hereinafter referred to as the "Vote Multiple," which, as of the first of the
Original Issue Dates, will be equal to one per each share of Preferred Stock. In
the event the Company shall at any time after the first of the Original Issue
Dates declare or pay any dividend on Common Stock payable in shares of Common
Stock, or effect a subdivision or split or a combination, consolidation or
reverse split of the outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater or lesser
number of shares of Common Stock, or issue additional shares of Common Stock at
a purchase price which is less than the Appraised Value of such shares on the
date of issuance, then in each such case the Vote Multiple thereafter applicable
to the determination of the number of votes per share which holders of shares of
Preferred Stock are entitled to cast after such event shall be the Vote Multiple
immediately prior to such event multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which
is the number of shares of Common Stock, Series A Preferred Stock and Preferred
Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is
the number of shares of Common Stock, Series A Preferred Stock and Preferred
Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event. Notwithstanding the
foregoing or any other provision to the contrary set forth in the Certificate of
Incorporation or By-laws of the Company or this Certificate of Designation or in
any other document relating to the voting rights of the holders of the shares of
the Preferred Stock, the "Vote Multiple" applicable to the determination of the
number of votes per share which holders of shares of Preferred Stock are
entitled to cast shall at all times be adjusted to the extent necessary to
ensure that the holders of all shares of Preferred Stock and of all shares of
Series A Preferred Stock combined shall not be entitled to cast more than 49% of
the votes on any matter voted on by the holders of the shares of Common Stock,
the holders of Series A Preferred Stock and the holders of the shares of
Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class.

                  (b) The unanimous affirmative vote of all of the shares of
Preferred Stock, voting together as a class, in person or by proxy, at a special
or annual meeting of stockholders called for the purpose, or pursuant to a
written consent of stockholders shall be necessary to:


                                       C-9
<PAGE>


                  (i) authorize, adopt or approve an amendment to the
         Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws of the Company or an amendment
         to this Certificate of Designation that would have one of the following
         results: (A) reduce the stated value or Liquidation Preference of, or
         Dividend Rate on, the Preferred Stock, (B) change the place or currency
         of payment or stated value or Liquidation Preference of, or Dividend
         Rate on, the Preferred Stock, (C) impair the right to institute suit
         for the enforcement of any payment on or with respect to the Preferred
         Stock, or (D) reduce the percentage of outstanding shares of Preferred
         Stock necessary to modify or amend the terms hereof or to grant
         waivers;

                  (ii) issue any shares of the capital stock of the Company
         ranking senior to, or pari passu with (either as to dividends or upon
         voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up) the
         Preferred Stock, or issue any securities convertible into, or
         exchangeable for, such shares, except shares of Common Stock and shares
         of Series A Preferred Stock and Preferred Stock issued in lieu of cash
         dividends in accordance with the Second Amended Certificate of
         Designation and this Series B Certificate of Designation, respectively;
         or

                  (iii) take any action which would result in an Organic Change.

                  (c) The foregoing rights of holders of shares of Preferred
Stock to take any actions as provided in this Section 5 may be exercised at any
annual meeting of stockholders or at a special meeting of stockholders held for
such purpose as hereinafter provided or at any adjournment thereof or pursuant
to any written consent of stockholders. If the annual meeting of stockholders of
the Company is not, for any reason, held within the time fixed in the By-laws of
the Company, a proper officer of the Company, upon the written request of the
holders of record of at least ten percent (10%) of the shares of Preferred Stock
then outstanding, addressed to the Secretary of the Company, shall call a
special meeting in lieu of the annual meeting of stockholders or a special
meeting of the holders of Preferred Stock, for any appropriate purpose pursuant
to the DGCL of electing or, if necessary, removing directors. Any such meeting
shall be held at the earliest practicable date at the place for the holding of
the annual meetings of stockholders. If such meeting shall not be called by the
proper officer of the Company within twenty (20) days after personal service of
said written request upon the Secretary of the Company, or within twenty (20)
days after mailing the same within the United States by certified mail,
addressed to the Secretary of the Company at its principal executive offices,
then the holders of record of at least ten percent (10%) of the outstanding
shares of Preferred Stock may designate in writing one of their members to call
such meeting at the expense of the Company, and such meeting may be called by
the person so designated upon the notice required for the annual meetings of
stockholders of the Company and shall be held at the place for holding the
annual meetings of stockholders. Any holder of Preferred Stock so designated
shall have access to the lists of stockholders to be called pursuant to the
provisions hereof.

         6. Redemption of Preferred Stock.

                  (a) The Company may, at any time, redeem, and the holders of
the outstanding Preferred Stock shall sell to the Company, at the redemption
price equal to the sum


                                      C-10
<PAGE>


of the Liquidation Preference per share plus an amount equal to all accrued and
unpaid dividends per share (the "Redemption Price"), all or a portion of the
outstanding Preferred Stock.

                  (b) (i) At least thirty (30) days prior to the date fixed for
the redemption of the Preferred Stock, written notice (the "Redemption Notice")
shall be mailed, postage prepaid, to each holder of record of the Preferred
Stock at its post office address last shown on the records of the Company. The
Redemption Notice shall state:

                      (1) the number of shares of Preferred Stock held by the
holder that the Company intends to redeem;

                      (2) the date fixed for redemption and the Redemption
Price; and

                      (3) that the holder is to surrender to the Company, in the
manner and at the place designated, its certificate or certificates representing
the shares of Preferred Stock to be redeemed.

                  (ii) On or before the Redemption Date, each holder of
         Preferred Stock shall surrender the certificate or certificates
         representing such shares of Preferred Stock to the Company, in the
         manner and at the place designated in the Redemption Notice, and
         thereupon the Redemption Price for such shares shall be payable in cash
         on the Redemption Date to the person whose name appears on such
         certificate or certificates as the owner thereof, and each surrendered
         certificate shall be cancelled and retired. In the event that less than
         all of the shares represented by any such certificate are redeemed, a
         new certificate shall be issued representing the unredeemed shares.

                  (c) Dividends on the Preferred Stock called for redemption
shall cease to accumulate on the Redemption Date, and the holders of such shares
redeemed shall cease to have any further rights with respect thereto on the
Redemption Date.

                  (d) If, at the time of any redemption pursuant to this Section
6, the funds of the Company legally available for redemption of Preferred Stock
are insufficient to redeem the number of shares required to be redeemed, those
funds which are legally available shall be used to redeem the maximum possible
number of such shares, pro rata based upon the number of shares to be redeemed.
At any time thereafter when additional funds of the Company become legally
available for the redemption of Preferred Stock, such funds shall immediately be
used to redeem the balance of the shares of Preferred Stock which the Company
has become obligated to redeem pursuant to this subparagraph, but which it has
not redeemed.

                  (e) The Company may not otherwise redeem or repurchase the
Preferred Stock.

                  (f) The Company may not redeem or repurchase the Preferred
Stock unless it will also or has previously redeemed or repurchased the Series A
Preferred Stock.

         7. Certain Covenants. Any registered holder of Preferred Stock may
proceed to protect and enforce its rights and the rights of such holders by any
available remedy by proceeding at law or in equity to protect and enforce any
such rights, whether for the specific


                                      C-11
<PAGE>


enforcement of any provision in this Certificate of Designation or in aid of the
exercise of any power granted herein, or to enforce any other proper remedy.

         8. No Reissuance of Preferred Stock. No Preferred Stock acquired by the
Company by reason of redemption, purchase, or otherwise shall be reissued, and
all such shares shall be cancelled, retired and eliminated from the shares which
the Company shall be authorized to issue.

         9. Notices. All notices to the Company permitted hereunder shall be
personally delivered or sent by first class mail, postage prepaid, addressed to
its principal office located at 1675 Broadway, Suite 900, Denver, CO 80202 or to
such other address at which its principal office is located and as to which
notice thereof is similarly given to the holders of the Preferred Stock at their
addresses appearing on the books of the Company.

                         Re: Coram, Inc.

Ladies and Gentlemen:

                  Coram Healthcare Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("CHC")
and its subsidiary Coram, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), filed
for relief under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the United States Code, Sections 101,
et seq., in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (the
"Bankruptcy Court"), which cases are jointly administered under In re Coram
Healthcare Corporation, Case No. 00-3299 (MFW)(Jointly Administered). Arlin M.
Adams was appointed Chapter 11 Trustee for the Company and CHC (the "Trustee"),
which appointment was approved by the Bankruptcy Court on March 7, 2002.

                  We have acted as counsel for the Trustee in connection with
the transactions contemplated by the Exchange Agreement, dated as of December
31, 2002 (the "Exchange Agreement"), by and among the Company, Goldman Sachs
Credit Partners L.P., a Bermuda limited partnership ("Goldman"), Foothill
Capital Corporation, a California corporation ("Foothill"), and Cerberus
Partners L.P., a New York limited partnership ("Cerberus") (each of Goldman,
Foothill and Cerberus a "Holder" and, collectively, the "Holders").

                  Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have,
unless the context otherwise requires, the respective meanings assigned to them
in the Exchange Agreement.

                  For purposes of this opinion, we have examined, among other
things, the following documents, each dated as of the date hereof, unless
otherwise specified:

                  (i) executed counterparts of the Exchange Agreement;

                  (ii) the Second Certificate of Amendment of Certificate of
Designation of the Company filed with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware on December 31, 2002;

                  (iii) the Certificate of Designation for the Company for the
Series B Cumulative Preferred Stock filed with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware on December 31, 2002;

                  (iv) executed counterparts of the Stockholder Agreement, dated
as of December 29, 2000, by and among the Company and Foothill, Cerberus and
Goldman, Sachs & Co., a New York limited partnership, of Amendment No. 1
thereto, dated as of December 31, 2001, and of Amendment No. 2 thereto, dated as

                  (v) executed counterparts of the Amendment No. 6 to the
Securities Exchange Agreement, dated as of December 31, 2002, by and among the
Company, Coram Healthcare Corporation and the Holders;

                  (vi) executed counterparts of the Series B Senior Subordinated
Convertible Notes, dated as of December 31, 2002 (the "December 2002 Notes"), in
favor of the Holders;

                  (vii) copies certified as true and correct by an officer of
the Company of the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and the
Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Company, as amended as of the date hereof
(the "Charter Documents");

                  (viii) certificate of the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware attesting to, as of December 23, 2002, the legal existence and the good
standing of the Company in the State of Delaware (the "Certificate");

                  (ix) the Order, dated December 27, 2002, entered by the United
States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware;

                  (x) copy of the order of the Bankruptcy Court dated March 7,
2002, appointing Arlin M. Adams as Trustee; and

                  (xi) copies certified as true and correct by an officer of the
Company of resolutions by unanimous written consent of (a) the sole voting
stockholder of the Company, dated December 31, 2002, (b) the Trustee acting for
the sole voting stockholder of the Company, dated December 31, 2002, and (c) the
Trustee acting for the Company, dated December 31, 2002, in each case relating
to the issuance of the December 2002 Preferred Stock and related matters.

                  The documents, agreements and instruments referred to in
paragraphs (i), (ii), (iii) and (v) above and Amendment No. 2 to the Stockholder
Agreement are referred to herein as the "Transaction Documents."

                  In making such examination and in rendering the opinions set
forth below, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures (other than those
of the Company), the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals,
the conformity to original documents


                                      D-2

of all documents submitted to us as certified or photostat copies and the
authenticity of the originals of such latter documents.

                  We have assumed that each of the parties to the Transaction
Documents (other than the Company) has the power and authority and has taken the
action necessary to authorize the execution and delivery of, and the performance
of its obligations under, the Transaction Documents to which it is a party, that
such Transaction Documents have been validly executed and delivered by each such
party and are binding thereon, that no consent, approval, authorization,
declaration or filing by or with any governmental commission, board or agency,
which has not been obtained or made, is required for the valid execution or
delivery by such party of, or the performance of obligations under, the
Transaction Documents.

                  As to matters of fact, we have relied with your permission
upon the representations and warranties made by the Company in the Transaction
Documents and in certificates of public officials and of officers of the
Company, and we have assumed that such representations and warranties and
certificates are accurate, complete and valid as of the date hereof.

                  We have assumed with your permission that (i) the State of New
York is the principal place of business of each of Goldman and Cerberus, and
(ii) the State of California is the principal place of business of Foothill.

                  The law covered by the opinions expressed herein is limited to
the law of the State of New York, and the federal law of the United States, and,
in respect of the opinions set forth in paragraphs 1 through 5 below, the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.

                  Based upon the foregoing, and subject to the exceptions,
qualifications, limitations, assumptions and reliances stated herein, it is our
opinion that:

                  1. Based solely on the Certificate, the Company is validly
existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of
Delaware.

                  2. The Company has the corporate power and authority to (a)
execute and deliver, and perform its obligations under, the Transaction
Documents, and (b) execute and deliver the December 2002 Notes and issue the
December 2002 Preferred Stock in exchange for the Exchange Notes in connection
therewith. The execution and delivery by the Company of, and performance by the
Company of its obligations under, the Transaction Documents have been duly
authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company. The
exchange of the December 2001 Notes for the December 2002 Notes and the December
2002 Preferred Stock has been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action
on the part of the Company. Each of the Transaction Documents and the December
2002 Notes has been duly executed and delivered by the Company. Each of the
Transaction Documents constitutes the Company's legal, valid and binding
obligation enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms.

                  3. The execution and delivery by the Company of, and
performance by the Company of its obligations under, the Transaction Documents
do not (a) violate any provision of the Charter Documents or (b) violate any
statute, rule or regulation of any governmental authority of the United States
or the State of New York, or any provision of the General Corporation Law of the
State of Delaware, known to us to which the Company is subject.

                  4. The issuance, sale and delivery by the Company of the
December 2002 Preferred Stock have been duly authorized by all requisite
corporate action by the Company and, when sold and delivered in the manner
contemplated by the Exchange Agreement, will be duly and validly issued and
outstanding, fully paid and non-assessable and free of (i) limitations on voting
rights, options and other encumbrances, other than as specified in the
Transaction Documents and Charter Documents, and (ii) to our knowledge (and
without independent verification), any adverse claims.

                  5. No authorization, approval, or other action by, and no
notice to or filing with, any governmental authority, which has not been
obtained or made, is required for the execution and delivery by the Company of,
and performance by the Company of its obligations under, the Transaction
Documents (except for notice filings that may be required by applicable state
"blue sky" laws and federal securities laws).

                  6. Based upon the representations and warranties of the
Company and the Holders in the Transaction Documents with respect to factual
matters, it is not necessary in connection with the offer, sale and delivery of
the December 2002 Preferred Stock and the December 2002 Notes to the Holders
under the Exchange Agreement to register the December 2002 Preferred Stock and
the December 2002 Notes under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or under
any applicable state securities or "blue sky" laws (except for notice filings
that may be required by applicable state "blue sky" laws and federal securities
laws).

                  The opinions expressed herein are subject in all respect to
the following further qualifications, limitations and exclusions:

                  a. The opinions set forth in paragraph 2 above with respect to
enforceability are further subject to the effects of laws relating to fraudulent
conveyances, transfers and obligations, including, without limitation,
Bankruptcy Code Section 548, the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act and other laws
in pari materia. Moreover, provisions of the Transaction Documents that permit
the Holders to take action or make determinations, or to benefit from
indemnities and similar undertakings of the Company, may be subject to a
requirement that such action be taken or such determinations be made, and that
any action or inaction by any of the Holders that may give rise to a request for
payment under any such indemnity or similar undertaking be taken or not taken,
on a reasonable basis and in good faith. The foregoing opinions with respect to
enforceability are further qualified by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting creditor's rights
generally and by general principles of


                                      D-4

equity, public policy considerations, judicial discretion and general
requirements of good faith and fair dealing and commercial reasonableness
(regardless of whether such enforceability is a proceeding in equity or at law).

                  b. We express no opinion as to how the transaction
contemplated by the Transaction Documents (the "Transaction") may be
characterized or treated under the laws of the State of New York relating to
licensure of home care service agencies or by any governmental agency, including
without limitation the New York State Department of Health or the New York
Public Health Council, charged with the enforcement of such laws. We further
express no opinion as to the effect on the Company or its performance under the
Transaction Documents of any governmental agency's failure to approve a change
of ownership and/or control deemed to have resulted from the Transaction,
including without limitation the Company's continued indirect ownership of Coram
Healthcare Corporation of Greater New York, a New York corporation, and/or Coram
Healthcare Corporation of New York, a New York corporation.

                  c. The enforceability of provisions in the Transaction
Documents to the effect that terms may not be waived or modified except in
writing may be limited under certain circumstances, including, but not limited
to, principles of equity, whether applied by a court of law or equity.

                  d. We express no opinion as to any provisions in the
Transaction Documents relating to the availability of specific performance,
injunctive relief or any other equitable remedy, or concerning the
enforceability of any waiver of any defenses or rights, jurisdiction or release
of any party.

                  e. We express no opinion as to the enforceability of the
indemnification provisions contained in any of the Transaction Documents insofar
as said provisions contravene public policy or might require indemnification or
payments with respect to any litigation against a party to any of the
Transaction Documents determined adversely to the other party(ies) to such
litigation, or any loss, cost or expense arising out of an indemnified party's
gross negligence or willful misconduct or any violation by an indemnified party
of statutory duties, general principles of equity or public policy.

                  f. Except as expressly set forth in paragraphs 5 and 6 above,
no opinion is given as to the application of any securities laws.

                  g. Our opinions are issued as of the date hereof and are
limited to the laws now in effect as to which our opinions relate and facts and
circumstances in existence on the date hereof, and we assume no undertaking to
advise you of any changes in the opinions expressed herein as a result of any
change in any laws, facts or circumstances which may come to our attention after
the date hereof.

         Re:      Coram, Inc.

Ladies and Gentlemen:

I am the Executive Vice President and Interim General Counsel of Coram, Inc., a
Delaware corporation (the "Company"). I am rendering this opinion in connection

                                                                     Page 2 of 3


(vi) Amended and Restated Series B Senior Subordinated Convertible Note of even
date herewith issued by the Company in favor of Goldman in the principal amount
of $4,090,693; (vii) Amended and Restated Series B Senior Subordinated
Convertible Note of even date herewith issued by the Company in favor of
Foothill in the principal amount of $1,687,675; (viii) Amended and Restated
Series B Senior Subordinated Convertible Note of even date herewith issued by
the Company in favor of Cerberus in the principal amount of $3,221,632; and (ix)
material agreements to which the Company is bound and such other documents,
originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to me by the Company's
legal and financial advisors as necessary or advisable to examine as a basis for
the opinions hereinafter expressed.

The documents, agreements and instruments referred to in paragraphs (i) through
(ix) above are referred to herein as the "Transaction Documents."

Based on the foregoing, and subject to the exceptions and qualifications stated
herein, it is my opinion that:

         1. The Company is a validly existing corporation in good standing under
the laws of the State of Delaware.

         2. The Company has the corporate power and authority to execute,
deliver and perform its obligations under the Transaction Documents. The
execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Transaction Documents
have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action of the Company. Each
of the Transaction Documents has been duly executed and delivered by the Company
and constitutes the Company's legal, valid and binding obligation enforceable
against the Company in accordance with its terms.

         3. To the best of my knowledge, the execution, delivery and performance
by the Company of the Transaction Documents and the consummation of the
transactions therein contemplated will not result in a breach or violation of
any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under, or conflict
with any of the terms or provisions of any material agreements to which the
Company is a party or by which any of its subsidiaries are bound.

         4. The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the
Transaction Documents and the consummation of the transactions therein
contemplated will not violate any court order or government authority order to
which the Company is subject on the date hereof.

I express no opinion as to the effect or applicability of the Bankruptcy Code or
any order that may exist (now or in the future) in the proceedings relating to
the bankruptcy case of the Company or CHC as to any provision in the Transaction
Documents (or in any document or instrument, entered into in connection
therewith) including, but not limited to, any such prior provisions relating to
(1) the voting rights of the holders of the shares of Preferred Stock or (2) the
number of members or composition of the Board of Directors of the Company that
the holders of shares of the Preferred Stock have the right to elect.

I am licensed to practice law in the State of California, and my opinion is
limited accordingly.

This opinion may be relied upon by the addressees only in connection with the
transactions contemplated by the Exchange Agreement. This opinion is not to be
relied upon by the addressees for any other purpose, or relied upon by any other
person for any purpose, without my prior written consent.

Very truly yours,
