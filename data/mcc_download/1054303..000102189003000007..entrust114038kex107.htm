as in effect in the State of Colorado and such additional rights and remedies to
which a secured party is entitled under the laws in effect in any jurisdiction
where any rights and remedies hereunder may be asserted, including without

recognizes that, by reason of certain prohibitions contained in the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended, and applicable state securities laws, Lender may be
compelled, with respect to any sale of all or any part of the Collateral, to
limit purchasers to those who will agree, among other things, to acquire the
Collateral for their own account, for investment and not with a view to the
distribution or resale thereof. Pledgor acknowledges that any such private sales
may be at prices and on terms less favorable to Lender than those obtainable
through a public sale without such restrictions, and, notwithstanding such
circumstances, agrees that any such private sale shall be deemed to have been
made in a commercially reasonable manner and that Lender shall have no
obligation to engage in public sales and no obligation to delay the sale of any
Collateral for the period of time necessary to permit Pledgor to register such
Collateral for public sale. </FONT>

<U>Rights of Lender</U>. If an Event of Default shall occur and not be cured
within any applicable cure period, Lender shall have the right to receive any
and all cash dividends or distributions paid in respect of the Pledged
Securities and make application thereof to the Loan in accordance with the
Security Agreement of even date herewith between the Lender and Entrust
Mortgage. If an Event of Default shall occur and not be cured within any
applicable cure period, then all such Pledged Securities at Lender&#146;s option
shall be registered in the name of Lender or its nominee, and Lender or its
nominee may thereafter exercise (i) all voting and all corporate and other
rights pertaining to the Pledged Securities and (ii) any and all rights of
conversion, exchange, and subscription and any other rights, privileges or
options pertaining to such Pledged Securities as if it were the absolute owner
thereof (including, without limitation, the right to exchange at its discretion
any and all of the Pledged Securities upon the exercise by Lender of any right,
privilege or option pertaining to such Pledged Securities, and in connection
therewith, the right to deposit and deliver any and all of the Pledged
Securities with any committee, depository, transfer agent, registrar or other
designated agency upon such terms and conditions as it may determine), all
without liability except to account for property actually received by it, but
Lender shall have no duty to exercise any such right, privilege or option and
shall not be responsible for any failure to do so or delay in so doing. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.7
<U>Reimbursement of Lender</U>. Pledgor hereby agrees to reimburse Lender, on
demand and to the extent of the Pledged Securities, for all reasonable expenses
incurred by Lender in connection with the administration and enforcement of this
Pledge Agreement and agrees to indemnify Lender and hold Lender harmless from
and against any and all liability incurred by Lender hereunder or in connection
herewith, unless such liability shall have been determined by a final,
non-appealable order of a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted
solely from willful misconduct or gross negligence on the part of Lender. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.8
<U>Lender Appointed Attorney-in-Fact</U>. Except as otherwise provided herein,
Pledgor hereby appoints Lender the attorney-in-fact of Pledgor for the purposes
of carrying out the provisions of this Pledge Agreement or taking any action or
executing any instrument that Lender may deem necessary or advisable to
accomplish the purposes hereof, which appointment is irrevocable and coupled
with an interest. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Lender shall
have the right, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of
Default, with full power of substitution either in Lender&#146;s name or in the
name of Pledgor, to ask for, demand, sue for, collect, receive and give
acquittance for any and all monies due or to become due under or by virtue of
any Collateral, to endorse checks, drafts, orders and other instruments for the
payment of money payable to Pledgor constituting Collateral or any part thereof
or on account thereof and to give full discharge for the same, to settle,
compromise, prosecute or defend any action, claim or proceeding with respect
thereto, and to sell, assign, endorse, pledge, transfer and make any agreement
respecting, or otherwise deal with, the same; provided, however, that nothing
herein contained shall be construed as requiring or obligating Lender to make
any commitment or to make any inquiry as to the nature or sufficiency of any
payment received by Lender, or to present or file any claim or notice, or to
take any action with respect to the Collateral or any part thereof or the monies
due or to become due in respect thereof or any property covered thereby, and no
action taken by Lender or omitted to be taken with respect to the Collateral or
any part thereof shall give rise to any defense, counterclaim or offset in favor
of any of Pledgor or to any claim or action against Lender. </FONT></P>
