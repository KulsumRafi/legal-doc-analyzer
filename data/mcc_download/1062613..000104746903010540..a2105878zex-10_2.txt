          AMENDED AND RESTATED SUBSIDIARY GUARANTY, dated as of March 30, 1998
and amended and restated as of March 6, 2003 (as so amended and restated and as

from time to time, this "GUARANTY"), made by each of the undersigned (each, a
"GUARANTOR" and together with any other entity that becomes a party hereto
pursuant to Section 26 hereof, collectively, the "GUARANTORS"). Except as
otherwise defined herein, terms used herein and defined in the Credit Agreement

AGENT"), Wachovia Bank, N.A., as Documentation Agent (the "DOCUMENTATION
AGENT"), and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas (f/k/a Bankers Trust Company),
as Administrative Agent (the "ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT", and together with the
Lenders, the Syndication Agent, the Documentation Agent, each Letter of Credit
Issuer and the Collateral Agent, the "LENDER CREDITORS"), have entered into a
Credit Agreement, dated as of March 30, 1998 and amended and restated as of
March 6, 2003 (as so amended and restated and as the same may be further
amended, amended and restated, modified or supplemented from time to time, the
"CREDIT AGREEMENT"), providing for the continuation and/or making of Loans and
the issuance and/or continuation of Letters of Credit as contemplated therein;

          WHEREAS, the Borrower may from time to time be party to one or more
Interest Rate Agreements (each such Interest Rate Agreement with an Interest
Rate Creditor (as defined below), a "SECURED INTEREST RATE AGREEMENT") with
Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, in its individual capacity ("DBTCA"), any
Lender or a syndicate of financial institutions organized by DBTCA or such
Lender or an affiliate of DBTCA or such Lender (even if DBTCA or any such Lender
ceases to be a Lender under the Credit Agreement for any reason), and any
institution that participates therein, and in each case their subsequent assigns
(collectively, the "INTEREST RATE CREDITORS", and together with the Lender
Creditors, collectively, the "CREDITORS");

          WHEREAS, each Guarantor is a wholly-owned direct or indirect
Subsidiary of the Borrower;

          WHEREAS, the Guarantors have heretofore entered into a Subsidiary
Guaranty, dated as of March 30, 1998 (as amended, modified or supplemented to

<Page>

          WHEREAS, the Guarantors desire to amend and restate the Original
Subsidiary Guaranty in the form of this Guaranty;

          WHEREAS, it is a condition to the continuation and/or making of Loans
and the issuance and/or continuation of Letters of Credit under the Credit
Agreement that each Guarantor shall have executed and delivered this Guaranty;
and

          WHEREAS, each Guarantor will obtain benefits from the incurrence
and/or continuation of Loans by the Borrower and the issuance and/or
continuation of Letters of Credit for the account of the Borrower under the
Credit Agreement and the entering into of Interest Rate Agreements and,
accordingly, desires to execute this Guaranty in order to satisfy the conditions
described in the preceding paragraph and to induce the Lenders to continue
and/or make Loans to the Borrower, the Interest Rate Creditors to enter into
and/or maintain Secured Interest Rate Agreements and the respective Letter of
Credit Issuer(s) to issue and/or continue Letters of Credit for the account of
the Borrower;

          NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and other benefits
accruing to each Guarantor, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, each Guarantor hereby makes the following representations and
warranties to the Creditors and hereby covenants and agrees with each Creditor
as follows:

          1.     Each Guarantor irrevocably and unconditionally, and jointly and
severally, guarantees:

          (i)    to the Lender Creditors, the full and prompt payment when due
     (whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) of (a) the
     principal of and interest on the Notes issued by, and the Loans made to,
     the Borrower under the Credit Agreement and all reimbursement obligations
     and Unpaid Drawings with respect to Letters of Credit and (b) all other
     obligations (including obligations which, but for any automatic stay under
     Section 362(a) of the Bankruptcy Code, would become due) and liabilities
     owing by the Borrower to the Lender Creditors under the Credit Agreement
     and the other Credit Documents (including, without limitation, indemnities,
     Fees and interest thereon) now existing or hereafter incurred under,
     arising out of or in connection with the Credit Agreement or any other
     Credit Document and the due performance and compliance with the terms of
     the Credit Documents by the Borrower (all such principal, interest,
     liabilities and obligations, the "CREDIT DOCUMENT OBLIGATIONS"); and

          (ii)   to the Interest Rate Creditors, the full and prompt payment
     when due (whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) of
     all obligations (including obligations which, but for any automatic stay
     under Section 362(a) of the Bankruptcy Code, would become due) and
     liabilities owing by the

                                        2
<Page>

     Borrower under any Secured Interest Rate Agreement, whether now in
     existence or hereafter arising, and the due performance and compliance by
     the Borrower with all terms, conditions and agreements contained therein
     (all such obligations and liabilities, the "INTEREST RATE OBLIGATIONS", and
     the Interest Rate Obligations together with the Credit Document
     Obligations, collectively, the "GUARANTEED OBLIGATIONS").

Each Guarantor understands, agrees and confirms that the Creditors may enforce
this Guaranty up to the full amount of the Guaranteed Obligations against each
Guarantor without proceeding against the Borrower, any other Guarantor or any
security for the Guaranteed Obligations, or under any other guaranty covering
all or a portion of the Guaranteed Obligations. All payments by each Guarantor
under this Guaranty shall be made on the same basis as payments by the Borrower
under Sections 3.03 and 3.04 of the Credit Agreement.

          2.     Additionally, each Guarantor, jointly and severally,
unconditionally and irrevocably, guarantees the payment of any and all
Guaranteed Obligations to the Creditors whether or not due or payable by the
Borrower upon the occurrence in respect of the Borrower of any of the events
specified in Section 8.05 of the Credit Agreement, and unconditionally and
irrevocably, jointly and severally, promises to pay such Guaranteed Obligations
to the Creditors, on demand, in lawful money of the United States of America.

          3.     The liability of each Guarantor hereunder is exclusive and
independent of any security for or other guaranty of the indebtedness of the
Borrower whether executed by such Guarantor, any other Guarantor, any other
guarantor or by any other party, and the liability of each Guarantor hereunder
shall not be affected or impaired by (a) any direction as to application of
payment by the Borrower or by any other party, (b) any other continuing or other
guaranty, undertaking or maximum liability of a guarantor or of any other party
as to the indebtedness of the Borrower, (c) any payment on or in reduction of
any such other guaranty or undertaking, (d) any dissolution, termination or
increase, decrease or change in personnel by the Borrower or (e) any payment
made to any Creditor on the indebtedness which any Creditor repays to the
Borrower pursuant to court order in any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement,
moratorium or other debtor relief proceeding, and each Guarantor waives any
right to the deferral or modification of its obligations hereunder by reason of
any such proceeding.

          4.     The obligations of each Guarantor hereunder are independent of
the obligations of any other Guarantor, any other guarantor or the Borrower, and
a separate action or actions may be brought and prosecuted against each
Guarantor whether or not action is brought against any other Guarantor, any
other guarantor or the Borrower and whether or not any other Guarantor, any
other guarantor of the Borrower or the Borrower is joined in any such action or
actions.

                                        3
<Page>

          5.     Each Guarantor hereby waives notice of acceptance of this
Guaranty and notice of any liability to which it may apply, and waives
promptness, diligence, presentment, demand of payment, protest, notice of
dishonor or nonpayment of any such liabilities, suit or taking of other action
by the Administrative Agent or any other Creditor against, and any other notice
to, any party liable thereon (including such Guarantor or any other guarantor of
the Borrower).

          6.     Any Creditor may at any time and from time to time without the
consent of, or notice to, any Guarantor, without incurring responsibility to
such Guarantor, without impairing or releasing the obligations of such Guarantor
hereunder, upon or without any terms or conditions and in whole or in part:

          (i)    change the manner, place or terms of payment of, and/or change
     or extend the time of payment of, renew or alter, any of the Guaranteed
     Obligations, any security therefor, or any liability incurred directly or
     indirectly in respect thereof, and the guaranty herein made shall apply to
     the Guaranteed Obligations as so changed, extended, renewed or altered;

          (ii)   sell, exchange, release, surrender, realize upon or otherwise
     deal with in any manner and in any order any property by whomsoever at any
     time pledged or mortgaged to secure, or howsoever securing, the Guaranteed
     Obligations or any liabilities (including any of those hereunder) incurred
     directly or indirectly in respect thereof or hereof, and/or any offset
     thereagainst;

          (iii)  exercise or refrain from exercising any rights against the
     Borrower, any other guarantor or others or otherwise act or refrain from
     acting;

          (iv)   settle or compromise any of the Guaranteed Obligations, any
     security therefor or any liability (including any of those hereunder)
     incurred directly or indirectly in respect thereof or hereof, and may
     subordinate the payment of all or any part thereof to the payment of any
     liability (whether due or not) of the Borrower to creditors of the Borrower
     (other than the Creditors);

          (v)    apply any sums by whomsoever paid or howsoever realized to any
     liability or liabilities of the Borrower to the Creditors regardless of
     what liabilities of the Borrower remain unpaid;

          (vi)   consent to or waive any breach of, or any act, omission or
     default under, any of the Credit Documents, the Secured Interest Rate
     Agreements or any of the instruments or agreements referred to therein, or
     otherwise amend, modify or supplement any of the Credit Documents, the
     Secured Interest Rate Agreements or any of such other instruments or
     agreements; and/or

                                        4
<Page>

          (vii)  act or fail to act in any manner referred to in this Guaranty
     which may deprive such Guarantor of its right to subrogation against the
     Borrower to recover full indemnity for any payments made pursuant to this
     Guaranty.

          7.     No invalidity, irregularity or unenforceability of all or any
part of the Guaranteed Obligations or of any security therefor shall affect,
impair or be a defense to this Guaranty, and this Guaranty shall be primary,
absolute and unconditional notwithstanding the occurrence of any event or the
existence of any other circumstances which might constitute a legal or equitable
discharge of a surety or guarantor except payment in full of the Guaranteed
Obligations.

          8.     This Guaranty is a continuing one and all liabilities to which
it applies or may apply under the terms hereof shall be conclusively presumed to
have been created in reliance hereon. No failure or delay on the part of any
Creditor in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as
a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power
or privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies herein
expressly specified are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies
which any Creditor would otherwise have. No notice to or demand on any Guarantor
in any case shall entitle such Guarantor to any other further notice or demand
in similar or other circumstances or constitute a waiver of the rights of any
Creditor to any other or further action in any circumstances without notice or
demand. It is not necessary for any Creditor to inquire into the capacity or
powers of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or the officers, directors,
partners or agents acting or purporting to act on its behalf, and any
indebtedness made or created in reliance upon the professed exercise of such
powers shall be guaranteed hereunder.

          9.     Any indebtedness of the Borrower now or hereafter held by any
Guarantor is hereby subordinated to the indebtedness of the Borrower to the
Creditors; and such indebtedness of the Borrower to any Guarantor, if the
Collateral Agent so requests after an Event of Default (as hereinafter defined)
has occurred, shall be collected, enforced and received by such Guarantor as
trustee for the Creditors and be paid over to the Creditors on account of the
indebtedness of the Borrower to the Creditors, but without affecting or
impairing in any manner the liability of such Guarantor under the other
provisions of this Guaranty. Prior to the transfer by any Guarantor of any note
or negotiable instrument evidencing any indebtedness of the Borrower to such
Guarantor, such Guarantor shall mark such note or negotiable instrument with a
legend that the same is subject to this subordination.

          10.    (a)  Each Guarantor hereby waives any right (except as shall be
required by applicable statute and cannot be waived) to require the Creditors
to: (i) proceed against the Borrower, any other Guarantor, any other guarantor
of the Borrower or any other party; (ii) proceed against or exhaust any security
held from the Borrower, any other Guarantor, any other guarantor of the Borrower
or any other party; or (iii)

                                        5
<Page>

pursue any other remedy in the Creditors' power whatsoever. Each Guarantor
waives any defense based on or arising out of any defense of the Borrower, any
other Guarantor, any other guarantor of the Borrower or any other party other
than payment in full of the Guaranteed Obligations, including, without
limitation, any defense based on or arising out of the disability of the
Borrower, any other Guarantor, any other guarantor of the Borrower or any other
party, or the unenforceability of the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof
from any cause, or the cessation from any cause of the liability of the Borrower
other than payment in full of the Guaranteed Obligations. The Creditors may, at
their election, foreclose on any security held by the Administrative Agent, the
Collateral Agent or the other Creditors by one or more judicial or nonjudicial
sales, whether or not every aspect of any such sale is commercially reasonable
(to the extent such sale is permitted by applicable law), or exercise any other
right or remedy the Creditors may have against the Borrower or any other party,
or any security, without affecting or impairing in any way the liability of any
Guarantor hereunder, except to the extent the Guaranteed Obligations have been
paid in full. Each Guarantor waives any defense arising out of any such election
by the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and the other Creditors, even
though such election may operate to impair or extinguish any right of
reimbursement or subrogation or other right or remedy of such Guarantor against
the Borrower, any other Guarantor or any other party or any security.

        (b)    Each Guarantor waives all presentments, demands for performance,
protests and notices, including, without limitation, notices of nonperformance,
notices of protest, notices of dishonor, notices of acceptance of this Guaranty,
and notices of the existence, creation or incurring of new or additional
Indebtedness. Each Guarantor assumes all responsibility for being and keeping
itself informed of the Borrower's financial condition and assets, and of all
other circumstances bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of the Guaranteed
Obligations and the nature, scope and extent of the risks which any Guarantor
assumes and incurs hereunder, and agrees that the Creditors shall have no duty
to advise such Guarantor of information known to them regarding such
circumstances or risks.

        (c)    Until such time as the Guaranteed Obligations have been paid in
full in cash or Cash Equivalents, each Guarantor hereby waives all rights of
subrogation which it may at any time otherwise have as a result of this Guaranty
(whether contractual, under Section 509 of the Bankruptcy Code, or otherwise) to
the claims of the Creditors against the Borrower, any other Guarantor or any
other guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations and all contractual, statutory or
common law rights of reimbursement, contribution or indemnity from the Borrower
or any other Guarantor which it may at any time otherwise have as a result of
this Guaranty.

          11.    If and to the extent that any Guarantor makes any payment to
any Creditor or to any other Person pursuant to or in respect of this Guaranty,
any claim which such Guarantor may have against the Borrower by reason thereof
shall be subject and subordinate to the prior payment in full of the Guaranteed
Obligations to each

                                        6
<Page>

Creditor. Prior to the transfer by any Guarantor of any note or negotiable
instrument evidencing any indebtedness of the Borrower to such Guarantor, such
Guarantor shall mark such note or negotiable instrument with a legend that the
same is subject to this subordination.

          12.    Each Guarantor covenants and agrees that on and after the date
hereof and until the Total Commitment and all Secured Interest Rate Agreements
have been terminated, no Note or Letter of Credit remains outstanding and all
Guaranteed Obligations have been paid in full, such Guarantor shall take, or
will refrain from taking, as the case may be, all actions that are necessary to
be taken or not taken so that no violation of any provision, covenant or
agreement contained in Section 6 or 7 of the Credit Agreement, and so that no
Event of Default, is caused by the actions of such Guarantor or any of its
Subsidiaries.

          13.    Each Guarantor hereby jointly and severally agrees to pay, to
the extent not paid pursuant to Section 11.01 of the Credit Agreement, all
reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including, without limitation, the
reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) of each Creditor in connection
with the enforcement of this Guaranty and of the Administrative Agent in
connection with any amendment, waiver or consent relating to this Guaranty.

          14.    This Guaranty shall be binding upon each Guarantor and its
successors and assigns and shall inure to the benefit of the Creditors and their
successors and assigns to the extent permitted under the Credit Agreement.

          15.    Neither this Guaranty nor any provision hereof may be changed,
waived, discharged or terminated except with the written consent of the Required
Lenders (or to the extent required by Section 11.12 of the Credit Agreement,
with the written consent of each Lender) and each Guarantor affected thereby (it
being understood that the addition or release of any Guarantor hereunder shall
not constitute a change, waiver, discharge or termination affecting any
Guarantor other than the Guarantor so added or released), PROVIDED that (x) no
such change, waiver, modification or variance shall be made to this Section 15
without the consent of each Creditor affected thereby and (y) any change,
waiver, modification or variance affecting the rights and benefits of a single
Class (as defined below) of Creditors (and not all Creditors in a like or
similar manner) shall require the written consent of the Requisite Creditors (as
defined below) of such Class. For the purpose of this Guaranty, the term "CLASS"
shall mean each class of Creditors, i.e., whether (i) the Lender Creditors as
holders of the Credit Document Obligations or (ii) the Interest Rate Creditors
as holders of the Interest Rate Obligations. For the purpose of this Guaranty,
the term "REQUISITE CREDITORS" of any Class shall mean (i) with respect to the
Credit Document Obligations, the Required Lenders and (ii) with respect to the
Interest Rate Obligations, the holders of at least a majority of all obligations
outstanding from time to time under the Secured Interest Rate Agreements.

                                        7
<Page>

          16.    Each Guarantor acknowledges that an executed (or conformed)
copy of each of the Credit Documents and the Secured Interest Rate Agreements
has been made available to its principal executive officers and such officers
are familiar with the contents thereof.

          17.    In addition to any rights now or hereafter granted under
applicable law (including, without limitation, Section 151 of the New York
Debtor and Creditor Law) and not by way of limitation of any such rights, upon
the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default (such term
shall mean and include any "Event of Default" as defined in the Credit Agreement
or any payment default under any Secured Interest Rate Agreement continuing
after any applicable grace period), each Creditor is hereby authorized, at any
time or from time to time, without notice to any Guarantor or to any other
Person, any such notice being expressly waived, to set off and to appropriate
and apply any and all deposits (general or special) and any other indebtedness
at any time held or owing by such Creditor to or for the credit or the account
of any Guarantor, against and on account of the obligations and liabilities of
such Guarantor to such Creditor under this Guaranty, irrespective of whether or
not such Creditor shall have made any demand hereunder and although said
obligations, liabilities, deposits or claims, or any of them, shall be
contingent or unmatured. Each Creditor agrees to promptly notify the relevant
Guarantor after any such set off and application, PROVIDED that the failure to
give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set off and application.

          18.    All notices, requests, demands or other communications provided
for hereunder made in writing (including communications by facsimile
transmission) shall be deemed to have been duly given or made when delivered to
the Person to which such notice, request, demand or other communication is
required or permitted to be given or made under this Guaranty, addressed to such
party at (i) in the case of any Lender Creditor, as provided in the Credit
Agreement, (ii) in the case of each Guarantor, at its address set forth opposite
its signature below and (iii) in the case of any Interest Rate Creditor, at such
address as such Interest Rate Creditor shall have specified in writing to the
Guarantors; or in any case at such other address as any of the Persons listed
above may hereafter notify the others in writing.

          19.    If claim is ever made upon any Creditor for repayment or
recovery of any amount or amounts received in payment or on account of any of
the Guaranteed Obligations and any such Creditor repays all or part of said
amount by reason of (i) any judgment, decree or order of any court or
administrative body having jurisdiction over such Creditor or any of its
property or (ii) any settlement or compromise of any such claim effected by such
Creditor with any such claimant (including the Borrower), then and in such event
each Guarantor agrees that any such judgment, decree, order, settlement or
compromise shall be binding upon such Guarantor, notwithstanding any revocation
hereof or other instrument evidencing any liability of the Borrower, and each
Guarantor shall be and remain liable to such Creditor hereunder for the amount
so repaid

                                        8
<Page>

or recovered to the same extent as if such amount had never originally been
received by any such Creditor.

          20.    (a)  THIS GUARANTY AND THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE
CREDITORS AND OF THE UNDERSIGNED HEREUNDER SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WITHOUT REGARD TO PRINCIPLES OF
CONFLICT OF LAWS. Any legal action or proceeding with respect to this Guaranty
or any other Credit Document may be brought in the courts of the State of New
York or of the United States of America for the Southern District of New York,
and, by execution and delivery of this Guaranty, each Guarantor hereby
irrevocably accepts for itself and in respect of its property, generally and
unconditionally, the jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts. Each Guarantor
further irrevocably consents to the service of process out of any of the
aforementioned courts in any such action or proceeding by the mailing of copies
thereof by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, to each Guarantor at
its address set forth opposite its signature below, such service to become
effective 30 days after such mailing. Nothing herein shall affect the right of
any of the Creditors to serve process in any other manner permitted by law or to
commence legal proceedings or otherwise proceed against any Guarantor in any
other jurisdiction.

        (b)    Each Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives any objection which it
may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any of the aforesaid actions
or proceedings arising out of or in connection with this Guaranty or any other
Credit Document brought in the courts referred to in clause (a) above and hereby
further irrevocably waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any such court
that such action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an
inconvenient forum.

        (c)    Each Guarantor and each Creditor hereby irrevocably waive all
rights to a trial by jury in any action, proceeding or counterclaim arising out
of or relating to this Guaranty, the other Credit Documents or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby.

          21.    (a)  After the Termination Date (as defined below), this
Guaranty shall terminate (provided that all indemnities set forth herein shall
survive any such termination) and the Administrative Agent, at the request and
expense of the respective Guarantor, will execute and deliver to such Guarantor
a proper instrument or instruments acknowledging the satisfaction and
termination of this Guaranty as provided above. As used in this Guaranty,
"Termination Date" shall mean the date upon which the Total Commitment and all
Secured Interest Rate Agreements have been terminated, no Note or Letter of
Credit under the Credit Agreement is outstanding (and all Loans have been paid
in full) and all other Obligations (as defined in the Credit Agreement) have
been paid in full (other than arising from indemnities for which no request has
been made).

                                        9
<Page>

        (b)    In the event that all of the equity interests of one or more
Guarantors are sold or otherwise disposed of (including by way of the merger or
consolidation of such Guarantor with or into another Person) or liquidated, in
any such case in compliance with the requirements of Section 7.02 of the Credit
Agreement (or such sale or other disposition or liquidation has been approved in
writing by the Required Lenders (or all Lenders if required by Section 11.12 of
the Credit Agreement)), and the proceeds of such sale, disposition or
liquidation are applied, to the extent applicable, in accordance with the
provisions of the Credit Agreement, such Guarantor shall be released from this
Guaranty and this Guaranty shall, as to each such Guarantor or Guarantors,
terminate, and have no further force or effect (it being understood and agreed
that the sale of one or more Persons that own, directly or indirectly, all of
the capital stock, partnership interests or other equity interests of any
Guarantor shall be deemed to be a sale of such Guarantor for the purposes of
this Section 21(b)).

          22.    Each Guarantor, in addition to the subrogation rights it shall
have against the Borrower under applicable law as a result of any payment it
makes hereunder, shall also have a right of contribution against all other
Guarantors in respect of any such payment PRO RATA among same based on their
respective net fair values as enterprises, PROVIDED any such right of
contribution shall be subject and subordinate to the prior payment in full of
the Guaranteed Obligations (and such Guarantor's obligations in respect
thereof). It is the desire and intent of each Guarantor and the Creditors that
this Guaranty shall be enforced to the full extent permissible under the laws
and public policies applied in each jurisdiction in which enforcement is sought.
If and to the extent that the obligations of any Guarantor under this Guaranty
would, in the absence of this sentence, be adjudicated to be invalid or
unenforceable because of any applicable state or federal law relating to
fraudulent conveyances or transfers, then the amount of such Guarantor's
liability hereunder in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations shall be deemed to
be reduced AB INITIO to that maximum amount which would be permitted without
causing such Guarantor's obligations hereunder to be so invalidated.

          23.    The Creditors agree that this Guaranty may be enforced only by
the action of the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, in each case
acting upon the instructions of the Required Lenders and that no other Creditor
shall have any right individually to seek to enforce or to enforce this Guaranty
or to realize upon the security to be granted by the Pledge Agreement, it being
understood and agreed that such rights and remedies may be exercised by the
