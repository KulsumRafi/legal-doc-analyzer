<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><B>WHEREAS,</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Board") of the Company and the Board have authorized and approved the

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><B>WHEREAS,</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> the Company now desires to amend the Plan in order to prevent deferrals under the Salary Deferral Plan from reducing Company

SIZE=2><B>NOW, THEREFORE,</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> the Plan shall be amended as follows: </FONT></P>

Effective as of January&nbsp;1, 2003: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.
The following new definition of "Match Compensation" shall be added immediately following Section&nbsp;1.1(11)&nbsp;of the Plan: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.
The following new Section&nbsp;1.1(15A) shall be added immediately following Section&nbsp;1.1(15) of the Plan: </FONT></P>

each payroll period in which a Member's Deferred Compensation Contributions under the Retirement Savings Plan are limited as a result of the limitations contained
in section&nbsp;401(a)(17) and/or 402(g)&nbsp;of the Code, the Company shall withhold from such Member's Compensation for such payroll period and the Member shall defer hereunder the amount by
which such Member's Deferred Compensation Contributions to the Retirement Savings Plan are reduced solely because of the application of such limitations; provided, however, that any amount withheld
and deferred pursuant to this sentence shall be determined based upon the assumption that the Member's election with respect to the percentage rate of his Deferred Compensation Contributions under the
Retirement Savings Plan in effect during such payroll period is equal to the percentage rate of his Deferred Compensation Contributions in effect on the first day of the Plan Year in which such
payroll period occurs. For purposes of determining the amount of a Member's Compensation to be withheld and deferred under the preceding sentence (for each payroll period in which a Member's Deferred
Compensation Contributions under the Retirement Savings Plan are limited as described in the preceding sentence), the amount of the Member's Compensation shall be deemed to be the Member's Match
Compensation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the maximum amount that may be withheld and deferred for any payroll period shall be the amount of 80% of the Member's Compensation for such period." </FONT></P>

Section&nbsp;3.2 (a)&nbsp;of the Plan shall be deleted and the following shall be substituted therefor: </FONT></P>

Percentage") of such Member's Match Compensation for such month. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the Match Percentage and the Compensation Percentage for a particular month shall be determined
based on the formula used for determining the amount of Employer Matching Contributions under the Retirement Savings Plan for such month. For example, if the Retirement Savings Plan provides that the
Employer Matching Contributions for a month shall equal 100% of the Before-Tax Contributions that were made by a participant during such month that were not in excess of 6% of such
participant's compensation for such month, then the Match Percentage for such month shall equal 100%, and the Compensation Percentage for such month shall equal 6%." </FONT></P>
