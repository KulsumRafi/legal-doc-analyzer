                  July 31, 2002 (including the notes thereto, collectively the
                  "BALANCE SHEET"), the form of which shall be subject to

         (b)      The Purchase Price shall be adjusted by the Net Worth
                  Adjustment. The Net Worth Adjustment (which may be a positive
                  or negative number) will be equal to (i) the Company's

                  in connection with the consummation of the Contemplated
                  Transactions (including, without limitation, any and all
                  legal, accounting and other fees, all plan termination costs,
                  all broker costs, and all other costs of any nature incurred

         (c)      Following the final determination of any Net Worth Adjustment
                  and on the Closing Date (i) Buyer shall issue additional
                  shares of Buyer Stock equivalent to the value of the Net Worth
                  Adjustment if the Net Worth Adjustment is a positive number;
                  or (ii) withhold shares of Buyer Stock equivalent to the value
                  of the Net Worth Adjustment if the Net Worth Adjustment is a
                  negative number.

reservations, or limitations of any nature except, with respect to all such
properties and assets, (a) mortgages or security interests shown on the Balance
Sheet as securing specified liabilities or obligations, with respect to which no
default (or event that, with notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a
default) exists, (b) liens for current taxes not yet due, and (c) with respect

actually performed in the Ordinary Course of Business. Unless paid prior to the
Closing Date, the Accounts Receivable are or will be as of the Closing Date
current and collectible net of the respective reserves shown on the Balance
Sheet or on the accounting records of the Company as of the Closing Date (which
reserves are adequate and calculated consistent with past practice and, in the
case of the reserve as of the Closing Date, will not represent a material
adverse change in the composition of such Accounts Receivable in terms of
aging). Subject to such reserves, each of the Accounts Receivable either has
been or will be collected in full, without any set-off, within ninety days after
the day on which it first becomes due and payable. There is no contest, claim or
right of set-off, other than returns in the Ordinary Course of Business, under
any Contract with any obligor of an Accounts Receivable relating to the amount
or validity of such Accounts Receivable. Schedule 3.8 of the Disclosure Schedule
contains a complete and accurate list of all Accounts Receivable as of the date
of the Balance Sheet, which list sets forth the aging of such Accounts
Receivable.

         (a)      The Company has filed or caused to be filed (on a timely basis
                  since December 31, 1998) all Tax Returns that are or were
                  required to be filed by or with respect to any of them, either
                  separately or as a member of a group of corporations, pursuant
                  to applicable Legal Requirements. Sellers have delivered or
                  made available to Buyer copies of all such Tax Returns
                  relating to income or franchise taxes filed since December 31,

                  those Tax Returns or otherwise, or pursuant to any assessment
                  received by Sellers or the Company, except such Taxes, if any,
                  as are listed in Schedule 3.11 of the Disclosure Schedule and
                  are being contested in good faith and as to which adequate

                  provided in the Balance Sheet.

         (b)      The charges, accruals and reserves with respect to Taxes on
                  the respective books of the Company are adequate (determined
                  in accordance with GAAP) and are at least equal to the
                  Company's liability for Taxes. There exists no proposed tax
                  assessment against the Company except as disclosed in the
                  Balance Sheet or in Schedule 3.11 of the Disclosure Schedule.

         (c)      All Tax Returns filed by (or that include on a consolidated
                  basis) the Company are true, correct and complete. There is no
                  tax sharing agreement that will require any payment by the
                  Company after the date of this Agreement.

         3.12 No Material Adverse Change. Since December 31, 2001, there has not

each employee benefit plan subject to ERISA, maintained by the Company or to
which the Company contributes.

         (a)      ERISA Compliance. Each such employee benefit plan (and each
                  related trust, insurance contract, or fund) complies in form
                  and in operation in all material respects with the applicable
                  requirements of ERISA, the Code and other applicable laws.

         (b)      Reporting Compliance. All required reports and descriptions
                  have been filed or distributed appropriately with respect to
                  each such employee benefit plan.

                  contributions and employee salary reduction contributions),
                  which are due, have been paid to each such employee benefit
                  plan, which is an employee pension benefit plan (within the
                  meaning of Section 3 of ERISA). Each such plan meets the
                  requirements of a "qualified plan" under Code Sec. 401(a) and
                  has received a favorable determination letter from the

                  such employee benefit plan.

         (e)      No Prohibited Transactions. Neither any such employee benefit
                  plan, nor any trust created thereunder, nor any trustee or
                  administrator thereof, has engaged in a transaction which
                  might subject any of such plans, any such trust, or any
                  trustee or administrator thereof, or any party dealing with
                  such plans or any such trust, to the tax or penalty on
                  prohibited transactions imposed by Section 4975 of the Code,
                  or to a penalty imposed by Title I, Schedule 5 of ERISA.

         (f)      No Multi-Employer Plans. The Company has never contributed,
                  nor has it ever been required to contribute to any
                  multi-employer Plan, nor does the Company have any material

                  representations and warranties, (ii) evidencing the
                  performance by either Seller of, or the compliance by either

                  the satisfaction of any condition referred to in this Section

9.       TERMINATION

         9.1      Termination Events. This Agreement may, by notice given prior
to or at the Closing, be terminated:

         (a)      by either Buyer or Sellers if a material Breach of any
                  provision of this Agreement has been committed by the other
                  party and such Breach has not been waived;

         (b)      (i) by Buyer if any of the conditions in Section 7 has not
                  been satisfied as of the Closing Date or if satisfaction of
                  such a condition is or becomes impossible (other than through
                  the failure of Buyer to comply with its obligations under this
                  Agreement) and Buyer has not waived such condition on or
                  before the Closing Date; or (ii) by Sellers, if any of the
                  conditions in Section 8 has not been satisfied of the Closing
                  Date or if satisfaction of such a condition is or becomes
                  impossible (other than through the failure of Sellers to
                  comply with their obligations under this Agreement) and
                  Sellers have not waived such condition on or before the
                  Closing Date;

         (c)      by mutual consent of Buyer and Sellers; or

         (d)      by either Buyer or Sellers if the Closing has not occurred
                  (other than through the failure of any party seeking to
                  terminate this Agreement to comply fully with its obligations
                  under this Agreement) on or before September 30, 2002 or such
                  later date as the parties may agree upon.

         9.2 Effect of Termination. Each party's right of termination under
Section 9.1 is in addition to any other rights it may have under this Agreement
or otherwise, and the exercise of a right of termination will not be an election
of remedies. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 9.1, all
further obligations of the parties under this Agreement will terminate, except
that the obligations in Sections 11.1 and 11.3 will survive; provided, however,
that if this Agreement is terminated by a party because of the Breach of the
Agreement by the other party or because one or more of the conditions to the
terminating party's obligations under this Agreement is not satisfied as a
result of the other party's failure to comply with its obligations under this
Agreement, the terminating party's right to pursue all legal remedies will
survive such termination unimpaired.

10.      INDEMNIFICATION; REMEDIES

         10.1 Survival; Right of Indemnification Not Affected by Knowledge. All
representations, warranties, covenants, and obligations in this Agreement, the
Disclosure Schedule, the supplements to the Disclosure Schedule, the certificate
delivered pursuant to Section 2.4(a)(v), and any other certificate or document
delivered pursuant to this Agreement will survive the Closing. The right to
indemnification, payment of Damages or other remedy based on such
representations, warranties, covenants, and obligations will not be affected by
any investigation conducted with respect to, or any Knowledge acquired (or
capable of being acquired) at any time, whether before or after the execution
and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing Date, with respect to the accuracy
or inaccuracy of or compliance with, any such representation, warranty,
covenant, or obligation. The waiver of any condition based on the accuracy of
any representation or warranty, or on the performance of or compliance with any
covenant or obligation, will not affect the right to indemnification, payment of
Damages, or other remedy based on such representations, warranties, covenants,
and obligations.

         10.2 Indemnification and Payment of Damages by Sellers. Sellers shall
jointly and severally indemnify, defend and hold harmless Buyer, the Company,
and their respective Representatives, stockholders, controlling persons, and
affiliates (collectively, the "INDEMNIFIED PERSONS") for, and shall pay to the
Indemnified Persons the amount of, any loss, liability, claim, damage (including
incidental and consequential damages), expense (including costs of investigation
and defense and reasonable attorneys' and accountants' fees) or diminution of
value, whether or not involving a third-party claim (collectively, "DAMAGES"),
arising, directly or indirectly, from or in connection with:

                  delivered by Sellers pursuant to this Agreement;

         (b)      any Breach by Sellers of any covenant or obligation of Sellers
                  in this Agreement;

                  with either Sellers or the Company (or any Person acting on
                  their behalf) in connection with any of the Contemplated
                  Transactions;

         (d)      any claim by any Person for errors or omissions in the
                  performance of professional services rendered by the Company
                  or its Representatives prior to the Effective Date as an
                  insurance broker or agent;

         (e)      subject to Section 7.10, Proceedings pending or Threatened
                  prior to the Effective Date, whether disclosed or not;

                  subsequently written off as liabilities by the Company;

         (g)      any subsequent negative adjustment to the Tangible Net Worth
                  of the Company as of the Closing Date after the Net Worth
                  Adjustment has been made; and

         (h)      any claim rising out of or resulting from the ownership or use
                  of the Building.

The remedies provided in this Section 10.2 will not be exclusive of or limit any
other remedies that may be available to Buyer or the other Indemnified Persons.

         10.3 Indemnification and Payment of Damages by Buyer. Buyer will
indemnify, defend and hold harmless Sellers, and will pay to Sellers the amount
of any Damages arising, directly or indirectly, from or in connection with (a)
any Breach of any representation or warranty made by Buyer in this Agreement or
in any certificate delivered by Buyer pursuant to this Agreement, (b) any Breach
by Buyer of any covenant or obligation of Buyer in this Agreement, or (c) any
claim by any Person for brokerage or finder's fees or commissions or similar
payments based upon any agreement or understanding alleged to have been made by
such Person with Buyer (or any Person acting on its behalf) in connection with
any of the Contemplated Transactions.

         10.4 Time Limitations. If the Closing occurs, Sellers will have no

or warranty, or covenant or obligation to be performed and complied with prior
to the Closing Date, other than those in Sections 3.2, 3.3, 3.6, 3.11, 3.13, and
3.19, unless on or before the fourth anniversary of the Closing Date, Buyer
notifies Sellers of a claim specifying the factual basis of that claim in
reasonable detail to the extent then known by Buyer. A claim with respect to
Section 3.11 and 3.13 may be made at any time until thirty (30) days after the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (with extensions). A claim
with respect to Section 3.2, 3.3, 3.6, and 3.19, or a claim for indemnification
or reimbursement not based upon any representation or warranty or any covenant
or obligation to be performed and complied with prior to the Closing Date, may
be made at any time. If the Closing occurs, Buyer will have no liability (for
indemnification or otherwise) with respect to any representation or warranty, or
covenant or obligation to be performed and complied with prior to the Closing
Date, other than Sections 4.2 and 4.6, unless on or before the fourth
anniversary of the Closing Date, Sellers notify Buyer of a claim specifying the
factual basis of that claim in reasonable detail to the extent then known by
Sellers. A claim with respect to Sections 4.2 and 4.6, or a claim for
indemnification over reimbursement not based on any representation or warranty
or covenant or obligation to be performed or complied with prior to the Closing

         10.5     Procedure for Indemnification - Third Party Claims.

         (a)      Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under Section
                  10.2 or Section 10.3 of notice of the commencement of any
                  Proceeding against it, such indemnified party will, if a claim
                  is to be made against an indemnifying party under such
                  Section, give notice to the indemnifying party of the
                  commencement of such claim, but the failure to notify the
                  indemnifying party will not relieve the indemnifying party of
                  any liability that it may have to any indemnified party,
                  except to the extent that the indemnifying party demonstrates
                  that the defense of such action is prejudiced by the
                  indemnifying party's failure to give such notice.

         (b)      If any Proceeding referred to in Section 10.5(a) is brought
                  against an indemnified party and it gives notice to the
                  indemnifying party of the commencement of such Proceeding, the
                  indemnifying party will, unless the claim involves Taxes, be
                  entitled to participate in such Proceeding and, to the extent
                  that it wishes (unless (i) the indemnifying party is also a
                  party to such Proceeding and the indemnified party determines
                  in good faith that joint representation would be
                  inappropriate, or (ii) the indemnifying party fails to provide
                  reasonable assurance to the indemnified party of its financial
                  capacity to defend such Proceeding and provide indemnification
                  with respect to such Proceeding), to assume the defense of
                  such Proceeding with counsel satisfactory to the indemnified
                  party and, after notice from the indemnifying party to the
                  indemnified party of its election to assume the defense of
                  such Proceeding, the indemnifying party will not, as long as
                  it diligently conducts such defense, be liable to the
                  indemnified party under this Section 10 for any fees of other
                  counsel or any other expenses with respect to the defense of
                  such Proceeding, in each case subsequently incurred by the
                  indemnified party in connection with the defense of such
                  Proceeding, other than reasonable costs of investigation. If
                  the indemnifying party assumes the defense of a Proceeding,
                  (i) it will be conclusively established for purposes of this
                  Agreement that the claims made in that Proceeding are within
                  the scope of and subject to indemnification; (ii) no
                  compromise or settlement of such claims may be effected by the
                  indemnifying party without the indemnified party's consent
                  unless (A) there is no finding or admission of any violation
                  of Legal Requirements or any violation of the rights of any
                  Person and no effect on any other claims that may be made
                  against the indemnified party, and (B) the sole relief
                  provided is monetary damages that are paid in full by the
                  indemnifying party; and (iii) the indemnified party will have
                  no liability with respect to any compromise or settlement of
                  such claims effected without its consent. If notice is given
                  to an indemnifying party of the commencement of any Proceeding
                  and the indemnifying party does not, within ten days after the
                  indemnified party's notice is given, give notice to the
                  indemnified party of its election to assume the defense of
                  such Proceeding, the indemnifying party will be bound by any
                  determination made in such Proceeding or any compromise or
                  settlement effected by the indemnified party.

         (c)      Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an indemnified party
                  determines in good faith that there is a reasonable
                  probability that a Proceeding may adversely affect it or its
                  affiliates other than as a result of monetary damages for
                  which it would be entitled to indemnification under this
                  Agreement, the indemnified party may, by notice to the
                  indemnifying party, assume the exclusive right to defend,
                  compromise, or settle such Proceeding, but the indemnifying
                  party will not be bound by any determination of a Proceeding
                  so defended or any compromise or settlement effected without
                  its consent (which may not be unreasonably withheld).

         (d)      Sellers and Buyer hereby consent to the non-exclusive
                  jurisdiction of any court in which a Proceeding is brought
                  against any Indemnified Person for purposes of any claim that
                  an Indemnified Person may have under this Agreement with
                  respect to such Proceeding or the matters alleged therein, and
                  agree that process may be served on Sellers with respect to
                  such a claim anywhere in the world.

         10.6 Procedure for Indemnification - Other Claims. A claim for
indemnification for any matter not involving a third-party claim may be asserted
by notice to the party from whom indemnification is sought.

         10.7 Limits on Indemnification. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement:

         (a) no amount shall be payable by an indemnifying party pursuant to
Section 10.2 or Section 10.3 unless the aggregate amount of all claims for
Damages that are indemnifiable pursuant to Section 10.2 or Section 10.3, as
applicable, exceeds Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000.00); provided, however, that
if claims in excess of such threshold are received by an indemnifying party, the
indemnifying party shall indemnify for the total amount of such claims;
provided, further, that the above minimum threshold shall not apply to claims
for Damages arising out of, resulting from or incident to breaches by Sellers of
their representations and warranties set forth in Sections 3.2, 3.3, 3.6 or
3.11, or by Buyer of its representations and warranties set forth in Sections
4.2 or 4.6, which breaches shall be indemnified against in their entity; and

         (b) the maximum aggregate amount of Damages for which indemnity may be
recovered from Sellers or from Buyer pursuant to this Article 10 shall be an
amount equal to the Purchase Price;

         10.8 Other Limitations on Indemnifications. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, no party hereto shall be required
to indemnify or hold harmless any other party hereto or otherwise compensate any
other party hereto for Damages with respect to mental or emotional distress,
exemplary, consequential, special or punitive damages.

         11.5 Further Assurances. The parties agree (a) to furnish upon request
to each other such further information, (b) to execute and deliver to each other
such other documents, and (c) do such other acts and things, all as the other
party may reasonably request for the purpose of carrying out the intent of this
Agreement and the documents referred to in this Agreement.

         11.6 Waiver. The rights and remedies of the parties to this Agreement
are cumulative and not alternative. Neither the failure nor any delay by any
party in exercising any right, power, or privilege under this Agreement or the
documents referred to in this Agreement will operate as a waiver of such right,
power, or privilege, and no single or partial exercise of any such right, power,
or privilege will preclude any other or further exercise of such right, power,
or privilege or the exercise of any other right, power, or privilege. To the
maximum extent permitted by applicable law, (a) no claim or right arising out of
this Agreement or the documents referred to in this Agreement can be discharged
by one party, in whole or in part, by a waiver or renunciation of the claim or
right unless in writing signed by the other party; (b) no waiver that may be
given by a party will be applicable except in the specific instance for which it
is given; and (c) no notice to or demand on one party will be deemed to be a
waiver of any obligation of such party or of the right of the party giving such
notice or demand to take further action without notice or demand as provided in
this Agreement or the documents referred to in this Agreement.

         11.7 Nonsolicitation Covenant. Each of the Sellers, by signature
hereto, covenants that he shall not for a period of three (3) years after the
Effective Date, directly or indirectly, except on behalf of Buyer, its
successors or assigns, solicit or accept risk management, insurance or bond
business from any of the customers of the Company as of the moment immediately
preceding the Effective Date. Each of the Sellers, by signature hereto,
acknowledges: (i) that his covenant is ancillary to this Agreement, is integral
hereto and is independent of any other provision herein, (ii) that this covenant
is reasonably necessary for the protection of Buyer's legitimate business
interests; (iii) that this covenant poses no undue hardship on the Sellers and
is reasonably limited as to duration and scope; and (iv) that this covenant is
in addition to any covenants which Sellers may make in any employment or other
agreements executed or to be executed with Buyer. Further, if any part of this
covenant is deemed overbroad or void as against public policy, each of the
Sellers, by signature hereto, acknowledges that such invalid portions shall be
severable from this covenant and specifically requests that, upon such event,
this covenant be reformed ("blue-penciled") to permit Buyer to obtain the
maximum permissible benefit from this covenant.

         11.8 Entire Agreement and Modification. This Agreement supersedes all
prior agreements between the parties with respect to its subject matter and
constitutes (along with the documents referred to in this Agreement) a complete
and exclusive statement of the terms of the agreement between the parties with
respect to its subject matter. This Agreement may not be amended except by a
written agreement executed by the party to be charged with the amendment.

         11.9 Disclosure Schedule.

Page 34

         (a)      The disclosures in the Disclosure Schedule, and those in any
                  supplement thereto, must relate only to the representations
                  and warranties in the Section of the Agreement to which they
                  expressly relate and not to any other representation or
                  warranty in this Agreement.

         (b)      In the event of any inconsistency between the statements in
                  the body of this Agreement and those in the Disclosure
                  Schedule (other than an exception expressly set forth as such
                  in the Disclosure Schedule with respect to a specifically
                  identified representation or warranty), the statements in the
                  body of this Agreement will control.

         11.10 Assignments, Successors and No Third-Party Rights. Neither party
may assign any of its rights under this Agreement without the prior consent of
the other parties except that Buyer may assign any of its rights under this
Agreement to any Subsidiary of Buyer. Subject to the preceding sentence, this
Agreement will apply to, be binding in all respects upon, and inure to the
benefit of the successors and permitted assigns of the parties. Nothing
expressed or referred to in this Agreement will be construed to give any Person
other than the parties to this Agreement any legal or equitable right, remedy,
or claim under or with respect to this Agreement or any provision of this
Agreement. This Agreement and all of its provisions and conditions are for the
sole and exclusive benefit of the parties to this Agreement and their successors
and assigns.

         11.11 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid
or unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, the other provisions of
this Agreement will remain in full force and effect. Any provision of this
Agreement held invalid or unenforceable only in part or degree will remain in
full force and effect to the extent not held invalid or unenforceable.

         11.12 Section Headings, Construction. The headings of Sections in this
Agreement are provided for convenience only and will not affect its construction
or interpretation. All references to "Section" or "Sections" refer to the
corresponding Section or Sections of this Agreement. All words used in this
Agreement will be construed to be of such gender or number, as the circumstances
require. Unless otherwise expressly provided, the word "including" does not
limit the preceding words or terms. The parties hereto have participated jointly
in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event of any ambiguity
or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be
construed as if drafted jointly by the parties and no presumption or burden of
proof shall arise favoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any of the
provisions of this Agreement.

         11.13 Time of Essence. With regard to all dates and time periods set
forth or referred to in this Agreement, time is of the essence.

         11.14 Governing Law. This Agreement will be governed by the laws of the
State of Ohio without regard to conflicts of laws principles.

         11.15    Jurisdiction, Waiver of Jury Trial.

         (a)      The parties hereto hereby irrevocably submit to the
                  jurisdiction of the courts of the sitting in Trumbull County,
                  Ohio and the federal courts of the United States of America
                  located in the Northern District of Ohio.

         (b)      EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY
                  CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO
                  INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH
                  SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY
                  RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY
                  LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING
                  TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS
                  AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO
                  REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS
                  REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY
                  WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE
                  FOREGOING WAIVER, (II) EACH SUCH

                  PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS
                  WAIVER, AND (III) EACH SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER
                  INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS
                  AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 11.15.

         11.16 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
