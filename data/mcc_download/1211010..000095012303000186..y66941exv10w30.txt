Dear Sirs:

     The purpose of this letter is to serve as a clarification of the above
described Sublease regarding the parties' obligation for real estate taxes. From
the date of Sublessee's possession and throughout the term of the Sublease, the
responsibility for payment of the real estate taxes for which the premises are
subject shall be the sole responsibility of Sublessee. Sublessor shall forward
copies of the real estate tax bills and Sublessee shall pay same directly to the
taxing authority prior to any interest or penalties accruing. Sublessee shall
provide Sublessor with proof of timely payment of the taxes. In the event
Sublessee fails to pay said taxes, Sublessor may, but shall not have the
obligation to, pay said taxes and charge them to Sublessee as rent. Failure of
Sublessee to pay said taxes in a timely manner shall constitute a material
default of the Sublease and Sublessor shall be provided with the remedies upon
default contained in the Sublease. The taxes shall be allocated on a prorata
basis at the beginning and end of the Sublease term.

     The terms contained in this letter agreement shall control over
inconsistencies or conflicts with the Sublease.

changes to said underlying Lease that affect Sublessee's rights hereunder.

5.   MAINTENANCE AND REPAIRS.  The Sublessee shall maintain and repair as
necessary, the interior and the exterior of the building including the roof

<PAGE>
The Sublessee shall keep and not misuse the premises so that they may be
returned to the Sublessor in as good an order and condition as when delivered to
Sublessee, excepting ordinary wear and tear, damage by fire, vandalism, the
elements and casualty, and damage due to any cause or happening not occasioned
by the negligence of the Sublessee. The Sublessee shall maintain, repair and
replace as necessary the plumbing, heating, ventilating and air conditioning
equipment, lighting and other electrical and mechanical equipment, sprinkler
system, elevators, glass, damage by vandals, and make all other repairs and
replacements including termite damage. The Sublessee shall also maintain, repair
and replace as necessary, the improvements and the lands which are a part of and
used in connection with the premises, including but not limited to ditches,
drains, sewers, utility lines, driveways, sidewalks, parking areas, lighting,
landscaping and fencing subject to the terms and provisions of Paragraph
Twenty-Four. If Sublessee shall fail to perform the repairs and maintenance set
forth above, Sublessor may elect to have such repair or maintenance performed at
its expense and seek reimbursement from the Sublessee. In such event Sublessee
shall also be liable to Sublessor for interest on such reimbursement amounts at
the highest interest rate allowable by law for the period commencing with
Sublessor's payment of such cost up to the date of its receipt of reimbursement
from Sublessee. In addition, if Sublessor shall commence a legal action against
Sublessee to obtain such reimbursement, Sublessee shall be liable to Sublessor
for all incidental costs incurred by Sublessor in conducting such legal action
including but not limited to court costs and reasonable legal fees incurred.

Anything to the contrary notwithstanding, Sublessor warrants the structural
integrity of the building and any structural fault which requires repair or
replacement (excepting the roof for which repair and replacement is as provided
for above) shall be the responsibility of and shall be paid by the Sublessor.

6.   EASEMENTS.  The enjoyment and use of all entrances, exits, approaches and
means of entrance and approach, and of light and air now existing in favor of
the demised Premises shall not be interfered with or interrupted by any act or
asset of the Sublessor during the term of this Sublease.

7.   ASSIGNMENT.  The Sublessee will not assign this Sublease without the
written consent of the Sublessor.

8.   NEGATIVE COVENANTS.  The Sublessee will not consent to any use of the
demised premises which shall be contrary to any valid ordinance or bylaw of any
municipality governing the Premises.

9.   CONDITION OF PREMISES.  Sublessee acknowledges that it has inspected the
Premises and agrees to enter into this Sublease Agreement and take possession of
the Premises in its "as is" condition, except as otherwise provided in Section 5
hereof. Sublessor makes no warranties or representations as to the condition of
the Premises, except as otherwise provided in Section 5 hereof.


[7901]                                                                    Page 2

11.  DESTRUCTION OF PREMISES. If the Premises shall be damaged by fire, the
elements, casualty, war, insurrection, riot, public disorder, act, authorized

happening as to be substantially destroyed, then this Sublease shall cease and
come to an end, and any unearned rent paid in advance by the Sublessee shall be
refunded to it.

In the case of only partial damage or destruction of the Premises or of other
portions of the building or buildings containing the Premises, then said
Premises or other portions of said building or buildings may be restored by the
Sublessor to their previous condition and a just proportion of the rent herein
reserved, according to the extent to which they have been rendered
untenantable, shall abate until the said Premises shall have been so restored
and put in proper condition for use and occupancy, and a just proportion of any
rent paid in advance by the Sublessee shall be refunded to it. Nonetheless, in
the event of such partial damage or destruction of the Premises, Sublessor may
elect to terminate this Lease upon five (5) days notice to Sublessee.

The Sublessor shall maintain fire and supplemental perils insurance coverage in
an amount sufficient to comply with the aforementioned provisions of this
Agreement.

If any authority having jurisdiction shall decide that the said building or
buildings should be demolished and removed, then forthwith upon such decision
being made and upon the Sublessee vacating the Premises, this Sublease shall
cease and come to an end and any unearned rent paid in advance by the Sublessee
shall be refunded to it.

12.  UNLAWFUL OCCUPATION. The Sublessor represents that the Premises may be used
for the purposes for which they are hereby leased and in the event of the
enactment or existence of any law, ordinance, rule, ruling, regulation, covenant
or restriction prohibiting or limiting the use of said Premises for any one or
more of the purposes for which they are hereby leased, then in that event at the
option of the Sublessee, this Sublease shall terminate and all liability
hereunder shall cease from and after the date such prohibition becomes
effective, and any unearned rent paid in advance by the Sublessee shall be
refunded to it.

13. RIGHTS UPON DEFAULT. If the Sublessee shall neglect or fail to perform or
observe any of the covenants contained herein on its part to be observed and
performed for thirty (30) days after written notice by the Sublessor, or if the
Sublessee shall be adjudicated bankrupt or insolvent according to law, or shall
make an assignment for the benefit of creditors, then and in any of said cases
the Sublessor may lawfully enter into and upon the said Premises or any part
thereof in the name of the whole, and repossess the same as of the former estate
of the

[7901]                                                                    Page 3

Sublessor and expel the Sublessee and those claiming under and through it and
remove its effects (forcibly if necessary), without being deemed guilty of any
manner of trespass, and without prejudice to any remedies which might otherwise
be used for arrears of rent or preceding breach of covenant and upon entry as

of such termination it will indemnify the Sublessor against all unavoidable loss
of rent which the Sublessor may incur by reason of such termination during the
residue of the term above specified.

without notice being required from either party; (b) in the event that the
Sublessee, any assignee, or sub-sublessee remains beyond the expiration date of
the term herein, it is the intention of the parties and it is hereby agreed that
a tenancy from month to month shall arise upon all the same terms and conditions
contained herein.

15. QUIET POSSESSION.  Sublessor hereby covenants that Sublessee on paying the
rent and performing all and singular the covenants and conditions of this
Sublease on its part to be performed, shall and may peaceably and quietly have,
hold and enjoy the demised premises for the term aforesaid, and for the term of
any renewal or renewals hereof, free from molestation, eviction or destruction
by the Sublessor, or by any other person or persons lawfully claiming the same.
