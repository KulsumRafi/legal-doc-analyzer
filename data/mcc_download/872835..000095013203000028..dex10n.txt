control of the Company of a nature that would be required to be reported in
response to Item 6(e) of Schedule 14A of Regulation 14A promulgated under the
Exchange Act, or any successor thereto, whether or not the Company is registered
under the Exchange Act; provided that, without limitation, such a change in
control shall be deemed to have occurred if (i) any "person" (as such term is
used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act) is or becomes the
"beneficial owner" (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act), directly

combined voting power of the Company's then outstanding securities; or (ii)
during any period of two consecutive years, individuals who at the beginning of
such period constitute the Board of Directors of the Company cease for any

which, in the opinion of the Committee, permanently prevents an employee from
satisfactorily performing the employee's usual duties for the Employer. The

of age sixty-five (65).

     2.17       Target Retirement Percentage. "Target Retirement Percentage"
means the percentage of Final Average Compensation which will be used as a

(4) decimal places.

     3.1        Eligibility and Participation.

                (a)     Eligibility. Eligibility to participate in the Plan
     shall be limited to those employees of the Employer who are designated by
     the Board.

                (b)     Participation. An Employee's participation in the Plan
     shall be effective upon notification of the employee of his status as a
     Participant by the Committee. Participation in the Plan shall continue
     until such time as the Participant terminates employment with the Employer,
     and as long thereafter as the Participant is eligible to receive benefits
     under this Plan.

     3.2        Change in Employment Status. If the Board determines that a
Participant's employment performance is no longer at a level which deserves
reward through participation in this Plan, but does not terminate the
Participant's employment with the Employer, participation herein and eligibility
to receive benefits hereunder shall be limited to the Participant's vested
interest in such benefits as of the date designated by the Board.

     3.3        Vesting. Each Participant shall be one hundred percent (100%)
vested in all benefits that are accrued for his benefit under this Plan as of
the date(s) of such accrual(s). For

<PAGE>

example, when a Participant satisfies the criteria to be eligible for Early
Retirement, he shall be 100% vested in his Early Retirement Benefit.

                                   ARTICLE IV

                         PRE-RETIREMENT SURVIVOR BENEFIT

     4.1        Pre-Retirement Survivor Benefit. If a Participant dies while
employed by the Employer, the Employer shall pay a supplemental survivor benefit
to the Participant's Beneficiary(ies). The amount of this benefit shall be equal
to the present value of the accrued Supplemental Retirement Benefit. Present
value shall be calculated using a discount rate equal to five percent (5%)
simple interest per annum.

     4.2        Payment of Benefits.

                (a)     Form and Commencement of Benefit Payments. The
     supplemental survivor benefits payable under this Article shall be paid in
     the form of one lump sum paid as soon as administratively possible.

                (b)     Commutation of Benefits. The Committee may, in its sole
     discretion and at any time upon the request of a Beneficiary, provide for
     payment of the actuarial equivalent of the supplemental survivor benefit at
     such times and in such forms as it deems appropriate.

                                    ARTICLE V

                        SUPPLEMENTAL RETIREMENT BENEFITS

     5.1        Normal Retirement Benefit. If a Participant retires on the
Normal Retirement Date, the Employer shall pay to the Participant an annual
Supplemental Retirement Benefit equal to the Target Retirement Percentage
multiplied by the Participant's Final Average Compensation, with the annual
Supplemental Retirement Benefit to be paid for ten (10) years as set forth in
Section 5.5(a).

     5.2        Deferred Retirement Benefit. If a Participant retires at a
Deferred Retirement Date, the Employer shall pay to the Participant an annual
Supplemental Retirement Benefit equal to the Target Retirement Percentage
multiplied by the Participant's Final Average Compensation, with the annual
Supplemental Retirement Benefit to be paid for ten (10) years as set forth in
Section 5.5(a).

     5.3        Early Retirement Benefit. If a Participant retires at an Early
Retirement Date, the Employer shall pay to the Participant an annual
Supplemental Retirement Benefit equal to the Target Retirement Percentage
multiplied by the Participant's Final Average Compensation, subject to
adjustment as set forth below, with the annual Supplemental Retirement Benefit
to be

                                        7

<PAGE>

paid for ten (10) years as set forth in Section 5.5(a). Unless the Participant
has twenty (20) Years of Service or terminates his employment with the Employer
within twenty four (24) months following a Change in Control, the above Early
Retirement Benefit shall be reduced by three and one-third percent (3.3333%) for
each year by which the benefit commencement date precedes the Participant's
sixty-fifth (65th) birthday. This percentage shall be prorated for partial
years.

     5.4        Disability Retirement Benefit. If a person terminates employment
prior to Retirement as a result of Disability, the Employer shall pay to the
Participant an annual Supplemental Retirement Benefit commencing on the date
specified in Section 5.5(b) equal to the amount the Participant would have
received at such time under the Normal Retirement provisions of this Article.
For purposes of this calculation, Years of Credited Service shall continue to
accrue during the period of Disability and the Participant's Final Average
Compensation shall be based only on the amounts earned during the twelve (12)
months prior to Disability if this provides the Participant with a greater
benefit.

     5.5        Payment of Benefits.

                (a)     Form of Benefit Payments. Supplemental Retirement
     Benefits paid under this Plan shall be paid in the form of a ten (10) year
     annuity. If a Participant dies prior to the completion of the ten (10) year
     payment period, any remaining payments will be made to the Participant's
     Beneficiary.

                (b)     Commencement of Benefit Payments. The Supplemental
     Retirement Benefits payable to a Participant under the Normal, Deferred or
     Early Retirement provisions of this Article shall commence on the January
     first (lst) following the Participant's termination of employment. The
     Supplemental Retirement Benefits payable to a Participant under the
     Disability provisions of this Article shall commence on the January first
     (lst) following the Participant's attaining of age sixty-five (65).

                (c)     Commutation of Benefits. The Committee may, in its sole
     discretion and at any time upon the request of a Participant (or
     Beneficiary), provide for payment of the actuarial equivalent of the
     Supplemental Retirement Benefits at such time and in such forms as it may
     deem appropriate.

     5.6        Accelerated Distribution. Notwithstanding any other provision of
the Plan, at any time after a Change in Control or any time following
termination of employment, a Participant shall be entitled to receive, upon
written request to the Committee, a lump sum distribution equal to ninety
percent (90%) of the actuarial equivalent of the Participant's unpaid benefits
under this Plan on the date on which the Committee receives the written request.
The remaining unpaid benefits shall be forfeited by the Participant. The amount
payable under this Section shall be paid in a lump sum within sixty-five (65)
days following the receipt of the notice by the Committee from the Participant.

     5.7        Withholding; Payroll Taxes. The Employer shall withhold from
payments made hereunder any taxes required to be withheld from a Participant's
wages for the federal or any state or local government. However, a Beneficiary
may elect not to have withholding for federal

                                        8

<PAGE>

income tax purposes pursuant to Section 3405(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code,
or any successor provision.

     5.8        Payment to Guardian. If a Plan benefit is payable to a minor or
a person declared to be incompetent or to a person incapable of handling the
disposition of his property, the Committee may direct payment of such Plan
benefit to the guardian, legal representative or person having the care and
custody of such minor or other person. The Committee may require proof of
incompetence, minority, incapacity or guardianship, as it may deem appropriate
prior to distribution of the Plan benefit. Such distribution shall completely
discharge the Committee and the Employer from all liability with respect to such
benefit.

                                   ARTICLE VI

                             BENEFICIARY DESIGNATION

     6.1        Beneficiary Designation. Each Participant shall have the right,
at any time, to designate any person or persons as his Beneficiary or
Beneficiaries (both primary as well as secondary) to whom benefits under this
Plan shall be paid in the event of his death prior to complete distribution to
the Participant of the benefits due under the Plan. Each Beneficiary designation
shall be in a written form prescribed by the Committee, and will be effective
only when filed with the Committee during the Participant's lifetime.

     6.2        Amendments. Any Beneficiary designation may be changed by a
Participant without the consent of any designated Beneficiary by the filing of a
new Beneficiary designation with the Committee. The filing of a new Beneficiary
designation form will cancel all Beneficiary designations previously filed. If a
Participant's Compensation is community property, any Beneficiary Designation
shall be valid or effective only as permitted under applicable law.

     6.3        No Participant Beneficiary Designation. In the absence of an
effective Beneficiary Designation, or if all designated Beneficiaries predecease
the Participant or die prior to complete distribution of the Participant's
benefits, then the Participant's designated beneficiary shall be deemed to be
the person or persons surviving him in the first of the following classes in

                                    ARTICLE X

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

     10.1       Unfunded Plan. This Plan is an unfunded plan maintained
primarily to provide deferred compensation benefits for a select group of
"management or highly-compensated employees" within the meaning of Sections 201,
301 and 401 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended
("ERISA"), and therefore is exempt from the provisions of Parts 2, 3 and 4 of
Title I of ERISA.

     10.2       Unsecured General Creditor. Participants and their
Beneficiaries, heirs, successors and assigns shall have no legal or equitable
rights, interest or claims in any property or assets of the Employer, nor shall
they be beneficiaries of, or have any rights, claims or interests in any life
insurance policies, annuity contracts or the proceeds therefrom owned or which
may be acquired by the Employer. The Employer's obligation under the Plan shall
be that of an unfunded and unsecured promise of the Employer to pay money in the
future.

     10.3       Trust Fund. At its discretion, the Employer may establish one or
more trusts, with such trustees as the Board may approve, for the purposes of
providing for the payment of benefits owed under the Plan. Although such a trust
shall be irrevocable, its assets shall be held for payment of all the Employer's
general creditors in the event of insolvency or bankruptcy.

                                       11

<PAGE>

To the extent any benefits provided under the Plan are paid from any such trust,
the Employer shall have no further obligations to pay them. If not paid from the
trust, such benefits shall remain the obligation of the Employer.

     10.4       Nonassignability. Neither a Participant nor any other person
shall have any right to commute, sell, assign, transfer, pledge, anticipate,
mortgage or otherwise encumber, transfer, hypothecate or convey in advance of
actual receipt the amounts, if any, payable hereunder, or any part thereof,
which are, and all rights to which are, expressly declared to be unassignable
and non-transferable. No part of the amounts payable shall, prior to actual
payment, be subject to seizure or sequestration for the payment of any debts,
judgments, alimony or separate maintenance owed by a Participant or any other
person, nor be transferable by operation of law in the event of a Participant's
or any other person's bankruptcy or insolvency.

     10.5       Not a Contract of Employment. The terms and conditions of this
Plan shall not be deemed to constitute a contract of employment between the
Employer and the Participant, and the Participant (or his Beneficiary) shall
have no rights against the Employer except as may otherwise be specifically
provided herein. Moreover, nothing in this Plan shall be deemed to give a
Participant the right to be retained in the service of the Employer or to
interfere with the right of the Employer to discipline or discharge him at any
time.

     10.6       Protective Provisions. A Participant shall cooperate with the
Employer by furnishing any and all information requested by the Employer, in
order to facilitate the payment of benefits hereunder, and by taking such
physical examinations as the Employer may deem necessary and taking such other
action as may be requested by the Employer.

     10.7       Terms. Whenever any words are used herein in the masculine, they
shall be construed as though they were used in the feminine in all cases where
they would so apply; and whenever any words are used herein in the singular or
in the plural, they shall be construed as though they were used in the plural or
the singular, as the case may be, in all cases where they would so apply.

     10.8       Captions. The captions of the articles, sections and paragraphs
of this Plan are for convenience only and shall not control or affect the
meaning or construction of any of its provisions.

     10.9       Governing Law. The provisions of this Plan shall be construed
and interpreted according to the laws of the State of Pennsylvania.

     10.10      Validity. In case any provision of this Plan shall be held
invalid or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall not affect the
remaining parts hereof, and this Plan shall be construed and enforced as if such
invalid or unenforceable provision had never been inserted herein.

     10.11      Notice. Any notice or filing required or permitted to be given
to the Committee under the Plan shall be sufficient if in writing and hand
delivered, or sent by registered or certified mail to any member of the
Committee or the Secretary of the Employer. Such notice

                                       12

<PAGE>

shall be deemed given as of the date of delivery or, if delivery is made by
mail, as of the date shown on the postmark on the receipt for registration or
certification.

     10.12      Successors. The provisions of this Plan shall bind and inure to
the benefit of the Employer and its successors and assigns. The term successors
as used herein shall include any corporate or other business entity which shall,
whether by merger, consolidation, purchase or otherwise acquire all or
substantially all of the business and assets of the Employer, and successors of
any such corporation or other business entity.

     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, and pursuant to a resolution of the Board of Directors
of Company duly adopted and approved on November 21, 2000 and February 20, 2001,
the Company has caused this Plan to be executed by its duly authorized officers
effective as of February 22, 2001.
