         fiscal quarters; provided, however, that (a) no change in the
         Applicable Margin shall be effective until three Business Days after

         statements pursuant to Section 6.1(b) and (c), as the case may be, and

         determining such Senior Debt Ratio, and (b) the Applicable Margin shall
         be the highest interest rate margin set forth above with respect to the
         applicable Advances and Unused Fee, respectively, (i) for the period
         commencing on January 1, 2003, through and including June 30, 2003,
         (ii) if AGCO has not submitted to the Administrative Agent the
         information described in clause (a) of this proviso as and when
         required under Section 6.1(b) or (c), as the case may be, for so long
         as such information has not been received by the Administrative Agent,
         and (iii) at the election of the Administrative Agent or the Required
         Lenders, upon the occurrence and during the continuation of any Event
         of Default (whether or not the Default Rate of interest shall then be
         in effect).

         (a)      The execution, delivery and performance by each Borrower of
this Amendment and the other transactions contemplated hereby, are within such
Borrower's corporate powers, have been duly authorized by all necessary

<PAGE>

this Amendment and each other Loan Document contemplated hereby to which it is
or is to be a party, or for the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby;

         (c)      This Amendment and each other document required to be
delivered by a Borrower hereunder has been duly executed and delivered by each
Borrower thereto, and constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of
each Borrower thereto, enforceable against such Borrower in accordance with its
terms;

         (d)      The representations and warranties contained in Article 4 of
the Credit Agreement, and in each of the other Loan Documents, are true and
correct on and as of the date hereof as though made on and as of such date,
other than any such representations and warranties that, by their terms,
expressly refer to an earlier date; and

         (e)      No event has occurred and is continuing which constitutes an
Event of Default or would constitute an Event of Default but for the requirement
that notice be given or time elapse or both.

         SECTION 4. Conditions Precedent to Effectiveness of this Amendment.
This Amendment shall be effective as of the date first set forth above when the
Administrative Agent shall have received, in form and substance satisfactory to
it, each of the following:

         (a)      this Amendment, duly executed by the Borrowers, the
Administrative Agent and the Required Lenders;

         (b)      an amendment fee for the account of each Lender that delivered
to the Administrative Agent prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on December
23, 2002, such Lender's executed consent to the terms of this Amendment (as
described in the Amendment Summary distributed to the Lenders via IntraLinks on
December 9, 2002), in an amount equal to fifteen (15) basis points of each such
Lender's Commitment; and

         (c)      the payment of such other fees, and the delivery of such other
documents, instruments, and information, as the Administrative Agent may
reasonably request.


         SECTION 5. Reference to and Effect on the Credit Agreement. Upon the
effectiveness of this Amendment as set forth in Section 4 hereof, on and after
the date hereof, each reference in the Credit Agreement to "this Agreement",
"hereunder", "hereof", "herein" or words of like import shall mean and be a
reference to the Credit Agreement as amended hereby, and each reference in the
Notes and the other Loan Documents to the Credit Agreement shall mean and be a
reference to the Credit Agreement as amended hereby.

         SECTION 6. Costs, Expenses and Taxes. The Borrowers agree, jointly and
severally, to pay on demand all costs and expenses of the Administrative Agent
in connection with the preparation, execution and delivery of this Amendment and
the other


                                      -5-
<PAGE>

instruments and documents to be delivered hereunder (including, without
limitation, the fees and expenses of counsel for the Administrative Agent with
respect thereto).

         SECTION 7. No Other Amendments. Except as otherwise expressed herein,
the execution, delivery and effectiveness of this Amendment shall not operate as
a waiver of any right, power or remedy of the Agents or the Lenders under the
Credit Agreement, or any of the other Loan Documents, nor constitute a waiver of
any provision of the Credit Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents. Except
for the amendment set forth above, the text of the Credit Agreement and all
other Loan Documents shall remain unchanged and in full force and effect and the
Borrowers hereby ratify and confirm their respective obligations thereunder.
This Amendment shall not constitute a modification of the Credit Agreement or a
course of dealing with the Administrative Agent at variance with the Credit
Agreement such as to require further notice by the Administrative Agent to
require strict compliance with the terms of the Credit Agreement and the other
Loan Documents in the future, except as expressly set forth herein. The
Borrowers acknowledge and expressly agree that the Agents and the Lenders
reserve the right to, and do in fact, require strict compliance with all terms
and provisions of the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents (in each
case as amended hereby).

         SECTION 8. Execution in Counterparts. This Amendment may be executed in
any number of counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall
be deemed to be an original and all of which taken together shall constitute but
one and the same instrument. Delivery of a signature page hereto by facsimile
transmission shall be as effective as delivery of a manually executed
counterpart hereof.

         SECTION 9. Governing Law. This Amendment shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws (without giving effect to the conflicts
of laws principles thereof) of the State of New York.

         SECTION 10. Final Agreement. This Amendment represents the final
agreement between the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent, the Canadian
Administrative Agent and the Lenders as to the subject matter hereof and may not
be contradicted by evidence of prior, contemporaneous or subsequent oral
agreements of the parties. There are no unwritten oral agreements between the
parties. The Amendment shall constitute a Loan Document for all purposes.
