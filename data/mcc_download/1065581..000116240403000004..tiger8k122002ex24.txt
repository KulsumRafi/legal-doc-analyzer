                            SHARE PURCHASE AGREEMENT


This SHARE  PURCHASE  AGREEMENT  (the  "Agreement"),  is made and  entered  into
December 20, 2002, by and among TIGER TELEMATICS,  INC., a Delaware  corporation
("Seller"),  TIGER TELEMATICS, LTD. a United Kingdom corporation ("Target"), and
Norrtulls Mobilextra Aktiebolag ("Buyer").
                                   BACKGROUND:
               Buyer  is  a  Swedish  corporation  engaged  in  retail  sale  of
               telecommunication equipment.
Target is the wholly owned subsidiary of seller Tiger Telematics, Inc. (Seller).
Target is engaged in the business of  developing,  manufacturing  and  marketing
automotive  telematics products (the "Business") in Europe. Target has developed
other unrelated  products,  Childtracker  and non Eagle Eye Telematics  tracking
units that have been transferred to another UK subsidiary of Seller.

Buyer desires to purchase and Seller  desires to sale the common stock of Target
and Target desires to sell, transfer and deliver to Buyer, certain of the assets
and  liabilities of Target in exchange for a Royalty  Agreement on the terms and
conditions of this Agreement.  Buyer specifically wants the Scandinavian  orders
for Eagle Eye Product  "Order Book",  the prepaid  commission on the Order Book,
the  inventory of finished  goods Eagle Eye  telematics  units and to assume all
rights under the Eagle Eye Distribution Agreement.

The Seller has in other UK subsidiaries  orders relating to London,  Hertz, Easy
Car, and any order potential that is unrelated to the Order Book. Wireless phone
agreements relative to O2, Vodaphone, and Orange etc. have been placed by Seller
in  another  subsidiary  and are not a part of the  sale.  Correspondingly,  the
Seller has transferred all Directors and related party  shareholder  debt to the
other UK subsidiaries to offset the transfer of these assets.

In addition,  Buyer will enter into a 10 year Royalty Agreement,  (collectively,
the  "Related  Agreements")   immediately  prior  to  the  consummation  of  the
transactions   contemplated  hereby.  All  capitalized  (and  as  noted  herein,
uncapitalized)  words  or  expressions  used in this  Agreement  (including  the
Schedules and Exhibits  annexed  hereto) not otherwise  defined  herein have the
meanings  specified in Exhibit A hereto (such meanings to be equally  applicable
to both the singular and plural forms of the terms defined).  This Agreement and
the  agreements  and  instruments  to be executed  and  delivered at Closing are
referred  to  collectively  herein  as  the  "Transaction  Agreements"  and  the
transactions   contemplated  by  the  Transaction  Agreements  are  referred  to
collectively herein as the "Transactions".

In consideration of the foregoing,  the mutual  representations,  warranties and
covenants  set  forth  in  this  Agreement,   and  for  the  good  and  valuable
consideration,  the  sufficiency  of which is hereby  acknowledged,  the parties
hereto agree as follows:

Code of 1986, as amended and interpreted by treasury  regulations;  "Tax Return"
means any return,  declaration,  report, claim for refund, or information return
or statement  relating to Taxes,  including any schedule or attachment  thereto,
and  including  any amendment  thereof;  and "Taxes"  means any federal,  state,

was  required to file.  All such Tax  Returns  are  correct and  complete in all
respects. All Taxes owed by Target (whether or not shown on any Tax Return) have
been paid.  Target  currently is not the  beneficiary  of any  extension of time
within which to file any Tax Return. No claim has ever been made by an authority
in a  jurisdiction  where  Target does not file Tax Returns that it is or may be
subject to taxation by that jurisdiction.  There are no liens, encumbrances,  or
charges  against any of the assets of Target that arose in  connection  with any

directors,  or employees  responsible for Tax matters has knowledge of any facts
that would lead them to expect any authority to assess any additional  Taxes for
any period for which Tax Returns  have been filed.  There is no dispute or claim
concerning any Tax liability of Target either claimed or raised by any authority
in  writing  or as to  which  any of  target,  Stockholder  or any of  Target's,
officers,  directors,  or employees  responsible  for Tax matters has  knowledge
based  upon  personal  contact  with any  agent of such  authority.  The List of
Schedule  lists all Tax  Returns  filed for  taxable  periods  ended on or after
December  31,  2000,  indicates  those Tax  Returns  that have been  audited and
indicates  those Tax Returns that currently are the subject of an audit.  Target
has  delivered  to the Buyer  correct and  complete  copies of all Tax  Returns,
examination reports,  closing agreements and statements of deficiencies assessed
against or agreed to by Target since December 31, 2002.  Target has disclosed on
its federal income Tax Returns all positions  taken therein that could give rise
to a substantial  understatement of federal income Tax within the meaning of IRC
Section 6662.

shall be deemed to have been relied  upon by the  parties and shall  survive the
Closing  hereof  for a  period  of two (2)  years  and  shall  not  merge in the
performance of any obligation by any party hereto;  provided,  however, that all
such matters relating to Product  Liability,  Environmental  Laws or Taxes shall
survive the Closing for the period of the statute of  limitations  applicable to
such matters.

       11.2 Indemnification Rights of Buyer.

              (a) Seller and jointly and severally  agrees to defend,  indemnify
and hold Buyer and their respective  subsidiaries and affiliates and the persons
serving  as  officers,   directors,   partners,   employees  or  agents  thereof
(hereinafter   collectively  referred  to  as  "Buyer  Indemnified  Parties"  or
individually  as a "Buyer  Indemnified  Party")  harmless  from and  against any
damages, liabilities,  losses, fines, penalties, clean-up costs, study costs and
expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable counsel fees and expenses as
the same are incurred) (collectively, "Losses") of any kind or nature whatsoever
that may be sustained or suffered by any of them arising out of or based upon or
in  connection  with  any  of  the  following   matters   (notwithstanding   any
investigation by or knowledge of any of the Buyer Indemnified Parties):

                     (i) a breach of any  representation,  warranty,  agreement,
covenant or  obligation  made by the Seller (but not any other  Stockholder)  in
this Agreement or in any exhibit,  schedule,  certificate or financial statement
delivered  hereunder or in connection herewith or by reason of any claim, action
or proceeding  asserted or instituted or growing out of any matter or thing that
constitutes  or is  alleged  by a third  party to  constitute  a breach  of such
representations, warranties or covenants; and


                                       22
<PAGE>

                     (ii) any claims of third parties arising out of or relating
the Retained Liabilities.

Seller shall have no obligation to indemnify  any Buyer  Indemnified  Party from
and against any Losses as to which a claim for indemnification is not made on or
before the second  anniversary  of the  Closing  Date,  except  with  respect to
Product  Liability,   Environmental  Laws  or  Taxes,  as  to  which  any  Buyer
Indemnified Party can make a claim on or before the date on which the statute of
limitations period applicable to such matters expires.
No claims for Losses  shall be brought  hereunder  by Buyer until the  aggregate
amount of such claims exceeds  $50,000,  and, if the aggregate  amount of Losses
claimed  hereunder  exceeds  $50,000 and Buyer are  entitled to  indemnification
pursuant hereto, Buyer shall be entitled to collect any Losses in excess of such
$50,000.

              (b) The Buyer Indemnified Parties shall give prompt written notice
to Target  and  Seller  from  which  indemnification  is  sought  of any  claim,
liability or expense to which the  indemnification  obligations  hereunder would
apply.  Such notice shall state the  information  then  available  regarding the
amount of such claim,  liability or expense and shall  specify the  provision or
provisions  of this  Agreement  under which the claim,  liability  or expense is
asserted.  The failure to promptly notify the Seller as provided above shall not
relieve  the Seller of any  liability  hereunder  except to the extent  that the
rights of the Seller have been  materially and adversely  prejudiced as a result
of the failure to give, or the delay in giving, such notice.

              (c) If such  indemnification  claim,  liability  or expense is the
subject of  litigation,  the Seller shall have the right to participate at their
own expense in the defense of any such litigation. The Buyer Indemnified Parties
may, in their sole discretion, authorize the Seller , if they so desire, to take
over the defense of such  litigation so long as such defense is expeditious  and
is undertaken by counsel acceptable to the Buyer Indemnified Parties;  provided,
however,  that the Seller shall not enter into any  settlement  that has binding
effect on the Buyer  without  the prior  written  consent  of the  Buyer,  which
consent shall not be unreasonably  withheld. In addition,  the Buyer Indemnified
Party may not enter into any settlement in which an  indemnifying  party will be
liable hereunder without the consent of such indemnifying party.

       11.3 Indemnification Rights of Seller.

              (a) Buyer  agree to defend,  indemnify  and hold  Seller and their
respective  subsidiaries  and  affiliates  and the persons  serving as officers,
directors,  partners,  employees  or agents  thereof  (hereinafter  collectively
referred  to as  "Seller  Indemnified  Parties"  or  individually  as a  "Seller
Indemnified  Party")  harmless from and against any Losses of any kind or nature
whatsoever  that may be  sustained  or suffered by any of them arising out of or
based upon or in connection with any of the following matters:

                     (i) a breach of any  representation,  warranty,  agreement,
covenant  or  obligation  made by Buyer  in this  Agreement  or in any  exhibit,
schedule or  certificate  delivered  hereunder or in  connection  herewith or by
reason of any claim,  action or proceeding asserted or instituted growing out of
any  matter  or  thing  that  constitutes  or is  alleged  by a third  party  to
constitute a breach of such representations, warranties or covenants; and


                                       23
<PAGE>

                     (ii) any claims of third parties arising out of or relating
to the  ownership or operation of the shares of Tiger  Telematics,  Ltd.Acquired
Assets  or the  Business  by Buyer  after the  Closing  Date,  whether  accrued,
absolute,  contingent or otherwise,  including the Assumed Liabilities,  but not
including the Retained Liabilities.

Buyer shall have no obligation to indemnify  any Seller  Indemnified  Party from
and against any Losses as to which a claim for indemnification is not made on or
before  the  third  anniversary  of the  Closing  Date.  In no event  shall  the
indemnification  obligations  of the  Buyer to all  Seller  Indemnified  parties
exceed $5,000,000.

              (b) The  Seller  Indemnified  Parties  shall give  prompt  written
notice to Buyer of any claim,  liability or expense to which the indemnification
obligations  hereunder would apply. Such notice shall state the information then
available  regarding  the amount of such claim,  liability  or expense and shall
specify the  provision or provisions  of this  Agreement  under which the claim,
liability  or expense is  asserted.  The  failure to  promptly  notify  Buyer as
provided above shall not relieve Buyer of any liability  hereunder except to the
extent that the rights of Buyer have been materially and adversely prejudiced as
a result of the failure to give, or the delay in giving, such notice.

              (c) If such  indemnification  claim,  liability  or expense is the
subject of  litigation,  Buyer shall have the right to  participate at their own
expense in the defense of any such litigation.  The Seller  Indemnified  Parties
may, in their sole  discretion,  authorize  Buyer if they so desire to take over
the defense of such  litigation  so long as such defense is  expeditious  and is
undertaken by counsel  acceptable to the Seller Indemnified  Parties;  provided,
however, that Buyer shall not enter into any settlement which has binding effect
on Seller  without  the prior  written  consent  of Seller,  which  shall not be
unreasonably withheld.

       11.4 Indemnification Payments and Dispute Resolution. Any indemnification
amounts due under Section 11.2 or 11.3 shall be paid within 30 days after notice
thereof is given by the party seeking  indemnification unless within said 30-day
period the party providing  indemnification  indicates in a writing delivered to
the party seeking  indemnification  that it disputes the nature or amount of the
claim for  indemnification in which event the dispute,  upon the election of any
party  hereto  after said  30-day  period,  shall be  referred  to the  American
Arbitration  Association  to be settled by  arbitration in Florida in accordance
with the UNCITRAL rules of commercial arbitration.  The fees and expenses of the
arbitrator  shall be borne by that party (with  Seller and Buyer  together  each
being considered one party) whose last offer of settlement differed by a greater
amount from the arbitrator's  award than did the last offer of settlement of the
other party;  provided,  however, that no offer of settlement shall be disclosed
to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator renders an award on the merits. The
determination of the arbitrator as to the amount, if any, of the indemnification
claim,  liability or expense that is properly  allowable shall be conclusive and
binding  upon the  parties  hereto and  payment  shall be made as so  determined
within five business days of the date of such award. The judgment upon the award
may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. There shall be added to
the  amount of any  arbitration  award  interest  at the rate of 10% per  annum,
accrued daily,  on the amount  required to be paid pursuant to such award.  This
interest  will be  computed  from the date  payment  would have been paid if not
disputed to the date paid and the arbitrator shall include provisions  therefore
in any award rendered.

       12.2 Successors and Assigns.  This  Agreement,  and all rights and powers
granted  hereby,  will bind and inure to the benefit of the  parties  hereto and
their respective  successors and assigns,  but neither this Agreement nor any of
the rights,  interests, or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the
parties hereto without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto.

       12.3  Construction.   The  parties  have  participated   jointly  in  the
negotiation  and  drafting  of this  Agreement.  In the  event an  ambiguity  or
question of intent or interpretation  arises,  this Agreement shall be construed
as if drafted jointly by the parties and no presumption or burden of proof shall
arise  favoring or  disfavoring  any party by virtue of the authorship of any of
the provisions of this Agreement. Any reference to any federal, state, local, or
foreign  statute  or law  shall  be  deemed  also  to  refer  to all  rules  and
regulations promulgated thereunder,  unless the context requires otherwise.  The
word "including"  shall mean including  without  limitation.  The parties intend
that each  representation,  warranty,  and covenant  contained herein shall have
independent  significance.   If  any  party  has  breached  any  representation,


                                       25
<PAGE>

warranty,  or  covenant  contained  herein in any  respect,  the fact that there
exists  another  representation,  warranty,  or  covenant  relating  to the same
subject matter  (regardless  of the relative  levels of  specificity)  which the
party has not  breached  shall not detract  from or  mitigate  the fact that the
party is in breach of the  first  representation,  warranty,  or  covenant.  All
pronouns and any variations thereof refer to the masculine,  feminine or neuter,
singular or plural,  as the identity of the Person or Persons may  require.  All
references herein to Articles,  Sections (other than Sections of the Code or any
other  statute) and  subsections  shall be deemed to be  references to Articles,
Sections and  subsections of this Agreement  unless the context shall  otherwise
require.

       12.4  Governing  Law.  With  respect  to  corporate   governance  matters
concerning a corporation of any  jurisdiction,  this Agreement shall be governed
by and construed in accordance with the laws of such jurisdiction.  With respect
to all other  matters,  this  Agreement  shall be governed by and  construed  in
accordance with the laws of State of Florida, without regard to the conflicts of
law provisions thereof.

       12.5  Headings.  The  headings  preceding  the text of the  sections  and
subsections  hereof are inserted  solely for  convenience of reference and shall
not  constitute  a part of this  Agreement,  nor shall they affect its  meaning,
construction, or effect.

       12.6  Counterparts.  This  Agreement  may be  executed  in  two  or  more
counterparts,  each of which  shall be deemed an  original,  but which  together
shall constitute one and the same instrument.

       12.7 Further  Assurances.  Both before and after Closing hereunder,  each
party shall  cooperate  and take such action as may be  reasonably  requested by
another  party in order to more fully carry out the  provisions  and purposes of
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

       12.8 Course of Dealing.  No course of dealing and no delay on the part of
any party hereto in exercising  any right,  power,  or remedy  conferred by this
Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof or otherwise  prejudice such party's
rights, powers and remedies. The failure of any of the parties to this Agreement
to require the  performance of a term or obligation  under this Agreement or the
waiver by any of the parties to this Agreement of any breach hereunder shall not
prevent subsequent  enforcement of such term or obligation or be deemed a waiver
of an subsequent breach hereunder.  No single or partial exercise of any rights,
powers or remedies  conferred  by this  Agreement  shall  preclude  any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy.

       12.9  Severability.  This Agreement  shall be deemed  severable,  and the
invalidity or  unenforceability of any term or provision hereof shall not affect
the  validity  or  enforceability  of this  Agreement  or of any  other  term or
provision hereof. Furthermore, in lieu of any such invalid or unenforceable term
or provision,  the parties  hereto intend that there shall be added as a part of
this Agreement a provision as similar in terms to such invalid or  unenforceable
provision as may be valid and  enforceable,  so as to effect the original intent
of the parties to the greatest extent possible.

Certificates  hereto, each of which is hereby incorporated herein, set forth all

         jurisdiction or any other competent body in any jurisdiction (including
         both by reason of the provisions of any  legislation and also by reason
         of any decision of any court or authority having  jurisdiction over the
         parties in the Territory),  then that provision shall be severed in the
         jurisdiction   in  question   and  such   invalidity,   illegality   or

         the validity or enforceability of the remainder.  To the extent legally
         permissible,  an arrangement  which reflects the original intent of the
         parties  shall  be  substituted  for  such  invalid  or   unenforceable
         provision  provided  always  that if the  reasonable  opinion of either
         party any such severance  materially  affects the  commercial  basis of
         this Agreement and no agreement can be reached by the parties as to the
         means by which such matters can be resolved,  such party shall have the
         right to terminate this Agreement with immediate  effect upon giving 90
