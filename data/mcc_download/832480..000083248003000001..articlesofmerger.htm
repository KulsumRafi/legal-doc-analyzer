                                       OF
             FIRST COMMONWEALTH CORPORATION, A VIRGINIA CORPORATION
                                  WITH AND INTO
                UNITED TRUST GROUP, INC., AN ILLINOIS CORPORATION</B>



     Pursuant  to the  provisions  of  Sections  13.1-720  and  13.1-722  of the
Virginia  Stock  Corporation  Act (the  "VSCA"),  United Trust Group,  Inc.,  an
Illinois  corporation ("UTG"), as the surviving entity of the proposed merger of
First Commonwealth  Corporation,  a Virginia corporation ("FCC"),  with and into
UTG,  hereby adopts the following  Articles of Merger for the purpose of merging
FCC with and into UTG.

     1. Attached hereto as <U>Annex A</U> and made a part hereof, is a copy of the Plan
of Merger (the "Plan of Merger") pursuant to which FCC shall merge with and into
UTG in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia and the State of
Illinois.

     2. Pursuant to Section 13.1-722(A)(3) of the VSCA, UTG is the only party to
the Plan of Merger that was not organized under the laws of the  Commonwealth of
Virginia;  UTG was  incorporated  under the laws of the State of  Illinois.  UTG
shall be the surviving  corporation  of the merger and shall continue to conduct
business  under  its  present  name,   United  Trust  Group,   Inc.  The  merger
contemplated  by the Plan of Merger is permitted  under the laws of the State of
Illinois,  and UTG complied  with such laws in effecting  the merger.  Under the
laws of the  State  of  Illinois,  no  approval  of the  Plan of  Merger  by the
shareholders of UTG was necessary.

     3. UTG, as the  surviving  corporation  of the merger,  is hereby deemed to
make the  appointment and agreement  contemplated by Section  13.1-722(B) of the
VSCA.

     4. The Plan of Merger was submitted to the shareholders of FCC by its board
of directors in accordance  the VSCA.  The  designation,  number of  outstanding
shares,  number of votes  entitled to be cast by each voting  group  entitled to
vote  separately  on the Plan of  Merger,  and the  number of votes cast for and
against the Plan of Merger by each voting group was as follows:

                  Designation of shares                            Common Stock

                  Number of outstanding shares                        54,385

                  Number of votes entitled to be cast                 54,385

                  Total number of votes cast FOR
                       the Plan of Merger                             46,728

                  Total number of votes cast AGAINST
                       the Plan of Merger                                417


     The  number  of votes  cast for the Plan of Merger  set forth  above by the
holders of FCC Common  Stock was  sufficient  for  approval by that voting group
under Section 13.1-718 of the VSCA.

     5. These Articles of Merger shall become  effective at 10:00 a.m.,  eastern
daylight time (9:00 a.m., central daylight time), on Wednesday, June 12, 2002.


                            <B>[SIGNATURE PAGE FOLLOWS]</B>



     IN WITNESS  WHEREOF,  FCC and UTG have executed these Articles of Merger as
of the <U>30th</U> day of May, 2002.

          and UTG shall  also  prepare,  and file with the SEC, a  statement  on
          <U>Schedule  13E-3</U>  (together  with any  supplements or amendments
          thereto,  the  "Schedule  13E-3").  Each  of FCC  and  UTG  shall  use
          reasonable   best  efforts  to  have  the  Proxy   Statement  and,  if
          applicable,  the  Schedule  13E-3,  cleared by the SEC as necessary to
          consummate the Merger and the transactions  contemplated  hereby.  UTG
          and FCC shall,  as  promptly as  practicable  after  receipt  thereof,
          provide the other Party copies of any written  comments and advise the
          other Party of any oral comments,  with respect to the Proxy Statement

          approval of both Parties,  which  approval  shall not be  unreasonably
          withheld or delayed;  provided that with respect to documents filed by
          a Party which are  incorporated  by reference in the Schedule 13E-3 or
          the Proxy  Statement,  this right of  approval  shall  apply only with
          respect to  information  relating to the other Party or its  business,
          financial condition or results of operations.  FCC will use reasonable
          best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement and the Schedule 13E-3 to be
          mailed to the Shareholders,  as promptly as practicable after the same
          is cleared by the SEC.  Each  Party  will  advise the other,  promptly
          after  it  receives  notice  thereof,  of any  request  by the SEC for
          amendment of the Proxy Statement or the Schedule 13E-3. If at any time
          prior to the Effective Time any information relating to UTG or FCC, or
          any of their respective affiliates,  officers or directors,  should be
          discovered by UTG or FCC, which information  should be set forth in an
          amendment  or  supplement  to either the  Schedule  13E-3 or the Proxy
          Statement  so  that  any of  such  documents  would  not  include  any
          misstatement  of a material  fact or omit to state any  material  fact
          required  to be stated  therein or  necessary  to make the  statements
          therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
          misleading,  the Party which discovers such information shall promptly
          notify the other  Party and, to the extent  required by law,  rules or
          regulations,  an appropriate  amendment or supplement  describing such
          information  shall be promptly filed with the SEC and  disseminated to
          the Shareholders.

     (b)  FCC shall duly take all lawful action to call, give notice of, convene
          and  hold a  meeting  of the  Shareholders  on a  date  determined  in
          accordance   with   the   mutual   agreement   of  FCC  and  UTG  (the
          "<U>Shareholders'  Meeting</U>") for the purpose of obtaining the approval of
          this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including the
          Merger) by the Shareholders (the "<U>FCC Shareholder Approval</U>") and shall
          its  use   reasonable   best  efforts  to  solicit  the  vote  of  the
          Shareholders.   Subject  to  their  fiduciary  duties,  the  Board  of
          Directors  of FCC shall  recommend  adoption of this  Agreement by the
          Shareholders.

Section 1.08 <U>Exchange Procedures</U>

     (a)  Promptly  after the Effective  Time, the Surviving  Corporation  shall
          mail (or shall  cause an exchange  agent  appointed  by the  Surviving
          Corporation to mail) to each record holder,  as of the Effective Time,
          of any outstanding certificate or certificates which immediately prior
          to the  Effective  Time  represented  shares of FCC Common  Stock (the
          "<U>FCC  Certificates</U>")  a (i) notice of the  effectiveness of the
          Merger and (ii) form letter of  transmittal  (which shall specify that
          delivery  shall be  effected,  and  risk of loss and  title to the FCC
          Certificates   shall  pass  only  upon  proper  delivery  of  the  FCC
          Certificates to the Surviving Corporation) and instructions for use in
          effecting the surrender of the FCC Certificates for payment  therefor.
          Upon  surrender to the Surviving  Corporation  of an FCC  Certificate,
          together with the appropriate and duly executed transmittal  materials
          described in the foregoing sentence and any other required  documents,
          the holder of such FCC Certificate shall receive in exchange therefore
          the applicable  Merger  Consideration  determined  pursuant to Section
          1.06 hereof,  and such  Certificate  shall forthwith be cancelled.  No
          interest will be paid or accrued on any consideration payable upon the
          surrender of the FCC  Certificates.  If payment is to be remitted to a
          name  other  than that in which the FCC  Certificate  surrendered  for
          exchange is registered,  it shall be a condition of such exchange that
          the FCC Certificate so surrendered  shall be properly  endorsed,  with
          signature  guaranteed,  or  otherwise  in proper form for transfer and
          that the  person  requesting  such  exchange  shall  pay to UTG or its
          transfer  agent any transfer or other taxes  required by reason of the
          payment of the applicable Merger  Consideration to a person other than
          the registered holder of the FCC Certificate surrendered, or establish
          to the  satisfaction  of UTG or its  transfer  agent that such tax has
          been paid or is not applicable.  Until  surrendered in accordance with
          the provisions of this Section 1.08, each FCC Certificate  (other than
          FCC  Certificates  representing  shares to be  cancelled  pursuant  to
          Sections 1.06(a)(ii) or 1.06(a)(iii)) shall represent for all purposes
          only the right to receive  the  applicable  Merger  Consideration  set
          forth in Section 1.06,  without any interest  thereon,  subject to any
          required withholding taxes.

     (b)  From and after the  Effective  Time,  the holders of FCC  Certificates
          evidencing   shares  of  FCC  Common  Stock  issued  and   outstanding
          immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights
          with respect to such shares,  except as otherwise provided herein, the
          Plan of Merger or by applicable law.

     (c)  Any holders of shares of FCC Common Stock prior to the Merger who have
          not  complied   with  this  Article  I  and   surrendered   their  FCC
          Certificates  to the Surviving  Corporation  in  accordance  with this
          Section  1.08  within six (6) months  after the  Effective  Time shall
          thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation as general creditors
          thereof  for  payment  of  their  claim  for  the  applicable   Merger
          Consideration  to which such  holders  may be  entitled  hereunder  by
          virtue of the Merger.

     (d)  Neither FCC nor the  Surviving  Corporation  (nor any  exchange  agent
          appointed by the Surviving  Corporation pursuant to this Section 1.08)
          shall  be  liable  to  any   Shareholder  in  respect  of  any  Merger
          Consideration  to  which  such  Shareholder  was  otherwise   entitled
          pursuant to this Agreement  delivered to a public official pursuant to
          any applicable abandoned property,  escheat or similar law. If any FCC
          Certificates  shall  not have been  surrendered  prior to one (1) year
          after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on
          which any Merger Consideration, if any, in respect of such certificate
          would otherwise  escheat to or become the property of any governmental
          entity),  any such Merger Consideration in respect of such certificate
          shall, to the extent  permitted by applicable law, become the property
          of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest
          of any Person previously entitled thereto.

     (e)  From and after the Effective Time,  there shall be no transfers of the
          shares  of  FCC  Common  Stock  on the  stock  transfer  books  of the
          Surviving Corporation which were outstanding  immediately prior to the
          Effective Time.

     (f)  In the event any FCC  Certificate  shall  have  been  lost,  stolen or
          destroyed,  the Surviving Corporation shall issue in exchange for such
          lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, upon the making of an affidavit
          of  that  fact  by the  holder  thereof,  such  amount  of the  Merger
          Consideration,  if any,  as may be required  pursuant to Section  1.06
          hereof; <I>provided,  however</I>, that the Surviving Corporation may, in its
          discretion  and as a  condition  precedent  to the  issuance  thereof,
          require  the  Shareholder  who is the  owner of such  lost,  stolen or
          destroyed  certificate  to  deliver  a bond in such  amount  as it may
          reasonably  direct  against  any claim  that may be made  against  the
          Surviving  Corporation with respect to the certificate alleged to have
          been lost, stolen or destroyed.

Section 1.09 <U>Taking of Necessary  Action;  Further Action</U>.  If at any time after
the Effective  Time,  any further  action is necessary or desirable to carry out
the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving  Corporation  with full
right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges,  powers
and  franchises  of FCC, UTG and the officers and directors of the UTG are fully
authorized  in the name of UTG or  otherwise  to take,  and will take,  all such
lawful and necessary action.

                                   <B>Article II.
                      REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF FCC</B>

     FCC hereby  represents and warrants to UTG that, except as disclosed in the
FCC Filed SEC Reports (as defined below):

Section 2.01 <U>Organization, Standing and Power; Subsidiaries</U>.

     (a)  FCC is a  corporation  duly  organized,  validly  existing and in good
          standing  under the laws of the  Commonwealth  of Virginia and has the
          corporate  power to own its properties and to carry on its business as
          now being conducted.  Each subsidiary of FCC is a corporation or other
          organization  duly  organized,  validly  existing and in good standing
          under the laws of its  jurisdiction of  incorporation or organization,
          has the requisite corporate or other power and authority to own, lease
          and  operate  its  properties  and to carry on its  business as is now
          being conducted, except where the failure to be so organized, existing
          and in good  standing  or to have such power and  authority  would not
          reasonably be expected to have a Material  Adverse  Effect on FCC. For
          purposes of this  Agreement,  the term "Material  Adverse Effect" on a
          Party shall mean an event, change or occurrence which, individually or
          together with any other event,  change or  occurrence,  has a material
          impact  on  (a)  the  financial  position,  business,  or  results  of
          operations of such Party and its subsidiaries  (though with respect to
          UTG, excluding FCC and its subsidiaries), taken as a whole, or (b) the
          ability of such Party to perform its obligations  under this Agreement
          or  to  consummate  the  Merger,  other  than  any  event,  change  or
          occurrence  relating to (i) the United  States  economy,  the regional
          economy  in which  such  Party  conducts  business  or the  securities
          markets  in  general  or  (ii)  this  Agreement  or  the  transactions
          contemplated hereby or announcement hereof.

     (b)  Each  of FCC  and  its  subsidiaries  is  duly  qualified  and in good
          standing to do business  in each  jurisdiction  in which the nature of
          its business or the ownership or leasing of its  properties  make such
          qualification  necessary  other than in such  jurisdictions  where the
          failure so to qualify or to be in good standing  would not  reasonably
          be expected  to have a Material  Adverse  Effect on FCC.  FCC has made
          available  to  UTG  a  true  and  correct  copy  of  its  articles  of
          incorporation  and  bylaws,  each as amended to date and in full force
          and effect on the date hereof.

Section 2.02 <U>Capital Structure</U>.

     (a)  The  authorized  capital stock of FCC consists of 62,500 shares of FCC
          Common Stock,  of which 54,385 shares are issued and outstanding as of
          the date hereof (reflecting the 1 for 400 reverse stock split approved
          by FCC's Board of Directors  on March 27, 1997,  but for which FCC did
          not obtain  shareholder  approval or file an amendment to its articles
          of incorporation). All outstanding shares of FCC Common Stock are duly
          authorized,  validly issued,  fully paid and nonassessable and free of
          any preemptive rights.

     (b)  (i) FCC does not have any  stock  option  plan or other  stock-related
          plan providing for equity  compensation of any person,  (ii) there are
          no options,  warrants, calls, rights, commitments or agreements of any
          character,  written or oral, to which FCC is a party or by which it is
          bound obligating it to issue, deliver,  sell, repurchase or redeem, or
          cause to be issued,  delivered,  sold,  repurchased  or redeemed,  any
          shares  of FCC  Common  Stock,  (iii) FCC is not  obligated  to grant,
          extend,  accelerate  the  vesting of,  change the price of,  otherwise
          amend or enter into any option,  warrant,  call, right,  commitment or
          agreement upon the closing of the transactions  contemplated hereby or
          upon the occurrence of any other event, and (iv) no bonds, debentures,
          notes or other  indebtedness of FCC exists having the right to vote on
          any matters on which holders of capital stock of FCC may vote.

Section 2.03 <U>Authority; No Conflicts</U>.

     (a)  Subject,  in the case of the  consummation  of the Merger,  to the FCC
          Shareholder  Approval,  any approvals or clearances required under the
          applicable  insurance laws of any state,  the filings  contemplated by
          Section  1.07  and the  filing  of the  Plan of  Merger,  and  related
          articles of merger, with the Virginia State Corporation Commission and
          the Illinois  Secretary of State,  (i) FCC has all requisite power and
          authority  to  enter  into  this   Agreement  and  to  consummate  the
          transactions  contemplated  hereby, (ii) the execution and delivery of
          this Agreement and the consummation of the  transactions  contemplated
          hereby have been duly authorized by all necessary  corporate action on
          the part of FCC and no further  action is  required on the part of FCC
          to authorize this Agreement and the transactions  contemplated hereby,
          (iii) this  Agreement,  the Plan of Merger  and the  Merger  have been
          unanimously  approved  and adopted by the Board of Directors of FCC in
          accordance  with Virginia law, and the articles of  incorporation  and
          bylaws of FCC,  and (iv) this  Agreement  has been duly  executed  and
          delivered by FCC, and assuming the due  authorization,  execution  and
          delivery by the other Party hereto,  constitutes the valid and binding
          obligation  of FCC,  enforceable  against  it in  accordance  with its
          terms,  except as such  enforceability  may be  subject to the laws of
          general application relating to bankruptcy,  insolvency and the relief
          of debtors and rules of law governing specific performance, injunctive
          relief or other equitable remedies.

     (b)  The  execution  and  delivery  by  FCC  of  this   Agreement  and  the
          consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not conflict
          with or result in any  violation of or default  under (with or without
          notice  or  lapse  of  time,  or  both)  or give  rise  to a right  of
          termination,   cancellation,   modification  or  acceleration  of  any
          obligation or loss of any benefit under (any such event, a "<U>Conflict</U>")
          (i) any provision of the articles of  incorporation  or bylaws of FCC,
          (ii)  except as would not  reasonably  be  expected to have a Material
          Adverse  Effect on FCC,  any  mortgage,  indenture,  lease,  contract,
          covenant  or  other  agreement,   instrument  or  commitment,  permit,
          concession,  franchise or license (individually a "<U>Contract</U>") to which
          FCC or any of its subsidiaries or any of their  respective  properties
          or assets (including  intangible  assets), is subject, or (iii) except
          as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material  Adverse Effect
          on FCC, any judgment,  order, decree, statute, law, ordinance, rule or
          regulation  applicable  to FCC or  any of its  subsidiaries  or any of
          their respective properties or assets (tangible and intangible).

Section 2.04 <U>Reports and Financial Statements</U>.

     (a)  FCC has  filed all  required  registration  statements,  prospectuses,
          reports,  schedules, forms, statements and other documents required to
          be filed by it with the SEC since December 31, 1998 (collectively, the
          "<U>FCC SEC  Reports</U>").  No  subsidiary of FCC is required to file
          any form, report, registration statement, prospectus or other document
          with  the SEC.  None of the FCC SEC  Reports,  as of their  respective
          dates (and,  if amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date of
          this  Agreement,  then on the date of such filing),  contained or will
          contain  any untrue  statement  of a material  fact or omitted or will
          omit to  state a  material  fact  required  to be  stated  therein  or
          necessary   to  make  the   statements   therein,   in  light  of  the
          circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.  All of such
          FCC SEC Reports,  as of their  respective dates (and as of the date of
          any amendment to the  respective  FCC SEC Report),  complied (and with
          respect to FCC SEC Reports  filed after the date hereof,  will comply)
          as to form in all material  respects with the applicable  requirements
          of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "<U>1933 Act</U>"), and
          the  Securities  Exchange  Act  of  1934,  as  amended  (the  "<U>1934</U>
          <U>Act</U>"), and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.

     (b)  Each  of  the  financial  statements  (including  the  related  notes)
          included or incorporated by reference in the FCC SEC Reports  presents
          fairly, in all material respects,  the consolidated financial position
          and  consolidated  results of operations and cash flows of FCC and its
          consolidated  subsidiaries  as of the  respective  dates  or  for  the
          respective  periods set forth therein,  all in conformity  with United
          States generally accepted accounting  principles ("<U>GAAP</U>") consistently
          applied during the periods involved except as otherwise noted therein,
          and subject, in the case of the unaudited interim financial statements
          of FCC, to the absence of notes and normal year-end  adjustments  that
          have not been and are not expected to be material in amount. Except as
          disclosed in the FCC SEC Reports filed and publicly available prior to
          the  date  hereof  (the  "<U>FCC  Filed  SEC   Reports</U>"),   FCC  and  its
          subsidiaries  have not incurred any  liabilities  that are of a nature
          that would be required to be disclosed  on a balance  sheet of FCC and
          its subsidiaries or the footnotes  thereto prepared in conformity with
          GAAP,  other than (A)  liabilities  incurred in the ordinary course of
          business, (B) liabilities incurred in accordance with Section 4.01, or
          (C)  liabilities  that,  individually  or in the aggregate,  would not
          reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on FCC.


Section 2.05 <U>Information Supplied</U>. The information supplied by FCC for inclusion
or  incorporated  by  reference in (A) the  Schedule  13E-3 or any  amendment or
supplement  thereto will not contain any untrue  statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material  fact  required to be stated  therein or necessary in
order to make the statements  therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading,  and (B) the Proxy Statement or any amendment or
supplement  thereto  to be sent  to the  Shareholders  in  connection  with  the
Shareholders'  Meeting will not, on the date the Proxy Statement is first mailed
to the  Shareholders  or at the  time  of the  Shareholders'  Meeting  or at the
Effective Time, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material  fact  required to be stated  therein or necessary in order to make
the  statements  therein,  in light of the  circumstances  under which they were
made, not misleading.  The Proxy Statement and the Schedule 13E-3 will comply as
to form in all material  respects with the  requirements of the 1934 Act and the
1933  Act  and  the  regulations  promulgated  thereunder.  Notwithstanding  the
foregoing, no representation or warranty is made with respect to statements made
or  incorporated by reference in the Schedule 13E-3 or the Proxy Statement based
on information supplied by or on behalf of UTG for inclusion or incorporation by
reference.

Section 2.06 <U>Absence of Changes or Events</U>.  Except for liabilities  permitted to
be incurred in accordance with this Agreement or the  transactions  contemplated
hereby,  since December 31, 2000, FCC and its subsidiaries  have conducted their
business  only in the  ordinary  course  and in a manner  consistent  with  past
practice  and,  since  December  31,  2000,  there  have not  been any  changes,
circumstances  or events which,  individually or in the aggregate,  have had, or
would reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect on FCC

          asset of FCC or any  subsidiary of FCC which,  individually  or in the
          aggregate,  would  reasonably  be expected to have a Material  Adverse
          Effect  on FCC,  nor are there any  judgments,  decrees,  injunctions,
          rules or orders  of any  Governmental  Entity  (as  defined  below) or
          arbitrator  outstanding  against FCC or any  subsidiary  of FCC which,
          individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have
          a Material Adverse Effect on FCC. As used in this Agreement,  the term
          "<U>Governmental   Entity</U>"   shall   include  any   supranational,
          national,   state,  municipal,   local  or  foreign  government,   any
          instrumentality,   subdivision,   court,   administrative   agency  or
          commission or other authority thereof,  or any  quasi-governmental  or
          private body  exercising any  regulatory,  taxing,  importing or other
          governmental or quasi-governmental authority.

     (b)  Except as,  individually or in the aggregate,  would not reasonably be
          expected  to  have a  Material  Adverse  Effect  on  FCC,  FCC and its
          subsidiaries  hold  all  permits,  licenses,  franchises,   variances,
          exemptions,  orders and approvals of all  Governmental  Entities which
          are  necessary  for  the  operation  of the  businesses  as now  being

          <U>Permits</U>"), and no suspension or cancellation of any of the FCC Permits
          is  pending  or,  to the  knowledge  of FCC,  threatened.  FCC and its
          subsidiaries  are in  compliance  with the  terms of the FCC  Permits,
          except  where  the  failure  to so  comply,  individually  or  in  the
          aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
          Effect on FCC.  Neither FCC nor its  subsidiaries  is in violation of,

          individually or in the aggregate,  would not reasonably be expected to

          subsidiaries) is duly qualified and in good standing to do business in
          each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the ownership
