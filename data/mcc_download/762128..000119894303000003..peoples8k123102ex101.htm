during the Term and the Restricted Period (as defined below).&nbsp; Morthland acknowledges and recognizes the highly competitive nature of the businesses of the Company and the Bank and accordingly Morthland agrees as follows:</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the Term (the &ldquo;Restricted Period&rdquo;), Morthland will not, whether on his own behalf or on behalf of or in conjunction with any person, firm,
partnership, joint venture, association, corporation or other business organization, entity or enterprise whatsoever (&ldquo;Person&rdquo;), directly or indirectly engage in, or acquire an interest in, any commercial banking business in any of the eight counties in

provisions of this Section 4(a).</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Morthland may directly or indirectly own, solely as an investment, securities of any Person which are
publicly traded on a national or regional stock exchange or on the over-the-counter market if he (A) is not a controlling person of, or a member of a group which controls, such Person and (B) does not, directly or indirectly, own 5% or more of any class of securities
of such Person.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the Restricted Period, Morthland will not, whether on his own behalf or on behalf of or in conjunction with any Person, directly or indirectly:</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;employ or seek to employ any person or agent who then is employed by the Company, its subsidiaries or affiliates.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is expressly understood and agreed that although Morthland and the Company consider the restrictions contained in this Section 4(a) to be reasonable, if a
final determination is made by a court of competent jurisdiction or an arbitrator that the time or territory or any other restriction contained in this Agreement is an unenforceable restriction against Morthland, the provisions of this Agreement shall not be rendered
void but shall be deemed amended to apply as to such maximum time and territory and to such maximum extent as such court or arbitrator may determine or indicate to be enforceable. Alternatively, if any court of competent jurisdiction or arbitrator finds that any
restriction contained in this Agreement is unenforceable, and such restriction cannot be amended so as to make it enforceable, such finding shall not affect the enforceability of any of the other restrictions contained herein.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Confidentiality.</u>&nbsp; Morthland will not at any time use, divulge, convey or publish any secret or confidential information, knowledge or data of the Company, the
Bank, its subsidiaries or affiliates, including information, knowledge or data of third parties as to which the Company, its subsidiaries or affiliates are under an obligation of confidentiality (such as confidential customer financial information), obtained by
Morthland in the course of his activities under this Agreement except where required to do so by a court of law, by a governmental agency having supervisory authority over the business of the Company, its subsidiaries or affiliates, or by any administrative or
legislative body with jurisdiction over Morthland.&nbsp; Such confidential information does not include information, knowledge or data that becomes publicly known other than through a breach of this Agreement by Morthland.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Specific Performance</u>.&nbsp; Morthland acknowledges and agrees that the remedies of the Company and the Bank at law for a breach of any of the provisions of Section 4
would be inadequate and the Company and the Bank would suffer irreparable damages as a result of such breach.&nbsp; In the event of such a breach by Morthland, the Company and the Bank, as their sole remedy, shall be entitled to bring an action in any court of
competent jurisdiction for equitable relief in the form of specific performance, temporary restraining order, temporary or permanent injunction or any other equitable remedy which may then be available, but shall not be entitled to cease making any payment or to
cease providing any benefit required by this Agreement; provided that, in the event of a breach by Morthland of Sections 4(a)(i) or (iii) which is continuing after Morthland's actual receipt of the Company's 30 days' written notice to cease and desist such breach,
the Company or the Bank shall be permitted to recover actual damages not to exceed the scheduled payments under Section 2(a) remaining from the date of breach, or if the breach occurs after all such payments have been received, not to exceed the amount of the last
scheduled payment.</font></p>
