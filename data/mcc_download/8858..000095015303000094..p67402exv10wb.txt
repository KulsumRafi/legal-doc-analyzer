            Securitization Subsidiary in favor of Avnet, each of which shall
            immediately thereupon become Effective Collateral."

            (f) Section 6.21(b) of the Credit Agreement shall be amended and
restated in its entirety as follows:

                  "(b) Avnet shall execute and deliver or cause to be executed

            Attorney Costs incurred or to be incurred by it through the
            completion of the post-closing matters contemplated by the Second
            Amendment (provided that such estimate shall not thereafter preclude

            others having an interest in such real property, together with such
            other documents and agreements, as the Administrative Agent may

            Escrow, provided that no Trigger Event shall have occurred. If there
            shall have occurred any Trigger Event prior to any such delivery
            date, each of the foregoing documents not yet delivered into
            Document Escrow shall be executed and delivered immediately to the

            shall be entitled to advice of counsel and other consultants or
            experts concerning all matters pertaining to such duties. The
            Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or
            misconduct of any agent or attorney-in-fact that it selects in the
            absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct. Any such agent,

            Section 8.02, shall have all the benefits and immunities provided to
            the Administrative Agent in this Article VIII with respect to any

            to such acts or omissions."

            (k) Section 8.09 of the Credit Agreement shall be amended and
restated in its entirety as follows:

                  "8.09 SUCCESSOR ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT. The Administrative Agent
            may resign as Administrative Agent upon 30 days' notice to the
            Lenders; provided that any such resignation by Bank of America shall
            also constitute its resignation as L/C Issuer, Swing Line Lender,
            and document escrow agent under the Document Escrow. If the
            Administrative Agent resigns under this Agreement, the Required
            Lenders shall appoint from among the Lenders a successor
            administrative agent for the Lenders which successor administrative
            agent shall be consented to by Avnet at all times other than during
            the existence of an Event of Default (which consent of Avnet shall
            not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). If no successor
            administrative agent is appointed prior to the effective date of the
            resignation of the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent
            may appoint, after consulting with the Lenders and Avnet, a
            successor administrative agent from among the Lenders. Upon the
            acceptance of its appointment as successor administrative agent
            hereunder, the Person acting as such successor administrative agent
            shall succeed to all the rights, powers and duties of the retiring
            Administrative Agent, L/C Issuer and Swing Line Lender including
            those under the Document Escrow and the Receivables Intercreditor
            Agreement and the respective terms "Administrative Agent," "L/C
            Issuer" and "Swing Line Lender" shall mean such successor
            administrative agent, letter of credit issuer and swing line lender,

            L/C Issuer's and Swing Line Lender's rights, powers and duties as
            such shall be terminated (provided that the retiring Administrative
            Agent, L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender, as the case may be, shall
            retain all rights



                                       6

            then existing under Sections 8.07 and 9.05), without any other or
            further act or deed on the part of such retiring L/C Issuer or Swing
            Line Lender or any other Lender other than the obligation of the
            successor L/C Issuer to issue letters of credit in substitution for
            the Letters of Credit, if any, outstanding at the time of such
            succession. Immediately upon retiring as Administrative Agent, the
            Administrative Agent shall no longer have any responsibilities under
            any Collateral Documents or the Receivables Intercreditor Agreement
            and any successor administrative agent shall immediately be deemed
            to undertake all responsibilities related to the Collateral
            Documents and the Receivables Intercreditor Agreement upon
            appointment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, after any retiring
            Administrative Agent's resignation hereunder as Administrative
            Agent, the provisions of this Article VIII and Sections 9.04 and
            9.05 shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted
            to be taken by it while it was Administrative Agent under this
            Agreement. If no successor administrative agent has accepted
            appointment as Administrative Agent by the date which is 30 days
            following a retiring Administrative Agent's notice of resignation,
            the retiring Administrative Agent's resignation shall nevertheless
            thereupon become effective and the Lenders shall perform all of the
            duties of the Administrative Agent hereunder until such time, if
            any, as the Required Lenders appoint a successor agent as provided
            for above, in which event the Lenders shall be deemed to have
            assumed all such rights, powers and duties of the Administrative
            Agent as aforesaid."

            (l) Section 8.11(a) of the Credit Agreement shall be amended and
restated in its entirety as follows:

                  "8.11 COLLATERAL MATTERS.

                  (a) Each Lender authorizes and directs the Administrative
            Agent to enter into the Collateral Documents (including as document
            escrow agent under the Springing Lien Escrow Agreement) and agrees
            that any action taken by the Administrative Agent concerning any
            Collateral (with the consent or at the request of the Required
            Lenders or in accordance with any Loan Document), that the
            Administrative Agent's exercise of powers concerning the Collateral
            in any Loan Document, and that all other reasonably incidental
            powers, are authorized and binding upon all Lenders. Each Lender
            authorizes and directs the Administrative Agent to enter into and to
            perform the duties and obligations of the "Lender Agent" under the
            Receivables Intercreditor Agreement."

either immediately prior to or after giving effect to this Amendment.

            (b) The execution, delivery and performance by Avnet of this
Amendment have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate and other action
and do not and will not require any registration with, consent or approval of,
notice to or action by, any Person (including any Governmental Authority) in
order to be effective and enforceable. The Credit Agreement as amended by this
Amendment constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligations of Avnet,
enforceable against it in accordance with its respective terms, without defense,
counterclaim or offset.

            (c) All representations and warranties of Avnet contained in Article
V of the Credit Agreement as amended hereby are true and correct as of the
Effective Date, except to the extent that such representations and warranties
specifically refer to an earlier date, in which case they are true and correct
as of such earlier date.

            (d) Avnet is entering into this Amendment on the basis of its own
investigation and for its own reasons, without reliance upon the Administrative
Agent, the Lenders or any other Person.

            (e) As of the Effective Date, there are no Designated Borrowers
under the Credit Agreement.

      4. Effective Date. This Amendment will become effective as of the date
shown first above, provided each of the following conditions precedent has been
satisfied (the "Effective Date"):

            (a) The Administrative Agent shall have received from each of Avnet
and the Required Lenders a duly executed original (or, if elected by the
Administrative Agent, an executed facsimile copy) counterpart to this Amendment.

            (b) The Administrative Agent shall have received from the secretary
or assistant secretary of Avnet a certificate providing satisfactory evidence of
the authorization of

                                       8
<PAGE>
the execution, delivery and performance by Avnet of this Amendment and any other
documents contemplated hereby.

            (c) The Administrative Agent shall have received from Avnet a
certificate executed by a Responsible Officer of Avnet, dated as of the
Effective Date and certifying that (i) all representations and warranties
contained herein are true and correct on and as of the Effective Date as though
made on and as of such date and (ii) on and as of the Effective Date, no event
has occurred which has or would reasonably be likely to have a material adverse
effect on the business, assets, liabilities (actual or contingent), operations,
condition (financial or otherwise) or prospects of Avnet or of Avnet and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole, or on the facts and information regarding Avnet
and its Subsidiaries as represented as of the date hereof.

            (d) The Administrative Agent shall have received satisfactory
evidence that Avnet has paid (i) all Attorney Costs of the Administrative Agent
to the extent invoiced prior to the Effective Date (including any previously
invoiced and outstanding Attorney Costs that relate to services previously
provided), plus such additional amounts of Attorney Costs as shall constitute
the Administrative Agent's reasonable estimate of Attorney Costs incurred or to
be incurred by it through the Effective Date (provided that such estimate shall
not thereafter preclude a final settling of accounts between Avnet and the
Administrative Agent) and (ii) all other reasonable out-of-pocket costs and
expenses of the Administrative Agent in connection with the negotiation,
preparation, execution and delivery of this Amendment and any other documents to
be delivered in connection herewith.

            (e) The Administrative Agent shall have received, in form and
substance satisfactory to it, such additional approvals, consents, opinions,
documents and other information as the Administrative Agent may request.

            (f) The Effective Date shall have occurred no later than November
25, 2002.

For purposes of determining compliance with the conditions specified in this
Section 4, each Lender that has executed this Amendment and delivered it to the
Administrative Agent shall be deemed to have consented to, approved or accepted,
or to be satisfied with, each document or other matter either sent, or made
available for inspection, by the Administrative Agent to such Lender for
consent, approval, acceptance or satisfaction, or required thereunder to be
consented to or approved by or acceptable or satisfactory to such Lender.

      5. Reservation of Rights. Avnet acknowledges and agrees that the execution
and delivery by the Administrative Agent and the Required Lenders of this
Amendment shall not (a) be deemed to create a course of dealing or otherwise
obligate the Administrative Agent or any Lender to execute similar amendments
under the same or similar circumstances in the future or (b) be deemed to create
any implied waiver of any right or remedy of the Administrative Agent or any
Lender with respect to any term or provision of any Loan Document.

      6. Miscellaneous.

            (a) Except as herein expressly amended, all terms, covenants and
provisions of the Credit Agreement are and shall remain in full force and effect
and all references therein to such Credit Agreement shall henceforth refer to
the Credit Agreement as amended by this

                                       9
<PAGE>
Amendment. This Amendment shall be deemed incorporated into, and a part of, the
Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement, as amended hereby, is hereby ratified by
Avnet.

            (b) This Amendment shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of
the parties hereto and thereto and their respective successors and assigns. No
third party beneficiaries are intended in connection with this Amendment.

            (c) THIS AMENDMENT IS SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF SECTIONS 9.19 AND
9.20 OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, THE PROVISIONS OF WHICH ARE BY THIS REFERENCE
HEREBY INCORPORATED HEREIN IN FULL.

            (d) This Amendment may be executed in any number of counterparts,
each of which shall be deemed an original, but all such counterparts together
shall constitute but one and the same instrument. Each of the parties hereto
understands and agrees that this document (and any other document required
herein) may be delivered by any party thereto either in the form of an executed
original or an executed original sent by facsimile transmission to be followed
promptly by mailing of a hard copy original, and that receipt by the
Administrative Agent of a facsimile transmitted document purportedly bearing the
signature of a Lender or Avnet shall bind such Lender or Avnet, respectively,
with the same force and effect as the delivery of a hard copy original. Any
failure by the Administrative Agent to receive the hard copy executed original
of such document shall not diminish the binding effect of receipt of the
facsimile transmitted executed original of such document of the party whose hard
copy page was not received by the Administrative Agent.

            (e) This Amendment, together with the Credit Agreement, contains the
entire and exclusive agreement of the parties hereto with reference to the
matters discussed herein and therein. This Amendment supersedes all prior drafts
and communications with respect thereto. This Amendment may not be amended
except in accordance with the provisions of Section 9.01 of the Credit
Agreement.

            (f) If any term or provision of this Amendment shall be deemed
prohibited by or invalid under any applicable law, such provision shall be
invalidated without affecting the remaining provisions of this Amendment or the
Credit Agreement, respectively.

            (g) Avnet covenants to pay to or reimburse the Administrative Agent,
upon demand, for all out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in connection
with the development, preparation, negotiation, execution and delivery of this
Amendment and the other documents contemplated hereby.

            (h) This Amendment shall constitute a Loan Document.
