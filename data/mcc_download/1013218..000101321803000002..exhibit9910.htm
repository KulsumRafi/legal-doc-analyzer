</B><P ALIGN="CENTER"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;</P>
<p>THIS MASTER LEASE AGREEMENT (this &quot;<B>Lease</B>&quot;) is made effective as of December&nbsp;15, 2002, by and between <B>KANSAS-LTC CORPORATION</B>, formerly known as Coronado Corporation, a Delaware corporation (&quot;<B>Lessor</B>&quot;), and <B>ALTERRA HEALTHCARE CORPORATION</B>, a Delaware corporation (&quot;<B>Lessee</B>&quot;), subject to the terms, conditions and contingencies set forth below.</P>
<B><U><P ALIGN="CENTER">RECITALS</P>
</B></U><p>WHEREAS Lessor is the holder of certain leasehold estates (&quot;<B>Leasehold Estates</B>&quot;) pursuant to the Master Leases (defined below) covering certain real property and improvements (as more particularly defined below, the &quot;<B>Facilities</B>&quot;), and desires to sublease its interest in the Leasehold Estates and the Facilities to Lessee pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Lease; and</P>
<p>WHEREAS it the parties' intention to set forth their respective covenants and obligations in a single agreement, not merely as matter of convenience, but because the leasing of the four (4) Facilities as an inseparable unit is a special and essential inducement to Lessor to enter into this transaction, and but for the leasing of the four (4) Facilities together as an inseparable whole, Lessor would not have entered into this Lease; and</P>
<p>WHEREAS the parties agree and acknowledge that the amount set forth as Minimum Rent (defined below) is calculated on the basis of leasing of the four (4) Facilities together as a single, inseparable group and is non-allocable among the four (4) Facilities, and that it would be impossible to allocate to any one or more of the Facilities a divisible portion of the Minimum Rent.</P>
<B><p>NOW THEREFORE,</B> in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements contained herein, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt, sufficiency and mutuality of which are hereby acknowledged, it is agreed as follows:</P>

</B><I><U><p>Minimum Rent</I></U>.  Lessee will pay to Lessor in lawful money of the United States of America which shall be legal tender for the payment of public and private debts at Lessor's address set forth in <B><U>Article XXXI</B></U> or at such other place or to such other person, firms or corporations as Lessor from time to time may designate in a Notice, Minimum Rent (as defined below), during the Term, as follows:</P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Initial Term</U><I>.</I>  The initial annual &quot;<B>Minimum Rent</B>&quot; payable hereunder shall be Seven Hundred Fifteen Thousand Nine Hundred Thirty One and 23/100 Dollars ($715,931.23), payable in equal monthly installments of Fifty Nine Thousand Six Hundred Sixty and 94/100 Dollars ($59,660.94) on the first (1<SUP>st</SUP>) calendar day of each calendar month of the Term.  If necessary, Minimum Rent shall be prorated for any partial month at the beginning or end of the Term.</P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Annual Escalation of Minimum Rent</U>.  Commencing on the one-year anniversary of the Commencement Date (if the Commencement Date is the first (1<SUP>st</SUP>) day of a calendar month, or, if not, on the first (1<SUP>st</SUP>) day of the first (1<SUP>st</SUP>) full month following the Commencement Date), and continuing on each subsequent one-year anniversary thereof during the Term (including any Extended Term) (each, an &quot;<B>Adjustment Date</B>&quot;), the Minimum Rent (irrespective of any prorations made pursuant to <B><U>Section 3.1(a)</B></U> above) shall increase to an amount equal to the Minimum Rent for the one-year period immediately preceding the Adjustment Date multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the C.P.I. (defined below) for the month in which the Adjustment Date occurs, and the denominator of which shall be the C.P.I. for the month that was one year prior to the Adjustment Date; provided, however, that the product of said multiplication shall not result in an increase of the Minimum Rent by more than two percent (2%) per year on a cumulative basis (&quot;<B>Annual Multiplier</B>&quot;).  If, however, the Annual Multiplier is less than two percent (2%) on any Adjustment Date (a &quot;<B>Less Than 2% Adjustment Date</B>&quot;), then at such time as the Annual Multiplier is determined for subsequent Adjustment Dates, the Minimum Rent for each Less Than 2% Adjustment Date shall be retroactively recalculated such that subsequent Annual Multipliers (whether less than or greater than 2%) shall be first applied to increase the Annual Multiplier for each Less Than 2% Adjustment Date to an amount up to, but not greater than, 2%, with such recalculations to be made in chronological order beginning with the earliest Less Than 2% Adjustment Date and continuing, so long as there is Annual Multiplier remaining, until recalculations have been made with respect to all Less Than 2% Adjustment Dates.  After each such recalculation has been made, the shortfall in the Minimum Rent for the newly recalculated Less Than 2% Adjustment Dates shall be billed to Lessee and Lessee shall pay such shortfall amount to Lessor together with the next payment of Minimum Rent otherwise coming due hereunder.  Such recalculations and shortfall billings shall be made on each Adjustment Date where there remain prior Less Than 2% Adjustment Dates which have not yet been recalculated to 2%.  For purposes of example only, if the Commencement Date is June 1, 2002 and the initial Minimum Rent equals $1,020,000, and if (a)&nbsp;the C.P.I. increased 1.5% as of June 1, 2003, the Minimum Rent as of June 1, 2003 would increase to $1,035,300; (b)&nbsp;the C.P.I. increased 1.5% as of June 1, 2004, the Minimum Rent as of June 1, 2004 would increase to $1,050,830; (c)&nbsp;the C.P.I. increased 6% as of June 1, 2005, the Minimum Rent as of June 1, 2005 would increase to $1,082,354, which is the Minimum Rent increased by 2% per year for three years (i.e. the average annual increases have been 3% (1.5% + 1.5% + 6% for the three years, respectively) subject to the 2% annual limitation), and the total shortfall amount to be billed to Lessee would be $5,100 for the 2003 Adjustment Date and $10,378 for the 2004 Adjustment Date.  The &quot;overage&quot; in the C.P.I. increase (i.e., the remaining 3% increase that could not be applied towards the increase in Minimum Rent on June 1, 2005 by virtue of the 2% cap), would be &quot;banked&quot; and would be used to increase Minimum Rent in subsequent years if the C.P.I. increase in such years were less than 2%.  By way of demonstration, if the C.P.I. as of June 1, 2006 and June 1, 2007 do not increase at all, then Minimum Rent would nonetheless increase by 2% on June 1, 2006, and 1% on June 1, 2007 (such increases having been &quot;banked&quot; from the remaining portion of the 6% C.P.I. increase on June 1, 2005).  &quot;<B>C.P.I.</B>&quot; shall mean and refer to the Consumer Price Index of the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the Department of Labor, U.S. Cities Average, All Items (1982-84=100); provided that if compilation of the C.P.I. is discontinued or transferred to any other governmental department or bureau, then the index most nearly the same as the C.P.I. shall be used.  If Lessor is unable to determine the C.P.I. by any Adjustment Date, Lessee shall continue to pay the Minimum Rent at the rate paid for the period immediately prior to that Adjustment Date, and once the C.P.I. for that Adjustment Date is published, the new Minimum Rent (as increased by the Annual Multiplier) shall be effective retroactively as of such Adjustment Date and the aggregate amount of any additional Minimum Rent shall be paid by Lessee promptly after written notice thereof from Lessor (but not later than the date of the next monthly installment of Minimum Rent, unless the next installment falls due within five (5) days after Lessor's notice, in which case not later than the date of the second next monthly installment of Minimum Rent).  No delay by Lessor in providing notice of any such increase in Minimum Rent shall be deemed a waiver of Lessor's right to increase the Minimum Rent as provided hereunder.</P>

3.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<I><U>Additional Charges</U>.  </I>In addition to Minimum Rent, (1) Lessee, subject to its rights under <B><U>Article XII</B></U>, will also pay and discharge as and when due and payable all other amounts, liabilities, obligations and Impositions which Lessee assumes or agrees to pay under this Lease, including but not limited to those set forth in <B><U>Articles IX</B></U> and <B><U>XIII</B></U>, below, and (2) in the event of any failure on the part of Lessee to pay any of those items referred to in clause (1) above, Lessee will also promptly pay and discharge every fine, penalty, interest and cost which may be added for non-payment or late payment of such items (the items referred to in clauses (1) and (2) above being referred to herein collectively as the &quot;<B>Additional Charges</B>&quot;), and Lessor shall have all legal equitable and contractual rights, powers and remedies provided either in this Lease or by statute or otherwise in the case of nonpayment of the Additional Charges.  If any elements of Additional Charges are not be paid within seven (7) Business Days after due (after taking into account applicable time periods during which Lessee may contest the Additional Charges under <B><U>Article XII</B></U>) and Lessor pays any such amount (which Lessor shall have the right, but not the obligation to do), then, in addition to Lessor's other rights and remedies, Lessee will pay Lessor on demand, as Additional Charges, interest on such unpaid Additional Charges computed at the Overdue Rate from the due date of such installment to the date of Lessee's payment thereof.  To the extent that Lessee pays any Additional Charges directly to Lessor (as opposed to the applicable third party payee) pursuant to any requirement of this Lease, Lessee shall be relieved of its obligation to pay such Additional Charges to the entity to which they would otherwise be due, and within than three (3) Business Days after its receipt, Lessor shall remit such payment(s) to the entity to which such payment(s) is due .</P>

<I><U>Net Lease</U>.  </I>Notwithstanding any provisions in this Lease to the contrary (except with respect to Lessee's rights set forth in <B><U>Article V</B></U>), Minimum Rent shall be paid absolutely net to Lessor, so that this Lease shall yield to Lessor the full amount of the installments of Minimum Rent throughout the Term, all as more fully set forth in <B><U>Articles IV, IX and XIII</B></U>, and other provisions of this Lease. </P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
3.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<U><i>Non-Allocable Minimum Rent</U>.  </I>Notwithstanding any language contained in this Lease to the contrary, the parties agree and acknowledge that the amount set forth as Minimum Rent is calculated on the basis of leasing of all four (4) Facilities together as a single, inseparable group and is non-allocable among the four (4) Facilities. <I> </I>Further notwithstanding any language contained in this Lease to the contrary, the parties further agree and acknowledge that it would be impossible to allocate to any one or more of the Facilities a divisible portion of the Minimum Rent.  Further notwithstanding any language contained in this Lease to the contrary, Lessee agrees and acknowledges that the leasing of the four (4) Facilities as an inseparable whole was accepted by Lessor as a special and essential inducement to enter into this transaction, and but for Lessee's agreement to lease all four (4) Facilities as an inseparable whole, Lessor would not have entered into this Lease.</P>

3.5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I><U>Late Charge</I></U>.  LESSEE HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT LATE PAYMENT BY LESSEE TO LESSOR OF RENT (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION MINIMUM RENT) WILL CAUSE LESSOR TO INCUR COSTS NOT CONTEMPLATED BY THIS LEASE, THE EXACT AMOUNT OF WHICH WILL BE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO ASCERTAIN.  SUCH COSTS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, PROCESSING AND ACCOUNTING CHARGES.  ACCORDINGLY, IF ANY INSTALLMENT OF RENT SHALL NOT BE RECEIVED BY LESSOR WITHIN SEVEN (7) BUSINESS DAYS AFTER SUCH AMOUNT SHALL BE DUE, THEN WITHOUT ANY REQUIREMENT FOR NOTICE TO LESSEE, LESSEE SHALL PAY TO LESSOR A LATE CHARGE EQUAL TO FIVE PERCENT (5%) OF SUCH OVERDUE AMOUNT.  THE PARTIES HEREBY AGREE THAT SUCH LATE CHARGE REPRESENTS A FAIR AND REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF THE COSTS LESSOR WILL INCUR BY REASON OF LATE PAYMENT BY LESSEE.  ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH LATE CHARGE BY LESSOR SHALL IN NO EVENT CONSTITUTE A WAIVER OF LESSEE'S DEFAULT OR BREACH WITH RESPECT TO ANY UNPAID OVERDUE AMOUNTS, NOR PREVENT LESSOR FROM EXERCISING ANY OF THE OTHER RIGHTS AND REMEDIES GRANTED UNDER THIS LEASE, AT LAW OR IN EQUITY.

Lessee, at its expense, shall, to the extent required or permitted by Legal Requirements, prepare and file all tax returns and reports in respect of any Imposition as may be required by governmental authorities.  Any refund due from any taxing authority in respect of any Imposition shall be paid over to or retained by Lessee provided no Event of Default then exists, but if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, such refund shall be paid over to Lessor, and Lessee hereby authorizes Lessor to accept any such refunds directly, and hereby authorizes any such taxing authority to pay such amounts directly to Lessor upon receipt of written instructions to do so together with a statement by Lessor that an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing.  Any such funds retained by Lessor due to an Event of Default shall be applied as provided in <B><U>Article XVI</B></U>. Lessor and Lessee shall, upon request of the other, provide such data as is maintained by the party to whom the request is made with respect to the Leased Property as may be necessary to prepare any required returns and reports. In the event governmental authorities classify any property covered by this Lease as personal property, Lessee shall file personal property tax returns in such jurisdictions where required. Lessor, to the extent it possesses the same, and Lessee, to the extent it possesses the same, will provide the other party, upon request, with cost and depreciation records necessary for filing returns for any property so classified as personal property.  Where Lessor is legally required to file personal property tax returns, Lessee will be provided with copies of assessment notices indicating a value in excess of the reported value in sufficient time for Lessee to file a protest.  Lessee may, upon notice to Lessor, at Lessee's option and at Lessee's sole cost and expense, protest, appeal or institute such other proceedings as Lessee may deem appropriate to effect a reduction of real estate or personal property assessments and Lessor, at Lessee's expenses as aforesaid, shall reasonably cooperate with Lessee in such protest, appeal, or other action, provided that Lessee may not withhold payments pending such challenges except under the conditions set forth in <B><U>Article XII</B></U>.  Billings for reimbursement by Lessee to Lessor of personal property taxes shall be accompanied by copies of a bill therefor and payments thereof which identify the personal property with respect to which such payments are made. </P>

However, notwithstanding the foregoing, it shall be Lessee's sole duty to inquire and determine all of the Impositions for which it is liable as provided herein and shall promptly pay such Impositions when due, and Lessor shall have no duty of inquiry concerning Impositions.</P>

Upon the reasonable request of Lessor, Lessee shall provide to Lessor reasonable security satisfactory to Lessor to assure the payment of all Claims which may be assessed against the Leased Property together with interest and penalties, if any, thereon. Lessor agrees to join in any such proceedings (at Lessee's sole cost and expense) if the same be required to legally prosecute such contest of the validity of such Claims; provided, however, that Lessor shall not thereby be subjected to any liability for the payment of any costs or expenses in connection with any proceedings brought by Lessee; and Lessee shall indemnify and save harmless Lessor from any such costs or expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred by Lessor.  In the event that Lessee fails to pay any Claims when due or, upon Lessor's request, to provide the security therefor as provided in this <B><U>Article XII</B></U> and to diligently prosecute any contest of the same, Lessor may, upon thirty (30) days advance written Notice to Lessee, pay such charges together with any interest and penalties and the same shall be repayable to Lessee to Lessor at the next Payment Date provided for in this Lease.  Provided, however, that should Lessor reasonably determine that the giving of such Notice would risk loss to the Leased Property or impair the value of the Leased Property or in any way cause damage to Lessor, then Lessor shall give such written Notice as is practical under the circumstances.  Lessee shall be entitled to any refund of any Claims and such charges and penalties or interest thereon which have been paid by Lessee or paid by Lessor and for which Lessor has been fully reimbursed. </P>

Each policy shall, subject to Lessor's (or a Facility Mortgagee's) approval, contain (i)&nbsp;a replacement cost endorsement, without deduction for depreciation, (ii)&nbsp;either an agreed amount endorsement or a waiver of any co-insurance provisions, and (iii)&nbsp;an ordinance or law coverage or enforcement endorsement if the Improvements or the use of the Property constitutes any legal nonconforming structures or uses, and shall provide for deductibles in such amounts as Lessor (or a Facility Mortgagee) may permit in its sole discretion.; </P>

<I><U>Form Satisfactory, etc</U>.  </I>All of the policies of insurance referred to in this <B><U>Article XIII</B></U> shall be written in a form reasonably satisfactory to Lessor and by insurance companies reasonably satisfactory to Lessor (and, as applicable, any Facility Mortgagee).  Subject to the foregoing, Lessor agrees that it will not unreasonably withhold or delay its approval as to the form of the policies of insurance or as to the insurance companies selected by Lessee.  Lessee shall pay all of the premiums therefor, and deliver such policies or certificates thereof to Lessor prior to their effective date (and, with respect to any renewal policy, prior to the expiration of the existing policy), and in the event of the failure of Lessee either to effect such insurance as herein called for or to pay the premiums therefor, or to deliver such policies or certificates thereof to Lessor at the times required, Lessor shall be entitled, but shall have no obligation, to effect such insurance and pay the premiums therefor, which premiums shall be repayable by Lessee to Lessor upon written demand therefor, and failure to repay the same shall constitute an Event of Default within the meaning of <B><U>Section 16.1</B></U>.  Each insurer mentioned in this <B><U>Article XIII</B></U> shall agree, by endorsement on the policy or policies issued by it, or by independent instrument furnished to Lessor, that it will give to Lessor (and to any Facility Mortgagee, if required by the same) thirty (30) days' written notice before the policy or policies in questions shall be altered, allowed to expire or canceled. </P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
13.6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<I><U>Increase in Limits</U>.  </I>In the event that a Facility Mortgagee shall at any time reasonably determine the limits of the personal injury or property damage, or public liability insurance then carried to be insufficient, Lessee shall thereafter carry the insurance with increased limits until further change pursuant to the provisions of this Section; provided that if Lessor desires to increase the limits of insurance, and such is not pursuant to the request of a Facility Mortgagee, then Lessor may not demand an increase in limits above the limits generally consistent with the requirements of owners of long term care properties in the state in which the applicable Facility is located.</P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
13.7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<I><U>Blanket Policy</U>.  </I>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this <B><U>Article XIII</B></U>, Lessee's obligations to carry the insurance provided for herein may be brought within the coverage of a so-called blanket policy or policies of insurance carried and maintained by Lessee; provided, however, that the coverage afforded Lessor will not be reduced or diminished or otherwise be different from that which would exist under a separate policy meeting all other requirements of this Lease by reason of the use of such blanket policy of insurance, and provided further that the requirements of this <B><U>Article XIII</B></U> shall be met in any such blanket policy. </P>

<I><U>No Separate Insurance</U>. </I>Lessee shall not on Lessee's own initiative or pursuant to the request or requirement of any third party take out separate insurance concurrent in form or contributing in the event of loss with that required in this Article, to be furnished or which may reasonably be required to be furnished, by Lessee or increase the amount of any then existing insurance by securing any additional policy or additional policies, unless all parties having an insurable interest in the subject matter of the insurance, including in all cases Lessor and all Facility Mortgagees are included therein as additional insureds, and the loss is payable under said insurance in the same manner as losses are payable under the Lease.  Lessee shall immediately notify Lessor of the taking out of any such separate insurance or of the increasing of any of the amount of the then existing insurance.</P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
13.9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<I><U>Continuous Coverage</U>.  </I>Prior to the Commencement Date, Lessee was the tenant and operator of the Leased Property, and prior to that, Lessee was the owner and operator of the Leased Property.  Therefore, Lessee already has in place insurance with respect to the Leased Property.  Lessee shall assure that there is no gap in the insurance coverage provided in connection with the Leased Property at or after the Commencement Date, and therefore, the insurance provided by Lessee shall be continuous, with the types and amounts of coverage, described herein to be applicable on the Commencement Date.  To the extent there is not full, complete and continuous coverage for all issues, no matter when arising, claimed or occurring, Lessee shall, at its sole cost, obtain such insurance.</P>

All proceeds payable by reason of any loss of or damage to the Leased Property, or any portion thereof, which is insured under any policy of insurance required by <B><U>Article XIII</B></U> of this Lease where the total proceeds paid by the insurer are equal to or in excess of $150,000.00 shall be paid to Lessor and held by Lessor in trust and shall be made available for reconstruction or repair, as the case may be, of any damage to or destruction of the Leased Property, or any portion thereof, and shall be paid out by Lessor from time-to-time for the reasonable costs of such reconstruction or repair.  Any excess proceeds of insurance remaining after the completion of the restoration or reconstruction of the Leased Property shall go to Lessee, provided the Lease is in force and there exists no uncured Event of Default; otherwise such excess shall be paid to Lessor for application as set forth in <B><U>Article XVI</B></U> hereof.  All insurance proceeds that are awarded and not applied to the restoration or repair of the Leased Property shall be retained by Lessor.  All salvage resulting from any risk covered by insurance shall belong to Lessor except that any salvage relating to Lessee's Personal Property shall belong to Lessee. </P>

If Lessee contributes such excess in cash, such excess shall be paid by Lessee to Lessor to be held in trust, together with any insurance proceeds, for application to the cost of repair and restoration. </P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
14.5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I><U>Restoration of Lessee's Property</U>.  </I>Without limiting Lessee's obligation to restore the Leased Property as provided in <B><U>Sections 14.2 and 14.3</B></U>, Lessee shall also restore all alterations and improvements made by Lessee, including Lessee's Personal Property but only to the extent that Lessee's Personal Property is necessary to the operation of the Leased Property for its Primary Intended Use in accordance with applicable Legal Requirements. </P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
14.6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<I><U>No Abatement of Rent</U>.  </I>This Lease shall remain in full force and effect and Lessee's obligation to make rental payments and to pay all other charges required by this Lease shall not be abated during the pendency of repair or restoration.</P>

Upon the termination of the Lease following a total Condemnation, all Rent (including, without limitation, Minimum Rent, Additional Rent and Additional Charges) paid or payable by Lessee hereunder shall be apportioned as of the date of termination.

Lessee further agrees that if any of the events described in <B><U>Sections 16(d) and (e)</B></U> should occur at anytime during the Term, Lessee shall affirm this Lease and all of its obligations as set forth hereunder.</P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
16.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I><U>Certain Remedies</U>.  </I>In addition to all of its rights under this Lease, Lessor shall have all remedies and rights provided in law and equity as a result of an Event of Default or Lessee's other breach under this Lease.  Without limiting the foregoing, if an Event of Default occurs (and the event giving rise to such Event of Default has not been cured within the curative period relating thereto as set forth in <B><U>Section 16.1</B></U> above) whether or not this Lease has been terminated pursuant to <B><U>Section 16.1</B></U>, Lessee shall, to the extent permitted by law, if required by Lessor so to do, immediately surrender to Lessor the Leased Property pursuant to the provisions of <B><U>Section 16.1</B></U> and quit the same and Lessor may enter upon and repossess the Leased Property by reasonable force, summary proceedings, ejectment or otherwise, and may remove Lessee and all other persons and any and all personal property from the Leased Property subject to rights of any residents or patients and to Legal Requirements. </P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
16.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<I><U>Damages</U>.  </I>Neither (a) the termination of this Lease pursuant to <B><U>Section&nbsp;16.1</B></U>, (b) the repossession of the Leased Property, nor (c) the failure of Lessor, notwithstanding reasonable good faith efforts, to relet the Leased Property, shall relieve Lessee of its liability and obligations hereunder, all of which shall survive any such termination, repossession or reletting. In the event of any such termination, Lessee shall forthwith pay to Lessor all Rent due and payable through and including the date of such termination. </P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Lessor shall not be deemed to have terminated this Lease unless Lessor delivers Notice to Lessee of such election.  If Lessee voluntarily elects to terminate this Lease, then in addition to all remedies available to Lessor, Lessor may recover the sum of: (i) the worth at the time of award of the unpaid Rent which had been earned at the time of termination; (ii) the worth at the time of award of the amount by which the unpaid Rent which would have been earned after termination until the time of award exceeds the amount of such rental loss that Lessee proves could have been reasonably avoided; (iii) the worth at the time of award of the amount by which the unpaid Rent for the balance of the Term after the time of award exceeds the amount of such rental loss that Lessee proves could be reasonably avoided, and (iv) any other amount necessary to compensate Lessor for all the detriment proximately caused by Lessee's failure to perform its obligations under this Lease or which in the ordinary course of things would be likely to result therefrom, including reasonable attorney fees, court costs and reasonable out-of-pocket expenses in the enforcement of Lessor's rights hereunder. </P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The &quot;worth at the time of award&quot; of the amounts referred to in subparagraphs (i) and (ii) above is computed by allowing interest at the maximum legal rate of interest permitted in accordance with the laws of the State of California.  The worth at the time of award of the amount referred to in subparagraph (iii) is computed by discounting such amount at the discount rate of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco at the time of award plus one percent (1%). </P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Without limiting Lessor's other remedies provided herein and provided by law, Lessor may continue the Lease in effect after Lessee's breach and abandonment and recover Rent as it becomes due, provided that, in such event, Lessee has the right to sublet or assign subject only to reasonable conditions imposed by Lessor.  Accordingly, without termination of Lessee's right to possession of the Leased Property, Lessor may demand and recover each installment of Rent and other sums payable by Lessee to Lessor under this Lease as the same becomes due and payable, which Rent and other sums shall bear interest at the maximum interest rate permitted in accordance with the laws of the State of California, from the date when due until paid, and Lessor may enforce, by action or otherwise, any other term or covenant of this Lease. </P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
16.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<I><U>Application of Funds</U>.  </I>Any payments received by Lessor under any of the provisions of this Lease during the existence or continuance of any Event of Default shall be applied to Lessee's obligations in the order which Lessor may determine or as may be prescribed by the laws of the State of California. </P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
16.5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I><U>Executory Contract</U>.  </I>Should Lessee file any proceeding under federal bankruptcy or other comparable federal or state insolvency laws, it shall, in addition to any other requirement under 11 U.S.C., Section 365 or other applicable provisions, be required to cure any and all obligations hereunder prior to being allowed to assume this Lease. </P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>17.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I><U>Lessor's Right to Cure Lessee's Default</U>.  </I>If Lessee fails to make any payment or to perform any act required to be made or performed under this Lease, and to cure the same within the relevant time periods provided in <B><U>Section 16.1</B></U>, Lessor, after thirty (30) days Notice to and demand upon Lessee, and without waiving or releasing any obligation of Lessee or default, may (but shall be under no obligation to) at any time thereafter make such payment or perform such act for the account and at the expense of Lessee, and may, to the extent permitted by law, enter upon the Leased Property for such purpose and take all such action thereon as, in Lessor's opinion, may be necessary or appropriate therefor.  Provided, however, that should Lessor reasonably determine that the giving of such Notice would risk loss to the Leased Property or cause damage to Lessor, then Lessor shall give such written Notice as is practical under the circumstances.  No such entry shall be deemed an eviction of Lessee.  In exercising any remedy under this <B><U>Article XVII</B></U>, Lessor shall use its good faith efforts not to violate any rights of residents of the applicable Facility.  All sums so paid by Lessor and all costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, in each case) so incurred, together with a late charge thereon (to the extent permitted by law) at the rate set forth in <B><U>Section&nbsp;3.5</B></U> above from the date on which such sums or expenses are paid or incurred by Lessor, shall be paid by Lessee to Lessor on demand.  The obligations of Lessee and rights of Lessee contained in this Article shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease. </P>

During such period of month-to-month tenancy, Lessee shall be obligated to perform and observe all of the terms, covenants and conditions of this Lease, but shall have no rights hereunder other than the right, to the extent given by law to month-to-month tenancies, to continue its occupancy and use of the Leased Property.  Nothing contained herein shall constitute the consent, express or implied, of Lessor to the holding over of Lessee after the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease. </P>

Without limiting the foregoing, Lessor shall not be liable for injury or damage to the person or goods, wares, merchandise or other property of Lessee, Lessee's employees, contractors, invitees, customers, or any other person in or about the Leased Property, whether such damage or injury is caused by or results from fire, steam, electricity, gas, water or rain, or from the breakage, leakage, obstruction or other defects of pipes, fire sprinklers, wires, appliances, plumbing, air conditioning or lighting fixtures, or from any other cause, whether the said injury or damage results from conditions arising upon the Leased Property, or any part thereof, or from other sources or places, and regardless of whether the cause of such damage or injury or the means of repairing the same is accessible or not, unless such damage or injury is a result of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Lessor.  Lessor shall not be liable for any damages arising from any act or omission of Lessee, or any other party named above. </P>

</B>21.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I><U>Indemnification</U>.  </I>Notwithstanding the existence of any insurance provided for in <B><U>Article XIII</B></U>, and without regard to the policy limits of any such insurance, Lessee will protect, indemnify, save harmless and defend Lessor from and against all liabilities, obligations, claims, damages, awards, penalties, causes of action, costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses), to the extent permitted by law, imposed upon or incurred by or asserted against Lessor by reason of: (a) any accident, injury to or death of persons or loss of or damage to property occurring on or about the Leased Property or adjoining sidewalks, including without limitation any claims of malpractice, (b) any occupancy, use, misuse, non-use, condition, including any environmental conditions caused by Lessee, maintenance or repair by Lessee of the Leased Property, (c) any Impositions (which are the obligations of Lessee to pay pursuant to the applicable provisions of this Lease), (d) any failure on the part of Lessee to in any way perform or comply with any of the terms of this Lease, and (e) the non-performance of any of the terms and provisions of any and all existing and future subleases of the Leased Property (to the extent permitted) to be performed by the Lessee thereunder. Any amounts which become payable by Lessee under this Section shall be paid within ten (10) Business Days of receipt by Lessee of Lessor's written demand for such sums, and if not timely paid, shall bear a late charge (to the extent permitted by law), at the rate set forth in <B><U>Section 3.5</B></U> above, from the date of such determination to the date of payment. Lessee, at its sole cost and expense, shall contest, resist and defend any such claim, action or proceeding asserted or instituted against Lessor, or may compromise or otherwise dispose of the same as Lessee sees fit, all at Lessee's sole cost and expense.  Nothing herein shall be construed as indemnifying Lessor against its own grossly negligent, reckless or willful misconduct or against the acts or omissions of any subsequent lessee of the Leased Property in the event of the termination by Lessor of Lessee's right to possession of the Leased Property without termination of the Lease. Lessee's liability for a breach of the provisions of this Article arising during the Term hereof shall survive any termination of this Lease. </P>

<I><U>Lessor May Grant Liens</U>.  </I>Without the consent of Lessee, but subject to the terms and conditions set forth below in this <B><U>Section 32.1</B></U>, Lessor may, from time-to-time, directly or indirectly, create or otherwise cause to exist any lien or encumbrance or any other change of title (&quot;<B>Encumbrance</B>&quot;) upon the Leased Property, or any portion thereof or interest therein, whether to secure any borrowing or other means of financing or refinancing or otherwise.  Provided that Lessee receives the non-disturbance agreement described below, this Lease is and at all times shall be subject and subordinate to any such Encumbrance which may now or hereafter affect the Leased Property and to all renewals, modifications, consolidations, replacements and extensions thereof.  This clause shall be self-operative and no further instruments of subordination shall be required; provided, however that, at any time from time to time, within ten (10) days after the request by Lessor or any holder of any Encumbrance, Lessee shall execute an agreement to the effect that this Lease shall be subject and subordinate to the lien of any such new Encumbrance on the Leased Property, and that in the event of any default or foreclosure under such Encumbrance, Lessee shall attorn to the holder of such lien, and as otherwise requested by Lessor; provided further, however, that the subjection and subordination of this Lease and Lessee's leasehold interest hereunder to any Encumbrance now in effect or hereafter imposed by Lessor shall be conditioned upon the execution by the holder of such Encumbrance and delivery to Lessee of a commercially reasonable non-disturbance agreement specifying, among other things, that (a) so long as Lessee has not committed an Event of Default, in the event of any foreclosure, judicial sale or deed in lieu of foreclosure, Lessee's rights and leasehold estate hereunder shall not be disturbed by the holder of such Encumbrance, its successors or assigns or any successful bidder; and (b) notwithstanding such subordination, so long as Lessee has not committed an Event of Default and no event has occurred which with the passage of time or the giving of notice or both would constitute an Event of Default under this Lease, the holder of such Encumbrance will recognize the rights of the parties under the terms of this Lease with respect to the disposition of insurance payments and condemnation proceeds in the event of any casualty or condemnation.</P>

32.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I><U>Attornment</U>.</I>  If Lessor's interest in the Leased Property is sold or conveyed upon the exercise of any remedy provided for in any Encumbrance, or otherwise by operation of law: (i) at the new owner's option, Lessee shall attorn to and recognize the new owner as Lessee's lessor under this Lease, in which case this Lease shall automatically become a new lease between Lessee and the new owner upon all of the terms and conditions hereof, or enter into a new lease in the exact form and substance of this Lease with the new owner, and Lessee shall take such actions to confirm the foregoing within ten (10) Business Days after request; and (ii) the new owner (other than any new owner or other entity which is an Affiliate of Lessor) shall not be (a) liable for any act or omission of Lessor under this Lease occurring prior to such sale or conveyance, or (b) subject to any offset, abatement or reduction of rent because of any default of Lessor under this Lease occurring prior to such sale or conveyance.</P>

32.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

All sums so paid by Lessee and all costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees) so incurred, together with interest thereon from the date on which such sums or expenses are paid or incurred by Lessee, shall be paid by Lessor to Lessee on demand, but may not be offset by Lessee against payments of Rent hereunder.</P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
32.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<I><U>Breach by Lessor</U>  </I>It shall be a breach of this Lease if Lessor fails to observe or perform any term, covenant or condition of this Lease on its part to be performed, and such failure shall continue for a period of thirty (30) days, after written Notice thereof from Lessee, unless such failure cannot with due diligence be cured within a period of thirty (30) days, in which case such failure shall not be deemed to continue if Lessor, within said thirty (30) day period, proceeds promptly and with due diligence to cure the failure and diligently completes the curing thereof.  The time within which Lessor shall be obligated to cure any such failure shall also be subject to extension of time due to the occurrence of any Unavoidable Delay. </P>

Provided, however, in no event shall the Minimum Rent for the first year of the first Extended Term exceed by fifteen percent (15%) or more the amount of Minimum Rent at the end of the Initial Term.  The initial Minimum Rent payable during the second Extended Term, shall be the higher of (i)&nbsp;the Minimum Rent payable during the last twelve (12) months of the previous Extended Term increased by two percent (2%), or (ii) the Fair Market Rent, as determined in <B><U>Section 34.3</B></U> below, or (iii) the Minimum Rent during the first lease year of the first Extended Term multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the C.P.I. as of the commencement date of the second Extended Term and the denominator of which is the C.P.I. as of the commencement date of the first Extended Term  Minimum Rent during the Extended Term shall be subject to annual adjustments as provided in <B><U>Section 3.1</B></U>.

34.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<I><U>Determination of Fair Market Rent</U></I>.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
If Lessor and Lessee cannot agree on the Fair Market Rent within thirty (30) days after the date of any Notice to Extend with respect to the first or second Extended Term, each party shall, by notice to the other, appoint a disinterested and licensed M.A.I. Real Estate Appraiser of national reputation and renown with at least five years of experience in appraising assisted living facilities throughout the United States with the same types of operating licenses then being in effect at each respective Facility to determine the Fair Market Rent.  If any party should fail to appoint an appraiser within ten (10) days after notice, the appraiser selected by the other party shall determine the Fair Market Rent.  In determining the Fair Market Rent, each appraiser shall give appropriate consideration to, among other things, generally applicable minimum rent for tenancies of property comparable to the Leased Property in the area in which the Leased Property is located.</P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
If the two appraisers selected pursuant to <B><U>Section 34.3(i)</B></U> above, cannot agree upon the Fair Market Rent within forty-five (45) days, they shall immediately give written notice of such inability (&quot;<B>Notice of Disagreement</B>&quot;) to both Lessor and Lessee setting forth the Fair Market Rent determinations of each of the appraisers.  If the determinations of each of the two appraisers of the Fair Market Rent at the commencement of such Extended Term differ by less than ten percent (10%) of the lower determination, the Fair Market Rent shall be fixed at an amount equal to the average of the two determinations.</P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
If the determinations of each of the two appraisers selected pursuant to <B><U>Section 34.3(i)</B></U>, above, differ by ten percent (10%) or more of the lower determination with respect to the Fair Market Rent to be paid at the commencement of such Extended Term, then within thirty (30) days after the giving of the Notice of Disagreement, the two appraisers shall appoint a third disinterested and licensed M.A.I. Real Estate Appraiser of national reputation and renown with at least five (5) years of experience appraising assisted living facilities throughout the United States with the same types of operating licenses then being in effect at each respective Facility.  If the parties cannot then agree on the Fair Market Rent, the third appraiser shall determine the Fair Market Rent, and in so doing, shall give appropriate consideration to those items described in <B><U>Section 34.3(i)</B></U>.  The third appraiser shall not select a Fair Market Rent either (i) higher than the highest of the two appraisals made pursuant to <B><U>Section&nbsp;34.3(i)</B></U>; or (ii)&nbsp;lower than the lowest of the two appraisals made pursuant to <B><U>Section&nbsp;34.3(i)</B></U>, above.  If the first two appraisers cannot agree on the selection of a third appraiser within such thirty (30) days, or if the first two appraisers fail to provide a Notice of Disagreement (as stated above in <B><U>Section 34.3(ii)</B></U>, above, then the Fair Market Rent shall be determined by a third appraiser selected by the American Arbitration Association upon application by Lessor.</P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the time before the determination of the Fair Market Rent, Lessee shall pay Minimum Rent at the rate paid immediately preceding such Extended Term, increased by two percent (2%); provided, however, that, if the Fair Market Rent is determined to be higher than such amount, the Minimum Rent owed by Lessee at the Fair Market Rent shall be effective retroactively as of the first day of such Extended Term.  If, after the Minimum Rent for an Extended Term is adjusted and applied retroactively as of the first day of such Extended Term, it is determined that additional Minimum Rent is due Lessor, the aggregate amount of any such additional Minimum Rent shall be paid to Lessor within thirty (30) days of the determination of the Fair Market Rent for such Extended Term.</P>
