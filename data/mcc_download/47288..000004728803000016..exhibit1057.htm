<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=4>RECITALS </FONT></H1>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
Hibernia Corporation, a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of
Louisiana (the &#147;Company&#148;), maintains the Hibernia Corporation Long-Term
Incentive Plan, which Plan was first approved by the shareholders of the Company on
September 23, 1992; and </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
on April 29, 1997, the shareholders of the Company approved an amendment to the Plan
empowering the Board of Directors of the Company to amend the terms of the Plan, from time
to time, in its discretion; and </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
in accordance with the authority granted to the Board of Directors of the Company, the
Board (or a committee thereof) has reviewed the definition of &#147;Fair Market
Value&#148; contained in the Plan and determined that to reduce certain administrative
burdens in connection with the operation of the Plan, the definition should be revised to
relate to an opening sales price rather than to an average of the high and low sales
prices on that date of determination; and </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
on February 26, 2003, the Board of Directors approved an amendment to the Plan to provide
that the &#147;Fair Market Value&#148; of a Share (as defined in the Plan) as of a
specified date means the opening sales price of a share of Common Stock on such date. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW,
THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises set forth above, and effective as of the date
first above written, the Plan shall be and hereby is amended as follows: </FONT></P>
