401(a)(17), 401(k)(3), &nbsp;<BR>401(m), 402(g) or 415 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#147;Code&#148;) (which Code Sections, as used in this Supplemental Plan, shall include any comparable section or sections of any future

aforementioned limitations of the Code. The rights and benefits of any participant whose employment terminated prior to January 1, 2000 will be governed by the terms of the FCN Supplemental Plan or the BOC Supplemental Plan, as applicable, as in
