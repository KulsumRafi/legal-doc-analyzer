3        REGISTERED EXCHANGE OFFER

         (a) Unless the Exchange Offer shall not be permitted by applicable
federal law (after the procedures set forth in Section 6(a)(i) below have been
complied with), the Company and the Guarantors shall (i) cause the Exchange
Offer Registration Statement to be filed with the Commission as soon as
practicable after the Closing Date, but in no event later than 120 days after
the Closing Date (such 120th day being the "FILING DEADLINE"), (ii) use their
respective reasonable best efforts to cause such Exchange Offer Registration
Statement to become effective at the earliest possible time, but in no event
later than 210 days after the Closing Date (such 210th day being the
"EFFECTIVENESS DEADLINE"), (iii) in connection with the foregoing, (A) file all
pre-effective amendments to such Exchange Offer Registration Statement as may be
necessary in order to cause it to become effective, (B) file, if applicable, a
post-effective amendment to such Exchange Offer Registration Statement pursuant
to Rule 430A under the Act and (C) cause all necessary filings, if any, in
connection with the registration and qualification of the Series B Notes to be
made under the Blue Sky laws of such jurisdictions as are necessary to permit
Consummation of the Exchange Offer, and (iv) upon the effectiveness of such
Exchange Offer Registration Statement, use their respective reasonable best
efforts to commence and Consummate the Exchange Offer. The



                                       3
<PAGE>

Exchange Offer shall be on the appropriate form permitting (i) registration of
the Series B Notes to be offered in exchange for the Series A Notes that are
Transfer Restricted Securities and (ii) resales of Series B Notes by
Broker-Dealers that tendered into the Exchange Offer Series A Notes that such
Broker-Dealer acquired for its own account as a result of market making
activities or other trading activities (other than Series A Notes acquired
directly from the Company or any of its Affiliates) as contemplated by Section
3(c) below.

         (b) The Company and the Guarantors shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts to cause the Exchange Offer Registration Statement to be
effective continuously, and shall keep the Exchange Offer open for a period of
not less than the minimum period required under applicable federal and state
securities laws to Consummate the Exchange Offer; provided, however, that in no
event shall such period be less than 30 days. The Company and the Guarantors
shall cause the Exchange Offer to comply with all applicable federal and state
securities laws. No securities other than the Series B Notes and the Guarantees
shall be included in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement. The Company and
the Guarantors shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to cause the
Exchange Offer to be Consummated on the earliest practicable date after the
Exchange Offer Registration Statement has become effective, but in no event
later than 45 days thereafter (such 45th day being the "CONSUMMATION DEADLINE").

         (c) The Company shall include a "Plan of Distribution" section in the
Prospectus contained in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement and indicate
therein that any Broker-Dealer who holds Transfer Restricted Securities that
were acquired for the account of such Broker-Dealer as a result of market-making
activities or other trading activities (other than Series A Notes acquired
directly from the Company or any Affiliate of the Company), may exchange such
Transfer Restricted Securities pursuant to the Exchange Offer. Such "Plan of
Distribution" section shall also contain all other information with respect to
such sales by such Broker-Dealers that the Commission may require in order to
permit such sales pursuant thereto, but such "Plan of Distribution" shall not
name any such Broker-Dealer or disclose the amount of Transfer Restricted
Securities held by any such Broker-Dealer, except to the extent required by the
Commission as a result of a change in policy, rules or regulations after the
date of this Agreement. See the Shearman & Sterling no-action letter (available
July 2, 1993).

         Because such Broker-Dealer may be deemed to be an "underwriter" within
the meaning of the Act and must, therefore, deliver a prospectus meeting the
requirements of the Act in connection with its initial sale of any Series B
Notes received by such Broker-Dealer in the Exchange Offer, the Company and the
Guarantors shall permit the use of the Prospectus contained in the Exchange
Offer Registration Statement by such Broker-Dealer to satisfy such prospectus
delivery requirement. To the extent necessary to ensure that the prospectus
contained in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement is available for sales of
Series B Notes by Broker-Dealers, the Company and the Guarantors agree to use
their respective best efforts to keep the Exchange Offer Registration Statement
continuously effective, supplemented, amended and current as required by and
subject to the provisions of Sections 6(a) and (c) hereof and in conformity with
the requirements of this Agreement, the Act and the policies, rules and
regulations of the Commission as announced from time to time, for a period of 90
days from the Consummation Deadline. The Company and the Guarantors shall
provide sufficient copies of the latest version of such Prospectus to such
Broker-Dealers, promptly upon request, and in no event later than one day after
such request, at any time during such period.



                                       4

4        SHELF REGISTRATION

         (a) SHELF REGISTRATION. If (i) the Exchange Offer is not permitted by
applicable law (after the Company and the Guarantors have complied with the
procedures set forth in Section 6(a)(i) below) or (ii) if any Holder shall
notify the Company within 20 Business Days following the Consummation of the
Exchange Offer that (A) such Holder was prohibited by law or Commission policy
from participating in the Exchange Offer or (B) such Holder may not resell the
Series B Notes acquired by it in the Exchange Offer to the public without
delivering a prospectus and the Prospectus contained in the Exchange Offer
Registration Statement is not appropriate or available for such resales by such
Holder, then the Company and the Guarantors shall:

                  (x) cause to be filed, on or prior to 30 days after the
         earlier of (i) the date on which the Company determines that the
         Exchange Offer Registration Statement cannot be filed as a result of
         clause (a)(i) above and (ii) the date on which the Company receives the
         notice specified in clause (a)(ii) above (such earlier date, the "SHELF
         FILING DEADLINE"), a shelf registration statement pursuant to Rule 415
         under the Act (which may be an amendment to the Exchange Offer
         Registration Statement (the "SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT")), relating
         to all Transfer Restricted Securities, and

                  (y) use their respective reasonable best efforts to cause such
         Shelf Registration Statement to become effective on or prior to 120
         days after the Filing Deadline for the Shelf Registration Statement
         (such 120th day, the "SHELF EFFECTIVENESS DEADLINE").

         If, after the Company has filed an Exchange Offer Registration
Statement that satisfies the requirements of Section 3(a) above, the Company is
required to file and make effective a Shelf Registration Statement solely
because the Exchange Offer is not permitted under applicable federal law (i.e.,
clause (a)(i) above), then the filing of the Exchange Offer Registration
Statement shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements of clause (x) above;
provided that, in such event, the Company shall remain obligated to meet the
Effectiveness Deadline set forth in clause (y).

         To the extent necessary to ensure that the Shelf Registration Statement
is available for sales of Transfer Restricted Securities by the Holders thereof
entitled to the benefit of this Section 4(a) and the other securities required
to be registered therein pursuant to Section 6(b)(ii) hereof, the Company and
the Guarantors shall use their respective best efforts to keep any Shelf
Registration Statement required by this Section 4(a) continuously effective,
supplemented, amended and current as required by and subject to the provisions
of Sections 6(b) and (c) hereof and in conformity with the requirements of this
Agreement, the Act and the policies, rules and regulations of the Commission as
announced from time to time, for a period of at least two years (as extended
pursuant to Section 6(c)(i)) following the date on which such Shelf Registration
Statement first becomes effective under the Act or such shorter period that will
terminate when all the Transfer Restricted Securities covered by the Shelf
Registration Statement have been sold pursuant to the Shelf Registration
Statement or are eligible for resale under Rule 144(k) of the Act.

         (b) PROVISION BY HOLDERS OF CERTAIN INFORMATION IN CONNECTION WITH THE
SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT. No Holder may include any of its Transfer
Restricted Securities in any Shelf Registration Statement pursuant to this
Agreement unless and until such Holder furnishes to the Company in writing,
within 20 days after receipt of a request therefor, the information specified in
Items 507 or 508 of Regulation S-K, as applicable, of the Act for use in
connection with any Shelf Registration Statement or Prospectus or preliminary
Prospectus included therein.



                                       5
<PAGE>

No Holder shall be entitled to Special Interest pursuant to Section 5 hereof
unless and until such Holder shall have provided all such information. Each
selling Holder agrees to promptly furnish additional information required to be
disclosed in order to make the information previously furnished to the Company
by such Holder not materially misleading.

5        SPECIAL INTEREST

         If (i) any Registration Statement required by this Agreement is not
filed with the Commission on or prior to the Filing Deadline or Shelf Filing
Deadline, as applicable, (ii) any such Registration Statement has not been
declared effective by the Commission on or prior to the Effectiveness Deadline
or Shelf Effectiveness Deadline, as applicable, (iii) the Exchange Offer has not
been Consummated on or prior to the Consummation Deadline or (iv) any
Registration Statement required by this Agreement is filed and declared
effective but shall thereafter cease to be effective (except as specifically
permitted herein) or fail to be usable for its intended purpose without being
succeeded immediately by a post-effective amendment to such Registration
Statement that cures such failure and that is itself immediately declared
effective (each such event referred to in clauses (i) through (iv), a
"REGISTRATION DEFAULT" and each period during which a Registration Default has
occurred and is continuing, a "REGISTRATION DEFAULT PERIOD"), then the Company
and the Guarantors hereby jointly and severally agree to pay to each Holder
affected thereby liquidated damages as special interest ("SPECIAL INTEREST") in
an amount which shall accrue at a per annum rate of 0.25% for the first 90 days
of the Registration Default Period, at a per annum rate of 0.50% for the second
90 days of the Registration Default Period, at a per annum rate of 0.75% for the
third 90 days of the Registration Default Period and at a per annum rate of 1.0%
thereafter for the remaining portion of the Registration Default Period.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, (1) upon filing of
the Exchange Offer Registration Statement (and/or, if applicable, the Shelf
Registration Statement), in the case of (i) above, (2) upon the effectiveness of
the Exchange Offer Registration Statement (and/or, if applicable, the Shelf
Registration Statement), in the case of (ii) above, (3) upon Consummation of the
Exchange Offer, in the case of (iii) above, or (4) upon the filing of a
post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement or an additional
Registration Statement that causes the Exchange Offer Registration Statement
(and/or, if applicable, the Shelf Registration Statement) to again be declared
effective or made usable in the case of (iv) above, the Special Interest payable
with respect to the Transfer Restricted Securities as a result of such clause
(i), (ii), (iii) or (iv), or (5) once the Transfer Restricted Securities are
eligible for resale under Rule 144(k) of the Act, as applicable, shall cease (at
which time the interest rate shall be restored to its initial rate).

         All accrued Special Interest shall be paid to the Holders entitled
thereto, in the manner provided for the payment of interest in the Indenture, on
each Interest Payment Date, as more fully set forth in the Indenture and the
Notes. Notwithstanding the fact that any securities for which Special Interest
is due cease to be Transfer Restricted Securities, all obligations of the
Company and the Guarantors to pay Special Interest with respect to securities
shall survive until such time as such obligations with respect to such
securities shall have been satisfied in full.

6        REGISTRATION PROCEDURES

         (a) EXCHANGE OFFER REGISTRATION STATEMENT. In connection with the
Exchange Offer, the Company and the Guarantors shall (x) use their respective
best efforts to effect such exchange and to permit the resale of Series B Notes
by Broker-Dealers that tendered in the Exchange Offer



                                       6
<PAGE>

Series A Notes that such Broker-Dealer acquired for its own account as a result
of its market making activities or other trading activities (other than Series A
Notes acquired directly from the Company or any of its Affiliates) being sold in
accordance with the intended method or methods of distribution thereof, and (y)
comply with all of the following provisions:

                  (i) If, following the date hereof there has been announced a
         change in Commission policy with respect to exchange offers such as the
         Exchange Offer, that in the reasonable opinion of counsel to the
         Company raises a substantial question as to whether the Exchange Offer
         is permitted by applicable federal law, the Company and the Guarantors
         hereby agree to seek a no-action letter or other favorable decision
         from the Commission allowing the Company and the Guarantors to
         Consummate an Exchange Offer for such Transfer Restricted Securities.
         The Company and the Guarantors hereby agree to pursue the issuance of
         such a decision to the Commission staff level but shall not be required
         to take commercially unreasonable action to effect a change of
         Commission policy. In connection with the foregoing, the Company and
         the Guarantors hereby agree to take all such other reasonable actions
         as may be requested by the Commission or otherwise required in
         connection with the issuance of such decision, including without
         limitation (A) participating in telephonic conferences with the
         Commission, (B) delivering to the Commission staff an analysis prepared
         by counsel to the Company setting forth the legal bases, if any, upon
         which such counsel has concluded that such an Exchange Offer should be
         permitted and (C) diligently pursuing a resolution (which need not be
         favorable) by the Commission staff.

                  (ii) As a condition to its participation in the Exchange
         Offer, each Holder (including, without limitation, any Holder who is a
         Broker Dealer) shall furnish, upon the request of the Company, prior to
         the Consummation of the Exchange Offer, a written representation to the
         Company and the Guarantors (which may be contained in the letter of
         transmittal contemplated by the Exchange Offer Registration Statement)
         to the effect that (A) it is not an Affiliate of the Company, (B) it is
         not engaged in, and does not intend to engage in, and has no
         arrangement or understanding with any person to participate in, a
         distribution of the Series B Notes to be issued in the Exchange Offer
         and (C) it is acquiring the Series B Notes in its ordinary course of
         business. As a condition to its participation in the Exchange Offer,
         each Holder using the Exchange Offer to participate in a distribution
         of the Series B Notes shall acknowledge and agree that, if the resales
         are of Series B Notes obtained by such Holder in exchange for Series A
         Notes acquired directly from the Company or an Affiliate thereof, it
         (1) could not, under Commission policy as in effect on the date of this
         Agreement, rely on the position of the Commission enunciated in MORGAN
         STANLEY AND CO., INC. (available June 5, 1991) and EXXON CAPITAL
         HOLDINGS CORPORATION (available May 13, 1988), as interpreted in the
         Commission's letter to SHEARMAN & STERLING dated July 2, 1993, and
         similar no-action letters (including, if applicable, any no-action
         letter obtained pursuant to clause (i) above), and (2) must comply
         with the registration and prospectus delivery requirements of the Act
         in connection with a secondary resale transaction and that such a
         secondary resale transaction must be covered by an effective
         registration statement containing the selling security holder
         information required by Items 507 or 508, as applicable, of Regulation
         S-K.

<PAGE>


                  (iii) Prior to effectiveness of the Exchange Offer
         Registration Statement, the Company and the Guarantors shall, if
         requested by the staff of the Commission, provide a supplemental letter
         to the Commission (A) stating that the Company and the Guarantors are
         registering the Exchange Offer in reliance on the position of the
         Commission enunciated in EXXON CAPITAL HOLDINGS CORPORATION (available
         May 13, 1988), MORGAN STANLEY AND CO., INC. (available June 5, 1991) as
         interpreted in the Commission's letter to SHEARMAN & STERLING dated
         July 2, 1993, and, if applicable, any no-action letter obtained
         pursuant to clause (i) above, (B) including a representation that
         neither the Company nor any Guarantor has entered into any arrangement
         or understanding with any Person to distribute the Series B Notes to be
         received in the Exchange Offer and that, to the best of the Company's
         and each Guarantor's information and belief, each Holder participating
         in the Exchange Offer is acquiring the Series B Notes in its ordinary
         course of business and has no arrangement or understanding with any
         Person to participate in the distribution of the Series B Notes
         received in the Exchange Offer and (C) any other undertaking or
         representation required by the Commission as set forth in any no-action

         Indenture to be qualified in accordance with the terms of the TIA; and

         all other forms and documents required to be filed with the Commission
         to enable such Indenture to be so qualified in a timely manner.

         (b) Shelf Registration Statement. In connection with the Shelf
Registration Statement, the Company and the Guarantors shall:

                  (i) comply with all the provisions of Section 6(c) below and
         use their respective best efforts to effect such registration to permit
         the sale of the Transfer Restricted Securities being sold in accordance
         with the intended method or methods of distribution thereof (as
         indicated in the information furnished to the Company pursuant to
         Section 4(b) hereof), and pursuant thereto the Company and the
         Guarantors will prepare and file with the Commission a Registration
         Statement relating to the registration on any appropriate form under
         the Act, which form shall be available for the sale of the Transfer
         Restricted Securities in accordance with the intended method or methods
         of distribution thereof within the time periods and otherwise in
         accordance with the provisions hereof, and

                  (ii) issue, upon the request of any Holder or purchaser of
         Series A Notes covered by any Shelf Registration Statement contemplated
         by this Agreement, Series B Notes having an aggregate principal amount
         equal to the aggregate principal amount of Series A Notes sold pursuant
         to the Shelf Registration Statement and surrendered to the Company for
         cancellation; the Company shall register Series B Notes on the Shelf
         Registration Statement for this purpose and




                                       8
<PAGE>

         issue the Series B Notes to the purchaser(s) of securities subject to
         the Shelf Registration Statement in the names as such purchaser(s)
         shall designate.

         (c) GENERAL SHELF PROVISIONS. In connection with any Shelf Registration
Statement and any related Prospectus required by this Agreement, the Company and
the Guarantors shall:

                  (i) use their respective best efforts to keep such
         Registration Statement continuously effective and provide all requisite
         financial statements for the period specified in Sections 3 or 4 of
         this Agreement, as applicable. Upon the occurrence of any event that
         would cause any such Registration Statement or the Prospectus contained
         therein (A) to contain an untrue statement of material fact or omit to
         state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein not
         misleading or (B) not to be effective and usable for resale of Transfer
         Restricted Securities during the period required by this Agreement, the
         Company and the Guarantors shall file promptly an appropriate amendment
         to such Registration Statement curing such defect, and, if Commission
         review is required, use their respective best efforts to cause such
         amendment to be declared effective as soon as practicable.
         Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may suspend the offering and
         sales under the Exchange Offer Registration Statement subsequent to the
         Consummation of the Exchange Offer or the Shelf Registration Statement
         for up to 60 days in each year during which such Exchange Offer
         Registration Statement is required to be effective and usable hereunder
         subsequent to the Consummation of the Exchange Offer or such Shelf
         Registration Statement is required to be effective and usable hereunder
         (measured from the date of effectiveness of such Shelf Registration
         Statement to successive anniversaries thereof) if (A) either (y)(I) the
         Company shall be engaged in a material acquisition or disposition and
         (II)(aa) such acquisition or disposition is required to be disclosed in
         the Exchange Offer Registration Statement or the Shelf Registration
         Statement, the related Prospectus or any amendment or supplement
         thereto, or the failure by the Company to disclose such transaction in
         the Exchange Offer Registration Statement or the Shelf Registration
         Statement or related Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement
         thereto, as then amended or supplemented, would cause such Exchange
         Offer Registration Statement or Shelf Registration Statement, or
         amendment thereto, to contain an untrue statement of material fact or
         omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statement
         therein not misleading, or would cause such Prospectus, or supplement
         thereto, to contain an untrue statement of material fact or omit to
         state a material fact necessary in order to make the statement therein
         not misleading, in light of the circumstances under which they were
         made, (bb) information regarding the existence of such acquisition or
         disposition has not then been publicly disclosed by or on behalf of the
         Company and (cc) a majority of the Board of Directors of the Company
         determines in the exercise of its good faith judgment that disclosure
         of such acquisition or disposition would not be in the best interest of
         the Company or would have a material adverse effect on the consummation
         of such acquisition or disposition or (z) a majority of the Board of
         Directors of the Company determines in the exercise of its good faith
         judgment that compliance with the disclosure obligations set forth in
         this Section 6(c)(i) would otherwise have a material adverse effect on
         the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and (B) the Company
         notifies the Holders within two business days after such Board of
         Directors makes



                                       9

         the relevant determination set forth in clause (A); provided, however,
         that in each such case the applicable period specified in Section 3
         (subsequent to the Consummation of the Exchange Offer) and Section 4
         hereof during which the applicable Exchange Offer Registration
         Statement or Shelf Registration Statement is required to be kept
         effective and usable shall be extended by the number of days during
         which such effectiveness was suspended pursuant to the foregoing and
         Special Interest shall not apply during any period the Company is
         permitted to suspend offerings and sales under this sentence;

                  (ii) prepare and file with the Commission such amendments and
         post-effective amendments to the applicable Registration Statement as
         may be necessary to keep such Registration Statement effective for the
         applicable period set forth in Sections 3 or 4 hereof, as the case may
         be; cause the Prospectus to be supplemented by any required Prospectus
         supplement, and as so supplemented to be filed pursuant to Rule 424
         under the Act, and to comply fully with Rules 424, 430A and 462, as
         applicable, under the Act in a timely manner; and comply with the
         provisions of the Act with respect to the disposition of all securities
         covered by such Registration Statement during the applicable period in
         accordance with the intended method or methods of distribution by the
         sellers thereof set forth in such Registration Statement or supplement
         to the Prospectus;

                  (iii) advise each Holder promptly and, if requested by such
         Holder, confirm such advice in writing, (A) when the Prospectus or any
         Prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment has been filed, and,
         with respect to any applicable Registration Statement or any
         post-effective amendment thereto, when the same has become effective,
         (B) of any request by the Commission for amendments to the Registration
         Statement or amendments or supplements to the Prospectus or for
         additional information relating thereto, (C) of the issuance by the
         Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the
         Registration Statement under the Act or of the suspension by any state
         securities commission of the qualification of the Transfer Restricted
         Securities for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or the initiation
         of any proceeding for any of the preceding purposes, (D) of the
         existence of any fact or the happening of any event that makes any
         statement of a material fact made in the Registration Statement, the
         Prospectus, any amendment or supplement thereto or any document
         incorporated by reference therein untrue, or that requires the making
         of any additions to or changes in the Registration Statement in order
         to make the statements therein not misleading, or that requires the
         making of any additions to or changes in the Prospectus in order to
         make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under
         which they were made, not misleading. If at any time the Commission
         shall issue any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the
         Registration Statement, or any state securities commission or other
         regulatory authority shall issue an order suspending the qualification
         or exemption from qualification of the Transfer Restricted Securities
         under state securities or Blue Sky laws, the Company and the Guarantors
         shall use their respective best efforts to obtain the withdrawal or
         lifting of such order at the earliest possible time;

                  (iv) subject to Section 6(c)(i), if any fact or event
         contemplated by Section 6(c)(iii)(D) above shall exist or have
         occurred, prepare a supplement or post-effective amendment to the
         Registration Statement or related Prospectus or any document
         incorporated therein by reference or file any other required document
         so that, as thereafter delivered to the purchasers of Transfer
         Restricted Securities, the Prospectus will not contain an untrue
         statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
         necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the
         circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;

                  (v) furnish to each Holder, who shall certify to the Company
         that they have a present intention to sell Transfer Restricted
         Securities in connection with such exchange or sale, if any, before
         filing with the Commission, copies of any Registration Statement or any
         Prospectus included therein or any amendments or supplements to any
         such Registration Statement or Prospectus (including all documents
         incorporated by reference after the initial filing of such Registration
         Statement), which documents will be subject to the review and comment
         of such Holders in connection with such sale, if any, for a period of
         at least five Business Days, and the Company will not file any such
         Registration Statement or Prospectus or any amendment or supplement to
         any such Registration Statement or Prospectus (including all such
         documents incorporated by reference) to which such Holders shall
         reasonably object within five Business Days after the receipt thereof;

                  (vi) promptly prior to the filing of any document that is
         to be incorporated by reference into a Registration Statement or
         Prospectus, provide copies of such document to each Holder in
         connection with such exchange or sale, if any, make the Company's and
         the Guarantors' representatives available for discussion of such
         document and other customary due diligence matters, and include such
         information in such document prior to the filing thereof as such
         Holders may reasonably request;

                  (vii) make available, at reasonable times, for inspection by
         each Holder and any attorney or accountant retained by such Holders who
         shall certify to the Company that they have a current intention to sell
         the Transfer Restricted Securities, all financial and other records,
         pertinent corporate documents of the Company and the Guarantors and
         cause the Company's and the Guarantors' officers, directors and
         employees to supply all information reasonably requested by any such
         Holder, attorney or accountant in connection with such Registration
         Statement or any post-effective amendment thereto subsequent to the
         filing thereof and prior to its effectiveness, in the reasonable
         judgment of counsel for the Company, to conduct a reasonable
         investigation within the meaning of Section 11 of the Securities Act;
         provided, however, that each such party shall be required to maintain
         in confidence and not to disclose to any other person any information
         or records designated by the Company in writing as being confidential,
         until such time as (A) such information becomes a matter of public
         record (whether by virtue of its inclusion in such registration
         statement or otherwise), or (B) such person shall be required, or shall
         deem it advisable, so to disclose such information pursuant to the
         subpoena or order of any court or other governmental agency or body
         having jurisdiction over the matter (subject to the requirement of such
         order, and only after

         information is required to be set forth in the Prospectus, or
         supplement thereto, in order that such Prospectus, or supplement
         thereto, does not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or

         necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in light of the
         circumstances under which they were made;

                  (viii) if requested by any Holders in connection with such
         exchange or sale, promptly include in any Registration Statement or
         Prospectus, pursuant to a supplement or post-effective amendment if
         necessary, such information as such Holders may reasonably request to

                  (ix) furnish to each Holder in connection with such exchange
         or sale, without charge, at least one copy of the Registration
         Statement, as first filed with the Commission, and of each amendment

         with law) of the Prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto by
         each selling Holder in connection with the offering and the sale of the
         Transfer Restricted Securities covered by the Prospectus or any
         amendment or supplement thereto;

                  (xi) upon the request of any Holder, enter into such
         agreements (including underwriting agreements) and make such

         connection therewith in order to expedite or facilitate the disposition

         the Company nor any Guarantor shall be required to register or qualify
         as a foreign corporation where it is not now so qualified but for the
         requirements of this clause (xii) or to take any action that would
         subject it to the service of process in suits or to taxation, other

         (which need not be audited) covering a twelve-month period beginning
         after the effective date of the Registration Statement (as such term is
         defined in paragraph (c) of Rule 158 under the Act);

                  (xvii) cause the Indenture to be qualified under the TIA not
         later than the effective date of the first Registration Statement
         required by this Agreement and, in connection therewith, cooperate with
         the Trustee and the Holders to effect such changes to the Indenture as
         may be required for such Indenture to be so qualified in accordance
         with the terms of the TIA; and execute and use their respective best
         efforts to cause the Trustee to execute, all documents that may be
         required to effect such changes and all other forms and documents
         required to be filed with the Commission to enable such Indenture to be
         so qualified in a timely manner; and

                  (xviii) provide promptly to each Holder, upon request, each
         document filed with the Commission pursuant to the requirements of
         Section 13 or Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act.

         (d) RESTRICTIONS ON HOLDERS. Each Holder agrees by acquisition of a
Transfer Restricted Security that, upon receipt of the notice referred to in
Section 6(c)(iii)(C) or any notice from the Company of the existence of any fact
of the kind described in Section 6(c)(iii)(D) hereof (in each case, a
"SUSPENSION NOTICE"), such Holder will forthwith discontinue disposition of
Transfer Restricted Securities pursuant to the applicable Registration Statement
until (i) such Holder has received copies of the supplemented or amended
Prospectus contemplated by Section 6(c)(iv) hereof, or (ii) such Holder is
advised in writing by the Company that the use of the Prospectus may be resumed,
and has received copies of any additional or supplemental filings that are
incorporated by reference in the Prospectus (in each case, the "RECOMMENCEMENT
DATE"). Each Holder receiving a Suspension Notice hereby agrees that it will
either (i) destroy any Prospectuses, other



                                       14
<PAGE>

than permanent file copies, then in such Holder's possession which have been
replaced by the Company with more recently dated Prospectuses or (ii) deliver to
the Company (at the Company's expense) all copies, other than permanent file
copies, then in such Holder's possession of the Prospectus covering such
Transfer Restricted Securities that was current at the time of receipt of the
Suspension Notice. The time period regarding the effectiveness of such
Registration Statement set forth in Sections 3 or 4 hereof, as applicable, shall
be extended by a number of days equal to the number of days in the period from
and including the date of delivery of the Suspension Notice to the date of
delivery of the Recommencement Date.

7        REGISTRATION EXPENSES

         (a) All expenses incident to the Company's and the Guarantors'
performance of or compliance with this Agreement will be borne by the Company,
regardless of whether a Registration Statement becomes effective, including
without limitation: (i) all registration and filing fees and expenses; (ii) all
fees and expenses of compliance with federal securities and state Blue Sky or
securities laws; (iii) all expenses of printing (including printing certificates
for the Series B Notes to be issued in the Exchange Offer and printing of
Prospectuses), messenger and delivery services and telephone; (iv) all fees and
disbursements of counsel for the Company, the Guarantors and the Holders; (v)
all application and filing fees in connection with listing the Series B Notes on
a national securities exchange or automated quotation system pursuant to the
requirements hereof; and (vi) all fees and disbursements of independent
certified public accountants of the Company and the Guarantors (including the
expenses of any special audit and comfort letters required by or incident to
such performance). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Holders being registered
shall pay all agency fees and commissions and underwriting discounts and
commissions attributable to the sale of such Transfer Restricted Securities and
the fees and disbursements of any counsel or other advisors or experts retained
by such holders (severally or jointly), other than the counsel and experts
specifically referred to above.

         The Company will, in any event, bear its and the Guarantors' internal
expenses (including, without limitation, all salaries and expenses of its
officers and employees performing legal or accounting duties), the expenses of
any annual audit and the fees and expenses of any Person, including special
experts, retained by the Company or the Guarantors.

8        INDEMNIFICATION

         (a) The Company and the Guarantors agree, jointly and severally, to
indemnify and hold harmless each Holder, its directors, officers and each
Person, if any, who controls such Holder (within the meaning of Section 15 of
the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act), from and against any and all losses,
claims, damages, liabilities, judgments, (including without limitation, any
reasonable legal or other expenses incurred in connection with investigating or
defending any matter, including any action that could give rise to any such
losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments) caused by any untrue
statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any
Registration Statement, preliminary prospectus or Prospectus (or any amendment
or supplement thereto) provided by the Company to any Holder or any prospective
purchaser of Series B Notes or registered Series A Notes, or caused by any
omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading,
except insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments are
caused by an untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or
omission that is based upon



                                       15
<PAGE>

information relating to any of the Holders furnished in writing to the Company
by any of the Holders.

         (b) Each Holder agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and
hold harmless the Company and the Guarantors, and their respective directors and
officers, and each person, if any, who controls (within the meaning of Section
15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act) the Company, or the Guarantors
to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company and the
Guarantors set forth in section (a) above, but only with reference to
information relating to such Holder furnished in writing to the Company by such
Holder expressly for use in any Registration Statement. In case any action or
proceeding shall be brought against the Company, the Guarantors or any of their
directors or officers or any such controlling person in respect of which
indemnity may be sought against a Holder, such Holder shall have the rights and
duties given the Company and the Guarantors pursuant to this Section 8; and the
Company and the Guarantors, such directors or officers or such controlling
person shall have the right and duties given to each Holder pursuant to this
Section 8.

         (c) In case any action shall be commenced involving any person in
respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to Section 8(a) or 8(b) (the
"INDEMNIFIED PARTY"), the indemnified party shall promptly notify the person
against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "INDEMNIFYING PERSON") in writing
and the indemnifying party shall assume the defense of such action, including
the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party and
the payment of all fees and expenses of such counsel, as incurred (except that
in the case of any action in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant
to both Sections 8(a) and 8(b), a Holder shall not be required to assume the
defense of such action pursuant to this Section 8(c), but may employ separate
counsel and participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of
such counsel, except as provided below, shall be at the expense of the Holder).
Any indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any
such action and participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of
such counsel shall be at the expense of the indemnified party unless (i) the
employment of such counsel shall have been specifically authorized in writing by
the indemnifying party, (ii) the indemnifying party shall have failed to assume
the defense of such action or employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
indemnified party or (iii) the named parties to any such action (including any
impleaded parties) include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying
party, and the indemnified party shall have been advised by such counsel that
there may be one or more legal defenses available to it which are different from
or additional to those available to the indemnifying party (in which case the
indemnifying party shall not have the right to assume the defense of such action
on behalf of the indemnified party). In any such case, the indemnifying party
shall not, in connection with any one action or separate but substantially
similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same
general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the fees and expenses of
more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to any local counsel) for
all indemnified parties and all such reasonable fees and expenses shall be
reimbursed as they are incurred. Such firm shall be designated in writing by a
majority of the Holders, in the case of the parties indemnified pursuant to
Section 8(a), and by the Company and Guarantors, in the case of parties
indemnified pursuant to Section 8(b). The indemnifying party shall not be
obligated to indemnify and hold harmless any indemnified party from and against
any losses, claims, damages, liabilities and judgments by reason of any
settlement of any action effected without the indemnifying party's written
consent. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the
indemnified party, effect any settlement or compromise of, or consent to the
entry of judgment with respect to, any pending or



                                       16
<PAGE>

threatened action in respect of which the indemnified party is or could have
been a party and indemnity or contribution may be or could have been sought
hereunder by the indemnified party, unless such settlement, compromise or
judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all
liability on claims that are or could have been the subject matter of such
action and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault,
culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of the indemnified party.

         (d) To the extent that the indemnification provided for in this Section
8 is unavailable to an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims,
damages, liabilities or judgments referred to therein, then each indemnifying
party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the
amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses,
claims, damages, liabilities or judgments (i) in such proportion as is
appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the
Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Holder, on the other hand, from their sale
of Transfer Restricted Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause
8(d)(i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate
to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause 8(d)(i) above
but also the relative fault of the Company and the Guarantors, on the one hand,
and of the Holder, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or
omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or
judgments, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative
fault of the Company and the Guarantors, on the one hand, and of the Holder, on
the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether
the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or
alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the
Company or such Guarantor, on the one hand, or by the Holder, on the other hand,
and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and
opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.

         The Company, the Guarantors and each Holder agree that it would not be
just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8(d) were determined
by pro rata allocation (even if the Holders were treated as one entity for such
purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the
equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. The
amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses,
claims, damages, liabilities or judgments referred to in the immediately
preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set
forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified
party in connection with investigating or defending any matter, including any
action that could have given rise to such losses, claims, damages, liabilities
or judgments. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, no Holder, its
directors, its officers or any Person, if any, who controls such Holder shall be
required to contribute, in the aggregate, any amount in excess of the amount by
which the total received by such Holder with respect to the sale of Transfer
Restricted Securities pursuant to a Registration Statement exceeds (i) the
amount paid by such Holder for such Transfer Restricted Securities and (ii) the
amount of any damages which such Holder has otherwise been required to pay by
reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged
omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning
of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person
who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Holders'
obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 8(c) are several in
proportion to the respective principal amount of Transfer Restricted Securities
held by each Holder hereunder and not joint.

9        UNDERWRITTEN OFFERING

         (a) SELECTION OF UNDERWRITERS. If any of the Transfer Restricted
Securities covered by the Shelf Registration Statement are to be sold pursuant
to an underwritten offering, the managing underwriter or underwriters thereof
shall be designated by the Company.

         (b) PARTICIPATION BY HOLDERS. Each Holder hereby agrees with each other
such Holder that no such Holder may participate in any underwritten offering
hereunder unless such Holder (i) agrees to sell such Holder's Transfer
Restricted Securities on the basis provided in any underwriting arrangements
approved by the persons entitled hereunder to approve such arrangements and (ii)
completes and executes all questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities,
underwriting agreements and other documents reasonably required under the terms
of such underwriting arrangements.

10       RULE 144A AND RULE 144

         The Company and each Guarantor agrees with each Holder, for so long as
any Transfer Restricted Securities remain outstanding and during any period in
which the Company or such Guarantor (i) is not subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of
the Exchange Act, to make available, upon request of any Holder, to such Holder
or beneficial owner of Transfer Restricted Securities in connection with any
sale thereof and any prospective purchaser of such Transfer Restricted
Securities designated by such Holder or beneficial owner, the information
required by Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Act in order to permit resales of such
Transfer Restricted Securities pursuant to Rule 144A, and (ii) is subject to
Section 13 or 15 (d) of the Exchange Act, to make all filings required thereby
in a timely manner in order to permit resales of such Transfer Restricted
Securities pursuant to Rule 144.

11       MISCELLANEOUS

         (a) REMEDIES. The Company and the Guarantors acknowledge and agree that
any failure by the Company and the Guarantors to comply with their respective
obligations under Sections 3 and 4 hereof may result in material irreparable
injury to the Initial Purchasers or the Holders for which there is no adequate
remedy at law, that it will not be possible to measure damages for such injuries
precisely and that, in the event of any such failure, the Initial Purchasers or
any Holder may obtain such relief as may be required to specifically enforce the
Company's and the Guarantors' obligations under Sections 3 and 4 hereof. The
Company and the Guarantors further agree to waive the defense in any action for
specific performance that a remedy at law would be adequate.

         (b) NO INCONSISTENT AGREEMENTS. Neither the Company nor any Guarantor
will, on or after the date of this Agreement, enter into any agreement with
respect to its securities that is inconsistent with the rights granted to the
Holders in this Agreement or otherwise conflicts with the provisions hereof.
Neither the Company nor any Guarantor has previously entered into any agreement
granting any registration rights with respect to its securities to any Person
other than as set forth or incorporated by reference in the Offering Memorandum.
The rights granted to the Holders hereunder do not in any way conflict with and
are not inconsistent with the rights granted to the Holders of the Company's and
the Guarantors' securities under any agreement in effect on the date hereof.



                                       18
<PAGE>

         (c) AMENDMENTS AND WAIVERS. The provisions of this Agreement may not be
amended, modified or supplemented, and waivers or consents to or departures from
the provisions hereof may not be given unless (i) in the case of Section 5
hereof and this Section 10(c)(i), the Company has obtained the written consent
of Holders of all outstanding Transfer Restricted Securities and (ii) in the
case of all other provisions hereof, the Company has obtained the written
consent of Holders of a majority of the outstanding principal amount of Transfer
Restricted Securities (excluding Transfer Restricted Securities held by the
Company or its Affiliates). Notwithstanding the foregoing, a waiver or consent
to departure from the provisions hereof that relates exclusively to the rights
of Holders whose Transfer Restricted Securities are being tendered pursuant to
the Exchange Offer, and that does not affect directly or indirectly the rights
of other Holders whose Transfer Restricted Securities are not being tendered
pursuant to such Exchange Offer, may be given by the Holders of a majority of
the outstanding principal amount of Transfer Restricted Securities subject to
such Exchange Offer.

         (d) THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARY. The Holders shall be third party
beneficiaries to the agreements made hereunder between the Company and the
Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Initial Purchasers, on the other hand, and
shall have the right to enforce such agreements directly to the extent they may
deem such enforcement necessary or advisable to protect its rights or the rights
of Holders hereunder.

         (e) NOTICES. All notices and other communications provided for or
permitted hereunder shall be made in writing by hand-delivery, first-class mail

Securities shall be held subject to all of the terms of this Agreement, and by
taking and holding such Transfer Restricted Securities such Person shall be
conclusively deemed to have agreed to be bound by and to perform all of the

any such provision in every other respect and of the remaining provisions

final expression of their agreement and intended to be a complete and exclusive

the subject matter contained herein. There are no restrictions, promises,
warranties or undertakings, other than those set forth or referred to herein
with respect to the registration rights granted with respect to the Transfer
Restricted Securities. This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and
understandings between the parties with respect to such subject matter.
