152(a) of the Code) of the Participant, loss of the Participant's property due
to casualty, or other similar extraordinary or unforeseeable circumstances
arising as a result of events beyond the control of the Participant. The
circumstances that will constitute Financial Hardship will depend upon the facts
of each case, but in any case, payment may not be made to the extent that such
hardship is or may be relieved: (a) through reimbursement or compensation by
insurance or otherwise, or (b) by liquidation of the Participant's assets, to
the extent the liquidation of such assets would not itself cause severe

         year in which the Participant remains employed by the Employer,
         beginning on the Participant's initial hire date and ending on the date
         the Participant terminates employment with the Employer. If a
         Participant is an employee as a result of the Company's or one of its
         subsidiaries' acquisition of or merger with the Participant's prior

         participation in a year, the Participant must have projected base
         salary equal to at least $100,000 for the year of participation.

                  (b)      Participation. An eligible employee may elect to
         participate in this Plan with respect to any Deferral Period by
         submitting a Participation Agreement to the Committee, prior to the
         date established by the Committee, in the calendar year immediately
         preceding the Deferral Period. Notwithstanding the forgoing, an
         election to participate in the Plan for the initial Deferral Period
         shall be timely if made within thirty days after the Plan is effective.
         Such election will be made during the current calendar year, but will
         be to defer Compensation for services to be substantially performed
         subsequent to the date of the election.

                  (c)      Partial Year Participation. In the event that an
         employee first becomes eligible to participate during a calendar year,
         a Participation Agreement must be submitted to the Committee no later
         than thirty (30) days following notification to the employee of
         eligibility to participate. Such Participation Agreement shall be
         effective only with regard to Compensation earned following the
         submission of the Participation Agreement to the Committee.

         3.2      Elective Deferrals. A Participant may elect Deferral
Commitments in the Participation Agreement as follows:


Deferred Compensation Plan                                                page 4
<PAGE>
                  (a)      Salary Deferral Commitment. A Salary Deferral
         Commitment shall be related to the salary payable by Company to the
         Participant during the Deferral Period. The amount to be deferred shall
         be stated as a percentage of the salary to be paid during the Deferral
         Period, as a flat dollar amount for the Deferral Period, or in such
         other form as allowed by the Committee.

                  (b)      Bonus Deferral Commitment. A Bonus Deferral
         Commitment shall be related to the bonuses payable to the Participant
         during the Deferral Period. The amount to be deferred shall be stated
         as a percentage of any bonus payable during the Deferral Period, as a
         flat dollar amount from any bonus payable during the Deferral Period,
         or in such other form as allowed by the Committee.

                  (c)      Commission Deferral Commitment. A Commission Deferral
         Commitment shall be related to the commissions payable to the
         Participant during the Deferral Period. The amount to be deferred shall
         be stated as a percentage of any commissions payable during the
         Deferral Period, as a flat dollar amount from any commissions payable
         during the Deferral Period, or in such other form as allowed by the
         Committee.

         3.3      Limitations on Deferral Commitments. The following limitations
shall apply to Deferral Commitments:

                  (a)      Minimum. The minimum deferral amount for a Salary,
         Bonus, or Commission Deferral Commitment shall be two thousand dollars
         ($2,000) per Deferral Period. If the Deferral Commitment is a Bonus
         Deferral Commitment or a Commission Deferral Commitment, the $2,000
         minimum shall be calculated as a percentage of targeted incentive bonus
         or commissions.

                  (b)      Maximum. The maximum deferral amount for a Salary
         Deferral Commitment shall be 100 percent (100%). The maximum deferral
         amount for a Bonus Deferral Commitment or a Commission Deferral
         Commitment shall be one hundred percent (100%) of any such bonus, or
         commission to be paid or payable during the Deferral Period. The
         maximum deferral amount may be adjusted pursuant to Section 4.2 to take
         into account any required withholdings with respect to the compensation
         being deferred.

                  (c)      Changes in Minimum or Maximum. The Committee may
         amend the Plan to change the minimum or maximum deferral amounts from
         time to time by giving written notice to all Participants. No such
         change may affect a Deferral Commitment made prior to the Committee's
         action.

         3.4      Modification of Deferral Commitment. A Deferral Commitment
shall be irrevocable except that the Committee shall permit a Participant to
reduce the amount to be deferred, or waive the remainder of the Deferral
Commitment upon a finding that the Participant has suffered a Financial
Hardship. If the Committee grants the application, the Participant will not be
allowed to enter into a new Deferral Commitment for the remainder of the
Deferral Period

in which the reduction or waiver of the Deferral Commitment occurs and the
following Deferral Period. Any resumption of the Participant's deferrals under
this Plan shall be made only at the election of the Participant in accordance
with this Article III.

                                   ARTICLE IV

                         DEFERRED COMPENSATION ACCOUNTS

         4.1      Accounts. For record keeping purposes only, separate accounts
shall be maintained for each Participant to reflect his or her Elective Deferral
Account (referred to herein as "Accounts"). Separate sub-accounts shall be
maintained to the extent necessary to properly reflect the Participant's
election of Earnings Indices under Sections 4.3 and 4.6.

         4.2      Elective Deferred Compensation. A Participant's Elective
Deferred Compensation shall be credited to the Participant's Elective Deferral
Account as the corresponding non-deferred portion of the Compensation becomes or
would have become payable. Any withholding of taxes or other amounts which is
required by state, federal or local law with respect to deferred Compensation
shall be withheld from the Participant's non-deferred Compensation to the
maximum extent possible with any excess reducing the amount deferred.

         4.3      Allocation of Accounts. A Participant shall allocate the
Accounts among the Earning Indices selected by the Committee. Such allocations
shall be made in whole percentage increments. The Committee may change the
Earnings Indices at any time. The Elective Deferral Account shall be treated as
if invested in the Earnings Indices chosen by the Participant. The Participant's
initial allocation shall be set forth in the Participation Agreement. If no
allocation is made in the Participation Agreement, the Participant's entire
account shall be initially allocated to the money market fund. A change in
allocation among Earning Indices will be allowed once each day in the form and
manner prescribed by the Committee. Changes made while the New York Stock
Exchange is open will be effective at the end of the day on which the change was
made. Changes made when the New York Stock Exchange is closed will be effective
at the end of the next day on which the New York Stock Exchange is open.

         4.4      Account Earnings. The Accounts of each Participant shall be
credited with earnings as if such Accounts were actually invested in the
Earnings Indices elected by the Participant pursuant to Section 4.3.

         4.5      Determination of Accounts. Each Participant's Elective
Deferral Account as of each day shall consist of the balance of such account as
of the immediately preceding day, plus (a) the Participant's Elective Deferred

                                 PLAN BENEFITS

         5.1      Prior to Termination of Employment. A Participant's Elective
Deferral Account may be distributed to the Participant prior to termination of
employment as follows:

                  (a)      Early Withdrawal. A Participant may elect in a
         Participation Agreement to withdraw all or any portion of the amount
         deferred by that Participation Agreement, and the earnings thereon, as
         of a date specified in the Participation Agreement. Such date shall not
         be sooner than two (2) years after the date the Deferral Period
         commences. Such election shall be made at the time the Deferral
         Commitment is made and shall be irrevocable.

                  (b)      Hardship Withdrawals. Upon a finding that a
         Participant has suffered a Financial Hardship, the Committee may, in
         its sole discretion, make distributions from the Participant's Elective
         Deferral Account. A Participant requesting a Hardship Withdrawal shall
         apply in writing to the Committee and shall provide such additional
         information as the Committee may require. The amount of the Hardship
         Withdrawal shall be limited to the amount reasonably necessary to meet
         the Participant's needs resulting from the Financial Hardship,
         including any amounts necessary to pay federal, state and/or local
         income taxes reasonably anticipated to result from the distribution.
         Upon requesting a Hardship Withdrawal, the Participant shall be
         required to change the investment direction of the Participant's
         Accounts to the money market fund. Immediately following a distribution
         due to Financial Hardship, or the determination by the Committee not to
         authorize a Hardship Withdrawal, the Participant may change the
         investment direction pursuant to Section 4.4. If a distribution is made
         due to Financial Hardship in accordance with this Section 5.1(b), the
         Participant's deferrals under this Plan shall cease for the remainder
         of the Deferral Period in which the Hardship Withdrawal occurs and the
         following Deferral Period. Any resumption of the Participant's
         deferrals under this Plan shall be made only at the election of the
         Participant in accordance with Article III herein.

                  (c)      Accelerated Distribution. Notwithstanding any other
         provision of this Plan, a Participant shall be entitled to receive,
         upon written request to the Committee, a lump sum distribution equal to
         ninety percent (90%) of the Participant's Elective Deferral valued as
         of the end of the day immediately preceding the date on which the
         Committee receives the written request ("Accelerated Distribution").
         The Participant shall forfeit the remaining balance of the
         Participant's Elective Deferral Account. Upon requesting an Accelerated
         Distribution, the Participant shall be required to change the
         investment direction


Deferred Compensation Plan                                                page 7
<PAGE>
         of the Participant's Accounts to the money market fund. After an
         Accelerated Distribution, the Participant's deferrals under this Plan
         shall cease for the remainder of the Deferral Period in which the
         Accelerated Distribution occurs, and the following Deferral Period. Any
         resumption of the Participant's deferrals under this Plan shall be made
         only at the election of the Participant in accordance with Article III
         herein.

         5.2      After Termination of Employment. Upon a Participant's
termination of employment with the Employer for any reason, the Participant
shall become entitled to receive the payment of the Participant's Elective
Deferral Account. The benefit will be paid in the form set forth in Section 5.3.

         5.3      Form of Benefit Payment. Benefits payable under Sections 5.1
and 5.2 shall be payable in the following form:

         under Section 5.1(a) will be paid as a lump sum or over four (4) years,
         pursuant to Section 5.4, as elected by the Participant in the
         Participation Agreement. Hardship Withdrawals under Section 5.1(b) will
         be paid in a lump sum within thirty (30) days after the Committee's
         decision. Accelerated Distributions under Section 5.1(c) will be paid
         in a lump sum within thirty (30) days of the receipt of the request by

         Change of Control. Benefits payable as a result of termination for any
         reason other than the Participant's Retirement or Disability or prior
         to a Change of Control of the Company shall be paid in a lump sum.
         Provided, however, that a Participant who terminates after having five
         (5) years of service with the Company shall be entitled to elect in the
         Participation Agreement to receive the benefit as a lump sum, or in
         substantially equal annual installments over two (2) or five (5) years.
         For purposes of this Section 5.3(b), years of service will be
         determined pursuant to Section 2.26(b).

         the time of the Deferral Commitment. Options for the form of benefit
         payment shall include:

                           (i)      A lump sum payment, or

                           (ii)     Substantially equal annual installments of
                  the Account over a period of two (2), five (5), ten (10), or
                  fifteen (15) years. Account Earnings shall continue to accrue
                  during the payment period on the unpaid balance in the
                  Participant's Accounts.

                  (d)      Death Benefits.

                           (i)      Upon the death of the Participant prior to
                  termination of employment, the Company shall pay to the
                  Participant's Beneficiary, as designated in Article VI, an
                  amount equal to the balance of the Participant's Elective
                  Deferral Account in the form selected by the Participant at
                  the time of the Deferral Commitment. Options for the form of
                  benefit payment shall include a lump sum payment or
                  substantially equal annual installments of the Participant's
                  Accounts over a period of two (2), five (5), ten (10) or
                  fifteen (15) years; provided, however, that any benefits
                  payable hereunder to a trust or estate shall be paid in a lump
                  sum. Account Earnings shall continue to accrue during the
                  payment period on the unpaid balance of the Participant's
                  Accounts. The Committee may, in its sole discretion, pay any
                  death benefit hereunder in the form of a lump sum.

                           (ii)     Upon the death of a Participant after
                  benefit payments have commenced, the Participant's Beneficiary
                  shall receive the remaining unpaid balance in the
                  Participant's Accounts in the same manner as the Participant
                  was being paid prior to the Participant's death; provided,
                  however, that any benefits payable hereunder to a trust or
                  estate shall be made in a lump sum. The Committee may, in its
                  sole discretion, pay any death benefit hereunder in the form
                  of a lump sum.

                  (e)      Small Account(s). Notwithstanding any provision of
         this Section 5.3 to the contrary, after a Participant becomes entitled
         to receive benefit payments, if the total amount of the Participant's
         Accounts is less than twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000) on a
         payment date, the Accounts shall be paid in a lump sum.

         5.4      Commencement of Benefit Payment. Except for Hardship
Withdrawals under Section 5.1(b) and Accelerated Distributions under Section
5.1(c), benefits payable in a lump sum shall be paid as soon as practicable
after January 1 of the year after termination of employment. Installment
benefits shall be paid annually as soon as practicable after January 1 each
year.

         5.5      Change of Election. Except for Early Withdrawals under Section
5.1(a), a Participant may change a previous election regarding the form of
benefit payment as long as the new election is filed with the Committee at least
twelve (12) full months prior to such Participant's termination of employment.
Any new election regarding the form of benefit payment that is filed with the
Committee during the twelve (12) months prior to the Participant's termination
of employment shall be ignored and reference shall be made to the prior filed
election in determining the form of benefit payment.

         5.6      Tax Withholding. To the extent required by federal, state, or
local law in effect at the time payments are made, the Employer shall withhold
from any amount that is included in the Participant's income hereunder any taxes
required to be withheld by such law(s).

         5.7      Valuation and Settlement. For distributions other than
Hardship Withdrawals under Section 5.1(b) and Accelerated Distributions under
Section 5.1(c), the amount of a lump sum payment and the amount of installments
shall be based on the value of the Participant's Accounts as of December 31 of
the year prior to the year in which the lump sum or installment is due.

         5.8      Payment to Guardian. The Committee may direct payment to the
duly appointed guardian, conservator, or other similar legal representative of a
Participant or Beneficiary to whom payment is due. In the absence of such a
legal representative, the Committee may, in its sole and absolute discretion,
make payment to a person having the care and custody of a minor, incompetent or
person incapable of handling the disposition of property upon proof satisfactory
to the Committee of incompetence, minority, or incapacity. Such distribution
shall completely discharge the Committee from all liability with respect to such
benefit.


                                   ARTICLE VI

                            BENEFICIARY DESIGNATION

         6.1      Beneficiary Designation. Subject to Section 6.3, each
Participant shall have the right, at any time, to designate one (1) or more
persons or an entity as Beneficiary (both primary as well as secondary) to whom
benefits under this Plan shall be paid in the event of such Participant's death
prior to complete distribution of the Participant's Accounts. Each Beneficiary
designation shall be in a written form prescribed by the Committee and shall be
effective only when filed with the Committee during the Participant's lifetime.

         6.2      Changing Beneficiary. Subject to Section 6.3, any Beneficiary
designation, other than the Participant's spouse, may be changed by a
Participant without the consent of the previously named Beneficiary by the
filing of a new Beneficiary designation with the Committee. The filing of a new
properly completed Beneficiary designation shall cancel all Beneficiary
designations previously filed.

         6.3      Community Property(i). If the Participant resides in a
community property state, any Beneficiary designation shall be valid or
effective only as permitted under applicable law.

         6.4      No Beneficiary Designation. If any Participant fails to
designate a Beneficiary in the manner provided in Section 6.1 and subject to
Section 6.3, if the Beneficiary designation is void, or if the Beneficiary
designated by a deceased Participant dies before the Participant or before
complete distribution of the Participant's Accounts, the Participant's
Beneficiary shall be the person in the first of the following classes in which
there is a survivor:

                  (a)      The Participant's spouse;

                  (b)      The Participant's children in equal shares, except
         that if any of the children predeceases the Participant but leaves
         issue surviving, then such issue shall take, by right of
         representation, the share the parent would have taken if living; or

                  (c)      The Participant's estate.

         7.1      Committee. This Plan shall be administered by the Committee,
which shall be made of not less than three members appointed by the Company's
CEO. The Committee shall have the discretionary authority to interpret and
enforce all appropriate rules and regulations for the administration of this

this Plan, as may arise. A majority vote of the Committee members shall control
any decision. Members of the Committee may be Participants under this Plan.

         7.2      Agents. The Committee may, from time to time, employ agents
and delegate to them such administrative duties as it sees fit, and may, from
time to time, consult with counsel who may be counsel to the Company.

Committee with respect to any question arising out of or in connection with the
administration, interpretation and application of this Plan and the rules and
regulations promulgated hereunder shall be final, conclusive and binding upon

         7.4      Indemnification of Committee. The Company shall indemnify and
hold harmless the members of the Committee against any and all claims, loss,
damage, expense or liability arising from any action or failure to act with

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                                CLAIMS PROCEDURE

         8.1      Claim. The Committee shall establish rules and procedures to
be followed by Participants and Beneficiaries in (a) filing claims for benefits,
and (b) for furnishing and verifying proofs necessary to establish the right to
benefits in accordance with this Plan, consistent with the remainder of this
Article VIII. Such rules and procedures shall require that claims and proofs be
made in writing and directed to the Committee.

         8.2      Review of Claim. The Committee shall review all claims for
benefits. Upon receipt by the Committee of such a claim, it shall determine all
facts which are necessary to establish the right of the claimant to benefits
under the provisions of this Plan and the amount thereof as herein provided
within ninety (90) days of receipt of such claim. If prior to the expiration of
the initial ninety (90) day period, the Committee determines additional time is
needed to come to a determination on the claim, the Committee shall provide
written notice to the Participant, Beneficiary or other claimant of the need for
the extension, not to exceed a total of one hundred eighty (180) days from the
date the application was received.

<PAGE>
         8.3      Notice of Denial of Claim. In the event that any Participant,
Beneficiary or other claimant claims to be entitled to a benefit under this
Plan, and the Committee determines that such claim should be denied, in whole or
in part, the Committee shall, in writing, notify such claimant that the claim
has been denied, in whole or in part, setting forth the specific reasons for
such denial. Such notification shall be written in a manner reasonably expected
to be understood by such claimant, shall refer to the specific sections of this
Plan relied on, shall describe any additional material or information necessary
for the claimant to perfect the claim, shall provide an explanation of why such
material or information is necessary, and, where appropriate, shall include an
explanation of how the claimant can obtain reconsideration of such denial.

         8.4      Reconsideration of Denied Claim.

                  (a)      Within sixty (60) days after receipt of the notice of
         the denial of a claim, such claimant or duly authorized representative
         may request, by mailing or delivery of such written notice to the
         Committee, a reconsideration by the Committee of the decision denying
         the claim. If the claimant or duly authorized representative fails to
         request such a reconsideration within such sixty (60) day period, it
         shall be conclusively determined for all purposes of this Plan that the
         denial of such claim by the Committee is correct. If such claimant or
         duly authorized representative requests a reconsideration within such
         sixty (60) day period, the claimant or duly authorized representative
         shall have thirty (30) days after filing a request for reconsideration
         to submit additional written material in support of the claim, review
         pertinent documents, and submit issues and comments in writing.

                  (b)      After such reconsideration request, the Committee
         shall determine within sixty (60) days of receipt of the claimant's
         request for reconsideration whether such denial of the claim was
         correct and shall notify such claimant in writing of its determination.
         The written notice of the Committee's decision shall be in writing and
         shall include specific reasons for the decision, shall be written in a
         manner reasonably calculated to be understood by the claimant, and
         shall identify specific references to the pertinent Plan provisions on
         which the decision is based. In the event of special circumstances
         determined by the Committee, the time for the Committee to make a
         decision may be extended by an additional sixty (60) days upon written
         notice to the claimant prior to the commencement of the extension.

         8.5      Employer to Supply Information. To enable the Committee to
perform its duties, the Employer shall supply full and timely information to the
Committee of all matters relating to the Retirement, Disability, death, or other
cause for termination of employment of all Participants, and such other
pertinent facts as the Committee may require.

<PAGE>
         9.1      Amendment. The Committee may at any time amend this Plan by
written instrument, notice of which is given to all Participants and to any
Beneficiaries to whom a benefit is due. No amendment shall reduce the amount
accrued in any Accounts as of the date such notice of the amendment is given.
Material changes to this Plan will be effective immediately, but must be
ratified and approved at the Compensation Committee meeting immediately
following the effective date of such amendment. After a Change of Control of the
Company, this Plan may not be amended without the consent of at least 75% of the
Participants.

         9.2      Right to Terminate Plan. Subject to 9.2(c) the Compensation
Committee may partially or completely terminate this Plan if, in its judgment,
the tax, accounting, or other effects of the continuance of this Plan would not
be in the best interests of the Employer.

                  (a)      Partial Termination. The Compensation Committee may
         partially terminate this Plan by instructing the Committee not to
         accept any additional Deferral Commitments. If such a partial
         termination occurs, this Plan shall continue to operate and be
         effective with regard to Deferral Commitments entered into prior to the
         effective date of such partial termination.

                  (b)      Complete Termination. The Compensation Committee may
         completely terminate this Plan by choosing not to accept any additional
         Deferral Commitments, and by terminating all ongoing Deferral
         Commitments. If such a complete termination occurs, this Plan shall
         cease to operate and the Employer shall pay out all Accounts. Payment
         shall be made in a lump sum within sixty (60) days after the
         Compensation Committee terminates this Plan.

                  (c)      Termination After Change of Control. After a Change
         of Control of the Company, this Plan may not be completely or partially
         terminated without the consent of at least 75% of the Participants.


                                   ARTICLE X

                                 MISCELLANEOUS

         10.1     Unfunded Plan. This Plan is an unfunded plan maintained
primarily to provide deferred compensation benefits for a select group of
management or highly compensated employees within the meaning of Sections 201,
301 and 401 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended
("ERISA"), and, therefore, is exempt from the provisions of Parts 2, 3 and 4 of
Title I of ERISA.

         10.2     Unsecured General Creditor. Participants and Beneficiaries
shall be unsecured general creditors, with no secured or preferential right to
any assets of the Company or any other party for payment of benefits under this
Plan. Any insurance contracts, mutual fund shares, stocks, bonds or other
property purchased by the Company in connection with this Plan shall remain the
Company's general, unpledged, and unrestricted assets. The Company's obligation
under this Plan shall be an unfunded and unsecured promise to pay money in the
future.

         10.3     Trust Fund. At its discretion, the Company may establish one
(1) or more trusts, with such trustees as the Committee may approve, for the
purpose of providing for the payment


Deferred Compensation Plan                                               page 13
<PAGE>
of benefits owed under this Plan. Although such a trust shall be irrevocable,
its assets shall be held for payment of all the Company's general creditors in
the event of the Company's insolvency or bankruptcy. To the extent any benefits
provided under this Plan are paid from any such trust, the Company shall have no
further obligation to pay them. If not paid from the trust, such benefits shall
remain the obligation of the Company. After the occurrence of a Change of
Control, the Company will deposit an amount in trust at least equal to the
amount necessary to cause the trust's assets to equal the total of all Accounts
under this Plan. Thereafter, the Company will make additional deposits, no less
often than monthly, as required to maintain trust assets at a level at least
equal the total of all Accounts under this Plan.

         10.4     Nonalienability. The Committee may recognize the right of an
alternate payee named in a domestic relations order to receive all or a portion
of a Participant's benefit under this Plan, provided that (a) the domestic
relations order would be a "qualified domestic relations order" within the
meaning of Code Section 414(p) if Code Section 414(p) were applicable to this
Plan; (b) the domestic relations order does not purport to give the alternate
payee any right to assets of the Company or its affiliates; and (c) the domestic
relations order does not purport to give the alternate payee any right to
receive payments under this Plan before the Participant is eligible to receive
such payments. If the domestic relations order purports to give the alternate
payee a share of a benefit to which the Participant currently has a contingent
or nonvested right, the alternate payee shall not be entitled to receive any
payment from this Plan with respect to the benefit unless the Participant's
right to the benefit becomes nonforfeitable. Except as set forth in the
preceding two sentences with respect to domestic relations orders, and except as
required under applicable federal, state, or local laws concerning the
withholding of tax, rights to benefits payable under this Plan are not subject
in any manner to anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge,
attachment or other legal process, or encumbrance of any kind. Any attempt to
alienate, sell, transfer, assign, pledge, or otherwise encumber any such
supplemental benefit, whether currently or thereafter payable, shall be void.

         10.5     Not a Contract of Employment. This Plan shall not constitute a
contract of employment between the Employer and the Participant. Nothing in this
Plan shall give a Participant the right to be retained in the service of the
Employer or to interfere with the right of the Employer to discipline or
discharge a Participant at any time.

         10.6     Protective Provisions. A Participant shall cooperate with the
Employer by furnishing any and all information and taking other actions as
requested by the Employer in order to facilitate the administration of this Plan
and the payment of benefits hereunder.

         10.7     Governing Law. The provisions of this Plan shall be construed
and interpreted according to the laws of the state of California, except as
preempted by federal law.

         10.8     Validity. In case any provision of this Plan shall be held
illegal or invalid for any reason, said illegality or invalidity shall not
affect the remaining parts hereof, but this Plan shall be construed and enforced
as if such illegal and invalid provision had never been inserted herein.

         10.9     Notice. Any notice required or permitted under this Plan shall
be sufficient if in writing and hand delivered or sent by registered or
certified mail. Such notice shall be deemed as given as of the date of delivery
or, if delivery is made by mail, as of the date shown on the

postmark on the receipt for registration or certification. Mailed notice to the
Committee shall be directed to the Company's address. Mailed notice to a
Participant or Beneficiary shall be directed to the individual's last known
address in the Employer's records.

         10.10    Successors. The provisions of this Plan shall bind and inure
to the benefit of the Company and its successors and assigns. The term
"successors" as used herein shall include any corporate or other business entity
which shall, whether by merger, consolidation, purchase or otherwise, acquire
all or substantially all of the business and assets of the Company, and
successors of any such corporation or other business entity.
