         Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Lenders
agree to make the credit facilities described in this Article 2 available to the
Borrowers for use for any purpose pursuant to Section 6.2 from time to time
during the term of this Agreement. The credit facilities shall be composed of a

Acceptances, and a term loan in an initial principal amount of $20,000,000.

     Section 2.1 Revolving Commitments.

          (a) Amounts. Subject to the satisfaction of the conditions precedent
     set forth in Article 4, each Lender severally, but not jointly, agrees,
     upon a Borrower's request from time to time on any Business Day during the
     period from the Closing Date to the Facility Termination Date, to make
     Credit Extensions to, or for the account of, the applicable Borrower in an
     aggregate amount not in excess of such Lender's Revolving Pro Rata Share of
     the applicable Borrowing Base, except for Collateral Protection Advances.
     The Lenders, however, in their unanimous discretion, may elect to make
     Credit Extensions in excess of the applicable Borrowing Base on one or more
     occasions, but if they do so, neither the Agent nor the Lenders shall be
     deemed thereby to have changed the limits of any Borrowing Base or to be

     the making of Credit Extensions, subject to the Agent's authority, in its
     sole discretion, to make Collateral Protection

         Advances pursuant to the terms of Section 2.1(i). Subject to the terms
         of this Agreement, the Borrowers may borrow, repay, and reborrow
         Revolving Loans at any time prior to the Facility Termination Date.

          (b) Increase of Aggregate Revolving Commitment.

               (i) Upon notice to the Agent (who shall promptly notify the
          Lenders), the Borrowers may, from time to time, request increases in
          the Aggregate Revolving Commitment in an aggregate amount of up to
          $25,000,000; provided that any such increase shall not increase the
          maximum amount of Loans available to K2 Canada or the U.K. Borrowers
          and shall be in a minimum amount of $10,000,000 and integral multiples
          of $5,000,000 in excess thereof. At the time of sending such notice,
          the Borrowers (in consultation with the Agent) shall specify the time
          period (not less than 10 days) within which each Lender is requested
          to respond to such request. Each Lender shall respond within such time
          period to the Agent whether or not it agrees to increase its Revolving
          Commitment and, if so, whether by an amount equal to or less than its
          Revolving Pro Rata Share of such requested increase. Any Lender not
          responding within such time period shall be deemed to have declined to
          increase its Revolving Commitment. The Agent shall notify the
          Borrowers and each Lender of the Lenders' responses to each request
          made hereunder. To achieve the full amount of a requested increase,
          the Borrowers may also (i) request that one or more other Lenders, in
          their sole and absolute discretion, nonratably increase their
          Revolving Commitment, and/or (ii) invite additional lending
          institutions which otherwise qualify as Purchasers under Section 12.3
          to become Lenders under the terms of this Agreement. In connection
          with the foregoing, each of the Lenders agrees to execute and deliver
          such amendments or other agreements as are reasonably required to give
          effect to the adjustment of such Lender's Revolving Commitment or of
          the Aggregate Revolving Commitment. Any new Purchaser added as a
          Lender pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be required to have a
          Revolving Commitment of not less than $5,000,000. In connection with
          each increase in any Lender's Revolving Commitment pursuant to this
          Section 2.1(b) and each addition of a new Lender, the Borrowers shall
          pay to the Agent, for its own account, a fee of $3,500 for processing
          such increase and addition.

               (ii) If any requested increase in the Revolving Commitments is
          agreed to in accordance with clause (i) preceding, the Agent and the
          Borrowers shall determine the effective date of such increase (the
          "Increase Effective Date"). The Agent, with the consent and approval
          of the Borrowers, shall promptly confirm in writing to the Lenders the
          final allocation of such increase and the Increase Effective Date. As
          a condition precedent to the effectiveness of such increase, the
          Borrowers shall deliver to the Agent a certificate dated as of the
          Increase Effective Date (in sufficient copies for each Lender) signed
          by a responsible officer of the Parent on behalf of all of the
          Borrowers, including a Compliance Certificate demonstrating compliance
          with the terms of this Agreement and certification that, before and
          after giving effect to such increase, the representations and
          warranties contained in Article 5 are true and correct in all

CREDIT AGREEMENT  Page 35


<PAGE>

          material respects on and as of the Increase Effective Date (except to
          the extent any such representation or warranty is stated to
          relate solely to an earlier date) and no Default or Unmatured Default
          exists. Upon the request of any Lender, the Borrowers shall deliver a
          new or amended Note reflecting the new or increased Revolving
          Commitment of each new or affected Lender as of the Increase Effective
          Date. The Borrowers shall prepay any Revolving Loans which are
          Eurodollar Loans and which are outstanding on the Increase Effective
          Date (and pay any costs incurred in connection with such prepayment
          pursuant to Section 3.4) to the extent necessary to keep the
          outstanding Revolving Loans ratable with any revised Revolving Pro
          Rata Shares arising from any nonratable increase in the Revolving
          Commitments.

          (iii) This Section 2.1(b) shall supersede any provisions of Section
     8.2.

     (c) Procedure for Borrowing.

          (i) Each Advance shall be made upon a Borrower's written notice
     delivered to the Agent in the form of Exhibit C (a "Borrowing Notice"), or
     upon telephonic notice pursuant to Section 2.7, which must be received by
     the Agent prior to 12:00 noon (Chicago, Illinois time) (x) three Business
     Days prior to the requested Borrowing Date, in the case of any Eurodollar
     Advance, (y) on the requested Borrowing Date, in the case of any Floating
     Rate Advance requested by a U.S. Borrower, and (z) three Business Days
     prior to the requested Borrowing Date, in the case of any Floating Rate
     Advance requested by K2 Canada or a U.K. Borrower. Each Borrowing Notice
     shall specify (A) the Borrowing Date (which shall be a Business Day) of
     such Advance, (B) the amount of the Advance requested, which (1) in the
     case of Eurodollar Advances shall be in an amount that is not less than
     $1,500,000 or an integral multiple of $500,000 in excess thereof, (2) in
     the case of Floating Rate Advances to K2 Canada or a U.K. Borrower shall be
     in an amount that is not less than $500,000 or an integral multiple of
     $250,000 in excess thereof, or (3) in the case of Floating Rate Advances to
     the U.S. Borrowers shall be in an amount that is not less than $50,000 or
     an integral multiple of $10,000 in excess thereof (other than a Floating
     Rate Advance made pursuant to Section 2.15 or which is used to repay
     NonRatable Loans which may be in the amount of the Non-Ratable Loans being
     repaid), (C) the Type of Advance requested; provided that if such Borrower
     fails to specify the Type of Advance requested, such request shall be
     deemed a request for a Floating Rate Advance, and (D) the duration of the
     Interest Period if the Type of Advance requested is a Eurodollar Advance;
     provided that if such Borrower fails to select the duration of the Interest
     Period requested for any Eurodollar Advance, such Borrower shall be deemed
     to have requested such Eurodollar Advance be made with an Interest Period
     of one month in duration.

          (ii) The Borrowers shall have no right to request a Eurodollar Advance
     while any Default or Unmatured Default exists.

CREDIT AGREEMENT  Page 36


<PAGE>

          (d) Funding Account. The Borrowers shall deliver to the Agent, on the
     Closing Date, a notice setting forth the deposit accounts of the Borrowers
     (each a "Funding Account") to which the Agent is authorized by the
     Borrowers to transfer the proceeds of the Advances requested hereunder. A
     separate Funding Account shall be designated for each of K2 Canada
     (individually), the U.K. Borrowers (collectively), and the U.S. Borrowers
     (collectively). The Borrowers may designate a replacement Funding Account
     (as applicable) from time to time by written notice to the Agent. Any
     designation by the Borrowers of the Funding Account must be reasonably
     acceptable to the Agent.

          (e) Reliance Upon Authority; No Liability. The Agent is entitled to
     rely conclusively on any individual's request for Advances hereunder, so
     long as the proceeds thereof are to be transferred to the applicable
     Funding Account. The Agent shall have no duty to verify the identity of any
     individual representing himself or herself as a person authorized by any
     Borrower to make such requests on its behalf. The Agent shall not incur any
     liability to the Borrowers as a result of acting upon any notice referred
     to in Section 2.1(c), Section 2.1(d), Section 2.6, and Section 2.7 which
     the Agent reasonably believes to have been given by an officer or other
     person duly authorized by a Borrower to request Advances on its behalf or
     for otherwise acting under this Agreement. The crediting of Advances to the
     applicable Funding Account shall conclusively establish the obligation of
     the applicable Borrowers to repay such Advances as provided herein.

          (f) The Agent's Election. Subject to the requirements of Section
     2.1(g), promptly after receipt of a Borrowing Notice (or telephonic notice
     in lieu thereof) of a requested Floating Rate Advance from the U.S.
     Borrowers, the Agent shall elect in its discretion to have the terms of
     Section 2.1(g) or Section 2.1(h) apply to such requested Advance. If Bank
     One declines in its sole discretion to make a Non-Ratable Loan pursuant to
     Section 2.1(h), the terms of Section 2.1(g) shall apply to the requested
     Advance.

          (g) Making of Advances. If the Agent elects to have the terms of this
     Section 2.1(g) apply to a requested Floating Rate Advance or if a requested
     Advance is for a Eurodollar Advance, then promptly after receipt of a
     Borrowing Notice or telephonic notice in lieu thereof, the Agent shall
     notify the Lenders by telecopy, telephone, or email of the requested
     Advance. Each Lender shall transfer its Revolving Pro Rata Share of the
     requested Advance to the Agent in immediately available funds, to the
     account from time to time designated by the Agent, not later than 2:00 p.m.
     (Chicago, Illinois time) on the applicable Borrowing Date. After the
     Agent's receipt of all proceeds of such requested Advance, the Agent shall
     make the proceeds of such requested Advance available to the applicable
     Borrower on the applicable Borrowing Date by transferring same day funds to
     the applicable Funding Account; provided, however, that the amount of
     Credit Extensions made to the Borrowers on any Borrowing Date shall not
     exceed the Unused Availability on such date, may not cause the Aggregate
     Outstanding Revolving Credit Exposure to exceed the Aggregate Revolving
     Commitment, and shall not cause the aggregate amount of Credit Extensions
     outstanding to K2 Canada, the U.K. Borrowers, or the U.S. Borrowers to
     exceed the Canadian Borrowing Base, the U.K.

CREDIT AGREEMENT  Page 37


<PAGE>

    Borrowing Base, or the U.S. Borrowing Base (as applicable) after giving
    effect to any such Credit Extension.

          (h) Making of Non-Ratable Loans. Subject to Section 2.1(f), if the
     Agent elects, with the consent of Bank One, to have the terms of this
     Section 2.1(h) apply to a requested Floating Rate Advance requested by any
     U.S. Borrower, Bank One shall make an Advance in the amount requested
     available to the U.S. Borrowers on the applicable Borrowing Date by
     transferring same day funds to the applicable Funding Account. Each advance
     made solely by Bank One pursuant to this Section 2.1(h) is referred to in
     this Agreement as a "Non-Ratable Loan," and such Advances are referred to
     as the "Non-Ratable Loans." Each Non-Ratable Loan shall be subject to all
     the terms and conditions applicable to other Advances funded by the
     Lenders, except that all payments thereon shall be payable to Bank One
     solely for its own account. The aggregate amount of Non-Ratable Loans
     outstanding at any time shall not exceed $10,000,000. The Agent shall not
     request Bank One to make any Non-Ratable Loan if (A) the Agent has received
     written notice from any Lender that one or more of the applicable
     conditions precedent set forth in Article 4 will not be satisfied on the
     requested Borrowing Date for the applicable Non-Ratable Loan, or (B) the
     requested Non-Ratable Loan exceeds the Unused Availability (before giving
     effect to such Non-Ratable Loan) or would cause the Aggregate Outstanding
     Revolving Credit Exposure (after giving effect to such Non-Ratable Loan) to
     exceed the Aggregate Revolving Commitment on the applicable Borrowing Date.
     The Non-Ratable Loans shall be secured by the Liens granted to the Agent in
     and to the Facility Collateral and shall constitute Obligations hereunder.
     All Non-Ratable Loans shall be Floating Rate Advances.

          (i) Collateral Protection Advances. Subject to the limitations set
     forth below, the Agent is authorized by the Borrowers and the Lenders, from
     time to time in the Agent's sole discretion, (i) during the existence of a
     Default or (ii) at any time that any of the other conditions precedent set
     forth in Article 4 have not been satisfied, to make Advances (each such
     Advance to be a Floating Rate Advance) to any of the Borrowers on behalf of
     the Lenders in an aggregate amount outstanding at any time not to exceed,
     at the time of making such Advance, the lesser of 10.0% of the aggregate
     amount of the Borrowing Base or $10,000,000 which the Agent, in its
     reasonable business judgment, deems necessary or desirable (A) to preserve
     or protect the Facility Collateral, or any portion thereof, (B) to enhance
     the likelihood of, or maximize the amount of, repayment of the Loans and
     other Obligations, or (C) to pay any other amount chargeable to or required
     to be paid by the Borrowers pursuant to the terms of this Agreement,
     including costs, fees, and expenses as described in Section 9.6 (any of
     such Advances are herein referred to as "Collateral Protection Advances");
     provided that the Required Lenders may at any time revoke the Agent's
     authorization to make Collateral Protection Advances. Any such revocation
     must be in writing and shall become effective prospectively upon the
     Agent's receipt thereof. Absent such revocation, the Agent's determination
     that the making of a Collateral Protection Advance is required for any such
     purposes shall be conclusive. The Collateral Protection Advances shall be
     secured by the Liens in favor of the Agent in and to the Facility
     Collateral and shall constitute Obligations hereunder. All Collateral
     Protection Advances shall be Floating Rate Advances.

     Section 2.2 Term Loans B. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, each Lender designated on the signature pages hereof as holding any
commitment with respect to the Term Loans B, severally agrees to make a Loan on
the Closing Date to the U.S. Borrowers, each in an amount equal to such Lender's
Term Loan B as specified opposite such Lender's name on its signature page
hereto. The aggregate amount of the Term Loans B on the Closing Date shall be
equal to $20,000,000.

     Section 2.3 Evidence of Indebtedness; Noteless Agreement.

          (a) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice
     an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrowers to such
     Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender from time to time,
     including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such
     Lender from time to time hereunder.

          (b) The Agent shall also maintain accounts in which it will record (i)
     the amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Type thereof, and the Interest
     Period with respect thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest
     due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrowers to each
     Lender hereunder, (iii) the original stated amount of each Facility LC and
     the amount of LC Obligations outstanding at any time (which shall be to the
     knowledge of the Agent where it is not the LC Issuer), (iv) the original
     amount of each Acceptance and the amount of the Acceptance Obligations
     outstanding at any time (which shall be to the knowledge of the Agent where
     it is not the Acceptance Lender), and (v) the amount of any sum received by
     the Agent hereunder from the Borrowers and each Lender's share thereof.

          (c) The entries maintained in the accounts maintained pursuant to
     clause (a) and clause (b) preceding shall be prima facie evidence of the
     existence and amounts of the Obligations therein recorded; provided,
     however, that the failure of the Agent or any Lender to maintain such
     accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation
     of the Borrowers to repay the Obligations in accordance with their terms.

          (d) Any Lender may request that its Loans be evidenced by one or more
     promissory notes representing its Revolving Loans and Term Loans B,
     respectively, substantially in the form of Exhibit A, with appropriate
     changes (each such promissory note being referred to herein as a "Note").
     In such event, the Borrowers shall execute and deliver to such Lender such
     Note or Notes payable to the order of such Lender. Thereafter, the Loans
     evidenced by each such Note and interest thereon shall at all times (prior
     to any assignment pursuant to Section 12.3) be represented by one or more
     Notes payable to the order of the payee named therein, except to the extent
     that any such Lender subsequently returns any such Note for cancellation
     and requests that such Loans once again be evidenced as described in clause
     (a) and clause (b) preceding.

     Section 2.4 Facility LCs and Acceptances.

          (a) Issuance and Creation. Each of the Lenders, if and to the extent
     acting as the LC Issuer or Acceptance Lender hereunder (it being agreed and
     understood that an Acceptance may or may not be accepted for payment by an
     Acceptance Lender in

CREDIT AGREEMENT  Page 39


<PAGE>

     accordance with the underlying application, agreement, or Letter of
     Credit), hereby agrees, on the terms and conditions set forth in this
     Agreement, to issue standby and commercial letters of credit (each, a
     "Facility LC") and to renew, extend, increase, decrease, or otherwise
     modify each Facility LC ("Modify" and each such action a "Modification") or
     to accept or create (or cause or deem to be accepted or created)
     Acceptances hereunder, in each case from time to time from and including
     the Closing Date and prior to the Facility Termination Date upon the
     request of the Parent in support of obligations of any Obligated Party or,
     up to an aggregate amount outstanding at any time not in excess of
     $15,000,000, any Subsidiary of the Parent which is not an Obligated Party;
     provided that immediately after each such Facility LC is issued or Modified
     or such Acceptance is accepted or created (or deemed accepted or created),
     (i) the aggregate amount of the outstanding LC Obligations and Acceptance
     Obligations shall not exceed $75,000,000, and (ii) the sum (without
     duplication) of all Loans to the U.S. Borrowers, plus all LC Obligations,
     plus all Acceptance Obligations shall not exceed the U.S. Borrowing Base.
     No Facility LC shall have an expiry date later than the earlier of (y) the
     fifth Business Day prior to the Facility Termination Date or (z) one year
     after its issuance; provided that, subject to clause (y) preceding, any
     Facility LC with an original one year term may provide for automatic
     renewals thereof for up to one year. With respect to any Facility LC which
     provides for automatic renewal of such Facility LC, each Lender shall be
     deemed to have consented to any such extension or renewal unless such
     Lender shall have provided to the Agent written notice that such Lender
     declines to consent to any such extension or renewal at least 30 days prior
     to the date on which the LC Issuer is entitled to decline to extend or
     renew the Facility LC; provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, if all
     of the requirements of this Section 2.4(a) are met and no Default or
     Unmatured Default exists, no Lender may decline to consent to any such
     extension or renewal.

          (b) Participations. Upon the issuance or Modification by the LC Issuer
     of a Facility LC or the creation or deemed creation of an Acceptance by the
     Acceptance Lender, in each case in accordance with this Section 2.4, the LC
     Issuer or the Acceptance Lender, as applicable, shall be deemed, without
     further action by any party hereto, to have unconditionally and irrevocably
     sold to each Lender, and each Lender shall be deemed, without further
     action by any party hereto, to have unconditionally and irrevocably
     purchased from the LC Issuer or the Acceptance Lender, as applicable, a
     participation in such Facility LC (and each Modification thereof) or
     Acceptance, as applicable, and the related LC Obligations or Acceptance
     Obligations in proportion to its Revolving Pro Rata Share. Each Lender
     acknowledges and agrees that each such participation in a Facility LC (and
     each Modification thereof) or Acceptance, as applicable, and its payment
     and other obligations with respect thereto: (i) is absolute and
     unconditional; (ii) shall remain and continue in full force and effect
     without regard (A) to any waiver, modification, extension, renewal,
     amendment or restatement of any other term or provision of any Facility LC
     or Acceptance, (B) to any act or circumstance respecting any Facility LC or
     Acceptance consented to or waived by any Borrower, (C) to any full,
     partial, or nonexercise of any of the rights, powers, privileges,
     remedies, and interests of the LC Issuer or Acceptance Lender respecting
     any Facility LC or Acceptance or under any related application, any Loan
     Document or applicable law, against any Person or with respect to any
     Facility Collateral, (D) to any Default or

CREDIT AGREEMENT  Page 40


<PAGE>

     Unmatured Default, whenever occurring or continuing, or (E) to any act
     or omission on the part of the LC Issuer or Acceptance Lender, the Agent,
     any Lender, or any other Person; (iii) shall not be subject to any defense,
     counterclaim, set off, right of recoupment, abatement, reduction, or other
     claim or determination that such Lender may have against the Agent, any
     other Lender, any Borrower, or any other Person; and (iv) shall not be
     diminished or qualified by the death, disability, dissolution,
     reorganization, insolvency, bankruptcy, custodianship, or receivership of
     the LC Issuer, the Acceptance Lender, any Lender, any Borrower, any other
     coobligor, guarantor, surety or pledgor, or any other Person, or the
     inability of any of them to pay its debts or perform or otherwise satisfy
     its obligations as they become due for any reason whatsoever.

          (c) Notice of Facility LCs. Subject to Section 2.4(a), the Parent
     shall give the LC Issuer notice prior to 12:00 noon (Chicago, Illinois
     time) at least three Business Days prior to the proposed date of issuance
     or Modification of each Facility LC, specifying the beneficiary, the
     proposed date of issuance (or Modification), and the expiry date of such
     Facility LC, and describing the proposed terms of such Facility LC and the
     nature of the transactions proposed to be supported thereby. Upon receipt
     of such notice, the LC Issuer shall promptly notify the Agent, and the
     Agent shall notify each Lender (at the time of a Settlement pursuant to
     Section 2.17), of the contents thereof and of the amount of such Lender's
     participation in such proposed Facility LC. The issuance or Modification by
     the LC Issuer of any Facility LC shall, in addition to the conditions
     precedent set forth in Article 4 (the satisfaction of which the LC Issuer
     shall have no duty to ascertain), be subject to the conditions precedent
     that such Facility LC shall be satisfactory to the LC Issuer and that the
     Parent shall have executed and delivered such application agreement and/or
     such other instruments and agreements relating to such Facility LC as the
     LC Issuer shall have reasonably requested (each, a "Facility LC
     Application"). In the event of any conflict between the terms of this
     Agreement and the terms of any Facility LC Application, the terms of this
     Agreement shall control.

          (d) Facility LC Administration; Reimbursement by the Lenders. Upon
     receipt from the beneficiary of any Facility LC of any demand for payment
     under such Facility LC, the LC Issuer shall notify the Agent and the Parent
     as to the amount to be paid by the LC Issuer as a result of such demand and
     the proposed payment date (the "LC Payment Date"). The responsibility of
     the LC Issuer to the Parent and the Lenders shall be only to determine that
     the documents (including each demand for payment) delivered under each
     Facility LC in connection with such presentment shall be in conformity in
     all material respects with such Facility LC. The LC Issuer shall endeavor
     to exercise the same care in the issuance and administration of the
     Facility LCs as it does with respect to letters of credit in which no
     participations are granted, it being understood that in the absence of any
     gross negligence or willful misconduct by the LC Issuer, each Lender shall
     be unconditionally and irrevocably liable, without regard to the occurrence
     of any Default, Unmatured Default, or any condition precedent whatsoever,
     to reimburse the LC Issuer on demand for (i) such Lender's Revolving Pro
     Rata Share of the amount of each payment made by the LC Issuer under each
     Facility LC to the extent such amount is not reimbursed by the Parent
     pursuant to Section 2.4(e), plus (ii) interest on the foregoing amount to
     be reimbursed by such Lender, for each day from the date of the LC Issuer's

CREDIT AGREEMENT  Page 41


<PAGE>

     demand for such reimbursement (or, if such demand is made after 1:00
     p.m. (Chicago, Illinois time) on such date, from the next succeeding
     Business Day) to the date on which such Lender pays the amount to be
     reimbursed by it, at a rate of interest per annum equal to the Federal
     Funds Effective Rate for the first three days and, thereafter, at a rate of
     interest equal to the rate applicable to Floating Rate Advances.

          (e) Reimbursement by the Parent. The Parent shall be irrevocably and
     unconditionally obligated to reimburse the LC Issuer on the applicable LC
     Payment Date for any amounts to be paid by the LC Issuer upon any drawing
     under any Facility LC, without presentment, demand, protest, or other
     formalities of any kind; provided that neither the Parent nor any Lender
     shall hereby be precluded from asserting any claim for direct (but not
     consequential) damages suffered by the Parent or such Lender to the extent,
     but only to the extent, caused by (i) the willful misconduct or gross
     negligence of the LC Issuer in determining whether a request presented
     under any Facility LC issued by it complied with the terms of such Facility
     LC or (ii) the LC Issuer's failure to pay under any Facility LC issued by
     it after the presentation to it of a request strictly complying with the
     terms and conditions of such Facility LC. All such amounts paid by the LC
     Issuer and remaining unpaid by the Parent shall bear interest, payable on
     demand, for each day until paid at a rate per annum equal to (y) the rate
     applicable to Floating Rate Advances for such day if such day falls on or
     before the applicable LC Payment Date and (z) the sum of 2.00%, plus the
     rate applicable to Floating Rate Advances for such day if such day falls
     after such LC Payment Date. The LC Issuer will pay to each Lender ratably
     in accordance with its Revolving Pro Rata Share all amounts received by the
     LC Issuer from the Parent for application in payment, in whole or in part,
     of the Reimbursement Obligation in respect of any Facility LC issued by the
     LC Issuer, but only to the extent such Lender has made payment to the LC
     Issuer in respect of such Facility LC pursuant to Section 2.4(d). Subject
     to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including, without
     limitation, the submission of a Borrowing Notice in compliance with Section
     2.1(c) and the satisfaction of the applicable conditions precedent set
     forth in Article 4), the Parent may request an Advance hereunder for the
     purpose of satisfying any Reimbursement Obligation.

          (f) Acceptance, Creation and Additional Acceptance Provisions.

               (i) In the event a LC Issuer accepts a LC Application from the
          Parent calling for acceptance (rather than immediate payment) on
          presentment, then upon due presentment to the LC Issuer by the
          beneficiary under any Facility LC of a time draft in accordance
          therewith and herewith, (A) the LC Issuer shall be deemed to be an
          Acceptance Lender, (B) the LC Issuer shall accept the draft presented
          by the beneficiary of the Facility LC in accordance with the terms
          thereof and hereof (which may be by way of notice to the beneficiary
          or delivery of the Acceptance), (C) the accepted draft of the
          beneficiary shall be deemed to be an Acceptance, and (D) the
          Acceptance Lender shall provide notice to the Agent of creation of
          such Acceptance. The amount of the Acceptance shall be equal to the
          face amount of the beneficiary's draft.

CREDIT AGREEMENT  Page 42


<PAGE>

                    (ii) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the
               Acceptance Lender shall not be required to accept any draft that
               (A) did not arise out of the purchase or sale of goods by any
               Borrower in the ordinary course of its business, (B) arose out of
               a purchase from or sale to an Affiliate of any Borrower, (C)
               involves any purchase or sale for which each of the Agent and the
               Acceptance Lender has not received all related documents,
               instruments, and forms requested by either the Agent or the
               Acceptance Lender, or (D) is not eligible for discounting with
               Federal Reserve Banks pursuant to paragraph 7 of Section 13 of
               the Federal Reserve Act, as amended.

                    (iii) The Acceptance Lender shall pay the amount of the
               Acceptance on maturity to the presenting Facility LC beneficiary
               or its assignee (if not previously discounted by the beneficiary
               to the Acceptance Lender). The Acceptance Lender may in its
               discretion discount the Acceptance for the presenting Facility LC
               beneficiary at its request, which may be subject to such interest
               (discount) rate for the applicable maturity period and other
               charges as such beneficiary and the Acceptance Lender may agree.
               The Lenders shall not participate in such interest (discount)
               rate and charges.

                    (iv) The Parent shall pay to the Acceptance Lender the
               amount of any Acceptance on its maturity date. In addition, each
               of the Agent and the Acceptance Lender is hereby irrevocably
               authorized, in its sole discretion, to cause the Lenders to make
               Revolving Loans to the U.S. Borrowers (and the U.S. Borrowers
               agree to request and accept such Revolving Loans for all purposes
               of this Agreement) from time to time, or to charge any account of
               the U.S. Borrowers, to pay any Acceptance for which payment is
               due, or at any time after the occurrence of a Default to fund
               cash collateral for any outstanding Acceptance.

                    (v) Each Acceptance shall be payable in Dollars and shall be
               in the face amount of at least $10,000. The maturity of each
               Acceptance shall be in any 30 day increment equal to or greater
               than 30 days and less than or equal to 180 days or, if such
               maturity date is not a Business Day, on the next succeeding
               Business Day and, in any event, no later than the fifth Business
               Day prior to the Facility Termination Date.

                    (vi) The Parent and other Borrowers acknowledge and agree
               that none of the Acceptance Lender, the LC Issuer (except in so
               far as this Agreement provides otherwise with respect to a LC
               Issuer's liability for a Facility LC issued by it), the Agent, or
               any Lender, and none of their respective affiliates,
               correspondents, custodians, participants, and representatives,
               shall be responsible or have any liability for: (A) the
               existence, character, quantity, quality, condition, packing,
               value, or delivery of any goods or other property relating to any
               draft or Acceptance; (B) the validity, sufficiency, or
               genuineness of any documents or endorsements or other notations
               thereon; (C) the time, place, manner, or order in which shipment
               is made; (D) any insurance or insurer; or (E) any act or omission

CREDIT AGREEMENT  Page 43


<PAGE>

               of any shipper, warehouseman, carrier, correspondent, or
               other party involved in any transaction related to any draft or
               Acceptance.

          (g) Obligations Absolute. The Parent's obligations under this Section
     2.4 shall be absolute and unconditional under any and all circumstances and
     irrespective of any setoff, counterclaim, or defense to payment which the
     Parent may have or have had against the LC Issuer, the Acceptance Lender,
     any Lender, or any beneficiary of a Facility LC, and irrespective of
     whether any such party has received notice or otherwise has knowledge of
     the same. Each of the Parent and the other Borrowers further agrees with
     the LC Issuer, the Acceptance Lender and the Lenders that (i) neither the
     Parent nor any other Borrower can request or stop payment under any
     Facility LC or Acceptance in accordance with its terms and (ii) the Agent,
     the LC Issuer, the Acceptance Lender, and the Lenders shall not be
     responsible for, and the LC Obligation or Acceptance Obligation in respect
     of any Facility LC or Acceptance shall not be affected by, among other
     things, (A) the validity or genuineness of documents or of any endorsements
     thereon, even if such documents should in fact prove to be in any or all
     respects invalid, fraudulent, or forged, (B) any dispute between or among
     the Parent, any of its Affiliates, the beneficiary of any Facility LC or
     Acceptance, or any financial institution or other party to whom any
     Facility LC or Acceptance may be transferred, or (C) any claims or defenses
     whatsoever of the Parent or of any of its Affiliates against the
     beneficiary of any Facility LC or Acceptance or any such transferee.
     Neither the Agent, the LC Issuer, the Acceptance Lender, or any Lender
     shall be liable for any error, omission, interruption, or delay in
     transmission, dispatch, or delivery of any message or advice, however
     transmitted, in connection with any Facility LC or Acceptance. The Parent
     agrees that any action taken or omitted by the Agent, the LC Issuer, the
     Acceptance Lender, or any Lender under or in connection with each Facility
     LC or Acceptance and the related drafts and documents, if done without
     gross negligence or willful misconduct, shall be binding upon the Parent
     and shall not put the Agent, the LC Issuer, the Acceptance Lender, or any
     Lender under any liability to the Parent. Nothing in this Section 2.4(g) is
     intended to limit the right of the Parent to make a claim against the LC
     Issuer for damages as contemplated by the proviso to the first sentence of
     Section 2.4(e).

          (h) Actions of the LC Issuer and the Acceptance Lender. The LC Issuer
     and the Acceptance Lender shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully
     protected in relying, upon any Facility LC, Acceptance, draft, writing,
     resolution, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, cablegram,
     telegram, telecopy, telex or teletype message, statement, order, or other
     document believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed,
     sent, or made by the proper Person or Persons, and upon advice and
     statements of legal counsel, independent accountants, and other experts
     selected by the LC Issuer or the Acceptance Lender, as applicable. The LC
     Issuer and the Acceptance Lender shall be fully justified in failing or
     refusing to take any action under this Agreement unless it shall first have
     received such advice or concurrence of the Required Lenders as it
     reasonably deems appropriate or it shall first be indemnified to its
     reasonable satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all liability and
     expense which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to
     take any such action. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section
     2.4, the LC Issuer and the Acceptance Lender shall in all cases be fully
     protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this Agreement in
     accordance with

CREDIT AGREEMENT  Page 44


<PAGE>

     a request of the Required Lenders, and such request and any action
     taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon the Lenders
     and any future holders of a participation in any Facility LC or Acceptance.

          (i) Inventory Financed with Facility LCs and Acceptances.

               (i) During the existence of any Default, in connection with all
          Inventory financed for any Obligated Party with any Facility LC or
          Acceptance, each Obligated Party hereby appoints the Agent, or the
          Agent's designee, as its attorney, with full power and authority: (A)
          to sign and/or endorse such Obligated Party's name upon any warehouse
          or other receipts; (B) to sign such Obligated Party's name on bills of
          lading and other negotiable and nonnegotiable documents; (C) to clear
          Inventory through customs in the Agent's or such Obligated Party's
          name, and to sign and deliver to customs officials powers of attorney
          in such Obligated Party's name for such purpose; (D) to complete in
          such Obligated Party's or the Agent's name, any order, sale, or
          transaction, obtain the necessary documents in connection therewith,
          and collect the proceeds thereof; and (E) to do such other acts and
          things as are necessary in order to enable the Agent to obtain
          possession or control of such Inventory and to obtain payment of the
          Obligations. Neither the Agent nor its designee, as such Obligated
          Party's attorney, will be liable for any acts or omissions, nor for
          any error of judgment or mistakes of fact or law other than for gross
          negligence or willful misconduct. This power, being coupled with an
          interest, is irrevocable until all Obligations have been paid and
          satisfied.

               (ii) During the existence of any Default, in connection with all
          Inventory financed by any Facility LC or Acceptance, each Obligated
          Party will, at the Agent's request, instruct all suppliers, carriers,
          forwarders, customs brokers, warehouses, or others receiving or
          holding cash, checks, Inventory, documents, or instruments in which
          the Agent holds a security interest to deliver them to the Agent
          and/or subject to the Agent's order, and if they shall come into any
          Obligated Party's possession, to deliver them, upon request, to the
          Agent in their original form. Each Obligated Party shall also, at the
          Agent's request, designate the Agent as the consignee on all bills of
          lading and other negotiable and nonnegotiable documents.

          (j) Indemnification. The Parent hereby agrees to indemnify and hold
     harmless each Lender, the LC Issuer, the Acceptance Lender, and the Agent,
     and their respective directors, officers, agents, and employees from and
     against any and all claims and damages, losses, liabilities, costs, or
     expenses which such Lender, the LC Issuer, the Acceptance Lender, or the
     Agent may incur (or which may be claimed against such Lender, the LC
     Issuer, the Acceptance Lender, or the Agent by any Person whatsoever) by
     reason of or in connection with the issuance, execution, and delivery or
     transfer of or payment or failure to pay under any Facility LC or
     Acceptance or any actual or proposed use of any Facility LC or Acceptance,
     including, without limitation, any claims, damages, losses, liabilities,
     costs, or expenses which the LC Issuer or the Acceptance Lender may incur
     by reason of or in connection with (i) the failure of any other Lender to
     fulfill or

CREDIT AGREEMENT  Page 45


<PAGE>

     comply with its obligations to the LC Issuer or the Acceptance Lender
     hereunder (but nothing herein contained shall affect any rights the Parent
     may have against any defaulting Lender) or (ii) by reason of or on account
     of the LC Issuer issuing any Facility LC which specifies that the term
     "Beneficiary" included therein includes any successor by operation of law
     of the named "Beneficiary", but which Facility LC does not require that any
     drawing by any such successor "Beneficiary" be accompanied by a copy of a
     legal document, satisfactory to the LC Issuer, evidencing the appointment
     of such successor "Beneficiary"; provided that the Parent shall not be
     required to indemnify any Lender, the LC Issuer, the Acceptance Lender, or
     the Agent for any claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs, or expenses
     to the extent, but only to the extent, caused by (x) the willful misconduct
     or gross negligence of the LC Issuer or the Acceptance Lender in
     determining whether a request presented under any Facility LC complied with
     the terms of such Facility LC, (y) the LC Issuer's failure to pay or create
     an Acceptance as contemplated under any Facility LC after the presentation
     to it of a request strictly complying with the terms and conditions of such
     Facility LC, or (z) the failure of the Acceptance Lender to pay the amount
     of the Acceptance on maturity to the applicable beneficiary (if not
     previously discounted by the beneficiary to the Acceptance Lender). Nothing
     in this Section 2.4(i) is intended (or shall be deemed or construed) to
     limit the obligations of the Parent under any other provision of this
     Agreement.

          (k) The Lenders' Indemnification of the LC Issuer. Each Lender shall,
     ratably in accordance with its Revolving Pro Rata Share, indemnify the LC
     Issuer, its Affiliates, and their respective directors, officers, agents,
     and employees (to the extent not reimbursed by the Parent) against any
     cost, expense (including reasonable counsel fees and disbursements), claim,
     demand, action, loss, or liability (except such as result from such
     indemnitees' own gross negligence or willful misconduct or the LC Issuer's
     failure to pay under any Facility LC after the presentation to it of a
     request strictly complying with the terms and conditions of the Facility
     LC) that such indemnitees may suffer or incur in connection with this
     Section 2.4 or any action taken or omitted by such indemnitees hereunder.

          (l) The Lender's Indemnification of the Acceptance Lender. Each Lender
     shall, ratably in accordance with its Revolving Pro Rata Share, indemnify
     the Acceptance Lender, its Affiliates, and their respective directors,
     officers, agents, and employees (to the extent not reimbursed by the
     Parent) against any cost, expense (including reasonable counsel fees and
     disbursements), claim, demand, action, loss, or liability (except such as
     result from such indemnitees' own gross negligence or willful misconduct or
     the failure of the Acceptance Lender to pay the amount of the Acceptance on
     maturity to the applicable beneficiary (if not previously discounted by the
     beneficiary to the Acceptance Lender)) that such indemnitees may suffer or
     incur in connection with this Section 2.4 or any action taken or omitted by
     such indemnitees hereunder.

          (m) Rights as a Lender. In its capacity as a Lender, each LC Issuer
     and each Acceptance Lender shall have the same rights and obligations as
     any other Lender.

          (n) Termination. If, notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2.4(a),
     any Facility LC or Acceptance is outstanding upon the termination of this
     Agreement, then

CREDIT AGREEMENT  Page 46


<PAGE>

     upon such termination the Parent shall deposit with the Agent, for the
     benefit of the Agent and the Lenders, with respect to each such Facility LC
     or Acceptance then outstanding, as the Agent in its discretion shall
     specify, either (i) a standby letter of credit (a "Supporting Letter of
     Credit"), in form and substance satisfactory to the Agent, issued by an
     issuer satisfactory to the Agent in an amount equal to 110% of the sum of
     the amount for which each such Facility LC may be drawn and the amount of
     each such Acceptance, plus any fees and expenses associated with such
     Facility LC or Acceptance, under which Supporting Letter of Credit the
     Agent is entitled to draw amounts necessary to reimburse the Agent and the
     Lenders for payments to be made by the Agent and the Lenders under such
     Facility LC or Acceptance and any fees and expenses associated with such
     Facility LC or Acceptance or (ii) cash in an amount equal to 110% of the
     amount necessary to reimburse the Agent and the Lenders for payments to be
     made by the Agent and the Lenders under such Facility LC or Acceptance,
     plus any fees and expenses associated with such Facility LC or Acceptance.
     Such Supporting Letter of Credit or deposit of cash shall be held by the
     Agent, for the benefit of the Agent and the Lenders, as security for, and
     to provide for the payment of, the aggregate undrawn amount of such
     Facility LC or Acceptance remaining outstanding.

          (o) Facility LC/Acceptance Collateral Account. The Parent agrees that
     it will, during the existence of any Default, upon the request of the Agent
     or the Required Lenders, maintain a special collateral account pursuant to
     arrangements satisfactory to the Agent (the "Facility LC/Acceptance
     Collateral Account") at the Agent's office at the address specified
     pursuant to Article 13, in the name of the Parent but under the sole
     dominion and control of the Agent, for the benefit of the Agent and the
     Lenders and in which the Parent shall have no interest other than as set
     forth in Section 8.1. The Parent hereby pledges, assigns, and grants to the
     Agent, for the benefit of the Agent and the Lenders, a security interest in
     all of the Parent's right, title, and interest in and to all funds which
     may from time to time be on deposit in the Facility LC/Acceptance
     Collateral Account to secure the prompt and complete payment and
     performance of all U.S. Obligations. Nothing in this clause (o) shall
     either obligate the Agent to require the Parent to deposit any funds in the
     Facility LC/Acceptance Collateral Account or limit the right of the Agent
     to release any funds held in the Facility LC/Acceptance Collateral Account
     in each case other than as required by Section 8.1.

     Section 2.5 Interest.

          (a) Interest Rates. All outstanding Obligations shall bear interest on
     the unpaid principal amount thereof (including, to the extent permitted by
     law, on accrued interest thereon not paid when due) from the date made or
     incurred until paid in full in cash at a rate determined by reference to
     the Floating Rate or the Eurodollar Rate, as applicable. Except as
     otherwise provided herein, the outstanding Obligations shall bear interest
     as follows:

               (i) for all Floating Rate Loans and other Obligations (other than
          Eurodollar Loans) at a fluctuating per annum rate equal to the lesser
          of (A) the Floating Rate or (B) the Highest Lawful Rate; and

CREDIT AGREEMENT  Page 47


<PAGE>

               (ii) for all Eurodollar Loans at a per annum rate equal to the
          lesser of (A) the Eurodollar Rate or (B) the Highest Lawful Rate.

         Each change in the Prime Rate shall be reflected in the interest rate
         described in clause (i) preceding as of the effective date of such
         change. Subject to Section 2.9, all (y) interest charges on Eurodollar
         Loans and the fees specified in Section 2.10 shall be computed on the
         basis of a year of 360 days and actual days elapsed (which results in
         more interest and fees being paid than if computed on the basis of a
         365 day year) and (z) all other Obligations shall be computed on the
         basis of a 365 (or 366, if applicable) day year. For the purposes of
         the Interest Act (Canada), the yearly rate of interest to which any
         rate calculated on the basis of a period of time different from the
         actual number of days in the year is equivalent to the stated rate
         multiplied by the actual number of days in the year and divided by the
         number of days in the shorter period.

          (b) Rates Applicable After Default. Subject to Section 2.9, during the
     existence of a Default the Agent or the Required Lenders may, at their
     option, by notice to the Borrowers (which notice may be revoked at the
     option of the Required Lenders notwithstanding any provision of Section 8.2
     requiring unanimous consent of the Lenders to changes in interest rates),
     declare that (a) each Eurodollar Loan shall bear interest for the remainder
     of the applicable Interest Period at the rate otherwise applicable to such
     Interest Period, plus 2.00% per annum and (b) each Floating Rate Loan shall
     bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Floating Rate in
     effect from time to time plus 2.00% per annum, provided that during the
     existence of a Default under Section 7.1(f) or Section 7.1(g), the interest
     rates set forth in clause (a) and clause (b) preceding shall be applicable
     to all Obligations without any election or action on the part of the Agent
     or any Lender.

     Section 2.6 Continuation and Conversion of Outstanding Loans.

          (a) Floating Rate Loans (other than NonRatable Loans) shall continue
     as Floating Rate Loans unless and until such Floating Rate Loans are
     converted into Eurodollar Loans pursuant to this Section 2.6 or are repaid
     in accordance with Section 2.11. Each Eurodollar Loan shall continue as a
     Eurodollar Loan until the end of the then applicable Interest Period
     therefor, at which time such Eurodollar Loan shall be automatically
     converted into a Floating Rate Loan unless (a) such Eurodollar Loan is
     repaid in accordance with Section 2.11 or (b) the applicable Borrower
     requests that, at the end of such Interest Period, such Eurodollar Loan
     continue as a Eurodollar Loan for the same or another Interest Period. The
     applicable Borrower may elect from time to time to convert all or any part
     of the Floating Rate Loans owing by such Borrower (other than the
     Non-Ratable Loans) into a Eurodollar Loan. No Borrower may continue any
     Eurodollar Loan as a Eurodollar Loan or convert any Floating Rate Loans
     into a Eurodollar Loan if the Eurodollar Loan resulting from such
     continuation or conversion is less than $1,500,000 or an integral multiple
     of $500,000 in excess thereof. In connection with any proposed continuation
     of a Eurodollar Loan as a Eurodollar Loan or conversion of a Floating Rate
     Loan to a Eurodollar Loan, the applicable Borrower shall deliver to the
     Agent a Borrowing Notice not later than 12:00 noon (Chicago, Illinois time)
     at least three Business Days prior to the date of the requested
     continuation or conversion, specifying:

CREDIT AGREEMENT  Page 48


<PAGE>

               (i) the requested date, which shall be a Business Day, of such
          continuation or conversion;

               (ii) the aggregate amount and Type of the Loan which is to be
          continued or converted; and

               (iii) the amount of such Loan which is to be continued as or
          converted into a Eurodollar Loan and the duration of the Interest
          Period applicable thereto; provided that no Borrower may select an
          Interest Period that ends after the Facility Termination Date or that,
          with respect to any portion of the Term Loans B, extends beyond an
          installment payment date for the Term Loans B unless, after giving
          effect to such election, the portion of the Term Loans B not subject
          to interest periods ending after such installment payment date is
          equal to or greater than the principal due on such installment payment
          date. If any Borrowing Notice delivered pursuant to this Section
          2.6(a) fails to select the duration of the Interest Period for the
          requested Eurodollar Loan, the applicable Borrower shall be deemed to
          have requested such Eurodollar Loan be made with an Interest Period of
          one month in duration.

          (b) Notwithstanding Section 2.6(a), if upon the expiration of any
     Interest Period applicable to Eurodollar Loans any Default or Unmatured
     Default then exists, the applicable Borrower shall be deemed to have
     elected to convert such Eurodollar Loans into Floating Rate Loans effective
     as of the expiration date of such Interest Period.

          (c) The Agent will promptly notify each Lender of its receipt of a
     Borrowing Notice with respect to any continuation or conversion.

          (d) All continuations and conversions shall be made ratably according
     to the respective outstanding principal amounts of the Loans with respect
     to which such notice was given held by each Lender.

     Section 2.7 Borrowing Notices Irrevocable. Any Borrowing Notice (or
telephonic notice in lieu thereof) shall be irrevocable and the applicable
Borrower(s) shall be bound to borrow the funds requested therein in accordance
therewith. With respect to any request by the U.S. Borrowers for a Revolving
Loan which is to be a Floating Rate Advance, in lieu of delivering a Borrowing
Notice, a U.S. Borrower may give the Agent telephonic notice of such request for
advances to the Funding Account not later than the required time specified in
Section 2.1(c)(i). The Agent at all times shall be entitled to rely on such
telephonic notice in making any such Advance, regardless of whether any written
confirmation is received by the Agent.

     Section 2.8 Interest Periods. After giving effect to any Loan, Advance, or
continuation or conversion of any Eurodollar Loan, there may not be more than
eight different Interest Periods in effect hereunder.

     Section 2.9 Limitation of Interest. The Borrowers, the Agent, and the
Lenders intend to strictly comply with all applicable laws, including applicable
usury laws. Accordingly, the provisions of this Section 2.9 shall govern and
control over every other provision of this

CREDIT AGREEMENT  Page 49


<PAGE>

Agreement or any other Loan Document which conflicts or is inconsistent with
this Section 2.9, even if such provision declares that it controls. As used in
this Section 2.9, the term "interest" includes the aggregate of all charges,
fees, benefits, or other compensation which constitute interest under applicable
law, provided that, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, (a) any
non-principal payment shall be characterized as an expense or as compensation
for something other than the use, forbearance, or detention of money and not as
interest and (b) all interest at any time contracted for, reserved, charged, or
received shall be amortized, prorated, allocated, and spread, in equal parts
during the full term of the Obligations. In no event shall the Borrowers or any
other Person be obligated to pay, or any Lender have any right or privilege to
reserve, receive, or retain, (i) any interest in excess of the maximum amount of
nonusurious interest permitted under the laws of the State of California or the
applicable laws (if any) of the U.S. or of any other applicable state or (ii)
total interest in excess of the amount which such Lender could lawfully have
contracted for, reserved, received, retained, or charged had the interest been
calculated for the full term of the Obligations at the Highest Lawful Rate. On
each day, if any, that the interest rate (the "Stated Rate") called for under
this Agreement or any other Loan Document exceeds the Highest Lawful Rate, the
rate at which interest shall accrue shall automatically be fixed by operation of
this sentence at the Highest Lawful Rate for that day, and shall remain fixed at
the Highest Lawful Rate for each day thereafter until the total amount of
interest accrued equals the total amount of interest which would have accrued if
there were no such ceiling rate as is imposed by this sentence. Thereafter,
interest shall accrue at the Stated Rate unless and until the Stated Rate again
exceeds the Highest Lawful Rate when the provisions of the immediately preceding
sentence shall again automatically operate to limit the interest accrual rate.
The daily interest rates to be used in calculating interest at the Highest
Lawful Rate shall be determined by dividing the applicable Highest Lawful Rate
per annum by the number of days in the calendar year for which such calculation
is being made. None of the terms and provisions contained in this Agreement or
in any other Loan Document which directly or indirectly relate to interest shall
ever be construed without reference to this Section 2.9, or be construed to
create a contract to pay for the use, forbearance, or detention of money at an
interest rate in excess of the Highest Lawful Rate. If the term of any
Obligation is shortened by reason of acceleration of maturity as a result of any
Default or by any other cause, or by reason of any required or permitted
prepayment, and if for that (or any other) reason any Lender at any time,
including but not limited to, the stated maturity, is owed or receives (and/or
has received) interest in excess of interest calculated at the Highest Lawful
Rate, then and in any such event all of any such excess interest shall be
canceled automatically as of the date of such acceleration, prepayment, or other
event which produces the excess, and, if such excess interest has been paid to
such Lender, it shall be credited pro tanto against the then outstanding
principal balance of the Borrowers' obligations to such Lender, effective as of
the date or dates when the event occurs which causes it to be excess interest,
until such excess is exhausted or all of such principal has been fully paid and
satisfied, whichever occurs first, and any remaining balance of such excess
shall be promptly refunded to its payor.

     Section 2.10 Fees.


          (a) Unused Commitment Fee. Subject to Section 2.9, until termination
     of the Aggregate Revolving Commitment, the U.S. Borrowers agree to pay to
     the Agent, for the account of the Lenders ratably, in accordance with their
     respective Revolving Pro Rata Shares, on each Payment Date, an unused
     commitment fee (the "Unused Commitment

CREDIT AGREEMENT  Page 50




<PAGE>

     Fee") equal to the Applicable Unused Commitment Fee Rate, multiplied
     by the daily Aggregate Unused Revolving Commitment from the Closing Date
     through and including the Facility Termination Date payable on each Payment
     Date. Subject to Section 2.9, the Unused Commitment Fee shall be computed
     on the basis of a 360 day year for the actual number of days elapsed. For
     purposes of calculating the Unused Commitment Fee pursuant to this Section
     2.10, any payment received by the Agent (if received prior to 12:00 noon
     (Chicago, Illinois time)) shall be deemed to be credited to the Borrowers'
     account on the Business Day following the date such payment is received by
     the Agent.

          (b) LC Fees. The Parent shall pay to the Agent, for the account of the
     Lenders ratably in accordance with their respective Revolving Pro Rata
     Shares, with respect to each Facility LC, a letter of credit fee at a per
     annum rate equal to (i) for standby Facility LCs, the Applicable LC Rate
     for a standby Facility LC in effect from time to time and (ii) for
     commercial Facility LCs, the Applicable LC Rate for a commercial Facility
     LC in effect from time to time, in each case multiplied by the average
     daily undrawn stated amount under such Facility LC (provided that, during
     the existence of a Default, upon notice by the Agent or the Required
     Lenders to the Parent (which notice may be revoked at the option of the
     Required Lenders notwithstanding any provision of Section 8.2 requiring
     unanimous consent of the Lenders to changes in fees), the Applicable LC
     Rate otherwise in effect shall be increased by 2.00% per annum), such fee
     to be payable in arrears on each Payment Date (each such fee paid pursuant
     to this sentence, an "LC Fee"). Subject to Section 2.9, the LC Fee shall be
     computed on the basis of a 360 day year for the actual number of days
     elapsed. The Parent shall also pay to the LC Issuer for its own account (y)
     at the time of issuance of each Facility LC, a fronting fee in an amount
     equal to 0.25% of the stated amount of each Facility LC and (z) documentary
     and processing charges in connection with the issuance or Modification of
     and draws under Facility LCs in accordance with the LC Issuer's standard
     schedule for such charges as in effect from time to time.

          (c) Acceptance Fees. The Parent shall pay to the Agent, for the
     account of the Lenders ratably in accordance with their respective
     Revolving Pro Rata Shares, with respect to each Acceptance, a fee at a per
     annum rate equal to the Applicable Acceptance Rate multiplied by the
     average daily aggregate amount of outstanding Acceptances, provided, that
     during the existence of a Default, upon notice by the Agent or the Required
     Lenders to the Parent (which notice may be revoked at the option of the
     Required Lenders notwithstanding any provision of Section 8.2 requiring
     unanimous consent of the Lenders to changes in fees), the Applicable
     Acceptance Rate otherwise in effect shall be increased by an additional
     2.00% per annum, such fee to be payable in arrears on each Payment Date
     (each such fee, an "Acceptance Fee"). Subject to Section 2.9, each
     Acceptance Fee shall be computed on the basis of a 360 day year for the
     actual number of days elapsed. The Parent shall also pay to the Acceptance
     Lender for its own account documentary and processing charges in connection
     with the creation and payment of the contemplated Acceptance in accordance
     with the Acceptance Lender's standard schedule for such charges as in
     effect from time to time.

          (d) Seasonal Inventory Advance Fee. During the period from December 1
     of each calendar year through and including March 31 of the following
     calendar year, the

CREDIT AGREEMENT  Page 51


<PAGE>

     Borrowers shall pay to the Agent, for the benefit of the Lenders, a
     fee in an amount equal to 0.50% per annum multiplied by the daily average
     amount, if any, by which the aggregate amount of Revolving Loans exceeds
     the Borrowing Base Calculation determined without giving effect to the
     proviso of the definition of Borrowing Base Calculation, such fee to be
     payable in arrears on the first day of each calendar month. Subject to
     Section 2.9, the fee required by this Section 2.10(d) shall be computed on
     the basis of a 360 day year for the actual number of days elapsed.

     Section 2.11 Payment of the Loans.

          (a) Revolving Loans. The Borrowers shall repay the outstanding
     principal balance of the Revolving Loans, together with all other
     Obligations, other than the Term Loans and interest thereon, including all
     accrued and unpaid interest thereon, on the Facility Termination Date as
     follows: K2 Canada shall repay the Canadian Obligations; the U.K. Borrowers
     shall repay the U.K. Obligations; and the U.S. Borrowers shall repay the
     U.S. Obligations. The Borrowers may prepay their respective Revolving Loans
     at any time and reborrow subject to the terms of this Agreement; provided
     that with respect to any Eurodollar Loans prepaid prior to the expiration
     date of the Interest Period applicable thereto, the U.S. Borrowers shall
     pay to the Agent, for the account of the Lenders, the amounts described in
     Section 3.4. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the
     foregoing, upon demand (i) K2 Canada shall pay to the Agent, for account of
     the Lenders, the amount, if any and without duplication, by which the
     outstanding Revolving Loans owing by K2 Canada exceed the Canadian
     Borrowing Base, (ii) the U.K. Borrowers shall pay to the Agent, for account
     of the Lenders, the amount, if any and without duplication, by which the
     outstanding Revolving Loans owing by the U.K. Borrowers exceed the U.K.
     Borrowing Base, and (iii) the U.S. Borrowers shall pay to the Agent, for
     account of the Lenders, the amount, if any and without duplication, by
     which the Aggregate Outstanding Revolving Credit Exposure owing by the U.S.
     Borrowers exceeds the U.S. Borrowing Base. Accrued interest on the
     Revolving Loans shall be due and payable on each Payment Date.

          (b) Term Loans. The U.S. Borrowers shall pay to the Agent, for the
     account of the Lenders, the outstanding principal amount of the Term Loans
     B in consecutive monthly principal installments of $555,555.56 on each
     applicable Payment Date, and in any event, all unpaid Obligations in
     respect of the Term Loans B are due and payable on the Facility Termination
     Date. Accrued interest on the Term Loans B shall be due and payable on each
     Payment Date.

     Section 2.12 Termination of Facilities.

          (a) Without limiting Section 2.11 or Section 8.1, (a) the Aggregate
     Commitment shall expire on the Facility Termination Date and (b) the
     Aggregate Outstanding Credit Exposure and all other unpaid Obligations
     shall be paid in full on the Facility Termination Date.

          (b) The Borrowers may terminate this Agreement upon at least five
     Business Days prior written notice thereof to the Agent and the Lenders,
     upon (a) the payment in

CREDIT AGREEMENT  Page 52

<PAGE>

     full of all outstanding Loans, together with accrued and unpaid
     interest thereon, (b) the cancellation and return of all outstanding
     Facility LCs (or alternatively, with respect to each such Facility LC, the
     furnishing to the Agent of a cash deposit or Supporting Letter of Credit as
     required by Section 2.4(l)), (c) the payment in full of the early
     termination fee set forth in the following sentence, (d) the payment in
     full of all reimbursable expenses and other Obligations together with
     accrued and unpaid interest thereon, and (e) the payment in full of any
     amount due under Section 3.4. Subject to Section 2.9, if this Agreement is
     terminated at any time prior to the Facility Termination Date, whether
     pursuant to this Section 2.12 or pursuant to Section 8.1, the U.S.
     Borrowers shall pay to the Agent, for the account of the Lenders, an early
     termination fee determined in accordance with the following table:

     anniversary of the Closing Date
    ===========================================     =================================
</TABLE>

     As used in the preceding table, notwithstanding any other definition
     or provision of this Agreement to the contrary, "Aggregate Commitment"
     shall mean the sum of the Aggregate Revolving Commitment as of the date of
     termination of this Agreement, plus the highest aggregate amount of the
     Term Loans B outstanding during the 60 day period immediately preceding the
     date of termination of this Agreement. No early termination fee shall be
     payable in connection with any early payment of the Term Loans B if the
     Aggregate Revolving Commitment is not terminated within 90 days of such
     early payment of the Term Loans B. Additionally, no such early termination
     fee shall be payable in the event this Agreement is terminated in
     connection with refinancing of the Obligations in a transaction in which
     Bank One or one of its Affiliates provides or arranges a replacement credit
     facility for the Borrowers or any of them. The Borrowers may, without
     premium or penalty, permanently reduce the Aggregate Revolving Commitment
     ratably among the Lenders to an amount not less than $170,000,000 or any
     integral multiple of $10,000,000 in excess thereof, upon at least five
     Business Days written notice to the Agent, which notice shall specify the
     amount of any such reduction, provided, however, that the amount of the
     Aggregate Revolving Commitment may not be reduced below the Aggregate
     Outstanding Revolving Credit Exposure.

     Section 2.13 Prepayment of the Loans.

          (a) The Borrowers may prepay the principal of the Revolving Loans, in
     whole or in part, at any time and from time to time.

          (b) The U.S. Borrowers (i) may prepay the principal of the Term Loans
     B, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time if, after giving
     effect to any such prepayment, the Unused Availability is greater than (A)
     for any prepayment between April 1 and November 30 of any calendar year,
     $40,000,000 and (B) for any prepayment

CREDIT AGREEMENT  Page 53

<PAGE>

     between December 1 of a calendar year and March 31 of the following
     calendar year, $20,000,000 and (ii) shall prepay the principal of the Term
     Loans B as required by Section 6.14(g).

          (c) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary
     (including, without limitation, Section 2.13(b) and Section 2.16), not
     later than fifteen days after delivery of the Parent's financial statements
     pursuant to Section 6.1(a), the U.S. Borrowers shall make a prepayment of
     the principal of the Term Loans B in an amount equal to 50.0% of the Excess
     Cash Flow for the preceding Fiscal Year of the Parent, to the extent Unused
     Availability is greater than $20,000,000.

          (d) Immediately upon receipt by any Obligated Party of proceeds of any
     sale of any Facility Collateral, the Borrowers shall cause such Obligated
     Party to deliver such proceeds to the Agent, or deposit such proceeds in a
     deposit account subject to a Deposit Account Control Agreement. All of such
     proceeds shall be applied, without premium or penalty, as a payment to the
     Loans as provided in Section 2.16.

          (e) All cash amounts received by any Obligated Party from any other
     Person as a result of or in connection with any dividend, distribution,
     loan, or other advance (other than a loan or advance by an Obligated Party
     to a Borrower and excluding the proceeds of the Revolving Loans) to such
     Obligated Party shall be paid to the Agent, promptly upon such receipt, for
     application to the Revolving Loans in accordance with Section 2.16.

     Section 2.14 Payments by the Borrowers.

          (a) All payments to be made by the Borrowers shall be made without
     setoff, recoupment, or counterclaim. Without in any way limiting any
     provision of any Security Agreement (including, without limitation, Article
     7 of the Parent Security Agreement which is a "Pledge and Security
     Agreement" or Article 7 of the U.S. Subsidiary Security Agreement which is
     a "Pledge and Security Agreement"), except as otherwise expressly provided
     herein, all payments by the Borrowers shall be made to the Agent, for the
     account of the Lenders, to the account designated by the Agent and shall be
     made in U.S. dollars and in immediately available funds, no later than
     12:00 noon (Chicago, Illinois time) on the date specified herein. Any
     payment received by the Agent after such time shall be deemed to have been
     received on the following Business Day and any applicable interest or fee
     shall continue to accrue.

          (b) Subject to the provisions set forth in the definition of Interest
     Period, whenever any payment is due on a day other than a Business Day,
     such payment shall be due on the following Business Day, and such extension
     of time shall in such case be included in the computation of interest or
     fees, as the case may be.

     Section 2.15 Payments as Revolving Advances. At the election of the Agent,
all payments of principal, interest, reimbursement obligations in connection
with Facility LCs and Acceptances, fees, premiums, reimbursable expenses
(including, without limitation, all reimbursement for fees and expenses pursuant
to Section 9.6), and other sums payable under the

CREDIT AGREEMENT  Page 54

<PAGE>

Loan Documents, may be paid from the proceeds of Revolving Advances made
hereunder whether made following a request by the Borrowers pursuant to Section
2.1 or a deemed request as provided in this Section 2.15 or may be deducted from
any Funding Account or any other deposit account of any Borrower maintained with
the Agent. The Borrowers hereby irrevocably authorize the Agent to make an
Advance for the purpose of paying all amounts from time to time due under the
Loan Documents and agree that all such amounts charged shall constitute
Revolving Loans (including Non-Ratable Loans and Collateral Protection Advances)
and that all such Advances shall be deemed to have been requested pursuant to
Section 2.1.

     Section 2.16 Apportionment, Application, and Reversal of Payments.
Principal and interest payments shall be apportioned ratably among the Lenders
(according to the unpaid principal balance of the Loans to which such payments
relate held by each Lender) and payments of the fees shall, as applicable, be
apportioned ratably among the Lenders, except for fees payable solely to the
Agent, the LC Issuer, and the Acceptance Lender, respectively, and except as
provided in Section 10.13. All payments shall be remitted to the Agent and all
such payments not relating to principal or interest of specific Loans, or not
constituting payment of specific fees, and all proceeds of any Facility
Collateral received by the Agent, shall be applied, ratably, subject to the
provisions of this Agreement (including, the first sentence of Section 2.11(a)
and Section 6.32(b)) first, to pay any fees, indemnities, or expense
reimbursements including amounts then due to the Agent from the Borrowers,
second, to pay any fees or expense reimbursements then due to the Lenders from
the Borrowers, third, to pay interest due in respect of the Revolving Loans,
including Non-Ratable Loans and Collateral Protection Advances, fourth, to pay
or prepay principal of the Non-Ratable Loans and the Collateral Protection
Advances, fifth, to pay or prepay principal of the Revolving Loans (other than
Non-Ratable Loans and Collateral Protection Advances), unpaid Reimbursement
Obligations, and unpaid Acceptance Reimbursement Obligations, sixth, during the
existence of any Default, to pay an amount to the Agent equal to 110% of the
aggregate undrawn face amount of all outstanding Facility LCs and Acceptances,
to be held as cash collateral in the Facility LC/Acceptance Collateral Account
for such Obligations, seventh, to the payment of the Term Loans B as specified
in the following sentence, eighth, to payment of any amounts owing with respect
to Banking Services, and ninth, to the payment of any other Obligation due to
the Agent or any Lender by the Borrowers; provided that any payment received
from or proceeds of Facility Collateral of (a) any Canadian Obligated Party
shall be applied only to the Canadian Obligations and (b) any U.K. Obligated
Party shall be applied only to the U.K. Obligations. With respect to any
payments due on the Term Loans B, such payments shall be applied ratably,
subject to the provisions of this Agreement, first, to pay interest due in
respect of the Term Loans B and second, to pay or prepay principal of the Term
Loans B, with any prepayment amount being applied to scheduled installments of
the Term Loans B in the inverse order of maturity. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Agreement, unless so directed by a Borrower, or
unless a Default is in existence, neither the Agent nor any Lender shall apply
any payment which it receives to any Eurodollar Loan, except (y) on the
expiration date of the Interest Period applicable to any such Eurodollar Loan or
(z) in the event, and only to the extent, that there are no outstanding Floating
Rate Loans and, in any event, the Borrowers shall pay the Eurodollar breakage
losses in accordance with Section 3.4. Subject to the first sentence of Section
2.11(a), the Agent and the Lenders shall have the continuing and exclusive right
to apply and reverse and reapply any and all such proceeds and payments to any
portion of the Obligations.

     Section 2.17 Settlement. Each Lender's funded portion of the Revolving
Loans is intended by the Lenders to be equal at all times to such Lender's
Revolving Pro Rata Share of the outstanding Revolving Loans. Notwithstanding
such agreement, the Agent, Bank One (with respect to the Non-Ratable Loans), and
the Lenders agree (which agreement shall not be for the benefit of or
enforceable by the Obligated Parties) that in order to facilitate the
administration of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, settlement among
them as to the Revolving Loans, including the Non-Ratable Loans and the
Collateral Protection Advances shall take place on a periodic basis in
accordance with the following provisions:

          (a) The Agent shall request settlement (a "Settlement") with the
     Lenders on at least a weekly basis, or on a more frequent basis at the
     Agent's election, (A) on behalf of Bank One, with respect to each
     outstanding Non-Ratable Loan, (B) for itself, with respect to each
     Collateral Protection Advance, and (C) with respect to collections
     received, in each case, by notifying the Lenders of such requested
     Settlement by telecopy, telephone, or email, of such requested Settlement,
     no later than 12:00 noon (Chicago, Illinois time) on the date of such
     requested Settlement (the "Settlement Date"). Each Lender (other than Bank
     One, in the case of the Non-Ratable Loans, and the Agent, in the case of
     the Collateral Protection Advances) shall transfer the amount of such
     Lender's Revolving Pro Rata Share of the outstanding principal amount of
     the Non-Ratable Loans and the Collateral Protection Advances with respect
     to which Settlement is requested to the Agent, to such account of the Agent
     as the Agent may designate, not later than 2:00 p.m. (Chicago, Illinois
     time), on the Settlement Date applicable thereto. Settlements may occur
     during the existence of a Default or an Unmatured Default and whether or
     not the applicable conditions precedent set forth in Article 4 have then
     been satisfied. Such amounts transferred to the Agent shall be applied
     against the amounts of the applicable Non-Ratable Loan or Collateral
     Protection Advance and, together with the portion of such Non-Ratable Loan
     or Collateral Protection Advance representing Bank One's Revolving Pro Rata
     Share thereof, shall constitute Revolving Loans of such Lenders,
     respectively. If any such amount is not transferred to the Agent by any
     Lender on the Settlement Date applicable thereto, the Agent shall be
     entitled to recover such amount on demand from such Lender together with
     interest thereon at the Federal Funds Rate for the first three days from
     and after the Settlement Date and thereafter at the Interest Rate then
     applicable to the Floating Rate Revolving Loans (Y) on behalf of Bank One,
     with respect to each outstanding Non-Ratable Loan and (Z) for itself, with
     respect to each Collateral Protection Advance.

          (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, not more than one Business Day
     after demand is made by the Agent (whether before or after the occurrence
     of a Default or an Unmatured Default and regardless of whether the Agent
     has requested a Settlement with respect to a Non-Ratable Loan or Collateral
     Protection Advance), each other Lender (A) shall irrevocably and
     unconditionally purchase and receive from Bank One or the Agent, as
     applicable, without recourse or warranty, an undivided interest and
     participation in such Non-Ratable Loan or Collateral Protection Advance
     equal to such Lender's Revolving Pro Rata Share of such Non-Ratable Loan or
     Collateral Protection Advance, and (B) if Settlement has not previously
     occurred with respect to such Non-Ratable Loans or Collateral Protection
     Advances, upon demand by the Agent or Bank One, as applicable, shall pay to
     the Agent or Bank One, as applicable, as the purchase

CREDIT AGREEMENT  Page 56

<PAGE>

     price of such participation an amount equal to 100% of such Lender's
     Revolving Pro Rata Share of such Non-Ratable Loans or Collateral Protection
     Advances. If such amount is not in fact transferred to the Agent by any
     Lender, the Agent shall be entitled to recover such amount on demand from
     such Lender together with interest thereon at the Federal Funds Rate for
     the first three days from and after such demand and thereafter at the
     interest rate then applicable to Floating Rate Revolving Loans.

          (c) From and after the date, if any, on which any Lender purchases an
     undivided interest and participation in any Non-Ratable Loan or Collateral
     Protection Advance pursuant to clause (b) preceding, the Agent shall
     promptly distribute to such Lender, such Lender's Revolving Pro Rata Share
     of all payments of principal and interest and all proceeds of Collateral
     received by the Agent in respect of such Non-Ratable Loan or Collateral
     Protection Advance.

          (d) Between Settlement Dates, to the extent no Agent Advances are
     outstanding, the Agent may pay over to Bank One any payments received by
     the Agent, which in accordance with the terms of this Agreement would be
     applied to the reduction of the Revolving Loans, for application to Bank
     One's Revolving Loans including Non-Ratable Loans. If, as of any Settlement
     Date, collections received since the then immediately preceding Settlement
     Date have been applied to Bank One's Revolving Loans (other than to
     Non-Ratable Loans or Collateral Protection Advances in which a Lender has
     not yet funded its purchase of a participation pursuant to clause (b)
     preceding), as provided for in the previous sentence, Bank One shall pay to
     the Agent for the accounts of the Lenders, to be applied to the outstanding
     Revolving Loans of such Lenders, an amount such that each Lender shall,
     upon receipt of such amount, have, as of such Settlement Date, its
     Revolving Pro Rata Share of the Revolving Loans. During the period between
     Settlement Dates, Bank One with respect to Non-Ratable Loans, the Agent
     with respect to Collateral Protection Advances, and each Lender with
     respect to the Revolving Loans other than Non-Ratable Loans and Collateral
     Protection Advances, shall be entitled to interest at the applicable rate
     or rates payable under this Agreement on the actual average daily amount of
     funds employed by Bank One, the Agent, and the other Lenders.

     Section 2.18 Indemnity for Returned Payments. If after receipt of any
payment which is applied to the payment of all or any part of the Obligations,
the Agent or any Lender is for any reason compelled to surrender such payment or
proceeds to any Person because such payment or application of proceeds is
invalidated, declared fraudulent, set aside, determined to be void or voidable
as a preference, impermissible setoff, or a diversion of trust funds, or for any
other reason, then the Obligations or part thereof intended to be satisfied
shall be revived and continued and this Agreement shall continue in full force
as if such payment or proceeds had not been received by the Agent or such Lender
and the Borrowers shall be liable to pay to the Agent and the Lenders, and each
Borrower hereby indemnifies the Agent and the Lenders and holds the Agent and
the Lenders harmless for the amount of such payment or proceeds surrendered. The
provisions of this Section 2.18 shall be and remain effective notwithstanding
any contrary action which may have been taken by the Agent or any Lender in
reliance upon such payment or application of proceeds, and any such contrary
action so taken shall be without prejudice to the Agent's and the Lenders'
rights under this Agreement and shall be deemed to have been

CREDIT AGREEMENT  Page 57

<PAGE>

conditioned upon such payment or application of proceeds having become final and
irrevocable. The provisions of this Section 2.18 shall survive the termination
of this Agreement.

     Section 2.19 Judgment Currency. If for the purposes of obtaining judgment
in any court it is necessary to convert a sum due from any Borrower hereunder in
U.S. dollars into another currency, the parties hereto agree, to the fullest
extent that they may effectively do so, that the rate of exchange used shall be
that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the Agent could
purchase U.S. dollars with such other currency at the Agent's office in Chicago,
Illinois on the Business Day preceding that on which final, non-appealable
judgment is given. The obligations of the Borrowers in respect of any sum due to
any Lender or the Agent hereunder shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a
currency other than U.S. dollars, be discharged only to the extent that on the
Business Day following receipt by such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be)
of any sum adjudged to be so due in such other currency such Lender or the Agent
(as the case may be) may in accordance with normal, reasonable banking
procedures purchase U.S. dollars with such other currency. If the amount of U.S.
dollars so purchased is less than the sum originally due to such Lender or the
Agent, as the case may be, in the specified currency, the Borrower agrees, to
the fullest extent that it may effectively do so, as a separate obligation and
notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify such Lender or the Agent, as the
case may be, against such loss, and if the amount of the specified currency so
purchased exceeds (a) the sum originally due to any Lender or the Agent, as the
case may be, in the specified currency and (b) any amounts shared with other
Lenders as a result of allocations of such excess as a disproportionate payment
to such Lender under Section 12.2, such Lender or the Agent, as the case may be,
agrees to remit such excess to the applicable Borrower.

                             YIELD PROTECTION; TAXES

     Section 3.1 Yield Protection. If, on or after the Closing Date, the
adoption of any law or any governmental or quasi-governmental rule, regulation,
policy, guideline, or directive (whether or not having the force of law), or any
change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental or
quasi-governmental authority, central bank, or comparable agency charged with
the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any Lender,
applicable Lending Installation, LC Issuer, or Acceptance Lender with any
request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) of any such
authority, central bank, or comparable agency:

          (a) subjects any Lender, applicable Lending Installation, LC Issuer,
     or Acceptance Lender to any Taxes, or changes the basis of taxation of
     payments (other than with respect to Excluded Taxes) to any Lender, LC
     Issuer or Acceptance Lender in respect of its Eurodollar Loans, Facility
     LCs, Acceptances, or participations therein;

          (b) imposes or increases or deems applicable any reserve, assessment,
     insurance charge, special deposit, or similar requirement against assets
     of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender,
     applicable Lending Installation, LC Issuer, or Acceptance Lender (other
     than reserves and assessments taken into account in determining the
     interest rate applicable to Eurodollar Advances); or

CREDIT AGREEMENT  Page 58

<PAGE>

          (c) imposes any other condition the result of which is to increase the
     cost to any Lender, applicable Lending Installation, LC Issuer, or
     Acceptance Lender of making, funding, or maintaining its Eurodollar Loans,
     or of issuing or participating in Facility LCs or Acceptances, or reduces
     any amount receivable by any Lender, applicable Lending Installation, LC
     Issuer, or Acceptance Lender in connection with its Eurodollar Loans,
     Facility LCs, Acceptances, or participations in Facility LCs or
     Acceptances, or requires any Lender, applicable Lending Installation, LC
     Issuer, or Acceptance Lender to make any payment calculated by reference to
     the amount of Eurodollar Loans, Facility LCs, Acceptances, or
     participations in Facility LCs or Acceptances held or interest or LC Fees
     or Acceptance Fees received by it, by an amount deemed material by such
     Lender, LC Issuer, or Acceptance Lender, as the case may be;

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender,
applicable Lending Installation, LC Issuer, or Acceptance Lender, as the case
may be, of making or maintaining its Eurodollar Loans or Revolving Commitment,
of issuing or participating in Facility LCs, or of accepting or participating in
Acceptances or to reduce the return received by such Lender, applicable Lending
Installation, LC Issuer, or Acceptance Lender, as the case may be, in connection
with such Eurodollar Loans, Revolving Commitment, Facility LCs, Acceptances, or
participations in Facility LCs or Acceptances, then, within fifteen days of
demand by such Lender, LC Issuer, or Acceptance Lender (any such demand to be
made within 180 days of the date such Lender, LC Issuer, or Acceptance Lender
obtains knowledge that it is entitled to compensation pursuant to this Section
3.1), as the case may be, the applicable Borrower or Borrowers shall pay such
Lender, LC Issuer, or Acceptance Lender, as the case may be, such additional
amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender, LC Issuer, or Acceptance
Lender, as the case may be, for such increased cost or reduction in amount
received.

     Section 3.2 Changes in Capital Adequacy Regulations. If any Lender, LC
Issuer, or Acceptance Lender determines the amount of capital required or
expected to be maintained by such Lender, LC Issuer, Acceptance Lender, or any
Lending Installation of such Lender, LC Issuer, or Acceptance Lender, or any
corporation controlling such Lender, LC Issuer, or Acceptance Lender is
increased as a result of a Change (as defined below), then, within fifteen days
of demand by such Lender, LC Issuer, or Acceptance Lender, the Borrowers shall
pay such Lender, LC Issuer, or Acceptance Lender the amount necessary to
compensate for any shortfall in the rate of return on the portion of such
increased capital which such Lender, LC Issuer, or Acceptance Lender reasonably
determines is attributable to this Agreement, its Outstanding Credit Exposure,
or its commitment to make Loans, issue or participate in Facility LCs, and
accept or participate in Acceptances, as the case may be, hereunder (after
taking into account such Lender's, LC Issuer's, or Acceptance Lender's policies
as to capital adequacy). As used in this Section, "Change" means (a) any change
after the Closing Date in the Risk-Based Capital Guidelines (as defined below)
or (b) any adoption of or change after the Closing Date 0in any other law,
governmental or quasi-governmental rule, regulation, policy, guideline,
interpretation, or directive (whether or not having the force of law) which
affects the amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by any
Lender, LC Issuer, Acceptance Lender, Lending Installation of any Lender, LC
Issuer, or Acceptance Lender, or any corporation controlling any Lender, LC
Issuer, or Acceptance Lender. As used in this Section, "Risk-Based Capital
Guidelines" means (y) the risk-based capital guidelines in effect in the U.S. on
the Closing Date, including transition rules, and (z) the corresponding capital
regulations promulgated by regulatory authorities outside

the U.S. implementing the July 1988 report of the Basle Committee on Banking
Regulation and Supervisory Practices Entitled "International Convergence of
Capital Measurements and Capital Standards," including transition rules, and any
amendments to such regulations adopted prior to the Closing Date.

     Section 3.3 Availability of Types of Advances. If any Lender determines
that maintenance of its Eurodollar Loans at a suitable Lending Installation
would violate any applicable law, rule, regulation, or directive, whether or not
having the force of law, or if the Required Lenders determine that (a) deposits
of a type and maturity appropriate to match fund Eurodollar Loans are not
available or (b) the interest rate applicable to Eurodollar Loans does not
accurately reflect the cost of making or maintaining Eurodollar Loans, then the
Agent shall suspend the availability of Eurodollar Loans and require any
affected Eurodollar Loans to be repaid or converted to Floating Rate Loans,
subject to the payment of any funding indemnification amounts required by
Section 3.4.

     Section 3.4 Funding Indemnification. If any payment of a Eurodollar Loan
occurs on a date which is not the last day of the applicable Interest Period,
whether because of acceleration, prepayment, or otherwise, or a Eurodollar Loan
is not made on the date specified by the U.S. Borrowers for any reason other
than default by the Lenders, the applicable Borrower will indemnify each Lender
for any loss or cost incurred by it resulting therefrom, including, without
limitation, any loss or cost in liquidating or employing deposits acquired to
fund or maintain such Eurodollar Loan, but in any event excluding loss of
anticipated profit.

     Section 3.5 Taxes.

          (a) All payments by any Borrower to or for the account of any Lender,
     any LC Issuer, any Acceptance Lender, or the Agent hereunder or under any
     Note, Facility LC Application, or request for Acceptance shall be made free
     and clear of and without deduction for any and all Taxes. If any Borrower
     shall be required by law to deduct any Taxes, or the Agent or any Lender
     shall be obligated to remit any Taxes, in either case from or in respect of
     any sum payable hereunder to any Lender, any LC Issuer, any Acceptance
     Lender or the Agent, (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so
     that after making all required deductions or remittances (including
     deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 3.5)
     such Lender, such LC Issuer, such Acceptance Lender or the Agent (as the
     case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had
     no such deductions been made, (ii) the applicable Borrower shall make such
     deductions, (iii) the applicable Borrower shall pay the full amount
     deducted to the relevant authority in accordance with applicable law, and
     (iv) the applicable Borrower shall furnish to the Agent the original copy
     of a receipt evidencing payment thereof within 30 days after such payment
     is made.

          (b) In addition, each Borrower hereby agrees to pay any present or
     future stamp or documentary taxes and any other excise or property taxes,
     charges, or similar levies which arise from any payment made hereunder or
     under any Note or Facility LC Application or from the execution or delivery
     of, or otherwise with respect to, this Agreement, any Note, or any Facility
     LC Application ("Other Taxes").

CREDIT AGREEMENT  Page 60

<PAGE>

          (c) Each Borrower hereby agrees to indemnify the Agent, each LC
     Issuer, each Acceptance Lender, and each Lender for the full amount of
     Taxes or Other Taxes (including, without limitation, any Taxes or Other
     Taxes imposed on amounts payable under this Section 3.5) paid by, or
     assessable against, the Agent, such LC Issuer, such Acceptance Lender, or
     such Lender (including any amounts required to be remitted by any of such
     Persons) as a result of its commitment to make Loans hereunder, any Loans
     made by it hereunder, or otherwise in connection with its participation in
     this Agreement and any liability (including penalties, interest, and
     expenses, including any failure by the Agent or any Lender to make any
     remittance) arising therefrom or with respect thereto. Payments due under
     this indemnification shall be made within 30 days of the date the Agent,
     such LC Issuer, such Acceptance Lender, or such Lender makes demand
     therefor pursuant to Section 3.6.

          (d) Each Lender that is not incorporated under the laws of the U.S. or
     a state thereof (each a "Non-U.S. Lender") agrees that it will, not more
     than ten Business Days after the Closing Date (or the date of assignment by
     which such Lender becomes a party to this Agreement), (i) deliver to the
     Agent two duly completed copies of U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form W8BEN
     or W8ECI, certifying in either case that such Lender is entitled to receive
     payments under this Agreement without deduction or withholding of any U.S.
     federal income taxes, and (ii) deliver to the Agent a U.S. Internal Revenue
     Form W8 or W9, as the case may be, and certify that it is entitled to an
     exemption from U.S. backup withholding tax. Each Non-U.S. Lender further
     undertakes to deliver to each of the Borrowers and the Agent (y) renewals
     or additional copies of any such form (or any successor form) on or before
     the date that such form expires or becomes obsolete and (z) after the
     occurrence of any event requiring a change in the most recent forms so
     delivered by it, such additional forms or amendments thereto as may be
     reasonably requested by the Borrowers or the Agent. All forms or amendments
     described in the preceding sentence shall certify that such Lender is
     entitled to receive payments under this Agreement without deduction or
     withholding of any U.S. federal income taxes, unless an event (including,
     without limitation, any change in treaty, law, or regulation) has occurred
     prior to the date on which any such delivery would otherwise be required
     which renders all such forms inapplicable or which would prevent such
     Lender from duly completing and delivering any such form or amendment with
     respect to it and such Lender advises the Borrowers and the Agent that it
     is not capable of receiving payments without any deduction or withholding
     of U.S. federal income tax.

          (e) For any period during which a Non-U.S. Lender has failed to
     provide the Borrowers with an appropriate form pursuant to clause (d)
     preceding (unless such failure is due to a change in treaty, law, or
     regulation, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof
     by any governmental authority, occurring subsequent to the date on which a
     form originally was required to be provided), such Non-U.S. Lender shall
     not be entitled to indemnification under this Section 3.5 with respect to
     Taxes imposed by the U.S.; provided that, should a Non-U.S. Lender which is
     otherwise exempt from or subject to a reduced rate of withholding tax
     become subject to Taxes because of its failure to deliver a form required
     under clause (d) preceding, the Borrowers shall take such steps as such
     Non-U.S. Lender shall reasonably request to assist such Non-U.S. Lender to
     recover such Taxes.

CREDIT AGREEMENT  Page 61

          (f) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of
     withholding tax with respect to payments under this Agreement or any Note
     pursuant to the law of any relevant jurisdiction or any treaty shall
     deliver to the Borrowers (with a copy to the Agent), at the time or times
     prescribed by applicable law, such properly completed and executed
     documentation prescribed by applicable law as will permit such payments to
     be made without withholding or at a reduced rate. Each Lender agrees to
     promptly notify the Agent of any change in circumstances which would modify
     or render invalid any claimed exemption or reduction.

          (g) If the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or any other governmental
     authority of the U.S. or any other country or any political subdivision
     thereof asserts a claim that the Agent did not properly withhold tax from
     amounts paid to or for the account of any Lender (because the appropriate
     form was not delivered or properly completed, because such Lender failed to
     notify the Agent of a change in circumstances which rendered its exemption
     from withholding ineffective, or for any other reason), such Lender shall
     indemnify the Agent fully for all amounts paid, directly or indirectly, by
     the Agent as tax, withholding therefor, or otherwise, including penalties
     and interest, and including taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on amounts
     payable to the Agent under this Section 3.5(g), together with all costs and
     expenses related thereto (including attorneys fees and time charges of
     attorneys for the Agent, which attorneys may be employees of the Agent).
     The obligations of the Lenders under this Section 3.5(g) shall survive the
     payment of the Obligations and termination of this Agreement.

     Section 3.6 Lender Statements; Survival of Indemnity. To the extent
reasonably possible, each Lender shall designate an alternate Lending
Installation with respect to its Eurodollar Loans to reduce any liability of the
Borrowers to such Lender under Section 3.1, Section 3.2, and Section 3.5 or to
avoid the unavailability of Eurodollar Loans under Section 3.3, so long as such
designation is not, in the judgment of such Lender, disadvantageous to such
Lender. Each Lender shall deliver a written statement of such Lender to the
Borrowers (with a copy to the Agent) as to the amount due, if any, under Section
3.1, Section 3.2, Section 3.4, or Section 3.5. Such written statement shall set
forth in reasonable detail the calculations upon which such Lender determined
such amount and shall be final, conclusive, and binding on the Borrowers in the
absence of manifest error. Determination of amounts payable under such Sections
in connection with a Eurodollar Loan shall be calculated as though each Lender
funded its Eurodollar Loan through the purchase of a deposit of the type and
maturity corresponding to the deposit used as a reference in determining the
Eurodollar Rate applicable to such Loan, whether in fact that is the case or
not. Unless otherwise provided herein, the amount specified in the written
statement of any Lender shall be payable on demand after receipt by the
Borrowers of such written statement. The obligations of the Borrowers under
Section 3.1, Section 3.2, Section 3.4, and Section 3.5 shall survive payment of
the Obligations and termination of this Agreement.

     Section 3.7 Replacement of a Lender. If the Borrowers are required pursuant
to Section 3.1, Section 3.2, or Section 3.5 to make any additional payment to
any Lender or if any Lender's obligation to make or continue, or to convert
Floating Rate Advances into, Eurodollar Advances shall be suspended pursuant to
Section 3.3 (any Lender so affected an "Affected Lender"), the Borrowers may
elect, if such amounts continue to be charged or such suspension is

CREDIT AGREEMENT  Page 62

<PAGE>

still effective, to replace such Affected Lender as a Lender party to this
Agreement, provided that no Default or Unmatured Default shall have occurred and
be continuing at the time of such replacement, and provided further that,
concurrently with such replacement, (a) another bank or other entity which is
reasonably satisfactory to the Borrowers and the Agent shall agree, as of such
date, to purchase for cash the Advances and other Obligations due to the
Affected Lender pursuant to an Assignment Agreement and to become a Lender for
all purposes under this Agreement and to assume all obligations of the Affected
Lender to be terminated as of such date and to comply with the requirements of
Section 12.3 applicable to assignments and (b) the Borrowers shall pay to such
Affected Lender in same day funds on the day of such replacement (i) all
interest, fees, and other amounts then accrued but unpaid to such Affected
Lender by the Borrowers hereunder to and including the date of termination,
including, without limitation, payments due to such Affected Lender under
Section 3.1, Section 3.2, and Section 3.5 and (ii) an amount, if any, equal to
the payment which would have been due to such Lender on the day of such
replacement under Section 3.4 had the Loans of such Affected Lender been prepaid
on such date rather than sold to the replacement Lender.

         The Borrowers represent and warrant to the Agent (including in its

dissolved or ceases to exist or subsist as permitted by Section 6.9, each of the
Obligated Parties is a corporation, partnership, limited liability company, or
other business entity duly and properly incorporated, organized, or formed, as
the case may be, validly existing, and (to the extent applicable) in good
standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation, organization, or
formation and has all requisite authority to conduct its business in each
jurisdiction in which its business is conducted.

number has been issued.

     Section 5.3 Authorization and Validity. Each Obligated Party has the power
and authority and legal right to execute and deliver the Loan Documents to which
it is a party and to perform its obligations thereunder. The execution and
delivery by each Obligated Party of the Loan Documents to which it is a party
and the performance of its obligations thereunder have been duly authorized by
proper proceedings, and the Loan Documents to which such Obligated Party is a
party constitute legal, valid, and binding obligations of such Obligated Party
enforceable against such Obligated Party in accordance with their terms, except
as enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, or similar laws
affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally.

     Section 5.4 Name; Prior Transactions. Except as set forth on Schedule 5.4,

     Section 5.5 No Conflict; Government Consent. Neither the execution and
delivery by any Obligated Party of the Loan Documents to which it is a party,
nor the consummation of the transactions therein contemplated, nor compliance

CREDIT AGREEMENT  Page 67

<PAGE>

Obligated Party, (b) such Obligated Party's Organization Certificate or
Management Agreement, as the case may be, or (c) the provisions of any
indenture, instrument, or agreement to which such Obligated Party is a party or
is subject, or by which it, or its Property, is bound, or conflict with or
constitute a default thereunder, or result in, or require, the creation or
imposition of any Lien in, of or on the Property of such Obligated Party
pursuant to the terms of any such indenture, instrument, or agreement. No order,
consent, adjudication, approval, license, authorization, or validation of, or
filing, recording, or registration with, or exemption by, or other action in
respect of any governmental or public body or authority, or any subdivision
thereof, which has not been obtained by the applicable Obligated Party, is
required to be obtained by any Obligated Party in connection with the execution
and delivery of the Loan Documents, the borrowings under this Agreement, the
payment and performance by the Borrowers of the Obligations or the legality,
validity, binding effect, or enforceability of any of the Loan Documents.

     Section 5.6 Security Interest in Facility Collateral. The provisions of
this Agreement and the other Loan Documents create legal and valid Liens on all
the Facility Collateral in favor of the Agent or the U.K. Security Trustee (as
applicable), for the benefit of the Agent and the Lenders, and upon filing of
appropriate UCC financing statements and the recordation of the Real Estate
Mortgages such Liens constitute perfected and continuing Liens on the Facility
Collateral, to the extent such Liens can be perfected by filing of financing
statements or the recordation of such Real Estate Mortgages, securing the
Obligations, enforceable against the applicable Obligated Party and all third
parties, and having priority over all other Liens on the Facility Collateral
except in the case of (a) Permitted Liens, to the extent any such Permitted
Liens would have priority over the Liens in favor of the Agent or the U.K.
Security Trustee (as applicable) pursuant to any applicable law or agreement and
(b) Liens perfected only by control or possession (including possession of any
certificate of title) to the extent the Agent or the U.K. Security Trustee (as
applicable) has not obtained or does not maintain control or possession of such
Collateral.

     Section 5.7 Financial Statements.

          (a) The consolidated financial statements of the Parent and its
     Subsidiaries for the Fiscal Years ended December 31, 2000 and December 31,
     2001 heretofore delivered by the Borrowers to the Lenders were prepared in
     accordance with GAAP (as in effect on the date such statements were
     prepared) and fairly present in all material respects the consolidated
     financial condition and operations of the Parent and its Subsidiaries at
     such date and the consolidated results of their operations for the period
     then ended. The consolidated financial statements of the Parent and its
     Subsidiaries for the calendar month ended November 30, 2002 heretofore
     delivered by the Borrowers to the Lenders were prepared in accordance with

     adjustments) and fairly present in all material respects the consolidated
     financial condition and operations of the Parent and its Subsidiaries at
     such date and the consolidated results of their operations for the period
     then ended.

          (b) The most recent Projections when delivered to the Agent and the

     represent the Borrowers' good

CREDIT AGREEMENT  Page 68

     faith estimate of the future financial performance of the Borrowers
     for the period set forth therein. Nothing herein shall be construed as a
     representation that the financial results set forth in the Projections will
     be achieved. The Agent and the Lenders acknowledge that the Projections are
     forward looking statements and that the financial results of the Parent and
     its Subsidiaries could differ materially from those set forth in the
     Projections.

     Section 5.8 Material Adverse Change. Since November 30, 2002 there has been
no change in the business, Property, prospects, condition (financial or
otherwise), or results of operations of the Parent and its Subsidiaries which
could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

     provincial, municipal, and other tax returns and reports, if any, which are

     has paid all taxes due pursuant to such returns and reports or pursuant to
     any assessment received by such Obligated Party, except such taxes, if any,
     as are being contested in good faith and as to which adequate reserves have
     been provided in accordance with GAAP and as to which no Lien, other than a
     Permitted Lien, exists;

          (b) the income tax returns of each Obligated Party delivered pursuant

     Party in respect of any taxes or other governmental charges are adequate.

     Section 5.10 Litigation and Contingent Obligations. Except as set forth on
Schedule 5.10, as of the Closing Date, there is no litigation, arbitration,
governmental investigation, proceeding, or inquiry pending or, to the knowledge
of any officer of any Obligated Party, threatened against any Obligated Party
which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect or which
seeks to prevent, enjoin, or delay the making of any Credit Extension. Other
than any liability incident to any litigation, arbitration, or proceeding which
could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, no Obligated
Party has any Contingent Obligations not provided for or disclosed in the
financial statements referred to in Section 5.7(a).

     Section 5.11 ERISA and Foreign Plans.

          (a) As of the Closing Date: (i) there is no "accumulated funding

     the laws and regulations applicable to such Foreign Plan and each Obligated

     Plan and related funding arrangement that is intended to qualify for
     tax-favored status has been reviewed and approved for such status by the
     appropriate governmental authority (or has been submitted for such review
     and approval within the applicable time period), and nothing has occurred
     and no condition exists that is likely to cause the loss or denial of such

     respect in excess of the current value of such Foreign Plan's assets,
     determined in accordance with the assumptions used for funding such Foreign
     Plan pursuant to reasonable accounting standards in accordance with
     applicable law. No Obligated Party has incurred or reasonably expects to

     otherwise funded or satisfied with readily available assets set aside with
     respect to such Foreign Plan.

Party is in default in the performance, observance, or fulfillment of any of the
obligations, covenants, or conditions contained in (a) any agreement to which it
is a party, which default could reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect or (b) any agreement or instrument evidencing or governing

     Guide (or otherwise as may be acceptable to the Agent in its discretion)
     insurance against: (i) loss or damage by fire, theft, burglary, pilferage,

     All such insurance shall be in amounts and under policies acceptable to the
     Agent in its reasonable credit judgment. In the event any Facility
     Collateral is located in any area that has been designated by the Federal
     Emergency Management Agency as a "Special Flood Hazard Area," the
     applicable Obligated Party shall purchase and maintain flood insurance on
     such Facility Collateral (including any personal Property which is located

     Hazard Area"). The amount of all insurance required by this Section shall
     at a minimum comply with applicable law, including the Flood Disaster
     Protection Act of 1973. All premiums on such insurance shall be paid when
     due by the applicable Obligated Party, and copies of the policies delivered
     to the Agent. If any Obligated Party fails to obtain any insurance as
     required by this Section, the Agent at the direction of the Required
     Lenders may obtain such insurance at the Borrowers' expense. No Obligated
     Party will use or permit any Property to be used in violation of applicable
     law or in any manner which might render inapplicable any insurance
     coverage.

          (b) All insurance policies required under Section 6.7(a) (other than
     business interruption insurance) shall name the Agent (for the benefit of
     the Agent and the Lenders) as an additional insured, as applicable, and
     shall contain loss payable clauses or mortgagee clauses, in form and
     substance reasonably satisfactory to the Agent, naming the Agent as loss
     payee and first mortgagee (as applicable) and providing that:

               (i) all proceeds thereunder with respect to any Facility
          Collateral shall be payable to the Agent;

               (ii) no such insurance shall be affected by any act or neglect of
          the insured or owner of the Property described in such policy; and

               (iii) such policy and loss payable clauses may be canceled,
          amended, or terminated only upon at least 30 days prior written notice
          given to the Agent.

     Section 6.8 Application of Proceeds of Insurance. The Obligated Parties
shall promptly notify the Agent and the Lenders of any claim in excess of
$2,000,000 under any insurance policy required pursuant to Section 6.7 or of
receipt of any such proceeds pursuant to any claim. During the existence of a
Default, the Agent is hereby authorized to directly collect all insurance
proceeds in respect of any Facility Collateral. All proceeds of any insurance
required pursuant to Section 6.7 shall be delivered to the Agent and applied to
the Obligations in

Standing. Each Obligated Party will comply in all material respects with all
laws, rules, regulations, orders, writs, judgments, injunctions, decrees, or

effect on the business, Property, condition (financial or otherwise), results of
operations, or prospects of such Obligated Party, the ability of such Obligated
Party to perform its respective obligations under the Loan Documents to which it

any of its duties and obligations under any of the Loan Documents or pay the
Obligations when due.

     Section 6.12 Inspection. Each Obligated Party will permit the Agent
(accompanied by each Lender at its own expense), and its respective
representatives, agents, and independent contractors to inspect any of the
Property, books, and financial records of such Obligated Party, to examine and
make copies of the books of accounts and other financial records of such
Obligated Party, and to discuss the affairs, finances, and accounts of such
Obligated Party with, and to be advised as to the same by, their respective

                        REMEDIES; WAIVERS AND AMENDMENTS

     Section 8.1 Remedies; Acceleration; Facility LC/Acceptance Collateral
Account.

          (a) If any Default occurs hereunder, the Required Lenders (or the
     Agent with the consent of the Required Lenders) may (i) reduce the
     Aggregate Revolving Commitment or the Accounts Advance Rate or the
     Inventory Advance Rate, (ii) terminate or suspend the obligations of the
     Lenders to make Loans hereunder, the obligation of the LC Issuer to issue
     Facility LCs, and the obligation of the Acceptance Lender to accept
     Acceptances, (iii) declare the Obligations to be due and payable, whereupon
     the Obligations shall become immediately due and payable, without
     presentment, demand, protest, or notice of any kind, all of which the
     Borrowers hereby expressly waive, (iv) terminate the Aggregate Revolving
     Commitment, (v) upon notice to the Parent and in addition to the continuing
     right to demand payment of all amounts payable under this Agreement, make
     demand on the Parent to pay, and the Parent will, forthwith upon such
     demand and without any further notice or act, pay to the Agent an amount in
     immediately available funds, which funds shall be held in the Facility
     LC/Acceptance Collateral Account, equal to 110% of the difference of (y)
     the sum of the amount of LC Obligations, plus the amount of Acceptance
     Obligations at such time, less

CREDIT AGREEMENT  Page 93

<PAGE>

     (z) the amount on deposit in the Facility LC/Acceptance Collateral
     Account at such time which is free and clear of all rights and claims of
     third parties and has not been applied against the Obligations (such
     difference, the "Collateral Shortfall Amount"), which funds shall be
     deposited in the Facility LC/Acceptance Collateral Account, and (vi) pursue
     their other rights and remedies under the Loan Documents and applicable
     law.

          (b) Upon the occurrence of any Default described in Section 7.1(f) or
     Section 7.1(g), the Aggregate Commitment shall automatically and
     immediately terminate, the obligations of the Lenders to make Loans
     hereunder, the obligation of the LC Issuer to issue Facility LCs, and the
     obligation of the Acceptance Lender to accept Acceptances shall
     automatically and immediately terminate and the Obligations shall
     immediately become due and payable without any election or action on the
     part of the Agent, the LC Issuer, the Acceptance Lender, or any Lender, and
     the Parent will be and become thereby unconditionally obligated, without
     any further notice, act, or demand, to pay to the Agent the Collateral
     Shortfall Amount.

          (c) During the existence of any Default: (i) the Agent shall have, for
     the benefit of the Agent and the Lenders, in addition to all other rights
     of the Agent and the Lenders, the rights and remedies of a secured party
     under the Loan Documents and the UCC; (ii) the Agent may, at any time, take
     possession of the Facility Collateral and keep it on any Obligated Party's
     premises, at no cost to the Agent or any Lender, or remove any part of it
     to such other place or places as the Agent may desire, or any Obligated
     Party shall, upon the Agent's demand, at such Obligated Party's cost,
     assemble the Facility Collateral and make it available to the Agent at a
     place reasonably convenient to the Agent; and (iii) the Agent may sell and
     deliver any Facility Collateral at public or private sales, for cash, upon
     credit, or otherwise, at such prices and upon such terms as the Agent deems
     advisable, in its sole discretion, and may, if the Agent deems it
     reasonable, postpone or adjourn any sale of the Facility Collateral by an
     announcement at the time and place of sale or of such postponed or
     adjourned sale without giving a new notice of sale. Without in any way
     requiring notice to be given in the following manner, each Obligated Party
     agrees that any notice by the Agent of sale, disposition, or other intended
     action hereunder or in connection herewith, whether required by the UCC or
     otherwise, shall constitute reasonable notice to the Obligated Parties if
     such notice is mailed by registered or certified mail, return receipt
     requested, postage prepaid, or is delivered personally against receipt, at
     least ten days prior to such action to the Obligated Parties' address
     specified pursuant to Section 13.1. If any Facility Collateral is sold on
     terms other than payment in full at the time of sale, no credit shall be
     given against the Obligations until the Agent or the Lenders receive
     payment, and if the buyer defaults in payment, the Agent may resell the
     Facility Collateral without further notice to any Obligated Party. In the
     event the Agent seeks to take possession of all or any portion of the
     Facility Collateral by judicial process, each Obligated Party irrevocably
     waives: (A) the posting of any bond, surety, or security with respect
     thereto which might otherwise be required; (B) any demand for possession
     prior to the commencement of any suit or action to recover the Facility
     Collateral; and (C) any requirement that the Agent retain possession and
     not dispose of any Facility Collateral until after trial or final judgment.
     Each Obligated Party agrees that the Agent has no obligation to preserve
     rights to the Facility Collateral or marshal any Facility Collateral for
     the benefit of any

CREDIT AGREEMENT  Page 94

<PAGE>

     Person. The Agent is hereby granted a license or other right to use,
     without charge, each Obligated Party's labels, patents, copyrights, name,
     trade secrets, trade names, trademarks, and advertising matter, or any
     similar property, in completing production of, advertising, or selling any
     Facility Collateral, and each Obligated Party's rights under all licenses
     and all franchise agreements shall inure to the Agent's benefit for such
     purpose. The proceeds of sale shall be applied first to all expenses of
     sale, including reasonable attorneys fees, and then to the Obligations. The
     Agent will return any excess to the Obligated Parties and the Obligated
     Parties shall remain liable for any deficiency.

          (d) If at any time while any Default is continuing, the Agent
     determines that the Collateral Shortfall Amount at such time is greater
     than zero, the Agent may make demand on the Parent to pay, and the Parent
     will, forthwith upon such demand and without any further notice or act, pay
     to the Agent the Collateral Shortfall Amount, which funds shall be
     deposited in the Facility LC/Acceptance Collateral Account. The Parent
     hereby pledges, assigns, and grants to the Agent, on behalf of and for the
     benefit of the Agent, the Lenders, the LC Issuer, and the Acceptance
     Lender, a security interest in all of the Parent's right, title, and
     interest in and to all funds which may from time to time be on deposit in
     the Facility LC/Acceptance Collateral Account to secure the prompt and
     complete payment and performance of the Obligations. Nothing in this
     Section 8.1(d) shall either obligate the Agent to require the Parent to
     deposit any funds in the Facility LC/Acceptance Collateral Account or limit
     the right of the Agent to release any funds held in the Facility
     LC/Acceptance Collateral Account other than as required by this Section
     8.1.

          (e) The Agent may at any time or from time to time after funds are
     deposited in the Facility LC/Acceptance Collateral Account, apply such
     funds to the payment of the Obligations and any other amounts as shall from
     time to time have become due and payable by the Borrowers to the Agent, the
     Lenders, the LC Issuer, or the Acceptance Lender under the Loan Documents.

          (f) At any time while any Default is continuing, neither the Parent
     nor any Person claiming on behalf of or through the Parent shall have any
     right to withdraw any of the funds held in the Facility LC/Acceptance
     Collateral Account. After all of the Obligations have been indefeasibly
     paid in full and the Aggregate Commitment has been terminated, any funds
     remaining in the Facility LC/Acceptance Collateral Account shall be
     returned by the Agent to the Parent or paid to whomever may be legally
     entitled thereto at such time.

          (g) If a Default occurs and is continuing, each Obligated Party hereby
     waives all rights to notice and hearing prior to the exercise by the Agent
     or the U.K. Security Trustee of their respective rights to repossess the
     Facility Collateral without judicial process or to replevy, attach, or levy
     upon the Facility Collateral without notice or hearing.

          Section 10.16.

     No amendment of any provision of this Agreement relating to the Agent
     shall be effective without the written consent of the Agent. Unless
     requiring consent of all of the Lenders, no amendment of any provision of
     this Agreement relating to the Term Loans B or the Lenders holding any
     portion of the Term Loans B (with respect to such Lenders in such capacity)
     shall be effective without the written consent of Lenders holding at least
     a majority of the Term Loans B. No increase of a Lender's Revolving
     Commitment may be effected without the consent of the affected Lender. No
     reduction of the amount of principal, interest, or fees due to any Lender
     may be effected without the consent of such Lender. No amendment of any
     provision of this Agreement relating to the NonRatable Loans shall be
     effective without the written consent of Bank One. No amendment of any
     provision relating to the LC Issuer shall be effective without the written
     consent of the LC Issuer. No amendment of any provision relating to the
     Acceptance Lender shall be effective without the written consent of the
     Acceptance Lender. The Agent may (i) waive payment of the fee required
     under Section 12.3(a) and (ii) amend the amount of the Revolving
     Commitments specified on the signature pages of each Lender hereto to
     reflect increases in the Revolving Commitment of any Lender pursuant to
     Section 2.1(b) and assignments entered into pursuant to Section 12.3, each

     request that Bank One make Non-Ratable Loans in accordance with Section
     2.1(h) and make Collateral Protection Advances in accordance with Section
     2.1(i).

          (c) If any fees are paid to the Lenders as consideration for
     amendments, waivers, or consents with respect to this Agreement, at the
     Agent's election, such fees may be paid only to those Lenders that agree to
     such amendments, waivers, or consents within the time specified for
     submission thereof.

     Section 8.3 Preservation of Rights. No delay or omission of the Agent, the
U.K. Security Trustee, the Lenders, the LC Issuer, or the Acceptance Lender to
exercise any right under the Loan Documents shall impair such right or be
construed to be a waiver of any Default or an acquiescence therein, and the
making of a Credit Extension notwithstanding the existence of a Default or the
inability of the Borrowers to satisfy the conditions precedent to such Credit
Extension shall not constitute any waiver or acquiescence. Any single or partial
exercise of any such right shall not preclude other or further exercise thereof
or the exercise of any other right, and no waiver, amendment, or other variation
of the terms, conditions, or provisions of the Loan Documents whatsoever shall
be valid unless in writing signed by the Lenders required pursuant to Section
8.2, and then only to the extent in such writing specifically set forth. All
remedies contained in the Loan Documents or by law afforded shall be cumulative
and all shall be available to the Agent, the U.K. Security Trustee, the Lenders,
the LC Issuer, and the Acceptance Lender until the Obligations have been paid in
full.

                               GENERAL PROVISIONS

of the Obligated Parties contained in this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents shall survive execution, delivery, and acceptance of the Loan
Documents and the making of the Credit Extensions herein contemplated.

     Section 9.2 Governmental Regulation. Anything contained in this Agreement
to the contrary notwithstanding, neither the LC Issuer, the Acceptance Lender,
nor any Lender shall be obligated to extend credit to the Borrowers in violation
of any limitation or prohibition provided by any applicable statute or
regulation.

     Section 9.3 Headings. Section headings in the Loan Documents are for
convenience of reference only and shall not govern the interpretation of any of
the provisions of the Loan Documents.

     Section 9.4 Entire Agreement. The Loan Documents embody the entire
agreement and understanding among the Obligated Parties, the Agent, the U.K.

     Section 9.5 Several Obligations; Benefits of this Agreement. The respective
obligations of the Lenders hereunder are several and not joint and no Lender
shall be the partner, coventurer, or agent of any other Lender (except to the
extent to which the Agent is authorized to act as administrative agent for the
Lenders hereunder). The failure of any Lender to perform any of its obligations
hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender from any of its obligations
hereunder. This Agreement shall not be construed so as to confer any right or
benefit upon any Person other than the parties to this Agreement and their
respective successors and assigns, provided, however, that the parties hereto
expressly agree that the Arranger shall enjoy the benefits of the provisions of
Section 9.6, Section 9.10, and Section 10.11 to the extent specifically set

     the Arranger in connection with the preparation, negotiation, execution,
     delivery, syndication, distribution (including, without limitation, via the
     internet), review, amendment, modification, and administration of the Loan
     Documents. The Borrowers also agree to reimburse the Agent, the Arranger,
     the LC

     Issuer, and the Acceptance Lender for any costs, internal charges, and
     out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and time

     reimbursed by the Borrowers pursuant to this Section include, without
     limitation, (i) the cost and expense of obtaining appraisals of receivables

     continue the Liens in favor of the Agent created under the Loan Documents
     (including costs and expenses paid or incurred by the Agent in connection
     with the consummation of this Agreement), (v) sums paid or incurred by the
     Agent to pay any amount or take any action required of any Obligated Party
     under the Loan Documents that such Obligated Party fails to pay or take;
     (vi) costs of inspections and verifications of the Facility Collateral,
     including travel, lodging, and meals for field examinations and inspections
     of the Facility Collateral and the Obligated Parties' operations by the
     Agent, plus the Agent's then customary charge for field examinations and
     audits and the preparation of reports thereof (such charge is currently
     $750 per day (or portion thereof) for each Person retained or employed by
     the Agent with respect to each field examination or audit) to the extent
     incurred (A) during the existence of any Default or Unmatured Default or
     (b) at any other time up to three times during any calendar year, and (vii)
     costs and expenses of forwarding loan proceeds, collecting checks and other
     items of payment, and establishing and maintaining deposit accounts and
     lockboxes required under the Loan Documents, and costs and expenses of
     preserving and protecting the Facility Collateral.

          (b) The Borrowers hereby further agree to indemnify the Agent, the
     Arranger, the LC Issuer, the Acceptance Lender, each Lender, their
     respective Affiliates, and each of their directors, officers, agents, and
     employees against all losses, claims, damages, penalties, judgments,
     liabilities, and expenses (including, without limitation, all expenses of
     litigation or preparation therefor whether or not the Agent, the Arranger,
     the LC Issuer, the Acceptance Lender, any Lender or any Affiliate is a
     party thereto) which any of them may pay or incur arising out of or
     relating to this Agreement, the other Loan Documents, the transactions
     contemplated hereby, or the direct or indirect application or proposed
     application of the proceeds of any Credit Extension hereunder except to the
     extent that they are determined in a final non-appealable judgment by a
     court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the gross negligence
     or willful misconduct of the party seeking indemnification.

The obligations of the Borrowers under this Section 9.6 shall survive the
termination of this Agreement.

     Section 9.7 Numbers of Documents. All statements, notices, closing
documents, and requests hereunder required to be provided to the Agent shall be

accounting terms used herein shall be interpreted and all accounting
determinations hereunder shall be made in accordance with GAAP, except that any

     Section 9.9 Severability of Provisions. Any provision in any Loan Document
that is held to be inoperative, unenforceable, or invalid in any jurisdiction
shall, as to that jurisdiction, be inoperative, unenforceable, or invalid
without affecting the remaining provisions in that jurisdiction or the
operation, enforceability, or validity of that provision in any other
jurisdiction, and to this end the provisions of all Loan Documents are declared
to be severable.

     Section 9.10 Nonliability of the Lenders. The relationship between each
Obligated Party on the one hand and the Lenders, the LC Issuer, the Acceptance
Lender, the Arranger, the Agent, and the U.K. Security Trustee on the other hand
shall be solely that of debtor and creditor. Neither the Agent, the Arranger,
the U.K. Security Trustee, the LC Issuer, the Acceptance Lender, nor any Lender
shall have any fiduciary responsibilities to any Obligated Party. Neither the
Agent, the Arranger, the U.K. Security Trustee, the LC Issuer, the Acceptance
Lender, nor any Lender undertakes any responsibility to any Obligated Party to
review or inform such Obligated Party of any matter in connection with any phase
of the other Obligated Parties' business or operations. Each Obligated Party
agrees that neither the Agent, the Arranger, the U.K. Security Trustee, the LC
Issuer, the Acceptance Lender, nor any Lender shall have liability to such
Obligated Party (whether sounding in tort, contract, or otherwise) for losses
suffered by such Obligated Party in connection with, arising out of, or in any
way related to, the transactions contemplated and the relationship established
by the Loan Documents, or any act, omission, or event occurring in connection
therewith, unless it is determined in a final non-appealable judgment by a court
of competent jurisdiction that such losses resulted from the gross negligence or
willful misconduct of the party from which recovery is sought. Neither the
Agent, the Arranger, the U.K. Security Trustee, the LC Issuer, the Acceptance
Lender, nor any Lender shall have any liability with respect to, and each
Obligated Party hereby waives, releases, and agrees not to sue for, any special,
indirect, consequential, or punitive damages suffered by such Obligated Party in
connection with, arising out of, or in any way related to the Loan Documents or
the transactions contemplated thereby.

     Section 9.11 Confidentiality. Each Lender agrees to hold any confidential
information which it may receive from the Obligated Parties pursuant to this

and to other Lenders and their respective Affiliates, (b) to legal counsel,
accountants, and other professional advisors to such Lender or to a Transferee,
(c) to regulatory officials, (d) to any Person as requested pursuant to or as
required by law, regulation, or legal process, (e) to any Person in connection
with any legal proceeding to which such Lender is a party, (f) to such Lender's
direct or indirect contractual counter-parties in swap agreements or to legal
counsel, accountants, and other professional advisors to such counter-parties,

     Section 9.14 Designated Senior Debt. The Obligations under this Agreement
and the other Loan Documents, and all rights, remedies, powers, and privileges

Debentures.

                                   ARTICLE 10

                                    THE AGENT

     Section 10.1 Appointment; Nature of Relationship. Bank One, NA is hereby
appointed by each of the Lenders as its contractual representative (herein
referred to as the "Agent") hereunder and under each other Loan Document, and
each of the Lenders irrevocably authorizes the Agent to act as the contractual
representative of such Lender with the rights and duties expressly set forth
herein and in the other Loan Documents. The Agent agrees to act as such
contractual representative upon the express conditions contained in this Article
10. Notwithstanding the use of the defined term "Agent," it is expressly
understood and agreed that the Agent shall not have any fiduciary
responsibilities to any Lender by reason of this Agreement or any other Loan
Document and that the Agent is merely acting as the contractual representative
of the Lenders with only those duties as are expressly set forth in this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents. In its capacity as the Lenders'
contractual representative, the Agent (a) does not hereby assume any fiduciary
duties to any of the Lenders, (b) is a "representative" of the Lenders within
the meaning of the term "secured party" as defined in the UCC, and (iii) is
acting as an independent contractor, the rights and duties of which are limited
to those expressly set forth in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.
Each of the Lenders hereby agrees to assert no claim against the Agent on any
agency theory or any other theory of liability for breach of fiduciary duty, all
of which claims each Lender hereby waives.

     Section 10.2 Powers. The Agent shall have and may exercise such powers
under the Loan Documents as are specifically delegated to the Agent by the terms
of each thereof, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.
The Agent shall have no implied duties to the Lenders, or any obligation to the
Lenders to take any action thereunder except any action specifically provided by
the Loan Documents to be taken by the Agent.

     Section 10.3 General Immunity. No Agent-Related Party shall be liable to
any Obligated Party or any Lender for any action taken or omitted to be taken by
an Agent-Related Party hereunder or under any other Loan Document or in
connection herewith or therewith except to the extent such action or inaction is
determined in a final non-appealable judgment by a court of competent
jurisdiction to have arisen from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of
such Agent-Related Party.

CREDIT AGREEMENT  Page 101

<PAGE>

     Section 10.4 No Responsibility for Loans, Recitals, etc. No Agent-Related
Party shall be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain, inquire into, or
verify (a) any statement, warranty, or representation made in connection with
any Loan Document or any borrowing hereunder, (b) the performance or observance
of any of the covenants or agreements of any obligor under any Loan Document,
including, without limitation, any agreement by an obligor to furnish
information directly to each Lender, (c) the satisfaction of any condition
specified in Article 4, (d) the existence or possible existence of any Default
or Unmatured Default, (e) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness,
sufficiency, or genuineness of any Loan Document or any other instrument or
writing furnished in connection therewith, (f) the value, sufficiency, creation,
perfection, or priority of any Lien in any Facility Collateral, or (g) the
financial condition of the Obligated Parties or of any Affiliate of any
Obligated Party. The Agent shall have no duty to disclose to the Lenders
information that is not required to be furnished by the Obligated Parties to the
Agent at such time, but is voluntarily furnished by the Obligated Parties to the
Agent (either in its capacity as the Agent or in its individual capacity).

     Section 10.5 Action on Instructions of the Lenders. The Agent shall in all
cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, hereunder and
under any other Loan Document in accordance with written instructions signed by
the Required Lenders, and such instructions and any action taken or failure to
act pursuant thereto shall be binding on all of the Lenders. The Lenders hereby
acknowledge that the Agent shall be under no duty to take any discretionary
action permitted to be taken by it pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement
or any other Loan Document unless it shall be requested in writing to do so by
the Required Lenders. The Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing
to take any action hereunder and under any other Loan Document unless it shall
first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders pro rata against any and
all liability, cost, and expense that it may incur by reason of taking or
continuing to take any such action.

     Section 10.6 Employment of Agents and Counsel. The Agent may execute any of
its duties as the Agent hereunder and under any other Loan Document by or
through employees, agents, and attorneys-in-fact and shall not be answerable to
the Lenders, except as to money or securities received by the Agent or its
authorized agents, for the default or misconduct of any such agents or
attorneys-in-fact selected by the Agent with reasonable care. The Agent shall be
entitled to advice of counsel concerning the contractual arrangement between the
Agent and the Lenders and all matters pertaining to the Agent's duties hereunder
and under any other Loan Document.

     Section 10.7 Reliance on Documents; Counsel. The Agent shall be entitled to
rely upon any Note, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, telegram,
statement, paper, or document believed by it to be genuine and correct and to
have been signed or sent by the proper Person or Persons, and, in respect to
legal matters, upon the opinion of counsel selected by the Agent, which counsel
may be employees of the Agent.

     Section 10.8 The Agent's Reimbursement and Indemnification. The Lenders
agree to reimburse and indemnify the Agent ratably in proportion to their
respective Revolving Commitment (or, if the Revolving Commitments have been
terminated, in proportion to their Revolving Commitment immediately prior to
such termination) (a) for any amounts not reimbursed by the Borrowers for which
the Agent is entitled to reimbursement by the Borrowers

CREDIT AGREEMENT  Page 102

<PAGE>

under the Loan Documents, (b) for any other expenses incurred by the Agent on
behalf of the Lenders, in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery,
administration, and enforcement of the Loan Documents (including, without
limitation, for any expenses incurred by the Agent in connection with any
dispute between the Agent and any Lender or between two or more of the Lenders,
but excluding any such expenses arising as a result of the Agent's gross
negligence or willful misconduct), and (c) for any liabilities, obligations,
losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses, or
disbursements of any kind and nature whatsoever which may be imposed on,
incurred by or asserted against the Agent in any way relating to or arising out
of the Loan Documents or any other document delivered in connection therewith or
the transactions contemplated thereby (including, without limitation, for any
such amounts incurred by or asserted against the Agent in connection with any
dispute between the Agent and any Lender or between two or more of the Lenders,
but excluding any such expenses arising as a result of the Agent's gross
negligence or willful misconduct), or the enforcement of any of the terms of the
Loan Documents or of any such other documents, provided that (y) no Lender shall
be liable for any of the foregoing to the extent any of the foregoing is found
in a final non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have
resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Agent and (z)
any indemnification required pursuant to Section 3.5(g) shall, notwithstanding
the provisions of this Section 10.8, be paid by the relevant Lender in
accordance with the provisions thereof. The obligations of the Lenders under
this Section 10.8 shall survive payment of the Obligations and termination of
this Agreement.

     Section 10.9 Notice of Default. The Agent shall not be deemed to have
knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Unmatured Default
hereunder unless the Agent has received written notice from a Lender (excluding
Bank One) or the Borrowers referring to this Agreement describing such Default
or Unmatured Default and stating that such notice is a "notice of default" and
the Agent shall have had a reasonable opportunity to confirm the existence of
any such described Default or Unmatured Default. In the event that the Agent
receives such a notice, the Agent shall give prompt notice thereof to the
Lenders. Subject to Section 8.2(b), the Agent shall take such action with
respect to such Default or Unmatured Default as may be requested by the Required
Lenders; provided, however, that unless and until the Agent has received any
such request, the Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or
refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default or Unmatured
Default as it shall deem advisable.

     Section 10.10 Rights as a Lender. In its capacity as a Lender, the Agent
shall have the same rights and powers hereunder and under any other Loan
Document with respect to its Revolving Commitment and its Loans as any Lender
and may exercise the same as though it were not the Agent, and the term "Lender"
or "Lenders" shall, at any time when the Agent is a Lender, unless the context
otherwise indicates, include the Agent in its individual capacity. The Agent and
its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, and generally engage in
any kind of trust, debt, equity, or other transaction, in addition to those
contemplated by this Agreement or any other Loan Document, with any Obligated
Party or any of its Affiliates.

     Section 10.11 Lender Credit Decision. Each Lender acknowledges that it has,
independently and without reliance upon the Agent, the Arranger, or any other
Lender and based on the financial statements prepared by the Obligated Parties
and such other documents and

CREDIT AGREEMENT  Page 103

<PAGE>

information as such Lender has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis
and decision to enter into this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Each
Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon
the Agent, the Arranger, or any other Lender and based on such documents and
information as such Lender shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make
its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement and
the other Loan Documents.

     Section 10.12 Successor Agent. The Agent may resign at any time by giving
written notice thereof to the Lenders and the Borrowers, such resignation to be
effective upon the appointment of a successor Agent or, if no successor Agent
has been appointed, 45 days after the retiring Agent gives notice of its
intention to resign. The Agent may be removed at any time with or without cause
by written notice received by the Agent from the Required Lenders, such removal
to be effective on the date specified by the Required Lenders. Upon any such
resignation or removal, the Required Lenders shall have the right to appoint, on
behalf of the Borrowers and the Lenders, a successor Agent. If no successor
Agent shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders within 30 days after
the resigning Agent's giving notice of its intention to resign, then the
resigning Agent may appoint, on behalf of the Borrowers and the Lenders, a
successor Agent. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, the Agent may at any
time without the consent of the Borrowers or any Lender, appoint any of its
Affiliates which is a commercial bank as a successor Agent hereunder. If the
Agent has resigned or been removed and no successor Agent has been appointed,
the Lenders may perform all the duties of the Agent hereunder and the Borrowers
shall make all payments in respect of the Obligations to the applicable Lender
and for all other purposes shall deal directly with the Lenders. No successor
Agent shall be deemed to be appointed hereunder until such successor Agent has
accepted the appointment. Any such successor Agent shall be a commercial bank
having capital and retained earnings of at least $100,000,000. Upon the
acceptance of any appointment as Agent hereunder by a successor Agent, such
successor Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the
rights, powers, privileges, and duties of the resigning or removed Agent. Upon
the effectiveness of the resignation or removal of the Agent, the resigning or
removed Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and
under the Loan Documents. After the effectiveness of the resignation or removal
of an Agent, the provisions of this Article 10 shall continue in effect for the
benefit of such resigning or removed Agent in respect of any actions taken or
omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as the Agent hereunder and under
the other Loan Documents. In the event that there is a successor to the Agent by
merger, or the Agent assigns its duties and obligations to an Affiliate pursuant
to this Section 10.12, then the term "Prime Rate" as used in this Agreement
shall mean the prime rate, base rate, or other analogous rate of the new Agent.

     Section 10.13 Agent Fees. The U.S. Borrowers agree to pay to the Agent, for
its account, the fees specified in that certain letter agreement dated
concurrently herewith, or as otherwise agreed from time to time.

     Section 10.14 Delegation to Affiliates. The Borrowers and the Lenders agree
that the Agent may delegate any of its duties under this Agreement to any of its
Affiliates. Any such Affiliate (and such Affiliate's directors, officers,
agents, and employees) which performs duties in connection with this Agreement
shall be entitled to the same benefits of the indemnification,

<PAGE>

waiver and other protective provisions to which the Agent is entitled under
Article 9 and Article 10.

     Section 10.15 Execution of Loan Documents.

          (a) The Lenders hereby empower and authorize the Agent, on behalf of
     the Agent and the Lenders, to execute and deliver to the Obligated Parties
     the Loan Documents and all related agreements, certificates, documents, or
     instruments as shall be necessary or appropriate to effect the purposes of
     the Loan Documents. Each Lender agrees that any action taken by the Agent
     or the Required Lenders in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or
     the other Loan Documents, and the exercise by the Agent or the Required
     Lenders of their respective powers set forth therein or herein, together
     with such other powers that are reasonably incidental thereto, shall be
     binding upon all of the Lenders. The Lenders acknowledge that all of the
     Obligations hereunder constitute one debt, secured pari passu by all of the
     Facility Collateral.

          (b) Without limiting the generality of clause (a) preceding, for the
     purposes of creating a solidarite active in accordance with Article 1541 of
     the Civil Code of Quebec, between each Lender, taken individually, on the
     one hand, and the Agent, on the other hand, each Obligated Party, each such
     Lender, and the Agent acknowledge and agree that such Lender and the Agent
     are hereby conferred the legal status of solidary creditors of each
     Obligated Party in respect of all Obligations, present and future, owed by
     each Obligated Party to each such Lender and the Agent (collectively, the
     "Solidary Claim"). Each Obligated Party which is not a signatory of this
     Agreement but is or may become a signatory to any other Loan Documents
     shall be deemed to have accepted the provisions contained in this clause
     (b) by its execution of such other Loan Documents. Accordingly, but subject
     (for the avoidance of doubt) to Article 1542 of the Civil Code of Quebec,
     the Obligated Parties are irrevocably bound towards the Agent and each
     Lender in respect of the entire Solidary Claim of the Agent and such
     Lender. As a result of the foregoing, the parties hereto acknowledge that
     the Agent and each Lender shall at all times have a valid and effective
     right of action for the entire Solidary Claim of the Agent and such Lender
     and the right to give full acquittances for it. Accordingly, without
     limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Agent, as solidary creditor
     with each Lender, shall at all times have a valid and effective right of
     action in respect of all Obligations, present and future, owed by each
     Obligated Party to the Agent and Lenders or any of them and the right to
     give a full acquittance for same. The parties further agree and acknowledge
     that the Liens created by the Security Agreements and any other Loan
     Document on the Facility Collateral shall be granted to the Agent, for its
     own benefit and for the benefit of the Lenders.

     Section 10.16 Facility Collateral Matters.

          (a) The Lenders hereby irrevocably authorize the Agent, at its option
     and in its sole discretion, to release or subordinate (as applicable) any
     Liens granted to the Agent by the Obligated Parties on any Facility
     Collateral (i) upon the termination of the Aggregate Commitment and payment
     and satisfaction in full of all Obligations, (ii) constituting Property
     being sold or disposed of if the Obligated Party disposing of

CREDIT AGREEMENT  Page 105

<PAGE>

     such Property certifies to the Agent that the sale or disposition is
     made in compliance with the terms of this Agreement (and the Agent may rely
     conclusively on any such certificate, without further inquiry), (iii)
     constituting Property in which no Obligated Party has at any time during
     the term of this Agreement owned any interest, (iv) constituting property
     leased to an Obligated Party under a lease which has expired or been
     terminated in a transaction permitted under this Agreement, (v) owned by or
     leased to an Obligated Party which is subject to a purchase money security
     interest or which is the subject of a Capitalized Lease, or (vi) as
     required to effect any sale or other disposition of such Facility
     Collateral in connection with any exercise of remedies of the Agent and the
     Lenders pursuant to Section 8.1. Upon request by the Agent or the Obligated
     Parties at any time, the Lenders will confirm in writing the Agent's
     authority to release any Liens upon particular types or items of Facility
     Collateral pursuant to this Section 10.16. Except as provided in the
     preceding sentence, the Agent will not release any Liens on Facility
     Collateral without the prior written authorization of the Required Lenders;
     provided that the Agent may, in its discretion, during any calendar year
     without the prior authorization of the Required Lenders, release its Liens
     on Facility Collateral valued in the aggregate not in excess of $5,000,000.
     Upon request by the Agent or the Obligated Parties at any time, the Lenders
     will confirm in writing the Agent's authority to release its Liens upon
     particular types or items of Facility Collateral pursuant to this Section
     10.16.

          (b) Upon receipt by the Agent of any authorization required pursuant
     to Section 10.16(a) from the Required Lenders of the Agent's authority to
     release any Liens upon particular types or items of Facility Collateral,
     and upon at least five Business Days prior written request by the Obligated
     Parties, the Agent shall (and is hereby irrevocably authorized by the
     Lenders to) execute such documents as may be necessary to evidence the
     release of its Liens upon such Facility Collateral; provided that (i) the
     Agent shall not be required to execute any such document on terms which, in
     the Agent's opinion, would expose the Agent to liability or create any
     obligation or entail any consequence other than the release of such Liens
     without recourse or warranty and (ii) such release shall not in any manner
     discharge, affect, or impair the Obligations or any Liens (other than those
     expressly being released) upon (or obligations of the Obligated Parties in
     respect of) all interests retained by the Obligated Parties, including the
     proceeds of any sale, all of which shall continue to constitute part of the
     Collateral.

          (c) The Agent shall have no obligation whatsoever to any of the
     Lenders to assure that the Facility Collateral exists or is owned by the
     Obligated Parties or is cared for, protected, or insured or has been
     encumbered, or that the Liens granted to the Agent therein have been
     properly or sufficiently or lawfully created, perfected, protected, or
     enforced or are entitled to any particular priority, or to exercise at all
     or in any particular manner or under any duty of care, disclosure, or
     fidelity, or to continue exercising, any of the rights, authorities, and
     powers granted or available to the Agent pursuant to any of the Loan
     Documents, it being understood and agreed that in respect of the Facility
     Collateral, or any act, omission, or event related thereto, the Agent may
     act in any manner it may deem appropriate, in its sole discretion given the
     Agent's own interest in the Facility Collateral in its capacity as one of
     the Lenders and that the Agent shall have no other duty or liability
     whatsoever to any Lender as to any of the foregoing.

     Section 10.17 Agency for Perfection. Each Lender hereby appoints each other
Lender as its agent for the purpose of perfecting Liens, for the benefit of the
Agent and the Lenders, in assets which, in accordance with Article 9 of the UCC,
the PPSA, the Civil Code, or any other applicable law can be perfected only by
possession. Should any Lender (other than the Agent) obtain possession of any
such Facility Collateral, such Lender shall notify the Agent thereof, and,
promptly upon the Agent's request therefor shall deliver such Facility
Collateral to the Agent or otherwise deal with such Facility Collateral in
accordance with the Agent's instructions.

     Section 10.18 Reports. Each Lender hereby agrees as follows: (a) such
Lender is deemed to have requested that the Agent furnish such Lender, promptly
after it becomes available, a copy of each Report prepared by or on behalf of
the Agent; (b) such Lender expressly agrees and acknowledges that neither Bank
One nor the Agent (i) makes any representation or warranty as to the accuracy of
any Report or (ii) shall be liable for any information contained in any Report;
(c) such Lender expressly agrees and acknowledges that the Reports are not
comprehensive audits or examinations, that the Agent, Bank One, or any other
party performing any audit or examination will inspect only specific information
regarding the Obligated Parties and will rely significantly upon the Obligated
Parties' books and records, as well as on representations of the Obligated
Parties' personnel; (d) such Lender agrees to keep all Reports confidential and
strictly for its internal use, and not to distribute any Report other than as
otherwise permitted pursuant to this Agreement; and (e) without limiting the
generality of any other indemnification provision contained in this Agreement,
such Lender agrees (i) to hold the Agent and any such other Person preparing a
Report harmless from any action the indemnifying Lender may take or conclusion
the indemnifying Lender may reach or draw from any Report in connection with any
Credit Extensions that the indemnifying Lender has made or may make to the
Obligated Parties, or the indemnifying Lender's participation in, or the
indemnifying Lender's purchase of, any Obligations and (ii) to pay and protect,
and indemnify, defend, and hold the Agent and any such other Person preparing a
Report harmless from and against, the claims, actions, proceedings, damages,
costs, expenses, and other amounts (including reasonable attorney fees) incurred
by the Agent and any such other Person preparing a Report as the direct or
indirect result of any third parties who might obtain all or part of any Report
through the indemnifying Lender.

     Section 10.19 Co-Agents. None of the Co-agents shall have any right, power,
obligation, liability, responsibility, or duty under any Loan Document other
than those applicable to all Lenders. Without limiting the foregoing, none of
the Co-agents shall have or be deemed to have a fiduciary relationship with any
other Lender. Each Lender hereby makes the same acknowledgments with respect to
each of the Co-agents as it makes with respect to the Agent in Section 10.11.

     Section 10.20 Agent as U.K. Security Trustee.

          (a) In this Agreement, any rights and remedies exercisable by, any
     documents to be delivered to, or any other indemnities or obligations in
     favor of the Agent shall be, as the case may be, exercisable by, delivered
     to, or be indemnities or other obligations in favor of the Agent (or any
     other Person acting in such capacity) in its capacity as U.K. Security
     Trustee to the extent that the rights, remedies, deliveries, indemnities,
     or other

CREDIT AGREEMENT  Page 107

<PAGE>

     obligations relate to the U.K. Security Documents or the security
     thereby created. Any obligations of the Agent in this Agreement shall be
     obligations of the Agent (or any other Person acting in such capacity) in
     its capacity as U.K. Security Trustee to the extent that the obligations
     relate to the U.K. Security Documents or the security thereby created.
     Additionally, in its capacity as U.K. Security Trustee, the Agent (or any
     other Person acting in such capacity) shall have (i) all the rights,
     remedies, and benefits in favor of the Agent contained in the provisions of
     this Article 10, (ii) all the powers of an absolute owner of the security
     constituted by the U.K. Security Documents, and (iii) all the rights,
     remedies, and powers granted to it and be subject to all the obligations
     and duties owed by it under the U.K. Security Documents.

          (b) Each Lender and the Agent hereby appoint the U.K. Security Trustee
     to act as its trustee under and in relation to the U.K. Security Documents
     to which the U.K. Security Trustee is a party pursuant to this Agreement
     and to hold the Trust Property as trustee for the Agent and the Lenders on
     the trust and other terms contained in the U.K. Security Documents to which
     the U.K. Security Trustee is a party and the Agent and each Lender hereby
     irrevocably authorize the U.K. Security Trustee to exercise such rights,
     remedies, powers, and discretions as are specifically delegated to the U.K.
     Security Trustee by the terms of the U.K. Security Documents to which the
     U.K. Security Trustee is party together with all such rights, remedies,
     powers, and discretions as are reasonably incidental thereto.

          (c) Any reference in this Agreement to Liens stated to be in favor of
     the Agent (either expressed in those words or as "Agent's Liens" or
     otherwise) shall be construed so as to include a reference to Liens granted
     in favor of the U.K. Security Trustee.

          (d) The Lenders agree that at any time that the U.K. Security Trustee
     shall be a Person other than the Agent, such other Person shall have the
     rights, remedies, benefits, and powers granted to the Agent in its capacity
     as U.K. Security Trustee in this Agreement.

                                   ARTICLE 11

                            SET-OFF; RATABLE PAYMENTS

     Section 11.1 Set-off. In addition to, and without limitation of, any rights
of the Lenders under applicable law, if any Obligated Party becomes insolvent,
however evidenced, or during the existence of any Default, any and all deposits
(including all account balances, whether provisional or final and whether or not
collected or available) and any other Indebtedness at any time held or owing by
any Lender or any Affiliate of any Lender to or for the credit or account of any
Obligated Party may be set-off and applied toward the payment of the respective
Obligations of such Obligated Party owing to such Lender (subject to the
provisions of Section 11.2), whether or not the Obligations, or any part
thereof, shall then be due. Each Lender agrees promptly to notify the Obligated
Parties and the Agent after any such set-off and application made by such
Lender; provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the
validity of such set-off and application. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, NO
LENDER

CREDIT AGREEMENT  Page 108

<PAGE>

SHALL EXERCISE ANY RIGHT OF SET-OFF, BANKER'S LIEN, OR THE LIKE AGAINST ANY
DEPOSIT ACCOUNT OR PROPERTY OF ANY OBLIGATED PARTY HELD OR MAINTAINED BY SUCH
LENDER WITHOUT THE PRIOR WRITTEN CONSENT OF THE REQUIRED LENDERS.

     Section 11.2 Ratable Payments. If any Lender, whether by set-off or
otherwise, has payment made to it upon its Outstanding Credit Exposure (other
than payments received pursuant to Section 3.1, Section 3.2, Section 3.4, or
Section 3.5) in a greater proportion than that received by any other Lender, the
Lender receiving such payment agrees, promptly upon demand, to purchase in cash
a portion of the Aggregate Outstanding Credit Exposure held by the other Lenders
so that after such purchase each Lender will hold its Pro Rata Share of the
Aggregate Outstanding Credit Exposure; provided that all such purchases shall be
purchases of the Revolving Loans and Reimbursement Obligations unless the
Revolving Loans and Reimbursement Obligations have been paid in full and then
such purchases shall be of the Term Loans B. If any Lender, whether in
connection with set-off or amounts which might be subject to set-off or
otherwise, receives collateral or other protection for its Obligations or such
amounts which may be subject to set-off, such Lender agrees, promptly upon
demand, to take such action necessary such that all Lenders share in the
benefits of such collateral ratably in proportion to their respective Pro Rata
Shares of the Aggregate Outstanding Credit Exposure, subject to the limitation
set forth in the proviso in the preceding sentence. In case any such payment is
disturbed by legal process, or otherwise, appropriate further adjustments shall
be made.

                                   ARTICLE 12

                BENEFIT OF AGREEMENT; ASSIGNMENTS; PARTICIPATIONS

Section 12.1 Successors and Assigns. The terms and provisions of the Loan
Documents shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Obligated
Parties and the Lenders and their respective successors and assigns permitted
hereby, except that (a) the Obligated Parties shall not have the right to assign
their rights or obligations under the Loan Documents without the prior written
consent of each Lender, (b) any assignment by any Lender must be made in
compliance with Section 12.3, and (c) any transfer by a participation must be
made in compliance with Section 12.2. Any attempted assignment or transfer by
any party not made in compliance with this Section 12.1 shall be null and void,
unless such attempted assignment or transfer is treated as a participation made
pursuant to Section 12.2. The parties to this Agreement acknowledge that clause
(b) preceding relates only to absolute assignments and this Section 12.1 does
not prohibit assignments creating security interests, including, without
limitation, (y) any pledge or assignment by any Lender of all or any portion of
its rights under this Agreement and any Note to a Federal Reserve Bank or (z) in
the case of a Lender which is a Fund, any pledge or assignment of all or any
portion of its rights under this Agreement and any Note to its trustee in
support of its obligations to its trustee; provided, however, that no such
pledge or assignment creating a security interest shall release the transferor
Lender from its obligations hereunder unless and until the parties thereto have
complied with the provisions of Section 12.3. The Agent may treat the Person
which made any Loan or which holds any Note as the owner thereof for all
purposes hereof unless and until such Person complies with Section 12.3;
provided, however, that the Agent may in its discretion (but shall not be
required

CREDIT AGREEMENT  Page 109

<PAGE>

to) follow instructions from the Person which made any Loan or which holds any
Note to direct payments relating to such Loan or Note to another Person. Any
assignee of the rights to any Loan or any Note agrees by acceptance of such
assignment to be bound by all the terms and provisions of the Loan Documents.
Any request, authority, or consent of any Person, who at the time of making such
request or giving such authority or consent is the owner of the rights to any
Loan (whether or not a Note has been issued in evidence thereof), shall be
conclusive and binding on any subsequent holder or assignee of the rights to
such Loan.

     Section 12.2 Participations.

          (a) Permitted Participants; Effect. Any Lender may at any time sell to
     one or more banks or other entities ("Participants") participating
     interests in any Outstanding Credit Exposure of such Lender, any Note held
     by such Lender, any Revolving Commitment of such Lender or any other
     interest of such Lender under the Loan Documents. In the event of any such
     sale by a Lender of participating interests to a Participant, such Lender's
     obligations under the Loan Documents shall remain unchanged, such Lender
     shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the
     performance of such obligations, such Lender shall remain the owner of its
     Outstanding Credit Exposure and the holder of any Note issued to it in
     evidence thereof for all purposes under the Loan Documents, all amounts
     payable by the Borrowers under this Agreement shall be determined as if
     such Lender had not sold such participating interests, and the Borrowers
     and the Agent shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender
     in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under the Loan
     Documents.

          (b) Voting Rights. Each Lender shall retain the sole right to approve,
     without the consent of any Participant, any amendment, modification, or
     waiver of any provision of the Loan Documents other than any amendment,
     modification, or waiver with respect to any Credit Extension or Revolving
     Commitment in which such Participant has an interest which would require
     consent of all of the Lenders pursuant to the terms of Section 8.2 or of
     any other Loan Document.

          (c) Benefit of Certain Provisions. The Obligated Parties agree that
     each Participant shall be deemed to have the right of set-off provided in
     Section 11.1 in respect of its participating interest in amounts owing
     under the Loan Documents to the same extent as if the amount of its
     participating interest were owing directly to it as a Lender under the Loan
     Documents, provided that each Lender shall retain the right of set-off
     provided in Section 11.1 with respect to the amount of participating
     interests sold to each Participant. The Lenders agree to share with each
     Participant, and each Participant, by exercising the right of set-off
     provided in Section 11.1, agrees to share with each Lender, any amount
     received pursuant to the exercise of its right of set-off, such amounts to
     be shared in accordance with Section 11.2 as if each Participant were a
     Lender. The Borrowers further agree that each Participant shall be entitled
     to the benefits of Section 3.1, Section 3.2, Section 3.4, and Section 3.5
     to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by
     assignment pursuant to Section 12.3, provided that (i) a Participant shall
     not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 3.1, Section
     3.2, or Section 3.5 than the Lender who sold the participating interest

CREDIT AGREEMENT  Page 110

<PAGE>

     to such Participant would have received had it retained such interest
     for its own account, unless the sale of such interest to such Participant
     is made with the prior written consent of the Borrowers and (ii) any
     Participant not incorporated under the laws of the U.S. or any state
     thereof agrees to comply with the provisions of Section 3.5 to the same
     extent as if it were a Lender.

     Section 12.3 Assignments.

          (a) Permitted Assignments. Any Lender may, in the ordinary course of
     its business and in accordance with applicable law, at any time assign to
     one or more banks or other entities ("Purchasers") all or any part of its
     rights and obligations under the Loan Documents. Such assignment shall be
     substantially in the form of Exhibit F or in such other form as may be
     agreed to by the parties thereto (an "Assignment Agreement). Each such
     assignment with respect to a Purchaser which is not a Lender or an
     Affiliate thereof shall (unless each of the Borrowers and the Agent
     otherwise consents) be in an amount not less than the lesser of (i)
     $5,000,000 each for the Revolving Commitment and the Term Loans B or (ii)
     the remaining amount of the assigning Lender's Revolving Commitment
     (calculated as at the date of such assignment) and Term Loans B or
     outstanding Loans (if the Revolving Commitment has been terminated).

          (b) Consents. The consent of the Borrowers and the Agent shall be
     required prior to an assignment becoming effective with respect to a
     Purchaser which is not a Lender, an Affiliate thereof, or an Approved Fund;
     provided that during the existence of a Default or an Unmatured Default,
     the consent of the Borrowers shall not be required. Any consent required
     pursuant to this Section 12.3(b) shall not be unreasonably withheld or
     delayed.

          (c) Effect; Effective Date. Upon (i) delivery to the Agent of an
     Assignment Agreement, together with any consents required by Section
     12.3(b) and (ii) payment of a $3,500 fee to the Agent for processing such
     assignment, such assignment shall become effective on the effective date
     specified in such Assignment Agreement. Such Assignment Agreement shall
     contain a representation by the Purchaser to the effect that none of the
     consideration used to make the purchase of the Revolving Commitment and
     Outstanding Credit Exposure under such Assignment Agreement are "plan
     assets" as defined under ERISA and that the rights and interests of the
     Purchaser in and under the Loan Documents will not be "plan assets" under
     ERISA. On and after the effective date of such assignment, such Purchaser
     shall for all purposes be a Lender party to this Agreement and any other
     Loan Document executed by or on behalf of the Lenders and shall have all
     the rights and obligations of a Lender under the Loan Documents, to the
     same extent as if such Purchaser were an original party hereto, and no
     further consent or action by the Borrowers, the Lenders, the Agent, the LC
     Issuer, or the Acceptance Lender shall be required to release the
     transferor Lender with respect to the percentage of the Aggregate Revolving
     Commitment and Outstanding Credit Exposure assigned to such Purchaser. Upon
     the consummation of any assignment to a Purchaser pursuant to this Section
     12.3, the transferor Lender, the Agent, and the Borrowers shall, if the
     transferor Lender or the Purchaser desires that its Loans be evidenced by
     Notes, make appropriate arrangements so that new Notes or, as appropriate,
     replacement Notes are issued to such

CREDIT AGREEMENT  Page 111

<PAGE>

     transferor Lender and new Notes or, as appropriate, replacement Notes,
     are issued to such Purchaser, in each case in principal amounts reflecting
     their respective Revolving Commitments and Term Loans B, as adjusted
     pursuant to such assignment.

          (d) Register. The Agent, acting solely for this purpose as a
     contractual agent of the Borrowers, shall maintain at its offices in
     Chicago, Illinois a copy of each Assignment Agreement delivered to it and a
     register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and
     the Revolving Commitments of, and principal amounts of the Loans owing to,
     each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the
     "Register"). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, and the
     Obligated Parties, the Agent, the LC Issuer, the Acceptance Lender, and the
     Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register
     pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this
     Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be
     available for inspection by the Obligated Parties, the LC Issuer, the
     Acceptance Lender, and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to
     time upon reasonable prior notice.

     Section 12.4 Dissemination of Information. The Obligated Parties authorize
each Lender to disclose to any Participant or Purchaser or any other Person
acquiring an interest in the Loan Documents by operation of law (each a
"Transferee") and any prospective Transferee any and all information in such
Lender's possession concerning the credit-worthiness of the Obligated Parties,
including, without limitation, any information contained in any Reports;
provided that each Transferee and prospective Transferee agrees to be bound by
Section 9.11.

     Section 12.5 Tax Treatment. If any interest in any Loan Document is
transferred to any Transferee which is not incorporated under the laws of the
U.S. or any state thereof, the transferor Lender shall cause such Transferee,
concurrently with the effectiveness of such transfer, to comply with the
provisions of Section 3.5(d).

(a) in the case of each Obligated Party, at the address or facsimile number of
the Parent set forth on its signature page hereto, (b) in the case of the Agent

such party may hereafter specify for the purpose by notice to the Agent and the
Obligated Parties in accordance with the provisions of this Section 13.1. Each

hours after such communication is deposited in the U.S. mail with first class
postage

prepaid, addressed as aforesaid, or (z) if given by any other means, when
delivered (or, in the case of electronic transmission, received) at the address
specified in this Section; provided that notices to the Agent under Article 2
shall not be effective until received.

     Section 13.2 Change of Address. Any Obligated Party, the Agent, and any
Lender may each change the address for service of notice upon it by a notice in
writing to the other parties hereto.

                                   ARTICLE 14

                                  COUNTERPARTS

     Section 14.1 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, all of which taken together shall constitute one agreement, and
any of the parties hereto may execute this Agreement by signing any such

                      RELATIONSHIP OF THE OBLIGATED PARTIES

     Section 16.1 Joint and Several Liability.

          (a) All Loans to the U.K. Borrowers, upon funding, shall be deemed to
     be jointly funded to and received by the U.K. Borrowers. Each U.K. Borrower
     jointly and severally agrees to pay, and shall be jointly and severally
     liable under this Agreement for, all U.K. Obligations, regardless of the
     manner or amount in which proceeds of any Loans are used, allocated,
     shared, or disbursed by or among the U.K. Borrowers themselves, or the
     manner in which the Agent and/or any Lender accounts for such Loans or
     other extensions of credit on its books and records. Each U.K. Borrower
     shall be liable for all amounts due to the Agent or any Lender under this
     Agreement which constitute U.K. Obligations, regardless of which U.K.
     Borrower actually receives Loans or other extensions of credit hereunder or
     the amount of such Loans and extensions of credit received or the manner in
     which the Agent or such Lender accounts for such Loans or other extensions
     of credit on its books and records. Each U.K. Borrower's obligations with
     respect to Loans and other extensions of credit made to it, and such U.K.
     Borrower's obligations arising as a result of the joint and several
     liability of such U.K. Borrower hereunder, with respect to Loans made to
     the other U.K. Borrowers hereunder, shall be separate and distinct
     obligations, but all such U.K. Obligations shall be primary obligations of
     such U.K. Borrower. The U.K. Borrowers acknowledge and expressly agree with
     the Agent and each Lender that the joint and several liability of each U.K.
     Borrower is required solely as a condition to, and is given solely as
     inducement for and in consideration of, credit or accommodations extended
     or to be extended under the Loan Documents to any or all of the other U.K.
     Borrowers and is not required or given as a condition of extensions of
     credit to such U.K. Borrower. Each U.K. Borrower's obligations under this
     Agreement and as an obligor under a U.K. Guaranty Agreement shall be
     separate and distinct obligations. Each U.K. Borrower's obligations under
     this Agreement shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be
     unconditional irrespective of (i) the validity or enforceability,
     avoidance, or subordination of the U.K. Obligations of any other U.K.
     Borrower or of any promissory note or other document evidencing all or any
     part of the U.K. Obligations of any other U.K. Borrower, (ii) the absence
     of any attempt to collect the U.K. Obligations from any other U.K.
     Borrower, any U.K. Guarantor, or any other security therefor, or the
     absence of any other action to enforce the same, (iii) the waiver, consent,
     extension, forbearance, or granting of any indulgence by

CREDIT AGREEMENT  Page 114

<PAGE>

     the Agent or any Lender with respect to any provision of any
     instrument evidencing the U.K. Obligations of any other U.K. Borrower or
     U.K. Guarantor, or any part thereof, or any other agreement now or
     hereafter executed by any other U.K. Borrower or U.K. Guarantor and
     delivered to the Agent or any Lender, (iv) the failure by the Agent or any
     Lender to take any steps to perfect and maintain its security interest in,
     or to preserve its rights to, any security or collateral for the U.K.
     Obligations of any other U.K. Borrower or U.K. Guarantor, (v) the
     disallowance of all or any portion of the Agent's or any Lender's claim(s)
     for the repayment of the U.K. Obligations of any other U.K. Borrower under
     any provision of applicable law, or (vi) any other circumstances which
     might constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a U.K.
     Guarantor or of any other U.K. Borrower. With respect to any U.K.
     Borrower's Obligations arising as a result of the joint and several
     liability of the U.K. Borrowers hereunder with respect to Loans or other
     extensions of credit made to any of the other U.K. Borrowers hereunder,
     such U.K. Borrower waives, until the U.K. Obligations shall have been paid
     in full and this Agreement shall have been terminated, any right to enforce
     any right of subrogation or any remedy which the Agent or any Lender now
     has or may hereafter have against any other U.K. Borrower, any endorser or
     any U.K. Guarantor of all or any part of the U.K. Obligations, and any
     benefit of, and any right to participate in, any security or collateral
     given to the Agent or any Lender to secure payment of the U.K. Obligations
     or any other liability of any U.K. Borrower to the Agent or any Lender.
     Upon the occurrence of any Default, the Agent may proceed directly and at
     once, without notice, against any U.K. Borrower to collect and recover the
     full amount, or any portion of the U.K. Obligations, without first
     proceeding against any other U.K. Borrower or any other Person, or against
     any security or collateral for the U.K. Obligations. Each U.K. Borrower
     consents and agrees that the Agent shall be under no obligation to marshal
     any assets in favor of any U.K. Borrower or against or in payment of any or
     all of the U.K. Obligations.

          (b) All Loans to the U.S. Borrowers, upon funding, shall be deemed to
     be jointly funded to and received by the U.S. Borrowers. Each U.S. Borrower
     jointly and severally agrees to pay, and shall be jointly and severally
     liable under this Agreement for, all U.S. Obligations, regardless of the
     manner or amount in which proceeds of any Loans are used, allocated,
     shared, or disbursed by or among the U.S. Borrowers themselves, or the
     manner in which the Agent and/or any Lender accounts for such Loans or
     other extensions of credit on its books and records. Each U.S. Borrower
     shall be liable for all amounts due to the Agent or any Lender under this
     Agreement which constitute U.S. Obligations, regardless of which U.S.
     Borrower actually receives Loans or other extensions of credit hereunder or
     the amount of such Loans and extensions of credit received or the manner in
     which the Agent or such Lender accounts for such Loans or other extensions
     of credit on its books and records. Each U.S. Borrower's obligations with
     respect to Loans and other extensions of credit made to it, and such U.S.
     Borrower's obligations arising as a result of the joint and several
     liability of such U.S. Borrower hereunder, with respect to Loans made to
     the other U.S. Borrowers hereunder, shall be separate and distinct
     obligations, but all such U.S. Obligations shall be primary obligations of
     such U.S. Borrower. The U.S. Borrowers acknowledge and expressly agree with
     the Agent and each Lender that the joint and several liability of each U.S.
     Borrower is required solely as a condition to, and is given solely as
     inducement for and in consideration of, credit or accommodations extended
     or to be extended under the Loan

<PAGE>

     Documents to any or all of the other U.S. Borrowers and is not
     required or given as a condition of extensions of credit to such U.S.
     Borrower. Each U.S. Borrower's obligations under this Agreement and as an
     obligor under a U.S. Guaranty Agreement shall be separate and distinct
     obligations. Each U.S. Borrower's obligations under this Agreement shall,
     to the fullest extent permitted by law, be unconditional irrespective of
     (i) the validity or enforceability, avoidance, or subordination of the U.S.
     Obligations of any other U.S. Borrower or of any promissory note or other
     document evidencing all or any part of the U.S. Obligations of any other
     U.S. Borrower, (ii) the absence of any attempt to collect the U.S.
     Obligations from any other U.S. Borrower, any U.S. Guarantor, or any other
     security therefor, or the absence of any other action to enforce the same,
     (iii) the waiver, consent, extension, forbearance, or granting of any
     indulgence by the Agent or any Lender with respect to any provision of any
     instrument evidencing the U.S. Obligations of any other U.S. Borrower or
     U.S. Guarantor, or any part thereof, or any other agreement now or
     hereafter executed by any other U.S. Borrower or U.S. Guarantor and
     delivered to the Agent or any Lender, (iv) the failure by the Agent or any
     Lender to take any steps to perfect and maintain its security interest in,
     or to preserve its rights to, any security or collateral for the U.S.
     Obligations of any other U.S. Borrower or U.S. Guarantor, (v) the Agent's
     or any Lender's election, in any proceeding instituted under the Bankruptcy
     Code, of the application of Section 1111(b)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code, (vi)
     any borrowing or grant of a security interest by any other U.S. Borrower,
     as debtor-in-possession under Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code, (vii) the
     disallowance of all or any portion of the Agent's or any Lender's claim(s)
     for the repayment of the U.S. Obligations of any other U.S. Borrower under
     Section 502 of the Bankruptcy Code, or (viii) any other circumstances which
     might constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a U.S.
     Guarantor or of any other U.S. Borrower. With respect to any U.S.
     Borrower's Obligations arising as a result of the joint and several
     liability of the U.S. Borrowers hereunder with respect to Loans or other
     extensions of credit made to any of the other U.S. Borrowers hereunder,
     such U.S. Borrower waives, until the U.S. Obligations shall have been paid
     in full and this Agreement shall have been terminated, any right to enforce
     any right of subrogation or any remedy which the Agent or any Lender now
     has or may hereafter have against any other U.S. Borrower, any endorser or
     any U.S. Guarantor of all or any part of the U.S. Obligations, and any
     benefit of, and any right to participate in, any security or collateral
     given to the Agent or any Lender to secure payment of the U.S. Obligations
     or any other liability of any U.S. Borrower to the Agent or any Lender.
     Upon the occurrence of any Default, the Agent may proceed directly and at
     once, without notice, against any U.S. Borrower to collect and recover the
     full amount, or any portion of the U.S. Obligations, without first
     proceeding against any other U.S. Borrower or any other Person, or against
     any security or collateral for the U.S. Obligations. Each U.S. Borrower
     consents and agrees that the Agent shall be under no obligation to marshal
     any assets in favor of any U.S. Borrower or against or in payment of any or
     all of the U.S. Obligations.

          (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement:

               (i) the Canadian Obligated Parties shall not be required to make
          any payment with respect to, or provide any Facility Collateral as
          security for, the U.K. Obligations or the U.S. Obligations; and

CREDIT AGREEMENT  Page 116

<PAGE>

               (ii) the U.K. Obligated Parties shall not be required to make any
          payment with respect to, or provide any Facility Collateral as
          security for, the Canadian Obligations or the U.S. Obligations.

     Section 16.2 Contribution and Indemnification Among the U.S. Borrowers.
Each U.S. Borrower is obligated to repay the U.S. Obligations as joint and
several obligors under this Agreement. To the extent that any U.S. Borrower
shall, under this Agreement as a joint and several obligor, repay (directly or
by application of proceeds of Facility Collateral provided by such U.S.
Borrower) any of the U.S. Obligations constituting Loans made to another U.S.
Borrower hereunder or other U.S. Obligations incurred directly and primarily by
any other U.S. Borrower (an "Accommodation Payment"), then the U.S. Borrower
making such Accommodation Payment shall be entitled to contribution and
indemnification from, and be reimbursed by, each of the other U.S. Borrowers in
an amount, for each of such other U.S. Borrowers, equal to its pro rata share of
such Accommodation Payment. For the purposes of this Section 16.2, each
nonpaying U.S. Borrower's "pro rata share" with respect to any Accommodation
Payment shall be determined as of the date on which such Accommodation Payment
was made by reference to the ratio of (a) such nonpaying U.S. Borrower's Maximum
Liability as of such date (without giving effect to any right to receive, or
obligation to make, any contribution hereunder) or, if such nonpaying U.S.
Borrower's Maximum Liability has not been determined, the aggregate amount of
all monies received (and not repaid or returned) by such nonpaying U.S. Borrower
from any Lenders or any other U.S. Borrower after the date hereof (whether by
loan, capital infusion, or by other means) to (b) the aggregate Maximum
Liability of all U.S. Borrowers (including such paying U.S. Borrower) as of such
date (without giving effect to any right to receive, or obligation to make, any
contribution hereunder), or to the extent that a Maximum Liability has not been
determined for any U.S. Borrower, the aggregate amount of all monies received
(and not repaid or returned) by such U.S. Borrowers from any Lenders or any
other U.S. Borrower after the date hereof (whether by loan, capital infusion, or
by other means). Nothing in this Section 16.2 shall affect any U.S. Borrower's
joint and several liability for the entire amount of the U.S. Obligations (up to
such U. S. Borrower's Maximum Liability). As used herein, a U.S. Borrowers'
"Maximum Liability" is the highest amount payable as provided in this Section
16.2 that is valid and enforceable as is or would be determined in any action or
proceeding involving any state corporate law, or any state, federal, or foreign
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, or other law effecting the rights of
creditors generally, up to but not equaling any amount that would otherwise be
held or determined to be avoidable, invalid, or unenforceable on the account of
the amount of such U.S. Borrowers' liability under this Section 16.2. The
provisions of this Section 16.2 are for the benefit of the Agent, the Lenders,
and the U.S. Borrowers and may be enforced by any one, or more, or all of them
in accordance with the terms hereof. All rights and claims of contribution,
indemnification, and reimbursement under this Section shall be subordinate in
right of payment to the prior payment in full of the U.S. Obligations. The
provisions of this Section shall, to the extent expressly inconsistent with any
provision in any Loan Document, supersede such inconsistent provision.

     Section 16.3 Agency of the Parent for Each Other Obligated Party. Each of
the other Obligated Parties irrevocably appoints the Parent as its agent for all
purposes relevant to this Agreement, including the giving and receipt of notices
and execution and delivery of all documents, instruments, and certificates
contemplated herein (including, without limitation, execution and delivery to
the Agent of Borrowing Base Certificates and Borrowing Notices) and

CREDIT AGREEMENT  Page 117

<PAGE>

all modifications hereto. Any acknowledgment, consent, direction, certification,
or other action which might otherwise be valid or effective only if given or
taken by all or any of the Obligated Parties or acting singly, shall be valid
and effective if given or taken only by the Parent, whether or not any of the
other Obligated Parties joins therein, and the Agent and the Lenders shall have
no duty or obligation to make further inquiry with respect to the authority of
the Parent under this Section 16.3, provided that nothing in this Section 16.3
shall limit the effectiveness of, or the right of the Agent and the Lenders to
rely upon, any notice (including, without limitation, any Borrowing Notice),
document, instrument, certificate, acknowledgment, consent, direction,
certification, or other action delivered by any Obligated Party pursuant to this
Agreement.

     Section 16.4 Additional Borrowers and Guarantors. Addition of any Person as
a Borrower or a Guarantor to this Agreement is subject to approval of the Agent
and the Required Lenders, and may be conditioned upon such requirements as they
may determine in their discretion, including, without limitation, (a) the
furnishing of such financial and other information as the Agent or any such
Lender may request, (b) approval by all appropriate approval authorities of the
Agent and each such Lender, and (c) execution and delivery by the Obligated
Parties, such Person, the Agent, and the Required Lenders of such agreements and
other documentation (including, without limitation, an amendment to this
Agreement or any other Loan Document), and the furnishing by such Person or any
of the Obligated Parties of such certificates, opinions, and other
documentation, as the Agent and any such Lender may request. Neither the Agent
nor any Lender shall have any obligation to approve any such Person for addition
as a party to this Agreement.

     Section 16.5 Express Waivers By the Obligated Parties In Respect of Cross
Guaranties and Cross Collateralization. Each Obligated Party agrees as follows:

          (a) Each Obligated Party hereby waives: (i) notice of acceptance of
     this Agreement; (ii) notice of the making of any Loan or Advance, the
     issuance of any Facility LC, or any other financial accommodations made or
     extended under the Loan Documents or the creation or existence of any
     Obligations; (iii) notice of the amount of the Obligations, subject,
     however, to such Obligated Party's right to make inquiry of the Agent to
     ascertain the amount of the Obligations at any reasonable time; (iv) notice
     of any adverse change in the financial condition of any other Obligated
     Party or of any other fact that might increase such Obligated Party's risk
     with respect to such other Obligated Party under the Loan Documents; (v)
     notice of presentment for payment, demand, protest, and notice thereof as
     to any promissory notes or other instruments among the Loan Documents; and
     (vii) all other notices (except if such notice is specifically required to
     be given to such Obligated Party hereunder or under any of the other Loan
     Documents to which such Obligated Party is a party) and demands to which
     such Obligated Party might otherwise be entitled.

          (b) Each Obligated Party hereby waives the right by statute or
     otherwise to require the Agent or any Lender to institute suit against any
     other Obligated Party or to exhaust any rights and remedies which the Agent
     or any Lender has or may have against any other Obligated Party. Each
     Obligated Party further waives any defense arising by reason of any
     disability or other defense of any other Obligated Party (other than the
     defense that the Obligations shall have been fully and finally performed
     and indefeasibly

CREDIT AGREEMENT  Page 118

<PAGE>

     paid) or by reason of the cessation from any cause whatsoever of the
     liability of any such Obligated Party in respect thereof.

          (c) Each Obligated Party hereby waives and agrees not to assert
     against the Agent, any Lender, the LC Issuer, or the Acceptance Lender: (i)
     any defense (legal or equitable), setoff, counterclaim, or claim which such
     Obligated Party may now or at any time hereafter have against any other
     Obligated Party or any other party liable under the Loan Documents; (ii)
     any defense, setoff, counterclaim, or claim of any kind or nature available
     to any other Obligated Party against the Agent, any Lender, the LC Issuer,
     or the Acceptance Lender, arising directly or indirectly from the present
     or future lack of perfection, sufficiency, validity, or enforceability of
     the Obligations or any security therefor; (iii) any right or defense
     arising by reason of any claim or defense based upon an election of
     remedies by the Agent, any Lender, the LC Issuer, or the Acceptance Lender
     under any applicable law; (iv) the benefit of any statute of limitations
     affecting any other Obligated Party's liability hereunder.

          (d) Each Obligated Party consents and agrees that, without notice to
     or by such Obligated Party and without affecting or impairing the
     obligations of such Obligated Party hereunder, the Agent may (subject to
     any requirement for consent of any of the Lenders to the extent required by
     this Agreement), by action or inaction: (i) compromise, settle, extend the
     duration or the time for the payment of, or discharge the performance of,
     or may refuse to or otherwise not enforce the Loan Documents; (ii) release
     all or any one or more parties to any one or more of the Loan Documents or
     grant other indulgences to any other Obligated Party in respect thereof;
     (iii) amend or modify in any manner and at any time (or from time to time)
     any of the Loan Documents; or (iv) release or substitute any Person liable
     for payment of the Obligations, or enforce, exchange, release, or waive any
     security for the Obligations or any guaranty of the Obligations.

          (e) Each of the terms and provisions of Section 6.1 of each of the
     Parent Guaranty Agreement and the U.S. Subsidiary Guaranty Agreement are
     expressly incorporated herein by this reference, mutatis mutandis, and are
     hereby made applicable to each Obligated Party under this Agreement with
     the same force and effect as if fully set forth herein.

Each Obligated Party represents and warrants to the Agent and the Lenders that
such Obligated Party is currently informed of the financial condition of all
other Obligated Parties and all other circumstances which a diligent inquiry
would reveal and which bear upon the risk of nonpayment of the Obligations. Each
Obligated Party further represents and warrants that such Obligated Party has
read and understands the terms and conditions of the Loan Documents. Each
Obligated Party agrees that neither the Agent, any Lender, the LC Issuer, nor
the Acceptance Lender has any responsibility to inform any Obligated Party of
the financial condition of any other Obligated Party or of any other
circumstances which bear upon the risk of nonpayment or nonperformance of the
Obligations.
