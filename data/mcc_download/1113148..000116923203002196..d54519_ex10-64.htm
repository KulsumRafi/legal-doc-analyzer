The Parties specifically understand, acknowledge and agree that this is a full and final release, applying to all of HAGLER&#146;s Claims, whether known or unknown, against the COMPANY Releasees, or any of them.

No failure or delay by a Party in exercising any right, power, or privilege hereunder or other conduct by a Party shall operate as a waiver thereof, in the particular case or in any past or future case, and no single or partial exercise thereof shall preclude the full exercise or further exercise of any right, power, or
privilege. No action taken pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to constitute a waiver by the Party taking such action of compliance with any representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained herein.</font></p>

HAGLER acknowledges that COMPANY committed to him that if HAGLER decided to sign it in less than 22 days, HAGLER would do so voluntarily and of his own free will. HAGLER also acknowledges that COMPANY made clear that its November 18, 2002 offer to enter into this Agreement would not be withdrawn or altered even if HAGLER took the full 22 days, and that he would receive no different terms if he signed before the full 22 days or if he took the full 22 days. The Agreement has been changed from its original form at HAGLER&#146;s request. HAGLER acknowledges that HAGLER
has read and understands this Agreement, and that HAGLER has been encouraged to consult and has consulted an attorney and obtained independent legal advice regarding this Agreement. HAGLER has not been coerced into signing this Agreement and is entering into this Agreement voluntarily and of HAGLER&#146;s own free will. HAGLER further acknowledges that the waivers HAGLER is making in this Agreement are knowing, conscious and voluntary and are made with full appreciation that HAGLER is forever foreclosed from pursuing any of the rights so waived.</font></p>
