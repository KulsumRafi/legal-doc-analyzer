<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE=2><B>EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THIS EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT (the "Agreement") is made and entered into as of this 18th day of October, 2002 (the "Effective Date"), by and between
VitalStream,&nbsp;Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and Kevin D. Herzog ("Employee"). In consideration of the mutual covenants set forth below, the Company and Employee hereby agree as
follows: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At Will Employment.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company hereby employs Employee, and Employee hereby accepts employment by the
Company. The parties acknowledge and agree that the Employee's employment relationship is "at-will", meaning that either party may terminate the employment relationship for any reason at
any time, with or without cause or prior notice. Any termination of Employee by the Company shall be by action of the Board of Directors of the Company. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Services.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employee shall serve as Chief Financial Officer of the Company and perform such services for the
Company as are customary for such position and as may be assigned to him from time to time by the Board of Directors of the Company. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Restrictive Covenant During Term.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During his employment by the Company, Employee shall devote his full time
and services exclusively to the Company and will not, without the prior written consent of the Board of Directors of the Company, own, either directly or indirectly, any interest in any
privately-held business or commercial enterprise which is competitive with the business conducted by the Company. Furthermore, Employee shall not, without the prior written consent of the
Board of Directors of the Company, serve as a partner, officer, director, advisor or employee of, or act in any other similar capacity for, any business or commercial enterprise which is competitive
with the business conducted by the Company. However, nothing contained in this Paragraph&nbsp;3 shall be construed to prohibit Employee from purchasing the capital stock or other securities of any
corporation or other business entity whose stock or securities are traded on any national or regional securities exchange or in the national over-the-counter market. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.01</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Base Salary.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As compensation for the services to be performed hereunder, Employee shall receive an annual
salary of $120,000 (once the 10% cut is reversed, which will occur upon closing of the Epoch APA transaction, or if the APA does not close, then at a date to be determined by VitalStream's Board of
Directors). However, Employee's annual salary shall increase to $145,000 ("Salary"), and such new Salary amount (from the current pre-10% cut $120,000 annual level) will go into effect
after the Company has achieved positive EBITDA (as is reported in the Company's 10-Q/10-K filings) for three consecutive calendar&nbsp;months, retroactive to the first month
in the three consecutive month period. The Salary hereinabove set forth shall be subject to adjustment upward, but not downward, in the sole and absolute discretion of the Company's Board of
Directors. All Salary hereunder shall be payable in accordance with the Company's customary payroll practices and subject to federal and state withholding requirements. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.02</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonuses.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employee will have the ability to earn an amount of up to 35% of the annual Salary amount as an
annual bonus. The bonus, if earned, would be paid within 30&nbsp;days of the end of the fiscal year. The bonus will be strictly performance-based. Management will work with the Compensation
Committee of the Board of Directors ("Committee") to define the upcoming fiscal year's targets, and then submit a written proposal of the targets to the Committee prior to the start of the new fiscal
year. The Committee will then either approve or request modifications to be made to the targets. If Employee's employment is terminated for any reason during a bonus year, the Employee will receive
the payment of their pro-rata share of the bonus within 30&nbsp;days of the end of the fiscal year. The Committee will make the final determination as to whether the bonus is earned or
not, based upon review of historical actual results against the pre-approved targets. </FONT></P>

termination of employment, an amount equal to one&nbsp;years' Salary at the annual rate of Salary being paid to Employee at the effective date of the termination of employment. Such payment to be

Employee any accrued but unpaid compensation earned by Employee through the effective date of the termination of his employment. As used herein, the term "Cause" shall mean (a)&nbsp;Employee's
conviction of, or plea of </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>nolo contendre</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> in, in any criminal action involving a felony, (b)&nbsp;Employee's misappropriation of any material funds or
property of the Company, or (c)&nbsp;Employee's
willful misconduct in the performance of his duties for the Company. In the event that Employee elects to terminate his employment with the Company following a material change in the terms and
conditions of his employment (such as a material diminution in Employee's authority, a material change in Employee's title or duties, a change in the principal place of Employee's employment
materially increasing Employee's commute time, or similar changes), such termination by Employee shall be deemed a termination by the Company and Employee will be entitled to payments from the Company
on the basis described above. The payments described in this Section&nbsp;4.04 shall constitute the entirety of the compensation payable to Employee by the Company upon a termination of his
employment with the Company. </FONT></P>
