apply promptly to the Bankruptcy Court pursuant to sections 327(a) and 328(a) of the Bankruptcy Code and Rule&nbsp;2014 of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, for approval of (a)&nbsp;this
Agreement and (b)&nbsp;HPI's retention by Magellan under the terms of this Agreement, nunc pro tunc to the date of commencement of such case or cases, and shall use its best efforts to obtain
Bankruptcy Court authorization thereof. Magellan shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain such Bankruptcy Court approval and authorization subject only to the subsequent review by the
Bankruptcy Court under the standard of review provided in section&nbsp;328(a) of the Bankruptcy Code, and not subject to the standard of review set forth in section&nbsp;330 of the Bankruptcy
Code. Magellan shall supply HPI and its counsel with a draft of such application and any proposed order authorizing HPI's retention sufficiently in
advance of the filing of such application and proposed order to enable HPI and its counsel to review and comment thereon. </FONT></P>

(ii)&nbsp;any applicable fee and expense guidelines and/or orders and (iii)&nbsp;any requirements governing interim and final fee applications. In the event that HPI's engagement hereunder is
approved by the Bankruptcy Court, Magellan shall pay all fees and expenses of HPI hereunder as promptly as practicable in accordance with the terms hereof and the orders governing interim and final
fee applications, and after obtaining all necessary further approvals from the Bankruptcy Court, if any. After commencement of a case or cases under chapter 11, if the monthly payments pursuant to
paragraph&nbsp;2(a) are not being made currently, HPI shall have no obligation to provide any services under this Agreement unless and until HPI's retention under the terms of this Agreement is
approved in the manner set forth above and any such approval order of the Bankruptcy Court is not subject to appeal, rehearing, reconsideration or petition for certiorari, and which order is
reasonably acceptable to HPI in all material respects. </FONT></P>

any such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense to the extent it is found in a final judgment by a court

have any liability (whether direct or indirect, in contract or tort or otherwise) to Magellan for or in connection with the engagement of HPI, except to the extent for any such liability for losses,
claims, damages, liabilities or expenses that are found in a final judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction (not subject to further appeal) to have resulted from such Indemnified Party's gross

pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which such Indemnified Party seeks indemnification hereunder (whether or not such Indemnified Party is an actual party to such
claim, action, suit or proceedings) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liabilities arising out of such claim, action,
suit or proceeding, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. </FONT></P>

action, proceeding or investigation in which such Indemnified Party is a party or is threatened to be made a party or otherwise is participating in by reason of the Engagement under the Agreement,
upon submission of detailed invoices therefor, whether in advance of the final disposition of such action, proceeding, or investigation or otherwise. Each Indemnified Party hereby undertakes, and
Magellan hereby accepts its undertaking, to repay any and all such amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to be indemnified therefor. If

connection with any motion, action or claim made either in support of or in opposition to any such retention or authorization, whether in advance of or following any judicial disposition of such
motion, action or claim, promptly upon submission of invoices therefor and regardless of whether such retention or authorization is approved by any court. Magellan will also promptly pay the
Indemnified Parties for any reasonable expenses incurred by them, including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, in seeking payment of all amounts owed it under the Agreement (or any new
