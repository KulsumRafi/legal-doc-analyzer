I am pleased to inform you that you have been selected to participate in Grace's
2002-2004 Long-Term Incentive Program. The 2002 Long-Term Incentive Program
provides for 100% of the value of your award to be paid in cash.

LTIP CASH PAYOUT

Your 2002 LTIP payout will be based on the average annual growth rate (AAGR) in
total Grace core EBIT achieved during the 3-year performance period (i.e.
2002-2004). The target AAGR is 6%, using 2001 results as the base. The payout
will vary with actual results as described in Annex B attached to your award.

Under U.S. federal income tax law, the value of the cash payments, when
received, will constitute ordinary income and will trigger income tax
withholding obligations at that time. If you are subject to taxes in a country
other than the United States, the tax consequences of the receipt of cash will
be determined under the laws of such country.

ENCLOSURES

o   Two copies of your 2002 LTIP Award
o   Sample Calculation of the 2002-2004 LTIP (which constitutes part of Annex B)
o   Administrative Practices - Long-Term Cash Award Program (which constitutes
    Annex C)

REQUIRED ACTIONS

Please promptly sign and return one copy of the cash award to Marihelen Johnson
in the Columbia office.

ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS

If you have any questions on this program, please feel free to call me at (410)

                          CALCULATION OF 2002-2004 LTIP


Name of Participant:       ______________________________

Targeted Award:            ______________________________

Your 2002-2004 LTIP award payout will be based on the 3-year average annual
growth rate (AAGR) in total Grace core earnings before interest and taxes (core
EBIT). Payouts are contingent upon achievement of target AAGR for the 3-year
performance period. The target AAGR is 6%, using 2001 results as the base year.

The core earnings before interest and taxes (core EBIT) in 2001 was $187.5
million. The chart below details five scenarios at different assumed growth
rates. The target growth is highlighted.

(1) All results include full recognition/accrual of Annual Incentive
Compensation Program and, for achievement levels above 6% (i.e., 10%, 15%, and
25%), all totals include accruals for Long-Term Incentive Program Payments

(2) Up to the first $11.8 million (target AAGR 6%) is deducted from reported
results. Payouts over target ($11.8 million) must be accrued as part of reported
earnings. As a result, actual growth rate is slightly lower than assumed growth
rate.

individual.


PLAN ADMINISTRATION

The Plan shall be administered by the Committee, provided that no member of the
Committee shall be eligible to receive a Long-Term Cash Award while serving on
the Committee.

The Committee shall approve (i) the performance measurements and objectives for
each Long-Term Cash Award and (ii) the Performance Period over which a Long-Term
Cash Award is to be earned.

The Committee shall approve (i) the Key Employees who are to be granted
Long-Term Cash Awards and (ii) the Targeted Award subject to each Long-Term Cash
Award.


LONG-TERM CASH AWARDS

The Committee may, at any time or from time to time, grant Long-Term Cash Awards
to Key Employees.

Each Long-Term Cash Award shall be evidenced by a written instrument containing
such terms and conditions as the Committee shall approve, provided the
instrument is consistent with these practices.

No Long-Term Cash Award, nor any payment or right thereunder, shall be subject
in any manner to alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance or
charge, except by will or the laws of descent and distribution, or by the terms
of a Participant's Designation of Beneficiary, if any, on file with the Company.

<PAGE>

                                      -6-

In the case of a Key Employee who becomes a Participant after the beginning of a
Performance Period, the Committee may ratably reduce the amount of the Targeted
Award covered by such Employee's Long-Term Cash Award or otherwise appropriately
adjust the terms of the Long-Term Cash Award to reflect the fact that the Key
Employee is to be a Participant for only part of the Performance Period.

It is the intention of the Committee that Long-Term Cash Awards be related to
the results of the core operations affected by the management actions taken by
the Participants. Subject to the administrative practices that apply to
termination or change in employment status and to the amendment or
discontinuance of Long-Term Cash Awards, the performance objectives applicable
to Long-Term Cash Awards will remain unchanged during the Performance Period
except as follows:

o   In the event of the divestment of a Business prior to completion of the
    Performance Period, both the performance objectives and results pertaining
    to that Business shall be eliminated for the full year in which the
    divestment occurs and for any subsequent years.

o   In general, acquisitions will be included in the performance results.


TERMINATION OR CHANGE IN EMPLOYMENT STATUS

A Participant shall forfeit all rights to any Award Payment, if, prior to the
date of payment of such Award Payment, the Participant (1) resigns without the
consent of the Committee, (2) retires under a retirement plan of the Company or
Subsidiary before age 62 without the consent of the Committee, or (3) is
terminated for cause.

If a Participant retires under a retirement plan of the Company or Subsidiary at
or after age 62, or ceases employment as a result of death or disability, or
ceases employment as a result of an involuntary termination after a Change in
Control of the Company (as defined herein), during a Performance Period, then
his rights in any Incomplete Long-Term Cash Award related to that Performance
Period shall thereupon vest, and he shall be entitled to receive any Award
Payment of any Long-Term Cash Award Earned he would otherwise have received (at
the time he would have otherwise received the Award Payment), except that the
amount of any Long-Term Cash Award Earned shall be reduced ratably in proportion
to the portion of the Performance Period during which the Participant was not an
employee. If a Participant ceases employment with the Company for any of the
reasons specified in this paragraph, after the completion of any Performance
Period (but before the payment of the Remaining Long-Term Cash Award Payment
related to the completed Performance Period), then his rights to any Long-Term
Cash Award Earned and to such Award Payment related to the completed Performance
Period shall thereupon vest, and he shall be entitled to receive such Award
Payment at the time he would have otherwise received the Payment.

If a Participant ceases employment with the Company for any reason other than
those indicated in the previous two paragraphs (including by reason of
involuntary termination not for cause, except as provided above with respect to
involuntary termination after a Change in Control of the Company, or transfer of
employment to a buyer of any business unit of the Company), then his rights in
any Incomplete Long-Term Cash Award, and any Award Payment that is unpaid as of
the date the Participant ceases

<PAGE>

                                      -7-

such employment, shall be determined by the Committee (or the designee of the
Committee, which may include the Chief Executive Officer of the Company) as soon
as practicable after the Participant ceases such employment. All such
determinations shall be final and binding on all parties.

Except as modified by the provisions of the second and third paragraphs of this
section, payments due to Participants pursuant to the applicable preceding
paragraphs, above, shall be calculated and made in accordance with the
provisions described under the section entitled "Calculation of Long-Term Cash
Awards Earned: Form of Payment".

A leave of absence, if approved by the Committee, shall not be deemed a
termination or change of employment status for the purposes of this section,
but, unless the Committee otherwise directs, any Long-Term Cash Award Earned
that a Participant would otherwise have received under a Long-Term Cash Award
Program shall be reduced ratably in proportion to the portion of the Performance
Period during which the Participant was on such leave of absence.

Any consent, approval or direction which the Committee may give under this
section in respect of an event or transaction may be given before or after the
event or transaction.


CALCULATION OF LONG-TERM CASH AWARDS EARNED: FORM OF PAYMENT

Long-Term Cash Awards Earned will be paid to a Participant in two installments
(1) the first installment shall be paid in March of the third and final year of
the Performance Period and shall be equal to 50% of what is earned based on the
Company's performance for the first two calendar years of the applicable
Performance Period, but no more than 50% of the Participant's Targeted Award
(the "Interim Long-Term Cash Award Payment"), and (2) the balance, if any, of
the Long-Term Cash Award Earned will be paid in March after the end of the third
and final year of the Performance Period (the "Remaining Long-Term Cash Award
Payment").

The Committee shall determine the extent to which the performance objectives of
a Long-Term Cash Award have been achieved during the Performance Period and the
amount of any Long-Term Cash Awards Earned (and the amount of any Award
Payment). All calculations in this regard shall be made in accordance with the
generally accepted accounting principles customarily applied by the Company and
shall be submitted to the Committee for its review and approval. The
determination of the Committee shall be final and binding.

                                      -8-

GENERAL

Nothing in this document nor in any instrument executed pursuant hereto shall
confer upon a Participant any right to continue in the employ of the Company or
a Subsidiary, or shall affect the right of the Company or a Subsidiary to
terminate his or her employment with or without cause.

The Company or a Subsidiary may make such provisions as it may deem appropriate
for the withholding or any taxes that the Company or a Subsidiary determines it
is required to withhold in connection with any Long-Term Cash Award Earned.

Nothing in a Long-Term Cash Award is intended to be a substitute for, or shall
preclude or limit the establishment or continuation of, any other plan,
practice, or arrangement for the payment of compensation or benefits to
employees generally, or to any class or group of employees, which the Company or
a Subsidiary now has or may hereafter lawfully put into effect, including,
without limitation, any retirement, pension, group insurance, annual bonus,
stock purchase, stock bonus or stock option plan; provided, however, that no
amounts awarded or paid pursuant to any Long-Term Cash Award shall be included
or counted as compensation for the purposes of any employee benefit plan of the
Company or a Subsidiary where contributions to the plan, or the benefits
received from the plan, are measured or determined in whole or in part, by the
amount of the employee's compensation.

The grant of a Long-Term Cash Award to an employee of a Subsidiary shall be
contingent on the approval of the Long-Term Cash Award by the Subsidiary and the
Subsidiary's agreement that (i) the Company may administer such Award on its
behalf and (ii) the Subsidiary will make, or reimburse the Company for, the
payments called for by the Long-Term Cash Award. The provisions of this
paragraph and the obligations of the Subsidiary so undertaken may be waived, in
whole or in the part, from time to time by the Company.


AMENDMENTS AND DISCONTINUANCE

In the event acquisitions, divestments, substantial changes in tax or other laws
or in accounting principles or practices, natural disasters or other
extraordinary events render fulfillment of the performance objectives of a
Long-Term Cash Award impossible or impracticable, or result in the achievement
of the performance objectives without appreciable effort by the Participant, the
Committee may, but shall not be obligated to, amend any such Long-Term Cash
Award in any appropriate manner so that the Participant may earn Long-Term Cash
Awards comparable to those that might have been earned if the extraordinary
event had not occurred.

The Chief Executive Officer of the Company may approve such technical changes
and clarifications to the Long-Term Cash Award Program as necessary, provided
such changes or clarifications do not vary substantially from the terms and
conditions outlined in this description.

<PAGE>

                                      -9-

In the event a Change in Control of the Company (as defined herein) shall occur
or the Board of Directors has reason to believe that a Change of Control may
occur, the Committee may, with respect to any one or more Long-Term Cash Awards,
(i) reduce the length of a Performance Period to not less than one year, (ii)
make ratable adjustments to performance objectives and Targeted Awards, (iii)
change the methods of measuring the performance objectives, (iv) accelerate the
payment of any Long-Term Cash Awards Earned or any Award Payment, and (v) take
other action deemed by it to be appropriate and in the best interests of the
Company under the circumstances. For the purposes of this paragraph:

(A)  "Change in Control of the Company" means and shall be deemed to have
     occurred if (a) the Company determines that any "person" (as such term is
     used in Section 13(d) and 14 (d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934),
     other than a trustee or other fiduciary holding securities under an
     employee benefit plan of the Company or a corporation owned, directly or
     indirectly, by the stockholders of the Company in substantially the same
     proportions as their ownership of stock of the Company, has become the
     "beneficial owner" (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under such Act), directly or
     indirectly, of 20% or more of the outstanding common stock of the Company
     (provided, however, that a Change in Control shall not be deemed to have
     occurred if such person has become the beneficial owner of 20% or more of
     the outstanding Common Stock as the results of a sale of Common Stock by
     the Company that has been approved by the Board of Directors); or pursuant
     to a plan of reorganization which has been confirmed by the U.S. District
     Court or Bankruptcy Court having jurisdiction of the Company's Chapter 11
     case, Case No. 01-01139 (JJF), pursuant to an order of such Court which is
     final and nonappealable, and becomes effective); (ii) individuals who are
     Continuing Directors cease to constitute a majority of any class of
     directors of the Board; (iii) there occurs a reorganization, merger,
     consolidation or other corporate transaction involving the Company (a
     "Corporate Transaction"), in each case, with respect to which the
     stockholders of the Company immediately prior to such Corporate Transaction
     do not, immediately after the Corporate Transaction, own 50% or more of the
     combined voting power of the corporation resulting from such Corporate
     Transaction, provided that this clause (iii) shall not apply to a Corporate
     Transaction which is pursuant to section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code, or is
     pursuant to a plan of reorganization which has been confirmed by the U.S.
     District Court or Bankruptcy Court having jurisdiction of the Company's
     chapter 11 case, Case No. 01-01139 (JJF), pursuant to an order of such
     Court which is final and nonappealable, and becomes effective, or (iv) the
     shareholders of the Company approve a complete liquidation or dissolution
     of the Company.

(B)  "Continuing Director" means any member of the Board of Directors who was
     such a member on the date on which this Program was approved by the Board
     of Directors, and any successor to a Continuing Director who is approved as
     a nominee or elected to succeed to a Continuing Director by a majority of
     Continuing Directors who are then members of the Board of Directors.

The granting of Long-Term Cash Awards may be amended or discontinued by the
Committee at any time.

<PAGE>

                                      -10-

No amendment or discontinuance of Long-Term Cash Awards shall, without a
Participant's consent, adversely affect his rights in any Long-Term Cash Awards
theretofore granted to him, except that, if the Committee so directs, all
Incomplete Long-Term Cash Awards may be terminated prospectively with the same
effect as a termination of employment under the second paragraph of the section
entitled "Termination or Change in Employment Status".
