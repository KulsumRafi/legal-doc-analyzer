director compensation hereunder may be made at any time prior to such compensation being earned (and in the case of quarterly fees, prior to the start of the quarter in which the fees are to be earned) and (B) the timing (which timing may not
accelerate a distribution date) or amount of payments from any Account shall only be effective if made at least six months prior to the payout and in the calendar year prior to the calendar year payout is to occur. </FONT></P><P
