Path 1 Network Technologies Inc. and Internet Photonics, Inc.
Product Development Agreement
Confidential

                        CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED

                                  Exhibit ____

                               RESELLER AGREEMENT

         THIS  RESELLER  AGREEMENT  ("Agreement")  is made  and  effective  this
October 11, 2002,  by and between Path 1 Network  Technologies  Inc., a Delaware
corporation  ("Path 1") and Internet  Photonics,  Inc.,  a Delaware  corporation
("IPI").

         Path 1 has developed  certain  products,  which it markets  directly to
end-users and also markets through  intermediaries such as IPI. Path 1 also OEMs
products for other intermediaries which are excluded from this agreement.

         IPI has developed certain communications equipment, which it markets to
end-users through its direct sales force and through intermediaries.

         IPI desires to license  certain of Path 1's products as  identified  in
Appendix A (the "Products")  attached hereto,  add value to same through its own
products,  co-brand and remarket the value-added products,  all pursuant to this
Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, it is agreed:


1        NONEXCLUSIVE APPOINTMENT

      IPI  is  hereby  appointed  a  nonexclusive  value-added  reseller  of the
      Products  listed  in  Appendix  A, in the  cable  television  market  (the
      "Market"),  for the term of this Agreement.  IPI accepts such  appointment
      and agrees to serve as a reseller of the Products as provided herein.  For
      all purposes of this Agreement,  "customers"  and "end-users"  shall refer
      interchangeably  both to customers  and  end-users  that acquire  products
      directly  from IPI, and to end-users  that acquire  Products from entities
      that  originally  acquired such  Products from IPI. This  Agreement is not
      exclusive  to IPI,  and Path 1 reserves  the  unrestricted  right to sell,
      license,  market and  distribute  or to grant to others the right to sell,
      license,  market and  distribute  the  Products  and value added  versions
      thereof  anywhere  in the  world,  except  as  otherwise  provided  in the
      Development and Supply  Agreement  between Path 1 and IPI, dated September
      9, 2002 (the "Development  Agreement").  Path 1 also reserves the right to
      enter  into  future  agreements  which  may  include  exclusive  terms and
      conditions.

      In  the  event  that  Path  1   receives  a  bona  fide  offer   involving
      non-exclusive  territories,  or markets,  within the Term of this Reseller
      Agreement  from another  party for a set minimum sales level in return for
      an exclusive territory,  or market, IPI will have a first right of refusal
      to match said bona fide offer within

          ***    days of written notification.

      Not withstanding the above,  Internet Photonics will retain  non-exclusive
      rights to North  America  for the Term of this  Agreement.  For  non-North
      American  territories,  should Path 1 enter into any exclusive  agreement,
      Internet  Photonics will have the right of continuation of supply,  during
      the Term of this Agreement for:

a.)       Customers,  including named accounts,  to whom Internet  Photonics has
          tendered a response to an FRP or RFQ,  submitted  standard quotes,  or
          other existing contractual  commitments,  which Internet Photonics has
          undertaken  prior  to  Path 1  entering  into  an  exclusive  Reseller
          Agreement for products or;

b.)       Current  customers,  with existing cable networks,  who wish to expand
          those networks.

c.)       Named account  includes,  but is not limited to,  Liberty  Properties.
          Additional  named  accounts  will  be at  the  mutual  consent  of the
          parties.

2        CO-BRANDING
2.1      PATH 1'S MARKS

2.1.1    NONEXCLUSIVE RIGHT TO USE

                      Path 1 hereby grants to IPI a limited,  nonexclusive right
                      to use Path 1's regular tradenames, trademarks, titles and
                      logos (the "Licensed Marks") in the advertising, promotion
                      and sale of the  Products.  IPI  shall  not make or permit
                      alteration  or removal  of tags,  labels,  or  identifying
                      marks placed by Path 1 on or within any product.  IPI will
                      not use Path 1's  tradenames  or  abbreviations  (with the
                      exception of a logo or mark or graphic design  provided by
                      Path 1 which  indicates IPI is an  authorized  reseller of
                      Path 1) in IPI's  corporate  title or name,  or in any way
                      that might result in confusion as to separate and distinct
                      identities  of Path 1 and  IPI.  Upon  the  expiration  or
                      earlier termination of this Agreement, the license granted
                      to IPI in the  Licensed  Marks  shall  immediately  cease;
                      provided  that IPI shall not be  obligated  to remove  any
                      Licensed  Marks to the  extent the same  already  exist on
                      Products (i) sold to existing  end-users and (ii) in IPI's
                      possession  pending sale or distribution to end-users (the
                      end-users  described  in clauses (i) and (ii) are referred
                      to collectively as the "Installed User Base").

2.1.2    GOODWILL

                      IPI  recognizes  and  acknowledges  Path 1's ownership and
                      title  to the  Licensed  Marks  and the  goodwill  related
                      thereto  and  agrees  that any  goodwill  relating  to the
                      Licensed  Marks that accrues  because of IPI's use of such
                      marks  shall  become the  property  of Path 1. IPI further
                      agrees not to contest or take any action in  opposition to
                      any  trademark,  servicemark,  tradename or logo of Path 1
                      that is used on the Products, or to use, employ or attempt
                      to register any mark or tradename  which is similar to any
                      mark or name owned by Path 1 that is used on the Products.

2.1.3    COPYRIGHTS

                      IPI shall not remove any of Path 1's copyright  notices on
the Products.

2.2      IPI'S MARKS

                      Path  1  shall  have  no  right  to  use  the  tradenames,
trademarks, titles or logos of IPI.


<PAGE>



3        PRICES

      Prices and other terms, if any, for the Products are set forth on Appendix
      A. The  parties  will  meet on a  quarterly  basis  to make any  necessary
      amendments to Appendix A to yield pricing for each Product that results in
      *** (defined  for  purposes  hereof as Path 1's (i) *** plus (ii) *** plus
      (iii) ***.

      During  the Term of this  Agreement  (and  irrespective  of the prices set
      forth on Appendix A), the prices  offered,  at any volume level, by Path 1
      to IPI for the Products  shall be no less  favorable  than most  favorable
      prices  offered  by Path 1 to any other  customer  at like  volume  levels
      (treating  for  this  purpose  IPI  and  all of its  customers  purchasing
      Products as a single  customer,  and after  deducting  such portion of the
      price as is representative of IPI's share of revenue)  purchasing  similar
      quantities of similar products on reasonably comparable terms. In any such
      case, to the extent the prices  reflected on Appendix A are less favorable
      than the  prices to  another  similarly  situated  customer,  Path 1 shall
      promptly  so notify IPI and IPI shall be  entitled  to the more  favorable
      pricing (it being  understood  that the failure of Path 1 to so notify IPI
      shall not affect IPI's right to obtain the more favorable pricing).

4        PRODUCT CHANGES AND ADDITIONS

      During the Term of this Agreement,  Path 1 has the right to modify,  alter
      or discontinue the Products at any time, at its  discretion,  following at
      least ninety (90) days' prior written notice to IPI.  Notwithstanding  the
      foregoing,  if IPI  notifies  Path  1 that  IPI's  customers  require  the
      original Products that Path 1 proposes to so modify, alter or discontinue,
      Path 1 will in good faith work with IPI to  continue to supply the version
      of the Product requested by such customers.  Any new versions of Products,
      as  defined  in  Appendix  A of this  Agreement  must  either (i) be fully
      interoperable with the Products comprising the Installed User Base or (ii)
      become  interoperable with the Products comprising the Installed User Base
      by means of a remote  upgrade to the  Installed  User Base,  which  remote
      upgrade will be made  available to IPI and the  Installed  User Base at no
      cost.

From time to time,  Path 1 or IPI may  propose  that one or more  upgrades to or
additional  Path 1 products be made available for resale by IPI. IPI understands
that  Path 1 may  offer IPI  future  products,  defined  in  Appendix  A of this
Agreement,  which may not be  interoperable  with those listed in Appendix A. In
any such case, the parties shall in good faith  consider the proposed  addition.
If the  parties  agree as to the  inclusion  of such  products  and the  pricing
therefor,  such products  shall be added to Appendix A (which shall be initialed
by  representatives  of each party to evidence  their assent to such  addition),
with any interoperability issues identified,  and shall be treated as "Products"
for all purposes hereunder.

5        ORDERS
5.1      PRODUCT ORDERING

             Purchases of Product  pursuant to this  Agreement  shall be made by
             IPI using IPI's regular  purchase  order form;  provided,  however,
             that  additional,  modified or conflicting  terms and conditions on
             IPI's  purchase order form or any Path 1 order  confirmation  shall
             not modify or amend this Agreement  unless  expressly  agreed to in
             writing signed by both parties. For avoidance of doubt, performance
             by either side of its obligations  following  receipt of a purchase
             order or  confirmation  that  purports  to  modify  or  amend  this
             Agreement shall not be deemed to constitute acceptance of the terms
             set forth on such purchase order or confirmation.

             All orders must  specify  the Product or Products to be  purchased;
             the appropriate  purchase  price;  the requested ship date; and, if
             applicable, state the appropriate tax exemption certificate number.

             All purchase  orders and  amendments  thereto must  reference  this
             Agreement and are subject to acceptance by Path 1, which acceptance
             shall be delivered within 48 hours after receipt.

5.2      SHIPMENT

             Path 1 will use its best efforts to delivered all ordered  Products
             within  ***  days  after  receipt  of a  purchase  order  therefor.
             Shipment of the Products  purchased by IPI hereunder  shall be made
             F.O.B.  Path 1's  facilities or such other location or locations as
             Path 1 may from time to time designate in writing.  If agreed to in
             advance by IPI's customers,  Path 1 may make partial shipments, and
             each shipment shall be deemed a separate order and payment therefor
             shall become due in  accordance  with the terms  hereof.  IPI shall
             take the license to the Products at the F.O.B.  point and all risks
             of  loss  and  expenses  in  connection  with  the  Products  shall
             thereafter be the  responsibility of IPI; provided,  however,  that
             Path 1 retains all applicable  rights to the intellectual  property
             contained in the Products (as herein set forth).

             Path 1 will hold in parts  inventory the parts  required to deliver
             within *** days *** units of *** series  Products.  Should the cost
             of  maintaining  an  inventory  of  so-called  long lead time parts
             required to comply  with such *** day  delivery  obligation  exceed
             ***% of the  total  parts  cost of the  Products,  then  IPI  shall
             reasonably  co-operate with Path 1 to share the cost of maintaining
             such inventory of long lead time parts.  If such  inventory  levels
             for the ***  Products  should  fall  below ***  units (or  should a
             comparable  reduction in inventory occur for any other Products) as
             a result  of  unanticipated  orders,  Path 1 will use  commercially
             reasonable efforts to make up the shortfall as soon as possible.

5.3      ACCEPTANCE

             Products ordered hereunder will be deemed accepted by IPI following
             satisfactory  testing as provided in the  following  sentence.  IPI
             shall  have  ***  days  after  receipt  of the  Products  at  IPI's
             facilities  (the "Test  Period"),  but prior to  reshipment  of the
             Products to IPI's customers,  to inspect and test the Products.  If
             IPI discovers any defect in a Product and reports such defect in or
             within the Test Period, Path 1 will, at its option,  either repair,
             replace  or accept  return  of the  Product  or credit  IPI for the
             applicable  purchase  price.  The  foregoing is in addition to, and
             does not limit, the warranty  obligations of Path 1 as set forth in
             Section 10.

5.4      PAYMENT

             Payment  shall be made by IPI  within *** (***) days after the date
             of Path 1's invoice.  IPI shall be responsible to pay, or reimburse
             Path 1, as appropriate,  for any sales,  use, excise or similar tax
             levied on the transactions  hereunder, or any personal property tax
             attributable to the license granted IPI herein.

5.5      CHANGES AND CANCELLATIONS

             IPI may  reschedule  each  purchase  order one time for a  shipment
             within *** days of the original ship date if IPI so notifies Path 1
             at least *** days in advance of the originally scheduled ship date.
             IPI may  cancel  an  order  prior to  shipment  upon  payment  of a
             cancellation  fee  equal to ***  (***%)  of the  order  subject  to
             cancellation,  and  provided  that  Path 1  receives  notice of the
             cancellation  not more than (***) days prior to the scheduled  ship
             date.   Cancellation   of  any   order   after  the  last  day  for
             cancellation,  or in the event that Path 1 has already  shipped the
             Product,  shall require IPI to pay *** (***%) of the purchase price
             of the order subject to cancellation.  The parties agree that these
             charges are a reasonable  method for determining  Path 1's expenses
             and  damages  arising  out of  cancellation  or  refusal  to accept
             shipment.

             Path 1 will exert reasonable efforts to either modify and resell to
             others  finished  products or return unused parts to its suppliers.
             Path 1 will reduce IPI's obligations stated above accordingly.

5.6      PERFORMANCE

             The  Parties  agree that there shall be an  expectation  of minimum
             acceptable  performance  during the term of this  Agreement  as set
             forth in Section 13 Term and Termination

6        LICENSE

During  the Term of this  Agreement,  Path 1 grants  and IPI  accepts a limited,
nonexclusive,  non-transferable  (except as provided in Section 21),  fully paid
and royalty free license to distribute  the Products  directly and indirectly to
customers  and  end-users,  and to use,  maintain  and test the Products for the
purposes of carrying out its  obligations  (including  its support  obligations)
hereunder. The license granted herein shall permit IPI to combine or include the
Products  with IPI's other  products for the purpose of adding to or  increasing
the  value,  functionality  or  utility  of such  products  for  IPI's  end-user
customers.

7        UPDATES AND IMPROVEMENTS

      From time to time, Path 1 may release improvements, modifications or other
      alterations of its Products. For purposes hereof, "Updates" means releases
      that  correct  errors  or  bugs,  or  that  offer  minor  improvements  in
      functionality  or performance  that,  taken as a whole,  do not materially
      affect the overall value of the Product.  "Upgrades"  means  releases with
      significant  improvements in functionality or performance that, taken as a
      whole,  materially affect the overall value of the Product.  Any Update or
      Upgrade that relates to any Product shall be provided to IPI promptly upon
      its general release by Path 1. All Products thereafter sold will be deemed
      to automatically  include any Updates thereto,  without charge. Path 1 may
      charge an  additional  sum for any Upgrades  (subject to the "most favored
      nation" pricing provisions of Section 3, treating for this purpose IPI and
      all of its customers  purchasing Products as a single customer),  it being
      understood  that IPI and its  customers  are free to elect not to purchase
      any Upgrade. Path 1 will also provide IPI with such copies or parts as may
      be required to provide Updates and Upgrades to the Installed User Base.

      From  time to time IPI may  request  that Path 1  improve  or  modify  the
      Products.  Path 1  agrees  that it will in good  faith  consider  any such
      requests.  Without  limiting  the  generality  of  the  foregoing,  if IPI
      discovers  an  error  in the  operation  of any  Product,  Path 1 will use
      commercially  reasonable  efforts to remedy the same and rectify the error
      by means of a Update.

8        CONFIDENTIALITY

      In the  performance  of this  Agreement,  each  party  may have  access to
      confidential, proprietary or trade secret information owned or provided by
      the other party  relating to  software,  computer  programs,  object code,
      source code,  marketing  plans,  business  plans,  financial  information,
      specifications,  flow charts and other data ("Confidential  Information").
      All Confidential  Information supplied by one party to another pursuant to
      this  Agreement  shall  remain the  exclusive  property of the  disclosing
      party.  The receiving party shall use such  Confidential  Information only
      for the purposes of this Agreement and shall not copy, disclose, convey or
      transfer any of the  Confidential  Information  or any part thereof to any
      third  party.  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  IPI  may  sublicense  the
      Products as set forth in this  Agreement and IPI may disclose the terms of
      this  Agreement  to  current  or  prospective   investors,   customers  or
      acquirors;  provided,  however  that such party shall have  undertaken  to
      preserve the confidentiality of the terms hereof. Neither party shall have
      any obligation with respect to Confidential  Information  which: (i) is or
      becomes  generally known to the public by any means other than a breach of
      the obligations of a receiving  party;  (ii) was previously known to the a
      receiving  party or rightly  received  by a  receiving  party from a third
      party; (iii) is independently developed by the receiving party; or (iv) is

      accordance  with  the  regulation  of the SEC or any  national  securities
      exchange.  The  provisions of this Section 8 shall survive  termination of
      this Agreement.

             manufacturing  defects or interaction between the Product and other
             materials, and that cannot be resolved by the End User.

             During the first *** (***) months following shipment,  this Support
             will be provided for all Products shipped to IPI. Subsequent to the
             initial *** (***) month  period  following  shipment,  Path 1 shall
             provide  End User  Support  based  on an  annual  support  fee of a

             maintenance  agreement.  The fee  will  be  invoiced  quarterly  in
             advance effective Jan 1, 2003.

             During  the  first  ***  months  following  shipment,  in the event
             on-site support is required to resolve  Customer  problems,  Path 1
             shall  bear its  costs of  travel  and  related  expenses  and such
             on-site  service  shall be at no  additional  charge,  unless it is
             determined  that  Path 1  products  were  not  responsible  for the
             problem. In this circumstance, the customer will be responsible for
             all  Path  1's   reasonable   travel  and  related   expenses   and
             professional time.

             After the *** warranty,  subject to an Extended Warranty Agreement,
             in the event  on-site  support  is  required  to  resolve  Customer
             problems,  Path 1 shall  bear  its  costs  of  travel  and  related
             expenses and such on-site service shall be at no additional charge,

             responsible for all Path 1's reasonable travel and related expenses

             Customer  shall bear Path 1's costs of travel and related  expenses

      defend against such claim. Path 1 shall be permitted,  with counsel of its
      choice,  to  defend  any  such  suits.  IPI  will  provide,  and  will use
