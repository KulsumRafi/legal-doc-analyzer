Borrower and each Account Party hereby represents and warrants on behalf of
itself and its respective Subsidiaries that (i) the representations and
warranties of Holdings contained in Section 2 of the Holdings Guaranty are true
and correct in all material respects on and as of the Waiver Effective Date (as

limited by their terms to a specific date, which shall be true and correct in
all material respects as of such date), and (ii) there exists no Default or
Event of Default under the Credit Agreement on the Waiver Effective Date, after
giving effect to this Waiver.

      2. This Waiver is limited as specified and shall not constitute an
amendment, modification, acceptance or waiver of any other provision of the
Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document.

effect after the Waiver Termination Date.

      6. Holdings, the Borrower and each Account Party acknowledge and agree
that the execution and delivery by the Administrative Agent and the Banks of

or otherwise obligate the Administrative Agent or the Banks to forebear or
execute similar waivers, amendments or agreements under the same or similar
circumstances in the future, or (ii) to modify, relinquish or impair any right
of the Administrative Agent or the Banks to receive any indemnity or similar

the exercise of any other right, power or remedy. Other than as set forth in
this Waiver, nothing contained in this Waiver or in any prior communications
