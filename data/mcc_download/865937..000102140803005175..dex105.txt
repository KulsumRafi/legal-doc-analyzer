                       FOURTH AMENDMENT TO LOAN AGREEMENT

     THIS FOURTH AMENDMENT TO LOAN AGREEMENT (this "Amendment"), dated as of
December 23, 2002, is entered into by and among:

          (1)  CATELLUS FINANCE 1, L.L.C., a Delaware limited liability company
     ("Borrower");

          (2)  LASALLE BANK NATIONAL ASSOCIATION, f/k/a LaSalle National Bank,
     as trustee for the registered Holders of Prudential Mortgage Capital
     Company I, LLC, Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series
     1998-1 ("Lender");

          (3)  Each of the certificateholders listed in Schedule I attached
     hereto (collectively, the "Certificateholders") comprising all of the
     holders of Certificates as defined in that certain Trust and Servicing
     Agreement dated as of November 11, 1998, by and among Prudential Mortgage
     Capital Company I, LLC, as Depositor, The Prudential Insurance Company of
     America, as Servicer, ABN AMRO Bank N.V., as Fiscal Agent, and LaSalle
     National Bank, as Trustee (the "Trust and Servicing Agreement"); and

          (4)  THE PRUDENTIAL INSURANCE COMPANY OF AMERICA, as servicer under
     the Trust and Servicing Agreement (in such capacity, "Servicer").

                                    RECITALS

     A.   Reference is made to that certain loan agreement dated as of October
26, 1998 (the "Original Loan Agreement") between Borrower and Prudential
Mortgage Capital Company, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Prudential"),
predecessor-in-interest to Lender, as amended by that certain First Amendment to
Loan Agreement dated as of January 11, 2001, by and among Borrower, Lender, the
Certificateholders, and Servicer (the "First Amendment") and that certain Second
Amendment to Loan Agreement dated as of February 8, 2001 (the "Second
Amendment"), that certain Second [sic] Amendment to Loan Agreement dated as of
August 27, 2002 (the "Third Amendment") (the Original Loan Agreement as amended
by the First Amendment, the Second Amendment and the Third Amendment and the
same may hereinafter be consolidated, extended, modified, amended and/or
restated or renewed from time to time, collectively, the "Loan Agreement").
Pursuant to the terms of the Original Loan Agreement, Prudential agreed to
extend a loan (the "Loan"), evidenced by that certain promissory note dated
October 26, 1998, in the original principal amount of THREE HUNDRED
SEVENTY-THREE MILLION AND 00/100 DOLLARS ($373,000,000.00).

     B.   Prudential assigned all of its right, title and interest under the
Loan to Prudential Mortgage Capital Company I, LLC, which in turn assigned all
of its right, title and interest under the Loan to Lender in accordance with the
terms and provisions of the Trust and Servicing Agreement.

     C.   In connection with the closing of the Loan, Borrower pledged to
Prudential as collateral for the Loan, among other things, that certain real
property comprising a portion of the

<PAGE>

Property Pool identified as OK1090404, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma in Exhibit A to
the Loan Agreement (the "Oklahoma Property"); which property is more
specifically described on Exhibit A attached hereto.

     D.   Borrower has requested Lender, the Certificateholders and the Servicer
to amend the Loan Agreement to permit Borrower to substitute a property in place
of the Oklahoma Property on terms other than those contained in the Loan
Agreement and in connection therewith to release the Oklahoma Property from the
lien of the Loan Documents, including the applicable mortgage, assignment of
leases and rents and UCC-1 financing statements.

     E.   Lender, the Certificateholders, and the Servicer are willing so to
amend the Loan Agreement and release the Oklahoma Property from the lien of the
Loan Documents upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein.

     F.   Borrower, Lender, the Certificateholders, and the Servicer also desire
to amend the Third Amendment to correct a scrivener's error made with respect to
the Third Amendment whereby despite the existence of a Second Amendment to the
Loan Agreement, the Third Amendment to the Loan Agreement was also titled
"Second Amendment to Loan Agreement".

                                    AGREEMENT

     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the above recitals and for other good
and valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby
acknowledged, Borrower, Lender, the Certificateholders and the Servicer hereby
agree as follows:

     1.   Definitions, Interpretation. All capitalized terms defined above and
elsewhere in this Amendment shall be used herein as so defined. Unless otherwise
defined herein, all other capitalized terms used herein shall have the
respective meanings given to those terms in the Loan Agreement, as amended by
this Amendment.

     2.   Amendments to Third Amendment. The Third Amendment is hereby amended
as follows: (i) the title of the Third Amendment shall be "Third Amendment to
Loan Agreement" and all references to "Second" within the Third Amendment shall
be amended to "Third"; and (ii) the definition of Original Loan Agreement
contained in the Third Amendment shall be modified to include a reference to the
Second Amendment.

     3.   Deliveries and Amendment to Loan Agreement

          (a) Subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in
     Paragraph 6 below, the following shall occur on the Effective Date (as

     Borrower (1) a Release of Mortgage, Assignment of Leases and Rents,
     Security Agreement and Fixture Filing in the form of Exhibit B hereto with
     respect to the Oklahoma Property, duly executed by Lender and appropriately
     notarized; (2) a Release of Assignment of Leases and Rents in the form of

     executed by Lender and appropriately notarized; and (3) a termination of
     UCC Financing Statement in the form of Exhibit D attached hereto relating
     to the Oklahoma Property, duly executed by Lender.

                (ii) Exhibit A and Schedule 1 of the Loan Agreement shall be
     amended by deleting therefrom the Oklahoma Property.

          (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the release of the Oklahoma
     Property shall not constitute a release of Borrower's indemnification
     obligations under the Loan Agreement or under the other Loan Documents as
     to any matters or claims which occurred or relate to any matters or claims
     which occurred on or before the Effective Date with respect to the Oklahoma
     Property and such obligations shall survive the release of the Oklahoma
     Property from the Property Pool.

     4.   Representations and Warranties of Borrower. Borrower hereby represents
and warrants to Lender, the Certificateholders and Servicer that the following
are true and correct on the date of this Amendment and that, after giving effect
to the amendment set forth in Paragraphs 2 and 3 above, the following will be
true and correct on the Effective Date:

          (a)  The representations and warranties of Borrower set forth in
     Article V of the Loan Agreement and in the other Loan Documents are true

     shall be true as of such date);

          (b)  No Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing;

          (c)  All of the Loan Documents are in full force and effect;

     of all the Properties currently securing the Loan as of the date hereof has
     not materially and adversely changed from the fair market values as of the
     Closing Date; and

          (e)  The current value of the Oklahoma Property as of the date hereof
     is not more than $3,400,000.00 per an appraisal dated November 26, 2002.

(Without limiting the scope of the term "Loan Documents," Borrower expressly
acknowledges in making the representations and warranties set forth in this
Paragraph 4 that, on and after the date hereof, such term includes this
Amendment.)

          (a)  To Servicer's knowledge, the outstanding principal balance of the
     Loan as of December 5, 2002 is Three Hundred Fifty-Two Million Nine Hundred
     Forty-Six Thousand Five Hundred Thirty-One and 77/100 dollars
     ($352,946,531.77);

<PAGE>

          (b)  Servicer is not receiving any loan payments or fees from Borrower
     in connection with the release of the Oklahoma Property and this Amendment
     other than for amounts intended to reimburse Servicer for costs and
     expenses in handling the transaction; and

          (c)  The release of the Oklahoma Property will not change the
     Servicer's payment expectations with respect to the Loan.

     6.   Effective Date. The amendments effected by Paragraph 3 above shall
become effective (the "Effective Date") upon satisfaction and receipt by Lender,
the Certificateholders and Servicer of the following matters, each in form and
substance satisfactory to Lender, the Certificateholders and Servicer:

          (a)  This Amendment duly executed by Borrower, Lender, the
     Certificateholders and Servicer;

          (b)  The Agreement of Catellus Development Corporation and Plato REIT,

     conflict with or violate any applicable laws, agreements or restrictions;
     and

               (v)    such other matters incident to this Amendment as Lender

<PAGE>

     Lower-Tier REMIC or the Upper Tier REMIC (as such terms are defined in the

     established by Lender and under the exclusive control of Lender, and at
     Lender's election, Servicer (the "Interim Cash Reserve Deposit Account"),
     an amount equal to the Interim Cash Reserve Deposit. All amounts held in
     the Interim Cash Reserve Deposit Account shall accrue interest for the
     benefit of Borrower, at the customary rate of interest earned by Lender (or
     Servicer) on short term funds and all such interest shall be added to and
     become a part of the Interim Cash Reserve Deposit. Borrower shall pay to
     Lender (or its Servicer) the administrative costs associated with
     investing, administering or otherwise providing for interest on the amounts
     so deposited. The Interim Cash Reserve Deposit shall be applied in
     accordance with the provisions of subparagraphs (b) and (e) of this
     Paragraph 7, as applicable.

          (b)  The Interim Cash Reserve Deposit shall be refunded to Borrower

     or Partial Defeasance Deadline"):

               (i)  Borrower provides to Lender one or more Substitute
          Properties in place of the Oklahoma Property as if the Oklahoma
          Property constituted the Replaced Property for which such one or more
          Substitute Properties is being replaced and satisfies all of the
          conditions and requirements set forth in Section 2.12 of the Loan
          Agreement relating to a Substitution (including all conditions
          incorporated by reference in such Section) involving such Substitute
          Properties, subject to the following:

                    (A) for the purpose of Section 2.12(a), the Substitute
          Property or Substitute Properties must have an aggregate NOI of not
          less than $418,716.00; and

                                        5

<PAGE>

                    (B) for the purpose of Section 2.12(b), the Substitute
          Property or Substitute Properties must have an aggregate FMV of not
          less than $4,000,000.00;

          or

               (ii) Borrower pays to Lender a Defeasance Deposit sufficient to
          enable Lender to purchase the Defeasance Collateral for the Partial
          Defeasance of the Oklahoma Property and covenants to comply with all
          of the conditions and requirements set forth in Section 1.03 of the
          Note relating to a Partial Defeasance, subject to the following:

                    (A) for the purpose of Section 1.03 of the Note, the
          Defeasance Date (as defined in the Note) shall be the Payment Date
          that occurs immediately after the Oklahoma Property Substitution or
          Partial Defeasance Deadline and it shall not be necessary for Borrower
          to give to Lender prior written notice of such date;

                    (B) for the purpose of Section 1.03(a)(3) of the Note, the
          amount of the Defeased Note and the principal amount of the Loan to be
          defeased shall be $3,555,466.50.

          (c)  Borrower's failure to either provide to Lender a Substitute
     Property or Substitute Properties pursuant to Paragraph 7(b)(i) above or
     the Defeasance Deposit pursuant to Paragraph 7(b)(ii) above on or before
     the Oklahoma Property Substitution or Partial Defeasance Deadline shall
     constitute an Event of Default under the Loan Agreement.

          (d)  No Property (other than the Oklahoma Property, to the extent not
     already released) shall be released from the lien of the applicable
     Mortgage or the other Loan Documents under this Amendment.

          (e)  Borrower hereby unconditionally and irrevocably assigns, conveys,
     pledges, mortgages, transfers, delivers, deposits, sets over and confirms
     unto Lender, and hereby grants to Lender a security interest in, (i) the
     Interim Cash Reserve Deposit, (ii) the Interim Cash Reserve Deposit Account
     or any other account into which the Interim Cash Reserve Deposit will be
     deposited, (iii) all accounts, contract rights and general intangibles or
     other rights and interests pertaining thereto, (iv) all sums now or
     hereafter therein or represented thereby, (v) all replacements,
     substitutions or proceeds thereof, (vi) all instruments and documents now
     or hereafter evidencing the Interim Cash Reserve Deposit or such accounts,
     (vii) all powers, options, rights, privileges and immunities pertaining to
     the Interim Cash Reserve Deposit Account (including the right to make
     withdrawals therefrom), and (viii) all proceeds of the foregoing. Borrower
     hereby authorizes and consents to the account into which the Interim Cash
     Reserve Deposit will be deposited being held in Lender's name or the name
     of any entity servicing the Loan for Lender and hereby acknowledges and
     agrees, that Lender, or at Lender's election, such servicing agent, shall
     have exclusive control over said account. Notice of the assignment and
     security interest granted to Lender herein may be delivered by Lender at

                                        6

<PAGE>

     any time to the financial institution wherein the Interim Cash Reserve
     Deposit Account has been established, and Lender, or such servicing entity,
     shall have possession of all passbooks or other evidences of such accounts.
     Borrower hereby waives all right to withdraw funds from the Interim Cash
     Reserve Deposit Account. If an Event of Default shall occur hereunder or
     under any other of the Loan Documents, then Lender may, without notice or
     demand on Borrower, at its option: (A) withdraw any or all of the funds
     (including, without limitation, interest) then remaining in the Interim
     Cash Reserve Deposit Account and apply the same, after deducting all costs
     and expenses of safekeeping, collection and delivery (including, but not
     limited to, reasonable attorneys' fees, costs and expenses) to pay
     principal, interest and other amounts under the Loan Documents, in such
     order and manner as the Lender may elect in its sole discretion, (B)
     exercise any and all rights and remedies of a secured party under any
     applicable Uniform Commercial Code, and/or (C) exercise any other remedies
     available at law or in equity.

     8.   Effect of this Amendment. Except as specifically amended above, (a)
the Loan Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall remain in full force and
effect and are hereby ratified and affirmed and (b) the execution, delivery and
effectiveness of this Amendment shall not, except as expressly provided herein,
operate as a waiver of any right, power, or remedy of Lender, the
Certificateholders or Servicer, nor constitute a waiver of any provision of the
Loan Agreement or any other Operative Document. The amendments effected by
Paragraph 3 above shall be effective only as to this specific instance with
respect to the Oklahoma Property, and shall not be deemed to be an agreement by
Lender to amend the Loan Documents for any subsequent request by Borrower or for
any similar matter.

     9.   Miscellaneous.

          (a)  Counterparts. This Amendment may be executed in any number of
     identical counterparts, any set of which signed by all the parties hereto
     shall be deemed to constitute a complete, executed original for all
     purposes.

          (b)  Headings. Headings in this Amendment are for convenience of
     reference only and are not part of the substance hereof.

          (c)  Governing Law. This Amendment shall be governed by and construed
     in accordance with the laws of the State of New York without reference to
     conflicts of law rules.

          WHEREAS, CATELLUS FINANCE 1, L.L.C., a Delaware limited liability

          WHEREAS, Borrower has requested Lender, the Certificateholders and the

Documents and from Plato's obligations under the Plato Guaranty and the Plato
Environmental Indemnity in favor of Lender.

          2.   Reaffirmation of Plato Guaranty and Environmental Indemnity.
Plato hereby consents to the Fourth Amendment, reaffirms its obligations under
the Plato Guaranty and the Plato Environmental Indemnity (collectively, the
"Plato Guaranties"), and reaffirms its waiver of each and every one of the
defenses to such obligations as set forth in the Plato Guaranties. Plato

obligations under the Plato Guaranties are separate and distinct from Borrower's
obligations under the Loan Agreement and the other Loan Documents and from
Catellus' obligations under the Catellus Guaranties in favor of Lender.

          3.   Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed
in accordance with the laws of the State of New York without reference to
conflicts of laws rules.
