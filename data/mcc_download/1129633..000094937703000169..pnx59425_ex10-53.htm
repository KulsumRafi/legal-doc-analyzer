     Plan similar to other participants at your level.
4.   An Annual Incentive plan based on predefined goals identified in Exhibit I

This document is intended to define the Annual Incentive Plan component.

<b>Eligibility</b>
This annual incentive plan is exclusively for Michael Gilotti.

<b>Performance Period</b>
January, 2002 to December 31, 2002

<b>Annual Incentive Plan</b>
&#149;   Sales goals as defined in exhibit I will constitute 70% of the incentive component based on 2002
    Annuity results.
&#149;   15% will be based on company performance as measured by ROE for the performance year 2002.
&#149;   15% will be based on expense management with the goal to reduce the company's planned controllable expenses.
&#149;   Actual payment will occur in first quarter 2003.

<b>Employee Benefits</b>
Pension SERP benefits will include the annual incentive payment as defined in this program document as eligible
earnings. All other benefits will use base salary as eligible earnings.

<b>Termination</b>
In order to receive any payments under this plan you must be an active employee in good standing on the annual
incentive payment date.

<b>Death and Disability</b>
If your employment ends as a result of death, disability or retirement, you will receive your annual incentive
as follows: your annual incentive will be calculated by prorating the percentage of target earned according to
the number of months that you were actively at work. If you leave in the middle of the month, you will receive
full credit for that month of service. Any such annual incentive payment will be paid in the first quarter of
the subsequent year.

<b>Right to amend plan</b>
The company specifically reserves the right to change or terminate the program at any time. No adverse changes
will be made retroactively, but will apply subsequently. No incentive payment is deemed to be earned until paid
by the company.

<b>Amendments to Plan Due to Organizational Changes</b>
This Incentive Plan may be amended, if necessary, to reflect changes in your organizational roles and
responsibilities. Recognition for accomplishments up to the point of organizational change will be given and
any changes to the plan will reflect new and/or additional responsibilities. No adverse changes will be made.
