<P>WHEREAS, the parties desire to memorialize their agreement with respect thereto in the manner set forth herein, </P>

</B></FONT><U><LI>Termination Following a Change of Control</U>.  If the Executive's employment with the Company is terminated either (A) by the Company for any reason other than for &quot;Good Cause&quot; (as defined below), or (B) by the Executive for &quot;Good Reason&quot; (as defined below), in each case within twelve months following the occurrence of a &quot;Change of Control&quot; (as defined below), Executive shall be entitled to the following benefits in exchange for a release of claims against the Company and its agents:</LI>
<OL TYPE="a">

<U><LI>Final Paycheck</U>.  Payment, in a lump sum, of any and all base salary due and owing through the date of termination, plus an amount equal to all earned but unused vacation through the date of termination and reimbursement for all reasonable expenses;</LI>
<U><LI>Continued Payment of Salary</U>.  Payment of Executive's then-current base salary for a period of twelve (12) months, less any deductions required by applicable law, payable in accordance with the Company's standard payroll practices;</LI>
<U><LI>Company-paid COBRA</U>.  Company-paid existing group employee benefit coverage continuation under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (&quot;COBRA&quot;) as provided by the Company's group health plans for twelve (12) months starting the next calendar month after termination to the same extent as paid by the Company immediately before the Executive's layoff, or until Executive becomes eligible for group insurance benefits from another employer, whichever occurs first.  Executive shall have an obligation to inform Company if he/she receives group coverage from another employer while receiving COBRA coverage from the Company.  Executive may not increase the number of designated dependants, if any, during this time unless Executive does so at his/her own expense.  The period of such Company-paid COBRA coverage shall be considered part of Executive's COBRA coverage entitlement period, and may, for tax purposes, be considered income to the Executive.</LI></OL>

<U><LI>Timing of Payments</U>.  The payment provided for in Section 1(a) shall be payable immediately upon Executive's termination.  The payment provided for in Section 1(b) shall begin upon Executive's termination or ten (10) days after the Company's receipt of a signed, unrevoked release of claims, whichever is later.  The benefit provided for in Section 1(c) shall begin the next calendar month after termination provided that the Company has received Executive's executed, unrevoked Release.  All such payments will be subject to applicable payroll or other taxes required to be withheld by the Company.</LI>
<LI> <U>Subsequent Employment</U>.  The compensation and benefits payable hereunder shall not be reduced or offset by any amounts that the Executive earns or could earn from any subsequent employment.</LI>
<U><LI>Section 280G Matters</U>.  If the benefits described in Sections 1(b) and (c), in conjunction with any benefits realized under the Stock Option Plan or any other severance plan, practice, policy or agreement (the &quot;Severance Payment&quot;) would otherwise constitute a parachute payment under Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &quot;Code&quot;), then such Severance Payment shall be subject to reduction of the Severance Payment to the extent necessary to assure that the Executive receives only the greater of (i) the amount of such payment which would not constitute such a parachute payment or (ii) the amount which yields the Executive the greatest after-tax amount of benefits after taking into account any excise tax imposed on the Severance Payment (or on any other benefits to which the Executive may be entitled in connection with the Change of Control or the subsequent termination of the Executive's employment status) under Section 4999 of the Code.</LI>
<U><LI>General Release</U>.  All compensation and benefits under Section 1(b) and (c) herein are in consideration for the Executive's execution of a general release of all known and unknown claims that Executive may then have against the Company and its agents, a form of which is available from the Company.  If the Executive does not properly execute such Release, the parties expressly acknowledge and agree that the Executive will not be entitled to any of the benefits provided under Section 1(b) and (c) herein.</LI>
<U><LI>Employment Status</U>.  Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to constitute a contract for employment for any specific period of time.  The parties expressly acknowledge and agree that the undersigned's employment with the Company shall continue to be &quot;at will.&quot;  If, however, the Company exercises its right to terminate Executive's employment without Good Cause, or if Executive exercises Executive's right to terminate employment with the Company for Good Reason, Executive will be entitled to severance as described in Section 1 in exchange for a release of claims against the Company and its agents.</LI>
