                                    THE LOANS

     Section 2.01 Commitments. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions and
relying upon the representations and warranties herein set forth:

             (i) each Revolving A Loan Lender severally agrees to make Revolving
A Loans to the Borrower at any time and from time to time from the Effective
Date to the Final Maturity Date, or until the earlier reduction of its Revolving
A Credit Commitment to zero in accordance with Section 2.05 or Section 9.01, in
an aggregate principal amount of Revolving A Loans at any time outstanding not
to exceed the amount of such Lender's Revolving A Credit Commitment;

             (ii) each Revolving B Loan Lender severally agrees to make
Revolving B Loans to the Borrower at any time and from time to time from the
Effective Date to the Final Maturity Date, or until the earlier reduction of its
Revolving B Credit Commitment to zero in accordance with Section 2.05 or Section
9.01, in an aggregate principal amount of Revolving B Loans at any time
outstanding not to exceed the amount of such Lender's Revolving B Credit
Commitment; and

             (iii) each Term Loan Lender severally agrees to make its portion of
the Term Loan to the Borrower on the Term Loan Funding Date, in an aggregate
principal amount equal to the amount of such Lender's Term Loan Commitment.

     (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing:

             (i) The aggregate principal amount of Revolving Loans outstanding
at any time to the Borrower shall not exceed the lower of (A) the difference
between (x) the Total Revolving Credit Commitment and (y) the aggregate Letter
of Credit Obligations, and (B) the difference between (x) the then current
Borrowing Base and (y) the sum of the aggregate Letter of Credit Obligations and
the outstanding principal amount of the Term Loan.


                                      -35-

<PAGE>

             (ii) The aggregate principal amount of Revolving A Loans
outstanding at any time to the Borrower shall not exceed the difference between
(A) the lower of (x) the Revolver A Borrowing Base and (y) the Total Revolving A
Credit Commitment, and (B) the aggregate Letter of Credit Obligations.

             (iii) The aggregate principal amount of Revolving B Loans
outstanding at any time to the Borrower shall not exceed the lesser of (A) the
Total Revolving B Credit Commitment, and (B) the result of (w) the Borrowing
Base, minus (x) the outstanding principal amount of the Term Loan, minus (y) the
outstanding Revolving A Loans, minus (z) the aggregate Letter of Credit
Obligations.

             (iv) The aggregate principal amount of the Term Loan made on the
Term Loan Funding Date shall not exceed the Total Term Loan Commitment. Any
principal amount of the Term Loan which is repaid or prepaid may not be
reborrowed.

             (v) The aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Loans and the
Letter of Credit Obligations shall not at any time exceed the lower of (x) the
then current Borrowing Base, (y) the Maximum Amount and (z) the maximum
principal amount of senior indebtedness that is permitted to be incurred by the
Borrower and its Subsidiaries under the Public Subordinated Debt Indenture.

             (vi) The Revolving Credit Commitment of each Lender shall
automatically and permanently be reduced to zero on the Final Maturity Date.
Within the foregoing limits, the Borrower may borrow, repay and reborrow the
Revolving Loans, on or after the Effective Date and prior to the Final Maturity
Date, subject to the terms, provisions and limitations set forth herein.
Anything to the contrary in this Agreement notwithstanding, the Administrative
Agent shall create and maintain the Royalty Payments Suspense Account Reserve
and may, and at the request of the Required Lenders, shall create other reserves
against the Borrowing Base or the Revolver A Borrowing Base or reduce one or
more of the percentages set forth in the definition of Borrowing Base with
respect to the stated categories of oil and gas reserves (in either case without
declaring an Event of Default) as the Administrative Agent determines, in its
reasonable judgment (from the perspective of an asset-based lender), as being
appropriate to reflect impediments to the Collateral Agent's ability to realize
upon the Collateral or impairments or reductions to the value of the Collateral
(in each case, an "Agent Reserve", and collectively, the "Agent Reserves").
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Agent Reserves may include
(but are not limited to) reserves based upon (A) past due or accrued taxes or
other governmental charges, including ad valorem, personal property and other
taxes which may have priority over the Liens or security interests of the
Collateral Agent in the Collateral; (B) Liens in favor of third Persons,
including, without limitation, any Governmental Authority (whether or not such
Liens are Permitted Liens; (C) estimates of present and future costs, expenses,
deposits and liabilities related to the plugging and abandonment of the Oil and
Gas Properties (net of the amount thereof which has been taken into account in
the most recent Reserve Report or is fully secured by an escrow arrangement
acceptable to the Administrative Agent); (D) without duplication of the
foregoing, amounts owing by the Borrower to any Person, including, without
limitation, any Governmental Authority, to the extent secured by a Lien (whether
or not such Lien is a Permitted Lien) on, or trust (constructive or otherwise)
over, any of the Collateral (including proceeds thereof or collections from the
sale of Hydrocarbons which


                                      -36-

<PAGE>

may from time to time come into the possession of any of the Lenders or their
agents), which Lien or trust, in the reasonable determination of the
Administrative Agent (from the perspective of an asset-based lender), has a
reasonable possibility of having a priority superior to the Collateral Agent's
Liens (such as landlord liens, ad valorem taxes, production taxes, severance
taxes, sales taxes, collections attributable to sale of Hydrocarbons of Persons
other than the Borrower or its Subsidiaries) in and to such item of Collateral,
proceeds or collection; and (E) to the extent not taken into account in the most
recent Reserve Report delivered to the Agents, amounts which the Administrative
Agent reasonably determines are appropriate to account for interests of Persons
other than the Loan Parties (including without limitation interests under the
Production Payment 2001 Facility or the Takeout VPP Facility) and natural gas
imbalances of the Loan Parties. The Borrower and the Agents understand and agree
that any amount of Agent Reserves shall not be considered a disbursement bearing
interest hereunder, but rather shall be an amount that is not available for
borrowing by the Borrower.

     Section 2.02 Making the Loans. (a) The Borrower shall give the
Administrative Agent prior telephonic notice (immediately confirmed in writing,
in substantially the form of Exhibit 2.02 hereto (a "Notice of Borrowing")), not
later than 1:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the date which is 1 Business Day
prior to the date of the proposed Loan if such proposed Loan is a Reference Rate
Loan or 3 Business Days prior to the date of the proposed Loan if such proposed
Loan is a LIBOR Rate Loan (or such shorter period as the Administrative Agent is
willing to accommodate from time to time, but in no event later than 1:00 p.m.
(New York City time) on the borrowing date of the proposed Loan). Such Notice of
Borrowing shall be irrevocable and shall specify (i) the principal amount of the
proposed Loan, (ii) whether such Loan is a Revolving A Loan or a Revolving B
Loan, (iii) in the case of a Revolving A Loan, whether such Loan is a Reference
Rate Loan or a LIBOR Rate Loan, and, in the case of a LIBOR Rate Loan, the
initial Interest Period with respect thereto; and (iv) the proposed borrowing
date, which must be a Business Day, and, with respect to the Term Loan, must be
the Term Loan Funding Date. The Administrative Agent and the Lenders may act
without liability upon the basis of written, telecopied or telephonic notice
believed by the Administrative Agent in good faith to be from the Borrower (or
from any employee of the Borrower). The Borrower hereby waives the right to
dispute the Administrative Agent's record of the terms of any such telephonic
Notice of Borrowing. The Administrative Agent and each Lender shall be entitled
to rely conclusively on any Authorized Officer's authority to request a Loan on
behalf of the Borrower until the Administrative Agent receives written notice to
the contrary. The Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall have no duty to
verify the authenticity of the signature appearing on any written Notice of
Borrowing. The proceeds of all Revolving Loans shall be disbursed by the
Administrative Agent into the Disbursement Account.

     (b) Each Notice of Borrowing pursuant to this Section 2.02 shall be
irrevocable and the Borrower shall be bound to make a borrowing in accordance
therewith. Except for Loans made by any charge to the Loan Account, each
Revolving Loan shall be made in a minimum amount of $1,000,000 and shall be in
integral multiples of $500,000 in excess thereof. No more than 5 Interest
Periods in the aggregate may exist at any one time.

     (c) (i) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 2.02(c), all Loans
under this Agreement shall be made by the Lenders simultaneously and
proportionately to their Pro Rata Shares of the Total Revolving A Credit
Commitment, the Total Revolving B Credit Commitment


                                      -37-

<PAGE>

and the Total Term Loan Commitment, as the case may be, it being understood that
no Lender shall be responsible for any default by any other Lender in that other
Lender's obligations to make a Loan requested hereunder, nor shall the
Commitment of any Lender be increased or decreased as a result of the default by
any other Lender in that other Lender's obligation to make a Loan requested
hereunder, and each Lender shall be obligated to make the Loans required to be
made by it by the terms of this Agreement regardless of the failure by any other
Lender.

             (ii) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, and in
order to reduce the number of fund transfers among the Borrower, the Agents and
the Lenders, the Borrower, the Agents and the Lenders agree that the
Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to), and the Borrower and
the Lenders hereby irrevocably authorize the Administrative Agent to, fund, on
behalf of the Lenders with a Revolving Credit Commitment, Revolving Loans
pursuant to Section 2.01, subject to the procedures for settlement set forth in
Section 2.02(d); provided, however, that (a) the Administrative Agent shall in
no event fund any such Revolving Loans if the Administrative Agent shall have
received written notice from the Collateral Agent or the Required Lenders on the
Business Day prior to the date of the proposed Revolving Loan that one or more
of the conditions precedent contained in Section 5.02 will not be satisfied at
the time of the proposed Revolving Loan, and (b) the Administrative Agent shall
not otherwise be required to determine that, or take notice whether, the
conditions precedent in Section 5.02 have been satisfied. If the Borrower gives
a Notice of Borrowing requesting a Revolving Loan and the Administrative Agent
elects not to fund such Revolving Loan on behalf of the Revolving Loan Lenders,
then promptly after receipt of the Notice of Borrowing requesting such Revolving
Loan, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Revolving Loan Lender of the
specifics of the requested Revolving Loan and that it will not fund the
requested Revolving Loan on behalf of the Revolving Loan Lenders. If either (x)
the Borrower gives a Notice of Borrowing requesting a Revolving A Loan that is a
LIBOR Rate Loan or (y) the Administrative Agent notifies the Revolving Loan
Lenders that it will not fund a requested Revolving Loan on behalf of such
Revolving Loan Lenders, each Revolving Loan Lender shall make its Pro Rata Share
of the Revolving Loan available to the Administrative Agent, in immediately
available funds, at the Payment Office no later than 3:00 p.m. (New York City
time) (provided that the Administrative Agent requests payment from such
Revolving Loan Lender not later than 1:00 p.m. (New York City time)) on the date
of the proposed Revolving Loan. The Administrative Agent will make the proceeds
of such Revolving Loans available to the Borrower on the day of the proposed
Revolving Loan by causing an amount, in immediately available funds, equal to
the proceeds of all such Revolving Loans received by the Administrative Agent at
the Payment Office or the amount funded by the Administrative Agent on behalf of
the Revolving Loan Lenders to be deposited in an account designated by the
Borrower.

             (iii) If the Administrative Agent has notified the Revolving Loan
Lenders that the Administrative Agent, on behalf of such Revolving Loan Lenders,
will fund a particular Revolving Loan pursuant to Section 2.02(c)(ii), the
Administrative Agent may assume that each such Revolving Loan Lender has made
such amount available to the Administrative Agent on such day and the
Administrative Agent, in its sole discretion, may, but shall not be obligated
to, cause a corresponding amount to be made available to the Borrower on such
day. If the Administrative Agent makes such corresponding amount available to
the Borrower and such corresponding amount is not in fact made available to the
Administrative Agent by any such Revolving Loan Lender, the Administrative Agent
shall be entitled to recover


                                      -38-

<PAGE>

such corresponding amount on demand from such Revolving Loan Lender together
with interest thereon, for each day from the date such payment was due until the
date such amount is paid to the Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate
for 3 Business Days and thereafter at the Reference Rate. During the period in
which such Revolving Loan Lender has not paid such corresponding amount to the
Administrative Agent, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement or any other Loan Document, the amount so advanced by the
Administrative Agent to the Borrower shall, for all purposes hereof, be a
Revolving Loan made by the Administrative Agent for its own account. Upon any
such failure by a Revolving Loan Lender to pay the Administrative Agent, the
Administrative Agent shall promptly thereafter notify the Borrower of such
failure and the Borrower shall immediately pay such corresponding amount to the
Administrative Agent for its own account.

             (iv) Nothing in this Section 2.02(c) shall be deemed to relieve any
Revolving Loan Lender from its obligations to fulfill its Revolving Credit
Commitment hereunder or to prejudice any rights that the Administrative Agent or
the Borrower may have against any Revolving Loan Lender as a result of any
default by such Revolving Loan Lender hereunder.

     (d) (i) With respect to each LIBOR Rate Loan, on the first and last day of
each Interest Period, and with respect to all periods for which the
Administrative Agent has funded Revolving Loans pursuant to Section 2.02(c), on
Friday of each week, or if the applicable Friday is not a Business Day, then on
the following Business Day, or such shorter period as the Administrative Agent
may from time to time select (any such week or shorter period being herein
called a "Settlement Period"), the Administrative Agent shall notify each
Revolving Loan Lender of the unpaid principal amount of the Revolving Loans
outstanding as of the last day of each such Settlement Period. In the event that
such amount is greater than the unpaid principal amount of the Revolving Loans
outstanding on the last day of the Settlement Period immediately preceding such
Settlement Period (or, if there has been no preceding Settlement Period, the
amount of the Revolving Loans made on the date of such Revolving Loan Lender's
initial funding), each Revolving Loan Lender shall promptly (and in any event
not later than 2:00 p.m. (New York City time) if the Administrative Agent
requests payment from such Lender not later than 12:00 noon (New York City time)
on such day) make available to the Administrative Agent its Pro Rata Share of
the difference in immediately available funds. In the event that such amount is
less than such unpaid principal amount, the Administrative Agent shall promptly
pay over to each Revolving Loan Lender its Pro Rata Share of the difference in
immediately available funds. In addition, if the Administrative Agent shall so
request at any time when a Default or an Event of Default shall have occurred
and be continuing, or any other event shall have occurred as a result of which
the Administrative Agent shall determine that it is desirable to present claims
against the Borrower for repayment, each Revolving Loan Lender shall promptly
remit to the Administrative Agent or, as the case may be, the Administrative
Agent shall promptly remit to each Revolving Loan Lender, sufficient funds to
adjust the interests of the Revolving Loan Lenders in the then outstanding
Revolving Loans to such an extent that, after giving effect to such adjustment,
each such Revolving Loan Lender's interest in the then outstanding Revolving
Loans will be equal to its Pro Rata Share thereof. The obligations of the
Administrative Agent and each Revolving Loan Lender under this Section 2.02(d)
shall be absolute and unconditional. Each Revolving Loan Lender shall only be
entitled to receive


                                      -39-

<PAGE>

interest on its Pro Rata Share of the Revolving Loans which have been funded by
such Revolving Loan Lender.

             (ii) In the event that any Revolving Loan Lender fails to make any
payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.02(d)(i), the
Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover such corresponding amount on
demand from such Revolving Loan Lender together with interest thereon, for each
day from the date such payment was due until the date such amount is paid to the
Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate for 3 Business Days and
thereafter at the Reference Rate. During the period in which such Revolving Loan
Lender has not paid such corresponding amount to the Administrative Agent,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement or any
other Loan Document, the amount so advanced by the Administrative Agent to the
Borrower shall, for all purposes hereof, be a Revolving Loan made by the
Administrative Agent for its own account. Upon any such failure by a Revolving
Loan Lender to pay the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent shall
promptly thereafter notify the Borrower of such failure and the Borrower shall
immediately pay such corresponding amount to the Administrative Agent for its
own account. Nothing in this Section 2.02(d)(ii) shall be deemed to relieve any
Revolving Loan Lender from its obligation to fulfill its Revolving Credit
Commitment hereunder or to prejudice any rights that the Administrative Agent or
the Borrower may have against any Revolving Loan Lender as a result of any
default by such Revolving Loan Lender hereunder.

     Section 2.03 Repayment of Loans; Evidence of Debt (a) The outstanding
principal of all Revolving Loans shall be due and payable on the Final Maturity
Date.

     (b) The outstanding principal of the Term Loan shall be repaid in full on
the earlier of (i) the termination of the Total Revolving Credit Commitment and
(ii) the Final Maturity Date.

     (c) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an
account or accounts evidencing the Indebtedness of the Borrower to such Lender
resulting from each Loan made by such Lender, including the amounts of principal
and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder.

     (d) The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which it shall
record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, (ii) the amount of any
principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the
Borrower to each Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by
the Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of the Lenders and each
Lender's share thereof.

     (e) The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to subsections (c)
or (d) of this Section 2.03 shall be prima facie evidence of the existence and
amounts of the obligations recorded therein; provided that the failure of any
Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or any error
therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay
the Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

     (f) Any Lender may request that Loans made by it be evidenced by a
promissory note. In such event, the Borrower shall execute and deliver to such
Lender a


                                      -40-

<PAGE>

promissory note payable to the order of such Lender (or, if requested by such
Lender, to such Lender and its registered assigns) in a form furnished by the
Collateral Agent and reasonably acceptable to the Borrower. Thereafter, the
Loans evidenced by such promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times
(including after assignment pursuant to Section 12.07) be represented by one or
more promissory notes in such form payable to the order of the payee named
therein (or, if such promissory note is a registered note, to such payee and its
registered assigns in accordance with this Agreement).

     Section 2.04 Interest (a) Revolving A Loans. Each Revolving A Loan shall
bear interest on the principal amount thereof from time to time outstanding,
from the date of such Loan until such principal is repaid, at a rate per annum
equal to (i) if such Loan is a Reference Rate Loan, the Reference Rate plus the
Applicable Reference Rate Margin and (ii) if such Loan is a LIBOR Rate Loan,
LIBOR plus the Applicable LIBOR Margin.

     (b) Revolving B Loans and the Term Loan. Each Revolving B Loan and the Term
Loan shall bear interest on the principal amount thereof from time to time
outstanding, (i) from the date of the making of the initial Loan hereunder until
the date that is 12 months after the date of the making of such initial Loan, at
a rate per annum equal to the Reference Rate plus 4.25 percentage points, (ii)
from the date that is 12 months after the date of the making of the initial Loan
hereunder until the date that is 24 months after the date of the making of such
initial Loan, at a rate per annum equal to the Reference Rate plus 5.75
percentage points, and (iii) from the date that is 24 months after the date of
the making of the initial Loan hereunder until such principal amount is repaid,
at a rate per annum equal to the Reference Rate plus 9.50 percentage points;
provided, however, that the Reference Rate, as used herein for calculating the
effective interest rate on each Revolving B Loan and the Term Loan, shall at no
time be deemed to be less than 4.75% per annum or greater than 5.50% per annum.

     (c) Default Interest. Notwithstanding Sections 2.04(a) and (b), to the
extent permitted by law, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an
Event of Default, (i) the principal of, (ii) all past-due, accrued and unpaid
interest on, all Loans, (iii) past-due fees, (iv) indemnities, (v) outstanding
Reimbursement Obligations or (vi) any other Obligations of the Loan Parties
under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, shall bear interest, from the
date such Event of Default occurred until the date such Event of Default is
cured or waived in writing in accordance herewith, at a rate per annum equal at
all times to the Post-Default Rate.

     (d) Interest Payment. Interest on each Loan, other than LIBOR Rate Loans,
shall be payable monthly, in arrears, on the first day of each month, commencing
on the first day of the month following the month in which such Loan is made and
at maturity (whether upon demand, by acceleration or otherwise). Interest on
each LIBOR Rate Loan with an Interest Period of 1, 2 or 3 months shall be
payable in arrears on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto and
at maturity (whether upon demand, by acceleration or otherwise). Interest on
each LIBOR Rate Loan with an Interest Period of 6 months shall be payable in
arrears on the last day of the 3rd month of the Interest Period applicable
thereto, on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto and at
maturity (whether upon demand, by acceleration or otherwise). Interest at the
Post-Default Rate shall be payable on demand. The Borrower hereby authorizes the
Administrative Agent to, and the Administrative Agent may, from time to time,
charge the Loan Account pursuant to Section 4.02 with the amount of any interest
payment due hereunder.


                                      -41-

<PAGE>

     (e) General. All interest that is calculated based on the Reference Rate
shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as applicable, for
the actual number of days, including the first day but excluding the last day,
elapsed. All interest that is calculated based on LIBOR shall be computed on the
basis of a year of 360 days, for the actual number of days, including the first
day but excluding the last day, elapsed.

     Section 2.05 Reduction of Commitment; Prepayment of Loans.

     (a) Reduction of Commitments.

             (i) Revolving Credit Commitments. Each of the Total Revolving A
Credit Commitment and the Total Revolving B Credit Commitment shall terminate on
the Final Maturity Date. The Borrower may, without premium or penalty, reduce
the Total Revolving A Credit Commitment to an amount (which may be zero) not
less than the sum of (A) the aggregate unpaid principal amount of all Revolving
A Loans then outstanding, (B) the aggregate principal amount of all Revolving A
Loans not yet made as to which a Notice of Borrowing has been given by the
Borrower under Section 2.02, (C) the Letter of Credit Obligations at such time
and (D) the stated amount of all Letters of Credit not yet issued as to which a
request has been made and not withdrawn. The Borrower may, without premium or
penalty, reduce the Total Revolving B Credit Commitment to an amount (which may
be zero) not less than the sum of (A) the aggregate unpaid principal amount of
all Revolving B Loans then outstanding, and (B) the aggregate principal amount
of all Revolving B Loans not yet made as to which a Notice of Borrowing has been
given by the Borrower under Section 2.02. Each such reduction shall be in an
amount which is an integral multiple of $500,000 (unless the Total Revolving A
Credit Commitment or the Total Revolving B Credit Commitment, as applicable, in
effect immediately prior to such reduction is less than $500,000), shall be made
by providing not less than 5 Business Days prior written notice to the
Administrative Agent and shall be irrevocable. Once reduced, the Total Revolving
A Credit Commitment and the Total Revolving B Credit Commitment may not be
increased. Each such reduction of the Total Revolving A Credit Commitment or the
Total Revolving B Credit Commitment shall reduce the Revolving A Credit
Commitment or the Revolving B Credit Commitment, as applicable, of each Lender
proportionately in accordance with its Pro Rata Share thereof.

             (ii) Term Loan. The Total Term Loan Commitment shall terminate upon
the making of the Term Loan on the Term Loan Funding Date.

     (b) Optional Prepayment.

             (i) Revolving Loans. The Borrower, at its option, may prepay
without penalty or premium (other than the Applicable Early Termination Fee in
the case of the Revolving A Loans) the principal of any Revolving A Loan or
Revolving B Loan, designated by the Borrower, in whole or in part.

             (ii) Term Loan. The Borrower may, upon at least 5 Business Days
prior written notice to the Administrative Agent, prepay without penalty or
premium the principal of the Term Loan, in whole or in part, so long as, after
giving effect to such prepayment, no Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing and the Borrower has Revolver


                                      -42-

<PAGE>

A Availability of at least $15,000,000. Each prepayment made pursuant to this
Section 2.05(b)(ii) shall be accompanied by the payment of accrued and unpaid
interest to the date of such payment on the amount prepaid.

             (iii) Application. All optional prepayments shall be applied as
directed by the Borrower subject to Section 2.05(b)(ii) in the case of the Term
Loan.

     (c) Mandatory Prepayment.

             (i) The Borrower shall immediately prepay the Loans at any time
when the aggregate principal amount of all Loans plus the outstanding amount of
all Letter of Credit Obligations exceeds the least of (A) the Borrowing Base,
(B) the Maximum Amount and (C) the maximum principal amount of senior
indebtedness that is permitted to be incurred by the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries under the Public Subordinated Debt Indenture, to the full extent of
any such excess with such prepayment to be applied to the Loans as directed by
the Borrower. The Borrower shall immediately prepay the Revolving A Loans at any
time when the aggregate principal amount of all Revolving A Loans plus the
outstanding amount of all Letter of Credit Obligations exceeds the lesser of (A)
the Revolver A Borrowing Base and (B) the Total Revolving A Commitment, to the
full extent of any such excess. The Borrower shall immediately prepay the
Revolving B Loans at any time when the aggregate principal amount of all
Revolving B Loans exceeds the lesser of (A) the result of (w) the Borrowing
Base, minus (x) the outstanding principal amount of the Term Loan, minus (y) the
outstanding Revolving A Loans, minus (z) the aggregate Letter of Credit
Obligations, and (B) the Total Revolving B Credit Commitment, to the full extent
of any such excess. On each day that any Loans or Letter of Credit Obligations
are outstanding, the Borrower shall hereby be deemed to represent and warrant to
the Agents and the Lenders that the Borrowing Base then in effect equals or
exceeds the aggregate principal amount of all Loans and Letter of Credit
Obligations outstanding on such day. On each day that any Revolving A Loans or
Letter of Credit Obligations are outstanding, the Borrower shall hereby be
deemed to represent and warrant to the Agents and the Revolving A Lenders that
the Revolver A Borrowing Base then in effect equals or exceeds the aggregate
principal amount of all Revolving A Loans and Letter of Credit Obligations
outstanding on such day. If at any time after the Borrower has complied with the
first sentence or the second sentence of this Section 2.05(c)(i), the aggregate
Letter of Credit Obligations is greater than the then current Borrowing Base or
Revolver A Borrowing Base, as applicable, the Borrower shall provide cash
collateral to the Administrative Agent in an amount equal to 110% of such
excess, which cash collateral shall be deposited in the Letter of Credit
Collateral Account and, provided that no Event of Default shall have occurred
and be continuing, returned to the Borrower, at such time as the aggregate
Letter of Credit Obligations plus the aggregate principal amount of all
outstanding Loans no longer exceeds the then current Borrowing Base or Revolver
A Borrowing Base, as applicable.

             (ii) [Intentionally omitted]

             (iii) The Borrower shall immediately prepay the outstanding
principal amount of the Term Loan in the event that the Total Revolving A Credit
Commitment is terminated for any reason.

             (iv) The Administrative Agent shall on each Business Day apply all
funds transferred to or deposited in the Administrative Agent's Account, to the
payment, in whole or in part, of the outstanding principal amount of the
Revolving Loans. So long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing,
(A) the Borrower shall determine whether such funds are applied to the Revolving
A Loans or the Revolving B Loans and (B) any funds remaining in the
Administrative Agent's Account after payment of the outstanding principal amount
of the Revolving Loans shall be, upon request by the Borrower, disbursed by the
Administrative Agent into the Disbursement Account.

             (v) Immediately upon receipt of any proceeds of any Disposition by
any Loan Party or its Subsidiaries other than a Permitted Disposition (except
Permitted Dispositions of the type described in clauses (b), (c), (d), (e) and
(g) of the definition of Permitted Dispositions), the Borrower shall prepay the
outstanding principal amount of the Loans in an amount equal to 100% of the Net
Cash Proceeds received by such Person in connection with such Disposition to the
extent that the aggregate amount of Net Cash Proceeds received by all Loan
Parties and their Subsidiaries (and not paid to the Administrative Agent as a
prepayment of the Loans) shall exceed for all such Dispositions during any
Fiscal Year $4,000,000. Nothing contained in this clause (v) shall permit any
Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries to make a Disposition of any property
other than a Permitted Disposition.

             (vi) Upon the issuance or incurrence by any Loan Party or any of
its Subsidiaries of any Indebtedness of the type contemplated by clause (iii) of
such term (other than the Public Subordinated Debt and Indebtedness referred to
in clauses (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f) and (h) of the definition of Permitted
Indebtedness), or the sale or issuance by any Loan Party or any of its
Subsidiaries of any shares of its Capital Stock, the Borrower shall prepay the
Loans in an amount equal to 80% of the Net Cash Proceeds received by such Person
in connection therewith; provided that any sale or issuance of Capital Stock by
the Borrower to its officers, directors or employees shall not trigger a
mandatory prepayment obligation hereunder so long as such sale or issuance does
not exceed $500,000 during any period of 6 consecutive months. The provisions of
this subsection (vi) shall not be deemed to be implied consent to any such
issuance, incurrence or sale otherwise prohibited by the terms and conditions of
this Agreement.

             (vii) Upon the receipt by any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries
of any Extraordinary Receipts, the Borrowers shall prepay the outstanding
principal of the Loans in an amount equal to 100% of such Extraordinary
Receipts, net of any reasonable expenses incurred in collecting such
Extraordinary Receipts.

             (viii) In the event that the aggregate amount of the cash and
Permitted Investments of the Loan Parties and their Subsidiaries exceeds, as of
the 15th day of each month, $5,000,000, the Borrower shall on the next Business
Day prepay the outstanding principal of the Loans in the amount equal to such
excess.

             (ix) Concurrently with the consummation of the Takeout VPP
Facility, the Borrower shall prepay the outstanding principal amount of the
Revolving B Loans and the Term Loan in full and the Total Revolving B Credit
Commitment shall thereupon be


                                      -44-

<PAGE>

automatically terminated and the remaining proceeds therefrom shall be applied
to the Revolving A Loans.

     (d) Application of Payments. Each prepayment made pursuant to subsections
(c)(v), (c)(vi), (c)(vii) and (c)(viii) above shall be applied, first, to the
Revolving Loans and, second, to the Term Loan; provided that, with respect to
any prepayment that is sufficient to pay all outstanding Revolving Loans in
full, after such payment in full of the principal amount of the Revolving Loans,
the Borrower may, once during the term of this Agreement, re-invest in the Oil
and Gas Business of the Loan Parties a sum of up to $5,000,000 of the remaining
funds designated for prepayment (which must be reinvested within 120 days after
the event giving rise to such prepayment and if not reinvested within such time
frame such funds shall be applied to the Loans as determined by the Borrower)
and the balance of such remaining funds shall be applied to the Term Loan. So
long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Borrower shall
determine whether such prepayments are applied to the Revolving A Loans or the
Revolving B Loans.

     (e) Interest and Fees. Any prepayment made pursuant to this Section 2.05
(other than prepayments made pursuant to subsections (c)(i), (c)(ii), (c)(iii),
and (c)(iv) of this Section 2.05) shall be accompanied by accrued and unpaid
interest on the principal amount being prepaid to the date of prepayment, and
(i) if such prepayment would reduce the amount of the outstanding Loans to zero
at a time when the Total Revolving Credit Commitment has been terminated, such
prepayment shall be accompanied by the payment of all fees accrued to such date
pursuant to Section 2.06 and the Fee Letter or (ii) if such prepayment would
reduce the amount of the outstanding Term Loan and Revolving B Loans to zero at
a time when the Total Revolving B Credit Commitment has been terminated, such
prepayment shall be accompanied by the payment of all fees accrued to such date
pursuant to the Fee Letter.

     (f) Cumulative Prepayments. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Section 2.05, payments with respect to any subsection of this Section 2.05 are
in addition to payments made or required to be made under any other subsection
of this Section 2.05.

     Section 2.06 Fees.

     (a) Unused Line Fee. From and after the Effective Date and until the Final
Maturity Date, the Borrower shall pay monthly to the Administrative Agent for
the account of the Revolving A Loan Lenders, in accordance with their Pro Rata
Shares, an unused line fee (the "Unused Line Fee"), which shall accrue at the
rate per annum of 0.5% on the excess, if any, of the Total Revolving A Credit
Commitment over the sum of the average principal amount of all Revolving A Loans
and Letter of Credit Obligations outstanding from time to time during the
relevant month and shall be payable monthly in arrears on the first day of each
month commencing February 1, 2003.

     (b) Fee Letter Fees. As and when due and payable under the terms of the Fee
Letter, the Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent the fees set forth in
the Fee Letter.


                                      -45-

     (c) Revolving A Credit Commitment Early Termination Fee. If the Total
Revolving A Credit Commitment is terminated and all Obligations in respect of
the Total Revolving A Credit Commitment are paid in full (the first date on
which such events occur is hereafter referred to as the "A Facility Termination
Date") prior to October 3, 2005, the Borrower shall pay to the Administrative
Agent for the account of the Revolving A Loan Lenders an amount equal to the
Applicable Early Termination Fee. In the event the A Facility Termination Date
occurs at any time prior to October 3, 2005, for any reason, including, without
limitation, (A) as a result of the occurrence of an Event of Default, (B)
foreclosure and sale of Collateral, (C) sale of the Collateral in any Insolvency
Proceeding, or (D) restructure, reorganization, or compromise of the Obligations
by the confirmation of a plan of reorganization or any other plan of compromise,
restructure, or arrangement in any Insolvency Proceeding, then, the Borrower
shall pay the Applicable Early Termination Fee to the Administrative Agent for
the account of the Revolving A Loan Lenders, measured as of the date the A
Facility Termination Date shall occur; provided, however, if the A Facility
Termination Date occurs prior to October 3, 2005 as a result of (y) a sale
(including a sale transaction accomplished through a merger) of all or
substantially all of the Loan Parties' assets or all of the Stock of the
Borrower, in each case, to an unaffiliated third Person or (z) a refinancing of
the Total Revolving A Credit Commitment by a commercial banking unit of Wells
Fargo Bank, National Association, the Applicable Early Termination Fee shall be
zero.

     Section 2.07 Securitization. The Loan Parties hereby acknowledge that the
Lenders and their Affiliates may sell or securitize the Loans (a
"Securitization") through the pledge of the Loans as collateral security for
loans to the Lenders or their Affiliates or through the sale of the Loans or the
issuance of direct or indirect interests in the Loans, which loans to the
Lenders or their Affiliates or direct or indirect interests will be rated by
Moody's, Standard & Poor's or one or more other rating agencies (the "Rating
Agencies"). The Loan Parties shall cooperate with the Lenders and their
Affiliates to effect the Securitization including, without limitation, by (a)
amending this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and executing such
additional documents, as reasonably requested by the Lenders in connection with
the Securitization, provided that (i) any such amendment or additional
documentation does not impose material additional costs on the Loan Parties and
(ii) any such amendment or additional documentation does not materially
adversely affect the rights, or materially increase the obligations, of the Loan
Parties under the Loan Documents or change or affect in a manner adverse to the
Loan Parties the financial terms of the Loans, (b) providing such information as
may be reasonably requested by the Lenders in connection with the rating of the
Loans or the Securitization, and (c) providing in connection with any rating of
the Loans a certificate (i) agreeing to indemnify the Lenders and their
Affiliates, any of the Rating Agencies, or any party providing credit support or
otherwise participating in the Securitization (collectively, the "Securitization
Parties") for any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (the "Liabilities") to
which the Lenders, their Affiliates or such Securitization Parties may become
subject insofar as the Liabilities arise out of or are based upon any untrue
statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in any Loan
Document or in any writing delivered by or on behalf of any Loan Party to the
Lenders in connection with any Loan Document or arise out of or are based upon
the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be
stated therein, or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and such
indemnity shall survive any transfer by the Lenders or their successors or
assigns of the Loans and (ii) agreeing to reimburse the Lenders


                                      -46-

<PAGE>

and their Affiliates for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such
Persons in connection with defending the Liabilities.

     Section 2.08 Taxes. (a) All payments made by the Loan Parties hereunder or
under any other Loan Document shall be made without set-off, counterclaim,
deduction or other defense. All such payments shall be made free and clear of
and without deduction for any present or future income, franchise, sales, use,
excise, stamp or other taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges, fees, or
withholdings now or hereafter imposed, levied, collected, withheld or assessed
by any jurisdiction (whether pursuant to United States Federal, state, local or
foreign law) or by any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or
therein, and all interest, penalties or similar liabilities, excluding income
and other taxes based on the net income, capital or profits of, and branch
profit taxes of, any Lender, any Agent or the L/C Issuer imposed by the
jurisdiction in which such Lender, such Agent or the L/C Issuer is organized or
any political subdivision thereof or taxing authority thereof or any
jurisdiction in which such Person's principal office or relevant lending office
is located or any political subdivision thereof or taxing authority thereof
(such excluded taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges, fees and
withholdings being hereinafter collectively referred to as "Excluded Taxes" and
such nonexcluded taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges, fees, and
withholdings being hereinafter collectively referred to as "Taxes"). If the
Borrower shall be required by law, rule, regulation or any interpretation of any
relevant Governmental Authority to deduct or to withhold any Taxes from or in
respect of any amount payable hereunder,

             (i) the amount so payable shall be increased to the extent
necessary so that after making all required deductions and withholdings
(including Taxes on amounts payable to the Lenders, the Agents or the L/C Issuer
pursuant to this sentence) the Lenders, the Agents or the L/C Issuer receive an
amount equal to the sum they would have received had no such deduction or
withholding been made,

             (ii) the Borrower shall make such deduction or withholding, and

             (iii) the Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted or withheld
to the relevant taxation authority in accordance with applicable law. Whenever
any Taxes are payable by the Borrower, as promptly as possible thereafter, the
Borrower shall send the Lenders, the Agents and the L/C Issuer an official
receipt (or, if an official receipt is not available, such other documentation
as shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Lenders, the Agents or the L/C
Issuer, as the case may be) showing payment. In addition, the Borrower agrees to
pay any other present or future taxes, charges or similar levies which arise
from any payment made hereunder or from the execution, delivery, or performance
by any Loan Party, recordation or filing of, or otherwise with respect to, this
Agreement, the Letters of Credit or any other Loan Document other than the
Excluded Taxes (hereinafter referred to as "Other Taxes").

     (b) The Borrower hereby indemnifies the Lenders, the Agents and the L/C
Issuer for the amount of Taxes or Other Taxes (including, without limitation,
any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under
this Section 2.08) paid by any Lender, any Agent or the L/C Issuer and any
liability (including penalties, interest and expenses for nonpayment, late
payment or otherwise) arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or


                                      -47-

<PAGE>

not such Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally asserted. This
indemnification shall be paid within 15 days from the date on which any such
Lender, any such Agent or the L/C Issuer makes written demand therefor, which
demand shall identify with reasonable specificity the nature and amount of Taxes
or Other Taxes for which indemnification is being sought and the basis of the
claim.

     (c) Each Lender that is organized in a jurisdiction other than the United
States, a State thereof or the District of Columbia hereby agrees that:

             (i) it shall, no later than the Effective Date (or, in the case of
a Lender which becomes a party hereto pursuant to Section 12.07 hereof after the
Effective Date, the date upon which such Lender becomes a party hereto) deliver
to the Borrower and the Agents: (A) two accurate, complete and signed originals
of U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI or successor form, or (B) two
accurate, complete and signed originals of U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form
W-8BEN or successor form, in each case, indicating that such Lender is on the
date of delivery thereof entitled to receive payments of principal, interest and
fees for the account of its lending office under this Agreement free from, or
subject to a reduced rate of, withholding of United States Federal income tax;
and

             (ii) if at any time such Lender changes its lending office or
offices or selects an additional lending office for purposes of this Agreement,
it shall, at the same time or reasonably promptly thereafter, deliver to the
Borrower and the Agents the appropriate forms as described in clause (i) above
in replacement for, or in addition to, the forms previously delivered by it
hereunder.

     (d) If the Borrower fails to perform any of its obligations under this
Section 2.08, the Borrower shall indemnify the Lenders, the Agents and the L/C
Issuer for any taxes, interest or penalties that may become payable as a result
of any such failure. The obligations of the Loan Parties under this Section 2.08
shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and
all other amounts payable hereunder.

     Section 2.09 LIBOR Not Determinable; Illegality or Impropriety. (a) In the
event, and on each occasion, that on or before the day on which LIBOR is to be
determined for a borrowing that is to include LIBOR Rate Loans, the
Administrative Agent has determined in good faith that, or has been advised by
the Collateral Agent or the Required Lenders that, (i) LIBOR cannot be
reasonably determined for any reason, (ii) LIBOR will not adequately and fairly
reflect the cost of maintaining LIBOR Rate Loans or (iii) Dollar deposits in the
principal amount of the applicable LIBOR Rate Loans are not available in the
interbank eurodollar market where the eurodollar and foreign currency and
exchange operations in respect of the Revolving A Loan Lenders' LIBOR Rate Loans
are then being conducted, the Administrative Agent shall, as soon as practicable
thereafter, give written notice of such determination to the Borrower and the
other Lenders. In the event of any such determination, any request by the
Borrower for a LIBOR Rate Loan pursuant to Section 2.02 shall, until, (i) in the
case of such a determination by the Collateral Agent or the Required Lenders,
the Administrative Agent has been advised by the Collateral Agent or the
Required Lenders and the Administrative Agent has so advised the Borrower that,
or (ii) in the case of a determination by the Administrative Agent, the
Administrative Agent has advised the Borrower and the other Lenders that, the
circumstances


                                      -48-

<PAGE>

giving rise to such notice no longer exist, be deemed to be a request for a
Reference Rate Loan. Each determination by the Administrative Agent, the
Collateral Agent and/or the Required Lenders hereunder shall be conclusive and
binding absent manifest error.

     (b) In the event that it shall be unlawful or improper for any Revolving A
Loan Lender to make, maintain or fund any LIBOR Rate Loan as contemplated by
this Agreement, then such Revolving A Lender shall forthwith give notice thereof
to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower describing such illegality or
impropriety in reasonable detail. Effective immediately upon the giving of such
notice, the obligation of such Revolving A Loan Lender to make LIBOR Rate Loans
shall be suspended for the duration of such illegality or impropriety and, if
and when such illegality or impropriety ceases to exist, such suspension shall
cease, and such Revolving A Loan Lender shall notify the Administrative Agent
and the Borrower. If any such change shall make it unlawful or improper for any
Revolving A Loan Lender to maintain any outstanding LIBOR Rate Loan as a LIBOR
Rate Loan, such Revolving A Loan Lender shall, upon the happening of such event,
notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, and the Borrower shall
immediately, or if permitted by applicable law, rule, regulation, order, decree,
interpretation, request or directive, at the end of the then current Interest
Period for such LIBOR Rate Loan, convert each such LIBOR Rate Loan into a
Reference Rate Loan.

     Section 2.10 Indemnity. (a) The Borrower hereby indemnifies each Revolving
A Loan Lender against any loss or expense that such Revolving A Loan Lender
actually sustains or incurs (including, without limitation, any loss or expense
incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds
acquired by such Revolving A Loan Lender to fund or maintain any LIBOR Rate
Loan, and including loss of anticipated profits) as a consequence of (i) any
failure by the Borrower to fulfill on the date of any borrowing hereunder the
applicable conditions set forth in Article V, (ii) any failure by the Borrower
to borrow any LIBOR Rate Loan hereunder, to convert any Reference Rate Loan into
a LIBOR Rate Loan or to continue a LIBOR Rate Loan as such after notice of such
borrowing, conversion or continuation has been given pursuant to Section 2.02 or
2.11 hereof, (iii) any payment, prepayment (mandatory or optional) or conversion
of a LIBOR Rate Loan required by any provision of this Agreement or otherwise
made on a date other than the last day of the Interest Period applicable
thereto, (iv) any default in payment or prepayment of the principal amount of
any LIBOR Rate Loan or any part thereof or interest accrued thereon, as and when
due and payable (at the due date thereof, by notice of prepayment or otherwise),
or (v) the occurrence of any Event of Default, including, in each such case, any
loss (including, without limitation, loss of anticipated profits) or reasonable
expense sustained or incurred in liquidating or employing deposits from third
parties acquired to effect or maintain such Loan or any part thereof as a LIBOR
Rate Loan. Such loss or reasonable expense shall include but not be limited to
an amount equal to the excess, if any, as reasonably determined by such
Revolving A Loan Lender, of (i) its cost of obtaining the funds for the Loan
being paid or prepaid or converted or continued or not borrowed or converted or
continued (based on LIBOR applicable thereto) for the period from the date of
such payment, prepayment, conversion, continuation or failure to borrow, convert
or continue on the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan (or, in the
case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, the last day of the Interest
Period for such Loan that would have commenced on the date of such failure to
borrow, convert or continue) over (ii) the amount of interest (as reasonably
determined by such Revolving A Loan Lender) that would be


                                      -49-

<PAGE>

realized by such Revolving A Loan Lender in re-employing the funds so paid,
prepaid, converted or continued or not borrowed, converted or continued for such
Interest Period. A certificate of any Revolving A Loan Lender setting forth in
reasonable detail any amount or amounts that such Revolving A Loan Lender is
entitled to receive pursuant to this Section 2.10 and the basis for the
determination of such amount or amounts shall be delivered to the Borrower and
shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error.

     (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this Section 2.10, the Administrative
Agent will use reasonable efforts to minimize or reduce any such loss or expense
resulting from the mandatory prepayments required by Section 2.05 of this
Agreement by applying all payments and prepayments to Reference Rate Loans prior
to any application of payments to LIBOR Rate Loans.

     Section 2.11 Continuation and Conversion of Loans. Subject to Section 2.09
hereof, the Borrower shall have the right, at any time, on three (3) Business
Days prior irrevocable written notice to the Administrative Agent, to continue
any LIBOR Rate Loan, or any portion thereof, into a subsequent Interest Period
or to convert any Reference Rate Loan or portion thereof into a LIBOR Rate Loan,
or on one (1) Business Day prior irrevocable written notice to the
Administrative Agent, to convert any LIBOR Rate Loan or portion thereof into a
Reference Rate Loan, subject to the following:

     (a) no LIBOR Rate Loan may be continued as such and no Reference Rate Loan
may be converted into a LIBOR Rate Loan, when any Event of Default or Default
shall have occurred and be continuing at such time,

     (b) in the case of a continuation of a LIBOR Rate Loan as such or a
conversion of a Reference Rate Loan into a LIBOR Rate Loan, the aggregate
principal amount of such LIBOR Rate Loan shall not be less than $1,000,000 and
in multiples of $500,000 if in excess thereof;

     (c) any portion of a Revolving A Loan maturing or required to be repaid in
less than 1 month may not be converted into or continued as a LIBOR Rate Loan;
and

     (d) if any conversion of a LIBOR Rate Loan shall be effected on a day other
than the last day of an Interest Period, the Borrower shall reimburse each
Revolving A Loan Lender on demand for any loss incurred or to be incurred by it
in the reemployment of the funds released by such conversion as provided in
Section 2.10 hereof.

In the event that the Borrower shall not give notice to continue any LIBOR Rate
Loan into a subsequent Interest Period, such Loan shall automatically become a
Reference Rate Loan at the expiration of the then current Interest Period.

                                  ARTICLE III

                                LETTERS OF CREDIT

     Section 3.01 Letter of Credit Guaranty. (a) In order to assist the Borrower
in establishing or opening standby letters of credit, which shall not have
expiration dates later than


                                      -50-

<PAGE>

the Final Maturity Date (each a "Letter of Credit"), with the L/C Issuer, the
Borrower has requested the Administrative Agent to join in the applications for
such Letters of Credit, and/or guarantee payment or performance of such Letters
of Credit and any drafts thereunder through the issuance of a Letter of Credit
Guaranty, thereby lending the Administrative Agent's credit to that of the
Borrower, and the Administrative Agent has agreed to do so. These arrangements
shall be coordinated by the Administrative Agent, subject to the terms and
conditions set forth below. The Administrative Agent shall not be required to be
the issuer of any Letter of Credit. The Borrower will be the account party for
the application for each Letter of Credit, which shall be in form and substance
satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and the L/C Issuer or on a computer
transmission system approved by the Administrative Agent and the L/C Issuer, or
such other written form or computer transmission system as may from time to time
be reasonably approved by the Administrative Agent and the L/C Issuer, and shall
be duly completed at a time and in a manner reasonably acceptable to the
Administrative Agent, together with such other certificates, agreements,
documents and other papers and information as the Administrative Agent and the
L/C Issuer may reasonably request, which shall include without limitation, the
requested date of issuance and the name and address of the beneficiary (the
"Letter of Credit Application"). In the event of any conflict between the terms
of any Letter of Credit Application and this Agreement, for purposes of this
Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall control.

     (b) The aggregate Letter of Credit Obligations shall not exceed the lowest
of (i) the difference between (A) the Total Revolving A Credit Commitment and
(B) the aggregate principal amount of all Revolving A Loans then outstanding,
(ii) the difference between (A) the Revolver A Borrowing Base and (B) the
aggregate principal amount of all Revolving A Loans then outstanding, and (iii)
the L/C Subfacility. In addition, the terms and conditions of all Letters of
Credit and all changes or modifications thereof by the Borrower and/or the L/C
Issuer shall in all respects be subject to the prior approval of the
Administrative Agent in the exercise of its reasonable discretion; provided,
however, that (i) the expiry date of all Letters of Credit shall be no later
than the Final Maturity Date unless, on or prior to the Final Maturity Date
either (A) such Letters of Credit shall be cash collateralized in an amount
equal to 110% of the face amount of such Letters of Credit by deposit of cash in
such amount in an account under the sole and exclusive control of the
Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and/or the L/C
Issuer (the "Letter of Credit Collateral Account") or (B) the Borrower shall
provide the Administrative Agent and the Revolving A Loan Lenders with an
indemnification or back-up letter of credit, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, from a commercial bank reasonably
acceptable to the Agents for any Letter of Credit Obligations with respect to
such Letters of Credit and (ii) the Letters of Credit and all documentation in
connection therewith shall be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
the Administrative Agent and the L/C Issuer.

     (c) If the Administrative Agent is obligated to advance funds under a
Letter of Credit, the Administrative Agent may immediately reimburse such
disbursement by charging the Loan Account as set forth below. The Administrative
Agent shall have the right, without notice to the Borrower, to charge the Loan
Account with the amount of any and all Indebtedness, liabilities and obligations
of any kind (including indemnification for breakage costs, capital adequacy and
reserve requirement charges) incurred by the Agents or the Revolving A Loan
Lenders under the Letter of Credit Guaranty or incurred by the L/C Issuer with
respect to a Letter of Credit at the earlier of (i) payment by the
Administrative Agent or the


                                      -51-

<PAGE>

Revolving A Loan Lenders under the Letter of Credit Guaranty or (ii) the
occurrence of any Default or Event of Default. Any amount charged to the Loan
Account shall be deemed a Revolving A Loan hereunder made by the Revolving A
Loan Lenders to the Borrower, funded by the Administrative Agent on behalf of
the Revolving A Loan Lenders and subject to Section 2.02 of this Agreement. Any
charges, fees, commissions, costs and expenses charged to the Administrative
Agent for the Borrower's account by the L/C Issuer in connection with or arising
out of Letters of Credit or transactions relating thereto will be charged to the
Loan Account in full when charged to or paid by the Administrative Agent and,
when charged, shall be conclusive on the Borrower absent manifest error. Each of
the Revolving A Loan Lenders and the Borrower agrees that the Administrative
Agent shall have the right to make such charges regardless of whether any
Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing or whether any
of the conditions precedent in Section 5.02 have been satisfied.

     (d) The Borrower understands that the Letter of Credit Guaranties may
require the Revolving A Loan Lenders to indemnify the L/C Issuer for certain
costs or liabilities arising out of claims by the Borrower against such L/C
Issuer. The Borrower agrees to unconditionally indemnify each Agent and each
Revolving A Loan Lender and holds each Agent and each Revolving A Loan Lender
harmless from any and all loss, claim or liability incurred by any Agent or any
Revolving A Loan Lender arising from any transactions or occurrences relating to
Letters of Credit, any drafts or acceptances thereunder, the Collateral relating
thereto, and all Obligations in respect thereof, including any such loss or
claim due to any action taken by the L/C Issuer, other than for any such loss,
claim or liability arising out of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of
the L/C Issuer, any Agent or any Lender as determined by a final judgment of a
court of competent jurisdiction. The Borrower further agrees to hold each Agent
and each Lender harmless from any errors or omission, negligence or misconduct
by the L/C Issuer. The Borrower agrees to be bound by the L/C Issuer's
regulations and interpretations of any Letter of Credit that is the subject of a
Letter of Credit Guaranty and opened to or for the Borrower's account or by the
Administrative Agent's interpretations of any Letter of Credit issued for the
Borrower's account, even though such interpretation may be different from the
Borrower's own, and the Borrower understands and agrees that the Lenders, the
Agents and the L/C Issuer shall not be liable for any error, negligence or
mistake, whether of omission or commission, in following the Borrower's
instructions or those contained in the Letter of Credit or any modifications,
amendments, or supplements thereto. The Borrower's unconditional obligations to
each Agent, each Lender and the L/C Issuer with respect to Letters of Credit
hereunder shall not be modified or diminished for any reason or in any manner
whatsoever, other than as a result of such Agent's, such Lender's or the L/C
Issuer's gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a final
judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction. The Borrower agrees that any
charges incurred by the Administrative Agent or the L/C Issuer for the
Borrower's account hereunder may be charged to the Loan Account.

     (e) Upon any payments made to the L/C Issuer under the Letter of Credit
Guaranty, the Agents or the Revolving A Loan Lenders, as the case may be, shall,
without prejudice to their rights under this Agreement (including that such
unreimbursed amounts shall constitute Loans hereunder), acquire by subrogation,
any rights, remedies, duties or obligations granted or undertaken by the
Borrower in favor of the L/C Issuer in any application for Letters of Credit,
any standing agreement relating to Letters of Credit or otherwise, all of which
shall be deemed to have been granted to the Agents and the Revolving A Loan
Lenders and apply in all


                                      -52-

respects to the Agents and the Revolving A Loan Lenders and shall be in addition
to any rights, remedies, duties or obligations contained herein.

     Section 3.02 Participations.

     (a) Purchase of Participations. Immediately upon issuance by the L/C Issuer
of any Letter of Credit pursuant to this Agreement, each Revolving A Loan Lender
shall be deemed to have irrevocably and unconditionally purchased and received
from the Administrative Agent, without recourse or warranty, an undivided
interest and participation, to the extent of such Revolving A Loan Lender's Pro
Rata Share, in all obligations of the Administrative Agent in such Letter of
Credit (including, without limitation, all Reimbursement Obligations of the
Borrower with respect thereto pursuant to the Letter of Credit Guaranty or
otherwise).

     (b) Sharing of Payments. In the event that the Administrative Agent makes
any payment in respect of the Letter of Credit Guaranty and the Borrower shall
not have repaid such amount to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative
Agent shall charge the Loan Account in the amount of the Reimbursement
Obligation, in accordance with Sections 3.01(c) and 4.02 of this Agreement.

     (c) Obligations Irrevocable. The obligations of a Revolving A Loan Lender
to make payments to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Agents, the
Revolving A Loan Lenders or the L/C Issuer with respect to a Letter of Credit
shall be irrevocable, without any qualification or exception whatsoever and
shall be made in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement
under all circumstances, including, without limitation, any of the following
circumstances:

             (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of this Agreement or any
of the other Loan Documents;

             (ii) the existence of any claim, setoff, defense or other right
which the Borrower may have at any time against a beneficiary named in such
Letter of Credit or any transferee of such Letter of Credit (or any Person for
whom any such transferee may be acting), any Agent, any Lender, or any other
Person, whether in connection with this Agreement, such Letter of Credit, the
transactions contemplated herein or any unrelated transactions (including any
underlying transactions between the Borrower or any other party and the
beneficiary named in such Letter of Credit);

             (iii) any draft, certificate or any other document presented under
such Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient
in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any
respect;

             (iv) the surrender or impairment of any security for the

advance of such issuance but, in any event, not later than 12:00 noon, New York
City time, at least 2 Business Days in advance of the issuance thereof, request
the Administrative Agent to assist the Borrower in establishing or opening a
Letter of Credit by delivering to the Administrative Agent, with a copy to the
L/C Issuer, a Letter of Credit Application, together with any necessary related
documents. The Administrative Agent shall not provide support, pursuant to the
Letter of Credit Guaranty, if the Administrative Agent shall have received
written notice from the Collateral Agent or the Required Lenders on the Business
Day immediately preceding the proposed issuance date for such Letter of Credit
that one or more of the conditions precedent in Section 5.02 will not have been
satisfied on such date, and the Administrative Agent shall not otherwise be
required to determine that, or take notice whether, the conditions precedent set
forth in Section 5.02 have been satisfied.

     (b) Letter of Credit Fees. (i) The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative
Agent for the account of the Revolving A Loan Lenders, in accordance with the
Revolving A Loan Lenders' Pro Rata Shares (x) for any Letter of Credit issued
hereunder, a non-refundable fee equal to 2.0% per annum of the stated amount of
such Letter of Credit, payable monthly in arrears and (y) for any amendment to
an existing Letter of Credit that increases the stated amount of such Letter of
Credit, a non-refundable fee equal to 2.0% per annum of the increase in the
stated amount of such Letter of Credit, payable monthly in arrears (the "Letter
of Credit Fees").

             (ii) L/C Issuer Charges. The Borrower shall pay to the
Administrative Agent any and all charges assessed by the L/C Issuer in

Agreement with the amount of any Letter of Credit fees or charges due under this
Section 3.03.

                                   ARTICLE IV

                      FEES, PAYMENTS AND OTHER COMPENSATION

     Section 4.01 Audit and Collateral Monitoring Fees. The Borrower
acknowledges that pursuant to Section 7.01(f), representatives of the Agents may
visit any Loan Party and/or conduct audits, inspections and/or field
examinations (including, without limitation, examinations and audits of such
Loan Party's major wells, rigs, pipeline distribution systems and operations)
("Audits") of any Loan Party and valuations or appraisals of any or all of the


                                      -54-

<PAGE>

Collateral and/or business or enterprise valuations of the Loan Parties at any
time and from time to time, and so long as no Event of Default has occurred and
is continuing, Audits shall be conducted on reasonable notice during normal
business hours in a manner so as to not unduly disrupt the business of such Loan
Party; provided that so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing, the Borrower shall only be required to pay the fees and expenses of
no more than 2 Audits during any Fiscal Year. The Borrower agrees to pay (i)
$850 per day per examiner plus the examiner's reasonable out-of-pocket costs and
expenses incurred in connection with all such Audits, appraisals and valuations
and (ii) the cost of all Audits, appraisals and valuations conducted by third
party auditors or appraisers on behalf of the Agents; provided that so long as
no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Borrower shall only be
required to pay the fees and expenses of no more than 2 Audits during any Fiscal
Year.

     Section 4.02 Payments; Computations and Statements. (a) The Borrower will
make each payment under this Agreement not later than 3:00 p.m. (New York City
time) on the day when due, in lawful money of the United States of America and
in immediately available funds, to the Administrative Agent's Account. All
payments received by the Administrative Agent after 3:00 p.m. (New York City
time) on any Business Day will be applied to the Obligations for which such
payment has been made on the next succeeding Business Day. All payments shall be
made by the Borrower without set-off, counterclaim, deduction or other defense
to the Agents and the Lenders. Except as provided in Section 2.02, after
receipt, the Administrative Agent will promptly thereafter cause to be
distributed like funds relating to the payment of principal ratably to the
Lenders entitled to such payment in accordance with their Pro Rata Shares and
like funds relating to the payment of any other amount payable to any Lender to
such Lender, in each case to be applied in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, provided that the Administrative Agent will cause to be distributed
all interest and fees received from or for the account of the Borrower not less
than once each month and in any event promptly after receipt thereof. The
Lenders and the Borrower hereby authorize the Administrative Agent to, and the
Administrative Agent shall, from time to time, charge the Loan Account of the
Borrower with any amount due and payable by the Borrower under any Loan
Document. Each of the Lenders and the Borrower agrees that the Administrative
Agent shall have the right to make such charges whether or not any Default or
Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing or whether any of the
conditions precedent in Section 5.02 have been satisfied. Any amount charged to
the Loan Account of the Borrower shall be deemed a Revolving Loan (and a
Revolving A Loan to the extent of Revolver A Availability) hereunder made by the
applicable Revolving Loan Lenders to the Borrower, funded by the Administrative
Agent on behalf of the applicable Revolving Loan Lenders and subject to Section
2.02 of this Agreement. The Lenders and the Borrower confirm that any charges
which the Administrative Agent may so make to the Loan Account of the Borrower
as herein provided will be made as an accommodation to the Borrower and solely
at the Administrative Agent's discretion. Whenever any payment to be made under
any such Loan Document shall be stated to be due on a day other than a Business
Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day and such
extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of interest
or fees, as the case may be. All computations of fees shall be made by the
Administrative Agent on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as applicable,
for the actual number of days (including the first day but excluding the last
day) occurring in the period for which such fees are payable. Each determination
by the Administrative Agent of an interest rate or fees hereunder shall be
conclusive and binding for all purposes in the absence of manifest error.


                                      -55-

<PAGE>

     (b) The Administrative Agent shall provide the Borrower, promptly after the
end of each calendar month, a summary statement (in the form from time to time
used by the Administrative Agent) of the opening and closing daily balances in
the Loan Account of the Borrower during such month, the amounts and dates of all
Loans made to the Borrower during such month, the amounts and dates of all
payments on account of the Loans to the Borrower during such month and the Loans
to which such payments were applied, the amount of interest accrued on the Loans
to the Borrower during such month, any Letters of Credit issued by the L/C
Issuer for the account of the Borrower during such month, specifying the face
amount thereof, the amount of charges to the Loan Account and/or Loans made to
the Borrower during such month to reimburse the Revolving Loan Lenders for
drawings made under Letters of Credit, and the amount and nature of any charges
to the Loan Account made during such month on account of fees, commissions,
expenses and other Obligations. All entries on any such statement shall be
presumed to be correct and, 30 days after the same is sent, shall be final and
conclusive absent manifest error.

     Section 4.03 Sharing of Payments, Etc. Except as provided in Section 2.02
hereof, if any Lender shall obtain any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary,
through the exercise of any right of set-off, or otherwise) on account of any
Obligation in excess of its ratable share of payments on account of similar
obligations obtained by all the Lenders, such Lender shall forthwith purchase
from the other Lenders such participations in such similar obligations held by
them as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess
payment ratably with each of them; provided, however, that if all or any portion
of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from such purchasing Lender, such
purchase from each Lender shall be rescinded and such Lender shall repay to the
purchasing Lender the purchase price to the extent of such recovery together
with an amount equal to such Lender's ratable share (according to the proportion
of (i) the amount of such Lender's required repayment to (ii) the total amount
so recovered from the purchasing Lender of any interest or other amount paid by
the purchasing Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered). The Borrower
agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender
pursuant to this Section 4.03 may, to the fullest extent permitted by law,
exercise all of its rights (including the Lender's right of set-off) with
respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct
creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.

     Section 4.04 Apportionment of Payments. Subject to Section 2.02 hereof:

     (a) all payments of principal and interest in respect of outstanding Loans,
all payments in respect of the Reimbursement Obligations, all payments of fees
(other than the fees with respect to Letters of Credit provided for in Section
3.03(b)(ii) and the audit and collateral monitoring fees provided for in Section
4.01) and all other payments in respect of any other Obligations, shall be
allocated by the Administrative Agent among such of the Lenders as are entitled
thereto, in proportion to their respective Pro Rata Shares or otherwise as
provided herein or, in respect of payments not made on account of Loans or
Letter of Credit Obligations, as designated by the Person making payment when
the payment is made.

     (b) Except as otherwise specifically provided in Section 2.05(c), all
proceeds of Collateral received by the Administrative Agent shall be applied as
follows: (i) first, to pay the principal of all Collateral Agent Advances until
paid in full; (ii) second, ratably to pay all principal amounts then due and
payable with respect to the Revolving A Loans until paid in full; (iii) third,
ratably to pay


                                      -56-

<PAGE>

all principal amounts then due and payable with respect to the Revolving B Loans
until paid in full; (iv) fourth, to pay all principal amounts then due and
payable with respect to the Term Loan until paid in full; (v) fifth, to pay any
other Obligations then due and payable until paid in full; and (vi) sixth, to
the Borrower (to be wired to the Disbursement Account) or such other Person
entitled thereto under applicable law.

     (c) Section 4.04(b) shall not be deemed to apply (i) to any payment by the
Borrower specified by the Borrower to be for the payment of specific Obligations
then due and payable (or prepayable) under any provision of this Agreement or
(ii) after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default.
After the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, all
proceeds of Collateral received by the Administrative Agent shall be applied as
agreed by the Agents and the Lenders.

     (e) [Intentionally omitted]

     Section 4.05 Increased Costs and Reduced Return. (a) If any Lender, any
Agent or the L/C Issuer shall have determined that the adoption or
implementation of after the date hereof, or any change after the date hereof in,
any law, rule, treaty or regulation, or any policy, guideline or directive of,
or any change after the date hereof in, the interpretation or administration
thereof by, any court, central bank or other administrative or Governmental
Authority, or compliance by any Lender, any Agent or the L/C Issuer or any
Person controlling any such Lender, any such Agent or the L/C Issuer with any
directive of, or guideline from, any central bank or other Governmental
Authority or the introduction of, or change in, any accounting principles
applicable to any Lender, any Agent or the L/C Issuer or any Person controlling
any such Lender, any such Agent or the L/C Issuer (in each case, whether or not
having the force of law), shall (i) subject any Lender, any Agent or the L/C
Issuer, or any Person controlling any such Lender, any such Agent or the L/C
Issuer to any tax, duty or other charge with respect to this Agreement or any
Loan made by such Lender or such Agent or any Letter of Credit issued by the L/C

impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar
requirement against any Loan, any Letter of Credit or against assets of or held
by, or deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender,
any Agent or the L/C Issuer or any Person controlling any such Lender, any such
Agent or the L/C Issuer or (iii) impose on any Lender, any Agent or the L/C
Issuer or any Person controlling any such Lender, any such Agent or the L/C
Issuer any other condition regarding this Agreement or any Loan or Letter of
Credit, and the result of any event referred to in clauses (i), (ii) or (iii)
above shall be to increase the actual direct cost to any Lender, any Agent or
the L/C Issuer of making any Loan, issuing, guaranteeing or participating in any
Letter of Credit, or agreeing to make any Loan or issue, guaranty or participate
in any Letter of Credit, or to reduce any amount received or receivable by any
Lender, any Agent or the L/C Issuer hereunder, then, within 15 days of demand by
any such Lender, any such Agent or the L/C Issuer, in accordance with Section
4.05(c) the Borrower shall pay to such Lender, such


                                      -57-

Agent or the L/C Issuer such additional amounts as will compensate such Lender,
such Agent or the L/C Issuer for such increased costs or reductions in amount.

     (b) If any Lender, any Agent or the L/C Issuer shall have determined in
good faith that any change after the date hereof of any Capital Guideline or the
adoption or implementation of, or any change after the date hereof in, any
Capital Guideline by the Governmental Authority charged with the interpretation
or administration thereof, or compliance by any Lender, any Agent or the L/C
Issuer or any Person controlling such Lender, such Agent or the L/C Issuer with
any Capital Guideline or with any request or directive of any such Governmental

not having the force of law), either (i) affects or would affect the amount of
capital required or expected to be maintained by any Lender, any Agent or the
L/C Issuer or any Person controlling such Lender, such Agent or the L/C Issuer,
and any Lender, any Agent or the L/C Issuer determines in good faith that the

Loans made or maintained, Letters of Credit issued or any guaranty or
participation with respect thereto, any Lender's, any Agent's or the L/C
Issuer's or any such other controlling Person's other obligations hereunder, or
(ii) has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on any
Lender's, any Agent's or the L/C Issuer's any such other controlling Person's
capital to a level below that which such Lender, such Agent or the L/C Issuer or
such controlling Person could have achieved but for such circumstances as a
consequence of any Loans made or maintained, Letters of Credit issued, or any
guaranty or participation with respect thereto or any agreement to make Loans,
to issue Letters of Credit or such Lender's, such Agent's or the L/C Issuer's or
such other controlling Person's other obligations hereunder (in each case,
taking into consideration, such Lender's, such Agent's or the L/C Issuer's or
such other controlling Person's policies with respect to capital adequacy),
then, within 15 days of demand by any Lender, any Agent or the L/C Issuer, in
accordance with Section 4.05(c) the Borrower shall pay to such Lender, such
Agent or the L/C Issuer from time to time such additional amounts as will
compensate such Lender, such Agent or the L/C Issuer for such cost of
maintaining such increased capital or such reduction in the rate of return on
such Lender's, such Agent's or the L/C Issuer's or such other controlling
Person's capital.

     (c) All amounts payable under this Section 4.05 shall bear interest from
the date that is 15 days after the date of receipt by the Borrower of the
certificate described in the following sentence delivered by any Lender, any
Agent or the L/C Issuer until payment in full to such Lender, such Agent or the
L/C Issuer at the Reference Rate. A certificate of such Lender, such Agent or

faith by the Borrower, and have been based on assumptions believed by the
Borrower to be reasonable at the time made and upon the best information then

Lien imposed under the IRC or ERISA exists or is likely to arise on account of
any Employee Plan within the meaning of Section 412 of the IRC. Except as set
forth on Schedule 6.01(i), no Loan Party or any of its ERISA Affiliates has
incurred any withdrawal liability under ERISA with respect to any Multiemployer
Plan, or is aware of any facts indicating that it or any of its ERISA Affiliates
may in the future incur any such withdrawal liability. No Loan Party or any of
its ERISA Affiliates nor, to the knowledge of the Borrower, any fiduciary of any
Employee Plan has (A) engaged in a nonexempt prohibited transaction described in

future could reasonably be expected to result in, a Material Adverse Effect.

     (n) Permits, Etc. Each Loan Party has, and is in compliance in all respects
with, all permits, licenses, authorizations, approvals, entitlements and

operate, or to acquire, each business currently owned, leased, managed or
operated, or to be acquired, by such Person, except for such failures to have
any of the foregoing as could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material
Adverse Effect. No condition exists or event has occurred which, in itself or
with the giving of notice or lapse of time or both, would result in the
suspension, revocation, impairment, forfeiture or non-renewal of any such
permit, license, authorization, approval, entitlement or accreditation that is

     (o) Properties. (i) Each Loan Party has good and marketable title to, valid
leasehold interests in, or valid licenses to use, all property and assets (other
than Oil and Gas Properties) material to its business, free and clear of all
Liens, except Permitted Liens. All such properties and assets constituting
personalty are in good working order and condition, ordinary wear and tear
excepted.

             (ii) Part A of Schedule 6.01(o) sets forth a complete and accurate
list, as of the Effective Date, of the location, by state and street address, of
all real property owned or leased by each Loan Party, other than Oil and Gas
Properties. As of the Effective Date, each Loan Party has valid leasehold
interests in the Leases described on Part A of Schedule 6.01(o) to which it is a
party. Part A of Schedule 6.01(o) sets forth with respect to each such Lease
described on Part A of Schedule 6.01(o), the commencement date, termination
date, renewal options (if any) and annual base rents. Each Lease described on
Part A of Schedule 6.01(o) is valid and enforceable in accordance with its terms
in all material respects and is in full force and effect. Except as could not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, to the best knowledge
of any Loan Party, no other party to any Lease described on Part A of Schedule
6.01(o) is in default of its obligations thereunder, and no Loan Party (or any
other party to any such Lease) has at any time delivered or received any notice
of default which remains uncured under any such Lease and, as of the Effective
Date, no event has occurred which, with the giving of notice or the passage of
time or both, would constitute a default under any such Lease.

             (iii) Part B of Schedule 6.01(o) sets forth a complete and accurate
list, as of the Effective Date, of all Oil and Gas Properties consisting of
Proved Reserves whether leased or owned by any Loan Party. The Borrower and its
Subsidiaries each have good and defensible title to all of its Oil and Gas
Properties set forth in Part B of Schedule 6.01(o) which constitute real
property and good title to all of its Oil and Gas Properties which constitute
personal property, except for (A) such imperfections of title which do not in
the aggregate materially detract from the value thereof to, or the use thereof
in, the business of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries and (B) Permitted
Liens. The Initial Reserve Report or each Reserve Report, as the case may be,
includes and describes the entire interest of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries
in such Oil and Gas Properties as of the date of the Initial Reserve Report or
such applicable Reserve Report, as the case may be, and the descriptions are
complete and accurate in all material respects as of the date of the Initial
Reserve Report or such applicable Reserve Report, as the case may be; and there
are no "back-in" or "reversionary" interests held by third parties which could
materially reduce the interest of the Borrower or its Subsidiaries in such Oil
and Gas Properties except as reflected in the Initial Reserve Report or such
applicable Reserve Report, as the case may be. The ownership of the Oil and Gas
Properties by the Borrower and its Subsidiaries shall not in any material
respect obligate any such Loan Party to bear the costs and expenses relating to
the maintenance, development or operations of each such Oil and Gas Property in
an amount in excess of the working interest of such Loan Party in each Oil and
Gas Property set forth in the Initial Reserve Report or the most recent Reserve
Report, as the case may be.

None of the other reports, financial statements, certificates or other
information furnished by or on behalf of any Loan Party to the Agents in
connection with the negotiation of this Agreement or delivered hereunder (as
modified or supplemented by other information so furnished) contains any
material misstatement of fact or omits to state any material fact necessary to
make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which it
was made, not misleading; provided that, with respect to projected financial
information, each Loan Party represents only that such information was prepared
in good faith based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable at the time.

be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect which has not been set forth
in a footnote included in the Financial Statements or a Schedule hereto.

result in a Material Adverse Effect; and (viii) no Loan Party has received any
notification pursuant to any Environmental Laws that (A) any work, repairs,
construction or Capital Expenditures are required to be made in respect as a
condition of continued compliance with any Environmental Laws, or any license,
permit or approval issued pursuant thereto or (B) any license, permit or

                      MANAGEMENT, COLLECTION AND STATUS OF
                    ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND OTHER COLLATERAL

Section 8.01      Collection of Accounts Receivable; Management of Collateral.

     (a) On or prior to the Effective Date, each Loan Party shall assist the
Administrative Agent in (i) establishing, and, during the term of this
Agreement, maintaining one


                                      -97-

<PAGE>

or more lockboxes in the name of the Administrative Agent (collectively, the
"Lockboxes") with one or more financial institutions set forth on Schedule 8.01
or such other financial institutions selected by the Borrower and acceptable to
the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion (each being referred to as a
"Lockbox Bank"), and (ii) establishing, and, during the term of this Agreement,
maintaining an account (a "Collection Account" and, collectively, the
"Collection Accounts") in the name of the Administrative Agent with each Lockbox
Bank. On or prior to the Effective Date, each Loan Party shall irrevocably
instruct its Account Debtors, with respect to Accounts Receivable of such Loan
Party, to remit all payments to be made by checks or other drafts to the
Lockboxes and to remit all payments to be made by wire transfer or by Automated
Clearing House, Inc. payment as directed by the Administrative Agent and shall
instruct each Lockbox Bank to deposit all amounts received in its Lockbox to the
Collection Accounts at such Lockbox Bank on the day received or, if such day is
not a Business Day, on the next succeeding Business Day. Until the
Administrative Agent has advised the Borrower to the contrary, after (x) the
occurrence and during the continuance of a Default or Event of Default or (y)
the date on which the aggregate amount of Qualified Cash and the Revolver A
Availability is less than $5,000,000 (either such event described in clause (x)
or (y), an "Activation Event"), each Loan Party may and will enforce, collect
and receive all amounts owing on the Accounts Receivable of such Loan Party for
the Administrative Agent's benefit and on the Administrative Agent's behalf, but
at such Loan Party's expense; such privilege shall terminate, at the
Administrative Agent's election, during the continuance of an Activation Event.
All checks, drafts, notes, money orders, acceptances, cash and other evidences
of Indebtedness received directly by any Loan Party from any Account Debtor, as
proceeds from Accounts Receivable of any Loan Party, or as proceeds of any other
Collateral, shall be held by such Loan Party in trust for the Agents and the
Lenders and upon receipt be deposited by such Loan Party in original form and no
later than the next Business Day after receipt thereof into a Collection
Account. All proceeds received by any Loan Party in the accounts identified on
Schedule 8.01(a) shall, no later than the next Business Day, be transferred to a
Collection Account. The Borrower shall, and shall cause each other Loan Party
to, use its commercially reasonable efforts to have its customers remit its
checks, drafts, notes, money orders, acceptances, cash or other evidences of
Indebtedness directly to a Collection Account or a Lockbox. None of the Loan
Parties shall commingle such collections with such Loan Party's own funds or the
funds of any Subsidiary or Affiliate of such Loan Party that is not itself a
Loan Party or with the proceeds of any assets not included in the Collateral
other than with funds collected on behalf of third parties representing amounts
attributable to trust fund taxes or Hydrocarbon interests of third Persons. For
so long as the Administrative Agent has not directed funds received in the
Collection Accounts to be sent to the Administrative Agent's Account as set
forth in this Section 8.01(a), each Lockbox Bank shall transfer funds received
in the Collection Accounts to the operating account of the Loan Parties
specified on Schedule 8.01. During the continuance of an Activation Event, the
Administrative Agent may direct that not more than 45% of all funds received in
the Collection Accounts shall be sent by wire transfer or Automated Clearing
House, Inc. ("ACH") payment to the Payment Office to be credited to the
Administrative Agent's Account and applied to the Obligations. The Borrower
shall, on a monthly basis delivery to the Administrative Agent a report (the
"Cash Report") reflecting the actual percentage of ownership by the Loan Parties
of all funds received from the sale of Hydrocarbons deposited into the
Collection Accounts (such percentage, the "Actual Cash Sweep Percentage") and
the aggregate amount of such deposits in the Collection Accounts (including,
without limitation, funds collected on behalf of third parties representing
amounts attributable to


                                      -98-

<PAGE>

trust fund taxes or Hydrocarbon interest of third Persons) (the "Total Collected
Cash"). In the event that the Administrative Agent has directed funds from the
Collection Accounts to the Payment Office to be credited to the Administrative
Agent's Account resulting in funds transferred to such account to be less than
an amount equal to the Total Collected Cash multiplied by the Cash Sweep
Percentage, the Administrative Agent may, in its sole discretion, direct
additional funds equal to such deficiency in the Collection Accounts to be sent
by wire transfer or ACH payment to the Payment Office to be credited to the
Administrative Agent's Account and applied to the Obligations. In the event that
the Administrative Agent has directed funds from the Collection Accounts to the
Payment Office to be credited to the Administrative Agent's Account resulting in
funds transferred to such account to be greater than an amount equal to the
Total Collected Cash multiplied by the Cash Sweep Percentage, the Administrative
Agent, shall upon five (5) Business Days' written request from the Borrower,
remit funds equal to such excess to the Disbursement Account, provided that
before and after giving effect to such remittance, Revolver A Availability shall
not be less than $2,000,000. No checks, drafts, notes, money orders,
acceptances, cash or other instruments received by the Administrative Agent
shall constitute final payment to the Administrative Agent unless and until such
checks, drafts, notes, money orders, acceptances, cash or instruments have
actually been collected.

     (b) After the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default,
the Collateral Agent may send a notice of assignment and/or notice of the
Lenders' security interest to any and all Account Debtors and, thereafter, the
Collateral Agent shall have the sole right to collect the Accounts Receivable
and payment intangibles of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries and/or, to the
extent permitted by applicable law, take possession of the Collateral and the
books and records relating thereto. After the occurrence and during the
continuation of an Event of Default, the Borrower and its Subsidiaries shall
not, without prior written consent of the Collateral Agent, grant any extension
of time of payment of any Account Receivable or payment intangible, compromise
or settle any Account Receivable or payment intangible for less than the full
amount thereof, release, in whole or in part, any Person or property liable for
the payment thereof, or allow any credit or discount whatsoever thereon.

     (c) The Borrower hereby appoints each Agent or its designee on behalf of
such Agent as the Borrower's attorney-in-fact with power exercisable during the
continuance of an Event of Default to (i) endorse any Loan Party's name upon any
notes, acceptances, checks, drafts, money orders or other evidences of payment
relating to the Accounts Receivable or payment intangibles of such Loan Party,
(ii) sign any Loan Party's name on any invoice or bill of lading relating to any
of the Accounts Receivable or payment intangibles of such Loan Party, drafts
against Account Debtors with respect to Accounts Receivable or payment
intangibles of such Loan Party, assignments and verifications of Accounts
Receivable or payment intangibles and notices to Account Debtors with respect to
Accounts Receivable or payment intangibles of such Loan Party, (iii) send
verification of Accounts Receivable of the Loan Parties, and (iv) after the
occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default, notify the Postal
Service authorities to change the address for delivery of mail addressed to the
Loan Parties to such address as such Agent may designate and to do all other
acts and things necessary to carry out this Agreement. All acts of said attorney
or designee are hereby ratified and approved, and said attorney or designee
shall not be liable for any acts of omission or commission (other than acts of
omission or commission constituting gross negligence or willful misconduct as
determined by a final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction), or for any
error of judgment or mistake of


                                      -99-

<PAGE>

fact or law; this power being coupled with an interest is irrevocable until all
of the Loans and other Obligations under the Loan Documents are paid in full and
all of the Commitments are terminated.

     (d) Nothing herein contained shall be construed to constitute any Agent as
agent of any Loan Party for any purpose whatsoever, and the Agents shall not be
responsible or liable for any shortage, discrepancy, damage, loss or destruction
of any part of the Collateral wherever the same may be located and regardless of
the cause thereof (other than from acts of omission or commission constituting
gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a final judgment of a
court of competent jurisdiction). The Agents shall not, under any circumstance
or in any event whatsoever, have any liability for any error or omission or
delay of any kind occurring in the settlement, collection or payment of any of
the Accounts Receivable of the Loan Parties or any instrument received in
payment thereof or for any damage resulting therefrom (other than acts of
omission or commission constituting gross negligence or willful misconduct as
determined by a final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction). The
Agents, by anything herein or in any assignment or otherwise, do not assume any
of the obligations under any contract or agreement assigned to any Agent and
shall not be responsible in any way for the performance by the Loan Parties of
any of the terms and conditions thereof.

     (e) If any Account Receivable of the Loan Parties includes a charge for any
tax payable to any Governmental Authority, each Agent is hereby authorized (but
in no event obligated) in its discretion to pay the amount thereof to the proper
taxing authority for the Borrower's account and to charge the Borrower therefor
provided that such tax is not being disputed by appropriate action. The Borrower
shall notify the Agents if any Account Receivable of the Loan Parties includes
any taxes due to any such Governmental Authority and, in the absence of such
notice, the Agents shall have the right to retain the full proceeds of such
Account Receivable and shall not be liable for any taxes that may be due by
reason of the sale and delivery creating such Account Receivable.

     (f) Notwithstanding any other terms set forth in the Loan Documents, the
rights and remedies of the Agents and the Lenders herein provided, and the
obligations of the Borrower set forth herein, are cumulative of, may be
exercised singly or concurrently with, and are not exclusive of, any other
rights, remedies or obligations set forth in any other Loan Document or as
provided by law.

     Section 8.02 Accounts Receivable Documentation. During the continuance of
an Event of Default, the Borrower shall at such intervals as the Agents may
reasonably require, execute and deliver confirmatory written assignments of the
Accounts Receivable to the Agents and furnish such further schedules and/or
information as any such Agent may require relating to the Accounts Receivable,
including, without limitation, sales invoices or the equivalent, credit memos
issued, remittance advices, reports and copies of deposit slips and copies of
original shipping or delivery receipts for all merchandise sold. In addition,
the Loan Parties shall notify the Agents of any non-compliance in respect of the
representations, warranties and covenants contained in Section 8.03. The items
to be provided under this Section 8.02 are to be in form reasonably satisfactory
to the Agents. The Borrower's failure to give any of such items to the Agents
shall not affect, terminate, modify or otherwise limit the Collateral Agent's
Lien on the Collateral. During the continuance of an Event of Default, the
Borrower shall not re-date any


                                     -100-

<PAGE>

invoice or sale or make sales on extended dating beyond that customary in the
Borrower's industry or consistent with past practice, and shall not re-bill any
material Accounts Receivable without promptly disclosing the same to the Agents
and providing the Agents with a copy of such re-billing, identifying the same as
such.

     Section 8.03 Status of Accounts Receivable and Other Collateral. With
respect to Collateral of any Loan Party at the time the Collateral becomes
subject to the Collateral Agent's Lien, each Loan Party covenants, represents
and warrants: (a) such Loan Party shall be the sole owner, free and clear of all
Liens (except for the Liens granted in the favor of the Collateral Agent for the
benefit of the Lenders and Permitted Liens), and shall be fully authorized to
sell, transfer, pledge and/or grant a security interest in each and every item
of said Collateral; (b) each Account Receivable shall be a good and valid
account representing a bona fide indebtedness incurred by the Account Debtor
therein named, for a fixed sum as set forth in the invoice relating thereto; (c)
no Account Receivable shall be subject to any defense, offset, counterclaim,
discount or allowance except as may be stated in the invoice relating thereto,
discounts and allowances as may be customary in such Loan Party's business and
as otherwise disclosed to the Agents; (d) none of the transactions underlying or
giving rise to any Account Receivable shall violate any applicable state or
federal laws or regulations, and all documents relating thereto shall be legally
sufficient under such laws or regulations and shall be legally enforceable in
accordance with their terms; (e) no agreement under which any deduction or
offset of any kind, other than normal trade discounts, may be granted or shall
have been made by such Loan Party at or before the time such Account Receivable
is created; (f) all agreements, instruments and other documents relating to any
Account Receivable shall be true and correct and in all material respects what
they purport to be; (g) all signatures and endorsements that appear on all
material agreements, instruments and other documents relating to any Account
Receivable shall be genuine and all signatories and endorsers shall have full
capacity to contract; (h) such Loan Party shall maintain books and records
pertaining to said Collateral in such detail, form and scope as the Agents shall
reasonably require; (i) such Loan Party shall immediately notify the Agents if
any Account Receivable arises out of contracts with any Governmental Authority,
and will execute any instruments and take any steps required by the Agents in
order that all monies due or to become due under any such contract shall be
assigned to the Collateral Agent and notice thereof given to such Governmental
Authority under the Federal Assignment of Claims Act or any similar state or
local law; (j) such Loan Party will, immediately upon learning thereof, report
to the Agents any material loss or destruction of, or substantial damage to, any
of the Collateral, and any other matters affecting the value, enforceability or
collectability of any of the Collateral; (k) if any amount payable under or in
connection with any Account Receivable is evidenced by a promissory note or
other instrument, such promissory note or instrument shall be immediately
pledged, endorsed, assigned and delivered to the Collateral Agent for the
benefit of the Lenders as additional Collateral; (l) such Loan Party shall not
re-date any invoice or sale or make sales on extended dating beyond that which
is customary in the ordinary course of its business and in the industry; (m)
such Loan Party shall conduct a physical count of its Inventory at such
intervals as any Agent may request and such Loan Party shall promptly supply the
Agents with a copy of such count accompanied by a report of the value (based on
the lower of cost (on a first in first out basis) and market value) of such
Inventory; and (n) such Loan Party is not and shall not be entitled to pledge
any Agent's or any Lender's credit on any purchases or for any purpose
whatsoever.

continuance of any Default or Event of Default, the Collateral Agent may at any
time and from time to time employ and maintain on the premises of any Loan Party
a custodian selected by the Collateral Agent who shall have full authority to do
all acts necessary to protect the Agents' and the Lenders' interests. Each Loan
Party hereby agrees to, and to cause its Subsidiaries to, cooperate with any
such custodian and to do whatever the Collateral Agent may reasonably request to
preserve the Collateral. All costs and expenses incurred by the Collateral Agent
by reason of the employment of the custodian shall be the responsibility of the
Borrower and charged to the Loan Account.

all accrued and unpaid interest thereon, all fees and all other amounts payable
under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall become due and payable
immediately, without presentment, demand, protest or further notice of any kind,
all of which are hereby expressly waived by each Loan Party and (iii) exercise
any and all of its other rights and remedies under applicable law, hereunder and
under the other Loan Documents; provided, however, that upon the occurrence of
any Event of Default described in subsection (f) or (g) of this Section 9.01,
without any notice to any Loan Party or any other Person or any act by any Agent
or any Lender, all Commitments shall automatically terminate and all Loans and
Reimbursement Obligations then outstanding, together with all accrued and unpaid
interest thereon, all fees and all other amounts due under this Agreement and
the other Loan Documents shall become due and payable automatically and
immediately, without presentment, demand, protest or notice of any kind, all of
which are expressly waived by each Loan Party. Upon demand by the Administrative
Agent after the occurrence and during the continuation of any Event of Default,
the Borrower shall deposit with the Administrative Agent with respect to each
Letter of Credit then outstanding cash in an amount equal to 110% of the
greatest amount for which such Letter of Credit may be drawn. Such deposits
shall be held by the Administrative Agent in the Letter of Credit Collateral
Account as security for, and to provide for the payment of, the Letter of Credit
Obligations.

                                     AGENTS

     Section 10.01 Appointment. Each Lender (and each subsequent maker of any
Loan by its making thereof) hereby irrevocably appoints and authorizes the
Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent to perform the duties of each such
Agent as set forth in this Agreement including: (i) to receive on behalf of each
Lender any payment of principal of or interest on the Loans outstanding
hereunder and all other amounts accrued hereunder for the account of the Lenders
and paid to such Agent, and, subject to Section 2.02 of this Agreement, to
distribute promptly to each Lender its Pro Rata Share of all payments so
received; (ii) to distribute to each Lender copies of all material notices and
agreements received by such Agent and not required to be delivered to each
Lender pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, provided that the Agents shall
not have any liability to the Lenders for any Agent's inadvertent failure to
distribute any such notices or agreements to the Lenders; (iii) to maintain, in
accordance with its customary business practices, ledgers and records reflecting
the status of the Obligations, the Loans, and related matters and to maintain,
in accordance with its customary business practices, ledgers and records
reflecting the status of the Collateral and related matters; (iv) to execute or
file any and all financing or similar statements or notices, amendments,
renewals, supplements, documents, instruments, proofs of claim, notices and
other written agreements with respect to this Agreement or any other Loan
Document; (v) to make the Loans and Collateral Agent Advances, for such Agent or
on behalf of the applicable Lenders as provided in this Agreement or any other
Loan Document; (vi) to perform, exercise, and enforce any and all other rights
and remedies of the Lenders with respect to the Loan Parties, the Obligations,
or otherwise related to any of same to the extent reasonably incidental to the
exercise by such Agent of the rights and remedies specifically authorized to be
exercised by such Agent by the terms of this Agreement or any other Loan
Document; (vii) to incur and pay such fees necessary or appropriate for the
performance and fulfillment of its functions and powers pursuant to this
Agreement or any other Loan Document; and (viii) subject to Section 10.03 of
this Agreement, to take such action as such Agent deems appropriate on its
behalf to administer the Loans and the Loan Documents and to exercise such other
powers delegated to such Agent by the terms hereof or the other Loan Documents
(including, without limitation, the power to give or to refuse to give notices,
waivers, consents, approvals and instructions and the power to make or to refuse
to make determinations and calculations) together with such powers as are
reasonably incidental thereto to carry out the purposes hereof and thereof. As
to any matters not expressly provided for by this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents (including, without limitation, enforcement or collection of the
Loans), the Agents shall not be required to exercise any discretion or take any
action, but shall be required to act or to refrain from acting (and shall be
fully protected in so acting or refraining from acting) upon the instructions of
the Required Lenders, and such instructions of the Required Lenders shall be
binding upon all Lenders and all makers of Loans; provided, however, that the
L/C Issuer shall not be required to refuse to honor a drawing under any Letter
of Credit and the Agents shall not be required to take any action which, in the
reasonable opinion of any Agent, exposes such Agent to liability or which is
contrary to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or applicable law.

     Section 10.02 Nature of Duties. The Agents shall have no duties or
responsibilities except those expressly set forth in this Agreement or in the
other Loan


                                     -106-

<PAGE>

Documents. The duties of the Agents shall be mechanical and administrative in
nature. The Agents shall not have by reason of this Agreement or any other Loan
Document a fiduciary relationship in respect of any Lender. Nothing in this
Agreement or any other Loan Document, express or implied, is intended to or
shall be construed to impose upon the Agents any obligations in respect of this
Agreement or any other Loan Document except as expressly set forth herein or
therein. Each Lender shall make its own independent investigation of the
financial condition and affairs of the Loan Parties in connection with the
making and the continuance of the Loans hereunder and shall make its own
appraisal of the creditworthiness of the Loan Parties and the value of the
Collateral, and the Agents shall have no duty or responsibility, either
initially or on a continuing basis, to provide any Lender with any credit or
other information with respect thereto, whether coming into their possession
before the initial Loan hereunder or at any time or times thereafter, provided
that, upon the reasonable request of a Lender, each Agent shall provide to such
Lender any documents or reports delivered to such Agent by the Loan Parties
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or any other Loan Document. If any Agent
seeks the consent or approval of the Required Lenders to the taking or
refraining from taking any action hereunder, such Agent shall send notice
thereof to each Lender. Each Agent shall promptly notify each Lender any time
that the Required Lenders have instructed such Agent to act or refrain from
acting pursuant hereto.

     Section 10.03 Rights, Exculpation, Etc. The Agents and their directors,
officers, agents or employees shall not be liable to any Lender for any action
taken or omitted to be taken by them under or in connection with this Agreement
or the other Loan Documents, except for their own gross negligence or willful
misconduct as determined by a final judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Agents (i)
may treat the payee of any Loan as the owner thereof until the Collateral Agent
receives written notice of the assignment or transfer thereof, pursuant to
Section 12.07 hereof, signed by such payee and in form satisfactory to the
Collateral Agent; (ii) may consult with legal counsel (including, without
limitation, counsel to any Agent or counsel to the Loan Parties), independent
public accountants, and other experts selected by any of them and shall not be
liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken in good faith by any of them
in accordance with the advice of such counsel or experts; (iii) make no warranty
or representation to any Lender and shall not be responsible to any Lender for
any statements, certificates, warranties or representations made in or in
connection with this Agreement or the other Loan Documents; (iv) shall not have
any duty to any Lender to ascertain or to inquire as to the performance or
observance of any of the terms, covenants or conditions of this Agreement or the
other Loan Documents on the part of any Person, the existence or possible
existence of any Default or Event of Default, or to inspect the Collateral or
other property (including, without limitation, the books and records) of any
Person; (v) shall not be responsible to any Lender for the due execution,
legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of this
Agreement or the other Loan Documents or any other instrument or document
furnished pursuant hereto or thereto; and (vi) shall not be deemed to have made
any representation or warranty regarding the existence, value or collectability
of the Collateral, the existence, priority or perfection of the Collateral
Agent's Lien thereon, or any certificate prepared by any Loan Party in
connection therewith, nor shall the Agents be responsible or liable to the
Lenders for any failure to monitor or maintain any portion of the Collateral.
The Agents shall not be liable to any Lender for any apportionment or
distribution of payments made in good faith pursuant to Section 4.04, and if any
such apportionment or distribution is subsequently determined to have been made
in error the sole recourse of any


                                     -107-

<PAGE>

Lender to whom payment was due but not made, shall be to recover from other
Lenders any payment in excess of the amount which they are determined to be
entitled. The Agents may at any time request instructions from the Lenders with
respect to any actions or approvals which by the terms of this Agreement or of
any of the other Loan Documents the Agents are permitted or required to take or
to grant, and if such instructions are promptly requested, the Agents shall be
absolutely entitled to refrain from taking any action or to withhold any
approval under any of the Loan Documents until they shall have received such
instructions from the Required Lenders. Without limiting the foregoing, no
Lender shall have any right of action whatsoever against any Agent as a result
of such Agent acting or refraining from acting under this Agreement or any of
the other Loan Documents in accordance with the instructions of the Required
Lenders.

     Section 10.04 Reliance. Each Agent shall be entitled to rely upon any
written notices, statements, certificates, orders or other documents or any
telephone message believed by it in good faith to be genuine and correct and to
have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person, and with respect to all
matters pertaining to this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents and its
duties hereunder or thereunder, upon advice of counsel selected by it.

     Section 10.05 Indemnification. To the extent that any Agent, any sub-agent
or other agent appointed by either Agent, or the L/C Issuer is not reimbursed
and indemnified by any Loan Party, the Lenders will reimburse and indemnify such
Agent, any sub-agent or other agent appointed by either Agent, and the L/C
Issuer from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages,
penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses, advances or disbursements
of any kind or nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by, or
asserted against such Agent, any sub-agent or other agent appointed by either
Agent, or the L/C Issuer in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement
or any of the other Loan Documents or any action taken or omitted by such Agent,
any sub-agent or other agent appointed by either Agent, or the L/C Issuer under
this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, in proportion to each
Lender's Pro Rata Share, including, without limitation, advances and
disbursements made pursuant to Section 10.08; provided, however, that no Lender
shall be liable for any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses,
damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses, advances or
disbursements for which there has been a final judicial determination that such
liability resulted from any such Agent's, any sub-agent's or other agent's, or
the L/C Issuer's gross negligence or willful misconduct. The obligations of the
Lenders under this Section 10.05 shall survive the payment in full of the Loans
and the termination of this Agreement.

     Section 10.06 Agents Individually. With respect to its Pro Rata Share of
the Total Commitment hereunder and the Loans made by it, each Agent shall have
and may exercise the same rights and powers hereunder and is subject to the same
obligations and liabilities as and to the extent set forth herein for any other
Lender or maker of a Loan. The terms "Lenders" or "Required Lenders" or any
similar terms shall, unless the context clearly otherwise indicates, include
each Agent in its individual capacity as a Lender or one of the Required
Lenders. Each Agent and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to,
and generally engage in any kind of banking, trust or other business with the
Borrower as if it were not acting as an Agent pursuant hereto without any duty
to account to the other Lenders.

Section 10.07 Successor Agent. (a) Each Agent may resign from the performance of
all its functions and duties hereunder and under the other Loan Documents at any
time by giving at least 30 Business Days prior written notice to the Borrower
and each Lender. Such resignation shall take effect upon the acceptance by a
successor Agent of appointment pursuant to clauses (c) and (d) below or as
otherwise provided below.

     (b) Upon any such notice of resignation or action to remove, the Required
Lenders shall appoint a successor Agent. Upon the acceptance of any appointment
as Agent hereunder by a successor Agent, such successor Agent shall thereupon
succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties
of the retiring Agent, and the retiring Agent shall be discharged from its
duties and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. After
any Agent's resignation or removal hereunder as an Agent, the provisions of this
Article X shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be
taken by it while it was an Agent under this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents.

     (c) If a successor Agent shall not have been so appointed within the thirty
(30) Business Day period referenced in Section 10.07(a), the retiring Agent,
with the consent of the other Agent shall then appoint a successor Agent who
shall serve as an Agent until such time, if any, as the Required Lenders, with
the consent of the other Agent, appoint a successor Agent as provided above.

     Section 10.08 Collateral Matters.

     (a) The Collateral Agent may from time to time make such disbursements and
advances ("Collateral Agent Advances") which the Collateral Agent, in its sole
discretion, deems necessary or desirable to preserve, protect, prepare for sale
or lease or dispose of the Collateral or any portion thereof, to enhance the
likelihood or maximize the amount of repayment by the Borrower of the Loans,
Reimbursement Obligations, Letter of Credit Obligations and other Obligations or
to pay any other amount chargeable to the Borrower pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement, including, without limitation, costs, fees and expenses as described
in Section 12.04. The Collateral Agent Advances shall be repayable on demand and
be secured by the Collateral. The Collateral Agent Advances shall constitute
Obligations hereunder which may be charged to the Loan Account in accordance
with Section 4.02. The Collateral Agent shall notify each Lender and the
Borrower in writing of each such Collateral Agent Advance, which notice shall
include a description of the purpose of such Collateral Agent Advance. Without
limitation to its obligations pursuant to Section 10.05, each Lender agrees that
it shall make available to the Collateral Agent, upon the Collateral Agent's
demand, in Dollars in immediately available funds, the amount equal to such
Lender's Pro Rata Share of each such Collateral Agent Advance. If such funds are
not made available to the Collateral Agent by such Lender, the Collateral Agent
shall be entitled to recover such funds on demand from such Lender, together
with interest thereon for each day from the date such payment was due until the
date such amount is paid to the Collateral Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate for
3 Business Days and thereafter at the Reference Rate.

     (b) The Lenders hereby irrevocably authorize the Collateral Agent, at its
option and in its discretion, to release any Lien granted to or held by the
Collateral Agent upon any Collateral upon termination of the Total Commitment
and payment and satisfaction of all


                                     -109-

<PAGE>

Loans, Reimbursement Obligations, Letter of Credit Obligations, and all other
Obligations which have matured and which the Collateral Agent has been notified
in writing are then due and payable (or if the only remaining Obligations are
Letter of Credit Obligations and such Letter of Credit Obligations have been
collateralized by the deposit with the Administrative Agent of cash in an amount
equal to 110% of the greatest amount for which such Letters of Credit may be
drawn); or constituting property being sold or disposed of in the ordinary
course of any Loan Party's business and in compliance with the terms of this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents; or constituting property in which the
Loan Parties owned no interest at the time the Lien was granted or at any time
thereafter; or if approved, authorized or ratified in writing by the Lenders.
Upon request by the Collateral Agent at any time, the Lenders will confirm in
writing the Collateral Agent's authority to release particular types or items of
Collateral pursuant to this Section 10.08(b).

     (c) Without in any manner limiting the Collateral Agent's authority to act
without any specific or further authorization or consent by the Lenders (as set
forth in Section 10.08(b)), each Lender agrees to confirm in writing, upon
request by the Collateral Agent, the authority to release Collateral conferred
upon the Collateral Agent under Section 10.08(b). Upon (i) receipt by the
Collateral Agent of confirmation from the Lenders of its authority to release
any particular item or types of Collateral, and upon prior written request by
any Loan Party or (ii) prior written request by any Loan Party to release any
item or types of Collateral constituting property being sold or disposed of in
compliance with this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, the Collateral Agent
shall (and is hereby irrevocably authorized by the Lenders to) execute such
documents as may be necessary to evidence the release of the Liens granted to
the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Lenders upon such Collateral;
provided, however, that (i) the Collateral Agent shall not be required to
execute any such document on terms which, in the Collateral Agent's opinion,
would expose the Collateral Agent to liability or create any obligations or
entail any consequence other than the release of such Liens without recourse or
warranty, and (ii) such release shall not in any manner discharge, affect or
impair the Obligations or any Lien upon (or obligations of any Loan Party in
respect of) all interests in the Collateral retained by any Loan Party.

     (d) The Collateral Agent shall have no obligation whatsoever to any Lender
to assure that the Collateral exists or is owned by the Loan Parties or is cared
for, protected or insured or has been encumbered or that the Lien granted to the
Collateral Agent pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document has been
properly or sufficiently or lawfully created, perfected, protected or enforced
or is entitled to any particular priority, or to exercise at all or in any
particular manner or under any duty of care, disclosure or fidelity, or to
continue exercising, any of the rights, authorities and powers granted or
available to the Collateral Agent in this Section 10.08 or in any other Loan
Document, it being understood and agreed that in respect of the Collateral, or
any act, omission or event related thereto, the Collateral Agent may act in any
manner it may deem appropriate, in its sole discretion, given the Collateral
Agent's own interest in the Collateral as one of the Lenders and that the
Collateral Agent shall have no duty or liability whatsoever to any other Lender,
except as otherwise provided herein.

     Section 10.09 Agency for Perfection. Each Agent and each Lender hereby
appoints each other Agent and each other Lender as agent and bailee for the
purpose of


                                     -110-

<PAGE>

perfecting the security interests in and liens upon the Collateral in assets
which, in accordance with Article 9 of the Code, can be perfected only by
possession or control (or where the security interest of a secured party with
possession or control has priority over the security interest of another secured
party) and each Agent and each Lender hereby acknowledges that it holds
possession or control of any such Collateral for the benefit of the Collateral
Agent as secured party. Should any Lender obtain possession or control of any
such Collateral, such Lender shall notify the Collateral Agent thereof, and,
promptly upon the Collateral Agent's request therefor shall deliver possession
or control of such Collateral to the Collateral Agent or in accordance with the
Collateral Agent's instructions. Each Loan Party by its execution and delivery
of this Agreement hereby consents to the foregoing.

this Agreement or any other Loan Document, and no consent to any departure by

     Section 12.05 Right of Set-off. Upon the occurrence and during the
continuance of any Event of Default, any Agent or any Lender may, and is hereby
authorized to, at any time and from time to time, without notice to any Loan
Party (any such notice being expressly waived by the Loan Parties) and to the

<PAGE>

held and other Indebtedness at any time owing by such Agent or such Lender to or
for the credit or the account of any Loan Party against any and all obligations
of the Loan Parties either now or hereafter existing under any Loan Document,
irrespective of whether or not such Agent or such Lender shall have made any
demand hereunder or thereunder and although such obligations may be contingent
or unmatured. Each Agent and each Lender agrees to notify such Loan Party
promptly after any such set-off and application made by such Agent or such
Lender provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the
validity of such set-off and application. The rights of the Agents and the
Lenders under this Section 12.05 are in addition to the other rights and
remedies (including other rights of set-off) which the Agents and the Lenders
may have under this Agreement or any other Loan Documents of law or otherwise.

     Section 12.06 Severability. Any provision of this Agreement which is
prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction,
be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without
invalidating the remaining portions hereof or affecting the validity or
enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction.

     Section 12.07 Assignments and Participations. (a) This Agreement and the
other Loan Documents shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of each Loan
Party and each Agent and each Lender and their respective successors and
assigns; provided, however, that none of the Loan Parties may assign or transfer
any of its rights hereunder without the prior written consent of each Lender and
any such assignment without the Lenders' prior written consent shall be null and
void.

     (b) Each Lender may, with the written consent of the Collateral Agent,
assign to one or more Eligible Assignees all or a portion of its rights and
obligations under this Agreement (including, without limitation, all or a
portion of its Commitments, the Loans made by it and its Pro Rata Share of
Letter of Credit Obligations); provided, however, that (i) such assignment is in
an amount which is at least $5,000,000 or a multiple of $1,000,000 in excess
thereof (or the remainder of such Lender's Commitment) (except such minimum
amount shall not apply to an assignment by a Lender to an Affiliate of such
Lender or a Related Fund), (ii) the parties to each such assignment shall
execute and deliver to the Collateral Agent, for its acceptance, an Assignment
and Acceptance, together with any promissory note subject to such assignment and
such parties shall deliver to the Collateral Agent a processing and recordation
fee of $5,000 (except the payment of such fee shall not be required in
connection with an assignment by a Lender to an Affiliate of such Lender or a
Related Fund), and (iii) no written consent of the Collateral Agent shall be
required in connection with any assignment by a Lender to an Affiliate of such
Lender or a Related Fund. Upon such execution, delivery and acceptance, from and
after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Acceptance, which
effective date shall be at least 3 Business Days after the delivery thereof to
the Collateral Agent (or such shorter period as shall be agreed to by the
Collateral Agent and the parties to such assignment), (A) the assignee
thereunder shall become a "Lender" hereunder and, in addition to the rights and
obligations hereunder held by it immediately prior to such effective date, have
the rights and obligations hereunder that have been assigned to it pursuant to
such Assignment and Acceptance and (B) the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to
the extent that rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned by it
pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance, relinquish its rights and be
released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an
Assignment and Acceptance


                                     -115-

<PAGE>

covering all or the remaining portion of an assigning Lender's rights and
obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto).

             (i) By executing and delivering an Assignment and Acceptance, the
assigning Lender and the assignee thereunder confirm to and agree with each
other and the other parties hereto as follows: (A) other than as provided in
such Assignment and Acceptance, the assigning Lender makes no representation or
warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to any statements,
warranties or representations made in or in connection with this Agreement or
any other Loan Document or the execution, legality, validity, enforceability,
genuineness, sufficiency or value of this Agreement or any other Loan Document
furnished pursuant hereto; (B) the assigning Lender makes no representation or
warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to the financial condition
of any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries or the performance or observance by
any Loan Party of any of its obligations under this Agreement or any other Loan
Document furnished pursuant hereto; (C) such assignee confirms that it has
received a copy of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, together with
such other documents and information it has deemed appropriate to make its own
credit analysis and decision to enter into such Assignment and Acceptance; (D)
such assignee will, independently and without reliance upon the assigning
Lender, any Agent or any Lender and based on such documents and information as
it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions
in taking or not taking action under this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents; (E) such assignee appoints and authorizes the Agents to take such
action as agents on its behalf and to exercise such powers under this Agreement
and the other Loan Documents as are delegated to the Agents by the terms hereof
and thereof, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental hereto and
thereto; and (F) such assignee agrees that it will perform in accordance with
their terms all of the obligations which by the terms of this Agreement and the
other Loan Documents are required to be performed by it as a Lender.

             (ii) The Collateral Agent shall, on behalf of the Borrower,
maintain, or cause to be maintained at the Payment Office, a copy of each
Assignment and Acceptance delivered to and accepted by it and a register (the
"Register") for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders and
the Commitments of, and principal amount of the Loans and Letter of Credit
Obligations (the "Registered Loans") owing to each Lender from time to time. The
entries in the Register shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent
manifest error, and the Borrower, the Agents and the Lenders may treat each
Person whose name is recorded in the Register as a Lender hereunder for all
purposes of this Agreement. The Register shall be available for inspection by
the Borrower and any Lender at any reasonable time and from time to time upon
reasonable prior notice. In the case of any assignment not reflected in the
Register, the assigning Lender shall maintain a comparable register.

             (iii) Upon its receipt of an Assignment and Acceptance executed by
an assigning Lender and an assignee, together with any promissory notes subject
to such assignment, the Collateral Agent shall, if the Collateral Agent consents
to such assignment and if such Assignment and Acceptance has been completed (i)
accept such Assignment and Acceptance and (ii) record the information contained
therein in the Register.

             (iv) A Registered Loan (and the registered note, if any, evidencing
the same) may be assigned or sold in whole or in part only by registration of
such


                                     -116-

<PAGE>

assignment or sale on the Register (and each registered note shall expressly so
provide). Any assignment or sale of all or part of such Registered Loan (and the
registered note, if any, evidencing the same) may be effected only by
registration of such assignment or sale on the Register, together with the
surrender of the registered note, if any, evidencing the same duly endorsed by
(or accompanied by a written instrument of assignment or sale duly executed by)
the holder of such registered note, whereupon, at the request of the designated
assignee(s) or transferee(s), one or more new registered notes in the same
aggregate principal amount shall be issued to the designated assignee(s) or
transferee(s). Prior to the registration of assignment or sale of any Registered
Loan (and the registered note, if any, evidencing the same), the Agents shall
treat the Person in whose name such Registered Loan (and the registered note, if
any, evidencing the same) is registered as the owner thereof for the purpose of
receiving all payments thereon and for all other purposes, notwithstanding
notice to the contrary.

             (v) In the event that any Lender sells participations in a
Registered Loan, such Lender shall maintain a register on which it enters the
name of all participants in the Registered Loans held by it (the "Participant
Register"). A Registered Loan (and the registered note, if any, evidencing the
same) may be participated in whole or in part only by registration of such
participation on the Participant Register (and each registered note shall
expressly so provide). Any participation of such Registered Loan (and the
registered note, if any, evidencing the same) may be effected only by the
registration of such participation on the Participant Register.

             (vi) Any foreign Person who purchases or is assigned or
participates in any portion of such Registered Loan shall provide the Agents (in
the case of a purchase or assignment) or the Lender (in the case of a
participation) with a completed Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN
(Certificate of Foreign Status) or a substantially similar form for such
purchaser, participant or any other affiliate who is a holder of beneficial
interests in the Registered Loan.

     (c) Each Lender may sell participations to one or more banks or other
entities in or to all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents (including, without limitation, all or a
portion of its Commitments, the Loans made by it and its Pro Rata Share of the
Letter of Credit Obligations); provided, that (i) such Lender's obligations
under this Agreement (including without limitation, its Commitments hereunder)
and the other Loan Documents shall remain unchanged; (ii) such Lender shall
remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of
such obligations, and the Borrower, the Agents and the other Lenders shall
continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such
Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents; and (iii) a participant shall not be entitled to require such Lender
to take or omit to take any action hereunder except (A) action directly
effecting an extension of the maturity dates or decrease in the principal amount
of the Loans or Letter of Credit Obligations, (B) action directly effecting an
extension of the due dates or a decrease in the rate of interest payable on the
Loans or the fees payable under this Agreement, or (C) actions directly
effecting a release of all or a substantial portion of the Collateral or any
Loan Party (except as set forth in Section 10.08 of this Agreement or any other
Loan Document). The Loan Parties agree that each participant shall be entitled
to the benefits of Section 2.08 and Section 4.05 of this Agreement


                                     -117-

<PAGE>

with respect to its participation in any portion of the Commitments and the
Loans as if it was a Lender.

     Section 12.08 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts and by different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of
which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which taken together shall
constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery of an executed counterpart of
this Agreement by telefacsimile shall be equally as effective as delivery of an
original executed counterpart of this Agreement. Any party delivering an
executed counterpart of this Agreement by telefacsimile also shall deliver an
original executed counterpart of this Agreement but the failure to deliver an
original executed counterpart shall not affect the validity, enforceability, and
binding effect of this Agreement. The foregoing shall apply to each other Loan
Document mutatis mutandis.

     Section 12.09 GOVERNING LAW. THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS
(UNLESS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED TO THE CONTRARY IN ANOTHER LOAN DOCUMENT IN RESPECT
OF SUCH OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT) SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE
WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK APPLICABLE TO CONTRACTS MADE AND TO BE
PERFORMED IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

     Section 12.10 CONSENT TO JURISDICTION; SERVICE OF PROCESS AND VENUE. ANY
LEGAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING WITH RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN
DOCUMENT MAY BE BROUGHT IN THE COURTS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK IN THE COUNTY OF
NEW YORK OR OF THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW
YORK, AND, BY EXECUTION AND DELIVERY OF THIS AGREEMENT, THE BORROWER HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY ACCEPTS IN RESPECT OF ITS PROPERTY, GENERALLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY,
THE JURISDICTION OF THE AFORESAID COURTS. THE BORROWER HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
CONSENTS TO THE SERVICE OF ANY AND ALL LEGAL PROCESS, SUMMONS, NOTICES, AND
DOCUMENTS IN ANY SUIT, ACTION, OR PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN THE UNITED STATES OF
AMERICA ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE OTHER
LOAN DOCUMENTS BY THE MAILING (BY REGISTERED MAIL OR CERTIFIED MAIL, POSTAGE
PREPAID) OR DELIVERING OF A COPY OF SUCH PROCESS TO THE BORROWER, AT THE
BORROWER'S ADDRESS FOR NOTICES AS SET FORTH IN SECTION 12.01. THE BORROWER
AGREES THAT A FINAL JUDGMENT IN ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING SHALL BE
CONCLUSIVE AND MAY BE ENFORCED IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS BY SUIT ON THE JUDGMENT OR
IN ANY OTHER MANNER PROVIDED BY LAW. NOTHING HEREIN SHALL AFFECT THE RIGHT OF
THE AGENTS AND THE LENDERS TO SERVE PROCESS IN ANY OTHER MANNER PERMITTED BY LAW
OR TO COMMENCE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS OR OTHERWISE PROCEED AGAINST THE BORROWER IN
ANY OTHER JURISDICTION. THE BORROWER HEREBY EXPRESSLY AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO
THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY OBJECTION WHICH IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER
HAVE TO THE JURISDICTION OR LAYING OF VENUE OF ANY SUCH LITIGATION BROUGHT IN
ANY SUCH COURT REFERRED TO ABOVE AND ANY CLAIM THAT ANY SUCH LITIGATION HAS BEEN
BROUGHT IN AN INCONVENIENT FORUM. TO THE EXTENT THAT THE


                                     -118-

<PAGE>

BORROWER HAS OR HEREAFTER MAY ACQUIRE ANY IMMUNITY FROM JURISDICTION OF ANY
COURT OR FROM ANY LEGAL PROCESS (WHETHER THROUGH SERVICE OR NOTICE, ATTACHMENT
PRIOR TO JUDGMENT, ATTACHMENT IN AID OF EXECUTION OR OTHERWISE) WITH RESPECT TO
ITSELF OR ITS PROPERTY, THE BORROWER HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES SUCH IMMUNITY IN
RESPECT OF ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS.

     Section 12.11 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL, ETC. THE BORROWER, EACH AGENT AND EACH
LENDER HEREBY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR
COUNTERCLAIM CONCERNING ANY RIGHTS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR THE OTHER LOAN
DOCUMENTS, OR UNDER ANY AMENDMENT, WAIVER, CONSENT, INSTRUMENT, DOCUMENT OR
OTHER AGREEMENT DELIVERED OR WHICH IN THE FUTURE MAY BE DELIVERED IN CONNECTION
THEREWITH, OR ARISING FROM ANY FINANCING RELATIONSHIP EXISTING IN CONNECTION
WITH THIS AGREEMENT, AND AGREES THAT ANY SUCH ACTION, PROCEEDINGS OR
COUNTERCLAIM SHALL BE TRIED BEFORE A COURT AND NOT BEFORE A JURY. THE BORROWER
CERTIFIES THAT NO OFFICER, REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY AGENT OR ANY
LENDER HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT ANY AGENT OR ANY LENDER
WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM, SEEK TO
ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVERS. THE BORROWER HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THIS
PROVISION IS A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT FOR THE AGENTS AND THE LENDERS ENTERING INTO
THIS AGREEMENT.

     Section 12.12 Consent by the Agents and Lenders. Except as otherwise
expressly set forth herein to the contrary, if the consent, approval,
satisfaction, determination, judgment, acceptance or similar action (an
"Action") of any Agent or any Lender shall be permitted or required pursuant to
any provision hereof or any provision of any other agreement to which any Loan
Party is a party and to which any Agent or any Lender has succeeded thereto,
such Action shall be required to be in writing and may be withheld or denied by
such Agent or such Lender, in its sole discretion, with or without any reason,
and without being subject to question or challenge on the grounds that such
Action was not taken in good faith.

     Section 12.13 No Party Deemed Drafter. Each of the parties hereto agrees
that no party hereto shall be deemed to be the drafter of this Agreement.

     Section 12.14 Reinstatement; Certain Payments. If any claim is ever made
upon any Agent, any Lender or the L/C Issuer for repayment or recovery of any
amount or amounts received by such Agent, such Lender or the L/C Issuer in
payment or on account of any of the Obligations, such Agent, such Lender or the
L/C Issuer shall give prompt notice of such claim to each other Agent and Lender
and the Borrower, and if such Agent, such Lender or the L/C Issuer repays all or
part of such amount by reason of (i) any judgment, decree or order of any court
or administrative body having jurisdiction over such Agent, such Lender or the
L/C Issuer or any of its property, or (ii) any good faith settlement or
compromise of any such claim effected by such Agent, such Lender or the L/C
Issuer with any such claimant, then and in such event each Loan Party agrees
that (A) any such judgment, decree, order, settlement or


                                     -119-

<PAGE>

compromise shall be binding upon it notwithstanding the cancellation of any
Indebtedness hereunder or under the other Loan Documents or the termination of
this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, and (B) it shall be and remain
liable to such Agent, such Lender or the L/C Issuer hereunder for the amount so
repaid or recovered to the same extent as if such amount had never originally
been received by such Agent, such Lender or the L/C Issuer.

     Section 12.15 Indemnification.

     (a) General Indemnity. In addition to the Borrower's other Obligations
under this Agreement, the Borrower agrees to, jointly and severally, defend,
protect, indemnify and hold harmless each Agent, each Lender and the L/C Issuer
and all of their respective officers, directors, employees, attorneys,
consultants and agents (collectively called the "Indemnitees") from and against
any and all losses, damages, liabilities, obligations, penalties, fees,
reasonable costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable
attorneys' fees, costs and expenses) incurred by such Indemnitees, whether prior
to or from and after the Effective Date, whether direct, indirect or
consequential, as a result of or arising from or relating to or in connection
with any of the following: (i) the negotiation, preparation, execution or
performance or enforcement of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or of any
other document executed in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (ii) any Agent's or any Lender's furnishing of funds to the Borrower
or the L/C Issuer's issuing of Letters of Credit for the account of the Borrower
under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, including, without limitation,
the management of any such Loans, the Reimbursement Obligations or the Letter of
Credit Obligations, (iii) any matter relating to the financing transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the other Loan Documents or by any document
executed in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
the other Loan Documents, or (iv) any claim, litigation, investigation or
proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether or not any Indemnitee is a
party thereto (collectively, the "Indemnified Matters"); provided, however, that
the Borrower shall not have any obligation to any Indemnitee under this Section
12.15(a) for any Indemnified Matter caused by or attributable to the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee, as determined by a final
judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction.

     (b) Environmental Indemnity. Without limiting Section 12.15(a) hereof, the
Borrower agrees to, jointly and severally, defend, indemnify, and hold harmless
the Indemnitees against any and all Environmental Liabilities and Costs and all
other claims, demands, penalties, fines, liability (including strict liability),
losses, damages, costs and expenses (including without limitation, reasonable
legal fees and expenses, consultant fees and laboratory fees), arising out of
(i) any Releases or threatened Releases (x) at any property presently or
formerly owned or operated by any Loan Party or any Subsidiary of any Loan
Party, or any predecessor in interest, or (y) of any Hazardous Materials
generated and disposed of by any Loan Party or any Subsidiary of any Loan Party,
or any predecessor in interest; (ii) any violations of Environmental Laws by any
Loan Party or any Subsidiary of any Loan Party, or any predecessor in interest;
(iii) any Environmental Action relating to any Loan Party or any Subsidiary of
any Loan Party, or any predecessor in interest; (iv) any personal injury
(including wrongful death) or property damage (real or personal) arising out of
exposure to Hazardous Materials used, handled, generated, transported or
disposed by any Loan Party or any Subsidiary of any Loan Party, or any
predecessor in interest; and (v) any breach of any warranty or representation
regarding


                                     -120-

<PAGE>

environmental matters made by the Borrower in Section 6.01(r) or the breach of
any covenant made by the Borrower in Section 7.01(j). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Borrower shall not have any obligation to any Indemnitee under
this subsection (b) regarding any potential environmental matter covered
hereunder which is caused by or attributable to the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of such Indemnitee, as determined by a final judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction.

     (c) The indemnification for all of the foregoing losses, damages, fees,
costs and expenses of the Indemnitees are chargeable against the Loan Account.
To the extent that the undertaking to indemnify, pay and hold harmless set forth
in this Section 12.15 may be unenforceable because it is violative of any law or
public policy, the Borrower shall contribute the maximum portion which it is
permitted to pay and satisfy under applicable law, to the payment and
satisfaction of all Indemnified Matters incurred by the Indemnitees. The
indemnities set forth in this Section 12.15 shall survive the repayment of the
Obligations and discharge of any Liens granted under the Loan Documents.

     Section 12.16 Records. The unpaid principal of and interest on the Loans,
the interest rate or rates applicable to such unpaid principal and interest, the
duration of such applicability, the Commitments, and the accrued and unpaid fees
payable pursuant to the Fee Letter and Section 2.06 hereof, and the Letter of
Credit Fees, shall at all times be ascertained from the records of the Agents,
which shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error.

     Section 12.17 Binding Effect. This Agreement shall become effective when it
shall have been executed by the Borrower, each Agent and each Lender and
thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of each Loan Party,
each Agent and each Lender, and their respective successors and assigns, except
that the Loan Parties shall not have the right to assign their rights hereunder
or any interest herein without the prior written consent of each Lender, and any
assignment by any Lender shall be governed by Section 12.07 hereof.

     Section 12.18 Interest. It is the intention of the parties hereto that each
Agent and each Lender shall conform strictly to usury laws applicable to it.
Accordingly, if the transactions contemplated hereby or by any other Loan
Document would be usurious as to any Agent or any Lender under laws applicable
to it (including the laws of the United States of America and the State of New
York or any other jurisdiction whose laws may be mandatorily applicable to such
Agent or such Lender notwithstanding the other provisions of this Agreement),
then, in that event, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement
or any other Loan Document or any agreement entered into in connection with or
as security for the Obligations, it is agreed as follows: (i) the aggregate of
all consideration which constitutes interest under law applicable to any Agent
or any Lender that is contracted for, taken, reserved, charged or received by
such Agent or such Lender under this Agreement or any other Loan Document or
agreements or otherwise in connection with the Obligations shall under no
circumstances exceed the maximum amount allowed by such applicable law, any
excess shall be canceled automatically and if theretofore paid shall be credited
by such Agent or such Lender on the principal amount of the Obligations (or, to
the extent that the principal amount of the Obligations shall have been or would
thereby be paid in full, refunded by such Agent or such Lender, as applicable,
to the Borrower); and (ii) in the event that the maturity of the Obligations is
accelerated by reason of any Event of Default under this Agreement or otherwise,
or in the


                                     -121-

<PAGE>

event of any required or permitted prepayment, then such consideration that
constitutes interest under law applicable to any Agent or any Lender may never
include more than the maximum amount allowed by such applicable law, and excess
interest, if any, provided for in this Agreement or otherwise shall be canceled
automatically by such Agent or such Lender, as applicable, as of the date of
such acceleration or prepayment and, if theretofore paid, shall be credited by
such Agent or such Lender, as applicable, on the principal amount of the
Obligations (or, to the extent that the principal amount of the Obligations
shall have been or would thereby be paid in full, refunded by such Agent or such
Lender to the Borrower). All sums paid or agreed to be paid to any Agent or any
Lender for the use, forbearance or detention of sums due hereunder shall, to the
extent permitted by law applicable to such Agent or such Lender, be amortized,
prorated, allocated and spread throughout the full term of the Loans until
payment in full so that the rate or amount of interest on account of any Loans
hereunder does not exceed the maximum amount allowed by such applicable law. If
at an time and from time to time (i) the amount of interest payable to any Agent
or any Lender on any date shall be computed at the Highest Lawful Rate
applicable to such Agent or such Lender pursuant to this Section 12.18 and (ii)
in respect of any subsequent interest computation period the amount of interest
otherwise payable to such Agent or such Lender would be less than the amount of
interest payable to such Agent or such Lender computed at the Highest Lawful
Rate applicable to such Agent or such Lender, then the amount of interest
payable to such Agent or such Lender in respect of such subsequent interest
computation period shall continue to be computed at the Highest Lawful Rate
applicable to such Agent or such Lender until the total amount of interest
payable to such Agent or such Lender shall equal the total amount of interest
which would have been payable to such Agent or such Lender if the total amount
of interest had been computed without giving effect to this Section 12.18.

     For purposes of this Section 12.18, the term "applicable law" shall mean
that law in effect from time to time and applicable to the loan transaction
between the Borrower, on the one hand, and the Agents and the Lenders, on the
other, that lawfully permits the charging and collection of the highest
permissible, lawful non-usurious rate of interest on such loan transaction and
this Agreement, including laws of the State of New York and, to the extent
controlling, laws of the United States of America.

     The right to accelerate the maturity of the Obligations does not include
the right to accelerate any interest that has not accrued as of the date of
acceleration.

     Section 12.19 Confidentiality. Each Agent and each Lender agrees (on behalf
of itself and each of its affiliates, directors, officers, employees and
representatives) to use reasonable precautions to keep confidential, in
accordance with its customary procedures for handling confidential information
of this nature and in accordance with safe and sound practices of comparable
commercial finance companies, any material non-public information supplied to it
by the Loan Parties pursuant to this Agreement or the other Loan Documents (and
which at the time is not, and does not thereafter become, publicly available or
available to such Person from another source not known to be subject to a
confidentiality obligation to such Person not to disclose such information),
provided that nothing herein shall limit the disclosure of any such information
(i) to the extent required by statute, rule, regulation or judicial process,
(ii) to counsel for any Agent or any Lender, (iii) to examiners or
Securitization Parties or to the auditors or accountants of any Agent or Lender,
(iv) in connection with any litigation to which


                                     -122-

<PAGE>

any Agent or any Lender is a party or (v) to any assignee or participant (or
prospective assignee or participant) so long as such assignee or participant (or
prospective assignee or participant) first agrees, in writing, to be bound by
confidentiality provisions similar in substance to this Section 12.19. Each
Agent and each Lender agrees that, upon receipt of a request or identification
of the requirement for disclosure pursuant to clause (iv) hereof, it will make
reasonable efforts to keep the Loan Parties informed of such request or
identification; provided that the each Loan Party acknowledges that each Agent
and each Lender may make disclosure as required or requested by any Governmental
Authority or representative thereof and that each Agent and each Lender may be

     Section 12.21 No Novation. This Agreement does not extinguish the
obligations for the payment of money outstanding under the Existing Credit
Agreement or discharge or release the obligations or the liens or priority of
any mortgage, pledge, security agreement or any other security therefor. Nothing
herein contained shall be construed as a novation of the obligations outstanding
under the Existing Credit Agreement or instruments securing the same, which
shall remain in full force and effect, except as modified hereby or by
instruments executed concurrently herewith. Nothing expressed or implied in this
Agreement shall be construed as a release or other discharge of the Borrower,
any Guarantor or any other Loan Party from any of its obligations or liabilities
under the Existing Credit Agreement or any of the security agreements, pledge
agreements, mortgages, guaranties or other loan documents executed in connection
therewith, except as amended hereby and by the other Loan Documents. The
Borrower and each other Loan Party hereby (i) confirms and agrees that each Loan
Document to which it is a party is, and shall continue to be, in full force and
effect and is hereby ratified and confirmed in all respects except that on and
after the Effective Date all references in any such Loan Document to "the Credit
Agreement", "thereto", "thereof", "thereunder" or words of like import referring
to the Existing Credit Agreement shall mean the Existing Credit Agreement as
amended and restated by this Agreement; and (ii) confirms and agrees that to the
extent that any such Loan Document purports to assign or pledge to the
Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Lenders, or to grant to the Collateral
Agent for the benefit of the Lenders a security interest in or lien on, any
collateral as security for the Obligations of the Borrower, the Guarantors or
any other Loan Party from time to time existing in respect of the Existing
Credit Agreement and the Loan Documents, such pledge, assignment and/or grant of
the security interest or lien is hereby ratified and confirmed in all respects.
