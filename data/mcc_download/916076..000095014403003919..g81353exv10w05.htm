has been a Payment, or such earlier time as is requested by the Company. In
the event that the Accounting Firm is serving as accountant or auditor for the
individual, entity or group effecting the Change of Control, or is unwilling or
unable to perform its obligations pursuant to this Section&nbsp;4, the Employee
shall appoint another nationally recognized accounting firm to make the
determinations required hereunder (which accounting firm shall then be referred

initial determination by the Accounting Firm hereunder, it is possible that
Gross-Up Payments which will not have been made by the Company should have been

a Change of Control, under any termination or severance policy of the Company
other than this Agreement, so long as all payments are made, and benefits
provided, to the Employee pursuant to Sections&nbsp;3(a) and (b)&nbsp;herein. To the

to Section&nbsp;3(b) is fulfilled, the period in which such medical benefits are
provided shall be credited towards the continued health care coverage required
to be offered to the Employee by COBRA, to the extent allowable under COBRA and
the regulations promulgated thereunder. In the event that no payment or
benefits are required pursuant to Sections&nbsp;3(a) and (b), the Employee rescinds
any such waiver and release. Except for payments provided pursuant to the
Company&#146;s formal severance policy, if any, the benefits and payments to be
provided by this Agreement will not reduce or eliminate any benefits or
payments of any kind whatsoever that are to be provided to the Employee,
including but not limited to, under any vacation policy, defined benefit
retirement plan, defined contribution retirement plan, and the Company&#146;s
