STRONG PROFIT TURNAROUND BY RG&E

Johannesburg, 12 February 2003 - Randgold & Exploration today posted a net
profit of R375.8 million for the 12 months to December against a loss of R70
million for the preceding year. Over the same period its net asset value per
share doubled to R40, reflecting the strong surge in the value of its holdings
in various gold mining ventures, notably Randgold Resources.

"The Randgold group's prime focus has always been on shareholder value and in
2002 we delivered this big time," chairman Roger Kebble said.

"What is particularly satisfying is that Randgold Resources' strong showing is
attributable at least in part to its successful Nasdaq listing last year, which
significantly improved its share tradeability and liquidity. The high-grade
bonanza at Morila and the improvement in the gold price were obviously also
factors, but I think we can claim a substantial chunk of the credit for the
elegant and effective way in which we dealt with what had been a negative
structural issue in the group."

Kebble said while the size, in percentage terms, of RG&E's holding in Randgold
Resources had been reduced by the Nasdaq listing, this had been more than offset
by the subsequent increase in its value.

"Our commitment to value and our confidence in Randgold Resources' upside
potential have been more than justified by this strategic decision," he said.
