Ladies and Gentlemen:

         The undersigned, Watsco, Inc., a Florida corporation (the "Company"),
is a party with you to that certain Private Shelf Agreement, dated as of January
31, 2000 (as amended, modified or supplemented from time to time, the "2000
Agreement"), pursuant to which the Company has issued Notes. The Company has
requested and you have agreed (on the terms and subject to the conditions
hereinafter set forth) to amend and restate the 2000 Agreement in its entirety
as set forth herein.

         NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the covenants and agreements herein
contained, the parties hereto hereby agree that the 2000 Agreement shall be and
hereby is amended and restated effective as of the date hereof to read in its
entirety as follows:

         1.   PRELIMINARY STATEMENTS.

         1A.Authorization and Issue of Series A Notes. The Company has
authorized and issued Senior Series A Notes in the aggregate principal amount of
$30,000,000, dated February 7, 2001 to mature April 9, 2007 and bearing interest
at 7.07% per annum on the unpaid balance thereof from the date thereof until the
principal thereof shall have become due and payable (the "Issued Series A
Notes"). The Company will authorize and agree to execute an Allonge, in
substantially the form of Exhibit A-1 (each an "Allonge"), for each Issued
Series A Note issued and outstanding as of the date hereof. The terms "Issued
Series A Note" and "Issued Series A Notes" as used herein shall include each
Issued Series A Note previously delivered pursuant to

<PAGE>

the 2000 Agreement, as amended by such Allonge, and any such Note delivered in
substitution or exchange therefor.

         1B. Authorization of Issue of Notes. The Company may authorize the
issue of its senior unsecured promissory notes (the "Shelf Notes") in the
aggregate principal amount of up to $125,000,000, to be dated the date of issue
thereof, to mature, in the case of each Shelf Note so issued, no more than
twelve years after the date of original issuance thereof, to have an average
life, in the case of each Shelf Note so issued, of no more than ten years after
the date of original issuance thereof, to bear interest on the unpaid balance
thereof from the date thereof at the rate per annum, and to have such other
particular terms, as shall be set forth, in the case of each Shelf Note so
issued, in the Confirmation of Acceptance with respect to such Shelf Note
delivered pursuant to paragraph 2G, and to be substantially in the form of
Exhibit A-2 attached hereto. The terms "Shelf Note" and "Shelf Notes" as used
herein shall include each Issued Series A Note and each Shelf Note delivered
pursuant to any provision of this Agreement and each Shelf Note delivered in
substitution or exchange for any such Shelf Note pursuant to any such provision.
The terms "Note" and "Notes" as used herein shall include each Issued Series A
Note and each Shelf Note delivered pursuant to any provision of this Agreement
and each Note delivered in substitution or exchange for any such Note pursuant
to any such provision. Notes which have (i) the same final maturity, (ii) the
same principal prepayment dates, (iii) the same principal prepayment amounts (as
a percentage of the original principal amount of each Note), (iv) the same
interest rate, (v) the same interest payment periods and (vi) the same date of
issuance (which, in the case of a Note issued in exchange for another Note,
shall be deemed for these purposes the date on which such Note's ultimate
predecessor Note was issued), are herein called a "Series" of Notes.

         2. PURCHASE AND SALE OF NOTES.

         2A.Purchase and Sale of Issued Notes. On February 7, 2001, the Company
sold to you the Issued Series A Notes in the aggregate principal amount of
$30,000,000. The Company hereby agrees to execute and deliver to you and,
subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth, you agree to accept from
the Company, for each Issued Series A Note, an Allonge, in substantially the
form of Exhibit A-1.

         2B.Purchase and Sale of Shelf Notes.

         2B(1) Facility. Prudential is willing to consider, in its sole
discretion and within limits which may be authorized for purchase by Prudential
and Prudential Affiliates from time to time, the purchase of Shelf Notes
pursuant to this Agreement. The willingness of Prudential to consider such
purchase of Shelf Notes is herein called the "Facility". At any time, the
aggregate principal amount of Shelf Notes stated in paragraph 1B, minus the
aggregate principal amount of Shelf Notes purchased and sold pursuant to this
Agreement prior to such time, minus the aggregate principal amount of Accepted
Notes (as hereinafter defined) which have not yet been purchased and sold
hereunder prior to such time, plus the aggregate principal amount of Shelf Notes
purchased and sold pursuant to this Agreement and thereafter retired prior to
such time is herein called the "Available Facility Amount" at such time.
NOTWITHSTANDING THE WILLINGNESS OF PRUDENTIAL TO CONSIDER PURCHASES OF SHELF
NOTES, THIS AGREEMENT IS ENTERED INTO ON THE EXPRESS UNDERSTANDING THAT

                                        2

<PAGE>

NEITHER PRUDENTIAL NOR ANY PRUDENTIAL AFFILIATE SHALL BE OBLIGATED TO MAKE OR
ACCEPT OFFERS TO PURCHASE SHELF NOTES, OR TO QUOTE RATES, SPREADS OR OTHER TERMS
WITH RESPECT TO SPECIFIC PURCHASES OF SHELF NOTES, AND THE FACILITY SHALL IN NO
WAY BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY PRUDENTIAL OR ANY PRUDENTIAL AFFILIATE.

         2C. Issuance Period. Shelf Notes may be issued and sold pursuant to
this Agreement until the earlier of:

               (i)      January 31, 2006;

               (ii)     the thirtieth day after Prudential shall have given to
         the Company, or the Company shall have given to Prudential, a notice
         stating that it elects to terminate the issuance and sale of Shelf
         Notes pursuant to this Agreement (or if such thirtieth day is not a
         Business Day, the Business Day next preceding such thirtieth day),

               (iii)    the last Closing Day after which there is no Available
         Facility Amount,

               (iv)     the termination of the Facility under paragraph 7A, and

               (v)      the acceleration of any Note under paragraph 7A of this
         Agreement.

The period during which Shelf Notes may be issued and sold pursuant to this
Agreement is herein called the "Issuance Period".

         2D.Periodic Spread Information. Not later than 9:30 A.M. (New York
City local time) on a Business Day during the Issuance Period if there is an
Available Facility Amount on such Business Day, the Company may request by
telecopier or telephone, and Prudential will, to the extent reasonably
practicable, provide to the Company on such Business Day (or, if such request is
received after 9:30 A.M. (New York City local time) on such Business Day, on the
following Business Day), information (by telecopier or telephone) with respect
to various spreads at which Prudential or Prudential Affiliates might be
interested in purchasing Shelf Notes of different average lives; provided,
however, that the Company may not make such requests more frequently than once
in every five Business Days or such other period as shall be mutually agreed to
by the Company and Prudential. The amount and content of information so provided
shall be in the sole discretion of Prudential but it is the intent of Prudential
to provide information which will be of use to the Company in determining
whether to initiate procedures for use of the Facility. Information so provided
shall be representative of potential interest only for the periods commencing on
the day such information is provided and ending on the earlier of the fifth
Business Day after such day and the first day after such day on which further
spread information is provided. Prudential may suspend or terminate providing
information pursuant to this paragraph 2D for any reason, including its
determination that the credit quality of the Company has declined since the date
of this Agreement.

         2E.Request for Purchase. The Company may from time to time during the
Issuance Period make requests for purchases of Shelf Notes (each such request
being herein called a

                                        3

<PAGE>

"Request for Purchase"). Each Request for Purchase shall be made to Prudential
by telecopier or overnight delivery service, and shall:

               (i)      specify the aggregate principal amount of Shelf Notes
         covered thereby, which shall not be less than the lesser of (A)
         $10,000,000 and (B) the Available Facility Amount if such Available
         Facility Amount is equal to or greater than $5,000,000 and not be
         greater than the Available Facility Amount at the time such Request for
         Purchase is made,

               (ii)     specify the principal amounts, final maturities (which
         shall be no more than twelve years from the date of issuance), average
         life (which shall be no more than 10 years from the date of issuance)
         principal prepayment dates, if any, and amounts and interest payment
         periods (which shall be quarterly or semiannually in arrears) of the
         Shelf Notes covered thereby,

               (iii)    specify the use of proceeds of such Shelf Notes,

               (iv)     specify the proposed day for the closing of the purchase
         and sale of such Shelf Notes, which shall be a Business Day during the
         Issuance Period not less than 10 days and not more than 20 days after
         the making of such Request for Purchase,

               (v)      specify the number of the account and the name and
         address of the depository institution to which the purchase prices of
         such Shelf Notes are to be transferred on the Closing Day for such
         purchase and sale,

               (vi)     certify that the representations and warranties
         contained in paragraph 8 are true on and as of the date of such Request
         for Purchase and that there exists on the date of such Request for
         Purchase no Event of Default or Default, and

               (vii)    be substantially in the form of Exhibit B attached
         hereto.

Each Request for Purchase shall be in writing and shall be deemed made when
received by Prudential.

         2F.Rate Quotes. Not later than five Business Days after the Company
shall have given Prudential a Request for Purchase pursuant to paragraph 2E,
Prudential may, but shall be under no obligation to, provide to the Company by
telephone or telecopier, in each case between 9:30 A.M. and 2:00 P.M. New York
City local time (or such later time as Prudential may elect), interest rate
quotes for the several principal amounts, maturities, principal prepayment
schedules, and interest payment periods of Shelf Notes specified in such Request
for Purchase. Each quote shall represent the interest rate per annum payable on
the outstanding principal balance of such Shelf Notes at which Prudential or a
Prudential Affiliate would be willing to purchase such Shelf Notes at 100% of
the principal amount thereof.

         2G.Acceptance. Within 30 minutes after Prudential shall have provided
any interest rate quotes pursuant to paragraph 2F or such shorter period as
Prudential may specify to the Company (such period herein called the "Acceptance
Window"), the Company may, subject to

                                        4

<PAGE>

paragraph 2H, elect to accept such interest rate quotes as to not less than the
lesser of (A) $10,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Shelf Notes
specified in the related Request for Purchase or (B) the Available Facility
Amount if such Available Facility Amount is equal to or greater than $5,000,000.
Such election shall be made by an Authorized Officer of the Company notifying
Prudential by telephone or telecopier within the Acceptance Window (but not
earlier than 9:30 A.M. or later than 2:00 P.M., New York City local time) that
the Company elects to accept such interest rate quotes, specifying the Shelf
Notes (each such Shelf Note being herein called an "Accepted Note") as to which
such acceptance (herein called an "Acceptance") relates. The day the Company
notifies Prudential of an Acceptance with respect to any Accepted Notes is
herein called the "Acceptance Day" for such Accepted Notes. Any interest rate
quotes as to which Prudential does not receive an Acceptance within the
Acceptance Window shall expire, and no purchase or sale of Shelf Notes hereunder
shall be made based on such expired interest rate quotes. Subject to paragraph
2H and the other terms and conditions hereof, the Company agrees to sell to
Prudential or a Prudential Affiliate, and Prudential agrees to purchase, or to
cause the purchase by a Prudential Affiliate of, the Accepted Notes at 100% of
the principal amount of such Notes. As soon as practicable following the
Acceptance Day, the Company, Prudential and each Prudential Affiliate which is
to purchase any such Accepted Notes will execute a confirmation of such
Acceptance substantially in the form of Exhibit C attached hereto (herein called
a "Confirmation of Acceptance"). If the Company should fail to execute and
return to Prudential within three Business Days following receipt thereof a
Confirmation of Acceptance with respect to any Accepted Notes, Prudential may at
its election at any time prior to its receipt thereof cancel the closing with
respect to such Accepted Notes by so notifying the Company in writing.

         2H.Market Disruption. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2G,
if Prudential shall have provided interest rate quotes pursuant to paragraph 2F
and thereafter prior to the time an Acceptance with respect to such quotes shall
have been notified to Prudential in accordance with paragraph 2G the domestic
market for U.S. Treasury securities or other financial instruments shall have
closed or there shall have occurred a general suspension, material limitation,
or significant disruption of trading in securities generally on the New York
Stock Exchange or in the domestic market for U.S. Treasury securities or other
financial instruments, then such interest rate quotes shall expire, and no
purchase or sale of Shelf Notes hereunder shall be made based on such expired
interest rate quotes. If the Company thereafter notifies Prudential of the
Acceptance of any such interest rate quotes, such Acceptance shall be
ineffective for all purposes of this Agreement, and Prudential shall promptly
notify the Company that the provisions of this paragraph 2H are applicable with
respect to such Acceptance.

         2I. Facility Closings. Not later than 11:30 A.M. (New York City local
time) on the Closing Day for any Accepted Notes, the Company will deliver to
each Purchaser listed in the Confirmation of Acceptance relating thereto at the
offices of the Prudential Capital Group, 1114 Avenue of the Americas, 30th
Floor, New York, New York, the Accepted Notes to be purchased by such Purchaser
in the form of one or more Notes in authorized denominations as such Purchaser
may request for each Series of Accepted Notes to be purchased on the Closing
Day, dated the Closing Day and registered in such Purchaser's name (or in the
name of its nominee), against payment of the purchase price thereof by transfer
of immediately available funds for credit to the Company's account specified in
the Request for Purchase of such Notes. If the

                                        5

<PAGE>
Company fails to tender to any Purchaser the Accepted Notes to be purchased by
such Purchaser on the scheduled Closing Day for such Accepted Notes as provided
above in this paragraph 2I, or any of the conditions specified in paragraph 3
shall not have been fulfilled by the time required on such scheduled Closing
Day, the Company shall, prior to 1:00 P.M., New York City local time, on such
scheduled Closing Day notify Prudential (which notification shall be deemed
received by each Purchaser) in writing whether (i) such closing is to be
rescheduled (such rescheduled date to be a Business Day during the Issuance
Period not less than one Business Day and not more than 10 Business Days after
such scheduled Closing Day (the "Rescheduled Closing Day") and certify to
Prudential (which certification shall be for the benefit of each Purchaser) that
the Company reasonably believes that it will be able to comply with the
conditions set forth in paragraph 3 on such Rescheduled Closing Day and that the
Company will pay the Delayed Delivery Fee, if applicable, in accordance with
paragraph 2J(3) or (ii) such closing is to be canceled. In the event that the
Company shall fail to give such notice referred to in the preceding sentence,
Prudential (on behalf of each Purchaser) may at its election, at any time after
1:00 P.M., New York City local time, on such scheduled Closing Day, notify the
Company in writing that such closing is to be canceled. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary appearing in this Agreement, the Company may elect to reschedule
a closing with respect to any given Accepted Notes on not more than one
occasion, unless Prudential shall have otherwise consented in writing.

         2J.   Fees.

         2J(1) Facility Fee. In consideration for the time, effort and expense
involved in the preparation, negotiation and execution of this Agreement, on the
Amendment Closing Day, the Company will pay to Prudential in immediately
available funds a nonrefundable fee (herein called the "Facility Fee") in the
amount of $30,000.00.

         2J(2) Issuance Fee. The Company will pay to Prudential in immediately
available funds a fee (herein called the "Issuance Fee") on each Closing Day
(other than on the Amendment Closing Day) in an amount equal to 0.125% of the
aggregate principal amount of Notes sold on such Closing Day.

         2J(3) Delayed Delivery Fee. If the closing of the purchase and sale of
any Accepted Note is delayed for any reason beyond the original Closing Day for
such Accepted Note, the Company will pay to Prudential (a) on the Cancellation
Date or actual closing date of such purchase and sale and (b) if earlier, the
next Business Day following 90 days after the Acceptance Day for such Accepted
Note and on each Business Day following 90 days after the prior payment
hereunder, a fee (herein called the "Delayed Delivery Fee") calculated as
follows:

                           (BEY - MMY) X DTS/360 X PA

where "BEY" means Bond Equivalent Yield, i.e., the bond equivalent yield per
annum of such Accepted Note, "MMY" means Money Market Yield, i.e., the yield per
annum on a commercial paper investment of the highest quality selected by
Prudential on the date Prudential receives notice of the delay in the closing
for such Accepted Note having a maturity date or dates the same as, or closest
to, the Rescheduled Closing Day or Rescheduled Closing Days (a new alternative
investment being selected by Prudential each time such closing is delayed);
"DTS"

                                        6

<PAGE>

means Days to Settlement, i.e., the number of actual days elapsed from and
including the original Closing Day with respect to such Accepted Note (in the
case of the first such payment with respect to such Accepted Note) or from and
including the date of the next preceding payment (in the case of any subsequent
delayed delivery fee payment with respect to such Accepted Note) to but
excluding the date of such payment; and "PA" means Principal Amount, i.e., the
principal amount of the Accepted Note for which such calculation is being made.
In no case shall the Delayed Delivery Fee be less than zero. If the foregoing
calculation yields a negative number or zero, no Delayed Delivery Fee shall be
due. Nothing contained herein shall obligate any Purchaser to purchase any
Accepted Note on any day other than the Closing Day for such Accepted Note, as
the same may be rescheduled from time to time in compliance with paragraph 2I.

         2J(4) Cancellation Fee. If the Company at any time notifies Prudential
in writing that the Company is canceling the closing of the purchase and sale of
any Accepted Note, or if Prudential notifies the Company in writing under the
circumstances set forth in the last sentence of paragraph 2G or the penultimate
sentence of paragraph 2I that the closing of the purchase and sale of such
Accepted Note is to be canceled, or if the closing of the purchase and sale of
such Accepted Note is not consummated on or prior to the last day of the
Issuance Period (the date of any such notification, or the last day of the
Issuance Period, as the case may be, being herein called the "Cancellation
Date"), the Company will pay the Purchasers in immediately available funds an
amount (the "Cancellation Fee") calculated as follows:

                                     PI X PA

where "PI" means Price Increase, i.e., the quotient (expressed in decimals)
obtained by dividing (a) the excess of the ask price (as determined by
Prudential) of the Hedge Treasury Note(s) on the Cancellation Date over the bid
price (as determined by Prudential) of the Hedge Treasury Notes(s) having a
maturity date the same as, or closest to, such Accepted Note, on the Acceptance
Day (if the difference is a negative number or zero, no Cancellation Fee shall
be due) by (b) such bid price; and "PA" has the meaning ascribed to it in
paragraph 2J(3). The foregoing bid and ask prices shall be as reported by
Telerate Systems, Inc. (or, if such data for any reason ceases to be available
through Telerate Systems, Inc., any publicly available source of similar market
data). Each price shall be based on a U.S. Treasury security having a par value
of $100.00 and shall be rounded to the second decimal place. In no case shall
the Cancellation Fee be less than zero.

         3. CONDITIONS OF CLOSING. The obligation of any Purchaser to purchase
and pay for any other Notes is subject to the satisfaction of (i) all of the
conditions set forth in this paragraph 3 other than paragraph 3A(2) on or before

<PAGE>

circumstances set forth in paragraphs 4B, 4D and 4F. Any prepayment made by the
Company pursuant to any other provision of this paragraph 4 shall not reduce or
otherwise affect its obligation to make any required prepayment as specified in
paragraph 4A.

         4A.Required Prepayments of Notes. Until the Issued Series A Notes shall
be paid in full, the Company shall apply to the prepayment of the Issued Series
A Notes, without Yield-Maintenance Amount, the sum of $10,000,000 on each of
April 9, 2005 and April 9, 2006, and such principal amounts of the Issued Series
A Notes, together with interest thereon to the payment dates, shall become due
on such payment dates. The remaining unpaid principal amount of the Issued
Series A Notes, together with interest accrued thereon, shall become due on the
maturity date of the Issued Series A Notes. Each other Series of Shelf Notes
shall be subject to required prepayments, if any, set forth in the Notes of such
Series.

         4B.Optional Prepayment With Yield-Maintenance Amount. The Notes of each
Series shall be subject to prepayment, in whole at any time or from time to time
in part (in integral multiples of $1,000,000 and in a minimum amount of
$5,000,000), at the option of the Company, at 100% of the principal amount so
prepaid plus interest thereon to the prepayment date and the Yield-Maintenance
Amount, if any, with respect to each such Note. Any partial prepayment of a
Series of the Notes pursuant to this paragraph 4B shall be applied in
satisfaction of required payments of principal in inverse order of their
scheduled due dates.

         4C.Notice of Optional Prepayment. The Company shall give the holder of
each Note of a Series to be prepaid pursuant to paragraph 4B irrevocable written
notice of such prepayment not less than 10 Business Days prior to the prepayment
date, specifying such prepayment date, the aggregate principal amount of the
Notes of such Series to be prepaid on such date, the principal amount of the
Notes of such Series held by such holder to be prepaid on that date and that
such prepayment is to be made pursuant to paragraph 4B. Notice of prepayment
having been given as aforesaid, the principal amount of the Notes specified in
such notice, together with interest thereon to the prepayment date and together
with the Yield-Maintenance Amount, if any, herein provided, shall become due and
payable on such prepayment date. The Company shall, on or before the day on
which it gives written notice of any prepayment pursuant to paragraph 4B, give
telephonic notice of the principal amount of the Notes to be prepaid and the
prepayment date to each Significant Holder which shall have designated a
recipient for such notices in the Purchaser Schedule attached hereto or the
applicable Confirmation of Acceptance or by notice in writing to the Company.

         4D.Mandatory Offer to Prepay.

               (a) Upon receipt by the Company or any Subsidiary of Net Cash
         Proceeds from any Securitization Transaction, the Company shall certify
         to the Purchasers the amount of such Net Cash Proceeds so received and
         offer to prepay the Notes (as provided in clause (b) below) in an
         aggregate principal amount equal to 50% of the Net Cash Proceeds.

               (b) The offer to prepay Notes contemplated by the foregoing
         subparagraph (a) shall be made in writing to each holder of a Note at
         least 10 Business Days before the proposed date of prepayment
         specifying such proposed date and the amount available for prepayment.
         A holder of a Note may accept such offer to prepay by causing a notice
         of

                                       11

<PAGE>

         such acceptance to be delivered to the Company within seven Business
         Days after receipt of the notice required pursuant to this subparagraph
         (b). A failure by a holder of Notes to respond to an offer to prepay
         made pursuant to this subparagraph (b) within such seven Business Day
         period shall be deemed to constitute a rejection of such offer by such
         holder. The amount of all prepayments pursuant to subparagraph (a)
         shall be made ratably to each holder of a Note accepting an offer to
         prepay made under this paragraph 4D. For purposes of subparagraph (a)
         and this subparagraph (b), each Note's pro rata share shall be a
         fraction, the numerator of which is the unpaid principal balance of
         such Note on the date of such prepayment (the "Note Prepayment
         Amount"), and the denominator of which is the sum of the Note
         Prepayment Amount for such Note plus the Note Prepayment Amount for
         each other Note to be prepaid on the date of prepayment, provided,
         however, that in no event will the aggregate amount the Company or any
         Subsidiary may be obligated to pay under this paragraph 4D exceed 50%
         of Net Cash Proceeds received by such entity. No Yield-Maintenance
         Amount shall be payable in connection with any prepayment under this
         paragraph 4D.

         4E.Allocation of Partial Prepayments. In the case of each prepayment of
less than the entire unpaid principal amount of all outstanding Notes of any
Series pursuant to paragraphs 4A, 4B or 4D, the amount to be prepaid shall be
applied pro rata to all outstanding Notes of such Series (including, for the
purpose of this paragraph 4E only, all Notes prepaid or otherwise retired or
purchased or otherwise acquired by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates other than by prepayment pursuant to paragraph 4A, 4B or 4D)
according to the respective unpaid principal amounts thereof.

         4F.Offer to Prepay Notes in the Event of a Change in Control.

         4F(1) Notice of Impending Change in Control. The Company shall give to
each holder of Notes prompt written notice of any impending Change in Control
for which it has received a written offer or notice.

         4F(2) Notice of Occurrence of Change in Control. The Company will,
within five Business Days after any Responsible Officer has knowledge of the
occurrence of any Change in Control, give written notice of such Change in
Control to each holder of Notes. If a Change in Control has occurred and in
connection therewith (i) the Availability Period (as defined in the Bank
Agreement), the Commitment Termination Date (as defined in the Bank Agreement),
or any other similar or corresponding terms used in the Bank Agreement, is
reduced or accelerated (whether by waiver, amendment, or otherwise), (ii) any
Debt under the Bank Agreement becomes due and payable or is required to be
prepaid or redeemed (other than by a regularly scheduled required prepayment or
redemption), purchased or defeased or (iii) any Commitments (as defined in the
Bank Agreement) under the Bank Agreement are terminated, then such notice shall
contain and constitute an offer to prepay the Notes as described in paragraphs
4F(3) and 4F(5) and shall be accompanied by the certificate described in
paragraph 4F(6) hereof.

         4F(3) Offer to Prepay Notes. The offer to prepay Notes contemplated by
the foregoing paragraph 4F(2) shall be an offer to prepay, in accordance with
and subject to this paragraph 4F, all, but not less than all, the Notes held by
each holder (in this case only, "holder" in respect of any Note registered in
the name of a nominee for a disclosed beneficial owner shall mean such

                                       12

<PAGE>

beneficial owner) on a date specified in such offer (the "Proposed Prepayment
Date"). Such Proposed Prepayment Date shall be not less than 30 days and not
more than 90 days after the date of such offer (if the Proposed Prepayment Date
shall not be specified in such offer, the Proposed Prepayment Date shall be the
60th day after the date of such offer).

         4F(4) Rejection, Acceptance. A holder of Notes may accept the offer to
prepay made pursuant to this paragraph 4F by causing a notice of such acceptance
to be delivered to the Company no later than seven Business Days prior to the
Proposed Prepayment Date. A failure by a holder of Notes to respond to an offer
to prepay made pursuant to this paragraph 4F within such seven Business Day
period shall be deemed to constitute a rejection of such offer by such holder.

         4F(5) Prepayment. Prepayment of the Notes to be prepaid pursuant to
this paragraph 4F shall be at 100% of the principal amount of such Notes,
together with interest on such Notes accrued but unpaid to the date of
prepayment. The prepayment shall be made on the Proposed Prepayment Date. No
Yield-Maintenance Amount shall be payable in connection with any prepayment
under this paragraph 4F.

         4F(6) Officer's Certificate. Each offer to prepay the Notes pursuant to
this paragraph 4F shall be accompanied by a certificate, executed by a

         4F(7) Termination of Effectiveness. Immediately upon the effectiveness
of an amendment of the Bank Agreement such that a Change of Control shall cease

         4G.Maturity; Surrender, Etc. In the case of the prepayment of Notes
pursuant to this paragraph 4, the principal amount of each Note to be prepaid
shall mature and become due and payable on the date fixed for such prepayment,
together with interest on such principal amount accrued but unpaid prior to such
date and the applicable Yield-Maintenance Amount, if any. From and after such
date, unless prior thereto the Company shall fail to pay such principal amount
when so due and payable, together with the interest and the applicable
Yield-Maintenance Amount, if any, as aforesaid, interest on such principal
amount shall cease to accrue. Any Note paid or prepaid in full shall be

the Company or such Subsidiary or Affiliate shall have offered to prepay or
otherwise retire or purchase or otherwise acquire, as the case may be, the same

each other holder of Notes of such Series at the time outstanding upon the same
terms and conditions. Any Notes so prepaid or otherwise retired or purchased or
otherwise acquired by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates shall
not be deemed to be outstanding for any purpose under this Agreement, except as
provided in paragraph 4E.

thereto.

         5B.Inspection of Property. The Company covenants that, at such
reasonable times and upon reasonable notice and as often as a Significant Holder
may reasonably request, it will permit any Person designated by a Significant
Holder in writing, at such Significant Holder's expense unless a Default has
occurred and is continuing in which case at the Company's expense, to:

               (i)      visit and inspect any of the properties of the Company

or any Subsidiary shall create or assume any Lien upon any of its property or
assets, whether now owned or hereafter acquired, other than Liens permitted by
paragraph 6B(1) (unless prior written consent shall have been obtained under
paragraph 11C), it will make or cause to be made effective provision whereby the
Notes will be secured by such Lien equally and ratably with any and all other
Debt thereby secured so long as any such other Debt shall be so secured.

         5D.Guaranteed Obligations. The Company covenants that if any Person
(other than the Company) Guarantees or provides collateral in any manner for any
Debt of the Company or any Subsidiary other than as permitted by paragraph
6B(1), it will simultaneously cause such Person to Guarantee or provide
collateral for the Notes equally and ratably with all Debt Guaranteed or secured
by such Person for so long as such Debt is Guaranteed and pursuant to
documentation in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such holder.
Subject to the foregoing, the Company shall cause each of its Subsidiaries not
existing as of the date hereof to execute and deliver a guaranty agreement, in
substantially the form of the Guaranty Agreements, as soon as practicable and in
any event within thirty days of the creation or acquisition of any such

                                       17

<PAGE>

Subsidiary. The delivery of such guaranty agreement shall be accompanied by such
other documents as the Required Holders may reasonably request including

         5E.Maintenance of Insurance. The Company covenants that it and each
Subsidiary will maintain, with responsible insurers, insurance with respect to
its properties and business against such casualties and contingencies
(including, but not limited to, public liability, larceny, embezzlement or other
criminal misappropriation) and in such amounts as is customary in the case of
similarly situated corporations engaged in the same or similar businesses.

         5F.Maintenance of Corporate Existence/Compliance with Law/Preservation
of Property. The Company covenants that, except as permitted under paragraphs
6B(3) and 6C, it and each Subsidiary will do or cause to be done all things
necessary to, at all times:

               (i)      preserve, renew and maintain in full force and effect
         its legal existence of the Company and its Subsidiaries and continue to
         engage in the same business as presently conducted or such other
         businesses that are reasonably related thereto; provided, however, the
         Company shall not be required to preserve the legal existence of any
         Subsidiary if the Company reasonably determines that the preservation
         thereof is no longer necessary or desirable in the conduct of the
         business of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

               (ii)     comply with all laws and regulations (including, without
         limitation, laws and regulations relating to equal employment
         opportunity and employee safety) applicable to it and any Subsidiary,
         except where the failure to comply, either individually or in the
         aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material
         Adverse Effect;

               (iii)    maintain, preserve and protect all material licenses,
         certificates, permits, franchises and intellectual property of the
         Company and its Subsidiaries; and

               (iv)     preserve all the remainder of its property used or
         useful in the conduct of its business and keep the same in good repair,
         working order and condition excluding normal wear and tear, except
         where the failure to preserve such property, either individually or in
         the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to have a Material
         Adverse Effect.

         5G.Compliance with Environmental Laws. The Company covenants that it
and each Subsidiary will, comply in a timely fashion with, or operate pursuant
to valid waivers of the provisions of, all applicable Environmental
Requirements, including, without limitation, the emission of wastewater
effluent, solid and hazardous waste and air emissions together with any other
applicable Environmental Requirements for conducting, on a timely basis,
periodic tests and monitoring for contamination of ground water, surface water,
air and land and for biological toxicity of the aforesaid, and all applicable
regulations of the Environmental Protection Agency or other relevant
Governmental Authority, except where the failure to comply could not

                                       18

<PAGE>

reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The Company agrees to
indemnify and hold you, your officers, agents and employees (each an
"Indemnified Person") harmless from any loss, liability, claim or expense that
you may incur or suffer as a result of a breach by the Company or any
Subsidiary, as the case may be, of this covenant other than as a result of the
gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnified Person. The Company
shall not be deemed to have breached or violated this paragraph 5G if the
Company or any Subsidiary is challenging in good faith by appropriate
proceedings diligently pursued the application or enforcement of such
Environmental Requirements for which adequate reserves have been established in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

         5H.No Integration. The Company covenants that it has taken and will
take all necessary action so that the issuance of the Notes does not and will
not require registration under the Securities Act. The Company covenants that no
future offer and sale of debt securities of the Company of any class will be
made if there is a reasonable possibility that such offer and sale would, under
the doctrine of "integration", subject the issuance of the Notes to you to the
registration requirements of the Securities Act.

         5I.Financial Records. The Company covenants that it and each Subsidiary
will keep proper books of record and account in which full and correct entries
(in all material respects and subject to normal year end adjustments and, as to
interim statements, the absence of footnotes) will be made of the business and
affairs of the Company or such Subsidiary under generally accepted accounting
principles consistently applied (except for changes disclosed in the financial
statements furnished to you pursuant to paragraph 5A and concurred in by the
independent public accountants referred to in paragraph 5A).

         5J.Other Covenants. If (in the reasonable opinion of the Required
Holders) at any time and from time to time, after the date hereof, any of the
material covenants, material representations and warranties or material events
of default, or any other material term or provision (other than any term or
provision relating to payment terms, interest rates or penalties) (collectively,
"Material Provisions"), contained in any document evidencing any Debt in excess
of $5,000,000, or in any document, agreement or instrument from time to time
entered into by the Company in respect thereof (collectively, the "Other Debt
Documents"), is more favorable to the lender or beneficiary under such Other
Debt Documents than are the terms of this Agreement to the holders of the Notes,
this Agreement shall be deemed amended to contain each more favorable Material
Provision on the same basis and to the extent that such Material Provisions are
reflected in such Other Debt Documents. The Company hereby agrees to so amend
this Agreement and to execute and deliver all such documents required by the
Required Holder(s) to reflect such Amendment. Prior to the execution and
delivery of such documents by the Company, this Agreement shall be deemed to
contain each more favorable Material Provision for purposes of determining the
rights and obligations hereunder.

         5K.Payment of Obligations. The Company will, and will cause each
Subsidiary to, pay and discharge at or before maturity, all of its obligations
and liabilities, including without limitation:

                                       19

<PAGE>

               (i)      all taxes, assessments and governmental charges or
         levies imposed upon it or any of its property other than any taxes,
         assessments and government charges or levies; and

               (ii)     all claims or demands of materialmen, mechanics,
         carriers, warehousemen, vendors, landlords and other like Persons that,
         if unpaid, could reasonable be expected to result in the creation of a
         Lien upon any of its property:

         provided, that items of the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) need not be
         paid

                        (1) while being actively contested in good faith by
               appropriate proceedings diligently conducted and with respect to
               which adequate reserves or other appropriate provisions have been
               established and are being maintained in accordance with generally
               accepted accounting principles;

                        (2) if applicable, so long as the title to, and right to
               use, such property, is not materially adversely affected thereby;
               and

                        (3) the failure to make payment pending such contest
               could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
               Effect.

         5L.Additional Subsidiaries. If any additional Subsidiary is acquired
or formed after the date hereof, the Company will, within fifteen (15) Business
Days after such Subsidiary is acquired or formed, notify each of the Significant
Holders and will cause such Subsidiary to deliver simultaneously therewith
similar documents applicable to such Subsidiary required under paragraph 3A as
reasonably requested by the Required Holders.

         5M.Compliance with Major Distribution Agreements. The Company and each
applicable Subsidiary (a) will strictly comply with all of the terms and
provisions of all Major Distribution Agreements, (b) will not make or permit to
be made any material modification or amendment to any such Major Distribution
Agreement without the prior written consent of the Required Holders, and (c)
will maintain each such Major Distribution Agreement in full force and effect
and free of default thereunder at all times during of the term of this
Agreement, provided, in the case of each of clauses (a), (b) and (c) hereof,
such failure to do so would result in, or could reasonably be expected to result
in, a Material Adverse Effect.

         6. NEGATIVE COVENANTS. Unless the Required Holders otherwise agree in
writing, the Company shall not, and shall not permit any Subsidiary, to take any
of the following actions or permit the occurrence or existence of any of the
following events or conditions:

         6A. Financial Limitation. The Company covenants that it will not permit

         reduction for net losses during any period) for the fiscal quarter of
         the Company ending on such day (adjusting the computation of
         Consolidated Net Income for certain items, as provided for in the
         definition of "Consolidated Net Income"), plus (iii) one hundred
         percent (100%) of the aggregate Net Cash Proceeds of any Equity

         quarter ended June 30, 2002, a ratio of Consolidated Current Assets to
         Consolidated Debt less than 1.50:1.00, calculated at the end of each
         fiscal quarter of the Company;

provided, however, that if (A) the Bank Agreement is amended to increase the
Consolidated Debt to Consolidated EBITDA ratio for the most recently ended four
fiscal quarter period, the Purchasers agree to amend clause (i) above so that
the Consolidated Debt to Consolidated EBITDA ratio is also increased
accordingly, provided, however, that the Consolidated Debt to Consolidated
EBITDA ratio shall not, at any time, exceed 375%, (B) the Bank Agreement is
amended to increase the Consolidated Debt to Consolidated Total Capitalization
ratio for the most recently ended four fiscal quarter period, the Purchasers
agree to amend clause (ii) above so that the Consolidated Debt to Consolidated

that the Consolidated Debt to Consolidated Total Capitalization ratio shall not,
at any time, exceed 62.5%, and (C) if the Bank Agreement is amended to delete
Section 6.2, Section 6.3 or Section 6.5 thereof, the Purchasers agree to delete

<PAGE>

         principal amount not to exceed $20,000,000 at any time outstanding that
         represents a portion of the costs of an Acquisition permitted by
         Paragraph 6B(4)(vi) payable to Persons selling an equity interest or
         assets to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; provided, that such
         Debt is fully subordinate (other than in those cases where supported by
         a Letter of Credit) to the payment and performance of the Obligations
         on terms and in form and substance satisfactory to the Required

         aggregate Debt amount, in the event that any such Debt is secured or
         enhanced by a Letter of Credit or by a Guarantee of the Company or any
         of its Subsidiaries, the principal amount of the Debt and not the
         amount of any such Letter of Credit or Guarantee, shall count towards
         such $20,000,000 limitation.

Notwithstanding the foregoing exceptions to the prohibition against incurring or
maintaining Debt, the Company shall not permit at any time, prior to or after
the incurrence thereof, the aggregate outstanding amount of Debt to exceed the
limitations of paragraph 6A hereof or incur any Debt if a Default or Event of

         (A) the aggregate costs incurred in making such investments (reduced by
         cash dividends or other cash payments received on or in consideration
         of such investments) shall not exceed $20,000,000 in the aggregate at
         any time and (B) prior to and immediately after giving effect to such

which any asset or services of the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company is
transferred to such Affiliate or Subsidiary, or from such Affiliate or

on terms more favorable than would be reasonably expected to be given in a
similar transaction with an unrelated entity.

         6C.Sale of Assets. The Company will not, and will not permit any

         connection with any Securitization Transaction in an aggregate amount
         not to exceed $75,000,000 at any time during the term of this

               (vii)    the Company or any Subsidiary may Dispose of its assets

               Fair Market Value of such assets at the time of such Disposition;

               by the Company and its Subsidiaries (other than pursuant to
               clause (iv)) does not constitute a Substantial Part of the
               Consolidated assets or (2) the proceeds of such Disposition are
               reinvested in a similar business or assets within 12 months of
               such Disposition; and

               (viii)   the sale, without recourse, other than for
         misrepresentation, by any Subsidiary of accounts receivable having a
         value, net of all allowances and discounts, not to exceed during any
         fiscal year of the Company an aggregate dollar value of $5,000,000,
         which receivables shall be payable by Persons who are not United States

         aggregate amount not to exceed $25,000,000 in any fiscal year of the
         Company;

provided, however, that if the Bank Agreement is amended to delete Section
7.6(e) or Section 7.6(f) thereof, respectively, the Purchasers agree to delete
the corresponding clause (viii) or (ix) above, as the case may be.

         For purposes of this paragraph 6C:

               (i)      "Dispose" means the sale, lease, transfer or other
         disposition of property of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and
         "Disposition" and "Disposed of" has a corresponding meaning to Dispose;

                                       26

               (ii)     Calculation of net book value. The net book value of any

         case of the sale or issuance of the stock of a Subsidiary, the amount
         of Consolidated Assets contributed by the stock Disposed of shall be
         assumed to be the percentage of outstanding stock sold or to be sold.

         options to acquire stock of) any other Subsidiary, except to the
         Company or a wholly-owned Subsidiary and except as permitted pursuant
         to paragraph 6C;

               (iii)    permit any Subsidiary directly or indirectly to issue
         or sell any shares of its stock (or warrants, rights or options to

               (iv)     permit any Subsidiary to enter into or otherwise be
         bound by or subject to any contract or agreement (including, without
         limitation, any provision of its certificate or articles of
         incorporation or bylaws) that restricts its ability to pay dividends or
         other distributions on account of its stock except for such
         restrictions set forth in the Bank Agreement, so long as such
         restrictions do not prohibit or restrict any Subsidiary's ability to
         pay dividends or other distributions on account of its stock to the
         Company or another Subsidiary;

               (v)      permit any Subsidiary to create, incur, assume or

               (vi)     permit any Guarantor to make any payments under any
         Subsidiary Guarantee Agreement (as defined in the Bank Agreement)

         6E.Sale of Receivables. The Company covenants that it will not, and
will not permit any Subsidiary to, sell (with or without recourse), or discount
or otherwise sell for less than the face value thereof, any of its Receivables
other than in connection with a sale in accordance with paragraph 6C(vi).

         6F.ERISA. The Company covenants that it will not, nor permit any
Subsidiary to:

         Multiemployer Plan) resulting in the incurrence of any material
         liability to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation;

               (ii)     engage in or permit any Person to engage in any
         prohibited transaction (as defined in Section 4975 of the Code)

         subject the Company or any Subsidiary to any material tax, penalty or
         other liability;

               (iii)    incur or suffer to exist any material accumulated
         funding deficiency (as defined in Section 302 of ERISA and Section 412

         Multiemployer Plan); or

               (iv)     allow or suffer to exist any risk or condition which
         presents a risk of incurring a material liability to the Pension
         Benefit Guaranty Corporation.

         6G.Environmental Matters. The Company covenants that it will not, and
will not permit any Third Party to, use, produce, manufacture, process,
generate, store, dispose of, manage at, or ship or transport to or from the
Properties any Hazardous Materials except for Hazardous Materials used,
produced, released or managed in the ordinary course of business in compliance

         or (ii) of this paragraph 7A, any holder (other than the Company or any
         of its Subsidiaries) of any Note may at its option during the

         Company, terminate the Facility and/or declare all of the Notes held by
         such holder to be, and all of the Notes held by such holder shall
         thereupon be and become, immediately due and payable at par together

         Amount, if any, with respect to each Note of such Series, without
         presentment, demand, protest or notice of any kind, all of which are
         hereby waived by the Company.

         7B. Rescission of Acceleration. At any time after any or all of the
Notes of any Series shall have been declared immediately due and payable
pursuant to paragraph 7A, the Required Holder(s) of the Notes of such Series
may, by notice in writing to the Company, rescind and annul such declaration and
its consequences if:

         non-payment of amounts which have become due solely by reason of such
         declaration, shall have been cured or waived pursuant to paragraph 11C,
         and

               (iv)     no judgment or decree shall have been entered for the
         payment of any amounts due pursuant to the Notes of such Series or this
         Agreement.

                                       31

<PAGE>

No such rescission or annulment shall extend to or affect any subsequent Event
of Default or Default or impair any right arising therefrom.

         7C.Notice of Acceleration or Rescission. Whenever any Note shall be
declared immediately due and payable pursuant to paragraph 7A or any such

Company shall forthwith give written notice thereof to the holder of each Note
of each Series at the time outstanding.

         7D.Other Remedies. If any Event of Default or Default shall occur and
be continuing, the holder of any Note may proceed to protect and enforce its
rights under this Agreement and such Note by exercising such remedies as are
available to such holder in respect thereof under applicable law, either by suit
in equity or by action at law, or both, whether for specific performance of any
covenant or other agreement contained in this Agreement or in aid of the
exercise of any power granted in this Agreement. No remedy conferred in this
Agreement upon the holder of any Note is intended to be exclusive of any other
remedy, and each and every such remedy shall be cumulative and shall be in
addition to every other remedy conferred herein or now or hereafter existing at
law or in equity or by statute or otherwise.

         8. REPRESENTATIONS, COVENANTS AND WARRANTIES. The Company represents,
covenants and warrants as follows (all references to "Subsidiary" and
"Subsidiaries" in this paragraph 8 shall be deemed omitted if the Company has no
Subsidiaries at the time the representations herein are made or repeated):

         8A.Organization.

               (i)      The Company is a corporation duly organized and existing
         in good standing under the laws of the State of Florida, and each
         Subsidiary is duly organized and existing in good standing under the
         laws of the jurisdiction in which it is incorporated. Schedule 8A
         hereto is an accurate and complete list of all Subsidiaries as of the
         Amendment Closing Day, including the jurisdiction of incorporation and
         ownership of all such Subsidiaries. The Company and each Subsidiary has
         the corporate power to own its respective properties and to carry on
         its respective businesses as now being conducted and is duly qualified
         and authorized to do business in each other jurisdiction in which the
         character of its respective properties or the nature of its respective
         businesses require such qualification or authorization except where the
         failure to be so qualified or authorized could not reasonably be
         expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

               (ii)     No Subsidiary is a party to, or otherwise subject to,
         any legal restriction or any agreement restricting the ability of such
         Subsidiary to pay dividends out of profits or make other similar
         distributions of profits to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that
         owns outstanding shares of Capital Stock or similar equity interests of
         such Subsidiary.

         8B.Financial Statements. The Company has furnished you with the
following financial statements, identified by a principal financial officer of
the Company:

                                       32

<PAGE>

               (i)      a Consolidated balance sheet as at the last day of the
         fiscal year in each of the years 2000 to 2001, inclusive, a
         Consolidated statement of income, stockholders' equity and cash flows
         for each such year, all reported on by Arthur Andersen LLC; and

               (ii)     a Consolidated balance sheet as at June 30, 2002 and
         Consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity and cash flows
         for the six-month period ended on each such date, prepared by the
         Company.

Those financial statements (including any related schedules and/or notes) fairly
present in all material respects (subject, as to interim statements, to the
absence of footnotes or to changes resulting from normal year-end adjustments)
the financial condition of the Company and have been prepared in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied throughout the
periods involved and show all liabilities, direct and contingent, of the Company
and its Subsidiaries required to be shown in accordance with such principles.
The balance sheets fairly present, in all material respects, the Consolidated
financial condition of the Company and its Subsidiaries as at the dates thereof,
and the statements of income, stockholders' equity and cash flows fairly
present, in all material respects, the Consolidated results of the operations of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, the changes in the Company's stockholders'
equity and their Consolidated cash flows for the periods indicated. Since
December 31, 2001, there have been no changes with respect to the Company and
its Subsidiaries which have had or could reasonably be expected to have, singly
or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

         8C.Actions Pending. Except as set forth on Schedule 8C hereto, there
is no action, suit, investigation or proceeding pending or, to the knowledge of
the Company, threatened against or affecting the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or any properties or rights of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, by or before any court, arbitrator or administrative or
governmental body (i) as to which there is a reasonable possibility of an
adverse determination that could reasonably be expected to have, either
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect or (ii) which in any
manner draws into question the validity or enforceability of this Agreement or
any of the Notes.

         8D.Outstanding Debt. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
has outstanding any Debt except as permitted by paragraphs 6A and 6B(2). There
exists no default under the provisions of any instrument evidencing such Debt or
of any agreement relating thereto. Schedule 8D hereto (as such Schedule 8D may
have been modified from time to time by written supplements thereto delivered by
the Company to Prudential) is an accurate and complete list of Debt of the
Company and its Subsidiaries on the applicable Closing Day.

         8E.Title to Properties. The Company has and each of its Subsidiaries
has good and indefeasible title to its respective real properties (other than
properties which it leases) and good title to all of its other respective
properties and assets, including the properties and assets reflected in the most
recent audited balance sheet referred to in paragraph 8B (other than properties
and assets disposed of in the ordinary course of business), subject to no Lien
of any kind except Liens permitted by paragraph 6B(1). All leases necessary in
any material respect for the conduct of the respective businesses of the Company
and its Subsidiaries are valid and subsisting and are in full force and effect.

                                       33

<PAGE>

         8F.Taxes. The Company has filed and each of its Subsidiaries has filed
all federal, state and other income tax returns which, to the best knowledge of
the chief financial officer of the Company and its Subsidiaries, are required to
be filed, and each has paid all taxes as shown on such returns and on all
assessments received by it to the extent that such taxes have become due, except
such taxes as are being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings for
which adequate reserves have been established in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles.

         8G.Conflicting Agreements and Other Matters. Neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any contract or agreement or subject to
any charter or other corporate restriction which materially and adversely
affects its business, property or assets, condition (financial or otherwise) or
operations. Neither the execution nor delivery of this Agreement or the Notes,
nor the offering, issuance and sale of the Notes, nor fulfillment of nor
compliance with the terms and provisions hereof and of the Notes will conflict
with, or result in a breach of the terms, conditions or provisions of, or
constitute a default under, or result in any violation of, or result in the
creation of any Lien upon any of the properties or assets of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries pursuant to, the charter or by-laws of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, any award of any arbitrator or any agreement (including any
agreement with stockholders), instrument, order, judgment, decree, statute, law,
rule or regulation to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is subject.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or otherwise
subject to any provision contained in, any instrument evidencing Debt of the
Company or such Subsidiary, any agreement relating thereto or any other contract
or agreement (including its charter) which limits the amount of, or otherwise
imposes restrictions on the incurring of, Debt of the Company or such Subsidiary
of the type and in the amount to be evidenced by the Notes except as set forth
in the agreements listed in Schedule 8G hereto.

         8H.Offering of Notes. Neither the Company nor any agent acting on its
behalf has, directly or indirectly, offered the Notes or any similar security of
the Company for sale to, or solicited any offers to buy the Notes or any similar
security of the Company from, or otherwise approached or negotiated with respect
thereto with, any Person other than institutional investors, and neither the
Company nor any agent acting on its behalf has taken or will take any action
which would subject the issuance or sale of the Notes to the provisions of
Section 5 of the Securities Act or to the provisions of any securities or Blue
Sky law of any applicable jurisdiction. The Company hereby represents and
warrants to you that, within the preceding twelve months, neither the Company
nor any other Person acting on behalf of the Company has offered or sold to any
Person (other than accredited investors) any Notes, or any securities of the
same or a similar class as the Notes, or any other substantially similar
securities of the Company.

         8I. Use of Proceeds. None of the proceeds of the sale of any Notes will
be used, directly or indirectly, for the purpose, whether immediate, incidental
or ultimate, of purchasing or carrying any "margin stock" as defined in
Regulation U or X (12 C.F.R. Parts 221 and 224) of the Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System (herein called "margin stock") or for the purpose of
maintaining, reducing or retiring any Debt which was originally incurred to
purchase or carry any stock that is then currently a margin stock or for any
other purpose which might constitute the purchase of such Notes a "purpose
credit" within the meaning of such Regulation U, unless the Company shall have
delivered to the Purchaser which is purchasing such Notes, on

                                       34

<PAGE>

the Closing Day for such Notes, an opinion of counsel satisfactory to such
Purchaser stating that the purchase of such Notes does not constitute a
violation of such Regulation U. Neither the Company nor any agent acting on its
behalf has taken or will take any action which might cause this Agreement or the
Notes to violate Regulation U, Regulation T or any other regulation of the Board
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or to violate the Exchange Act, in
each case as in effect now or as the same may hereafter be in effect. None of
the proceeds of the sale of the Notes has been or will be used to finance a
Hostile Tender Offer.

         8J. ERISA. No accumulated funding deficiency (as defined in Section 302
of ERISA and Section 412 of the Code), whether or not waived, exists with
respect to any Plan (other than a Multiemployer Plan). No liability to the
Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation has been or is expected by the Company or
any ERISA Affiliate to be incurred with respect to any Plan (other than a
Multiemployer Plan) by the Company, any Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate which
could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. Neither the
Company, any Subsidiary nor any ERISA Affiliate has incurred or presently
expects to incur any withdrawal liability under Title IV of ERISA with respect
to any Multiemployer Plan which could reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
issuance and sale of the Notes will be exempt from or will not involve any
transaction which is subject to the prohibitions of Section 406 of ERISA and
will not involve any transaction in connection with which a penalty could be
imposed under Section 502(i) of ERISA or a tax could be imposed pursuant to
Section 4975 of the Code. The representation by the Company in the next
preceding sentence is made in reliance upon and subject to the accuracy of the
representation of each Purchaser in paragraph 9B as to the source of funds to be
used by it to purchase any Notes.

         8K.Governmental Consent. Neither the nature of the Company or of any
Subsidiary, nor any of their respective businesses or properties, nor any
relationship between the Company or any Subsidiary and any other Person, nor any
circumstance in connection with the offering, issuance, sale or delivery of the
Notes is such as to require any authorization, consent, approval, exemption or
any action by or notice to or filing with any court or administrative or
governmental body (other than routine filings after the Closing Day for any
Notes with the Securities and Exchange Commission and/or state Blue Sky
authorities) in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
the offering, issuance, sale or delivery of the Notes or fulfillment of or
compliance with the terms and provisions hereof or of the Notes.

         8L.Environmental Compliance.

               (i)      The Company and its Subsidiaries and all of their
         respective Properties have complied at all times (during such period of
         time the Company or its Subsidiaries have owned or operated each such
         Property) and in all respects with all Environmental Requirements where
         failure to comply could reasonably be expected to have a Material
         Adverse Effect.

               (ii)     Except as set forth in Schedule 8L, neither the Company
         nor any of its Subsidiaries (i) has failed to comply with any
         Environmental Requirement or to obtain, maintain or comply with any
         permit, license or other approval required under any Environmental
         Requirement that could reasonably be expected to have, either

                                       35

<PAGE>

         individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect, (ii) is
         subject to any Environmental Liability or Environmental Requirement
         that could reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in
         the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect, (iii) has received notice of
         any claim with respect to any Environmental Liability that could
         reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the
         aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect or (iv) knows of any basis for any

         this Agreement, whether or not such proposed modification shall be
         effected or proposed consent granted; provided, however, that in

         shall agree to use the Facility Fee paid by the Company under paragraph
         2J(1) to pay all or a portion of such fees and expenses; and

               (iii)    the costs and expenses, including fees and expenses of
         legal counsel incurred by you, any other Purchaser or any Transferee in

or portion thereof or interest therein by any Purchaser or any Transferee and
the payment of any Note.

         11C. Consent to Amendments. This Agreement may be amended, and the
Company may take any action herein prohibited, or omit to perform any act herein
required to be performed by it, if the Company shall obtain the written consent
to such amendment, action or omission to act, of the Required Holder(s) of the
Notes of each Series except that, (i) with the written consent of the holders of
all Notes of a particular Series, and if an Event of Default shall have occurred
and be continuing, of the holders of all Notes of all Series, at the time
outstanding (and not without such written consents), the Notes of such Series
may be amended or the provisions thereof waived to change the maturity thereof,
to change or affect the principal thereof, or to change or affect the rate or
time of payment of interest on or any Yield-Maintenance Amount payable with
respect to the Notes of such Series, (ii) without the written consent of the
holder or holders of all Notes at the time outstanding, no amendment to or
waiver of the provisions of this Agreement shall change or affect the provisions
of paragraph 7A or this paragraph 11C insofar as such provisions relate to
proportions of the principal amount of the Notes of any Series, or the rights of
any individual holder of Notes, required with respect to any declaration of
Notes to be due and payable or with respect to any consent, amendment, waiver or
declaration, (iii) with the written consent of Prudential (and not without the
written consent of Prudential) the provisions of paragraph 2 may be amended or
waived (except insofar as any such amendment or waiver would affect any rights
or obligations with respect to the purchase and sale of Notes which shall have
become Accepted Notes prior to such amendment or waiver), and (iv) with the
written consent of all of the Purchasers which shall have become obligated to
purchase Accepted Notes of any Series (and not without the written consent of
all such Purchasers), any of the provisions of paragraphs 2 and 3 may be amended
or waived insofar as such amendment or waiver would affect only rights or
obligations with respect to the purchase and sale of the Accepted Notes of such
Series or the terms and provisions of such Accepted Notes. Each holder of any
Note at the time or thereafter outstanding shall be bound by any consent
authorized by this paragraph 11C, whether or not such Note shall have been
marked to indicate such consent, but any Notes issued thereafter may bear a
notation referring to any such consent. No course of dealing between the Company
and the holder of any Note nor any delay in exercising any rights hereunder or
under any Note shall operate as a waiver of any rights of any holder of such
Note. As used herein and in the Notes, the term "this Agreement" and references
thereto shall mean this Agreement as it may from time to time be amended or
supplemented. Prior to its effectiveness, any amendment, waiver or consent shall
be in writing and executed by the Company and the Required Holders or the
holders of all Notes, as applicable.

         11D. Form and Registration; Transfer and Exchange; Transfer
Restrictions; Lost Notes.

         11D(1) Form and Registration. The Notes are issuable as registered
notes without coupons in denominations of at least $1,000,000, except as may be
necessary to reflect any principal amount not evenly divisible by $1,000,000.
The Company shall keep at its principal office a register in which the Company
shall provide for the registration of Notes and of transfers of Notes. Upon
surrender for registration of transfer of any Note at the principal office of
the Company, the Company shall, at its expense, execute and deliver one or more
new Notes of like tenor and of a like aggregate principal amount, registered in
the name of such transferee or transferees.

                                       58

<PAGE>

         11D(2) Transfer and Exchange of Notes. At the option of the holder of
any Note, such Note may be exchanged for other Notes of like tenor and of any
authorized denominations, of a like aggregate principal amount, upon surrender
of the Note to be exchanged at the principal office of the Company. Whenever any
Notes are so surrendered for exchange, the Company shall, at its expense,
execute and deliver the Notes which the holder making the exchange is entitled
to receive. Each installment of principal payable on each installment date upon
each new Note issued upon any such transfer or exchange shall be in the same
proportion to the unpaid principal amount of such new Note as the installment of
principal payable on such date on the Note surrendered for registration of
transfer or exchange bore to the unpaid principal amount of such Note. No
reference need be made in any such new Note to any installment or installments
of principal previously due and paid upon the Note surrendered for registration
of transfer or exchange. Every Note surrendered for registration of transfer or
exchange shall be duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument of
transfer duly executed, by the holder of such Note or such holder's attorney
duly authorized in writing. Any Note or Notes issued in exchange for any Note or
upon transfer thereof shall carry the rights to unpaid interest and interest to
accrue which were carried by the Note so exchanged or transferred, so that
neither gain nor loss of interest shall result from any such transfer or
exchange.

         11D(3) Lost Notes. Upon receipt of written notice from the holder of
any Note of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of such Note and, in the
case of any such loss, theft or destruction, upon receipt of such holder's
unsecured indemnity agreement, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
the Company, or in the case of any such mutilation upon surrender and
cancellation of such Note, the Company will make and deliver a new Note, of like
tenor, in lieu of the lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated Note.

         11E. Persons Deemed Owners; Participations. Prior to due presentment
for registration of transfer, the Company may treat the Person in whose name any
Note is registered as the owner and holder of such Note for the purpose of
receiving payment of principal of and interest on, and any Yield-Maintenance
Amount payable with respect to, such Note and for all other purposes whatsoever,
whether or not such Note shall be overdue, and the Company shall not be affected
by notice to the contrary. Subject to the preceding sentence, the holder of any
Note may from time to time grant participations in all or any part of such Note
to any Person on such terms and conditions as may be determined by such holder
in its sole and absolute discretion.

         11F. Survival of Representations and Warranties; Entire Agreement. All
representations and warranties contained herein or made in writing by or on
behalf of the Company in connection herewith shall survive the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the Notes, the transfer by any Purchaser of any
Note or portion thereof or interest therein and the payment of any Note, and may
be relied upon by any Transferee, regardless of any investigation made at any
time by or on behalf of any Purchaser or any Transferee. Subject to the
preceding sentence, this Agreement and the Notes embody the entire agreement and
understanding between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter
hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings relating to such
subject matter.

         11G. Successors and Assigns. All covenants and other agreements in this
Agreement contained by or on behalf of any of the parties hereto shall bind and
inure to the benefit of the

                                       59

<PAGE>

respective successors and assigns of the parties hereto (including, without
limitation, any Transferee) whether so expressed or not.

         11H. Independence of Covenants. All covenants hereunder shall be given
independent effect so that if a particular action or condition is prohibited by
any one of such covenants, the fact that it would be permitted by an exception
to, or otherwise be in compliance within the limitations of, another covenant
shall not avoid the occurrence of a Default or Event of Default if such action
is taken or such condition exists.

         11I. Notices. All written communications provided for hereunder (other
than communications provided for under paragraph 2) shall be sent by first class
mail or nationwide overnight delivery service (with charges prepaid) and (i) if
to any Purchaser, addressed as specified for such communications in the
Purchaser Schedule attached to the applicable Confirmation of Acceptance (in the
case of any Shelf Notes) or at such other address as any such Purchaser shall
have specified to the Company in writing, (ii) if to any other holder of any
Note, addressed to it at such address as it shall have specified in writing to

provided, however, that any such communication to the Company may also, at the
option of the Person sending such communication, be delivered by any other means
either to the Company at its address specified above or to any Authorized
Officer of the Company. Any communication pursuant to paragraph 2 shall be made
by the method specified for such communication in paragraph 2, and shall be
effective to create any rights or obligations under this Agreement only if, in
the case of a telephone communication, an Authorized Officer of the party
conveying the information and of the party receiving the information are parties
to the telephone call, and in the case of a telecopier communication, the
communication is signed by an Authorized Officer of the party conveying the
information, addressed to the attention of an Authorized Officer of the party
receiving the information, and in fact received at the telecopier terminal the
number of which is listed for the party receiving the communication in the
Information Schedule or at such other telecopier terminal as the party receiving
the information shall have specified in writing to the party sending such
information.

         11J. Payments Due on Non-Business Days. Anything in this Agreement or
the Notes to the contrary notwithstanding, any payment of principal of or
interest on, or Yield-Maintenance Amount payable with respect to, any Note that
is due on a date other than a Business Day shall be made on the next succeeding
Business Day. If the date for any payment is extended to the next succeeding
Business Day by reason of the preceding sentence, the period of such extension
shall be included in the computation of the interest payable on such Business
Day.

         11K. Severability. Any provision of this Agreement which is prohibited
or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be
ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without
invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or
unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render
unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.

         11L. Descriptive Headings. The descriptive headings of the several
paragraphs of this Agreement are inserted for convenience only and do not
constitute a part of this Agreement.

         11M. Satisfaction Requirement. If any agreement, certificate or other
writing, or any action taken or to be taken, is by the terms of this Agreement
required to be satisfactory to any Purchaser, to any holder of Notes or to the
Required Holder(s), the determination of such satisfaction shall be made by such
Purchaser, such holder or the Required Holder(s), as the case may be, in the
sole and exclusive judgment (exercised in good faith) of the Person or Persons
making such determination.

         11N. Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction. This Agreement shall be
construed and enforced in accordance with, and the rights of the Parties shall
be governed by, the Internal Law of the State of New York. THE COMPANY HEREBY
SUBMITS TO THE JURISDICTION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK
LOCATED IN NEW YORK COUNTY, NEW YORK AND THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR
THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK AND IRREVOCABLY AGREES THAT, SUBJECT TO THE
SOLE AND ABSOLUTE ELECTION OF THE REQUIRED HOLDER(S) AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED
BY APPLICABLE LAW, ALL ACTIONS OR PROCEEDINGS RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
NOTES SHALL BE LITIGATED IN SUCH COURTS, AND THE COMPANY WAIVES ANY OBJECTION
WHICH IT MAY HAVE BASED ON IMPROPER VENUE OR FORUM NON CONVENIENS TO THE CONDUCT
OF ANY PROCEEDING IN ANY SUCH COURTS.

         11O. Severalty of Obligations. The sales of Notes to the Purchasers are
to be several sales, and the obligations of Prudential and the Purchasers under
this Agreement are several obligations. No failure by Prudential or any
Purchaser to perform its obligations under this Agreement shall relieve
Prudential, any other Purchaser or the Company of any of its obligations
hereunder, and neither Prudential nor any Purchaser shall be responsible for the
obligations of, or any action taken or omitted by, any other such Person
hereunder.

         11P. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each of which shall be an original, but all of which together

<PAGE>

         11Q. Rank. The parties hereto, for their own benefit and not for the
benefit or for the purpose of creating any duty, obligation or liability to any
other Person, expressly designate that the right to payment of the Notes shall
be pari passu to the Bank Agreement in right of payment and performance.

         11R. Binding Agreement. When this Agreement is executed and delivered
by the Company and Prudential, it shall become a binding agreement between the
Company and Prudential. This Agreement shall also inure to the benefit of each
Purchaser which shall have executed and delivered a Confirmation of Acceptance,
and each such Purchaser shall be bound by this Agreement to the extent provided
in such Confirmation of Acceptance.

                                        Very truly yours,

                                        WATSCO, INC.
