BORROWER:   FAFCO, INC.                          LENDER: BUTTE COMMUNITY BANK

            CHICO, CA 95928                              2041 FOREST AVE
                                                         CHICO, CA 95928

================================================================================

             PRINCIPAL AMOUNT: $1,000,000.00  INITIAL RATE: 6.250%
                       DATE OF AGREEMENT: AUGUST 8, 2002

DESCRIPTION OF EXISTING INDEBTEDNESS. THIS IS A VARIABLE RATE (1.500% OVER PRIME
RATE AS PUBLISHED BY BUTTE COMMUNITY BANK, MAKING AN INITIAL RATE OF 6.250%),
NONDISCLOSABLE REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT LOAN TO A CORPORATION FOR $1,500,000.00
DUE ON AUGUST 10, 2002.

DESCRIPTION OF COLLATERAL. UCC FILING ON ALL INVENTORY, CHATTEL PAPER,
ACCOUNTS/CONTRACT RIGHTS, EQUIPMENT, GENERAL INTANGIBLES AND FIXTURES.

DESCRIPTION OF CHANGE IN TERMS. EXTEND MATURITY DATE FROM AUGUST 10, 2002 TO
AUGUST 10, 2003. DECREASE IN MAXIMUM CREDIT AMOUNT FROM $1,500,000.00 TO
$1,000,000.00. ALL OTHER TERMS AND CONDITIONS ARE TO REMAIN THE SAME.

PROMISE TO PAY. FAFCO, INC. ("Borrower") promises to pay to Butte Community Bank
("Lender"), or order, in lawful money of the United States of America, the
principal amount of One Million & 00/100 Dollars ($1,000,000.00) or so much as
may be outstanding, together with interest on the unpaid outstanding principal
balance on each advance. Interest shall be calculated from the date of each
advance until repayment of each advance.

PAYMENT. Borrower will pay this loan on demand. Payment in full is due
immediately upon Lender's demand. If no demand is made, Borrower will pay this
loan in one payment of all outstanding principal plus all accrued unpaid
interest on August 10, 2003. In addition, Borrower will pay regular monthly
payments of all accrued unpaid interest due as of each payment date, beginning
August 10, 2002, with all subsequent interest payments to be due on the same day
of each month after that. Interest on this Agreement is computed on a 365/360
simple interest basis; that is, by applying the ratio of the annual interest
rate over a year of 360 days, multiplied by the outstanding principal balance,
multiplied by the actual number of days the principal balance is outstanding.
Borrower will pay Lender at Lender's address shown above or at such other place
as Lender may designate in writing.

VARIABLE INTEREST RATE. The interest rate on this Agreement is subject to change
from time to time based on changes in an index which is Lender's Prime Rate (the
"Index"). This is the rate Lender charges, or would charge, on 90-day unsecured
loans to the most creditworthy corporate customers. This rate may or may not be
the lowest rate available from Lender at any given time. Lender will tell
Borrower the current index rate upon Borrower's request. The interest rate
change will not occur more often than each DAY. Borrower understands that Lender
may make loans based on other rates as well. The Index currently is 4.750% per
annum. The interest rate to be applied to the unpaid principal balance of the
Note will be at a rate of 1.500 percentage points over the index, resulting in
an initial rate of 6.250% per annum. NOTICE: Under no circumstances will the
interest rate on the Note be more than the maximum rate allowed by applicable
law.

PREPAYMENT; MINIMUM INTEREST CHARGE. In any event, even upon full prepayment of
this Agreement, Borrower understands that Lender is entitled to a minimum
interest charge of $60.00. Other than Borrower's obligation to pay any minimum
interest charge, Borrower may pay without penalty all or a portion of the amount
owed earlier than it is due. Early payments will not, unless agreed to by Lender
in writing, relieve Borrower of Borrower's obligation to continue to make
payments of accrued unpaid interest. Rather, early payments will reduce the
principal balance due. Borrower agrees not to send Lender payments marked "paid
in full", "without recourse", or similar language. If Borrower sends such a
payment, Lender may accept it without losing any of Lender's rights under this
Agreement, and Borrower will remain obligated to pay any further amount owed to
Lender. All written communications concerning disputed amounts, including any
check or other payment instrument that indicates that the payment constitutes
"payment in full" of the amount owed or that is tendered with other conditions
or limitations or as full satisfaction of a disputed amount must be mailed or
delivered to: Butte Community Bank, CHICO OFFICE, 2041 FOREST AVE, CHICO, CA
95928.

LATE CHARGE. If a payment is 10 days or more late, Borrower will be charged
5.000% of the regularly scheduled payment or $5.00, whichever is greater.

INTEREST AFTER DEFAULT. Upon Borrower's failure to pay all amounts declared due
pursuant to this section, including failure to pay upon final maturity, the
total sum due under this Agreement will bear interest from the date of
acceleration or maturity at the variable interest rate on this Agreement.

DEFAULT. Each of the following shall constitute an Event of Default under this
Agreement.

         PAYMENT DEFAULT. Borrower fails to make any payment when due under the
         indebtedness.

         OTHER DEFAULTS. Borrower fails to comply with or to perform any other
         term, obligation, covenant or condition contained in this Agreement or
         in any of the Related Documents or to comply with or to perform any
         term, obligation, covenant or condition contained in any other
         agreement between Lender and Borrower.

         FALSE STATEMENTS. Any warranty, representation or statement made or
         furnished to Lender by Borrower or on Borrower's behalf under this
         Agreement or the Related Documents is false or misleading in any
         material respect, either now or at the time made or furnished or
         becomes false or misleading at any time thereafter.

         INSOLVENCY. The dissolution or termination of Borrower's existence as a
         going business, the insolvency of Borrower, the appointment of a
         receiver for any part of Borrower's property, any assignment for the
         benefit of creditors, any type of creditor workout, or the commencement
         of any proceeding under any bankruptcy or insolvency laws by or against
         Borrower.

         CREDITOR OR FORFEITURE PROCEEDINGS. Commencement of foreclosure or
         forfeiture proceedings, whether by judicial proceeding, self-help,
         repossession or any other method, by any creditor or Borrower or by any
         governmental agency against any collateral securing the indebtedness.
         This includes a garnishment of any of Borrower's accounts, including
         deposit accounts, with Lender. However, this Event of Default shall not
         apply if there is a good faith dispute by Borrower as to the validity
         or reasonableness of the claim which is the basis of the creditor or
         forfeiture proceedings and if Borrower gives Lender written notice of
         the creditor or forfeiture proceeding and deposits with Lender monies
         or a surely bond for the creditor or forfeiture proceeding, in an
         amount determined by Lender, in its sole discretion, as being an
         adequate reserve or bond for the dispute.

         EVENTS AFFECTING GUARANTOR. Any of the preceding events occurs with
         respect to any guarantor, endorser, surety, or accommodation party of
         any of the indebtedness or any guarantor, endorser, surety, or
         accommodation party dies or becomes incompetent, or revokes or
         disputes the validity of, or liability under, any Guaranty of the
         indebtedness evidenced by this Note. In the event of a death, Lender,
         at its option, may, but shall not be required to, permit the
         guarantor's estate to assume unconditionally the obligations arising
         under the guaranty in a manner satisfactory to Lender, and, in doing
         so, cure any Event of Default.

         CHANGE IN OWNERSHIP. Any change in ownership of twenty-five percent
         (25%) or more of the common stock of Borrower.

         ADVERSE CHANGE. A material adverse change occurs in Borrower's
         financial condition, or Lender believes the prospect of payment or
         performance of the indebtedness is impaired.

         INSECURITY.  Lender in good faith believes itself insecure.

         CURE PROVISIONS. If any default, other than a default in payment is
         curable and if Borrower has not been given a notice of a breach of the
         same provision of this Agreement within the preceding twelve (12)
         months, it may be cured (and no event of default will have occurred) if
         Borrower, after receiving written notice from Lender demanding cure of
         such default: (1) cures the default within fifteen (15) days; or (2) if
         the cure requires more than fifteen (15) days, immediately initiates
         steps which Lender deems in Lender's sole discretion to be sufficient
         to cure the default and thereafter continues and completes all
         reasonable and necessary steps sufficient to produce compliance as soon
         as reasonably practical.

LENDER'S RIGHTS. Upon default, Lender may declare the entire unpaid principal
balance on this Agreement and all accrued unpaid interest immediately due, and
then Borrower will pay that amount.

ATTORNEYS' FEES; EXPENSES. Lender may hire or pay someone else to help collect
this Agreement if Borrower does not pay. Borrower will pay Lender that amount.
This includes, subject to any limits under applicable law, Lender's attorneys'
fees and Lender's legal expenses, whether or not there is a lawsuit, including
attorneys' fees, expenses for bankruptcy proceedings (including efforts to
modify or vacate any automatic stay or injunction), and appeals. Borrower also

California. This Agreement has been accepted by Lender in the State of
California.

CHOICE OF VENUE. If there is a lawsuit, Borrower agrees upon Lender's request to
submit to the jurisdiction of the courts of BUTTE County, State of California.

DISHONORED ITEM FEE. Borrower will pay a fee to Lender of $10.00 if Borrower
makes a payment on Borrower's loan and the check or preauthorized charge with
which Borrower pays is later dishonored.

RIGHT OF SETOFF. To the extent permitted by applicable law, Lender reserves a
right of setoff in all Borrower's accounts with Lender (whether checking,
savings, or some other account). This includes all accounts Borrower holds
jointly with someone else and all accounts Borrower may open in the future.
However, this does not include any IRA or Keogh accounts, or any trust accounts
for which setoff would be prohibited by law. Borrower authorizes Lender, to the
extent permitted by applicable law, to charge or setoff all sums owing on the
indebtedness against any and all such accounts.

COLLATERAL. Borrower acknowledges this Agreement is secured by the following
collateral described in the security instrument listed herein: inventory,
chattel paper, accounts, equipment, general intangibles and fixtures described
in a Commercial Security Agreement dated August 8, 2002.

LINE OF CREDIT. This Agreement evidences a revolving line of credit. Advances
under this Agreement may be requested orally by Borrower or as provided in this
paragraph. Lender may, but need not, require that all oral requests be confirmed
in writing. All communications, instructions, or directions by telephone or
otherwise to Lender are to be directed to Lender's office shown above. The
following persons currently are authorized to request advances and authorize
payments under the line of credit until Lender receives from Borrower, at
Lender's address shown above, written notice of revocation of their authority:
ALEX N. WATT, Executive VP/Secretary of FAFCO, INC.; NANCY I. GARVIN, Vice
President of Finance of FAFCO, INC.; and FREEMAN A. FORD, President of FAFCO,
INC. Borrower agrees to be liable for all sums either: (A) advanced in
accordance with the instructions of an authorized person or (B) credited to any
of Borrower's accounts with Lender. The unpaid principal balance owing on this
Agreement at any time may be evidenced by endorsements on this Agreement or by
Lender's internal records, including daily computer print-outs. Lender will have
no obligation to advance funds under this Agreement if: (A) Borrower or any
guarantor is in default under the terms of this Agreement or any agreement that
Borrower or any guarantor has with Lender, including any agreement made in
connection with the signing of this Agreement; (B) Borrower or any guarantor
ceases doing business or is insolvent; (C) any guarantor seeks, claims or
otherwise attempts to limit, modify or revoke such guarantor's guarantee of this
Agreement or any other loan with Lender; (D) Borrower has applied funds provided
pursuant to this Agreement for purposes other than those authorized by Lender;
or (E) Lender in good faith believes itself insecure.

CONTINUING VALIDITY. Except as expressly changed by this Agreement, the terms of
the original obligation or obligations, including all agreements evidenced or
securing the obligation(s), remain unchanged and in full force and effect.
Consent by Lender to this Agreement does not waive Lender's right to strict
performance of the obligation(s) as changed, nor obligate Lender to make any
future change in terms. Nothing in this Agreement will constitute a satisfaction
of the obligation(s). It is the intention of Lender to retain as liable parties
all makers and endorsers of the original obligation(s), including accommodation
parties, unless a party is expressly released by Lender in writing. Any maker or
endorser, including accommodation makers, will not be released by virtue of this
Agreement. If any person who signed the original obligation does not sign this
Agreement below, then all persons signing below acknowledge that this Agreement
is given conditionally, based on the representation to Lender that the
non-signing party consents to the changes and provisions of this Agreement or
otherwise will not be released by it. This waiver applies not only to any
initial extension, modification or release, but also to all such subsequent
actions.

SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS. Subject to any limitations stated in this Agreement on
transfer of Borrower's interest, this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
to the benefit of the parties, their successors and assigns. If ownership of the
Collateral becomes vested in a person other than Borrower, Lender, without
notice to Borrower, may deal with Borrower's successors with reference to this
Agreement and the indebtedness by way of forbearance or extension without
releasing Borrower from the obligations of this Agreement or liability under the
indebtedness.

MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS. This Agreement is payable on demand. The inclusion of
specific default provisions or rights of Lender shall not preclude Lender's
right to declare payment of this Agreement on its demand. Lender may delay or
forgo enforcing any of its rights or remedies under this Agreement without
losing them. Borrower and any other person who signs, guarantees or endorses
this Agreement, to the extent allowed by law, waive any applicable statute of
limitations, presentment, demand for payment, and notice of dishonor. Upon any
change in the terms of this Agreement, and unless otherwise expressly stated in
writing, no party who signs this Agreement, whether as maker, guarantor,
accommodation maker or endorser, shall be released from liability. All such
parties agree that Lender may renew or extend (repeatedly and for any length of
time) this loan or release any party or guarantor or collateral; or impair, fail
to realize upon or perfect Lender's security interest in the collateral; and
take any other action deemed necessary by Lender without the consent of or
notice to anyone. All such parties also agree that Lender may modify this loan
without the consent of or notice to anyone other than the party with whom the
modification is made. The obligations under this Agreement are joint and
several.
