"Facility"), which Facility will provide outpatient dialysis services;

         WHEREAS, the Facility is an outpatient dialysis facility certified by
the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services ("CMS") for payment under the
Medicare program, which program requires the Facility to obtain the services of
a physician or group of physicians to perform prescribed medical director
services for the Facility;

         WHEREAS, the Company desires to engage one or more nephrologists
skilled in dialysis center administration to provide medical director services
at the Facility in accordance with the requirements established by CMS and as

director services contemplated by this Agreement to the Facility through one or
more of its Practice Physicians, each of whom will be licensed to Practice
medicine and prescribe drugs without restriction in the State of Texas, will
specialize in nephrology and dialysis services and will be experienced in
dialysis center administration;

         WHEREAS, the Practice has provided medical director services at the
Facility since May 1, 2000, when the Facility opened, pursuant to an oral
agreement, while the terms of this Agreement were being finalized.

the mutual covenants and agreements of the parties set forth in this Agreement,
the receipt and sufficiency of which are acknowledged, the parties agree as

amended or supplemented, together with such other services as are customarily
performed by medical directors at high quality dialysis facilities and such

I, the Practice shall provide the medical director services described in EXHIBIT
A, which may be revised and updated from time to time by the Company, provided
that any change that is not a CMS or other legal requirement must first be
approved by the Practice if it materially increases the medical director duties
hereunder.

         1.3 Principal Contact. The Practice shall from time to time designate
in writing to the Company a Practice Physician to serve as the principal contact
at the Facility and who shall provide or arrange for the provision of the

will be Roy Gerard, M.D.

         1.4 Patient Care Manual. The Practice shall advise the Company in
developing and maintaining a patient care policy and procedures manual for the
Facility and will assure its implementation by delegating to the supervising
nurse the duty to oversee the implementation of the policies and providing
medical guidance when needed. The manual will describe:

               (a) The types of dialysis used in the Facility and the procedures
to be followed in performing each type of dialysis;

               (b) Procedures for implementing universal precautions for the

guidance to the supervising nurse in the execution of these duties.

         1.6 Records. The Company and the Practice acknowledge that attending
physicians have medical responsibility for the content of medical records of the
Facility pertinent to the care of their patients. Furthermore, the Company and
the Practice acknowledge that the head nurse or manager of the Facility has

records including records of nurses, technicians, dieticians and social workers
providing services in the Facility. The Company, through a medical records
supervisor designated for the Facility, with the assistance and support of the
Practice shall oversee the maintenance of current medical and business records
relating to the care and treatment of patients in the Facility in accordance
with 42 CFR 405.2139 and 25 TAC ss. 117.45 and in accordance with Company
policies and applicable regulations of governmental agencies, including:

services hereunder shall maintain, and provide to the Company upon request,
reasonably complete and detailed documentation of the



<PAGE>

services performed in providing medical director services under this Agreement.
This documentation shall be maintained in a form reasonably satisfactory to or
prescribed by the Company and, at the reasonable request of the Company, will
include documentation of the time spent performing services under this
Agreement.

         1.8 Medical Staff. The Practice shall review the applications of
physicians requesting to attend to patients at the Facility and forward a
recommendation concerning such applications to the body making credentialing
decisions for the Facility under its Professional Staff Bylaws. Subject to the
Facility's Professional Staff Bylaws, a member of the Practice shall, at the
request of the Company or the Executive Board of the Medical Staff acting under
such bylaws, serve on the peer review committee that maintains oversight of all
disciplinary actions with regard to any matter of such physicians or patient
care personnel as needed to assure the quality of services and conformity to
Company and Facility rules and policies.

         1.9 Coverage. The Practice shall make available one or more Practice
Physicians, as appropriate, to provide medical director services at the Facility
for its hours of operation. The Practice and the Company shall confer from time
to time in good faith concerning the appropriate level of physician coverage to
provide medical director services hereunder.

         1.10 Practice Physicians. (a) The Practice represents and warrants that
all physicians who as of the date of this Agreement meet the definition of a
Practice Physician have executed the Physician Joinder attached hereto. As a
condition to engaging any physician in a manner that causes such physician to
become a Practice Physician, the Practice shall obtain the signature of such
physician on the Physician Joinder in consideration for such engagement the fees
payable to the Practice hereunder.

               (b) For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Practice Physician"
means any physician who is a physician performing services on behalf of the
Practice at any of the Facilities (whether as an employee, partner, member,
shareholder or independent contractor of the Practice), any other physician
performing services on behalf of the Practice hereunder (as may be approved by
the Company), and any other physician in any way affiliated or associated with
the Practice, or regularly seeing patients of the Practice (other than on a
covering or locum tenens basis).

         1.11 No Required Referrals. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, each of the Company, the Practice and the Practice Physicians
acknowledges and agrees that neither the Practice nor any Practice Physician is
required to make referrals of patients to the Company or any affiliate of the
Company or to the Facility. Each of the Practice Physicians is free to maintain
professional staff privileges at any dialysis facility, to refer patients to any
other facility for dialysis or other services, and, subject to Article VII,
otherwise to perform professional medical services at or through any entity,
whether or not it is competing with the Facility, the Company or with any
affiliates of the Company.

         1.12 Personnel. The Company and the Practice acknowledge that the
Practice has no control over the processes of hiring or firing of associates
employed at the Facility. The Company and the Practice further acknowledge and
agree that the Practice's involvement in the training of associates is confined
to providing advice and counsel to the Company.

breach with reasonable particularity.


<PAGE>

               (b) Upon the occurrence of any event described in paragraph (a)
of this Section 2.4 that is the result of an act or omission of one or more
specific Practice Physicians who do not constitute a majority of the Practice
Physicians then providing services hereunder, the Company shall not terminate
this Agreement if, within 10 days after the Company gives the Practice written
notice of the act or omission giving the Company the right to terminate this
Agreement, the Practice agrees that any Practice Physician who is the subject of
such cause will not provide further services under this Agreement and, if
requested by the Company, that the Practice will use its best efforts to cause
such physician to resign the privileges of such Practice Physician to attend
patients at the Facility.

               (c) Upon the occurrence of any event described in paragraph (a)

expiration of this Agreement or its termination for any reason, the Practice
shall not interfere with any efforts by the Company to contract with any other
individual or entity for the provision of medical director services. Expiration
or termination of this Agreement shall not affect any rights or obligations of
the parties accruing hereunder through the date of expiration or termination,
including the Company's obligation to compensate Practice for medical director
services pro-rated through such date, and such rights and obligations shall
survive expiration or termination.

                                   ARTICLE III
                                  COMPENSATION

         3.1 Compensation.

               (a) In consideration of the services, covenants, and agreements
agreed to be performed by the Practice during the Initial Term and any Renewal
Term, beginning on the commencement of operations at the Facility, the Company
shall pay the Practice $25,000 per year for the year from the Effective Date
until the first anniversary thereof and $30,000 per year after such first
anniversary. Such medical director fee shall be payable in substantially equal
monthly installments in arrears on or before the 15th day of each month for
services rendered during the preceding month. In addition to the monthly medical
director fee prescribed above for years beginning on and after January 1, 2002,
the Practice shall be eligible for an annual bonus of up to 15% of the base
annual medical director fee payable hereunder based upon the success of the
Facility in meeting annual clinical outcomes targets and in achieving
performance objectives for the Facility and the Practice generally prescribed by
RCG for its dialysis facilities in the region in which the Facility is located.
The criteria for reviewing and determining the bonus amount will bee attached
hereto as EXHIBIT C. RCG may change such criteria annually, and the Company will
provide the revised criteria to the Practice when adopted. The Practice's
performance relative to these criteria will be evaluated as part of the peer
review and quality assurance process for the South Central Region of RCG. The
Practice agrees to accept the payment under this subsection (a) (as it may be
adjusted as provided below) as the total compensation for all services,
covenants and agreements pursuant to this Agreement.


<PAGE>

               (b) (i) If either party believes that the fair market value of
the services provided by the Practice under this Agreement has changed in any
material way since the most recent anniversary of the Effective Date (or since
the Effective Date with respect to the first anniversary), then such party may
notify the other that it believes such a change has occurred and the Practice
and the Company shall negotiate in good faith an adjustment to the compensation
described in Section 3.1(a) above so that it represents fair market value for
the duties and responsibilities of the Practice to be provided during the next
year under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no adjustment pursuant
to this subsection (b)(i) to the compensation payable under this Agreement shall
be effective unless set forth in writing signed by each of the Practice and the
Company, which writing shall be deemed an amendment to this Agreement.

                    (ii) If the Practice and the Company are unable to agree on
an adjustment, then either may require that an adjustment of the compensation
hereunder be submitted to a qualified independent third party mutually selected
by both the Practice and the Company to determine the fair market value of the
services required hereunder, the costs and fees of which shall be borne equally
by the Practice and the Company. If the Practice and the Company are unable to
agree on the third party, then each such party shall at its own cost and expense
select its own qualified independent third party and the average of such two
determinations of fair market value shall be the revised compensation unless
such determinations are more than 10% apart, in which case such third parties
shall mutually select an additional qualified independent third party, the fees
and expenses of which shall be shared equally, who shall determine the fair
market value of the services hereunder from between the range of the amounts
determined by the first two appraisals. The fair market value of the services as
determined in accordance with the provisions of this subsection (b)(ii) shall be
the compensation payable under this Agreement effective as of the applicable
anniversary of the Effective Date, and such final determination shall be deemed
an amendment to this Agreement.

               (c) Any change to the compensation payable hereunder in
accordance with subsection (b) of this Section 3.1 shall be effective as of the
applicable anniversary of the Effective Date and shall remain effective, and not
subject to adjustment under Section 3.1(b) or otherwise, for at least 12 months
from the effective date of such change.

         3.2 Expenses. The Company shall be responsible for all reasonable
expenses incurred in the operation of the Facility and the support of the
services provided by Practice hereunder, including appropriate office space and
secretarial support, and shall reimburse the Practice for all reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Practice in attending meetings outside
the service area of the Facility as required or requested by the Company
pursuant to Article I of this Agreement.

                                   ARTICLE IV
                                STATUS OF PARTIES

         4.1 Tax Status. The Company and the Practice acknowledge and agree that
the relationship created under this Agreement between them is that of
independent contractors and that nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to
render either party the employer or employee of the other, agent or principal of
the other, or joint venturer or partner of the other. The parties acknowledge
and agree that the Practice Physicians will be engaged by the Practice and will
under no circumstances be considered the employee(s) of the Company, RCG or the
Facility, or any of their affiliates. The Practice shall be responsible for all
withholding, payroll and similar taxes related to its engagement of the Practice
Physicians, and neither the Practice nor the Practice Physicians shall be
entitled to any benefits afforded to the employees of the Company, RCG or the
Facility, or any of their affiliates. The Practice agrees that (i) neither it
nor any Practice Physician be treated as an employee of the Company for federal
tax purposes; (ii) the Company will not withhold on behalf of the Practice any
sums for income tax, unemployment insurance, social security, or any other
withholding pursuant to any law or requirement of any governmental body; (iii)
all of such taxes, payments and withholdings, if any, are the sole
responsibility of the Practice; and (iv) the Practice will indemnify and hold
the Company and RCG harmless from any and all loss or liability arising with
respect to such benefits, taxes, payments and withholdings, if any. If the
United States Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") should question or challenge the
worker status of the Practice or the Practice Physicians, then the parties agree
that both the Practice and the Company shall have the right to participate in
any discussion or negotiation occurring with the IRS, irrespective of which
party initiated such discussions or negotiations, and each party shall notify
the other in advance of any planned meeting or discussion.

         4.2 No Agency. The Practice shall not have the right or authority to,
and expressly agrees that it will not, enter into any contract in the name of
the Company or otherwise to bind the Company, in any way, without the express
written consent of the Company. The Practice shall indemnify and hold the
Company harmless from any and all loss or liability attributable to a violation
of this covenant. However, the Practice shall advise and assist the Company in
securing and retaining contracts in the name and for the account of the Company
with such individuals or entities necessary for the proper and efficient
functioning of the Company.

         4.3 Access to Records. If it is ultimately determined that ss. 952 of
the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1980 applies to this Agreement, then until the
expiration of four years after the furnishing of services provided under this
Agreement, the Practice will make available to the Secretary of the United
States Department of Health and Human Services, the United States Comptroller
General, and their representatives, this Agreement and all books, documents and
records necessary to certify the nature and extent of the costs of those
services. If the Practice carries out the duties of this Agreement through a
subcontract worth $10,000 or more over a twelve-month period with a related
organization, the subcontract will also contain an access clause to permit
access by the Secretary, Comptroller General, and their representatives to the
related organization's books, documents and records.

         4.4 The Company's Work Product. All operating procedures, protocols,
information systems, operating data, databases, reports and other non-public
proprietary business systems or information owned by the Company or RCG shall be
and remain the exclusive property of the Company or RCG, as appropriate. If the
Practice or any Practice Physician modifies, enhances or alters any of such
property such modification, enhancement or alteration will be deemed a
work-for-hire and shall be the property of the Company or RCG, as appropriate.
The Practice or Practice Physician making such modification, enhancement or
alteration will execute all documents reasonably requested by the Company to
vest fully in the Company or RCG title to such modification, enhancement or
alteration.

coverage shall include coverage of the Practice for acts and omissions in
connection with the performance of duties as medical director under this
Agreement.

satisfactory evidence of the insurance required to be maintained under Sections
5.1 and 5.2. Each party shall notify the other at least 60 days prior to the
voluntary cancellation or termination of any such coverage and immediately upon

                                   ARTICLE VII
                         CONFIDENTIALITY, NONCOMPETITION
                          AND NONSOLICITATION COVENANT

         7.1 Additional Covenants.

               (a) During the term of this Agreement and for a period of two
years after the termination or expiration of this Agreement, the Practice and
each Practice Physician agrees that it, he or she will not in any manner,
directly or indirectly, by itself, himself or herself or in conjunction with any
other person, (i) conduct any of the activities or perform any of the
responsibilities delineated in Article I and EXHIBIT A ("Services") of this
Agreement for any business entity that is competitive with the business of the
Company or (ii) establish or own any financial, beneficial or other interest in
(other than an interest consisting of less than one percent (1%) of a class of a
publicly traded security), make any loan to or for the benefit of, or render any
managerial, marketing or other business advice, to any entity that is then
conducting activities that are competitive with those of the business of the
Company, in either case within a 25-mile radius around the Facility. For
purposes of this Article, the "business of the Company" means owning or
operating a renal



<PAGE>

dialysis center, unit or facility or providing dialysis supplies or services to
any other such center, unit or facility to any home dialysis program, including
the provision of pharmaceuticals or laboratory services related to renal
dialysis.

               By executing a counterpart of this Agreement and in consideration
of the compensation paid to the Practice hereunder, each Practice Physician
agrees to be bound by the terms of this Article VII. With respect to the
Practice Physicians, the two-year time periods applicable to this Article VII
shall begin on the earlier of (i) the termination or expiration of this
Agreement, or (ii) the termination of the employment, independent contractor or
other relationship or affiliation of the Practice Physician with the Practice,
such that such Practice Physician ceases to fall within the definition of a
Practice Physician hereunder and generally ceases to treat patients of the
Practice.

               (b) During the term of this Agreement and for a period of two
years after the termination or expiration of this Agreement, the Practice and
each Practice Physician will use all reasonable efforts to keep confidential and
not to divulge, or allow to be divulged to anyone, or use or otherwise
appropriate for its, his or her own benefit or for the benefit of others, any
knowledge or information of a confidential nature with respect to the business
of the Company, the Company itself, or any of its affiliates, including all
trade secrets, pricing information, marketing information or technical
information (hereinafter referred to as the "Confidential Data"), except for (i)
information that is generally available to the public other than as a result of
a breach of a confidentiality agreement, (ii) information available on a
non-confidential basis from a source other than the Company or its affiliates or
agents, which source itself is not bound by a confidentiality agreement, (iii)
information required to be disclosed by law or pursuant to court order, but only
to the extent such disclosure is necessary to respond to such law or court
order, or (iv) disclosure necessary in order for the Practice to perform its
obligations under this Agreement, but only to the extent such disclosure is
necessary for such performance. Each of the Practice and the Practice Physician
acknowledges and agrees that the prohibitions against disclosure of Confidential
Data recited herein are in addition to, and not in lieu of, any rights or
remedies that the Company may have available pursuant to the laws of any
jurisdiction or at common law to prevent the disclosure of confidential
information or trade secrets, and the enforcement by the Company of its rights
and remedies under to this Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver of any
other rights or available remedies that the Company may possess in law or
equity.

               (c) During the term of this Agreement and for a period of two
years after the termination or expiration of this Agreement, neither the
Practice nor any of the Practice Physicians will, for its, his or her own
benefit or the benefit of others, solicit any person or entity that has or has
had, or disrupt or attempt to disrupt, any relationship, contractual or
otherwise, with the Company (including any patient, payor, physician, provider,
managed care organization or supplier) at any time during the term of this
Agreement for the purpose of assisting or creating such a relationship for any
business entity that is competitive with the business of the Company.

               (d) During the term of this Agreement and for a period of two
years after the termination of this Agreement, neither the Practice nor any of
the Practice Physicians will induce, or attempt to induce, any employee of the
Company or any of its affiliates to terminate his or her association with the
Company or any of its affiliates. If any employee of the Company responds to a
general solicitation and seeks employment with the Practice or a Practice
Physician and the Practice or such Practice Physician desires to hire such
employee, then the Practice or such Practice Physician shall give notice of its,
his or her desire to hire such employee and will not offer to hire such employee
until the earlier of seven days after such notice is received by the Company or
the date on which the Company approves such hiring. If the Practice or a
Practice Physician hires an employee of the Company after following the
procedures outlined above, the



<PAGE>

Company may request that the employee continue to provide services to the
Company for up to 30 days to provide for an orderly transition.

               (e) These covenants are considered by the parties hereto to be
fair, reasonable and integral for the protection of the Company. The parties
agree that if a violation of any of these covenants occurs, then (i) such
violation and any threatened violation will cause irreparable injury to the
Company, (ii) the remedy at law for any such violation or threatened violation
will be inadequate, and (iii) the Company will be entitled to injunctive relief
to prevent such violation. The parties acknowledge that these covenants will
survive, and remain in effect and enforceable after, termination of this
Agreement.

               (f) Nothing in this Article VII shall be deemed to prohibit any
Practice Physician from exercising his or her medical judgment concerning the
medical treatment of a patient in any manner whatsoever in any location
whatsoever, and shall not be deemed to require the referral of any such patient
to any facility of the Company or any of its affiliates. The parties acknowledge
and agree that this Agreement shall in no way be deemed to restrict the right or
ability of the Practice and the Practice Physicians to admit and provide
professional service to patients at facilities and institutions other than
facilities of the Company or RCG, including without limitation facilities
operated by business entities that are competitive with the business of the
Company. The Practice and the Practice Physicians acknowledge that enforcement
of this covenant will not prevent any physician of the Practice from earning a
living by practicing medicine or nephrology.

         Any party hereto may change its address specified for notices herein by
designating a new address by notice in accordance with this Section 8.1.

         8.2 Amendments. Subject to Section 8.4, this Agreement may be amended
at any time by mutual agreement of the Practice and the Company hereto, but any
such amendment shall not be operative or valid unless the same is reduced to
writing and approved by the parties hereto.

         8.3 Assignability. This Agreement shall not be assignable by the
Practice, and the Practice shall not assign any of its rights or obligations
under this Agreement without the written consent of the Company. This Agreement
shall not be assignable by the Company, and the Company shall not assign any of
its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the written consent of
the Practice; provided that, without the consent of Practice, the Company may
assign or transfer this Agreement to an affiliate of the Company or RCG or in
connection with a sale of all or substantially all of the assets or business of
the Company; provided that such assets and business are not composed
predominantly of assets of facilities in Tyler, Texas or within 25 miles of
Tyler, Texas.

         8.4 Contract Modifications; Severability.

               (a) This Agreement shall be construed to the fullest extent
possible to be in compliance with and permitted by all Federal (including
Medicare and Medicaid) and state statutes, rules and regulations. If a
Triggering Event (as defined below) occurs, either the Company or the Practice
may by written notice to the other propose an amendment to this Agreement as
necessary to comply with the item giving rise to the Trigger Event. To the
fullest extent possible, any such amendment shall preserve the responsibilities
and duties of the parties and the underlying economic and financial arrangements
between the Company and the Practice with the least changes to the parties'
expectations hereunder. If the Practice and the Company fail to agree to the
form of an amendment within thirty days after the date of such notice, then
either of such party may submit the matter to arbitration as provided in Section
8.9 and any arbitration award shall comply with the second sentence of this
Section, provided that if any resulting change to this Agreement includes a
change to the compensation under Section 3.1(a), then the amount of compensation
shall be determined under the procedures in Section 3.1(b). For purposes of this
Section 8.4, "Triggering Event" means the effectiveness of any statute, rule or
regulation (i) prohibiting the Practice or any of the Practice Physicians from
referring patients (whether Medicare, Medicaid or otherwise) for renal dialysis
either directly or indirectly to the Facilities; (ii) prohibiting the Company,
the Practice or any Practice Physician from submitting claims or receiving
payment under the Medicare, Medicaid or any other third party payment programs
for services rendered to patients at the Facilities; (iii) determining that the
amount or method for determining compensation paid to the Practice hereunder
does not reflect fair market value for the services provided by the Practice
under this Agreement without taking into account the volume or value of
referrals made by the Practice Physicians; or (iv) otherwise rendering illegal
the relationship hereunder between the Company, the Practice and the Practice
Physicians.

               (b) Subject to the provisions of subsection (a) of this Section
8.4, if any provision of this Agreement is held to be illegal, invalid or
unenforceable under present or future laws in effect during the term of this
Agreement, the legality, validity or enforceability of the remaining provisions
of this Agreement shall not be affected thereby.

         8.5 Headings. The headings of this Agreement are inserted for
convenience only and are not to be considered in construction of its provisions.

agreement of the parties with respect to its subject matter, superseding all
prior or contemporaneous agreements, either oral or written.

         8.7 Construction of the Agreement and Binding Effect. Notwithstanding
the place where this Agreement may be executed by any of the parties hereto, the
parties expressly agree that all terms and conditions of this Agreement shall be
construed under and governed by the laws of the State of Texas.

         8.8 Non-Waiver. The failure of either party to exercise any of its
rights under this Agreement for a breach thereof shall not be deemed to be a
waiver of such rights or a waiver of any subsequent breach.

         8.9 Disputes. (a) The parties agree that any dispute arising in
connection with, or relating to, this Agreement or the termination of this
Agreement (other than a dispute related to Sections 3.1(b) or 8.4) shall be
subject to resolution through informal methods. If the parties are unable to
resolve such dispute after thirty days of efforts, then such dispute shall be
submitted to mediation with a singe mediator selected by the parties or, failing
the parties' agreement on a mediator, by JAMS/Endispute. The mediation shall be
conducted in accordance with the rules of JAMS/Endispute. If the parties are
unable to resolve the dispute through mediation, they shall retain all rights
and remedied at applicable law, subject to paragraph (b) below.

         (b) Following the procedures outlined in paragraph (a) above, the
parties agree that any dispute arising in connection with, or relating to, this
Agreement or the termination of this Agreement (other than a dispute related to
Section 3.1(b) and, unless the Company so agrees, a dispute under Article VII),
to the maximum extent allowed by applicable law, shall be subject to arbitration
in accordance with the terms of the Commercial Arbitration Rules for Expedited
Procedures of the American Arbitration Association. A single arbitrator shall be
chosen mutually by the parties from among the Commercial Panel of the American
Arbitration Association. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any party hereto may
seek all available preliminary injunctive or other temporary relief pending the
issuance of an arbitration award. The award of the arbitrator shall contain
findings of fact and conclusions of law and shall be binding and conclusive upon
the parties.

         (c) Any mediation or arbitration under this Agreement shall be held in
Smith County, Texas.

                         personnel employed by the facility.

                                    EXHIBIT C

                       MEDICAL DIRECTOR PERFORMANCE REVIEW

         There has been general agreement regarding the need for a clear set of
guidelines and expectations of an RCG Medical Director. Objectivity in the
annual performance evaluation has been prerequisite, leading to the development
of this document. Our mission is "to improve the quality of life and to care for
those patients with chronic and acute renal disease." This requires that the
dialysis facility and its staff function collaboratively at the highest possible
level, under the leadership of the Medical Director. The Practice's performance
relative to the criteria set forth in this EXHIBIT C will be evaluated as part
of the quality assurance process of RCG's South Central Region. These
performance review criteria are designed to foster continuous improvements in
patient care.

         The Interpretive Guidelines for ESRD Facilities states in V-420
"Treatment is under the general supervision of a Director who is a physician.
The Medical Director is responsible for planning, organizing, conducting and
directing the professional ESRD services and must devote sufficient time to
carrying out these responsibilities." The Nephrologist has the medical skills
and must develop leadership and collaborative management skills to fulfill this
mandate as Medical Director. Teamwork and collegiality are highly valued as the
leader of the ESRD team.

         The measure of performance will be based on a point system as
authorized by the Medical Advisory Board (MAB). The specific criteria and weight
may be changed in the future at the discretion of the MAB. The elements to be
measured and their weight are as follows:

        - 50% based on Clinical Indicators of the Facility
        - 30% based on Medical Director administrative duties
        - 20% based on patient satisfaction with the Facility
