                      EXECUTIVE INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLAN

                                     FY 2003

I.       PURPOSE

         To reward effective executive leadership and performance that
         contributes to Concerto Software's mission of becoming the dominant
         supplier of customer interaction management solutions worldwide.

II.      EFFECTIVE DATE

         The 2003 Executive Incentive Compensation plan year is January 1, 2003
         through and including December 31, 2003.

III.     ELIGIBILITY

         Eligibility for quarterly bonus shall be determined following the
         conclusion of each quarter and is contingent upon continued employment,
         in good standing, on the first day of the quarter through the date of
         earnings release following the quarterly period of bonus eligibility.
         Payments shall be disbursed as soon as administratively practicable
         after the date Concerto Software releases its quarterly financial
         results. Eligibility for annual bonus is contingent upon continued
         employment, in good standing, through and including the date of
         earnings release following the annual period of bonus eligibility. All
         amounts earned under this plan reflect gross dollars and are therefore
         subject to applicable taxation.

IV.      CORPORATE INCENTIVE PLAN

         The 2003 Executive Incentive Plan shall be comprised of 3 bonus
         components:

         .    Quarterly Bonus
         .    Annual Bonus
         .    Over-Achievement Bonus

         The combined incentives at 100% of plan objectives for the combined
         quarterly and annual components shall equate to xx% of the Executive's
         annual base salary.

         A.       Quarterly Bonus

                  The quarterly bonus at 100% of corporate and individual
                  attainment shall equate to 18.75% of the total bonus available
                  under the plan (xx% of annual Base Salary). The maximum
                  quarterly bonus available under the plan is capped at 100% of
                  the quarterly plan.

                  1.       Corporate Performance Targets

                           The corporate performance targets consist of
                           Quarterly Net Product Bookings & Reported Services
                           Revenue (Weight = 50%) and Operating Income (Weight =
                           50%). Bookings shall be defined as any new product
                           orders received during the quarter that are deemed
                           acceptable to the company by the Chief Financial
                           Officer, net of any customer booking cancellations
                           during the period. Services Revenue is as reported in
                           the Company's financial statements for the period.
                           The entry-point for the quarterly net product
                           bookings & services revenue component shall occur at
                           xx% of the quarterly target and shall be measured on
                           a non-linear basis. The entry-point for the Operating
                           Income bonus shall occur at xx% of the quarterly
                           target.

                  In the event that corporate net product bookings and services
                  revenue performance is below 100% for the quarter, the amount
                  of the quarterly net product bookings and services revenue
                  bonus pool available to each participant shall be reduced on a
                  non-linear basis by 2 percentage points for each percentage
                  point below the corporate performance target. For example,
                  corporate net product bookings and services revenue
                  performance at 80% shall result in product bookings and
                  services bonus availability of 60%. (20 percentage points x 2
                  = 40 percentage point reduction). The entry-point for the
                  Operating Income component is 100%.

B.       Annual Bonus

                  The annual bonus at 100% of the annual plan shall equate to
                  xx% of the total annualized bonus available under the plan.
                  The annual bonus shall be based solely on the net product
                  bookings and services revenue component. The entry-point for
                  annual bonus eligibility shall occur at xx% of the annual net
                  product bookings and services revenue target of $xxx. The
                  annual bonus is capped at 100% achievement. In the event that
                  the annual corporate net product bookings and services revenue
                  performance is below 100%, the amount of the annual net
                  product bookings and services revenue bonus pool available to
                  each participant shall be reduced on a non-linear basis by 2
                  percentage points for each percentage point below the
                  corporate performance target.

         relationship. Nothing in this plan creates, or is intended to create, a
         promise or representation of continued employment or employment for a
         fixed period of time. No officer, manager, supervisor or other
         representative of the Company has the authority to enter into any

         time or for employment other than employment at-will.

         being actively employed by through the date of annual earnings release.
         In the unlikely event of a participant's death following a bonus
         period, any unpaid earned bonus shall be payable to the plan
         participant's beneficiary as designated under the Concerto Software
         Life Insurance benefit.

VI.      AUTHORITY

         The President & Chief Executive Officer shall retain final authority to
         settle any disputes that may arise through the interpretation and
         application of the compensation plan. This Plan supersedes all previous
         written and/or verbal agreements, plans or arrangements between the
         employee and the company with respect to the Executive Incentive
         Compensation Program at Concerto Software.

         The Corporation reserves the sole right to change any provision of this
         compensation plan or to terminate the plan in it's entirety at any time
         with or without advance notice and without any liability for the
         disbursement of payments stipulated under this Plan.

         All rewards proposed for disbursement by the President & Chief
         Executive Officer as stipulated under this Plan are subject to approval
         by Concerto Software's Board of Directors.

         this plan shall serve to supersede all compensation plans and
         agreements previously in effect.

         Agreed:
