<U>Related  Documents</U>.  This  Promissory  Note is made  pursuant to the Loan
Agreement  and is  secured  by the real  estate  mortgages  and  other  security
instruments  therein  referred to. The terms,  conditions and definitions of the
Loan Agreement are  incorporated in this  Promissory Note by this reference.  If
any  installment  due on this  Promissory Note is not paid when due, or if there
should be an Event of Default under the Loan Agreement which is not cured within
the grace period (if any)  allowed for the cure  thereof,  the unpaid  principal
balance  hereof  together with interest  accrued  thereon,  at the option of the
holder  hereof,  immediately  become due and payable  without  notice or demand.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The real estate  mortgages  and other  security  instruments  referred to in the
preceding paragraph may also secure the payment of other obligations of Maker. A
default in the  payment of any of such other  obligations  after any  applicable
notice  and  periods  of grace or cure  shall  constitute  a default  hereunder.
Nothing  herein  shall in any way lessen or impair the rights of the holder with
respect to this Promissory Note. This Promissory Note and the other  obligations
referred  to above  shall  remain  separate  obligations  of Maker  and shall be
separately  enforceable  according  to their  respective  terms.  The holder may
institute  separate  proceedings with respect to each  simultaneously or in such
order and such times as the holder may elect.  The  pendency of any  proceedings
with respect to this  Promissory Note or other  obligation  shall not be grounds
for the abatement or for hindering,  delaying or preventing any proceedings with
respect to any other obligation.  Default under each shall constitute a separate
cause of action and the institution of proceedings  upon one, but not all, shall
not be construed as splitting a cause of action by the holder. </FONT></P>

<U>Waiver</U>.  Each endorser and any other party liable on this Promissory Note
severally  waives  demand,  presentment,  notice of dishonor  and  protest,  and
consents to any extension or  postponement  of time of its payment without limit
as to the number or period, to any  substitution,  exchange or release of all or
any part of the collateral,  to the addition of any party, and to the release or
discharge of, or suspension of any rights and remedies  against,  any person who
may be liable for the payment of this  Promissory  Note. No delay on the part of
Payee in the  exercise  of any right or remedy  shall  operate  as a waiver.  No
single or partial  exercise by Payee of any right or remedy  shall  preclude any
other  future  exercise of it or the  exercise of any other right or remedy.  No
waiver  or  indulgence  by Payee of any  default  shall be  effective  unless in
writing and signed by Payee,  nor shall a waiver on one occasion be construed as
a bar to or waiver of that right on any future occasion. </FONT></P>
