                                    (iv) Notwithstanding any provision of this
                  Agreement or any agreement referenced herein to the contrary:

                                    (A) In lieu of consummating the Loan
Exchange and the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Option Agreement as
described above, the Senior Lenders and the Original Senior Lenders may grant
such waivers, forbearances or consents under the Existing Senior Facility as
required to permit the consummation of the Notes Exchange and the Charter
Amendment; provided, however, that if the Senior Lenders and the Original Senior
Lenders grant such waivers, forbearances or consents, the Noteholders'
obligations (other than those obligations set forth in Section 9.14) under this
Agreement (including, without limitation, to exchange their Notes) shall
terminate unless and until Noteholders holding at least 90% in principal amount
of the Notes held by all Noteholders consent in writing to consummate the Notes
Exchange as set forth in this Agreement. In connection with any such waivers,
forbearances or consents, the obligations of the Company and the Senior Lenders
hereunder with respect to the Loan Exchange and the Purchase Option Agreement
shall be deemed terminated.

                                    (B) If the Senior Lenders and the Original
Senior Lenders do not grant the waivers, forbearances or consents described in
the foregoing subsection (A), the Noteholders shall have no obligations (other
than those obligations set forth in Section 9.14) under the terms of this
Agreement (including, without limitation, to exchange their Notes) unless and
until (1) the Company consummates the Loan Exchange and the transactions
contemplated by the Purchase Option Agreement, and (2) Noteholders holding 90%
in principal amount of the Notes held by all Noteholders approve in writing the
final and complete terms and conditions of the Loan Exchange and the
transactions contemplated by the Purchase Option Agreement.

                                    (C) A Noteholders' execution of this
Agreement does not constitute consent or approval for purposes of this Section
1.1(a)(iv), and nothing under any other provision of this Agreement (including,
without limitation, Section 6.12) shall require a Noteholder to vote to approve
any transaction or arrangement contemplated under this Section 1.1(a)(iv).

                           (b) Loan Exchange Closing. The closing of the Loan

                  1.2. The Notes Exchange.

                           (a) Agreement to Effect the Notes Exchange. On the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein:

                                    (i) Company Agreement to Exchange. The
                  Company hereby agrees to acquire all of the Notes held by the
                  Noteholders in exchange for the Notes Exchange Consideration
                  (as defined below).

                                    (ii) Notes Exchange Consideration. For the
                  purposes of this Agreement, the term "Notes Exchange
                  Consideration" shall mean the consideration payable by the
                  Company to each Noteholder in respect of each $1,000 in
                  principal amount of Notes exchanged in the Notes Exchange,
                  which consideration shall consist of (A) $28.75 in cash and
                  (B) 190.9560 shares of Common Stock and 9.5242 shares of
                  Series B Preferred Stock (as defined below), as ratably
                  reduced to reflect any principal amount less than $1,000 so
                  exchanged.

                                    (iii) Noteholder Agreement to Exchange;
                  Certain Waivers and Forbearances. Except as otherwise
                  expressly set forth under its name on the signature pages
                  hereto, each of the Noteholders severally and not jointly
                  agrees to exchange all of the Notes held by it for the Notes
                  Exchange Consideration. In addition to the foregoing, each of
                  the Noteholders agrees that it:

                                    (A) shall not take any action or exercise
any right that it may have under the Indenture (as defined below) to require the
Company to repurchase any Notes as the result of any Repurchase Event resulting
from a Termination of Trading (each as defined in the Indenture) or to
accelerate the Notes as a result thereof; and

                                    (B) shall not instruct or procure the
Trustee (as such term is defined in the Indenture) to take any action that is
inconsistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

                           (b) Notes Exchange Closing. The closing of the Notes
Exchange (the "Notes Exchange Closing") shall take place (i) at the offices of
Stroock & Stroock & Lavan LLP, 180 Maiden Lane, New York, New York at 10:00 A.M.
on the first business day after which the last to be fulfilled or waived of the
applicable conditions set forth in Article VII shall



                                       7
<PAGE>

be satisfied or waived in accordance with this Agreement (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Notes Exchange
Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those conditions) or (ii)
at such other place and time and/or on such other date as the Company and the
Noteholders may agree in writing. The date on which the Notes Exchange Closing
occurs is referred to as the "Notes Exchange Closing Date". To the extent
reasonably practicable and assuming that the waivers, forbearances or consents
referred to in Section 1.1(a)(iv) have not theretofore been granted, the parties
shall cooperate and use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Notes
Exchange Closing to occur on the same day as the Loan Exchange Closing. The
Company further agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
closing of the exchange of Notes contemplated by the LC Capital Side Letter to
occur simultaneously with the Notes Exchange Closing.

                           (c) Closing Deliveries.

                                    (i) Company Deliveries. In connection with
                  and at the Notes Exchange Closing, the Company shall deliver
                  to each Noteholder the following items:

                                    (A) the certificates representing the shares
of Capital Stock (as defined below) included in the Notes Exchange Consideration
to be received by such Noteholder, duly executed;

                                    (B) the cash included in the Notes Exchange
Consideration to be received by such Noteholder, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account specified by such Noteholder in writing delivered
to the Company at least two business days prior to the Notes Exchange Closing
Date;

                                    (C) a copy of the legal opinions of
Robinson, Bradshaw & Hinson, P.A. and of the general counsel of the Company as
to the Notes Exchange and the shares of Capital Stock issued in connection
therewith, dated as of the Notes Exchange Closing Date, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Noteholders, duly executed;

                                    (D) the Registration Rights Agreement (as
defined below), duly executed; and

                                    (E) such other written instruments or
accompanying documentation as may be reasonably necessary or appropriate in
order to document the satisfaction or waiver of the applicable closing
conditions set forth in Section 7.4 and as reasonably requested by the
Noteholders.

                                    (ii) Noteholder Deliveries. In connection
                  with and at the Notes Exchange Closing, each Noteholder shall
                  deliver to the Company the following items:

                                    (A) its Notes, indirectly through an agent,
custodian or similar arrangement in book-entry form (e.g., by letter of free
transfer) in exchange for the Notes Exchange Consideration, together with such
other written instruments or accompanying



                                       8
<PAGE>

documentation as may be reasonably necessary or appropriate to transfer and
cancel such Notes; and

                                    (B) such other written instruments or
accompanying documentation as may be reasonably necessary or appropriate in
order to satisfy or obtain a waiver of the applicable closing conditions set
forth in Section 1.2(a)(ii) and as reasonably requested by the Company.

                  1.3. The Charter Amendment.

                           (a) Adoption. Subject to obtaining the Charter
Amendment Requisite Vote, and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the
applicable conditions in Section 7.1, the Company shall take all steps necessary
and appropriate to effect the Charter Amendment. The Company further
acknowledges and agrees that pending the Charter Amendment Requisite Vote, the
Company will comply with the provisions of Article Twelfth of the Charter
Amendment and all other provisions relating thereto.

                           (b) Filing and Effective Time. The Company shall file
the Charter Amendment with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware as
promptly as practicable after the Company obtains the Charter Amendment
Requisite Vote. The Charter Amendment shall become effective upon such filing
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, in such form as required
by, and executed in accordance with, the relevant provisions of the Delaware
General Corporation Law ("DGCL") (such effective time, the "Charter Amendment
Effective Time").

                           (c) The Reverse Split Ratio. In connection with and
as part of the Charter Amendment, the Company agrees to take all actions
necessary and appropriate to cause each outstanding share of Common Stock to be
split into, and without any further action on the part of the holder thereof, to
become and thereafter represent .0400 shares (the "Reverse Split") of Common
Stock, subject to adjustment as set forth in this paragraph (c), with effect as
of the Charter Amendment Effective Time. The parties acknowledge and agree that
the foregoing ratio was calculated on the assumption of 26,931,212 shares (the
"Assumed Share Amount") of Common Stock outstanding and underlying any
Below-Threshold Options (as defined below), which number has been derived from
the representations of the Company. If the actual aggregate number of shares of
Common Stock outstanding and underlying any Below-Threshold Options that
theretofore have not been canceled pursuant to Section 6.8 exceeds the Assumed
Share Amount by more than 150,000 shares (calculated on a pre-reverse split
basis two business days prior to the Notes Exchange Closing), the Company shall
proportionately increase the number of shares of Capital Stock to be issued as
Notes Exchange Consideration pursuant to Section 1.2(a)(iii) and the number of
shares of Common Stock underlying the New Equity Plan and the Series A Warrants
to be issued in the Loan Exchange and shall provide such reasonable written
support therefor at the Notes Exchange Closing.

the By-Laws and their respective Employment Agreements, each as amended from
time to time, and applicable law.

                  2.4. The Rights Plan. The parties shall contemporaneously with
the Notes Exchange Closing and subject to completion of the Notes Exchange
present to the New Board either an amendment and restatement of the Rights Plan
or a new rights agreement (as described below, and as so amended and restated or
newly adopted, as the case may be, the "New Rights Plan").

                           (a) The Company shall take all action necessary to
adopt and effect the New Rights Plan (including, if applicable, terminating the
Rights Plan), as approved by the New Board subject to fiduciary duties and
applicable law. The New Rights Plan shall be in a form provided by counsel to
the Noteholders prior to the Notes Exchange Closing and shall have customary
terms and conditions and such other provisions as may reasonably be agreed prior
to the Notes Exchange Closing by the Company and the Noteholders; provided that
the New Rights Plan shall in any event exempt from triggering the Rights, (a)
the beneficial ownership by the Noteholders of Capital Stock acquired in the
Transactions, (b) the beneficial ownership by any Significant Holder (as defined
in Exhibit A attached hereto) of Capital Stock acquired in accordance with the
Charter and (c) the beneficial ownership by any third party of Capital Stock
acquired in a transfer from a Significant Holder.

                           (b) The New Rights Plan shall also contain provisions
requiring that all Five Percent Holders (as defined in Exhibit A hereto),
including each qualifying member of a group constituting a Five Percent Holder,
be given the opportunity to participate pro rata, for the same amount and form
of consideration and otherwise on substantially the same terms and conditions
("Tag-Along Right"), in any proposed direct or indirect transfer to a third
party, whether in one or a series of related transactions, by any Significant
Holder(s) (or any Controlled or Controlling Affiliates (as defined in Exhibit A
hereto) of a Significant Holder or one or more Significant Holders acting in
concert), of Capital Stock representing an aggregate of 20% or more of the
voting stock of the Corporation, and the final form of such provisions of the
New Rights Plan shall be reasonably acceptable to each of the Noteholders.
Unless the Tag-Along Right is provided for in a separate written agreement
reasonably satisfactory to any and each Five Percent Holder, any amendment or
repeal of the provisions of the New Rights Plan regarding such Tag-Along Right
shall require the approval of any and each Five Percent Holder; provided,
however, that the foregoing limitation shall not apply to any amendment or
repeal of such provisions in connection with any merger, consolidation or
similar transaction with an entity that is not a Significant Holder or
Controlled or Controlling Affiliate thereof or a subsidiary of the Company and
that has the result of causing the stockholders of the Company immediately prior
to such transaction to beneficially own less than fifty percent (50%) of the
voting power of the shares entitled to vote generally in elections of directors
of the Company or the corporation surviving or resulting from such transaction
and less than fifty percent (50%) of the outstanding shares of Common Stock or
common stock of the corporation surviving or resulting from such transaction.
Five Percent Holders shall not be required to make representations and
warranties in connection with the exercise of their Tag-Along Right, other than
customary representations and warranties with respect to due organization, power
and authority, ownership of the shares of Capital Stock and ability to freely
convey such shares without liens and encumbrances, noncontravention of
organizational documents and material



                                       11

agreements, accredited investor and other related status, and enforceability of
obligations under the applicable transfer documents.

                           (c) The Company agrees to take all actions necessary
to approve, for purposes of Section 203 of the DGCL and any other Takeover
Statute (as defined below), any transfer of Capital Stock by a Significant
Holder in accordance with the terms of the New Rights Plan.

                                  ARTICLE III

           Effects on Capitalization; Exchange Mechanics; Adjustments

                  3.1. Certain Effects of Transactions on Capitalization. As a
result of the applicable Transaction and without any action on the part of the
holder of any Capital Stock:

                           (a) Certain Effects of Charter Amendment. Each share
of the Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Charter
Amendment Effective Time (including any shares of Common Stock owned by the
Company or any other direct or indirect Subsidiary (as defined below) of the
Company) shall be reverse split as provided pursuant to the Reverse Split and
shall, as so adjusted, otherwise remain outstanding and be entitled to the same
dividend and other relative rights, preferences, limitations and restrictions as
are provided by the Charter. At the Charter Amendment Effective Time, each
certificate formerly representing any of such shares prior to giving effect to
the Charter Amendment shall thereafter represent the number of shares after
giving effect to the Reverse Split and the right, if any, to receive cash in
lieu of fractional shares represented by such certificate for shares of Common
Stock pursuant to Section 3.4.

                           (b) Certain Effects of Notes Exchange. At and after
the Notes Exchange Closing, all Notes exchanged in the Notes Exchange shall no
longer be outstanding and shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease to
exist and shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Notes
Exchange Consideration and the right, if any, to receive any distribution or
dividend pursuant to Section 3.3.

                           (c) Preferred Stock. Each share of Preferred Stock
(as defined below) issued and outstanding at the Notes Exchange Closing, and
each share of Preferred Stock issued and outstanding at the Charter Amendment
Effective Time, shall remain outstanding and shall be entitled to the same
dividend and other relative rights, preferences, limitations and restrictions as
are provided by the Charter (including the respective certificates of
designation in respect of such Preferred Stock).

                  3.2. Depositary; Exchange Mechanics.

                           (a) Depositary. Promptly following the date hereof,
the Company shall, with the Noteholders' prior approval, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, select a depositary (the "Depositary"), which Depositary
will establish an account for the benefit of the Company to which Noteholders
shall transfer all of the Notes to be exchanged pursuant to the Notes Exchange
(the "Exchange Account").



                                       12
<PAGE>

                           (b) Letter of Free Transfer. In connection with the
Notes Exchange, the Company shall, as soon as practicable following the date
hereof, collect one or more letters of transfer from each of the Noteholders, in
customary form and with such other provisions to be reasonably agreed upon by
the Company and the Noteholders (a "Letter of Free Transfer"), together with
appropriate related instructions, specifying the mechanics for transfer of the
Notes held by them to the Exchange Account immediately prior to the Notes
Exchange Closing.

                           (c) Termination of Exchange Account. Any Notes that
have been delivered to the Depositary in connection with the Notes Exchange
shall be returned without charge to the holder thereof in the event that the
Notes Exchange Closing does not occur within five business days of transfer to
the Exchange Account, upon written notice of the applicable Noteholder. In the
event that this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms or the
Notes Exchange is abandoned hereunder and any Notes have been transmitted to the
Depositary, such Notes shall promptly be returned without charge to the Person
submitting the same. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term "Person" shall
mean any individual, corporation (including not-for-profit), general or limited
partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, estate, trust,
association, organization, Governmental Entity (as defined below) or other
entity of any kind or nature.

                           (d) No Accrued Interest. In addition, each Person
exchanging Notes in the Notes Exchange shall be required in the appropriate
Letter of Free Transfer to waive, among other things, any interest owing on the
Notes exchanged in the Notes Exchange in respect of any period after a

                           (e) Computations. The Company, in consultation with
the Noteholders and based on information received from the Depositary, shall
make all computations to give effect to this Article III.

                  3.3. Distribution on Exchanged Notes. All shares of Capital
Stock to be issued pursuant to the Notes Exchange shall be deemed issued and
outstanding as of the Notes Exchange Closing Date. Whenever a dividend or other
distribution is declared by the Company in respect of the Capital Stock, the
record date for which is on or after the Notes Exchange Closing Date, that
declaration shall include dividends or other distributions in respect of all
shares of Capital Stock issuable pursuant to this Agreement. No such dividends
or other distributions shall be paid to any Noteholder until the Notes of such
Noteholder are exchanged pursuant to the Notes Exchange and in accordance with
this Article III.

                  3.4. Fractional Shares. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, no fractional shares of Capital Stock or right to purchase
fractional shares will be issued in any/ of the Transactions. Any Person
entitled to receive a fractional share (or right to purchase a fractional share)
in any of the Transactions instead shall be entitled to receive: (a) in the case
of any fractional shares of Common Stock resulting from the Reverse Split in the
Charter Amendment, a cash payment equal to the fair value thereof, based on the
product of the fractional amount of such share multiplied by the average per
share final bid price of the Common Stock on the OTC Bulletin Board for the 20
trading days ending on the fifth trading



                                       13

as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Company; and (b) in
the case of any fractional shares of Capital Stock otherwise to be issued in the
Notes Exchange or underlying the Series A Warrants to be issued in the Loan
Exchange, such fractional interest shall be rounded down or up, as the case may
be, to the nearest whole share.

                  3.5. Dissenters' Rights. In accordance with Section 262 of the
DGCL, no appraisal rights shall be available to holders of shares of Common
Stock in connection with the Transactions.

                  3.6. Adjustments to Prevent Dilution. In the event that prior
to any of the Transactions, other than as a result of the Transactions the
Company changes the number of shares of Capital Stock or securities convertible
or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of Capital Stock issued and
outstanding or otherwise subject to issuance as a result of a reclassification,
stock split (including a reverse split but excluding the Reverse Split), stock
dividend or distribution, recapitalization, merger, consolidation, subdivision,
issuer tender or exchange offer, or any other similar transaction, the Series A
Warrants, the Capital Stock issuable in the Notes Exchange and the New Equity
Plan (as defined below) shall be equitably adjusted.

                  3.7. Treatment of the Unexchanged Notes; Interest Payments
Under the Indenture. After the Notes Exchange Closing, the parties acknowledge
and agree that the Indenture, dated June 23, 1997, pursuant to which the Company
issued the Notes (the "Indenture") and the Notes not exchanged in the Note
Exchange shall continue to remain outstanding and in force and effect. The
Company agrees with the Noteholders that it shall on and after the date hereof
and up to and through the Notes Exchange Closing Date timely make any interest
payments as and when due under the Indenture.

consummate the Transactions or any other transactions contemplated hereby;
provided, that the foregoing representation shall not apply to any party that is
an individual.



                                       14

and to general equity principles.

                           (c) No Organic or Legal Violations. The execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement by it do not, and the consummation by
it of any applicable Transactions and the other transactions contemplated hereby
will not, constitute or result in (i) a breach or violation of, or a default

instruments or (ii) a breach or violation of, or a default under, the
acceleration of any obligations or the creation of a Lien (as defined below) on
the assets of it (with or without notice, lapse of time or both) pursuant to any
federal, state, local or foreign law, statute, ordinance, rule, regulation,
judgment, order, injunction, decree, arbitration award, agency requirement or
similar restriction (collectively, "Laws") of any court or any foreign or
domestic governmental, regulatory or self-regulatory authority, agency,
commission, body or other entity (each, a "Governmental Entity") to which it is
subject, except, in the case of clause (ii) above, for any breach, violation,
default, acceleration or creation of a Lien that, individually or in the
aggregate, is not reasonably likely to prevent, materially delay or materially
impair the ability of it to consummate any applicable Transactions or the other
transactions contemplated hereby; provided, that the representation with respect
to clause (i) above shall not apply to any party that is an individual.

                  4.2. Representations and Warranties of the Group. Except as
set forth in the corresponding sections or subsections of the disclosure letter
delivered to the Holders by the Company on or prior to entering into this
Agreement (the "Disclosure Letter"), the Group hereby jointly and severally
represents and warrants to each of the Holders that:

                           (a) Organizational Documents. The Company has made
available to the Holders a complete and correct copy of each member of the
Group's certificate of incorporation and by-laws or similar organizational
documents, each as amended to date, and each as so delivered are in full force
and effect.

                           (b) Capital Structure. The authorized capital stock
of the Company consists of 95,000,000 shares of Common Stock and 5,000,000
shares of preferred stock, $0.01 par value per share (the "Preferred Stock" and,
together with the Common Stock, the "Capital Stock"), of which 500,000 shares
are designated as Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, par value $0.01
per share (the "Series A Preferred"). As of the close of business on December
31, 2002 there were outstanding 26,881,212 shares of Common Stock and no shares

                                       15
<PAGE>

reserved for issuance, except that, as of the close of business on December 31,
2002, there were 2,837,135 shares of Common Stock reserved for issuance pursuant
to the Company's 1995 Equity Participation Plan (the "Stock Plan"), 500,000
shares of Series A Preferred reserved for issuance pursuant to the Company's
Rights Agreement, dated as of February 6, 1996, as amended, between the Company
and Wachovia Bank, National Association (formerly known as First Union National
Bank), as Rights Agent (the "Rights Plan"), and a certain number of shares of
Common Stock subject to issuance pursuant to the Notes. Each of the outstanding
shares of capital stock or other securities of each of the Company's
Subsidiaries is duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
and owned by the Company or by a direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of
the Company, free and clear of Liens. Except as set forth above, there are no
preemptive or other outstanding rights, options, warrants, conversion rights,
stock appreciation rights, redemption rights, repurchase rights, agreements,
arrangements or commitments to issue or sell any shares of capital stock or
other securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any securities or
obligations convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for, or giving any
Person a right to subscribe for or acquire, any securities of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, and no securities or obligations evidencing such rights are
authorized, issued or outstanding. The Company does not have outstanding any
bonds, debentures, notes or other obligations the holders of which have the
right to vote (or, other than the Notes, convertible into or exercisable for
securities having the right to vote) with the stockholders of the Company on any
matter ("Voting Debt"). As used in this Agreement, the term "Subsidiary" means,
with respect to any party, any entity, whether incorporated or unincorporated,
of which at least a majority of the securities or ownership interests having by
their terms ordinary voting power to elect a majority of the Board of Directors
or other persons performing similar functions is directly or indirectly owned or
controlled by such party or by one or more of its respective Subsidiaries or by
such party and any one or more of its respective Subsidiaries.

         Section 4.2(b) of the Disclosure Letter contains a correct and complete
list of each outstanding option, warrant or similar right (including any stock
appreciation rights) to purchase or acquire any shares of Common Stock under the
Stock Plan (each, an "Option") including the holder, date of grant, exercise
price and number of shares subject thereto and identifying in the Supplement to
Annex A to the Disclosure Letter each such Option that is not subject to an
irrevocable and legally binding agreement to cancel in connection with the Notes
Exchange and that also has an exercise price of less than either $2.21 per share
or that would have an exercise price of less than $55.25 per share pro forma
after giving effect to the Charter Amendment (such Options so identified with an
asterisk referred to herein as "Below-Threshold Options"). The Company agrees
that it shall promptly and in any event prior to the tenth business day before
the Notes Exchange Closing Date deliver to the Noteholders updates to the
Disclosure Letters identifying any changes in Section 4.2(b) thereof that result
from canceling or otherwise obtaining irrevocable and legally binding agreements
to cancel Options in connection with the Notes Exchange.

                           (c) Required Stockholder Votes; Issuance of Capital
Stock; Board Approval.

                                    (i) The only approvals of stockholders of
                  the Company required for the Company to execute, deliver and
                  perform its obligations under



                                       16
<PAGE>

                  this Agreement and to consummate each of the Transactions are
                  the Stockholder Votes (as defined below).

                                    (ii) Prior to the Notes Exchange Closing,
                  the Company will have taken all action necessary to permit it
                  to issue the Capital Stock required to be issued as Notes
                  Exchange Consideration. The Capital Stock, when issued in the
                  Notes Exchange, will be validly issued, fully paid and
                  nonassessable, and no stockholder of the Company will have any
                  preemptive right of subscription or purchase in respect
                  thereof.

                                    (iii) The Board of Directors of the Company
                  and of each other member of the Group has (subject to
                  abstention by certain directors who are entering into
                  Employment Agreements with respect to such agreements)
                  unanimously approved this Agreement and each of the
                  Transactions and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

                           (d) Governmental Filings; No Registration. Other than
the filings and/or notices (i) pursuant to Section 1.3 (The Charter Amendment),
(ii) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act") and the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), (iii) to
comply with state securities or "blue-sky" laws, (iv) required to be made with
the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") and the National Association of
Securities Dealers and (v) with the Bankruptcy Court (as defined below) in
connection with the Back-Up Plan, no notices, reports or other filings are
required to be made by any of the Group with, nor are any consents,
registrations, approvals, permits or authorizations required to be obtained by
it from, any court or Governmental Entity in connection with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement by it and the consummation by it of the Transactions
and the other transactions contemplated hereby, except those that the failure to
make or obtain are not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to
prevent, materially delay or materially impair the ability of it to consummate
the Transactions and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

                           (e) Securities Act Exemption. Assuming the accuracy
of the Holders' representations in Section 4.3(b) and 4.3(c), it is not, and
will not be, necessary in connection with the offer, sale or delivery of the
Capital Stock in the Notes Exchange or of the Series A Warrants (without regard
to the Common Stock issuable thereunder) and the New Junior Secured Notes in the
Loan Exchange to register under the Securities Act the offer and sale of such
Capital Stock or Series A Warrants or New Junior Secured Notes.

                           (f) No Contract Violations. The execution, delivery
and performance of this Agreement by the Group do not, and the consummation by
the Group of the Transactions and the other transactions contemplated hereby
(other than pursuant to the Back-Up Plan) will not, constitute or result in a
breach or violation of, or a default under, the acceleration of any obligations
of, or the creation of any Lien on the assets of, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (with or without notice, lapse of time or both) pursuant to, any
agreement, lease, contract, note, mortgage, indenture, arrangement or other
obligation not otherwise terminable by either party thereto on 90 days' or less
notice ("Contracts") and binding upon the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
any change in the rights or obligations of any party under any of the



                                       17
<PAGE>

Contracts, except for any breach, violation, default, acceleration, creation or
change that, individually or in the aggregate, is not reasonably likely to have
a Material Adverse Effect or to prevent, materially delay or materially impair
the ability of the Group to consummate the Transactions and the other
transactions contemplated hereby. As used in this Agreement, the term "Material
Adverse Effect" means a material adverse effect on the financial condition,
properties, prospects, business or results of operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole; provided, however, that any such effect resulting
from any change (i) in law, rule, or regulation or generally accepted accounting
principles ("GAAP") or interpretations thereof that applies to the Group and
similar entities on substantially the same basis or (ii) in the staffing
industry specifically, or economic or business conditions generally, shall not
be considered when determining if a Material Adverse Effect has occurred.

                           (g) Company Reports; Financial Statements. The
Company has delivered to the Holders each registration statement, report, proxy
statement or information statement prepared by it since December 30, 2001 (the
"Audit Date"), including (i) the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
year ended December 30, 2001 and (ii) the Company's Quarterly Reports on Form
10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2002, June 30, 2002 and September 29, 2002,
each in the form (including exhibits, annexes and any amendments thereto) filed
with the SEC (collectively, including any such reports filed subsequent to the
date hereof, the "Company Reports"). As of their respective dates, the Company
Reports did not, and any Company Reports filed with the SEC subsequent to the
date hereof will not, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements made therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made,
not misleading. Each of the consolidated balance sheets included in or
incorporated by reference into the Company Reports (including the related notes
and schedules) fairly presents, or will fairly present, the consolidated
financial position of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of its date and each
of the consolidated statements of income and of changes in financial position
included in or incorporated by reference into the Company Reports (including any
related notes and schedules) fairly presents, or will fairly present, the
results of operations, retained earnings and changes in financial position, as
the case may be, of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the periods set forth
therein (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to notes and normal
year-end audit adjustments that will not be material in amount or effect), in
each case in accordance with GAAP consistently applied during the periods
involved, except as may be noted therein.

                           (h) Absence of Certain Changes. Except as disclosed
in the Company Reports filed prior to the date hereof and the Report of the
Company on Form 8-K filed November 12, 2002, since the Audit Date the Company
and its Subsidiaries have conducted their respective businesses only in, and
have not engaged in any material transaction other than according to, the
ordinary and usual course of such businesses and there has not been (i) any
change in the financial condition, properties, prospects, business or results of
operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries or any development or combination
of developments of which the executive officers of the Company have knowledge
that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or is reasonably likely to have
a Material Adverse Effect; (ii) any material damage, destruction or other
casualty loss with respect to any material asset or property owned, leased or
otherwise used by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not covered
by insurance; (iii) any declaration, setting aside or payment of any dividend or
other distribution in respect of the



                                       18
<PAGE>

capital stock of the Company, except for dividends or other distributions on its
capital stock publicly announced prior to the date hereof; or (iv) any change by
the Company in accounting principles, practices or methods. Since the Audit
Date, except as provided for herein or as disclosed in the Company Reports filed
prior to the date hereof, there has not been any increase in the compensation
payable or that could become payable by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
to officers or key employees or any amendment of any of the Compensation and
Benefit Plans (as defined below) other than increases or amendments in the
ordinary course.

                           (i) Litigation and Liabilities. Except as disclosed
in the Company Reports filed prior to the date hereof, there are no (i) civil,
criminal or administrative actions, suits, claims, hearings, investigations or
proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of the executive officers of the
Company, threatened against the Company or any of its affiliates or (ii)
obligations or liabilities, whether or not accrued, contingent or otherwise and
whether or not required to be disclosed, including those relating to
environmental and occupational safety and health matters, or any other facts or
circumstances of which the executive officers of the Company have knowledge that
could result in any claims against, or obligations or liabilities of, the
Company or any of its affiliates, except for those that are not, individually or
in the aggregate, reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect or to
prevent or to materially impair the ability of the Group to consummate the
Transactions or the other transactions contemplated hereby.

                           (j) Employee Benefits.

                                    (i) A copy of each bonus, deferred
                  compensation, pension, retirement, profit-sharing, thrift,
                  savings, employee stock ownership, stock bonus, stock
                  purchase, restricted stock, stock option (including the Stock
                  Plan), employment, termination, severance, compensation,
                  medical, health, life, disability or other plan, agreement,
                  policy or arrangement that covers employees, directors, former
                  employees or former directors of the Company and its
                  Subsidiaries (the "Compensation and Benefit Plans") and any
                  trust agreement or insurance contract forming a part of such
                  Compensation and Benefit Plans has been made available to the
                  Noteholders prior to the date hereof. The Company has taken
                  all action required to terminate the Company's 2001
                  Non-Qualified Employee Stock Purchase Plan.

                                    (ii) The Compensation and Benefit Plans are
                  listed in Section 4.2 (j) of the Disclosure Letter and any
                  "change of control" or similar provisions therein are
                  specifically identified in Section 4.2 (j) of the Disclosure
                  Letter.

                                    (iii) All Compensation and Benefit Plans are
                  in compliance in all material respects (both in their terms
                  and in their operation) with all applicable laws, including
                  the Code and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
                  1974, as amended ("ERISA"). Each Compensation and Benefit Plan
                  that is an "employee pension benefit plan" within the meaning
                  of Section 3(2) of ERISA (a "Pension Plan") and that is
                  intended to be qualified under Section 401 (a) of the Code has
                  received a favorable determination letter from the Internal
                  Revenue Service (the "IRS"), and the Company is not aware of
                  any circumstances likely to



                                       19
<PAGE>

                  result in revocation of any such favorable determination
                  letter. There is no pending or, to the knowledge of the
                  executive officers of the Company, threatened claim, action,
                  investigation, proceeding or lawsuit relating to the
                  Compensation and Benefit Plans (other than any claim for
                  benefits in the ordinary course). Neither the Company nor any
                  of its Subsidiaries has engaged in a transaction with respect
                  to any Compensation and Benefit Plan that, assuming the
                  taxable period of such transaction expired as of the date
                  hereof, would subject the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
                  to a tax or penalty imposed by either Section 4975 of the Code
                  or Section 502 of ERISA.

                                    (iv) As of the date hereof, no liability
                  under Subtitle C or D of Title IV of ERISA has been or is
                  expected to be incurred by the Company or any Subsidiary with
                  respect to any ongoing, frozen or terminated "single-employer
                  plan", within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA,
                  currently or formerly maintained by any of them, or the
                  single-employer plan of any entity which is considered one
                  employer with the Company under Section 4001 of ERISA or
                  Section 414 of the Code (an "ERISA Affiliate"). The Company
                  and its Subsidiaries either (A) have not incurred and do not
                  expect to incur any withdrawal liability with respect to a
                  multiemployer plan under Subtitle E to Title IV of ERISA or
                  (B) have not contributed, or been obligated to contribute, to
                  a multiemployer plan under Subtitle E of Title IV of ERISA at
                  any time since September 26, 1980. No notice of a "reportable
                  event", within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA for which
                  the 30-day reporting requirement has not been waived, has been
                  required to be filed for any Pension Plan or by any ERISA
                  Affiliate within the 12-month period ending on the date hereof
                  or will be required to be filed in connection with the
                  Transactions and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

                                    (v) All contributions required to be made
                  under the terms of any Compensation and Benefit Plan as of the
                  date hereof have been timely made and any other liabilities of
                  the Company and its Subsidiaries have been reflected on the
                  most recent consolidated balance sheet filed or incorporated
                  by reference in the Company Reports prior to the date hereof.
                  Neither any Pension Plan nor any single-employer plan of an
                  ERISA Affiliate has an "accumulated funding deficiency"
                  (whether or not waived) within the meaning of Section 412 of
                  the Code or Section 302 of ERISA and neither the Company, its
                  Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate has failed to make when
                  due all quarterly contributions required under Section 412 of
                  the Code or Section 302 of ERISA. Neither the Company nor its
                  Subsidiaries has provided, or is required to provide, security
                  to any Pension Plan or to any single-employer plan of an ERISA
                  Affiliate pursuant to Section 401(a)(29) of the Code.

                                    (vi) Under each Pension Plan which is a
                  single-employer plan, as of the last day of the most recent
                  plan year ended prior to the date hereof, the actuarially
                  determined present value of all "benefit liabilities", within
                  the meaning of Section 4001(a)(16) of ERISA (as determined on
                  the basis of the actuarial assumptions contained in the
                  Pension Plan's most recent actuarial valuation), did



                                       20
<PAGE>

                  not exceed the then current value of the assets of such
                  Pension Plan, and there has been no material change in the
                  financial condition of such Pension Plan since the last day of
                  the most recent plan year.

                                    (vii) Neither the Company nor its
                  Subsidiaries have any obligations for post-termination health,
                  life or other non-pension benefits under any Compensation and
                  Benefit Plan, except as set forth in Section 4.2(j) of the
                  Company Disclosure Letter or as required pursuant to Section
                  4980B of the Code and Sections 601 through 608 of ERISA. The
                  Company or its Subsidiaries may amend or terminate any such
                  plan under the terms of such plan at any time without
                  incurring any material liability thereunder with respect to
                  events subsequent to such termination.

                                    (viii) The consummation of the Transactions
                  and the other transactions contemplated hereby will not (x)
                  entitle any employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries to
                  severance pay, (y) accelerate the time of payment or vesting
                  or trigger any payment of compensation or benefits under,
                  increase the amount payable or trigger any other obligation
                  pursuant to, any of the Compensation and Benefit Plans or (z)
                  result in any breach or violation of, or a default under, any
                  of the Compensation and Benefit Plans.

                                    (ix) No event has occurred in connection
                  with which the Company, any Subsidiary, any ERISA Affiliate or
                  any Compensation and Benefit Plan, directly or indirectly
                  could be subject to any liability (a) under any statute,
                  regulation, or governmental order relating to any Compensation
                  and Benefit Plan or and single employer plan of an ERISA
                  Affiliate or (b) pursuant to any obligation of the Company or
                  a Subsidiary to indemnify a person against liability incurred
                  under any such statute, regulation or order as they relate to
                  the Compensation and Benefit Plans.

                                    (x) All Compensation and Benefit Plans
                  covering current or former non-U.S. employees or former
                  employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries comply in all
                  material respects with applicable local law. The Company and
                  its Subsidiaries have no unfunded liabilities with respect to
                  any Pension Plan or other Plan that covers such non-U.S.
                  employees.

                           (k) Compliance with Laws; Permits. Except as set
forth in the Company Reports filed prior to the date hereof, the businesses of
each of the Company and its Subsidiaries have not been, and are not being,
conducted in violation of any Laws, except for violations or possible violations
that, individually or in the aggregate, are not reasonably likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect or to prevent or materially impair the ability of the
Group to consummate the Transactions and the other transactions contemplated
hereby. Except as set forth in the Company Reports filed prior to the date
hereof, no investigation or review by any Governmental Entity with respect to
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is pending or, to the knowledge of the
executive officers of the Company, threatened, nor has any Governmental Entity
indicated an intention to conduct the same, except for those the outcome of
which are not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect or to



                                       21
<PAGE>

prevent or materially impair the ability of the Group to consummate the
Transactions and the other transactions contemplated hereby. To the knowledge of
the executive officers of the Company, no material change is required in the
Company's or any of its Subsidiaries' processes, properties or procedures in
connection with any such Laws, and the Company has not received any notice or
communication of any material noncompliance with any such Laws that has not been
cured as of the date hereof. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries have all
permits, licenses, trademarks, patents, trade names, copyrights, service marks,
franchises, variances, exemptions, orders and other governmental authorizations,
consents and approvals necessary to conduct its business as presently conducted
except those the absence of which are not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect or to prevent or materially
impair the ability of the Group to consummate the Transactions and the other
transactions contemplated hereby.

                           (l) Takeover Statutes. No "fair price," "moratorium,"
"control share acquisition" or other similar anti-takeover statute or regulation
(including Sections 55-9 and 55-9A of the North Carolina Business Corporation
Act (the "NCBCA") and Section 203 of the DGCL (each, a "Takeover Statute")) or
any anti-takeover provision in the Charter or By-Laws is, or at either of the
Notes Exchange Closing or the Loan Exchange Closing will be, applicable to, the
Loan Exchange Consideration, the Notes Exchange Consideration, the Transactions
or the other transactions contemplated hereby. Assuming the accuracy of the
Holders' representations and warranties contained in Section 4.3(a), the Board
of Directors of the Company has taken all action so that the Holders will not be
prohibited from entering into a "business combination" with the Company as an
"interested stockholder" (in each case as such term is used in Section 203 of
the DGCL) as a result of the execution of this Agreement or the consummation of
the Transactions or other transactions contemplated hereby. The Company
acknowledges and agrees that the provisions of Sections 55-9 and 55-9A of the
NCBCA or any other Takeover Statute under the NCBCA are now, and as of the Notes
Exchange Closing and the Loan Exchange Closing shall continue to be,
inapplicable to the Company.

                           (m) Tax Matters. As of the date hereof, neither the
Company nor any of its affiliates has taken or agreed to take any action, nor do
the executive officers of the Company have any knowledge of any fact or
circumstance, that would prevent the exchange of the Notes for Capital Stock in
the Notes Exchange from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a)(1)(E) of the Code.

                           (n) Taxes. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries
(i) have prepared in good faith and duly and timely filed (taking into account
any extension of time within which to file) all Tax Returns (as defined below)
required to be filed by any of them and all such filed Tax Returns are complete
and accurate in all material respects; (ii) have paid all Taxes (as defined
below) that are shown as due on such filed Tax Returns or that the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries are obligated to withhold from amounts owing to any
employee, creditor or third party, except with respect to matters contested in
good faith; and (iii) have not waived any statute of limitations with respect to
Taxes or agreed to any extension of time with respect to a Tax assessment or
deficiency. As of the date hereof, there are not pending or, to the knowledge of
the executive officers of the Company threatened in writing, any audits,
examinations, investigations or other proceedings in respect of Taxes or Tax
matters. There are not, to the knowledge of the executive officers of the
Company, any unresolved questions or



                                       22
<PAGE>

claims concerning the Company's or any of its Subsidiaries' Tax liability that
are reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect. The Company has made
available to the Holders true and correct copies of the United States federal
income Tax Returns filed by the Company and its Subsidiaries for each of the
fiscal years ended January 2, 2000, December 30, 2000 and December 30, 2001.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability with respect
to income, franchise or similar Taxes that accrued on or before the Audit Date
in excess of the amounts accrued with respect thereto that are reflected in the
financial statements included in the Company Reports filed on or prior to the
date hereof. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability
with respect to income, franchise or similar Taxes that accrued on or before the
date of the consummation of the Transactions and other transactions contemplated
hereby in excess of the amounts accrued with respect thereto that are reflected
in the books and records of the Company and its subsidiaries as of such date.

                  As used in this Agreement, (i) the term "Tax" (including, with
correlative meaning, the terms "Taxes" and "Taxable") includes all federal,
state, local and foreign income, profits, franchise, gross receipts,
environmental, customs duty, capital stock, severances, stamp, payroll, sales,
employment, unemployment, disability, use, property, withholding, excise,
production, value added, occupancy and other taxes, duties or assessments of any
nature whatsoever, together with all interest, penalties and additions imposed
with respect to such amounts and any interest in respect of such penalties and
additions, and (ii) the term "Tax Return" includes all returns and reports
(including elections, declarations, disclosures, schedules, estimates and
information returns) required to be supplied to a Tax authority relating to
Taxes.

                           (o) Labor Matters. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to or otherwise bound by any collective bargaining
agreement, contract or other agreement or understanding with a labor union or
labor organization, nor, as of the date hereof, is the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries the subject of any material proceeding asserting that the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries has committed an unfair labor practice or seeking to
compel it to bargain with any labor union or labor organization. There is not
pending or, to the knowledge of the executive officers of the Company,
threatened, nor has there been for the past five years, any labor strike,
dispute, walk-out, work stoppage, slow-down or lockout involving the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries.

                           (p) Insurance. All material fire and casualty,
general liability, business interruption, product liability, and sprinkler and
water damage insurance policies maintained by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries are with reputable insurance carriers, provide full and adequate
coverage for all normal risks incident to the business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and their respective properties and assets, except for any such
failures to maintain insurance policies that, individually or in the aggregate,
are not reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.

                           (q) Rights Plan. The Company has amended the Rights
Plan to provide that none of the Noteholders and their affiliates shall be
deemed to become an Acquiring Person (as defined in the Rights Plan) as a result
of the execution of this Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions and
has taken any other action necessary to ensure the Rights (as defined in the
Rights Plan) shall not be triggered by the execution of this Agreement or the
consummation the Transactions and the other transactions contemplated hereby.



                                       23

                           (r) Brokers and Finders. Neither any of the Group nor
any of its officers, directors or employees has employed any broker or finder or
incurred any liability for any brokerage fees, commissions or finders' fees in
connection with the Transactions or the other transactions contemplated hereby
(or any Alternative Proposal (as defined below)) except that the Company has
employed UBS Warburg LLC ("UBS") as its financial advisor, the arrangements with
which have been disclosed to the Noteholders prior to the date hereof.

                           (s) LC Capital Side Letter. The Company has provided
to each of the Noteholders a true and complete signed copy of the LC Capital
Side Letter. The Indenture, this Agreement and the LC Capital Side Letter
constitute the only binding agreements between the Company and holders of Notes
relating to the purchase of Notes by or exchange of Notes with the Company or
any other members of the Group.

                  4.3. Representations and Warranties of the Holders. Each of
the Holders hereby severally, and not jointly, represents and warrants to the
Company that:

                           (a) Ownership of Claims, Notes and Capital Stock. As
of the date hereof, each of the Holders "Beneficially Owns" or is the
"Beneficial Owner" of (as such terms are defined in the Rights Plan) such number
of shares of Capital Stock and/or aggregate principal amount of Notes and/or
funded Loans (excluding any commitments in respect of outstanding but undrawn
letters of credit under the Existing Senior Facility, and subject to trades
pending between Holders) as is set forth next to its name on the signature pages
hereto, without giving effect to any Beneficial Ownership arising solely out of
being a party to this Agreement or the Purchase Option Agreement or Beneficial
Ownership of Common Stock arising solely out of the ownership of the Notes.
Subject to the foregoing sentence, the shares of Capital Stock, aggregate
principal amount of Notes, and aggregate principal amount of funded Loans set
forth next to the name of each Holder on the signature pages hereto constitute
the only shares of Capital Stock, Notes or funded Loans owned, beneficially
owned or otherwise directly or indirectly held by such Holder. Each Holder has
good title to all such Notes and Loans, free and clear of any Liens and any
options, warrants or rights to acquire any of the foregoing, in each case, that
would prevent or materially impair the performance of the obligations of the
Noteholders hereunder, and has full power and authority to assign and transfer
all such Notes and Loans.

                           (b) Status. The Holder understands that the Loan
Exchange and the Notes Exchange involve substantial risk. The Holder has
experience as an investor in securities of companies and acknowledges that it is
able to fend for itself, can bear the economic risk of an investment in the
Capital Stock and, to the extent applicable, the Series A Warrants and the New
Junior Secured Notes and has such knowledge and experience in financial or
business matters, that it is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of an
investment in the Capital Stock and, to the extent applicable, the Series A
Warrants and the New Junior Secured Notes and protecting its own interests in
connection with any such investment. Such Holder is an "accredited investor" as
defined in Rule 501 promulgated under the Securities Act.

                           (c) Investment Intent. The Holder is acquiring the
Shares of Capital Stock and, to the extent applicable, the Series A Warrants and
the New Junior Secured Notes issuable pursuant to the Transactions for its own
account and for investment purposes only and



                                       24
<PAGE>

not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution thereof
in violation of the Securities Act.

                           (d) Access to Information. The Holder has had an
opportunity to discuss the Company's business, management, and financial affairs
with the Company's management and the opportunity to review the Company's
business plan. The Holder has had an opportunity to ask questions of officers of
the Company, which questions were answered to its satisfaction. The Holder
acknowledges that it has had an opportunity to conduct its own independent due
diligence investigation of the Company.

                           (e) Brokers and Finders. Neither the Holder nor any
of its affiliates, officers, directors or employees has employed any broker or
finder or incurred any liability for any brokerage fees, commissions or finders'
fees in connection with the Transactions or the other transactions contemplated
hereby.

                           (f) Legal Proceedings. There are no actions, suits,
arbitrations or proceedings pending before any court or Governmental Entity
against it or, to the knowledge of such Holder, threatened against it, by any
court or Governmental Entity that individually or in the aggregate could
materially impair its ability to consummate the Transactions and such Holder is
not subject to any order of any court or Governmental Entity that individually
or in the aggregate is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on
its ability to consummate the Transactions.

                           (g) Confidentiality Agreements. Other than any
confidentiality agreements between the Holder and the Company, to such Holder's
knowledge, such Holder is not a party to any confidentiality agreement or
similar agreement that would prevent the Holder from disclosing information
required to be disclosed by it in connection with the consummation of the
Transactions.

                           (h) Restricted Securities. Each Holder agrees that,
at the time of issuance, the shares of Capital Stock to be issued, and
underlying Capital Stock to be issued, to the Noteholders, and the Series A
Warrants, the New Junior Secured Notes and the shares of Capital Stock
underlying the Series A Warrants to be issued to the Senior Lenders, hereunder
will not be registered under the Securities Act or qualified under any state
securities laws. Such securities are being issued on the basis that the Notes
Exchange and the Loan Exchange and the issuance by the Company of such
securities to such Holders under this Agreement are exempt from registration
under the Securities Act and from applicable state securities laws. Each Holder
agrees that the reliance by the Company on such exemptions is predicated, in
part, on such Holder's representations and warranties and other agreements set
forth in this Agreement. Each Holder acknowledges and agrees that each
certificate representing shares of Capital Stock, Series A Warrants or New
Junior Notes issued or underlying shares of Capital Stock or Series A Warrants
issued in the Transactions shall bear substantially the following legend and
that each certificate for shares of Series B Preferred Stock or Series A Warrant
shall bear any additional restrictive legends required by the certificate of
designation for the Series B Preferred Stock or the Warrant Agreement, as
applicable:



                                       25
<PAGE>

         THIS SECURITY HAS NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933,
         AS AMENDED (THE "SECURITIES ACT"), OR ANY APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES
         LAW AND MAY NOT BE TRANSFERRED UNLESS (i) THERE IS AN EFFECTIVE
         REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OR SUCH APPLICABLE
         STATE SECURITIES LAWS, OR (ii) IN THE OPINION OF COUNSEL REASONABLY
         ACCEPTABLE TO THE ISSUER, REGISTRATION UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OR SUCH
         APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS IS NOT REQUIRED IN CONNECTION WITH
         SUCH TRANSFER.

Subsidiaries' employees, agents and representatives (including any investment
banker, attorney or accountant retained by it or any of its Subsidiaries) not

any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer with respect to a merger,
reorganization, share exchange, consolidation or similar transaction involving

the Confidentiality Agreements (as defined below), it being understood that such
confidentiality agreement need not prohibit the



                                       27

making, or amendment, of an Alternative Proposal; (C) engaging in any
negotiations or discussions with any Person who has made an unsolicited bona
fide written Alternative Proposal; or (D) recommending such an Alternative
Proposal to the stockholders and noteholders of the Company, if and only to the
extent that in the case referred to in this clause (D), the Board of Directors
of the Company (i) determines in good faith after consultation with outside
legal counsel that such action is necessary in order for its directors to comply
with their fiduciary duties under applicable law and (ii) determines in good
faith (after consultation with its financial advisor) that such Alternative
Proposal, if accepted, is reasonably likely to be consummated, taking into
account all legal, financial and regulatory aspects of the proposal and the
Person making the proposal and would, if consummated, result in a transaction
more favorable from a financial point of view to the Company and the Persons to
whom fiduciary duties are owed by the Board of Directors than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (any such more favorable Alternative Proposal
being referred to in this Agreement as a "Superior Proposal"). The Company
agrees that it will take the necessary steps to promptly inform the individuals
or entities referred to in the first sentence hereof of the obligations
undertaken in this Section. The Company agrees that it will notify the Holders
immediately if any such inquiries, proposals or offers are received by, any such
information is requested from, or any such discussions or negotiations are
sought to be initiated or continued with, any of its representatives indicating,
in connection with such notice, the name of such Person and the material terms
and conditions of any proposals or offers and thereafter shall keep the Holders
informed, on a current basis, on the status and terms of any such proposals or
offers and the status of any such discussions or negotiations. The Company also
agrees that it will take all steps to maintain and enforce any heretofore
executed confidentiality agreements in connection with its consideration of a
potential Alternative Proposal.

                                   ARTICLE VI

                         Other Agreements and Covenants

                  6.1. Information Supplied. The Company and each of the Holders
agree, as to itself and, in the case of the Company, its Subsidiaries, that none
of the information supplied or to be supplied by it or its Subsidiaries for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Schedule 14A to be filed with the
SEC by the Company in connection with the Stockholders Meeting (as defined
below), including the proxy statement and related materials to be mailed to
holders of Capital Stock in connection with the Company's 2003 annual meeting of
stockholders to the extent practicable, or otherwise at a special meeting of
stockholders of the Company to be held as soon as possible following the Notes
Exchange Closing and the securing of the Stockholder Votes (the "Proxy
Statement") and any amendment or supplement thereto, will not at the date of
mailing to holders of Capital Stock and at the time of the Stockholders Meeting
(A) contain any untrue statement of material fact or (B) omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. The Company shall correct promptly any material information in
the Proxy Statement that shall have become false or misleading, and each of the
Holders shall promptly notify the Company in writing upon becoming aware that
any material information provided by it for use in the Proxy Statement shall
have become false or misleading, and the Company further agrees to take all
steps necessary to cause the Proxy Statement as so



                                       28
<PAGE>

corrected to be filed with the SEC and as so corrected to be disseminated to
holders of Capital Stock in each such case as and to the extent required by
applicable federal securities laws.

                  6.2. Stockholders Votes. The Company will take, in accordance
with applicable law and its Charter and By-Laws, all action necessary to convene
a meeting of holders of shares of Capital Stock (including any such meeting held
pursuant to an adjournment or postponement, the "Stockholders Meeting") as
promptly as practicable after the Proxy Statement is mailed to its stockholders
to consider and vote upon the approval of the Charter Amendment and adoption of
the New Equity Plan. Approval of the Charter Amendment will require the
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of
Capital Stock voting together as a single class (the "Charter Amendment
Requisite Vote"). Approval of the adoption of the New Equity Plan will require
the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of votes cast by holders of
the shares of Common Stock present and entitled to vote at a meeting duly called
therefor, provided that the total vote cast on such proposal represents over 50%
of all votes entitled to be cast thereon (the "Plan Vote" and together with the
Charter Amendment Requisite Vote, the "Stockholder Votes"). The Company's Board
of Directors, subject to Section 5.2 hereof, shall recommend such approvals and
shall take all lawful and reasonable action to solicit such approvals.

                  6.3. Filings; Other Actions; Notification.

                           (a) The Company shall promptly prepare and promptly
following the Notes Exchange Closing shall file with the SEC the Proxy
Statement. The Company shall use its best efforts to have the Proxy Statement
cleared for mailing to the stockholders of the Company under the Exchange Act as
promptly as practicable after the filing thereof and promptly thereafter shall
mail or cause to be mailed the Proxy Statement to the stockholders of the
Company. The Company shall also use its commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain prior to the Notes Exchange Closing and the Loan Exchange Closing all
necessary state securities law or "blue sky" permits and approvals required in
connection with the Transactions. The Company shall use all best efforts to
secure the Stockholder Votes, without paying any money or other consideration to
stockholders in respect thereof.

                           (b) Each party agrees that it shall cooperate with
the other parties and use (and cause its respective affiliates to use) its
respective commercially reasonable efforts to take or cause to be taken all
actions, and do or cause to be done all things, necessary, proper or advisable
on its part under this Agreement and applicable Laws to consummate and make
effective the Transactions and the other transactions contemplated hereby as
soon as practicable, including preparing and filing as promptly as practicable
all documentation to effect all necessary notices, reports and other filings and
to obtain as promptly as practicable all consents, registrations, approvals,
permits and authorizations necessary or advisable to be obtained from any third
party and/or any Governmental Entity in order to consummate the Transactions or
any of the other transactions contemplated hereby.

                           (c) Each member of the Group shall, at the request of
any Holder, and each Holder shall, at the request of the Company, furnish the
other party with all information concerning itself, its affiliates, directors,
officers and security holders and such other matters as may be reasonably
necessary or advisable in connection with the Proxy Statement or any other


                                       29
<PAGE>

required statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of the
Holders, the Company or any of their respective affiliates to any third party
and/or any court or Governmental Entity in connection with the Transactions and
the other transactions contemplated hereby. Subject to applicable Laws relating
to the exchange of information, the Holders and the Company shall have the right
to review in advance and, to the extent practicable, each will consult the other
on all the information relating to the Holders or the Group, as the case may be,
and any of their respective affiliates, that appear in any filing made with, or
written materials submitted to, any third party and/or any court or Governmental
Entity in connection with the Transactions and the other transactions
contemplated hereby. In exercising the foregoing rights, each of the parties
shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable.

                           (d) The Company, on the one hand, and each of the
Holders, on the other hand, shall keep the other apprised of the status of
matters relating to completion of the Transactions and the other transactions
contemplated hereby, including promptly furnishing the other with copies of
notice or other communications received by such Holder or the Group, as the case
may be, or any of its affiliates, from any third party and/or any court or
Governmental Entity with respect to the Transactions and the other transactions
contemplated hereby. The Company shall give prompt notice to the Holders of any
change that is reasonably likely to prevent or to materially impair or delay the
Company's ability to effect the Transactions and the other transactions
contemplated hereby.

                  6.4. Taxation. None of the Group shall take or cause to be
taken any action, whether before or after the Closing Date, that would
disqualify the exchange of the Notes for Capital Stock in the Notes Exchange as
a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a)(1)(E) of the Code.

                  6.5. Access. Upon reasonable notice, and except as may
otherwise be required by applicable law, each of the Group shall (and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to) afford, prior to the Notes Exchange Closing Date, any
Noteholder's officers, employees, counsel, accountants and other authorized
representatives and, prior to the Loan Exchange Closing Date, any Senior
Lender's officers, employees, counsel, accountants and other authorized
representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours throughout such
applicable period, to its properties, books, contracts and records and, during
such period, each shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly
to the other all information concerning its business, properties and personnel
as may reasonably be requested, provided that no investigation pursuant to this
Section shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty made
by the Company and, provided, further, that the foregoing shall not require the
Group to permit any inspection, or to disclose any information, that in the
reasonable judgment of the Company would result in the disclosure of any trade
secrets of third parties or violate any of its obligations with respect to
confidentiality if the Company shall have used commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain the consent of such third party to such inspection or disclosure. All
requests for information made pursuant to this Section shall be directed to an
executive officer of the Company or such Person as may be designated by the
Company. All such information shall be governed by the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreements.

                  6.6. Stock Exchange Listing. The Company shall use its best
efforts such that immediately after the Charter Amendment Requisite Vote is
obtained, the shares of Common



                                       30
<PAGE>

Stock, including those shares of Common Stock to be issued in the Notes Exchange
and the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series B
Preferred Stock issued in the Notes Exchange and upon exercise of the Series A
Warrants issued in the Loan Exchange, shall be approved for quotation on the
NASDAQ National Market System ("NASDAQ/NMS") or listing on the NYSE or the
American Stock Exchange or another "U.S. national securities exchange" or
"established automated over-the-counter trading market in the United States" (in
each case, within the meaning given to such terms in the Indenture), and shall
use its best efforts to maintain such status, including by amending the ratio
for the Reverse Split as reasonably necessary to satisfy the quotation or
listing requirements of the foregoing systems or exchanges and to maintain such
status.

                  6.7. Publicity. The Company and the Holders each shall consult
with each other prior to issuing any press releases or otherwise making public
announcements with respect to the Transactions and the other transactions
contemplated hereby except as may be required by Law.

                  6.8. Options; Stock Plans and Forms S-8.

                           (a) Options. Other than as disclosed in the
Disclosure Letter, the Group shall not take any action to cause or cause the
Transactions or other transactions contemplated hereby to result in the
acceleration of payment, vesting or exercisability of any benefit under any
Options, or any other incentive compensation arrangement or agreement. Prior to
the Notes Exchange Closing, the Company shall use all commercially reasonable
efforts to cancel, subject to completion of the Notes Exchange, each Option,
whether or not then exercisable, for either nominal or no cash payment.

                           (b) Stock Plan and Forms S-8. The Company shall take
any and all action required to terminate the Stock Plan prior to the Notes
Exchange Closing so that no Options or other awards remain reserved for grants
or issuance thereunder. As soon as practicable after the Notes Exchange Closing,
the Company shall file with the SEC a registration statement or statements on
Form S-8 (and any amendments to such currently filed Form S-8) with respect to
the termination of the Stock Plan and with respect to the Common Stock
underlying Options that remain outstanding under the Stock Plan and the new
options issued or issuable under the New Equity Plan, and shall use its best
efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement (and
maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein)
for so long as such Options and new options remain outstanding.

                  6.9. Expenses. The Group shall pay all charges and expenses
relating to the Transactions and the other transactions contemplated hereby and
by the Purchase Option Agreement, including fees and expenses of the Depositary
and expenses in connection with the printing and mailing of the Proxy Statement,
the making of any filings or mailings and obtaining of any approvals under the
Exchange Act, Securities Act or any state securities and "blue sky" laws. The
Group acknowledges and agrees that the reasonable fees and expenses of Stroock &
Stroock & Lavan LLP shall be paid by the Company, as billed, promptly after the
date hereof and in accordance with the Agreement in Principle and in any case
paid current on or prior to each of the Loan Exchange Closing Date, the Notes
Exchange Closing Date and the Charter Amendment Effective Time.

                  6.10. Indemnification; Directors' and Officers' Insurance.(a)
(a) From and after the Notes Exchange Closing Date, the Company agrees that it
will indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director and officer of
the Company determined as of the Notes Exchange Closing Date (the "D&O
Indemnified Parties") against any costs or expenses (including reasonable
attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities
(collectively, "Costs") incurred in their capacity as a director or officer in
connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining
to matters existing or occurring on or prior to the Notes Exchange Closing Date,
whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Notes Exchange Closing
Date, to the fullest extent that the Company would have been permitted under
Delaware law and its certificate of incorporation or by-laws in effect on the
date hereof to indemnify such Person (and the Company shall also advance
expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law,
provided the Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to
repay such advances if it is finally judicially determined (and such
determination is nonappealable) that such Person is not entitled to
indemnification).

                           (b) From and after the date hereof and whether or not
this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms or the Transactions
are consummated hereunder, the Company agrees that it will indemnify and hold
harmless each Noteholder as of the Notes Exchange Closing Date and its
directors, partners, stockholders, officers, advisors and agents (the
"Noteholder Indemnified Parties"), against any Costs incurred in their capacity
as a holder, or as a director, partner, stockholder, affiliates, officer,
advisor or agent thereof, in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
under the Exchange Act, the Securities Act, the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as
amended, or the Indenture and arising out of or pertaining to this Agreement,
the Transactions or the other transactions contemplated hereby and existing or
occurring on or prior to the Notes Exchange Closing Date, whether asserted or
claimed prior to, at or after the Notes Exchange Closing Date (and the Company
shall also advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable law, provided the Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an
undertaking to repay such advances if it is finally judicially determined (and
such determination is nonappealable) that such Person is not entitled to
indemnification); provided, that no Noteholder Indemnified Party shall be
entitled to indemnification or expense reimbursement hereunder to the extent
that the Costs are finally judicially determined (and such determination is
nonappealable) to arise solely out of such Noteholder Indemnified Party's gross
negligence or willful misconduct or of a material breach of a Holder's
representations, warranties or agreements hereunder.

                           (c) Any D&O Indemnified Party or Noteholder
Indemnified Party (collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") wishing to claim
indemnification under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section, as applicable, upon
learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, shall
promptly notify the Company thereof, but the failure to so notify shall not
relieve the Company of any liability it may have to such Indemnified Party
except to the extent such failure materially prejudices the Company. In the
event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether
arising before or after the Notes Exchange Closing Date), (i) the Company shall
have the right to assume the defense thereof and shall not be liable to such
Indemnified Parties for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other
expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Parties in connection with
the defense thereof, except that if the



                                       32
<PAGE>

Company elects not to assume such defense or counsel for the Indemnified Parties
advises that there are issues which raise conflicts of interest between the
Company and the Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel
satisfactory to them, and the Company shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses
of such counsel for the Indemnified Parties promptly as statements therefor are
received; provided, however, that the Company shall be obligated pursuant to
this paragraph (b) to pay for only one firm of counsel for all D&O Indemnified
Parties on the one hand and one firm of counsel for all Noteholder Indemnified
Parties on the other hand in any jurisdiction unless the use of one firm of
counsel would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the
Indemnified Parties will cooperate in the defense of any such matter and (iii)
the Company shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its prior
written consent; and provided, further, that the Company shall not have any
obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party to the extent a court of competent
jurisdiction shall finally determine, and such determination shall have become
nonappealable, that the indemnification of such Indemnified Party in the manner
contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable law. If any indemnity hereunder
is for any reason found not to be available with respect to any Indemnified
Party, then the Company and the Indemnified Party shall contribute to the amount
payable in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect relative faults and
benefits. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no Indemnified Party
shall have any rights to indemnification or contribution under this Section with
respect to Costs arising out of any claims, actions, suits or proceedings
initiated by such Indemnified Party (other than claims to enforce rights to
indemnification hereunder).

                           (d) The Company shall maintain the Company's existing
officers' and directors' liability insurance ("D&O Insurance") for directors and
officers serving at any time during the three-year period up to and including
the Notes Exchange Closing Date, for a period of six years after the Notes
Exchange Closing Date so long as the annual premium therefor is not in excess of
150% of the last annual premium paid prior to the date hereof (the "Current
Premium"); provided, however, that if the existing D&O Insurance expires, is
terminated or cancelled during such six-year period, the Company will use its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain D&O Insurance with substantially the
same coverage and containing substantially the same terms and conditions as
existing policies, or as much coverage as can be obtained for the remainder of
such period for a premium not in excess (on an annualized basis) of 150% of the
Current Premium.

                           (e) The Company, and its successors or assigns, shall
not (i) consolidate with or merge into any other corporation or entity and shall
not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation
or merger or (ii) sell, lease or transfer all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any individual, corporation or other entity, unless and
in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of the Company, on such properties and assets, shall assume or
effectively provide for all of the obligations set forth in this Section.

                           (f) The provisions of this Section are intended to be
for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified
Parties, their heirs and their successors, assigns and representatives.

                  after a written request by the Noteholders to do so (other

                  to Section 5.2 and terminating this Agreement pursuant to

                  8.4. Effect of Termination and Abandonment.

                           (a) In the event of a termination of this Agreement

applicable provisions of this Agreement (other than as set forth in Section 9.1)
shall become void and of no effect with no liability on the part of any party
hereto (or of any of its directors, officers, employees, agents, legal and
financial advisors or other representatives); provided, however, except as
otherwise provided herein, no such termination shall relieve any party hereto of
any liability or damages resulting from any breach of this Agreement.

                           (b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to Sections 8.2(a), 8.2(b)(i) or (b)(iii) or 8.3(c), then the Group

by any party pursuant to Section 8.3(a)(i), by the Company pursuant to Section
8.3(b)(ii)(B) or by the Noteholders pursuant to Section 8.3(c), the provisions
of Annex A shall thereafter become applicable; provided, however, that in the
case of termination by the Company pursuant to Section 8.3(b)(ii)(B) or by the
Noteholders pursuant to Section 8.3(c)(ii), the provisions of Annex A shall not
become applicable unless the terminating party, in its sole discretion, elects
to make Annex A applicable and notifies the other parties to the Agreement of
such election within five (5) business days after providing notice of
termination. The Group acknowledges that the agreements contained in this
paragraph are an integral part of the Transactions and the other transactions
contemplated hereby and that, without these agreements, the Holders would not
enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Group fails to promptly pay the
amount due pursuant to this paragraph, and, in order to obtain such payment, any
Holder commences a suit which results in a judgment against the any of the Group
for the fee set forth in this paragraph, the Group shall pay to the applicable
Holder its costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) in
connection with such suit, together with interest on the amount of the fee at
the U.S. prime rate of Citibank N.A. in effect on the date such payment was
required to be made.

herein are for convenience of reference only, do not constitute part of this
Agreement and shall not be deemed to limit or otherwise affect any of the
provisions hereof. Where a reference in this Agreement is made to a Section or
Annex or Exhibit, such reference shall be to a Section or Annex of or Exhibit to
this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include,"
"includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be
followed by the words "without limitation."

                  9.14. Assignment; Holder Transferees. This Agreement shall not
be assignable by operation of law or otherwise; provided, however, that to the
extent such would not result in a breach of any part of this Agreement, and
subject to the following sentence, any Holder may designate by written notice to
the Company and the other Holders a transferee of all or any portion of Notes or
Claims held by such Holder, in which event, to the extent of such transfer, all
references herein to such Holder in such capacity shall be deemed references to
such transferee except that all representations and warranties made herein with
respect to such Holder as of the date of this Agreement shall be deemed
representations and warranties made with respect to such transferee as of the
date of such designation. No Holder may transfer its Claims or Notes, as the
case may be, including pursuant to a foreclosure of a pledge, to any third party
unless such transferring Holder shall, prior to any such transfer, obtain from
the transferee a joinder agreement in a form reasonably satisfactory to the
Company and the other Holders and deliver a copy of such joinder agreement to
the Company and to the other Holders.

                  9.15. Allocation of Consideration. The parties hereto
acknowledge and agree that all consideration received by the Noteholders and
Senior Lenders in exchange for their Notes and Claims, respectively, shall be
allocated first, to a return of principal and second, to the payment of accrued
but unpaid interest. No party hereto shall take any position on any Tax Return
which is inconsistent with this allocation.

                  9.16. Knowledge. For purposes of this Agreement, the phrase
"to the knowledge of the executive officers of the Company" or "to knowledge of
the Company" or any variation thereof shall mean the actual knowledge of the
following officers of the Company: Larry L. Enterline, Chief Executive Officer;
James C. Hunt, President and Chief Financial Officer; Michael H. Barker,
President - IT Services Division; and Ken R. Bramlett, Jr. Senior Vice
President, General Counsel and Secretary, in each case, after reasonable inquiry
by such officers of those members of senior management having supervisory roles
with respect to the areas of the Company's business and operations that are the
subject of the representations and

warranties of the Company hereunder. For purposes of this Agreement, the phrase

investor or acquiror with regard to, any alternative plan of reorganization or
liquidation, any other recapitalization transaction for the Group or any new
investment in, loan to or acquisition of assets or stock of the Group, to the
extent any such solicitation, encouragement, support or discussions would be

contained herein shall limit the ability of any member of the Group to consult
with the Senior Lenders, the Original Senior Lenders or the Noteholders, or
their respective representatives, or to appear and be heard, concerning any

nothing in this Annex A shall require (a) the directors or officers of the
Company (in such person's capacity as a director or officer of the Company) to
take any action, or to refrain from taking any action, including withdrawing
support for the Back-up Plan, to the extent required to comply with his or her
fiduciary obligations under applicable Law, (b) any Holder or representative of
a Holder that is also a director or officer of the Company to take any action,
or to refrain from taking any action, to the extent required to comply with its
fiduciary obligations under Law applicable to actions of such director or
officer or (c) any Holder or representative of a Holder that is a member of a
statutory committee established in the Chapter 11 Cases to take any action, or
to refrain from taking any action, to the extent required to comply with
fiduciary obligations under Law applicable to actions of such member. Nothing
herein will limit or affect, or give rise to any liability, to the extent
required for discharge of the fiduciary obligations as described in this
Section.

pursuit and support of the Back-Up Plan. In such regard, it shall negotiate in
good faith the definitive documents implementing, achieving and relating to the
Back-Up Plan and the Restructuring, including the First-Day Motions, the
Definitive Documents, the Disclosure Statement Order and the Confirmation Order.

                  (B) Further Assurances. Each of the parties shall take such
actions as may be reasonably necessary to carry out the purposes and intent of
the Back Up Plan and this Agreement, including making and filing of any filings
or notices required with or to any Governmental Entity and the obtaining of any
consents therefrom (provided that no Senior Lender shall be required to incur
any expense, liability or other obligation or restriction) and shall refrain
from taking any action that would materially frustrate the purposes and intent
of the Back Up Plan and this Annex A, including proposing a plan that is not the
Back-Up Plan.

                  (C) Acknowledgment and Waiver of Certain Claims. The Group
acknowledges and agrees that (i) the Existing Senior Facility and the Indenture
and all instruments and documents executed in connection therewith constitute
valid and binding agreements of the Group, as applicable and (ii) for so long as
this Annex A is in effect, the Group will not assert any claim, counterclaim,
setoff or defense of any kind or nature, which would (other than as contemplated
or effectuated hereby) in any way affect the validity or enforceability of any
claim arising from the Debt or any Related Actions or in any way reduce or
affect the absolute and unconditional obligation of the Group to pay and/or
guarantee, as applicable, all of the obligations arising from the Debt or any
Related Actions; provided that any such claim, counterclaim, setoff or defense
possessed by the Group may be disclosed in the Disclosure Statement. This
Agreement is not and shall not be deemed a solicitation for consents to the
Back-Up Plan or a solicitation to tender or exchange any Debt or Related
Actions.

                  (D) Signing Definitive Documents. To the extent it is to be a
party thereto, it shall execute and deliver to the other parties thereto the
Definitive Documents.

                  (E) Fees. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the
Senior Lenders shall not be obligated to perform under this Annex A unless the
Group shall have fully discharged all of its obligations then due and owing,
except to the extent subject to a good faith dispute or as prohibited by the
Bankruptcy Court or required to be paid to the estate, under any existing
agreements between the Group and any Holder regarding the payment of fees and
expenses of such Holder or designated counsel or financial advisors of such
Holder in respect of the Restructuring (including the Agreement in Principle and
any agreement between the Company and Holders Counsel).

                                    (iii) Liquidation, Dissolution, Etc. In the
                  event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up (either

                  shares of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive the assets
                  and funds of the Corporation available for distribution after
                  payments to creditors and to the holders of any Preferred
                  Stock of the Corporation that may at the time be outstanding,
                  in proportion to the number of shares held by them,
                  respectively.

                                    (iv) Merger, Etc. In the event of a merger
                  or consolidation of the Corporation with or into another

                  shall have the power to issue and sell all or any part of any
                  shares of any class of stock herein or hereafter authorized to
                  such persons, and for such consideration, as the Board of
                  Directors shall from time to time, in its discretion,
                  determine, whether or not greater consideration could be
                  received upon the issue or sale of the same number of shares
                  of another class, and as otherwise permitted by law. Subject
                  to the requirements of applicable law, the Corporation shall
                  have the power to purchase any shares of any class of stock

be stated and expressed in the resolution or resolutions adopted by the Board of
Directors providing for the issuance of such class or series, in each case
subject to the terms of this Restated Certificate of Incorporation including
without limitation the following:

                  Fifth. The following provisions are inserted for the
management of the business and the conduct of the affairs of the Corporation,
and for further definition, limitation and regulation of the powers of the

                           (a) The business and affairs of the Corporation shall
be managed by or under the direction of the Board of Directors.



                                 Exhibit A-p.4
<PAGE>

                           (b) The Board of Directors shall consist of not less
than seven (7) nor more than nine (9) members, the exact number of which shall
be fixed from time to time in the manner provided in the By-Laws of the
Corporation, as amended from time to time (the "By-Laws"). The number of
directors constituting the Board of Directors shall be fixed at seven (7) as of
the date hereof. Election of directors need not be by written ballot unless the
By-Laws so provide.

                           (c) In addition to the powers and authority
hereinbefore or by statute expressly conferred upon them, the directors are
hereby empowered to exercise all such powers and do all such acts and things as
may be exercised or done by the Corporation, subject, nevertheless, to the
provisions of the GCL, this Restated Certificate of Incorporation, and any
By-Laws adopted by the stockholders; provided, however, that no By-Laws
hereafter adopted by the stockholders shall invalidate any prior act of the
directors which would have been valid if such By-Laws had not been adopted.

                  Sixth. No director shall be personally liable to the
Corporation or any of its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of
fiduciary duty as a director, except to the extent such exemption from liability
or limitation thereof is not permitted under the GCL as the same exists or may
hereafter be amended. If the GCL is amended hereafter to authorize the further
elimination or limitation of the liability of directors, then the liability of a
director of the Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent
authorized by the GCL, as so amended. Any repeal or modification of this Article
Sixth shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a director of the
Corporation existing at the time of such repeal or modification with respect to
acts or omissions occurring prior to such repeal or modification.

                  Seventh. The Corporation shall indemnify its directors and
officers to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by law, as now or
hereafter in effect, and such right to indemnification shall continue as to a
person who has ceased to be a director or officer of the Corporation and shall
inure to the benefit of his or her heirs, executors and personal and legal
representatives; provided, however, that, except for proceedings to enforce
rights to indemnification, the Corporation shall not be obligated to indemnify
any director or officer (or his or her heirs, executors or personal or legal
representatives) in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by
such person unless such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized or consented
to by the Board of Directors. The right to indemnification conferred by this
Article Seventh shall include the right to be paid by the Corporation the
expenses incurred in defending or otherwise participating in any proceeding in
advance of its final disposition.

                  The Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to
time by the Board of Directors, provide rights to indemnification and to the
advancement of expenses to employees and agents of the Corporation similar to
those conferred in this Article Seventh to directors and officers of the
Corporation.

                  The rights to indemnification and to the advance of expenses
conferred in this Article Seventh shall not be exclusive of any other right
which any person may have or hereafter acquire under this Restated Certificate
of Incorporation, the By-Laws, any statute, agreement, vote of stockholders or
disinterested directors or otherwise.



                                 Exhibit A-p.5
<PAGE>

                  Any repeal or modification of this Article Seventh shall not
adversely affect any rights to indemnification and to the advancement of
expenses of a director or officer of the Corporation existing at the time of
such repeal or modification with respect to any acts or omissions occurring
prior to such repeal or modification.

                  Eighth. Meetings of stockholders may be held within or without
the State of Delaware, as the By-Laws may provide. The books of the Corporation
may be kept (subject to any provision contained in the GCL) outside the State of
Delaware at such place or places as may be designated from time to time by the
Board of Directors or in the By-Laws.

                  Ninth. In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers
conferred upon it by the laws of the State of Delaware, the Board of Directors
shall have concurrent power with the stockholders to adopt, amend, alter, add to
or repeal the By-Laws. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Restated
Certificate of Incorporation (and in addition to any other vote that may be
required by law), for so long as there is a Significant Holder, either (i) the
approval of the Board of Directors, including the affirmative vote of at least
one of the persons designated as nominees by the Significant Holder prior to
their election to the Board of Directors and in accordance with the terms of the
By-Laws ("Significant Holder Designees"), or (ii) the affirmative vote of the
holders of at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the voting power of the shares
entitled to vote generally in the election of directors shall be required to
amend, alter, add to or repeal the By-Laws (including by merger, consolidation,
recapitalization or otherwise).

                  Tenth. The Corporation hereby elects not to be governed by
Section 203 of the GCL pursuant to Section 203(b)(3) therein.

                  Eleventh. The Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter,
change or repeal any provision contained in this Restated Certificate of
Incorporation in the manner now or hereafter prescribed in this Restated
Certificate of Incorporation, the By-Laws or the GCL, and all rights herein
conferred upon stockholders are granted subject to such reservation; provided,
however, that, notwithstanding any other provision of this Restated Certificate
of Incorporation (and in addition to any other vote that may be required by
law), for so long as there is a Significant Holder:

                           (a) subject to the following paragraph (b), either
(i) the recommendation or approval of the Board of Directors, including the
recommendation or affirmative vote of at least one of the Significant Holder
Designees, or (ii) the affirmative vote of the holders of at least seventy-five
percent (75%) of the voting power of the shares entitled to vote generally in
the election of directors, shall be required to amend, alter, change or repeal
any provision of this Restated Certificate of Incorporation or to adopt any
provisions inconsistent with the purpose and intent thereof (including by
merger, consolidation, recapitalization or otherwise); and

                           (b) the approval or affirmative vote of (i) any and
each Five Percent Holder and (ii) the Board of Directors by a vote of at least
eighty percent (80%) of the entire Board of Directors shall be required to
amend, alter, change or repeal Article Twelfth or to adopt any provisions
inconsistent with the purpose and intent of Article Twelfth hereof (including by
merger, consolidation, recapitalization or otherwise) but excluding any
amendment, alteration,



                                 Exhibit A-p.6
<PAGE>

change or repeal in connection with a merger, consolidation or similar
transaction with an entity that is not a Significant Holder or Controlled or
Controlling Affiliate thereof or a Subsidiary of the Corporation and that has
the result of causing the stockholders of the Corporation immediately prior to
such transaction to beneficially own less than fifty percent (50%) of the voting

                                    (iv) The term "Significant Holder" shall
                  mean any person (other than the Corporation or any Subsidiary
                  and other than any profit-sharing, employee stock ownership or
                  other employee benefit plan of the Corporation or any
                  Subsidiary or any trustee of or fiduciaries with respect to
                  any such plan when acting in such capacity) who, individually
                  or as a member of a group within the meaning of Rule 13d-5
                  under the Act, is the beneficial owner of Voting Stock
                  representing twenty percent (20%) or more of the votes
                  entitled to be cast by the holders of all then outstanding
                  shares of Voting Stock;

                                    (v) A person shall be a "beneficial owner"
                  of any Capital Stock (A) which such person or any of its
                  Controlled or Controlling Affiliates owns, directly or
                  indirectly; (B) which such person or any of its Controlled or
                  Controlling Affiliates has, directly or indirectly, (1) the

                  pursuant to any agreement, arrangement or understanding or
                  upon the exercise of conversation rights, exchange rights,
                  warrants or options or otherwise, or (2) the right to vote

                  (C) which are owned, directly or indirectly, by any other
                  person with which such person or any of its Controlled or
                  Controlling Affiliates has any agreement, arrangement or
                  understanding for the purpose of acquiring, holding, voting or
                  disposing of any shares of Capital Stock. For the purposes of
                  determining whether a person is a Significant Holder pursuant
                  to paragraph (c)(iv) of this Article Twelfth or a Controlled
                  or Controlling Affiliate pursuant to paragraph (c)(vi) of this
                  Article Twelfth, the number of shares of Capital Stock deemed

                  owned by such person through application of this paragraph
                  (c)(v) of this Article Twelfth, but shall not include any
                  other shares of Capital Stock that may be issuable pursuant to
                  any agreement, arrangement or understanding, or upon exercise
                  of conversion rights, warrants or options, or otherwise.

                                    (vi) The term "Controlled or Controlling
                  Affiliate" shall mean with respect to a specified person, a
                  person that directly or indirectly through one or more
                  intermediaries, controls or is controlled by, or is under
                  common control with, the person specified; provided that the
                  Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall not, and the executive
                  officers or directors of the Corporation or any of its
                  Subsidiaries shall not, solely as a result of holding such
                  office, be deemed a "Controlled or Controlling Affiliate" of a
                  Significant Holder; and provided, further, that for purposes
                  of this definition, the term "control" (including the terms
                  "controlling," "controlled by" and "under common control
                  with") shall mean the possession direct or indirect, of the
                  power to direct or cause the direction of the management and
                  policies of a person through the ownership of more than fifty
                  percent (50%) of the voting securities of such person or the
                  ability to otherwise designate a majority of the board of
                  directors or managers of such person.

                                    (vii) The term "Subsidiary" means any
                  company or other entity of which a majority of any class of
                  equity security is beneficially owned by the Corporation;
                  provided, however, that for the purposes of the definition of
                  Significant Holder set forth in paragraph (c)(iv) of this
                  Article Twelfth, the term "Subsidiary" shall mean only a
                  company of which a majority of each class of equity security
                  is beneficially owned by the Corporation.

                                    (viii) The term "Five Percent Holder" means
                  any person (other than the Corporation or any Subsidiary and
                  other than any profit-sharing, employee stock ownership or
                  other employee benefit plan of the Corporation or any
                  Subsidiary or any trustee of or fiduciaries with respect to
                  any such plan when acting in such capacity) who, as of the
                  record date (if any) established for any applicable
                  transaction or vote (or if there is no record date, as of the
                  date of consummation of the transaction) and based on the most
                  recent reports or disclosures filed publicly under the Act,
                  individually or as a member of a group within the meaning of
                  Rule 13d-5 under the Act, is the beneficial owner of Voting
                  Stock representing five percent (5%) or more of the votes
                  entitled to be cast by



                                 Exhibit A-p.11
<PAGE>

                  the holders of all then outstanding shares of Voting Stock;
                  provided that for purposes of this definition only, a person
                  who reports or discloses beneficial ownership as a member of a
                  group or by virtue of a relationship with other persons with
                  respect to the Voting Stock, shall not be deemed to
                  beneficially own any shares of Voting Stock held by persons
                  beneficially owning Voting Stock representing two percent (2%)
                  or less of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of all
                  then outstanding shares of Voting Stock and any such person
                  beneficially owning Voting Stock representing two percent (2%)
                  or less of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of all
                  then outstanding shares of Voting Stock shall not be deemed a
                  Five Percent Holder or otherwise be entitled to exercise any
                  rights of a Five Percent Holder.

                                    (ix) The term "Related Party" means, in
                  connection with any Related Party Transaction, any person who
                  at any time during the eighteen (18) month period preceding
                  such Related Party Transaction constituted a Significant
                  Holder.

                                    (x) The term "entire Board of Directors" as
                  used in this Article Twelfth and in this Restated Certificate
                  of Incorporation, generally, means the total number of
                  directors of the Corporation then holding office and entitled
                  to vote.

                           (d) The Board of Directors shall for purposes of this
Article Twelfth be entitled to rely on information contained in the most recent
disclosures filed publicly under the Act as to (i) whether a person is a
Significant Holder, (ii) the number of shares of Capital Stock or other
securities beneficially owned by any person, and (iii) whether a person is a
Controlled or Controlling Affiliate of another. Any such decision made in good
faith on such basis shall be conclusive. Any persons deemed Significant Holders
or Five Percent Holders solely by virtue of being a member of a group or having
a relationship with other persons, which membership or relationship is described
in disclosures filed publicly under the Act, shall at the request of the
Corporation, select one designee to act on their behalf with respect to any
rights or obligations hereunder.



                  IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the corporation has caused this Restated
Certificate of Incorporation to be signed by Larry Enterline, its Chief
Executive Officer, this ____ day of _____________, 2003.

                                   ARTICLE I

                                  Stockholders

                  Section 1.1 Annual Meetings. Unless directors are elected by
written consent in lieu of an annual meeting as permitted by this subsection, an
annual meeting of stockholders shall be held for the election of directors on a
date and at a time designated by or in the manner provided in these By-Laws.
Stockholders may, unless the certificate of incorporation otherwise provides,
act by written consent to elect directors.

                  Section 1.2 Nature of Business at Meetings of Stockholders. No
business may be transacted at an annual meeting of stockholders, other than
business that is either (a) specified in the notice of meeting (or any
supplement thereto) given by or at the direction of the Board of Directors (or
any duly authorized committee thereof), (b) otherwise properly brought before
the annual meeting by or at the direction of the Board of Directors (or any duly
authorized committee thereof) or (c) otherwise properly brought before the
annual meeting by any stockholder of the Corporation (i) who is a stockholder of
record on the date of the giving of the notice provided for in this Section 1.2
and on the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to vote at
such annual meeting and (ii) who complies with the notice procedures set forth
in this Section 1.2.

                           In addition to any other applicable requirements, for
business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder, such
stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in proper written form to the
Secretary of the Corporation.

                           To be timely, a stockholder's notice to the Secretary
must be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices
of the Corporation not less than sixty (60) days nor more than ninety (90) days
prior to the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting of
stockholders; provided, however, that in the event that the annual meeting is
called for a date that is not within thirty (30) days before or after such
anniversary date, notice by the stockholder in order to be timely must be so
received not later than the close of business on the tenth (10th) day following
the day on which such notice of the date of the annual meeting was mailed or
such public disclosure of the date of the annual meeting was made, whichever
first occurs.

<PAGE>


                           To be in proper written form, a stockholder's notice
to the Secretary must set forth as to each matter such stockholder proposes to
bring before the annual meeting (i) a brief description of the business desired
to be brought before the annual meeting and the reasons for conducting such
business at the annual meeting, (ii) the name and record address of such
stockholder, (iii) the class or series and number of shares of capital stock of
the Corporation which are owned beneficially or of record by such stockholder,
(iv) a description of all arrangements or understandings between such
stockholder and any other person or persons (including their names) in
connection with the proposal of such business by such stockholder and any
material interest of such stockholder in such business and (v) a representation
that such stockholder intends to appear in person or by proxy at the annual
meeting to bring such business before the meeting.

                           No business shall be conducted at the annual meeting
of stockholders except business brought before the annual meeting in accordance
with the procedures set forth in this Section 1.2, provided, however, that, once
business has been properly brought before the annual meeting in accordance with
such procedures, nothing in this Section 1.2 shall be deemed to preclude
discussion by any stockholder of any such business. If the Chairman of an annual
meeting determines that business was not properly brought before the annual
meeting in accordance with the foregoing procedures, the Chairman shall declare
to the meeting that the business was not properly brought before the meeting and
such business shall not be transacted.

                  Section 1.3 Special Meetings. Special meetings of stockholders
may be called at any time by any officer of the Corporation at the written
request of the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer or a majority
of the Board of Directors, or at the request in writing of stockholders owning a
majority of the capital stock of the Corporation issued and outstanding and
entitled to vote. Such request shall state the purpose or purposes of the
proposed meeting. Any such special meeting shall be held at such date, time and
place either within or without the State of Delaware as may be stated in the
notice of the meeting.

                  Section 1.4 Notice of Meetings; Remote Participation. Whenever
stockholders are required or permitted to take any action at a meeting, a
written notice of the meeting shall be given which shall state the place, date
and hour of the meeting, and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or
purposes for which the meeting is called. Unless otherwise provided by law, the
written notice of any meeting shall be given, not less than ten (10) nor more
than sixty (60) days before the date of the meeting, to each stockholder
entitled to vote at such meeting. If mailed, such notice shall be deemed to be
given when deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, directed to the
stockholder at such stockholder's address as it appears on the records of the
Corporation. Rather than holding a meeting at any place, the Board of Directors
may determine that a meeting shall be held solely by means of remote
communications, which means shall meet the requirements of the Delaware General
Corporation Law. The Board of Directors may permit the stockholders and their
proxy holders to participate in meetings of the stockholders (whether such
meetings are held at a designated place or solely by means of remote
communication) using one or more methods of remote communication that satisfy
the requirements of the Delaware General Corporation Law. The Board of Directors
may adopt such guidelines and procedures applicable to participation in
stockholders' meetings by means of remote communication as it deems appropriate.
Participation in a stockholders' meeting by means of a method of remote
communication permitted by the Board of Directors shall constitute presence in
person at the meeting.

                  Section 1.5 Adjournments. Any meeting of stockholders, annual
or special, may be adjourned from time to time by the Chairman of the meeting,
to reconvene at the same or some



                                 Exhibit B-p.2
<PAGE>

other place, and notice need not be given of any such adjourned meeting if the
time and place thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is
taken. At the adjourned meeting the Corporation may transact any business which
might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for
more than thirty (30) days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is
fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be
given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting.

                  Section 1.6 Quorum. At each meeting of stockholders, except
where otherwise provided by law or the certificate of incorporation or these
by-laws, the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of stock entitled
to vote on a matter at the meeting, present in person or represented by proxy,
shall constitute a quorum. For purposes of the foregoing, where a separate vote
by class or classes is required for any matter, the holders of a majority of the
outstanding shares of such class or classes, present in person or represented by
proxy, shall constitute a quorum to take action with respect to that vote on
that matter. Two or more classes or series of stock shall be considered a single
class if the holders thereof are entitled to vote together as a single class at
the meeting. In the absence of a quorum of the holders of any class of stock
entitled to vote on a matter, or of all stockholders, the holders of such class
so present or represented or of all stockholders may, by majority vote, adjourn
the meeting of such class, or of the whole, from time to time in the manner
provided by Section 1.5 of these by-laws until a quorum of such class, or of the
whole, shall be so present or represented. Shares of its own capital stock
belonging on the record date for the meeting to the Corporation or to another
corporation, if a majority of the shares entitled to vote in the election of
directors of such other corporation is held, directly or indirectly, by the
Corporation, shall neither be entitled to vote nor be counted for quorum
purposes; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not limit the right of the
Corporation to vote stock, including but not limited to its own stock, held by
it in a fiduciary capacity.

                  Section 1.7 Organization. Meetings of stockholders shall be
presided over by the Chairman of the Board, or in the absence of the Chairman of
the Board, by a chairman designated by the Board of Directors, or in the absence
of such designation by a chairman chosen at the meeting. The Secretary, or in
the absence of the Secretary an Assistant Secretary, shall act as secretary of
the meeting, but in the absence of the Secretary and any Assistant Secretary the
chairman of the meeting may appoint any person to act as secretary of the
meeting.

                           The order of business at each such meeting shall be
as determined by the chairman of the meeting. The chairman of the meeting shall
have the right and authority to prescribe such rules, regulations and procedures
and to do all such acts and things as are necessary or desirable for the proper
conduct of the meeting, including, without limitation, the establishment of
procedures for the maintenance of order and safety, limitations on the time
allotted to questions or comments on the affairs of the Corporation,
restrictions on entry to such meeting after the time prescribed for the
commencement thereof and the opening and closing of the voting polls.

                  Section 1.8 Inspectors. Prior to any meeting of stockholders,
the Board of Directors or the President shall appoint one or more inspectors to
act at such meeting and make a written report thereof and may designate one or
more persons as alternate inspectors to replace any inspector who fails to act.
If no inspector or alternate is able to act at the meeting of stockholders, the
person presiding at the meeting shall appoint one or more inspectors to act at
the meeting. Each inspector, before entering upon the discharge of his or her
duties, shall take and sign an oath faithfully to execute the duties of
inspector with strict impartiality and according to the best of his or her
ability. The inspectors shall ascertain the number of shares outstanding and the
voting power of



                                 Exhibit B-p.3
<PAGE>

each, determine the shares represented at the meeting and the validity of
proxies and ballots, count all votes and ballots, determine and retain for a
reasonable period a record of the disposition of any challenges made to any
determination by the inspectors and certify their determination of the number of
shares represented at the meeting and their count of all votes and ballots. The
inspectors may appoint or retain other persons to assist them in the performance
of their duties. The date and time of the opening and closing of the polls for
each matter upon which the stockholders will vote at a meeting shall be
announced at the meeting. No ballot, proxy or vote, nor any revocation thereof
or change thereto, shall be accepted by the inspectors after the closing of the
polls. In determining the validity and counting of proxies and ballots, the
inspectors shall be limited to an examination of the proxies, any envelopes
submitted therewith, any information provided by a stockholder who submits a
proxy by telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission from which it can
be determined that the proxy was authorized by the stockholder, ballots and the
regular books and records of the corporation, and they may also consider other
reliable information for the limited purpose of reconciling proxies and ballots
submitted by or on behalf of banks, brokers, their nominees or similar persons
which represent more votes than the holder of a proxy is authorized by the
record owner to cast or more votes than the stockholder holds of record. If the
inspectors consider other reliable information for such purpose, they shall, at
the time they make their certification, specify the precise information
considered by them, including the person or persons from whom they obtained the
information, when the information was obtained, the means by which the
information was obtained and the basis for the inspectors' belief that such
information is accurate and reliable.

                  Section 1.9 Voting; Proxies.

                           (a) Unless otherwise provided in the certificate of
incorporation, each stockholder entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders
shall be entitled to one vote for each share of stock held by such stockholder
which has voting power upon the matter in question. If the certificate of
incorporation provides for more or less than one vote for any share on any
matter, every reference in these by-laws to a majority or other proportion of
stock shall refer to such majority or other proportion of the votes of such
stock. Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders or to
express consent or dissent to corporate action in writing without a meeting may
authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder by proxy, but no
such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from its date, unless
the proxy provides for a longer period. A duly executed proxy shall be
irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable and if, and only as long as, it
is coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power,
regardless of whether the interest with which it is coupled is an interest in
the stock itself or an interest in the Corporation generally. A stockholder may
revoke any proxy which is not irrevocable by attending the meeting and voting in
person or by filing an instrument in writing revoking the proxy or another duly
executed proxy bearing a later date with the Secretary of the Corporation.

                           (b) Without limiting the manner in which a
stockholder may authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder
as proxy, the following shall constitute a valid means by which a stockholder
may grant such authority:

                                    (i) A stockholder may execute a writing
authorizing another person or persons to act for such stockholder as proxy.
Execution may be accomplished by the stockholder or such stockholder's
authorized officer, director, employee or agent signing such writing or causing
such person's signature to be affixed to such writing by any reasonable means,
including, but not limited to, by facsimile signature.



                                 Exhibit B-p.4
<PAGE>

                                    (ii) A stockholder may authorize another
person or persons to act for such stockholder as proxy by transmitting or
authorizing the transmission of a telegram, cablegram or other means of
electronic transmission to the person who will be the holder of the proxy or to
a proxy solicitation firm, proxy support service organization or like agent duly
authorized by the person who will be the holder of the proxy to receive such
transmission, provided that any such telegram, cablegram or other means of
electronic transmission must either set forth or be submitted with information
from which it can be determined that the telegram, cablegram or other electronic
transmission was authorized by the stockholder. If it is determined that such
telegrams, cablegrams or other electronic transmissions are valid, the
inspectors or, if there are no inspectors, such other persons making that
determination shall specify the information on which they relied.

                                    Any copy, facsimile telecommunication or
         other reliable reproduction of the writing or transmission authorizing
         another person or persons to act as proxy for a stockholder may be
         substituted or used in lieu of the original writing or transmission for
         any and all purposes for which the original writing or transmission
         could be used; provided, however, that such copy, facsimile
         telecommunication or other reproduction shall be a complete
         reproduction of the entire original writing or transmission.

                           (c) Voting at meetings of stockholders need not be by
written ballot and need not be conducted by inspectors unless the holders of a
majority of the outstanding shares of all classes of stock entitled to vote
thereon present in person or represented by proxy at such meeting shall so
determine. Directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes of the shares
present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on
the election of directors. In all other matters, unless otherwise provided by
law or by the certificate of incorporation or these by-laws, the affirmative
vote of the holders of a majority of the shares present in person or represented
by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter shall be the
act of the stockholders. Where a separate vote by class or classes is required,
the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of such class or
classes present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting shall be the
act of such class or classes, except as otherwise provided by law or by the
certificate of incorporation or these by-laws.

                  Section 1.10 Fixing Date for Determination of Stockholders of
Record. In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to
notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof,
the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not
precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by
the Board of Directors, and which record date shall not be more than sixty nor
less than ten days before the date of such meeting. If no record date is fixed
by the Board of Directors, the record date for determining stockholders entitled
to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of
business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if
notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on
which the meeting is held. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to
notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment
of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new
record date for the adjourned meeting.

                           In order that the Corporation may determine the
stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a
meeting, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall
not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted
by the Board of Directors, and which date shall not be more than ten days after
the date upon



                                 Exhibit B-p.5
<PAGE>

which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of
Directors. Any stockholder of record seeking to have the stockholders authorize
or take corporate action by written consent shall, by written notice to the
secretary, request the Board of Directors to fix a record date. The Board of
Directors shall promptly, but in all events within ten days of the date on which
such request is received, adopt a resolution fixing the record date. If no
record date has been fixed by the Board of Directors within ten days of the date
on which such request is received, the record date for determining stockholders
entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no
prior action by the Board of Directors is required by applicable law, shall be
the first date on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken
or proposed to be taken is delivered to the Corporation by delivery to its
registered office in the State of Delaware, its principal place of business, or
an officer or agent of the Corporation having custody of the book in which
proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded. Delivery made to the
Corporation's registered office shall be by hand or by certified or registered
mail, return receipt requested. If no record date has been fixed by the Board of
Directors and prior action by the Board of Directors is required by law, the
record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action
in writing without a meeting shall be at the close of business on the day on
which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution taking such prior action.

                           In order that the Corporation may determine the
stockholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution
or allotment of any rights or the stockholders entitled to exercise any rights
in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock, or for the purpose of
any other lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which
record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the
record date is adopted, and which record date shall be not more than sixty days
prior to such action. If no record date is fixed, the record date for
determining stockholders for any such purpose shall be at the close of business
on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution relating
thereto.

                  Section 1.11 List of Stockholders Entitled to Vote. The
Secretary shall prepare and make, at least ten days before every meeting of
stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the
meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each
stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder.
Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose
germane to the meeting, for a period of a least ten days prior to the meeting
either (a) on a reasonably accessible electronic network, provided that the
information required to gain access to such list is provided with notice of the
meeting, or (b) during ordinary business hours, for a period of at least ten
days prior to the meeting, either at a place within the city where the meeting
is to be held, which place shall be specified in the notice of the meeting, or,
if not so specified, at the place where the meeting is to be held. The list
shall also be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the
whole time thereof and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present.

                  Section 1.12 Consent of Stockholders in Lieu of Meeting.
Unless otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation, any action
required by law to be taken at any annual or special meeting of stockholders of
the Corporation, or any action which may be taken at any annual or special
meeting of such stockholders, may be taken without a meeting, without prior
notice and without a vote, if a consent or consents in writing, setting forth
the action so taken, shall be signed by the holders of outstanding stock having
not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize
or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon
were present and voted. Every written consent shall bear the date of signature
of each stockholder who signs the consent and no written consent shall be
effective to take the corporate action referred



                                 Exhibit B-p.6
<PAGE>

to therein unless, within sixty days of the earliest dated consent duly executed
and delivered to the Corporation, written consents signed by a sufficient number
of holders to take action are delivered to the Corporation. Prompt notice of the
taking of the corporate action without a meeting by less than unanimous written
consent shall be given to those stockholders who have not consented in writing
and who, if the action had been taken at a meeting, would have been entitled to
notice of the meeting if the record date for such meeting had been the date that
written consents signed by a sufficient number of stockholders to take the
action were delivered to the Corporation as provided in this Section 1.12.

                                   ARTICLE II

                               Board of Directors

                  Section 2.1 Powers; Number; Qualifications. The business and
affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by or under the direction of the
Board of Directors, except as may be otherwise provided by law or in the
certificate of incorporation. The Board of Directors shall consist of not less
than seven (7) nor more than nine (9) members or as otherwise set forth in the
certificate of incorporation, the exact number of which shall initially be fixed
upon adoption of these by-laws at seven (7) and, thereafter, shall be fixed from
time to time by resolution of the Board of Directors (the "Board Resolution") or
by resolution adopted by the holders of a majority of the capital stock of the
Corporation issued and outstanding and entitled to vote (the "Stockholder
Resolution"); provided that in the event of any conflict between the Board
Resolution and the Stockholder Resolution, the Stockholder Resolution shall
govern. Directors need not be stockholders.

                  Section 2.2 Significant Holder Nominees and Observers;
Management Nominees.

                           (a) In connection with any election of directors by
the stockholders and, in each case, to the extent permitted by law and by
applicable rules or listing standards of any securities exchange or market on
which any of the Corporation's securities are listed or approved for trading,
the nominees shall be (and for any such nominees to be qualified to serve as
directors they shall be) nominated as follows:

                                    (i) For so long as there are one or more

number of nominees for election to the Board of Directors as shall be required
such that immediately following such election, no less than two of the directors
comprising the Board of Directors shall be persons who were designated as
nominees by the Significant Holders prior to their election to the Board of
Directors ("Significant Holder Designees"). Significant Holders shall further
have the right to select two representatives in addition to such Significant
Holder Designees (the "Observers"), who shall be permitted to attend all
meetings of the Board of Directors, including all committees thereof, solely in
a non-voting observer capacity provided the Significant Holders inform the
Chairman of the Board of Directors in writing of the identity of the Observers
prior to any such meeting. If there is more than one Significant Holder at the
time any action is to be taken or any determination to be made regarding the
designation of Significant Holder Designees (including the removal of, or the
filling of vacancies created by, Significant Holder Designees in accordance with
this Restated Certificate of Incorporation) or the selection of Observers, any
such action or determination shall be taken or made by the affirmative vote of
the holders of a majority of the shares of Voting Stock voted by such
Significant Holders in such action or determination. To the extent



                                 Exhibit B-p.7
<PAGE>

permitted by law and in any applicable rule or listing standard of any
securities exchange or market on which any of the Corporation's securities are
listed or approved for trading, Significant Holder Designees shall be members of
each committee of the Board of Directors, and Observers shall be entitled to
attend meetings of each such committee. The term "Significant Holder" shall mean
any person (other than the Corporation or any Subsidiary and other than any
profit-sharing, employee stock ownership or other employee benefit plan of the
Corporation or any Subsidiary or any trustee of or fiduciaries with respect to
any such plan when acting in such capacity) who is the beneficial owner of
Voting Stock representing twenty percent (20%) or more of the votes entitled to
be cast by the holders of all then outstanding shares of Voting Stock. The term
"Voting Stock" shall mean all Capital Stock which by its terms may be voted on
all matters submitted to stockholders of the Corporation generally, and the term
"Capital Stock" shall mean all capital stock of the Corporation authorized to be
issued from time to time under the certificate of incorporation.

                                    (ii) The Chief Executive Officer of the
Corporation (the "Chief Executive Officer"), if there be one, and otherwise the
executive officer exercising the powers and discharging the duties of the
senior-most executive of the Corporation (the "Acting CEO"), shall have the
right to designate in writing, and in accordance with the timing and other
applicable requirements set forth by resolution of the Board of Directors or the
Governance or Nominating Committee of the Corporation, at least one member of
senior management of the Corporation as a nominee for election to the Board of
Directors (the "Management Designee").

                                    (iii) Except as otherwise set forth in the
certificate of incorporation, all nominees for election to the Board of
Directors other than those designated pursuant to (i) or (ii) above shall be
designated in accordance with Sections 2.4 and 3.2 of these by-laws.

                           (b) As a condition to exercising the right to
designate any Significant Holder Designees or Observers, Significant Holders
shall agree to be present at any meeting of stockholders duly called for the
election of directors and to vote all shares of Voting Stock (as hereinafter
defined) held by them in favor of the slate of director nominees recommended by
the Board of Directors at any such meeting or any adjournment or postponement
thereof.

                           (c) In order to be eligible for election to the Board
of Directors, any Significant Holder Designee shall be an Eligible Person. For
purposes hereof, an "Eligible Person" shall mean (x) the Significant Holder or
any executive officer thereof and (y) any other person other than a person whose
election to the Board of Directors, in the written opinion of counsel for the
Corporation, is reasonably likely to violate or conflict with, or result in any
material limitation on the ownership or operation of any business or assets of
the Corporation or its Subsidiaries under, any statute, law, ordinance,
regulation, rule, judgment, decree or order of any court or governmental or
regulatory authority.

                           (d) Significant Holders shall provide the Corporation
with timely notice of any determinations regarding designations of Significant
Holder Designees and any Observers. To be timely, a notice informing the
Corporation of the Significant Holder Designees to be nominated for election to
the Board of Directors by the stockholders shall be delivered in writing to the
Governance or Nominating Committee of the Corporation not less than twenty (20)
days prior to the mailing of proxy statement to be distributed to stockholders
in connection with the annual meeting of stockholders; provided the Corporation
shall give the Significant Holders, at least sixty (60) days prior written
notice of such mailing date. Any such notice given by the Significant Holders


                                 Exhibit B-p.8
<PAGE>

reasonably would be required to be disclosed in a proxy statement or other
filings required to be made in connection with solicitations of proxies for
election of directors pursuant to Section 14 of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder. To be timely, a notice informing the Corporation of the Significant
Holder Designee being designated to fill a vacancy in a seat held by a
Significant Holder Designee shall be delivered no later than thirty (30) days
following the delivery of written notice from the Corporation to the effect that
such a vacancy exists. To be timely, information regarding the identity of
Observers (including changes in the selection of Observers) selected to attend a
Board or committee meeting shall be delivered in writing to the attention of the
Chairman of the Board of Directors or, in the case of a committee meeting, may
instead be delivered to the attention of the chairman of such committee, at
least 24 hours prior to the meeting. Once the Corporation has been informed of
the identity of the Observers, no additional notice shall be required in
connection with individual meetings unless and until there is a change in the
selection of the Observers.

                  Section 2.3 Election; Term of Office; Resignation: Removal;
Vacancies. Each director shall hold office until his or her successor is elected
and qualified, subject, however, to his or her earlier death, resignation,
retirement, disqualification or removal from office. Any director may resign at
any time upon written notice to the Board of Directors or to the President or
the Secretary of the Corporation. Such resignation shall take effect at the time
specified therein, and unless otherwise specified therein no acceptance of such
resignation shall be necessary to make it effective. Any director or the entire
Board of Directors may be removed, with or without cause, by the holders of a
majority of the shares then entitled to vote at an election of directors.
Subject to the provisions in the certificate of incorporation (including the

office, although less than a quorum, or by the sole remaining director, and the
directors so chosen shall hold office until their successors are duly elected
and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation, retirement,
disqualification or removal from office; provided, however, that any vacancy in
a seat belonging to a Significant Holder Designee, whether by resignation or
otherwise, shall be filled by an individual who prior thereto shall have been
designated or approved in writing by the Significant Holder(s), and any vacancy
in the seat belonging to the Management Designee, whether by resignation or
otherwise, shall be filled by an executive officer of the Corporation who prior
thereto shall have been designated or approved in writing by the Chief Executive
Officer or the Acting CEO, as applicable.


                  Section 2.4 Nomination of Directors. Only persons who are

                                   ARTICLE III

                                   Committees

                  Section 3.1 Committees. The Board of Directors may designate
one or more committees, each committee to consist of one or more of the
directors of the Corporation, subject to the last sentence of this Section 3.1.
The Board may designate one or more directors as alternate members of any
committee, who may replace any absent or disqualified member at any meeting of
the committee. In the absence or disqualification of a member of a committee,
the member or members thereof present at any meeting and not disqualified from
voting, whether or not such member or members constitute a quorum, may
unanimously appoint another member of the Board to act at the meeting in the
place of any such absent or disqualified member. Any such committee, to the
extent provided in the resolution of the Board of Directors or in these by-laws,
shall have and may exercise all the powers and authority of the Board of
Directors in the management of the business and affairs of the Corporation, and
may authorize the seal of the Corporation to be affixed to all papers which may
require it; but no such committee shall have the power or authority in reference
to the following matters: (i) approving or adopting, or recommending to the
stockholders, any action or matter expressly required by law to be submitted to
stockholders for approval, (ii) adopting, amending or repealing these By-Laws or
(iii) removing or indemnifying directors. The Significant Holder Designees
shall, unless they otherwise request, be members of each committee of the Board
of Directors, subject to applicable law and any rule or listing standard of any
securities exchange or market on which any of the Corporation's securities are
listed or approved for trading.

                  Section 3.2 Special Committee of Significant Holders. For so
long as there are any Significant Holder(s), in connection with any election of
directors by the stockholders (and, in each case, to the extent permitted by law
and by applicable rules or listing standards of any securities exchange or
market on which any of the securities of the Corporation are listed or approved
for trading), a committee comprised of the Significant Holder Designees and one
Independent Director (as hereinafter defined) selected by majority vote of all
of the Independent Directors on the Board of Directors (the "Special Nominating
Committee") shall be responsible for designating nominees (and for any such
nominees to be qualified to serve as directors they shall be nominated) as
follows:

                           (a) If the Significant Holder(s) are the beneficial
owners of Voting Stock representing forty percent (40%) or more of the votes
entitled to be cast by the holders of all then outstanding Voting Stock, the
Special Nominating Committee shall have the right to designate in writing, and
in accordance with the eligibility, timing and other applicable requirements in
these by-laws, nominees to fill the maximum number of available seats for
Independent Directors on the Board of Directors such that immediately following
such election, up to four (4) of the Independent Directors serving on the Board
of Directors shall have been designated nominees for election by the Special
Nominating Committee.

                           (b) If the Significant Holder(s) are the beneficial
owners of Voting Stock representing thirty percent (30%) or more, but less than
forty percent (40%), of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of all then
outstanding Voting Stock, the Special Nominating Committee shall have the right
to designate in writing, and in accordance with the eligibility, timing and
other applicable requirements in these by-laws, nominees to fill the maximum
number of available seats for Independent Directors on the Board of Directors
such that immediately following such election, up to three (3) of the

                           (c) If the Significant Holder(s) are the beneficial
owners of Voting Stock representing twenty percent (25%) or more, but less than
thirty percent (30%), of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of all
then outstanding Voting Stock, the Special Nominating Committee shall have the
right to designate in writing, and in accordance with the eligibility, timing
and other applicable requirements in these by-laws, nominees to fill the maximum
number of available seats for Independent Directors on the Board of Directors
such that immediately following such election, up to two (2) of the Independent
Directors serving on the Board of Directors shall have been designated nominees
for election by the Special Nominating Committee.

                           (d) If the Significant Holder(s) are the beneficial

nominees to fill the maximum number of available seats for Independent Directors
on the Board of Directors such that immediately following such election, one of
the Independent Directors serving on the Board of Directors shall have been
designated a nominee for election by the Special Nominating Committee.

                           (e) To be timely, a notice informing the Corporation
of the nominees designated by the Special Nominating Committee for election to
the Board of Directors shall be delivered in writing to the Governance or
Nominating Committee of the Corporation not less than twenty (20) days prior to
the mailing of proxy statement to be distributed to stockholders in connection
with the annual meeting of stockholders; provided the Corporation shall give the
Special Nominating Committee at least sixty (60) days prior written notice of

shall also contain as to each person whom the Special Nominating Committee has
designated as a nominee for election as a director (i) the name, age, business
address and residence address of the person, (ii) the principal occupation or
employment of the person, (iii) the class or series and number of shares of

filings required to be made in connection with solicitations of proxies for
election of directors pursuant to Section 14 of the Exchange Act and the rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder.

                           (f) Any vacancy in a seat belonging to an Independent
Director who was designated as a nominee for election to the Board of Directors
by the Special Nominating Committee, whether by resignation or otherwise, shall
be filled by an individual who prior thereto shall have been designated or

                           (g) In order to be eligible for election, any persons
designated nominees by the Special Nominating Committee must qualify as
Independent Directors. For purposes hereof, "Independent Director" shall mean
those directors of the Board of Directors who are not Significant Holder
Designees or officers of the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries and who
qualify as "independent" under the rules or listing standards of any securities
exchange or market on which any of the Corporation's securities are listed or

                  Section 3.3 Committee Rules. Unless the Board of Directors
otherwise provides, each committee designated by the Board may adopt, amend and
repeal rules for the conduct of its business. In the absence of a provision by
the Board or a provision in the rules of such committee to



                                 Exhibit B-p.13
<PAGE>

the contrary, a majority of the entire authorized number of members of such
committee shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, the vote of
a majority of the members present at a meeting at the time of such vote if a
quorum is then present shall be the act of such committee, and in other respects
each committee shall conduct its business in the same manner as the Board
conducts its business pursuant to Article II of these by-laws.

                                   ARTICLE IV

                                    Officers

                  Section 4.1 Officers; Election. As soon as practicable after
the annual meeting of stockholders in each year, the Board of Directors shall
elect a President and a Secretary, and it may, if it so determines, elect from
among its members a Chairman of the Board and a Vice Chairman of the Board. The
Board may also elect one or more Vice Presidents, one or more Assistant Vice
Presidents, one or more Assistant Secretaries, a Treasurer and one or more
Assistant Treasurers and such other officers as the Board may deem desirable or
appropriate and may give any of them such further designations or alternate
titles as it considers desirable. Any number of offices may be held by the same
person unless the certificate of incorporation or these by-laws otherwise
provide.

                  Section 4.2 Term of Office; Resignation; Removal; Vacancies.
Unless otherwise provided in the resolution of the Board of Directors electing
any officer, each officer shall hold office until his or her successor is
elected and qualified or until his or her earlier resignation or removal. Any
officer may resign at any time upon written notice to the Board or to the
Chairman or Chief Executive Officer, if any, or to the President or Secretary of
the Corporation. Such resignation shall take effect at the time specified
therein, and unless otherwise specified therein no acceptance of such
resignation shall be necessary to make it effective. The Board may remove any
officer with or without cause at any time. Any such removal shall be without
prejudice to the contractual rights of such officer, if any, with the
Corporation, but the election of an officer shall not of itself create
contractual rights. Any vacancy occurring in any office of the Corporation by
death, resignation, removal or otherwise may be filled by the Board at any
regular or special meeting.

                  Section 4.3 Powers and Duties. The officers of the Corporation
shall have such powers and duties in the management of the Corporation as shall
be stated in these by-laws or in a resolution of the Board of Directors which is
not inconsistent with these by-laws and, to the extent not so stated, as
generally pertain to their respective offices, subject to the control of the
Board. The Secretary shall have the duty to record the proceedings of the
meetings of the stockholders, the Board of Directors and any committees in a
book to be kept for that purpose. The Board may require any officer, agent or
employee to give security for the faithful performance of his or her duties.

Corporation shall be entitled to have a certificate signed by or in the name of
the Corporation by the Chairman or Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors or a
President of the Corporation, and by the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary, of
the Corporation, representing the number of shares of stock in the Corporation
owned by such holder. If such certificate is manually signed by one officer or
manually countersigned by a transfer agent or by a registrar, any other
signature on the certificate may be a facsimile. In case any



                                 Exhibit B-p.14
<PAGE>

officer, transfer agent or registrar who has signed or whose facsimile signature
has been placed upon a certificate shall have ceased to be such officer,
transfer agent or registrar before such certificate is issued, it may be issued
by the Corporation with the same effect as if such person were such officer,
transfer agent or registrar at the date of issue.

                           If the Corporation is authorized to issue more than
one class of stock or more than one series of any class, the powers,
designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special
rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications or
restrictions of such preferences and/or rights shall be set forth in full or
summarized on the face or back of the certificate which the Corporation shall
issue to represent such class or series of stock, provided that, except as
otherwise provided by law, in lieu of the foregoing requirements, there may be
set forth on the face or back of the certificate which the Corporation shall
issue to represent such class or series of stock a statement that the
Corporation will furnish without charge to each stockholder who so requests the
powers, designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other
special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications,
limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights.

                  Section 5.2 Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Stock Certificates;
Issuance of New Certificates. The Corporation may issue a new certificate of
stock in the place of any certificate theretofore issued by it, alleged to have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, and the Corporation may require the owner of the
lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, or such owner's legal representative, to
give the Corporation a bond sufficient to indemnify it against any claim that
may be made against it on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of
any such certificate or the issuance of such new certificate.

                               Fundamental Actions

                           For so long as there are any Significant Holders, the
         following matters shall require (in addition to any other vote required
         by law, the certificate of incorporation or these by-laws) either (a)
         the approval of the Board of Directors, including the affirmative vote
         of at least one of the Significant Holder Designees, or (b) the

of the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries that are material to the
Corporation and its subsidiaries taken as a whole;

                           (ii) the liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of
the Corporation;

                           (iii) any merger or other business combination or
reorganization other than one (A) where the transaction has been approved by the
unanimous vote of the entire Board of Directors or (B) where the holders of
Voting Stock of the Corporation prior to such transaction will beneficially own
(within the meaning of the certificate of incorporation) in the aggregate at
least eighty percent (80%) of the surviving corporation's Voting Stock,
immediately after giving effect to such transaction; or



                                 Exhibit B-p.15

                           (iv) any amendment to the certificate of
incorporation or the by-laws.

corporate seal may be used by causing it or a facsimile thereof to be impressed
or affixed or in any other manner reproduced.

                  Section 7.3 Waiver of Notice of Meetings of Stockholders,
Directors and Committees. Whenever notice is required to be given by law or
under any provision of the certificate of incorporation or these by-laws, a
written waiver thereof, signed by the person entitled to notice, whether before
or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to notice.
Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such
meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for the express purpose of
objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business
because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to
be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the
stockholders, directors or members of a committee of directors need be specified
in any written waiver of notice unless so required by the certificate of
incorporation or these by-laws.

                  Section 7.4 Indemnification of Directors, Officers and
Employees. The Corporation shall indemnify to the full extent permitted by law
any person made or threatened to be made a party to any action, suit or
proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, by reason
of the fact that such person or such person's testator or intestate is or was
after the date of adoption of these by-laws, a director, officer or employee of
the Corporation or serves or served after the date of adoption of these by-laws,
at the request of the Corporation or any other enterprise as a director, officer
or employee. Expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, incurred by any
such person in defending any such action, suit or proceeding shall be paid or
reimbursed by the Corporation promptly upon receipt by it of an undertaking of
such person to repay such expenses if it shall ultimately be determined that
such person is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation. The rights
provided to any person by this by-law shall be enforceable against the
Corporation by such person who shall be presumed to have relied upon it in
serving, after the date of adoption of these by-laws or continuing to serve,
after the date of adoption of these by-laws, as a director, officer or employee
as provided above. No amendment of this by-law shall impair the rights of any
person arising at any time with respect to events occurring prior to such
amendment. For purposes of this by-law, the term "Corporation" shall include any
successor of the Corporation and any constituent corporation (including any
constituent of a constituent) absorbed by the Corporation in a consolidation or
merger; the term "other enterprise" shall include any corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust or employee benefit plan; service "at the request of the
Corporation" shall include service as a director, officer or employee of the
Corporation which imposes duties on, or involves services by, such director,
officer or employee with respect to an employee benefit plan, its participants
or beneficiaries; any excise taxes assessed on a person with respect to an
employee benefit plan shall be deemed to be indemnifiable expenses; and action
by a person with respect to an



                                 Exhibit B-p.16
<PAGE>

employee benefit plan which such person reasonably believes to be in the
interest of the participants and beneficiaries of such plan shall be deemed to
be action not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation.

                           The rights to indemnification and to the advance of
expenses conferred in this section shall not be exclusive of any other right
which any person may have or hereafter acquire under these by-laws, any statue,
agreement, vote of stockholders or the Board of Directors, or otherwise.

                  Section 7.5 Interested Directors; Quorum. No contract or
transaction between the Corporation and one or more of its directors or
officers, or between the Corporation and any other corporation, partnership,
association or other organization in which one or more of its directors or
officers are directors or officers, or have a financial interest, shall be void
or voidable solely for this reason, or solely because the director or officer is
present at or participates in the meeting of the Board of Directors or committee
thereof which authorizes the contract or transaction, or solely because his or
her or their votes are counted for such purpose, if: (1) the material facts as
to his or her relationship or interest and as to the contract or transaction are
disclosed or are known to the Board or the committee, and the Board or committee
in good faith authorizes the contract or transaction by the affirmative votes of
a majority of the disinterested directors, even though the disinterested
directors be less than a quorum; or (2) the material facts as to his or her
relationship or interest and as to the contract or transaction are disclosed or
are known to the stockholders entitled to vote thereon, and the contract or
transaction is specifically approved in good faith by vote of the stockholders;
or (3) the contract or transaction is fair as to the Corporation as of the time
it is authorized, approved or ratified, by the Board, a committee thereof or the
stockholders. Common or interested directors may be counted in determining the
presence of a quorum at a meeting of the Board of Directors or of a committee
which authorizes the contract or transaction.

                  Section 7.6 Form of Records. Any records maintained by the
Corporation in the regular course of its business, including its stock ledger,
books of account and minute books, may be kept on, or be in the form of, punch
cards, magnetic tape, photographs, microphotographs or any other information
storage device, provided that the records so kept can be converted into clearly
legible form within a reasonable time. The Corporation shall so convert any
records so kept upon the request of any person entitled to inspect the same.

                  Section 7.7 Amendment of By-Laws. These by-laws may be
altered, amended or repealed, in whole or in part, or new by-laws may adopted,
by the stockholders or by the Board of Directors as provided in the certificate
of incorporation and this Article VII; provided, however, that notice of such
alteration, amendment, repeal or adoption of new by-laws be contained in the
notice of such meeting of stockholders or Board of Directors, as the case may
be.

                  Section 7.8 Interpretation. As used in these by-laws, the term
"entire Board of Directors" means the total number of directors of the
Corporation then holding office and entitled to vote.

                           not be redeemable.

RECUSAL:                   Holders will cause any director nominees to recuse
                           themselves from any deliberation or consideration of
                           actions to cause the Company to initiate Automatic

STANDSTILL:                Issuer will not make payments (other than by delivery
                           of additional Junior Notes to make quarterly interest

                           acceleration).

                           Registrable Securities effected pursuant to a Shelf

                           which the Noteholder may become subject insofar as
                           such losses, claims, damages or liabilities arise out
                           of or are based on any untrue or alleged untrue
                           statement or any fact contained in any registration
                           statement, unless the liability relates to material
                           furnished in writing by the Noteholder to the Company
                           specifically for use in the registration statement.

Selection of Underwriters: In connection with any Demand Registration or any
                           Shelf Registration that takes the form of an
                           underwritten offering, the Noteholders holding a
                           majority of the Registrable Securities participating
                           in such registration shall select the underwriters in
                           connection with the sale of registered securities,
                           with the approval of the Company, such approval not
                           to be unreasonably withheld.

Assignability:             The Noteholders may assign all registration rights,
                           provided the assignment is made in connection with a
                           transfer of the Registrable Securities and such
                           transfer is made in accordance with the provisions of
                           the New Rights Plan and the Charter.

Delay of Filing or Sales:  If (i) the Board of Directors of the Company
                           determines that filing a registration statement or
                           maintaining the effectivness of a

<PAGE>

                           current registration statement would have a material
                           adverse effect on the Company or its stockholders in
                           relation to any material acquisition or disposition,
                           financing or other corporate transaction and the
                           Company has determined in good faith that disclosure
                           thereof would not be in the best interests of the
                           Company and its stockholders at the time requested by
                           the Noteholders or (ii) the Company has determined in
                           good faith that filing a registration statement or
                           maintaining the effectiveness of a current
                           registration statement would require disclosure of
                           material information the Company has a valid business
                           purpose of retaining as confidential at such time,
                           the Company shall be entitled to postpone filing or
                           suspend the use by the Noteholder of the Demand
                           Registration or Shelf Registration for a reasonable
                           period of time, but not in excess of 60 consecutive
                           calendar days. The Company shall be entitled to
                           exercise such postponement or suspension rights more
                           than one time in any calendar year; provided that
                           such exercise shall not prevent the Noteholders from
                           being entitled to at least 240 days of effective
                           registration rights per year and that no postponement
                           or suspension period may commence if it is less than
                           30 calendar days from the prior such suspension
                           period. Other than the initial Shelf Registration
                           contemplated above, the Company shall not be
                           obligated to effect any Shelf Registration within 120
                           days after the effective date of a previous
                           registration statement filed by the Company (except
                           for registrations on Form S-4 or Form S-8, or other
                           forms prescribed under the Securities Act for the
                           same purpose or for an exchange offer).

Cutbacks:                  If a registration by the Company of its securities
                           involves an underwritten offering, and the managing
                           or lead underwriter or underwriters shall advise the
                           Company in writing (a copy of which shall be provided
                           by the Company to the Noteholders), that in its or
                           their opinion, the number of Registrable Securities
                           requested and otherwise proposed to be included in
                           such registration exceeds the number that can be sold
                           in such offering within a price range acceptable to
                           the Company, then the Company shall allocate the
                           securities to be included in such registration as
                           follows: First, the Company shall be entitled to
                           include all of the securities that they have proposed
                           to be included, and second, to the extent that any
                           other securities may be included without exceeding
                           the limitations recommended by the underwriter as
                           aforesaid, the Noteholders shall be entitled to
                           participate in that registration pro rata among any
                           shares of Registrable Securities that the Noteholders
                           requested for inclusion in the incidental
                           registration (or on such other proportion mutually
                           agreed by the Noteholders).
