language of the arbitration will be in English. The fees and expenses of the arbitrator shall be shared equally by the parties and advanced by them from time to time as required; provided, that at the conclusion of the arbitration, the arbitrator
may award costs and expenses (including the costs of the arbitration previously advanced and the fees and expenses of attorneys, accountants and other experts), plus interest, to the prevailing party to the extent that in the judgment of the
arbitrator it is fair to do so. No pre-arbitration discovery shall be permitted, except that the arbitrator shall have the power in his or her sole discretion, on application by any party, to order pre-arbitration examination solely of those
witnesses and documents that any other party intends to introduce in its case-in-chief at the arbitration hearing. The arbitrator shall render his or her award within 90 days of the conclusion of the arbitration hearing. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary provided in this Section 4.7 and without prejudice to the above procedures, either party may apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for temporary injunctive or other provisional judicial relief if such action is necessary to avoid
irreparable damage or to preserve the status quo until such time as the arbitration panel is convened and available to hear such party&#146;s request for temporary relief. The award rendered by the arbitrator shall be final and not subject to
