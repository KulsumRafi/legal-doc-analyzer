         obligated in any manner to perform any of the obligations of an Obligor
         under or pursuant to any Account (or any agreement giving rise
         thereto), contract or agreement, to make any payment, to make any
         inquiry as to the nature or the sufficiency of any payment received by

         Agreement. The Agent in its own name or in the name of others may

         the Agent's satisfaction the existence, amount and terms of any
         Accounts.

                           (ii)     Except as set forth on Schedule 1(b) hereto,
                  all Material Intellectual Property of each Obligor is valid,
                  subsisting, unexpired, enforceable

                                       7

                  and has not been abandoned, and each Obligor is legally
                  entitled to use each of its trade names.

                           (iii)    Except as set forth on Schedule 1(b) hereto,
                  as of the date hereof, none of the Intellectual Property of
                  the Obligors is the subject of any licensing or franchise
                  agreement.

                           (iv)     No holding, decision or judgment has been
                  rendered by any Governmental Authority which would limit,
                  cancel or question the validity of any Material Intellectual
                  Property of the Obligors, other than any such holding,
                  decision or judgment with respect to an immaterial portion of
                  any Patent application which application constitutes Material
                  Intellectual Property.

                           (v)      No action or proceeding is pending seeking
                  to limit, cancel or question the validity of any Material
                  Intellectual Property of the Obligors, other than any such
                  action or proceeding which the Obligor and the Agent determine
                  to be frivolous in their reasonable independent judgment.

                           (vi)     All applications pertaining to the Material
                  Intellectual Property of each Obligor have been duly and
                  properly filed, and all registrations or letters pertaining to
                  the Material Intellectual Property of such Obligor have been
                  duly and properly filed and issued.

                           (vii)    No Obligor has made any assignment or
                  agreement in conflict with the security interest of the Agent
                  in the Intellectual Property of each Obligor hereunder.

                  (j)      Documents, Instruments and Chattel Paper. All
         Documents, Instruments and Chattel Paper describing, evidencing or
         constituting Collateral are, to the Obligors' knowledge, complete,
         valid, and genuine, in all material respects.

                  (k)      Equipment. With respect to each Obligor's Equipment:
         (i) such Obligor has good and marketable title thereto or a valid
         leasehold interest therein; and (ii) all such Equipment is in normal
         operating condition and repair, other than ordinary wear and tear and
         normal obsolescence, and is suitable for the uses to which it is
         customarily put in the conduct of such Obligor's business.

                  (l)      Restrictions on Security Interest. Other than as
         shown on Schedule 4(l) hereto, none of the Obligors is party to any
         material license or any material lease that contains legally
         enforceable restrictions on the granting of a security interest therein
         unless such restrictions have been waived in writing to the
         satisfaction of the Agent.

         5.       Covenants. Each Obligor covenants that so long as any of the
Secured Obligations remain outstanding or any Credit Document or Lender Hedging
Agreement is in

                                       8

<PAGE>

effect or any Letter of Credit shall remain outstanding, and until all of the
Commitments shall have been terminated, such Obligor shall:

                  (a)      Other Liens. Defend the Collateral against the claims
         and demands of all third parties claiming an interest therein, and keep
         the Collateral free from all Liens, except for Permitted Liens. Neither
         the Agent nor any Lender authorizes any Obligor to, and no Obligor
         shall, sell, exchange, transfer, assign, lease or otherwise dispose of
         the Collateral or any interest therein, except as permitted under the
         Credit Agreement.

                  (b)      Preservation of Collateral. Keep the Collateral in
         good order, condition and repair in all material respects; not use the
         Collateral in violation of the provisions of this Security Agreement;
         not use the Collateral in violation of the provisions of any policy
         insuring the Collateral; and not use the Collateral in violation of the
         provisions of any applicable statute, law, bylaw, rule, regulation or
         ordinance, unless such violations, individually or in the aggregate,
         could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

                  (c)      Possession or Control of Certain Collateral. If (i)
         any amount payable under or in connection with any of the Collateral
         shall be or become evidenced by any Instrument, Tangible Chattel Paper
         or Supporting Obligation or (ii) if any Collateral shall be stored or
         shipped subject to a Document or (iii) if any Collateral shall consist
         of Investment Property in the form of certificated securities,
         immediately notify the Agent of the existence of such Collateral and,
         at the request of the Agent, deliver such Instrument, Chattel Paper,
         Supporting Obligation, Document or Investment Property to the Agent,
         duly endorsed in a manner satisfactory to the Agent, to be held as
         Collateral pursuant to this Security Agreement. If any Collateral shall
         consist of Deposit Accounts, Chattel Paper in electronic form,
         Letter-of-Credit Rights or uncertificated Investment Property, execute
         and deliver (and, with respect to any Collateral consisting of
         uncertificated Investment Property, cause the Securities Intermediary,
         if any, with respect to such Investment Property to execute and
         deliver) to the Agent, upon the Agent's request, all control
         agreements, assignments, instruments or other documents as reasonably
         requested by the Agent for the purposes of obtaining and maintaining
         Control of such Collateral within the meaning of the UCC (or equivalent
         local law).

                  (d)      Changes in Corporate Structure or Location. Not,
         without providing 30 days prior written notice to the Agent and without
         filing (or confirming that the Agent has filed) such amendments to any
         previously filed financing statements as the Agent may require, (i)
         alter its corporate existence or, in one transaction or a series of
         transactions, merge into or consolidate with any other entity, or sell
         all or substantially all of its assets, (ii) change its state of
         incorporation or formation, (iii) change its registered corporate name,
         (iv) change the location of its chief executive office and chief place
         of business (as well as its books and records) from the locations set
         forth on Schedule 6.22 to the Credit Agreement (as such Schedule may be
         updated from time to time pursuant to Section 7.21 of the Credit
         Agreement) or (v) change the location of its Collateral from the
         locations set

                                       9

<PAGE>

         forth for such Obligor on Schedule 6.22 to the Credit Agreement (as
         such Schedule may be updated from time to time pursuant to Section 7.21
         of the Credit Agreement).

                  (e)      Inspection. Allow the Agent or its representatives to
         visit and inspect the Collateral as set forth in Section 7.12 of the
         Credit Agreement.

                  (f)      Perfection of Security Interest. Authorize the Agent
         to prepare and file such financing statements (including renewal
         statements and in lieu statements) or amendments thereof or supplements
         thereto or other instruments as the Agent may from time to time deem
         necessary or appropriate in order to perfect and maintain the security
         interests granted hereunder in accordance with the UCC (or equivalent
         local law). Any financing statement filed by the Agent may contain a
         general description of the collateral covered thereby, as permitted by
         the UCC, which may state that the security interest attaches to all
         personal property of the debtor. Each Obligor shall also execute, if
         necessary, and deliver to the Agent such agreements, assignments or
         instruments (including affidavits, notices, reaffirmations and
         amendments and restatements of existing documents, as the Agent may
         reasonably request) and do all such other things as the Agent may
         reasonably deem necessary or appropriate (i) to assure to the Agent its
         security interests hereunder are perfected, including (A) such
         financing statements (including renewal statements and in lieu
         statements) or amendments thereof or supplements thereto or other
         instruments as the Agent may from time to time reasonably request in
         order to perfect and maintain the security interests granted hereunder
         in accordance with the UCC and any other personal property security
         legislation in the appropriate state(s) or province(s), (B) with regard
         to Copyrights, a Notice of Grant of Security Interest in Copyrights for
         filing with the United States Copyright Office or in any similar office
         or agency of the United States or any other country, substantially in
         the form of Schedule 5(f)(i) attached hereto, (C) with regard to
         Patents, a Notice of Grant of Security Interest in Patents for filing
         with the United States Patent and Trademark Office or in any similar
         office or agency of the United States or any other country,
         substantially in the form of Schedule 5(f)(ii) attached hereto and (D)
         with regard to Trademarks, a Notice of Grant of Security Interest in
         Trademarks for filing with the United States Patent and Trademark
         Office or in any similar office or agency of the United States or any
         other country, substantially in the form of Schedule 5(f)(iii) attached
         hereto, (ii) to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and
         (iii) to otherwise protect and assure the Agent of its rights and
         interests hereunder. To that end, each Obligor hereby makes,
         constitutes and appoints the Agent, its nominee or any other person
         whom the Agent may designate, as such Obligor's attorney-in-fact with
         full power and for the limited purpose to sign in the name of such
         Obligor any such financing statements, or amendments and supplements to
         financing statements, in lieu statements, renewal financing statements,
         notices or any similar documents which in the Agent's reasonable
         discretion would be necessary, appropriate or convenient in order to
         perfect and maintain perfection of the security interests granted
         hereunder, such power, being coupled with an interest, being and
         remaining irrevocable so long as any of the Secured Obligations remain
         outstanding or any Credit Document or Lender Hedging Agreement is in
         effect or any Letter of Credit shall remain outstanding and until all
         of the Commitments shall have terminated. Each

                                       10

<PAGE>

         Obligor hereby agrees that a carbon, photographic or other reproduction
         of this Security Agreement or any such financing statement is
         sufficient for filing as a financing statement by the Agent without
         notice thereof to such Obligor wherever the Agent may in its sole
         discretion desire to file the same. In the event for any reason the law
         of any jurisdiction other than New York, Canada or any province thereof
         becomes or is applicable to the Collateral of any Obligor or any part
         thereof, or to any of the Secured Obligations, such Obligor agrees to
         execute and deliver all such instruments and to do all such other
         things as the Agent in its sole discretion reasonably deems necessary
         or appropriate to preserve, protect and enforce the security interests
         of the Agent under the law of such other jurisdiction (and, if an
         Obligor shall fail to do so promptly upon the request of the Agent,
         then the Agent may execute any and all such requested documents on
         behalf of such Obligor pursuant to the power of attorney granted
         hereinabove). Each Obligor agrees to mark its books and records to
         reflect the security interest of the Agent in the Collateral.

                  (g)      Collateral Held by Warehouseman, Bailee, etc. If any
         Collateral valued at $100,000 or more is at any time in the possession
         or control of a warehouseman, bailee or any agent or processor of such
         Obligor, (i) notify the Agent of such possession, (ii) notify such
         Person of the Agent's security interest for the benefit of the Lenders
         in such Collateral, and (iii) assist the Agent in obtaining executed
         Acknowledgment Agreements from such Person.

                  (h)      Treatment of Accounts. (i) Comply with all provisions
         of the Credit Agreement relating to the establishment and maintenance
         of the Lockboxes, (ii) comply with all reporting requirements set forth
         in the Credit Agreement with respect to Accounts, (iii) not grant or
         extend the time for payment of any Account, or compromise or settle any
         Account for less than the full amount thereof, or release any person or
         property, in whole or in part, from payment thereof, or allow any
         credit or discount thereon, other than as normal and customary in the
         ordinary course of an Obligor's business and (iv) maintain at its
         principal place of business a record of Accounts consistent with
         customary business practices.

                  (i)      Covenants Relating to Inventory.

                           (i)      Maintain, keep and preserve its Inventory in
                  good salable condition at its own cost and expense, other than
                  a de minimis amount of Inventory which, in the ordinary course
                  of the Obligors' business, fails to be so maintained, kept and
                  preserved.

                           (ii)     Comply with all reporting requirements set
                  forth in the Credit Agreement with respect to Inventory.

                           (iii)    If any of the Inventory is at any time
                  evidenced by a document of title, promptly upon request by the
                  Agent, deliver such document of title to the Agent.

                  (j)      Covenants Relating to Copyrights.

                           (i)      Employ the Copyright for each material work
                  which is subject to copyright protection pursuant to Title 17
                  of the United States Code with such notice of copyright as may
                  be required by law to secure copyright protection, except as
                  could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
                  Effect.

                           (ii)     Not do any act or knowingly omit to do any
                  act whereby any Copyright of the Obligors may become
                  invalidated, except to the extent that the invalidation of
                  such Copyright could not reasonably be expected to have a
                  Material Adverse Effect and (A) not do any act, or knowingly
                  omit to do any act, whereby any Copyright constituting
                  Material Intellectual Property may become injected into the
                  public domain; (B) promptly notify the Agent if it has
                  knowledge that any Copyright constituting Material
                  Intellectual Property may become injected into the public
                  domain or of any adverse determination or development
                  (including, without limitation, the institution of, or any
                  such determination or development in, any proceeding in any
                  court or tribunal in the United States or any other country)
                  regarding an Obligor's ownership of any such Copyright or its
                  validity; (C) take all necessary steps as it shall deem
                  appropriate under the circumstances, to maintain and pursue
                  each application (and to obtain the relevant registration) and
                  to maintain each registration of each Copyright constituting
                  Material Intellectual Property owned by an Obligor, including,
                  without limitation, filing of applications for renewal where
                  necessary; and (D) promptly notify the Agent of any
                  infringement of any Copyright of an Obligor constituting
                  Material Intellectual Property of which it becomes aware and
                  take such actions as it shall reasonably deem appropriate
                  under the circumstances to protect such Copyright, including,
                  where appropriate, the bringing of suit for infringement,
                  seeking injunctive relief and seeking to recover any and all
                  damages for such infringement.

                           (iii)    Not make any assignment or agreement in
                  conflict with the security interest in the Copyrights of each
                  Obligor hereunder.

                           (i)      (A) Continue to use each Trademark
                  constituting Material Intellectual Property in order to
                  maintain such Trademark in full force free from any claim of
                  abandonment for non-use, (B) maintain as in the past the
                  quality of products and services offered under such Trademark,
                  (C) employ such Trademark with the appropriate notice of
                  registration, (D) not adopt or use any mark which is
                  confusingly similar or a colorable imitation of such Trademark
                  unless the Agent, for the benefit of the Lenders, shall obtain
                  a perfected security interest in such mark pursuant to this
                  Security Agreement, and (E) not (and not permit any licensee
                  or sublicensee thereof to) do any act or knowingly omit to do
                  any act whereby any such Trademark may become invalidated.

                           (ii)     Not do any act, or omit to do any act,
                  whereby any Patent constituting Material Intellectual Property
                  may become abandoned or dedicated to the public domain.

                           (iii)    Promptly notify the Agent if it has
                  knowledge that any application or registration relating to any
                  Patent or Trademark constituting Material Intellectual
                  Property may become abandoned or dedicated to the public
                  domain, or of any adverse determination or development
                  (including, without limitation, the institution of, or any
                  such determination or development in, any proceeding in the
                  United States Patent and Trademark Office or any court or
                  tribunal in Canada or in any other country) regarding an
                  Obligor's ownership of any such Patent or Trademark or its
                  right to register the same or to keep, maintain and use the
                  same.

                           (iv)     Whenever an Obligor, either by itself or
                  through an agent, employee, licensee or designee, shall file
                  an application for the registration of any Patent or Trademark
                  with the United States Patent and Trademark Office or any
                  similar office or agency in Canada or in any other country or
                  any political subdivision thereof, such Obligor shall report
                  such filing to the Agent and the Lenders quarterly, together
                  with the officer's certificate delivered pursuant to Section

                  Obligor shall execute and deliver any and all agreements,
                  instruments, documents and papers as the Agent may request to
                  evidence the Agent's and the Lenders' security interest in any
                  Patent or Trademark and the goodwill and General Intangibles
                  of such Obligor relating thereto or represented thereby.

                           (v)      Take all reasonable and necessary steps,
                  including, without limitation, in any proceeding before the
                  United States Patent and Trademark Office, or any similar

                  application, to obtain the relevant registration and to
                  maintain each registration of the Patents and Trademarks,
                  including, without limitation, filing of applications for
                  renewal, affidavits of use and affidavits of incontestability,
                  except to the extent that the

<PAGE>

                  failure to do so could not reasonably be expected to have a
                  Material Adverse Effect.

                           (vi)     Promptly notify the Agent and the Lenders
                  after it learns that any Patent or Trademark included in the
                  Collateral is infringed, misappropriated or diluted by a third
                  party to an extent that could reasonably be expected to have a
                  Material Adverse Effect and promptly sue for infringement,
                  misappropriation or dilution, to seek injunctive relief where
                  appropriate and to recover any and all damages for such
                  infringement, misappropriation or dilution, or take such other
                  actions as it shall reasonably deem appropriate under the
                  circumstances to protect such Patent or Trademark.

                           (vii)    Not make any assignment or agreement in
                  conflict with the security interest in the Patents or
                  Trademarks of any Obligor hereunder.

                  (l)      New Patents, Copyrights and Trademarks. Provide the
         Agent (i) quarterly, together with the officer's certificate delivered
         pursuant to Section 7.1(d) of the Credit Agreement, a listing of all
         applications, if any, for new Copyrights, Patents or Trademarks
         (together with a listing of the issuance of registrations or letters on
         present applications), which new applications and issued registrations
         or letters shall be subject to the terms and conditions hereunder and
         of all license agreements entered into with respect to any Copyright,
         Patent or Trademark, and (ii) promptly, from time to time upon the
         written request of the Agent, (A) with respect to Copyrights, a duly
         executed Notice of Grant of Security Interest in Copyrights, (B) with
         respect to Patents, a duly executed Notice of Grant of Security
         Interest in Patents, (C) with respect to Trademarks, a duly executed
         Notice of Grant of Security Interest in Trademarks or (D) such other
         duly executed documents as the Agent may reasonably request in a form
         reasonably acceptable to the Agent and suitable for recording to
         evidence the security interest in the Copyright, Patent or Trademark
         which is the subject of such new application.

                  (m)      Commercial Tort Claims; Notice of Litigation. (i)
         Quarterly, together with the officer's certificate delivered pursuant
         to Section 7.1(d) of the Credit Agreement, forward to the Agent written
         notification of any and all Commercial Tort Claims of the Obligors in
         which an Obligor is the claimant, including, but not limited to, any
         and all actions, suits, and proceedings before any court or
         Governmental Authority by or affecting such Obligor or any of its
         Subsidiaries and (ii) execute and deliver such statements, documents
         and notices and do and cause to be done all such things as may be
         required by the Agent, or required by law, including all things which
         may from time to time be necessary under the UCC (or equivalent local
         law) to fully create, preserve, perfect and protect the priority of the
         Agent's security interest in any such Commercial Tort Claims.

                  (n)      Bank Accounts. At all times, maintain the U.S.
         Lockbox Accounts, the Wachovia Clearing Account and the Wachovia
         Account and any replacement or successor accounts relating thereto in
         accordance with the terms of the Lockbox

                                       14

<PAGE>

         Agreements and the Credit Agreement, as applicable, and in accordance
         with the terms of the applicable Lockbox Agreement and the Credit
         Agreement, cause all amounts received in the U.S. Lockboxes relating
         thereto to be deposited into the applicable U.S. Lockbox Account, the
         Wachovia Clearing Account or the Wachovia Account, as the case may be,
         and to be applied as set forth in the applicable Lockbox Agreement and
         the Credit Agreement, as appropriate. All amounts on deposit in the
         U.S. Lockbox Accounts, the Wachovia Clearing Account and the Wachovia
         Account and any replacement or successor accounts relating thereto
         shall be subject to the Lien of the Agent hereunder.

                  (o)      Insurance. Insure, repair and replace the Collateral
         of such Obligor as set forth in the Credit Agreement and herein. All
         insurance proceeds shall be subject to the security interest of the
         Agent hereunder.

                  (p)      Covenants Relating to the Material Contracts.

                           (i)      Upon the reasonable request of the Agent,
                  each Obligor shall, at its expense, (A) furnish to the Agent
                  copies of all material notices, requests and other documents
                  received by such Obligor under or pursuant to the Material
                  Contracts, and such other information and reports regarding
                  the Material Contracts and (B) make to any other party to any
                  Material Contracts such demands and requests for information
                  and reports or for action as an Obligor is entitled to make
                  thereunder and as may be reasonably related to obtaining the
                  principal benefits of such Material Contract.

                           (ii)     Subject to the provisions of Section 9.13 of
                  the Credit Agreement, unless the applicable Obligor believes
                  it is necessary or advisable in the prudent conduct of its
                  business, no Obligor shall (A) cancel or terminate any
                  Material Contracts of such Obligor or consent to or accept any
                  cancellation or termination thereof; (B) amend or otherwise
                  modify any Material Contracts of such Obligor or give any
                  consent, waiver or approval thereunder; (C) waive any default
                  under or breach of any Material Contracts of such Obligor; or
                  (D) take any other action in connection with any Material
                  Contracts of such Obligor which would impair the value of the
                  interest or rights of such Obligor thereunder or which would
                  impair the interests or rights of the Agent.

                  (q)      New Material Contracts. Whenever an Obligor shall
         enter into a Material Contract, such Obligor shall, as soon as
         available or practicable and in any event no later than quarterly,
         together with the officer's certificate delivered pursuant to Section
         7.1(d) of the Credit Agreement, provide the Agent with a true and
         complete copy of such Material Contract and such other related
         documents as the Agent may reasonably request in a form acceptable to
         the Agent and, if reasonably requested by the Agent, execute and
         deliver (or use commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be executed
         and delivered) to the Agent a collateral assignment of such Material
         Contract and a consent to such collateral assignment, in each case in a
         form acceptable to the Agent. Upon the reasonable request of the Agent,
         an Obligor will do any act, or execute any additional

                                       15

<PAGE>

         documents required by the Agent to ensure to the Agent the
         effectiveness and first priority of its security interest in such
         Material Contract.

         6.       Special Provisions Regarding Inventory.

                  (a)      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
         this Security Agreement, each Obligor may, unless and until an Event of
         Default occurs and is continuing and the Agent instructs such Obligor
         otherwise, without further consent or approval of the Agent, use,
         consume, sell, lease and exchange its Inventory in the ordinary course
         of its business as presently conducted, whereupon, in the case of such
         a sale or exchange, the security interest created hereby in the
         Inventory so sold or exchanged (but not in any Proceeds arising from
         such sale or exchange) shall cease immediately without any further
         action on the part of the Agent.

                  (b)      Upon the Lenders' making any Loan pursuant to the
         Credit Agreement, the Issuing Bank issuing any Letter of Credit or any
         Canadian Lender creating a Bankers' Acceptance pursuant to the Credit
         Agreement, each Obligor shall be deemed to have warranted that all
         warranties of such Obligor set forth in this Security Agreement with
         respect to its Inventory are true and correct in all material respects
         with respect to such Inventory, including without limitation that such
         Inventory is located at a location set forth on Schedule 6.22 to the
         Credit Agreement, as the same may be updated from time to time pursuant
         to Section 7.21 of the Credit Agreement.

         7.       Special Provisions Regarding Insurance Account.

                  (a)      Promptly upon and at all times after the receipt of
         any cash proceeds of a Casualty Loss required to be paid to the Agent
         pursuant to Section 7.6 of the Credit Agreement (the "Insurance
         Proceeds"), the Company shall establish and shall thereafter maintain
         an additional cash collateral account (the "Insurance Account") at the
         offices of the Agent or such other bank as the Company and the Agent
         may agree (the "Insurance Account Bank"), under the dominion and
         control of the Agent. Forthwith upon such establishment, the Company
         shall notify the Agent of the location, account name and account number
         of such account. The Company hereby agrees to cause any Insurance
         Proceeds received from time to time after the establishment of the
         Insurance Account to be deposited therein as set forth in this
         paragraph. Any income received with respect to the balance from time to
         time standing to the credit of the Insurance Account, including any
         interest or capital gains on investments therein, shall remain, or be
         deposited, in the Insurance Account. All right, title and interest in
         and to the cash amounts on deposit from time to time in the Insurance
         Account together with any investments from time to time made pursuant
         to clause (c) of this Section shall constitute part of the Collateral
         hereunder and shall not constitute payment of the Secured Obligations
         until applied thereto as hereinafter provided.

                  (b)      The balance from time to time standing to the credit
         of the Insurance Account shall be subject to withdrawal only upon the
         instructions of the Agent. Except

                                       16

<PAGE>

         upon the occurrence and continuation of an Event of Default or with
         respect to amounts attributable to proceeds deposited in the Insurance
         Account which the Agent has elected to apply to repay the Loans in
         accordance with Section 7.6(c) of the Credit Agreement, the Agent
         agrees to give instructions to distribute amounts standing to the
         credit of the Insurance Account to the Company at such times and in
         such amounts as the Company shall request for the purpose of repairing,
         reconstructing or replacing the property in respect of which such
         Insurance Proceeds were received. Any such request shall be accompanied
         by a certificate of a Senior Financial Officer of the Company setting
         forth in detail reasonably satisfactory to the Agent the repair,
         reconstruction or replacement for which such funds will be expended. If
         immediately available cash on deposit in the Insurance Account is not
         sufficient to make any distribution to the Company referred to in the
         previous sentence of this Section 7(b), the Agent shall cause to be
         liquidated as promptly as practicable such investments in the Insurance
         Account designated by the Company as required to obtain sufficient cash
         to make such distribution and, notwithstanding any other provision of
         this Section 7, such distribution shall not be made until such
         liquidation has taken place. Upon the occurrence and continuation of an
         Event of Default, the Agent may apply (subject to collection) any or
         all of the balance from time to time standing to the credit of the
         Insurance Account in the manner specified in Section 4.7 of the Credit
         Agreement.

                  (c)      Amounts on deposit in the Insurance Account shall be
         invested and re-invested from time to time in such Cash Equivalents as
         the Company shall determine, which Cash Equivalents shall be held under
         the dominion and control of the Agent; provided that, if an Event of
         Default has occurred and is continuing, the Agent may cause such Cash
         Equivalents to be liquidated and apply or cause to be applied the
         proceeds thereof to the payment of the Secured Obligations in the
         manner specified in Section 4.7 of the Credit Agreement.

         8.       Performance of Obligations; Advances by Agent. On failure of
any Obligor to perform any of the covenants and agreements contained herein, the
Agent may, at its sole option and in its sole discretion, perform or cause to be
performed the same and in so doing may expend such sums as the Agent may
reasonably deem advisable in the performance thereof, including, without
limitation, the payment of any insurance premiums, the payment of any taxes, a
payment to obtain a release of a Lien or potential Lien (other than a Permitted
Lien), expenditures made in defending against any adverse claim and all other
expenditures which the Agent may make for the protection of the security
interest hereof or may be compelled to make by operation of law. All such sums
and amounts so expended shall be repayable by the Obligors on a joint and
several basis promptly upon timely notice thereof and demand therefor, shall
constitute additional Secured Obligations and shall bear interest from the date
said amounts are expended at the default rate set forth in Section 4.2(b) of the
Credit Agreement. No such performance of any covenant or agreement by the Agent
on behalf of any Obligor, and no such advance or expenditure therefor, shall
relieve the Obligors of any default under the terms of this Security Agreement,
the other Credit Documents or any Lender Hedging Agreement. The Agent may make
any payment hereby authorized in accordance with any bill, statement or estimate
procured from the appropriate public office or holder of the claim to be
discharged without inquiry into the

                                       17

<PAGE>

accuracy of such bill, statement or estimate or into the validity of any tax
assessment, sale, forfeiture, tax lien, title or claim except to the extent such
payment is being contested in good faith by an Obligor in appropriate
proceedings and against which adequate reserves are being maintained in
accordance with U.S. GAAP.

         9.       Events of Default.

         The occurrence of an event which under the Credit Agreement would
constitute an Event of Default shall be an event of default hereunder (an "Event
of Default").

         10.      Remedies.

                  (a)      General Remedies. Upon the occurrence and during the
         continuance of an Event of Default, the Lenders shall have, in addition
         to the rights and remedies provided herein, in the Credit Documents, in
         any Lender Hedging Agreement or by law (including, but not limited to,
         levy of attachment, garnishment and the rights and remedies set forth
         in the Uniform Commercial Code (or equivalent local law) of the
         jurisdiction applicable to the affected Collateral), the rights and
         remedies of a secured party under the UCC (regardless of whether the
         UCC is the law of the jurisdiction where the rights and remedies are
         asserted and regardless of whether the UCC applies to the affected
         Collateral), and further, the Agent may, with or without judicial
         process or the aid and assistance of others, (i) enter on any premises
         on which any of the Collateral may be located and, without resistance
         or interference by the Obligors, take possession of the Collateral,
         (ii) dispose of any Collateral on any such premises, (iii) require the
         Obligors to assemble and make available to the Agent at the expense of
         the Obligors any Collateral at any place and time designated by the
         Agent which is reasonably convenient to both parties, (iv) remove any
         Collateral from any such premises for the purpose of effecting sale or
         other disposition thereof, and/or (v) without demand and without
         advertisement, notice, hearing or process of law, all of which each of
         the Obligors hereby waives to the fullest extent permitted by law, at
         any place and time or times, sell and deliver any or all Collateral
         held by or for it at public or private sale, by one or more contracts,
         in one or more parcels, for cash, upon credit or otherwise, at such
         prices and upon such terms as the Agent deems advisable, in its sole
         discretion. Neither the Agent's compliance with any applicable state or
         federal law in the conduct of such sale, nor its disclaimer of any
         warranties relating to the Collateral, shall be considered to adversely
         affect the commercial reasonableness of such sale. In addition to all
         other sums due the Agent and the Lenders with respect to the Secured
         Obligations, the Obligors shall pay the Agent and each of the Lenders
         all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the Agent or any such
         Lender, including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys' fees and
         court costs, in obtaining or liquidating the Collateral, in enforcing
         payment of the Secured Obligations, or in the prosecution or defense of
         any action or proceeding by or against the Agent or the Lenders or the
         Obligors concerning any matter arising out of or connected with this
         Security Agreement, any Collateral or the Secured Obligations,
         including, without limitation, any of the foregoing arising in, arising
         under or related to a case under any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar
         law. To the extent the rights of notice cannot be legally waived

                                       18

<PAGE>

         hereunder, each Obligor agrees that any requirement of reasonable
         notice shall be met if such notice is personally served on or mailed,
         postage prepaid, to the Company in accordance with the notice
         provisions of Section 14.1 of the Credit Agreement at least ten (10)
         days before the time of sale or other event giving rise to the
         requirement of such notice. The Agent and the Lenders shall not be
         obligated to make any sale or other disposition of the Collateral
         regardless of notice having been given. To the extent permitted by law,
         the Agent and any Lender may be a purchaser at any such sale. To the
         extent permitted by applicable law, each of the Obligors hereby waives
         all of its rights of redemption with respect to any such sale. Subject
         to the provisions of applicable law, the Agent and the Lenders may
         postpone or cause the postponement of the sale of all or any portion of
         the Collateral by announcement at the time and place of such sale, and
         such sale may, without further notice, to the extent permitted by law,
         be made at the time and place to which the sale was postponed, or the
         Agent and the Lenders may further postpone such sale by announcement
         made at such time and place. Upon the occurrence and during the
         continuance of an Event of Default, the Company shall endorse over and
         deliver to the Agent any checks that it receives in its capacity as
         sublessor of any real property and shall not first deposit the funds
         evidenced thereby into an account of the Company or otherwise commingle
         such funds with its own.

                  (b)      Remedies Relating to Accounts. Upon the occurrence
         and during the continuance of an Event of Default, whether or not the
         Agent has exercised any or all of its rights and remedies hereunder,
         the Agent shall have the right to enforce any Obligor's rights against
         any account debtors and obligors on such Obligor's Accounts. Each
         Obligor acknowledges and agrees that the Proceeds of its Accounts
         remitted to or on behalf of the Agent in accordance with the provisions
         hereof shall be solely for the Agent's own convenience and that such
         Obligor shall not have any right, title or interest in such Proceeds or
         in any such other amounts except as expressly provided herein. The
         Agent and the Lenders shall have no liability or responsibility to any
         Obligor for acceptance of a check, draft or other order for payment of
         money bearing the legend "payment in full" or words of similar import
         or any other restrictive legend or endorsement or be responsible for
         determining the correctness of any remittance. The Agent shall have no
         obligation to apply or give credit for any item included in proceeds of
         Accounts or other Collateral until the applicable Lockbox Bank has
         received final payment therefor at its offices in cash. However, if the
         Agent does permit credit to be given for any item prior to a Lockbox
         Bank receiving final payment therefor and such Lockbox Bank fails to
         receive such final payment or an item is charged back to the Agent or
         any Lockbox Bank for any reason, the Agent may at its election in
         either instance charge the amount of such item back against any such
         U.S. Lockbox Accounts, together with interest thereon at a rate per
         annum equal to the default rate set forth in Section 4.2(b) of the
         Credit Agreement. Each Obligor hereby agrees to indemnify the Agent and
         the Lenders from and against all liabilities, damages, losses, actions,
         claims, judgments, costs, expenses, charges and reasonable attorneys'
         fees suffered or incurred by the Agent or the Lenders (each, an
         "Indemnified Party") because of the maintenance of the foregoing
         arrangements except as relating to or arising out of the gross
         negligence or willful misconduct of an Indemnified Party or its
         officers, employees or agents. In the

                                       19

<PAGE>

         case of any investigation, litigation or other proceeding, the
         foregoing indemnity shall be effective whether or not such
         investigation, litigation or proceeding is brought by an Obligor, its
         directors, shareholders or creditors or an Indemnified Party or any
         other Person or any other Indemnified Party is otherwise a party
         thereto. The Agent shall have no liability or responsibility to any
         Obligor for a Lockbox Bank accepting any check, draft or other order
         for payment of money bearing the legend "payment in full" or words of
         similar import or any other restrictive legend or endorsement
         whatsoever or be responsible for determining the correctness of any
         remittance (it being understood that this sentence shall in no way
         affect the liability or responsibility of any such Lockbox Bank).

                  (c)      Access. In addition to the rights and remedies
         hereunder, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event
         of Default, the Agent shall have the right to enter and remain upon the
         various premises of the Obligors without cost or charge to the Agent,
         and use the same, together with materials, supplies, books and records
         of the Obligors for the purpose of collecting and liquidating the
         Collateral, or for preparing for sale and conducting the sale of the
         Collateral, whether by foreclosure, auction or otherwise. In addition,
         the Agent may remove Collateral, or any part thereof, from such
         premises and/or any records with respect thereto, in order to
         effectively collect or liquidate such Collateral. If the Agent
         exercises its right to take possession of the Collateral, each Obligor
         shall also at its expense perform any and all other steps reasonably
         requested by the Agent to preserve and protect the security interest
         hereby granted in the Collateral, such as placing and maintaining signs
         indicating the security interest of the Agent, appointing overseers for
         the Collateral and maintaining inventory records.

                  (d)      Nonexclusive Nature of Remedies. Failure by the Agent
         or the Lenders to exercise any right, remedy or option under this
         Security Agreement, any other Credit Document, any Lender Hedging
         Agreement or as provided by law, or any delay by the Agent or the
         Lenders in exercising the same, shall not operate as a waiver of any
         such right, remedy or option. No waiver hereunder shall be effective
         unless it is in writing, signed by the party against whom such waiver
         is sought to be enforced and then only to the extent specifically
         stated, which in the case of the Agent or the Lenders shall only be
         granted as provided herein. To the extent permitted by law, neither the
         Agent, the Lenders, nor any party acting as attorney for the Agent or
         the Lenders, shall be liable hereunder for any acts or omissions or for
         any error of judgment or mistake of fact or law other than their gross
         negligence or willful misconduct hereunder. The rights and remedies of
         the Agent and the Lenders under this Security Agreement shall be
         cumulative and not exclusive of any other right or remedy which the
         Agent or the Lenders may have.

                  (e)      Retention of Collateral. In addition to the rights
         and remedies hereunder, upon the occurrence and during the continuance
         of an Event of Default, the Agent may, after providing the notices and
         obtaining the consents required by Section 9-620 of the UCC or
         otherwise complying with the requirements of applicable law of the
         relevant jurisdiction, accept or retain the Collateral in satisfaction
         of the Secured Obligations. Unless and until the Agent shall have
         provided such notices, however, the Agent shall not be deemed to have
         retained any Collateral in satisfaction of any Secured Obligations for
         any reason.

                  (f)      Deficiency. In the event that the proceeds of any
         sale, collection or realization are insufficient to pay all amounts to
         which the Agent and the Lenders are legally entitled, the Obligors
         shall be jointly and severally liable for the deficiency, together with
         interest thereon at the default rate set forth in Section 4.2(b) of the
         Credit Agreement, together with the costs of collection and the
         reasonable fees of any attorneys employed by the Agent to collect such
         deficiency. Any surplus remaining after the full payment and
         satisfaction of the Secured Obligations shall be returned to the
         Obligors or to whomsoever a court of competent jurisdiction shall
         determine to be entitled thereto.

                  (g)      Other Security. To the extent that any of the Secured
         Obligations are now or hereafter secured by property other than the
         Collateral (including, without limitation, real and other personal
         property owned by an Obligor), or by a guarantee, endorsement or
         property of any other Person, then the Agent and the Lenders shall have
         the right to proceed against such other property, guarantee or
         endorsement upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event
         of Default, and the Agent and the Lenders have the right, in their sole
         discretion, to determine which rights, security, liens, security
         interests or remedies the Agent and the Lenders shall at any time
         pursue, relinquish, subordinate, modify or take with respect thereto,
         without in any way modifying or affecting any of them or any of the
         Agent's and the Lenders' rights or the Secured Obligations under this
         Security Agreement, under any other of the Credit Documents or under
         any Lender Hedging Agreement.

                  (h)      PPSA. In addition to, and not in any way in
         limitation of any of the foregoing rights and remedies, the Agent may
         exercise any and all remedies available to the Agent under the PPSA.

         11.      Rights of the Agent.

                  (a)      Power of Attorney. In addition to other powers of
         attorney contained herein, each Obligor hereby designates and appoints
         the Agent, on behalf of the Lenders, and each of its designees or
         agents, as attorney-in-fact of such Obligor, irrevocably and with power
         of substitution, with authority to take any or all of the following
         actions upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of
         Default:

                           (i)      to demand, collect, settle, compromise,
                  adjust, give discharges and releases, all as the Agent may
                  reasonably determine;

                                       21

<PAGE>

                           (ii)     to commence and prosecute any actions at any
                  court for the purposes of collecting any Collateral and
                  enforcing any other right in respect thereof;

                           (iii)    to defend, settle, adjust or compromise any
                  action, suit or proceeding brought and, in connection
                  therewith, give such discharge or release as the Agent may
                  deem reasonably appropriate;

                           (iv)     to receive, open and dispose of mail
                  addressed to an Obligor and endorse checks, notes, drafts,
                  acceptances, money orders, bills of lading, warehouse receipts
                  or other instruments or documents evidencing payment, shipment
                  or storage of the goods giving rise to the Collateral of such
                  Obligor, or securing or relating to such Collateral, on behalf
                  of and in the name of such Obligor;

                           (v)      to sell, assign, transfer, make any
                  agreement in respect of, or otherwise deal with or exercise
                  rights in respect of, any Collateral or the goods or services
                  which have given rise thereto, as fully and completely as
                  though the Agent were the absolute owner thereof for all
                  purposes;

                           (vi)     to adjust and settle claims under any
                  insurance policy relating thereto;

                           (vii)    to execute and deliver all assignments,
                  conveyances, statements, financing statements, renewal
                  financing statements, security agreements, affidavits, notices
                  and other agreements, instruments and documents that the Agent
                  may determine necessary in order to perfect and maintain the
                  security interests and liens granted in this Security
                  Agreement and in order to fully consummate all of the
                  transactions contemplated herein;

                           (viii)   to institute any foreclosure proceedings
                  that the Agent may deem appropriate; and

                           (ix)     to do and perform all such other acts and
                  things as the Agent may reasonably deem to be necessary,
                  proper or convenient in connection with the Collateral.

         This power of attorney is a power coupled with an interest and shall be
         irrevocable (i) for so long as any of the Secured Obligations remain
         outstanding, any Credit Document or any Lender Hedging Agreement is in
         effect or any Letter of Credit shall remain outstanding and (ii) until
         all of the Commitments shall have been terminated. The Agent shall be
         under no duty to exercise or withhold the exercise of any of the
         rights, powers, privileges and options expressly or implicitly granted
         to the Agent in this Security

                                       22

<PAGE>

         Agreement, and shall not be liable for any failure to do so or any
         delay in doing so. The Agent shall not be liable for any act or
         omission or for any error of judgment or any mistake of fact or law in
         its individual capacity or its capacity as attorney-in-fact except acts
         or omissions resulting from its gross negligence or willful misconduct.
         This power of attorney is conferred on the Agent solely to protect,
         preserve and realize upon its security interest in the Collateral.

                  (b)      Assignment by the Administrative Agent. The
         Administrative Agent may from time to time assign the Secured
         Obligations and the Collateral to a successor Administrative Agent
         appointed pursuant to Section 13.9 of the Credit Agreement, and such
         successor shall be entitled to all of the rights and remedies of the
         Administrative Agent under this Security Agreement in relation thereto.

                  (c)      The Agent's Duty of Care. Other than the exercise of
         reasonable care to assure the safe custody of the Collateral while
         being held by the Agent hereunder, the Agent shall have no duty or
         liability to preserve rights pertaining thereto, it being understood
         and agreed that the Obligors shall be responsible for preservation of
         all rights in the Collateral, and the Agent shall be relieved of all
         responsibility for the Collateral upon surrendering it or tendering the
         surrender of it to the Obligors. The Agent shall be deemed to have
         exercised reasonable care in the custody and preservation of the
         Collateral in its possession if the Collateral is accorded treatment
         substantially equal to that which the Agent accords its own property,
         which shall be no less than the treatment employed by a reasonable and
         prudent agent in the industry, it being understood that the Agent shall
         not have responsibility for taking any necessary steps to preserve
         rights against any parties with respect to any of the Collateral. In
         the event of a public or private sale of Collateral pursuant to Section
         10 hereof, the Agent shall have no obligation to clean-up, repair or
         otherwise prepare the Collateral for sale.

         12.      Application of Proceeds. Any amounts on deposit in the U.S.
Lockbox Accounts, the Wachovia Clearing Accounts and the Wachovia Account and
any replacement or successor accounts relating thereto, as applicable, shall be
applied by the Agent in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement and
the Lockbox Agreement relating thereto. Upon the occurrence and during the
continuation of an Event of Default, any payments in respect of the Secured
Obligations and any proceeds of the Collateral, when received by the Agent or
any of the Lenders in cash or its equivalent, will be applied in reduction of
the Secured Obligations in the order set forth in Section 4.7 of the Credit
Agreement, and each Obligor irrevocably waives the right to direct the
application of such payments and proceeds and acknowledges and agrees that the
Agent shall have the continuing and exclusive right to apply and reapply any and
all such payments and proceeds in the Agent's sole discretion, notwithstanding
any entry to the contrary upon any of its books and records.

         13.      Costs of Counsel. If at any time hereafter, whether upon the
occurrence of an Event of Default or not, the Agent employs counsel to prepare
or consider amendments, waivers or consents with respect to this Security
Agreement, or to take action or make a response in or with respect to any legal
or arbitral proceeding relating to this Security Agreement or relating to the

                                       23

<PAGE>

Collateral, or to protect the Collateral or exercise any rights or remedies
under this Security Agreement or with respect to the Collateral, then the
Obligors agree to promptly pay upon demand any and all such reasonable costs and
expenses of the Agent, all of which costs and expenses shall constitute Secured
Obligations hereunder.

         14.      Continuing Agreement.

                  (a)      This Security Agreement shall be a continuing
         agreement in every respect and shall remain in full force and effect so
         long as any of the Secured Obligations remain outstanding or any Credit
         Document or Lender Hedging Agreement is in effect or any Letter of
         Credit shall remain outstanding and until all of the Commitments
         thereunder shall have terminated. Upon such payment and termination,
         this Security Agreement shall be automatically terminated and the
         Agent, upon the request and at the expense of the Obligors, forthwith
         release all of their liens and security interests hereunder and shall
         execute, if necessary, and deliver all UCC termination statements
         and/or other documents reasonably requested by the Obligors evidencing
         such termination. Notwithstanding the foregoing all releases and
         indemnities provided hereunder shall survive termination of this
         Security Agreement.

                  (b)      This Security Agreement shall continue to be
         effective or be automatically reinstated, as the case may be, if at any
         time payment, in whole or in part, of any of the Secured Obligations is
         rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned by the Agent or any
         Lender as a preference, fraudulent conveyance or otherwise under any
         bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law, all as though such payment had
         not been made; provided that in the event payment of all or any part of
         the Secured Obligations is rescinded or must be restored or returned,
         all reasonable costs and expenses (including without limitation any
         reasonable legal fees and disbursements) incurred by the Agent or any
         Lender in defending and enforcing such reinstatement shall be deemed to
         be included as a part of the Secured Obligations.

         15.      Amendments; Waivers; Modifications. This Security Agreement
and the provisions hereof may not be amended, waived, modified, changed,
discharged or terminated except as set forth in Section 14.6 of the Credit
Agreement.

         16.      Successors in Interest. This Security Agreement shall create a
continuing security interest in the Collateral and shall be binding upon each
Obligor, its successors and assigns and shall inure, together with the rights
and remedies of the Agent and the Lenders hereunder, to the benefit of the Agent
and the Lenders and their successors and permitted assigns; provided, however,
that none of the Obligors may assign its rights or delegate its duties hereunder
without the prior written consent of each Lender or the Required Lenders, as
required by the Credit Agreement. To the fullest extent permitted by law, each
Obligor hereby releases the Agent and each Lender, each of their respective
officers, employees and agents and each of their respective successors and
assigns, from any liability for any act or omission relating to this Security
Agreement or the Collateral, except for any liability arising from the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of the Agent or such Lender or their respective
officers, employees and agents.

                                       24

<PAGE>

         17.      Notices. All notices required or permitted to be given under
this Security Agreement shall be in conformance with Section 14.1 of the Credit
Agreement.

         18.      Counterparts. This Security Agreement may be executed in any
number of counterparts, each of which where so executed and delivered shall be
an original, but all of which shall constitute one and the same instrument. It
shall not be necessary in making proof of this Security Agreement to produce or
account for more than one such counterpart.

         19.      Headings. The headings of the sections and subsections hereof
are provided for convenience only and shall not in any way affect the meaning,
construction or interpretation of any provision of this Security Agreement.

         20.      Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction and Service of
Process; Waiver of Jury Trial. THIS SECURITY AGREEMENT AND THE RIGHTS AND
OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES HEREUNDER SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED AND
INTERPRETED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK. The terms of
Sections 14.12 and 14.14 of the Credit Agreement are incorporated herein by
reference, mutatis mutandis, and the parties hereto agree to such terms.

         21.      Severability. If any provision of any of the Security
Agreement is determined to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, such provision
shall be fully severable and the remaining provisions shall remain in full force
and effect and shall be construed without giving effect to the illegal, invalid
or unenforceable provisions.

         22.      Entirety. This Security Agreement, the other Credit Documents
and any Lender Hedging Agreement represent the entire agreement of the parties
hereto and thereto, and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, oral
or written, if any, including any commitment letters or correspondence relating
to the Credit Documents, any such Lender Hedging Agreement or the transactions
contemplated herein and therein.

         23.      Survival. All representations and warranties of the Obligors
hereunder shall survive the execution and delivery of this Security Agreement,
the other Credit Documents and the Lender Hedging Agreements, the delivery of
the Notes and the making of the Loans, the issuance of the Letters of Credit and
the creation of Bankers' Acceptances under the Credit Agreement.

         24.      Joint and Several Obligations of Obligors.

                  (a)      Each of the Obligors is accepting joint and several
         liability hereunder in consideration of the financial accommodation to
         be provided by the Lenders under the Credit Agreement, for the mutual
         benefit, direct and indirect, of each of the Obligors and in
         consideration of the undertakings of each of the Obligors to accept
         joint and several liability for the obligations of each of them.

                                       25

<PAGE>

                  (b)      Each of the Obligors, jointly and severally, hereby
         irrevocably and unconditionally accepts, not merely as a surety but
         also as a co-debtor, joint and several liability with the other
         Obligors with respect to the payment and performance of all of the
         Secured Obligations arising under this Security Agreement, the other
         Credit Documents and any Lender Hedging Agreement, it being the
         intention of the parties hereto that all the Secured Obligations shall
         be the joint and several obligations of each of the Obligors without
         preferences or distinction among them.

                  (c)      Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary
         contained herein or in any other of the Credit Documents, to the extent
         the obligations of an Obligor shall be adjudicated to be invalid or
         unenforceable for any reason (including, without limitation, because of
         any applicable state, provincial or federal law relating to fraudulent
         conveyances or transfers) then the obligations of such Obligor
         hereunder shall be limited to the maximum amount that is permissible
         under applicable law (whether state, provincial or federal or and
         including, without limitation, the Bankruptcy Code).

         25.      Rights of Required Lenders. All rights of the Agent hereunder,
if not exercised by the Agent, may be exercised by the Required Lenders.

         26.      Judgment Currency.

                  (a)      If for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any
         court it is necessary to convert all or any part of the Secured
         Obligations or any other amount due to the Lenders hereunder or under
         other Credit Document in respect of the Obligors' obligations hereunder
         in any currency (the "Original Currency") into another currency (the
         "Other Currency") each Obligor to the fullest extent that it may
         effectively do so, agrees that the rate of exchange used shall be that
         at which, in accordance with normal banking procedures, the Agent could
         purchase the Original Currency with the Other Currency at its principal
         offices in Charlotte, North Carolina on the Business Day on which the
         Agent is open for the transaction of its banking business at such
         offices immediately preceding the day on which any such judgment, or
         any relevant part thereof, is paid or otherwise satisfied.

                  (b)      The obligation of each Obligor in respect of any sum
         due in the Original Currency from it to the Agent or the Lenders
         hereunder or under any other Credit Document in respect of the
         Obligors' obligation hereunder shall, notwithstanding any judgment in
         any Other Currency, be discharged only to the extent that on the
         Business Day following receipt by the Agent of any sum adjudged to be
         so due in such Other Currency or of any other sum in any Other Currency
         the Agent may, in accordance with its normal banking procedures,
         purchase the Original Currency with such Other Currency. If the amount
         of the Original Currency so purchased is less than the sum originally
         due to the Agent and the Lenders in the Original Currency, the Obligors
         shall, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment,
         indemnify the Agent against such loss, and if the amount of the
         Original Currency so purchased exceeds the sum originally due to the
         Lenders, the Agent shall remit such excess to the Obligors.
