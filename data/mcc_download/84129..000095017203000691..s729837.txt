Ladies and Gentlemen:

            Rite Aid Corporation, a corporation organized under the laws of
Delaware (the "Company"), proposes to issue and sell to the several parties
named in Schedule I hereto (the "Initial Purchasers"), for whom you (the
"Representatives") are acting as representatives, $300,000,000 principal
amount of its 9 1/2% Senior Secured Notes Due 2011 (including the guarantees
thereof described herein, the "Securities"). The Securities are to be issued
under an indenture (the "Indenture"), to be dated as of February 12, 2003,
between the Company, the subsidiary guarantors party thereto (the "Subsidiary
Guarantors") and BNY Midwest Trust Company, as trustee (the "Trustee"). The
Securities have the benefit of a Registration Rights Agreement (the
"Registration Rights Agreement"), to be dated February 12, 2003, among the
Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors and the Initial Purchasers, pursuant to
which the Company and such Subsidiary Guarantors have agreed to file with the
Commission (i) a registration statement under the Securities Act registering
an issue of senior secured notes of the Company (including the guarantees
thereof described herein, the "Exchange Notes"), which are identical in all
material respects to the Securities (except that the Exchange Notes will not
contain terms with respect to transfer restrictions) and (ii) under certain
circumstances, a shelf registration statement pursuant to Rule 415 under the
Securities Act. To the extent there are no additional parties listed on
Schedule I other than you, the term Representatives as used herein shall mean
you as the Initial Purchasers, and the terms Representatives and Initial
Purchasers shall mean either the singular or plural as the context requires.
The use of the neuter in this Agreement shall include the feminine and
masculine wherever appropriate. Certain terms used herein are defined in
Section 17 hereof. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have
the meanings given to such terms in the Final Memorandum (as defined below).

            The sale of the Securities to the Initial Purchasers will be made
without registration of the Securities under the Securities Act in reliance
upon exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act.

                                      1
<PAGE>

            In connection with the sale of the Securities, the Company has
prepared a preliminary offering memorandum, dated February 3, 2003 (as amended
or supplemented at the Execution Time, including any and all exhibits thereto
and any information incorporated by reference therein, the "Preliminary
Memorandum"), and a final offering memorandum, dated February 5, 2003 (as
amended or supplemented at the Execution Time, including any and all exhibits
thereto and any information incorporated by reference therein, the "Final
Memorandum"). Each of the Preliminary Memorandum and the Final Memorandum sets
forth certain information concerning the Company and the Securities. The
Company hereby confirms that it has authorized the use of the Preliminary
Memorandum and the Final Memorandum, and any amendment or supplement thereto,
in connection with the offer and sale of the Securities by the Initial
Purchasers.

            The Subsidiary Guarantors shall provide a subordinated guarantee
of the obligations under the Securities and shall grant to the holders of the
Securities a shared second priority lien, subject to permitted liens, on the
Collateral pursuant to the guarantee agreements, security agreements,
mortgages, intercreditor agreements and other similar agreements listed on
Schedule II hereto (collectively, the "Security Documents").

            For purposes of this Agreement, all references to Subsidiary
Guarantors shall mean those entities set forth on Schedule III hereto plus any
other Subsidiary Guarantor that becomes a party to this Agreement pursuant to
Sections 5(o) hereof; provided, however, that any such Subsidiary Guarantor
shall cease to be a Subsidiary Guarantor under this Agreement and the
Registration Rights Agreement at such time as such entity ceases to be a
Subsidiary Guarantor under the Security Documents.

               1. Representations and Warranties. The Company and each of the
    Subsidiary Guarantors jointly and severally represent and warrant to each
    Initial Purchaser as set forth below in this Section 1.

                  (a) The Preliminary Memorandum, at the date thereof, did not
          contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
          material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
          the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. At the
          Execution Time and on the Closing Date (as defined in Section 3
          hereof), the Final Memorandum did not, and will not (and any
          amendment or supplement thereto, at the date thereof and at the
          Closing Date, will not), contain any untrue statement of a material
          fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
          statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
          were made, not misleading; provided, however, that the Company and
          the Subsidiary Guarantors make no representation or warranty as to
          the information contained in or omitted from the Preliminary
          Memorandum or the Final Memorandum, or any amendment or supplement
          thereto, in reliance upon and in conformity with information
          furnished in writing to the Company by or on behalf of the Initial
          Purchasers through any of the Representatives specifically for
          inclusion therein.

                  (b) Neither the Company, nor any of its Affiliates, nor any
          person acting on its or their behalf (other than the Initial
          Purchasers or anyone acting on their behalf, as to whom the Company
          makes no representation) has, directly or indirectly, made offers or
          sales of


                                      2
<PAGE>

          any security, or solicited offers to buy any security, under
          circumstances that would require the registration of the Securities
          under the Securities Act.

                  (c) Neither the Company, nor any of its Affiliates, nor any
          person acting on its or their behalf (other than the Initial
          Purchasers or anyone acting on their behalf, as to whom the Company
          makes no representation) has engaged in any form of general
          solicitation or general advertising (within the meaning of
          Regulation D) in connection with any offer or sale of the Securities
          in the United States.

                  (d) The Securities satisfy the eligibility requirements of
          Rule 144A(d)(3) under the Securities Act.

                  (e) Neither the Company, nor any of its Affiliates, nor any
          person acting on its or their behalf (other than the Initial
          Purchasers or anyone acting on their behalf, as to whom the Company
          makes no representation) has engaged in any directed selling efforts
          with respect to the Securities being sold in reliance on Regulation
          S, and each of them has complied with the offering restrictions
          requirements of Regulation S. Terms used in this paragraph have the
          meanings given to them by Regulation S.

                  (f) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary Guarantor is, and
          after giving effect to the offering and sale of the Securities and
          the application of the proceeds thereof as described in the Final
          Memorandum none of them will be, an "investment company" within the
          meaning of the Investment Company Act.

                  (g) The Company is subject to and in compliance, in all
          material respects, with the reporting requirements of Section 13 or
          Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act.

                  (h) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary Guarantor has
          paid or agreed to pay to any person any compensation for soliciting
          another to purchase any Securities (except as contemplated by this
          Agreement).

                  (i) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary Guarantor has
          taken, directly or indirectly, any action designed to or that would
          constitute or that might reasonably be expected to cause or result
          in, under the Exchange Act or otherwise, the stabilization or
          manipulation of the price of any security of the Company or any
          Subsidiary Guarantor to facilitate the sale or resale of the
          Securities.

                  (j) On the Closing Date, each of the Indenture and the
          Security Documents will conform in all material respects to the
          descriptions thereof contained in the Final Memorandum.

                  (k) On the Closing Date, the obligations of the Subsidiary
          Guarantors under the Subsidiary Guarantees in favor of the holders
          of Securities will be secured by, and upon issuance of the Exchange
          Notes the obligations of the Subsidiary Guarantors under the
          Subsidiary Guarantees in favor of the holders of the Exchange Notes
          will be secured by, valid and enforceable perfected second priority
          liens on the Collateral pursuant to the Security Documents for the
          benefit of holders of the Securities or the Exchange Notes, as the
          case may be (the "Security Interests"), and the Collateral will be
          free and clear of all

                                      3
<PAGE>

          liens, except for the liens on the Collateral created or permitted
          by the Indenture and the Security Documents. The Security Interests
          will be pari passu in all respects with the liens securing the
          Company's 12.5% Notes and Shareholder Notes, to the extent the
          Shareholder Notes have not been redeemed.

                  (l) On the Closing Date, all filings, recordings,
          registrations and other actions necessary or desirable to preserve
          and protect the rights with respect to, and perfect and make valid
          and enforceable, the Security Interests under the Security Documents
          will have been taken and be in full force and effect.

                  (m) Each of the Company and its subsidiaries has been duly
          incorporated, is validly existing as a corporation and, except for
          1525 Cortyou Road-Brooklyn Inc., is in good standing under the laws
          of the jurisdiction in which it is chartered or organized with full
          corporate power and authority to own or lease, as the case may be,
          and to operate its properties and conduct its business as described
          in the Final Memorandum, and is duly qualified to do business as a
          foreign corporation and is in good standing under the laws of each
          jurisdiction which requires such qualification except to the extent
          that failure to be so qualified or be in good standing would not
          reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the
          condition (financial or otherwise), prospects, earnings, business or
          properties of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
          whether or not arising from transactions in the ordinary course of
          business (a "Material Adverse Effect").

                  (n) All the outstanding shares of capital stock of each
          subsidiary have been duly and validly authorized and issued and are
          fully paid and nonassessable, and, except for Rx USA, Inc., Rite Aid
          Lease Management Company, Read's, Inc., Thrifty PayLess Health
          Services, L.L.P. and Rite Aid Risk Management Corp., all outstanding
          shares of capital stock of the subsidiaries of the Company are owned
          by the Company either directly or through wholly owned subsidiaries
          free and clear of any perfected security interest or any other
          security interests, claims, liens or encumbrances.

                  (o) The Company's authorized equity capitalization is as set
          forth in the Final Memorandum.

                  (p) The statements in the Final Memorandum under the
          headings "Certain United States Federal Tax Considerations for
          Non-United States Holders", "Description of Notes", "Exchange Offer;
          Registration Rights", "Business - Regulation" and "Business - Legal
          Proceedings", "Description of Other Indebtedness", "Description of
          Collateral and Intercreditor Arrangements" and "Risk Factors" fairly
          summarize the matters therein described.

                  (q) This Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and
          delivered by the Company and each Subsidiary Guarantor; the Security
          Documents have been duly authorized and each constitute, or when
          executed and delivered by the Company and each Subsidiary Guarantor
          (to the extent stated therein to be a party thereto) will each
          constitute, a legal, valid and binding instrument enforceable
          against the Company and each Subsidiary Guarantor (to the extent a
          party thereto) in accordance with their terms (subject, as to the
          enforcement of remedies, to applicable bankruptcy, reorganization,
          insolvency, moratorium or other laws affecting creditors' rights
          generally from time to

          time in effect and to general principles of equity); the Indenture
          has been duly authorized and, assuming due authorization, execution
          and delivery thereof by the Trustee, when executed and delivered by
          the Company and each Subsidiary Guarantor, will constitute a legal,
          valid and binding instrument enforceable against the Company and
          each Subsidiary Guarantor in accordance with its terms (subject, as
          to the enforcement of remedies, to applicable bankruptcy, fraudulent
          conveyance, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium or other laws
          affecting creditors' rights generally from time to time in effect
          and to general principles of equity); the Securities have been duly
          authorized, and, when executed and authenticated in accordance with
          the provisions of the Indenture and delivered to and paid for by the
          Initial Purchasers, will have been duly executed and delivered by
          the Company and each Subsidiary Guarantor and (assuming the due
          authorization, execution and delivery of the Indenture by the
          Trustee) will constitute the legal, valid and binding obligations of
          the Company and each Subsidiary Guarantor entitled to the benefits
          of the Indenture (subject, as to the enforcement of remedies, to
          applicable bankruptcy, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization,
          insolvency, moratorium or other laws affecting creditors' rights
          generally from time to time in effect and to general principles of
          equity, good faith and fair dealing, regardless of whether in a
          proceeding at law or in equity); and the Registration Rights
          Agreement has been duly authorized and, when executed and delivered
          by the Company and each Subsidiary Guarantor, will constitute a
          legal, valid and binding instrument enforceable against the Company
          and each Subsidiary Guarantor in accordance with its terms (subject,
          as to the enforcement of remedies, to applicable bankruptcy,
          fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium or
          other laws affecting creditors' rights generally from time to time
          in effect and to general principles of equity and except that the
          enforceability of any rights to contribution or indemnification may
          be violative of public policy under any law, rule or regulation).

                  (r) Subject to compliance by the Initial Purchasers with the
          representations, warranties and agreements set forth in Section 4 of
          this Agreement, no consent, approval, authorization, filing with or
          order of any court or governmental agency or body is required in
          connection with the transactions contemplated herein, in the
          Indenture, the Security Documents (other than the filing of Uniform
          Commercial Code financing statements) or the Registration Rights
          Agreement, except such as will be obtained under the Securities Act
          and the Trust Indenture Act (with respect to the Registration Rights
          Agreement), the securities laws of any jurisdiction outside the U.S.
          in which the Securities are offered and such as may be required
          under the blue sky laws of any jurisdiction and the National
          Association of Securities Dealers Inc. in connection with the
          purchase and distribution of the Securities by the Initial

          of the Indenture, this Agreement or the Registration Rights
          Agreement, the issue and sale of the Securities, nor the fulfillment
          of the terms hereof, thereof or of the Security Documents will
          conflict with, result in a breach or violation of, or imposition of
          any lien, charge or encumbrance upon any property or assets of the
          Company or any of its subsidiaries pursuant to (other than the
          Security Interests) (i) the charter or by-laws of either of the
          Company or any subsidiary, (ii) any statute, rule, regulation or
          order of any governmental agency or body or any court, domestic or
          foreign, having jurisdiction over the Company or any subsidiary

          any agreement or instrument to which the Company or any such
          subsidiary is a party or by which the Company or any such subsidiary
          is bound or to which any of the properties of the Company or any of
          its subsidiaries is subject.

                  (t) The consolidated historical financial statements and
          schedules of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries included
          in or incorporated by reference in the Final Memorandum present
          fairly in all material respects the financial condition, results of
          operations and cash flows of the Company as of the dates and for the
          periods indicated, comply as to form with the applicable accounting
          requirements of the Securities Act and have been prepared in
          conformity with generally accepted accounting principles applied on
          a consistent basis throughout the periods involved (except as
          otherwise noted therein); the selected financial data set forth
          under the caption "Selected Consolidated Financial Information" in
          the Final Memorandum fairly present, on the basis stated in the
          Final Memorandum, the information included therein.

                  (u) No action, suit or proceeding by or before any court or
          governmental agency, authority or body or any arbitrator involving
          the Company or any of its subsidiaries or its or their property is
          pending or, to the best knowledge of the Company or the Subsidiary
          Guarantors, threatened that (i) could reasonably be expected to have
          a material adverse effect on the performance of this Agreement, the
          Security Documents, the Indenture or the Registration Rights
          Agreement, or the consummation of any of the transactions
          contemplated hereby or thereby; or (ii) could reasonably be expected
          to have a Material Adverse Effect, except as set forth in or
          contemplated in the Final Memorandum (exclusive of any amendment or
          supplement thereto).

                  (v) The Company and each of its subsidiaries own or lease
          all such properties as are necessary to the conduct of their
          respective operations as presently conducted, except where the
          failure to own or lease such property could not reasonably be
          expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

                  (w) Neither the Company nor any subsidiary is in violation
          or default of (i) any provision of its charter or bylaws; (ii) the
          terms of any agreement or instrument to which it is a party or bound
          or to which its property is subject; or (iii) any statute, rule,
          regulation or order of any governmental agency or body or any court,
          domestic or foreign, having jurisdiction over the Company or any
          subsidiary of the Company or any of their properties, as applicable,
          except in the case of (ii) and (iii), such violation or default that
          could not reasonably by expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

          financial statements of the Company and its consolidated
          subsidiaries and delivered their report with respect to the audited

          Company, independent public accountants with respect to the Company
          within the meaning of the Securities Act and the applicable
          published rules and regulations thereunder.

                  (z) The Company has filed all foreign, federal, state and
          local tax returns that are required to be filed or has requested
          extensions thereof (except in any case in which the failure so to

          in or contemplated in the Final Memorandum (exclusive of any
          amendment or supplement thereto)) and has paid all taxes required to
          be paid by it and any other assessment, fine or penalty levied
          against it, to the extent that any of the foregoing is due and
          payable, except for any such assessment, fine or penalty that is
          currently being contested in good faith or as would not have a
          Material Adverse Effect, except as set forth in or contemplated in
          the Final Memorandum (exclusive of any amendment or supplement

          imminent, and the Company is not aware of any existing or imminent
          labor disturbance by the employees of any of its or its
          subsidiaries' principal suppliers, contractors or customers that
          could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect,
          except as set forth in or contemplated in the Final Memorandum
          (exclusive of any amendment or supplement thereto).

                  (bb) The Company and each of its subsidiaries are insured by
          insurers of recognized financial responsibility against such losses
          and risks and in such amounts as are prudent and customary in the
          businesses in which they are engaged; the Company and its
          subsidiaries are in compliance with the terms of such policies and
          instruments in all material respects, except where noncompliance
          could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect;
          and neither the Company nor any such subsidiary has any reason to
          believe that it will not be able to renew or replace its existing
          insurance coverage as and when such coverage expires or to obtain
          similar coverage from similar insurers as may be necessary to
          continue its business at a cost that would not have a Material
          Adverse Effect, except as set forth in or contemplated in the Final
          Memorandum (exclusive of any amendment or supplement thereto).

                  (cc) No subsidiary of the Company is currently prohibited,
          directly or indirectly, from paying any dividends to the Company,
          from making any other distribution on such subsidiary's capital
          stock, from repaying to the Company any loans or advances to such
          subsidiary from the Company or from transferring any of such
          subsidiary's property or assets to the Company or any other
          subsidiary of the Company, except as described in or contemplated by
          the Final Memorandum.

                  (dd) The Company and its subsidiaries possess all licenses,
          certificates, permits and other authorizations issued by the
          appropriate federal, state or foreign regulatory authorities
          necessary to conduct their respective businesses, except where the
          failure to possess such licenses, certificates, permits and other
          authorizations could not reasonably be expected to have a Material
          Adverse Effect, and neither the Company nor any such subsidiary has
          received any notice of proceedings relating to the revocation or
          modification of any such certificate, authorization or permit which,
          singly or in the aggregate, if the subject of an unfavorable
          decision, ruling or finding, could reasonably be

                                      7
<PAGE>

          expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, except as set forth in
          or contemplated in the Final Memorandum (exclusive of any amendment
          or supplement thereto).

                  (ee) The Company and its subsidiaries (i) are in compliance
          with any and all applicable foreign, federal, state and local laws
          and regulations relating to the protection of human health and
          safety, the environment or hazardous or toxic substances or wastes,
          pollutants or contaminants ("Environmental Laws"); (ii) have
          received and are in compliance with all permits, licenses or other
          approvals required of them under applicable Environmental Laws to
          conduct their respective businesses; and (iii) have not received
          notice of any actual or potential liability for the investigation or
          remediation of any disposal or release of hazardous or toxic
          substances or wastes, pollutants or contaminants, except where such
          non-compliance with Environmental Laws, failure to receive required
          permits, licenses or other approvals, or liability would not,
          individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect,
          except as set forth in the Final Memorandum (exclusive of any
          amendment or supplement thereto); except as set forth in the Final
          Memorandum, neither the Company nor any of the subsidiaries has been
          named as a "potentially responsible party" under the Comprehensive
          Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as
          amended, which, if the subject of any unfavorable ruling, decision
          or finding could, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
          expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

                  (ff) Each of the Company and its subsidiaries has fulfilled
          its obligations, if any, under the minimum funding standards of
          Section 302 of the United States Employee Retirement Income Security
          Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"), and the regulations and published
          interpretations thereunder with respect to each "plan" (as defined
          in Section 3(3) of ERISA and such regulations and published
          interpretations) in which employees of the Company and its
          subsidiaries are eligible to participate; the Company and its
          subsidiaries have not incurred any unpaid liability to the Pension
          Benefit Guaranty Corporation (other than for the payment of premiums
          in the ordinary course) or to any such plan under Title IV of ERISA.

                  (gg) The Company and its subsidiaries own, possess, license
          or have other rights to use, on reasonable terms, all patents,
          patent applications, trade and service marks, trade and service mark
          registrations, trade names, copyrights, licenses, inventions, trade
          secrets, technology, know-how and other intellectual property
          (collectively, the "Intellectual Property") necessary for the
          conduct of the Company's business as now conducted or as proposed in
          the Final Memorandum to be conducted, except as otherwise referenced
          in the Final Memorandum where the failure to own such Intellectual
          Property could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
          Effect. Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has received
          any charge, complaint, claim, demand or notice alleging any
          interference, infringement, misappropriation or violation of a third
          party's right in Intellectual Property (including any claim that the
          Company or any of its subsidiaries must license or refrain from
          using such Intellectual Property), which, if the subject of any
          unfavorable ruling, decision or finding could, individually or in
          the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
          Effect.

                  (hh) The Company maintains, and has maintained during the
          periods covered by the Exchange Act reports incorporated by
          reference in the Final Memorandum, disclosure

                                      8
<PAGE>

          controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-14
          under the Exchange Act) that are effective in ensuring that
          information required to be disclosed in the reports that it files or
          submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
          and reported with the time periods specified in the rules and forms
          of the Commission, including, without limitation, effective controls
          and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be so
          described is accumulated and communicated to the Company's
          management, including its principal executive officer or officers,
          and its principal financial officer or officers, as appropriate to
          allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure, except as
          disclosed in such reports with respect to the Company's 1997 fiscal
          year and that the Company restated its financial statements for the
          1998 and 1999 fiscal years.

                  (ii) The Security Documents listed on Schedule II hereto
          represent all of the guarantee agreements, security agreements,
          mortgages, intercreditor agreements and other similar agreements
          necessary to effectuate the Subsidiary Guarantors' subordinated
          guarantee of the obligations under the Securities and grant to the
          holders of the Securities a shared second priority lien on the
          Collateral, other than UCC financing statements. Other than
          Representative Supplement No. 1, dated as of April 4, 2002, to the
          Intercreditor Agreement, none of the Security Documents have been
          amended or otherwise modified since the date of the original
          execution thereof.

                  (jj) Since June 27, 2001, neither the Company nor any
          Subsidiary Guarantor has taken any action or omitted to take any
          action, or entered into any agreement that resulted or would result
          in (i) the release or modification of any Security Interest granted
          under the Security Documents, other than in accordance with the
          terms of the Security Documents or (ii) any of the Security
          Documents failing to be in full force and effect.

          Any certificate signed by any officer of the Company or any
Subsidiary Guarantor and delivered to the Representatives or counsel for the
Initial Purchasers in connection with the offering of the Securities shall be
deemed a representation and warranty by the Company or such Subsidiary
Guarantor, as to matters covered thereby, to each Initial Purchaser.

               2. Purchase and Sale. Subject to the terms and conditions and
    in reliance upon the representations and warranties herein set forth, the
    Company agrees to sell to each Initial Purchaser, and each Initial
    Purchaser agrees, severally and not jointly, to purchase from the Company,
    at a purchase price of 97.25% of the principal amount thereof, plus
    accrued interest, if any, from February 12, 2003 to the Closing Date, the
    principal amount of Securities set forth opposite such Initial Purchaser's
    name on Schedule I hereto.

               3. Delivery and Payment. Delivery of and payment for the
    Securities shall be made at 10:00 A.M., New York City time, on February
    12, 2003, which date and time may be postponed by agreement between the
    Representatives and the Company or as provided in Section 9 hereof (such
    date and time of delivery and payment for the Securities being herein
    called the "Closing Date"). Delivery of the Securities shall be made to
    the Representatives for the respective accounts of the several Initial
    Purchasers against payment by the several Initial Purchasers through the
    Representatives of the purchase price thereof to or upon the order of the
    Company by wire transfer payable in same-day funds to the account
    specified by the Company.

                                      9
<PAGE>

     Delivery of the Securities shall be made through the facilities of The
     Depository Trust Company unless the Representatives shall otherwise
     instruct.

               4. Offering by Initial Purchasers. Each Initial Purchaser,
    severally and not jointly, represents and warrants to and agrees with the
    Company that:

                  (a) It is a qualified institutional buyer (as defined in
          Rule 144A under the Securities Act) or an institutional accredited
          investor (as defined in Rule 501(a) under the Securities Act).

                  (b) It has not offered or sold, and will not offer or sell,
          any Securities except (i) to those persons it reasonably believes to
          be qualified institutional buyers (as defined in Rule 144A under the
          Securities Act) and that, in connection with each such sale, it has
          taken or will take reasonable steps to ensure that the purchaser of
          such Securities is aware that such sale is being made in reliance on
          Rule 144A; or (ii) in accordance with the restrictions set forth in
          Exhibit A hereto.

                  (c) Neither it nor any person acting on its behalf has made
          or will make offers or sales of the Securities in the United States
          by means of any form of general solicitation or general advertising
          (within the meaning of Regulation D) in the United States.

               5. Agreements. The Company and each of the Subsidiary
    Guarantors jointly and severally agree with each Initial Purchaser that:

                  (a) The Company will furnish to each Initial Purchaser and
          to counsel for the Initial Purchasers, without charge, during the
          period referred to in paragraph (c) below, as many copies of the
          Final Memorandum and any amendments and supplements thereto as you
          may reasonably request.

                  (b) The Company will not amend or supplement the Final
          Memorandum without the prior written consent of the Representatives,
          which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

                  (c) If at any time prior to the completion of the sale of
          the Securities by the Initial Purchasers (as determined by the
          Representatives), any event occurs as a result of which the Final
          Memorandum, as then amended or supplemented, would include any
          untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
          fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the
          circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or if it
          shall be necessary to amend or supplement the Final Memorandum to
          comply with applicable law, the Company promptly (i) will notify the
          Representatives of any such event; (ii) subject to the requirements
          of paragraph (b) of this Section 5, will prepare an amendment or
          supplement that will correct such statement or omission or effect
          such compliance; and (iii) will supply any supplemented or amended
          Final Memorandum to the several Initial Purchasers and counsel for
          the Initial Purchasers without charge in such quantities as you may
          reasonably request.

                                      10

                  (d) The Company will arrange, if necessary, for the
          qualification of the Securities for sale by the Initial Purchasers
          under the laws of such jurisdictions as the Representatives may
          designate and will maintain such qualifications in effect so long as
          required for the sale of the Securities, provided that in no event
          shall the Company or any subsidiary be obligated to qualify to do
          business in any jurisdiction where it is not now so qualified or to
          take any action that would subject it to service of process in
          suits, other than those arising out of the offering or sale of the
          Securities, in any jurisdiction where it is not now so subject. The
          Company will promptly advise the Representatives of the receipt by
          the Company of any notification with respect to the suspension of
          the qualification of the Securities for sale in any jurisdiction or
          the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose.

                  (e) The Company will not, and will not permit any of its
          controlled Affiliates to, and will use its reasonable best efforts
          not to permit any of its other Affiliates to, resell any Securities
          that have been acquired by any of them.

                  (f) Neither the Company, nor any of its Affiliates, nor any
          person acting on its or their behalf (other than the Initial
          Purchasers and their Affiliates) will, directly or indirectly, make
          offers or sales of any security, or solicit offers to buy any
          security, under circumstances that would require the registration of
          the Securities under the Securities Act.

                  (g) Neither the Company, nor any of its Affiliates, nor any
          person acting on its or their behalf (other than the Initial
          Purchasers or anyone acting on their behalf, as to whom the Company
          makes no agreement) will engage in any form of general solicitation
          or general advertising (within the meaning of Regulation D) in
          connection with any offer or sale of the Securities in the United
          States.

                  (h) So long as any of the Securities are "restricted
          securities" within the meaning of Rule 144(a)(3) under the
          Securities Act, the Company will, during any period in which it is
          not subject to and in compliance with Section 13 or 15(d) of the
          Exchange Act or it is not exempt from such reporting requirements
          pursuant to and in compliance with Rule 12g3-2(b) under the Exchange
          Act, provide to each holder of such restricted securities and to
          each prospective purchaser (as designated by such holder) of such
          restricted securities, upon the request of such holder or
          prospective purchaser, any information required to be provided by
          Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act. This covenant is intended
          to be for the benefit of the holders, and the prospective purchasers
          designated by such holders, from time to time of such restricted
          securities.

                  (i) Neither the Company, nor any of its Affiliates, nor any
          person acting on its or their behalf (other than the Initial
          Purchasers or anyone acting on their behalf, as to whom the Company
          makes no agreement) will engage in any directed selling efforts with
          respect to the Securities, and each of them will comply with the
          offering restrictions requirements of Regulation S. Terms used in
          this paragraph have the meanings given to them by Regulation S.

                                      11
<PAGE>

                  (j) The Company will cooperate with the Representatives and
          use its best efforts to permit the Securities to be eligible for
          clearance and settlement through The Depository Trust Company.

                  (k) The Company will not offer, sell, contract to sell,
          grant any other option to purchase or otherwise dispose of, directly
          or indirectly, or announce the offering of, or file a registration
          statement for, any debt securities issued or guaranteed by the
          Company or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries, or enter into
          any agreement to do any of the foregoing (other than (i) the
          Securities and the Exchange Notes, (ii) pursuant to any credit
          facility permitted under the Indenture, (iii) purchase money debt
          permitted under the Indenture and (iv) notes on similar terms to the
          Securities in order to refinance or in exchange for the 12.5% Notes)
          for a period of 90 days from the date the Securities are issued
          without the prior written consent of Salomon Smith Barney Inc.

                  (l) The Company will not take, directly or indirectly, any
          action designed to or that would constitute or that might reasonably
          be expected to cause or result in, under the Exchange Act or
          otherwise, the stabilization or manipulation of the price of any
          security of the Company to facilitate the sale or resale of the
          Securities.

                  (m) The Company currently has no plan or intent to be or
          become, or be or become owned by, an open-end investment company,
          unit investment trust or face-amount certificate company that is or
          is required to be registered under Section 8 of the Investment
          Company Act.

                  (n) The Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors agree to pay
          the costs and expenses relating to the following matters: (i) the
          preparation of the Indenture, the Registration Rights Agreement and
          the Security Documents, the issuance of the Securities, the
          recording and perfection of security interests pursuant to the
          Security Documents and the fees of the Trustee and the collateral
          agents and trustees under the Security Documents (other than the
          legal fees and expenses of counsel to the Initial Purchasers in
          connection with the foregoing); (ii) the preparation, printing or
          reproduction of the Preliminary Memorandum and Final Memorandum and
          each amendment or supplement to either of them; (iii) the printing
          (or reproduction) and delivery (including postage, air freight
          charges and charges for counting and packaging) of such copies of
          the Preliminary Memorandum and Final Memorandum, and all amendments
          or supplements to either of them, as may, in each case, be
          reasonably requested for use in connection with the offering and
          sale of the Securities; (iv) the preparation, printing,
          authentication, issuance and delivery of certificates for the
          Securities, including any stamp or transfer taxes in connection with
          the original issuance and sale of the Securities; (v) the printing
          (or reproduction) and delivery of this Agreement, any blue sky
          memorandum and all other agreements or documents printed (or

          of counsel (including local and special counsel) for the Company;
          and (x) all other costs and expenses incident to the performance by
          the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors of its and their
          obligations hereunder and under the Indenture, the Registration

          however, that, except as provided in this Section 5 and Sections 7
          and 8 of this Agreement, the Initial Purchasers will pay all of
          their own costs and expenses, including the fees and expenses of
          their counsel.

                  (o) The Company shall cause any entity that is a Subsidiary
          Guarantor under the Indenture on the Closing Date and not set forth
          on Schedule III hereto to become a party to this Agreement, the
          Registration Rights Agreement and the Security Documents, if not
          already a party to the Security Documents, on or prior to the
          Closing Date.

                  (p) The Company will take all steps necessary to cure as
          soon as possible the good standing deficiency of its subsidiary 1525
          Cortyou Road-Brooklyn Inc. Within 30 days of such deficiency being
          cured, the Company shall provide the Initial Purchasers with
          evidence of the cure of such deficiency.

               6. Conditions to the Obligations of the Initial Purchasers. The
    obligations of the Initial Purchasers to purchase the Securities shall be
    subject to the accuracy of the representations and warranties on the part
    of the Company and each of the Subsidiary Guarantors contained herein at
    the Execution Time and the Closing Date, to the accuracy of the statements
    of the Company and each of the Subsidiary Guarantors made in any
    certificates pursuant to the provisions hereof, to the performance by the
    Company and each of the Subsidiary Guarantors of its obligations hereunder
    and to the following additional conditions:

                  (a) The Initial Purchasers shall have received an opinion,
          dated the Closing Date, of Robert Sari, Esq., general counsel for
          the Company, in form and substance satisfactory to the Initial

          Initial Purchasers, substantially in the form set forth in Schedule

          Securities, the Indenture, the Registration Rights Agreement, the
          Final Memorandum (as amended or supplemented at the Closing Date)
          and other related matters as the Representatives may reasonably
          require, and the Company shall have furnished to such counsel such
          documents as they reasonably request for the purpose of enabling
          them to pass upon such matters.

                  (d) The Company shall have furnished to the Representatives
          a certificate of the Company, signed by the Chairman of the Board or
          the President and the principal financial or accounting officer of
          the Company, dated the Closing Date, to the effect that the signers
          of such certificate have carefully examined the Final Memorandum,
          any amendment or supplement to the Final Memorandum and this
          Agreement and that:

                          (i) the representations and warranties of the
                  Company and each Subsidiary Guarantor in this Agreement are
                  true and correct on and as of the Closing Date with the same
                  effect as if made on the Closing Date, and the Company and
                  each Subsidiary Guarantor has complied with all the
                  agreements and satisfied all the conditions on its part to
                  be performed or satisfied hereunder at or prior to the
                  Closing Date; and

                          (ii) since the date of the most recent financial
                  statements included in the Final Memorandum (exclusive of
                  any amendment or supplement thereto), there has been no
                  material adverse change in the condition (financial or
                  otherwise), prospects, earnings, business or properties of
                  the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, whether
                  or not arising from transactions in the ordinary course of
                  business, except as set forth in or contemplated by the
                  Final Memorandum (exclusive of any amendment or supplement
                  thereto).

                   (e) On or prior to the Closing Date, each Security Document
          shall have been executed and delivered by the parties thereto and
          shall be in full force and effect and the obligations of the
          Subsidiary Guarantors in respect of the Securities and, when issued,
          the Exchange Notes shall be Second Priority Debt Obligations having
          the benefit of second priority security interests in the Second
          Priority Collateral.

                   (f) On or prior to the Closing Date, the Company and the
          Subsidiary Guarantors shall have caused to be delivered to the
          Trustee evidence satisfactory to the Trustee of the completion and
          effectiveness of all filings, recordings, registrations and other
          actions of the Security Documents, and such other financing
          statements and security documents, as may be necessary or, in the
          opinion of the Trustee, desirable to perfect the second priority
          liens created, or intended to be created, by the Security Documents
          in favor of the holders of Securities and Exchange Notes. All filing
          fees, taxes and other amounts payable in connection with such
          filings, recordings, registrations and other actions shall have been
          paid (unless such amounts payable are not accepted at the time of
          such filing, recording, registration or other action and are
          otherwise billed to the Company) and the Trustee and the
          Representatives shall have received evidence satisfactory to them of
          such filings, recordings, registrations and other actions and
          payments.

                   (g) At the Execution Time and at the Closing Date, the
          Company shall have requested and caused Deloitte & Touche LLP to
          furnish to the Representatives letters, dated respectively as of the
          Execution Time and as of the Closing Date, in form and substance
          satisfactory to the Representatives, confirming that they are
          independent accountants within the meaning of the Securities Act and
          the Exchange Act and the

                                      14
<PAGE>

          respective applicable rules and regulations adopted by the
          Commission thereunder, and stating in effect that:

                         (i) in their opinion the audited financial statements
               included or incorporated in the Final Memorandum and reported
               on by them comply as to form in all material respects with the
               applicable accounting requirements of the Exchange Act and the
               related rules and regulations adopted by the Commission
               thereunder that would apply to the Final Memorandum if the
               Final Memorandum were a prospectus included in a registration
               statement on Form S-1 under the Securities Act;

                         (ii) on the basis of a reading of the latest
               unaudited financial statements made available by the Company
               and its subsidiaries; their limited review, in accordance with
               the standards established under Statement on Auditing Standards
               No. 71, of the unaudited interim financial information for the
               nine-month period ended November 30, 2002, and as at November
               30, 2002; carrying out certain specified procedures (but not an
               examination in accordance with generally accepted auditing
               standards) which would not necessarily reveal matters of
               significance with respect to the comments set forth in such
               letter; a reading of the minutes of the meetings of the
               stockholders, directors and audit, executive and compensation
               committees of the Company and the Subsidiaries; and inquiries
               of certain officials of the Company who have responsibility for
               financial and accounting matters of the Company and its
               subsidiaries as to transactions and events subsequent to
               November 30, 2002, nothing came to their attention which caused
               them to believe that:

                         (1) any unaudited financial statements included or
                    incorporated in the Final Memorandum do not comply in form
                    in all material respects with applicable accounting
                    requirements and with the related rules and regulations
                    adopted by the Commission with respect to financial
                    statements included or incorporated in quarterly reports
                    on Form 10-Q under the Exchange Act; or said unaudited
                    financial statements are not in conformity with generally
                    accepted accounting principles applied on a basis
                    substantially consistent with that of the audited
                    financial statements included or incorporated in the Final
                    Memorandum;

                         (2) with respect to the period subsequent to November
                    30, 2002, there were any changes, at a specified date not
                    more than five days prior to the date of the letter, in
                    the long-term debt less current maturities of the Company
                    and its subsidiaries or common stock of the Company or
                    increases in the stockholders' deficit of the Company as
                    compared with the amounts shown on the November 30, 2002
                    consolidated balance sheet included or incorporated in the
                    Final Memorandum, or for the period from December 1, 2002
                    to such specified date there were any decreases, as
                    compared with the corresponding period in the preceding
                    year, in revenues, increases in net loss or loss from
                    continuing operations before income taxes and cumulative
                    effect of accounting change or in net loss per share of
                    the Company and its subsidiaries, except in all instances
                    for

                                      15
<PAGE>

                    changes or decreases set forth in such letter, in which
                    case the letter shall be accompanied by an explanation by
                    the Company as to the significance thereof unless said
                    explanation is not deemed necessary by the
                    Representatives; or

                         (3) the information included in response to
                    Regulation S-K, Item 301 (Selected Financial Data), Item
                    302 (Supplementary Financial Information), Item 402
                    (Executive Compensation) and Item 503(d) (Ratio of
                    Earnings to Fixed Charges) is not in conformity with the
                    disclosure requirements of Regulation S-K.

                         (iii) they have performed certain other specified
               procedures as a result of which they determined that certain
               information of an accounting, financial or statistical nature
               (which is limited to accounting, financial or statistical
               information derived from the general accounting records of the
               Company and its subsidiaries) set forth in the Final
               Memorandum, including the information set forth under the
               captions "Summary", "Risk Factors", "Use of Proceeds",
               "Capitalization", "Selected Consolidated Financial
               Information", "Management's Discussion and Analysis of
               Financial Condition and Results of Operations", "Business",
               "Management", "Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners
               and Management", "Certain Relationships and Related
               Transactions", "Description of Other Indebtedness",
               "Description of Collateral and Intercreditor Arrangements" and
               "Description of Notes" in the Final Memorandum, agrees with the
               accounting records of the Company and its subsidiaries,
               excluding any questions of legal interpretation;

               References to the Final Memorandum in this Section 6(g) include
               any amendment or supplement thereto at the date of the
               applicable letter.

                  (h) Subsequent to the Execution Time or, if earlier, the
          dates as of which information is given in the Final Memorandum
          (exclusive of any amendment or supplement thereto), there shall not
          have been, other than the redemption of the Shareholder Notes or any
          other repurchase of indebtedness, (i) any change or decrease
          specified in the letter or letters referred to in paragraph (g) of
          this Section 6; or (ii) any change, or any development involving a
          prospective change, in or affecting the condition (financial or
          otherwise), prospects, earnings, business or properties of the
          Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, whether or not
          arising from transactions in the ordinary course of business, except
          as set forth in or contemplated in the Final Memorandum (exclusive
          of any amendment or supplement thereto) the effect of which, in any
          case referred to in clause (i) or (ii) above, is, in the sole
          judgment of the Representatives, so material and adverse as to make
          it impractical or inadvisable to market the Securities as
          contemplated by the Final Memorandum (exclusive of any amendment or
          supplement thereto). (i) The Securities shall have been designated
          as Portal-eligible securities in accordance with the rules and
          regulations of the NASD, and the Securities shall be eligible for
          clearance and settlement through The Depository Trust Company.

                  (j) Subsequent to the Execution Time, there shall not have
          been any decrease in the rating of any of the Company's debt
          securities by any "nationally recognized statistical rating
          organization" (as defined for purposes of Rule 436(g) under the
          Securities Act), any notice given of any intended or potential
          decrease in any such rating (including notice of an adverse change
          in the outlook for such rating) or of a possible change in any such
          rating that does not indicate the direction of the possible change.

                  (k) On or prior to the Closing Date, the Registration
          Rights Agreement shall be in form and substance satisfactory to the
          Representatives, shall have been executed and delivered by the
          parties thereto and shall be in full force and effect.

                  (l) On or prior to the Closing Date, Amendment No. 4 to the
          Senior Credit Facility, in the form attached as Exhibit B hereto,
          shall have been executed and delivered by the parties thereto and
          shall be in full force and effect.

                  (m) On or prior to the Closing Date but prior to the
          issuance of the Securities, the Company shall have used a portion of
          its available cash to redeem all outstanding Shareholder Notes and
          the Representatives shall have received evidence satisfactory to
          them of such redemption.

                  (n) On or prior to the Closing Date, the Amendment and
          Consent to the Synthetic Lease Facility, in the form attached as
          Exhibit C hereto, shall have been executed and delivered by the
          parties thereto and shall be in full force and effect.

                  (o) On or prior to the Closing Date, the Representative
          Supplement shall have been duly executed and delivered by the Second
          Priority Collateral Trustee, Senior Collateral Agent and Trustee,
          and all of the conditions to the Trustee becoming a party to the
          Intercreditor Agreement shall have been satisfied.

                  (p) On or prior to the Closing Date, an amendment to the
          Second Priority Subsidiary Security Agreement incorporating the
          definitions included in the Senior Subsidiary Security Agreement
          into the Second Priority Subsidiary Security Agreement, in form and
          substance satisfactory to the Representatives, shall have been
          executed and delivered by the parties thereto and shall be in full
          force and effect.

                  (q) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall have
          furnished to the Representatives such further information,
          certificates and documents as the Representatives may reasonably
          request.

          If any of the conditions specified in this Section 6 shall
not have been fulfilled in all material respects when and as provided in this
Agreement, or if any of the opinions and certificates mentioned above or
elsewhere in this Agreement shall not be in all material respects reasonably
satisfactory in form and substance to the Representatives and counsel for the
Initial Purchasers, this Agreement and all obligations of the Initial
Purchasers hereunder may be canceled at, or at any time prior to, the Closing
Date by the Representatives. Notice of such cancellation shall be given to the
Company in writing or by telephone or facsimile confirmed in writing.

                                      17
<PAGE>

         The documents required to be delivered by this Section 6 will be
delivered at the office of counsel for the Initial Purchasers, at Cravath,
Swaine & Moore, 825 Eighth Avenue, New York, NY 10019, on the Closing Date.

          7. Reimbursement of Expenses. If the sale of the Securities provided
    for herein is not consummated because any condition to the obligations of
    the Initial Purchasers set forth in Section 6 hereof is not satisfied,
    because of any termination pursuant to Section 10 hereof or because of any
    refusal, inability or failure on the part of the Company or any Subsidiary
    Guarantor to perform any agreement herein or comply with any provision
    hereof other than by reason of a default by any of the Initial Purchasers,
    the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors, jointly and severally, will
    reimburse the Initial Purchasers severally through Salomon Smith Barney
    Inc. on demand for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including
    reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) that shall have been
    incurred by them in connection with the proposed purchase and sale of the
    Securities.

          8. Indemnification and Contribution. (a) The Company and each of the
    Subsidiary Guarantors jointly and severally agree to indemnify and hold
    harmless each Initial Purchaser, the directors, officers, employees,
    affiliates and agents of each Initial Purchaser and each person who
    controls any Initial Purchaser within the meaning of either the Securities
    Act or the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or
    liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become
    subject under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or other Federal or
    state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as
    such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect
    thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged
    untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Preliminary
    Memorandum, the Final Memorandum (or in any supplement or amendment
    thereto), or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged
    omission to state therein a material fact necessary to make the statements
    therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
    misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party, as
    incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in
    connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage,
    liability or action; provided, however, that the Company and the
    Subsidiary Guarantors will not be liable in any such case to the extent
    that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based
    upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or
    alleged omission made in the Preliminary Memorandum or the Final
    Memorandum, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, in reliance
    upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company
    by or on behalf of any Initial Purchasers through the Representatives
    specifically for inclusion therein; provided further, however, that with
    respect to any untrue statement or omission of material fact made in any
    Preliminary Memorandum, the indemnity agreement contained in this Section
    8(a) shall not inure to the benefit of any Initial Purchaser from whom the
    person asserting any such loss, claim, damage or liability purchased the
    securities concerned, to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or
    liability of such Initial Purchaser occurs under the circumstance where it
    shall have been determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final
    and nonappealable judgment that (x) the Company had previously furnished
    copies of the Final Memorandum to the Representatives, (y) the untrue
    statement or omission of a material fact contained in the Preliminary
    Memorandum was corrected in the Final Memorandum and (z) there was not
    sent or given to such person, at or prior to the written confirmation of
    the sale of such securities to such person, a copy of the Final
    Memorandum. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability
    which the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors may otherwise have.

                                      18

                  (b) Each Initial Purchaser severally and not jointly
          agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its
          directors, each of its officers, and each person who controls the
          Company within the meaning of either the Securities Act or the
          Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the
          Company to each Initial Purchaser, but only with reference to
          written information relating to such Initial Purchaser furnished to
          the Company by or on behalf of such Initial Purchaser through the
          Representatives specifically for inclusion in the Preliminary
          Memorandum or the Final Memorandum (or in any amendment or
          supplement thereto). This indemnity agreement will be in addition to
          any liability which any Initial Purchaser may otherwise have. The
          Company acknowledges that the statements set forth in the last
          paragraph of the cover page regarding the delivery of the Securities
          and, under the heading "Plan of Distribution", (i) the list of
          Initial Purchasers and their respective participation in the sale of
          the Securities; (ii) the sentences related to concessions and
          reallowances; and (iii) the paragraph related to stabilization,
          syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids in the Preliminary
          Memorandum and the Final Memorandum, constitute the only information
          furnished in writing by or on behalf of the Initial Purchasers for
          inclusion in the Preliminary Memorandum or the Final Memorandum (or
          in any amendment or supplement thereto).

                  (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under
          this Section 8 of notice of the commencement of any action, such
          indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made
          against the indemnifying party under this Section 8, notify the
          indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the
          failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it
          from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the
          extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure
          results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial
          rights and defenses; and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the
          indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party
          other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a)
          or (b) above. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint
          counsel of the indemnifying party's choice at the indemnifying
          party's expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for
          which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying
          party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses
          of any separate counsel retained by the indemnified party or parties
          except as set forth below); provided, however, that such counsel
          shall be reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party.
          Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel
          to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified
          party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including
          local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable
          fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of
          counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the
          indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of
          interest; (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of,
          any such action include both the indemnified party and the
          indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably
          concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or
          other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to
          those available to the indemnifying party; (iii) the indemnifying
          party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the
          indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a
          reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action; or
          (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to
          employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. An
          indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of
          the indemnified parties (which consent shall not be unreasonably
          withheld), settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any
          judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action,
          suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or
          contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified

                                      19
<PAGE>

          parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action)
          unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an
          unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability
          arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding.

                  (d) In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph
          (a) or (b) of this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to
          hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, the Company, each
          Subsidiary Guarantor and the Initial Purchasers severally agree to
          contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities
          (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection
          with investigating or defending same) (collectively "Losses") to
          which the Company and one or more of the Initial Purchasers may be
          subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative
          benefits received by the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors on
          the one hand and by the Initial Purchasers on the other from the
          offering of the Securities; provided, however, that in no case shall
          any Initial Purchaser (except as may be provided in any agreement
          among the Initial Purchasers relating to the offering of the
          Securities) be responsible for any amount in excess of the purchase
          discount or commission applicable to the Securities purchased by
          such Initial Purchaser hereunder. If the allocation provided by the
          immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the
          Company, each Subsidiary Guarantor and the Initial Purchasers
          severally shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to
          reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault
          of the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors on the one hand and of
          the Initial Purchasers on the other in connection with the
          statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses, as well as
          any other relevant equitable considerations. Benefits received by
          the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors shall be deemed to be
          equal to the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting
          expenses) received by the Company, and benefits received by the
          Initial Purchasers shall be deemed to be equal to the total purchase
          discounts and commissions in each case set forth on the cover of the
          Final Memorandum. Relative fault shall be determined by reference
          to, among other things, whether any untrue or any alleged untrue
          statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to
          state a material fact relates to information provided by the Company
          on the one hand or the Initial Purchasers on the other, the intent
          of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information
          and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or
          omission. The Company, each Subsidiary Guarantor and the Initial
          Purchasers agree that it would not be just and equitable if
          contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other
          method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable
          considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of
          this paragraph (d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation
          (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be
          entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such
          fraudulent misrepresentation. The Initial Purchasers obligation to
          contribute pursuant to this Section 8(d) are several in proportion
          to their respective purchase obligations and not joint. For purposes
          of this Section 8, each person who controls an Initial Purchaser
          within the meaning of either the Securities Act or the Exchange Act
          and each director, officer, employee, affiliate and agent of an
          Initial Purchaser shall have the same rights to contribution as such
          Initial Purchaser, and each person who controls the Company within
          the meaning of either the Securities Act or the Exchange Act and
          each officer and director of the Company shall have the same rights
          to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to the
          applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (d).

            9. Default by an Initial Purchaser. If any one or more Initial
    Purchasers shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Securities agreed
    to be purchased by such Initial Purchaser

                                      20
<PAGE>

    hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the
    performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, the
    remaining Initial Purchasers shall be obligated severally to take up and
    pay for (in the respective proportions which the principal amount of
    Securities set forth opposite their names on Schedule I hereto bears to
    the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth opposite the names
    of all the remaining Initial Purchasers) the Securities which the
    defaulting Initial Purchaser or Initial Purchasers agreed but failed to
    purchase; provided, however, that in the event that the aggregate
    principal amount of Securities which the defaulting Initial Purchaser or
    Initial Purchasers agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the
    aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth on Schedule I hereto,
    the remaining Initial Purchasers shall have the right to purchase all, but
    shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Securities, and
    if such nondefaulting Initial Purchasers do not purchase all the
    Securities, this Agreement will terminate without liability to any
    nondefaulting Initial Purchaser or the Company. In the event of a default
    by any Initial Purchaser as set forth in this Section 9, the Closing Date
    shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding two Business Days, as
    the Representatives and the Company shall determine in order that the
    required changes in the Final Memorandum or in any other documents or
    arrangements may be effected. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall
    relieve any defaulting Initial Purchaser of its liability, if any, to the
    Company or any nondefaulting Initial Purchaser for damages occasioned by
    its default hereunder.

            10. Termination. This Agreement shall be subject to termination in
    the absolute discretion of the Representatives, by notice given to the
    Company prior to delivery of and payment for the Securities, if at any
    time prior to such time (i) trading in the Company's Common Stock shall
    have been suspended by the Commission, the New York Stock Exchange or the
    Pacific Stock Exchange or trading in securities generally on the New York
    Stock Exchange or the Pacific Stock Exchange shall have been suspended or
    limited or minimum prices shall have been established on either such
    Exchange; (ii) a banking moratorium shall have been declared either by
    Federal or New York State authorities; or (iii) there shall have occurred
    any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, declaration by the United
    States of a national emergency or war or other calamity or crisis the
    effect of which on financial markets is such as to make it, in the sole
    judgment of the Representatives, impracticable or inadvisable to proceed
    with the offering or delivery of the Securities as contemplated by the
    Final Memorandum (exclusive of any amendment or supplement thereto).

            11. Representations and Indemnities to Survive. The respective
    agreements, representations, warranties, indemnities and other statements
    of the Company or its officers and of the Initial Purchasers set forth in
    or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect,
    regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Initial
    Purchasers or the Company or any of the officers, directors, employees,
    agents or controlling persons referred to in Section 8 hereof, and will
    survive delivery of and payment for the Securities. The provisions of
    Sections 7 and 8 hereof shall survive the termination or cancellation of
    this Agreement.

            12. Notices. All communications hereunder will be in writing and
    effective only on receipt, and, if sent to the Representatives, will be
    mailed, delivered or telefaxed to Salomon Smith Barney Inc. General
    Counsel (fax no.: (212) 816-7912) and confirmed to the General Counsel,

    officers, directors, employees, agents and controlling persons referred to
    in Section 8 hereof, and, except as expressly set forth in Section 5(h)
    hereof, no other person will have any right or obligation hereunder.

            14. Applicable Law. This Agreement will be governed by and
    construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York applicable
    to contracts made and to be performed within the State of New York.

more amendments of the indenture pursuant to which the Shareholder Notes were
issued and the Shareholder Notes (including any amendment not requiring the
consent of the trustee thereunder or the holders of the Shareholder Notes), in
each case to the extent necessary to provide additional covenants and other
terms substantively equivalent to any or all of the covenants and other terms
contained in the February 2003 Note Indenture when originally entered into and
(iii) confirm their consent to the prior issuance by the Borrower of the
Shareholder Notes and waive any noncompliance with the Senior Credit Facility

parties hereto to enter into this Amendment, the Borrower represents and
warrants to each of the Banks, the Senior Administrative Agent and the Senior
Collateral Agent that, as of the Amendment Effective Date (as defined below):

            (a) This Amendment has been duly authorized, executed and
delivered by it and constitutes its valid and binding obligation, enforceable
against it in accordance with its terms.

            (b) The representations and warranties set forth in Article IV of
the Senior Credit Facility are true and correct in all material respects on
and as of the Amendment Effective Date with the same effect as though made on
and as of the Amendment Effective Date, except to the extent such
representations and warranties expressly relate to an earlier date (in which
case such representations and warranties shall be true and correct as of such
earlier date).

            (c) After giving effect to the agreements herein, no Default has
occurred and is continuing.

            Section 4. Effectiveness. This Amendment, other than Section 1(f)
hereof, shall become effective on the first date (the "Amendment Effective
Date") on which the Senior Administrative Agent shall have received
counterparts of this Amendment that, when taken together, bear the signatures
of the Majority Banks, the Borrower and the Senior Administrative Agent.
Section 1(f) of this Agreement shall become effective on the first date on
which (i) the condition set forth in the immediately preceding sentence is
satisfied and (ii) Rite Aid shall have issued the February 2003 Notes in an
aggregate principal amount of not less than $150,000,000

                                      4
<PAGE>

and the indenture governing the February 2003 Notes shall have been executed
and delivered and, unless the Majority Banks shall have otherwise consented,
shall contain terms that are not substantially less favorable to the Banks
than those set forth in Annex A to this Amendment (and shall be deemed to have
become effective on such date immediately prior to any repurchase or
redemption of the Shareholder Notes on such date that occurs prior to such
issuance).

            Section 5. Governing Law. This Amendment shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.

            Section 6. Reference to Senior Credit Facility. Except as amended
hereby, the Senior Credit Facility shall remain in full force and effect and
is hereby ratified and confirmed in all respects. On and after the Amendment
Effective Date, each reference in the Senior Credit Facility to "this
Agreement", "hereunder", "hereof", "herein", or words of like import, and each
reference to the Senior Credit Facility shall be deemed a reference to the
Senior Credit Facility, as amended hereby, as the case may be. This Amendment
shall constitute a "Senior Loan Document" for all purposes of the Senior
Credit Facility and the other Senior Loan Documents.

            Section 7. Costs and Expenses. The Borrower agrees to reimburse
the Senior Administrative Agent for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses in
connection with this Amendment, including the reasonable fees, charges and
disbursements of counsel for the Senior Administrative Agent.

            Section 8. Counterparts. This Amendment may be executed in any
number of counterparts and by different parties hereto in separate
counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be deemed an
original, but all such counterparts together shall constitute but one and the
same instrument. Delivery of any executed counterpart of a signature page of
this Amendment by facsimile transmission shall be as effective as delivery of
a manually executed counterpart hereof.

            Section 9. Headings. The headings of this Amendment are for
purposes of reference only and shall not limit or otherwise affect the meaning
hereof.

            This Annex A summarizes the primary differences between the
covenants and certain other provisions contained in the 11 1/4% Senior Notes
due 2008 (the "11 1/4% Notes") of Rite Aid Corporation ("Rite Aid") and the
covenants and other provisions to be contained in the Senior Secured Notes due
2011 (the "February 2003 Notes") of Rite Aid. Unless otherwise noted below,
capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined have a substantially
similar meaning to the meaning assigned to them in the Indenture under which
the 11 1/4% Notes were issued. Rite Aid 's obligations under the February 2003
Notes will be guaranteed, subject to certain limitations, by Rite Aid's
subsidiaries that guarantee Rite Aid's obligations under the Senior Credit
Facility. The guarantees will be secured by second priority liens granted by
the subsidiary guarantors on all their assets that secure Rite Aid's
obligations under the Senior Credit Facility, subject to certain exceptions.
The second priority liens will be shared with certain existing and future
indebtedness and certain of such indebtedness will have priority over the
February 2003 Notes in distributions of the collateral. The February 2003
Notes include additional provisions relating to the subsidiary guarantees, the
security interests, the collateral and various agreements related to the
foregoing.

Covenants

<S>                                     <C>
Limitation on Debt                      Substantially similar except that the February 2003
                                        Notes permit additional Debt to be Incurred. In addition,
                                        under the February 2003 Notes (a) a number of "Permitted
                                        Debt" baskets permit such Debt by Subsidiaries that
                                        guarantee Rite Aid's obligations under the February 2003
                                        Notes rather than Restricted Subsidiaries, (b) Rite Aid may
                                        not permit any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a
                                        Subsidiary guarantor to Incur any Debt if the proceeds are
                                        used, directly or indirectly, to Refinance any Debt of Rite
                                        Aid or any Subsidiary guarantor, (c) Rite Aid may not, and
                                        may not permit any Subsidiary guarantor to, Incur, directly
                                        or indirectly, any Debt sharing the collateral on a first
                                        priority basis that is subordinate or junior in right of
                                        payment to any other Debt of Rite Aid or any Subsidiary
                                        guarantor and (d) certain reclassifications of indebtedness
                                        are not deemed Incurrences of indebtedness.

Limitation on Restricted Payments       Substantially similar, but the reference date is reset to
                                        the issue date of the February 2003 Notes. Also, under the
                                        February 2003 Notes an Investment with Rite Aid Common Stock
                                        is a Permitted Investment.

Limitation on Liens                     The 11 1/4% Notes permit Liens (other than Permitted Liens)
                                        only if the 11 1/4% Notes will be secured by such Lien
                                        equally and ratably with (or prior to) all other Debt
                                        secured by such Lien. The February 2003 Notes prohibit
                                        Liens, other than Permitted Liens. In addition, if Rite Aid
                                        or any Subsidiary guarantor creates any additional Lien upon
                                        any Property to secure any Debt sharing collateral with the
                                        February 2003 Notes, it must concurrently grant a second
                                        priority Lien (subject to Permitted Liens) upon such
                                        Property as security for the

                                                 1

                                        February 2003 Notes or Subsidiary guarantees of the February
                                        2003 Notes (except (a) as currently required by the 12.5%
                                        Senior Secured Notes due 2006 of Rite Aid (the "12.5%
                                        Notes") and the Senior Secured (Shareholder) Notes due 2006
                                        of Rite Aid (the "Shareholder Notes") with respect to
                                        proceeds of certain collateral dispositions and (b) to the
                                        extent such Property constitutes cash or cash equivalents
                                        securing only letter of credit obligations under Credit
                                        Facilities following a default).

                                        In addition, the aggregate amount of secured obligations
                                        that may share the collateral on a senior basis to the
                                        February 2003 Notes is limited to $2,700 million and the
                                        aggregate amount of secured Debt permitted under the $2,900
                                        million general Debt baskets is reduced by the amount of
                                        February 2003 Notes, 12.5% Notes and Shareholder Notes
                                        outstanding. These limits may fluctuate based upon
                                        fluctuations of the principal Debt basket (substantially as
                                        under the 113% Notes).

                                        Under the February 2003 Notes, Rite Aid will not, and will
                                        not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, secure any public
                                        Debt with a Lien on collateral securing the February 2003
                                        Notes unless the Lien is pari passu with the first priority
                                        obligations or with the February 2003 Notes (i.e., not
                                        layered between them).

                                        The definition of Permitted Liens is substantially similar
                                        except that any Property securing Debt under the principal
                                        Debt baskets must also secure the February 2003 Notes on a
                                        second priority basis and any Property securing the 12.5%
                                        Notes or Shareholder Notes must also secure the February
                                        2003 Notes on an equal and ratable basis.

Limitation on Asset Sales and           Substantially similar except that the February 2003 Notes
Specified Collateral Dispositions       provide that (a) to the extent the proceeds from specified
                                        collateral dispositions will be allocated pursuant to the
                                        terms of any other second priority debt obligations to Repay
                                        or provide for the Repayment of such second priority Debt
                                        obligations, a pro rata portion of such proceeds must be
                                        allocated to Repay the February 2003 Notes pursuant to an
                                        asset sales prepayment offer and (b) if the assets that were
                                        the subject of an asset disposition constituted collateral
                                        and Rite Aid reinvests in Additional Assets or Expansion
                                        Capital Expenditures, then such Additional Assets must be
                                        pledged as collateral or the improved assets subject to the
                                        Expansion Capital Expenditures must constitute collateral,
                                        in each case securing the February 2003

                                        second priority subsidiary guarantee agreement or an obligor
                                        with respect to any of the Debt sharing collateral with the
                                        February 2003 Notes (except for certain foreign
                                        Subsidiaries) to become a Subsidiary guarantor of the
                                        February 2003 Notes by becoming a party to the second

                                        payment to any other Debt of Rite Aid unless such guarantee
                                        is expressly subordinate in right of payment to its

                                        unless such guarantee is expressly subordinate in right of
                                        payment to or ranks pari passu with, the Subsidiary
                                        guarantee of such Subsidiary guarantor.

Additional Security Documents           If Rite Aid or any Subsidiary executes and delivers in
                                        respect of any Property any documents or instruments to
