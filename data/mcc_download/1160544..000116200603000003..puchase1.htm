<P>(i) all interest in and to telephone numbers and all listings pertaining to Seller's operations at the Austin Aero FBO

otherwise disposed of in the ordinary course of business).</P>

<P>1.2 Excluded Assets.</P>

<P>Notwithstanding the foregoing, all of the assets set forth on Schedule 1.2 (the "Excluded Assets") are expressly excluded
from the purchase and sale contemplated hereby and, as such, are not included in the Purchased Assets. </P>

<P>1.3 Assumption and Exclusion of Liabilities.</P>

<P>Except for the obligations of the Purchaser under Assumed Contracts arising after the Closing Date and with respect to
periods after the Closing Date, and those liabilities specifically listed on Schedule 1.3 (collectively, the "Assumed
Liabilities"), the Seller shall retain, and Purchaser shall not assume any other liabilities, obligations or undertakings of the
Seller of any nature whatsoever, whether accrued, absolute, fixed or contingent, known or unknown, due or to become due,
unliquidated or otherwise (collectively, the "Excluded Liabilities") including any liabilities relating to (a) accounts payable
of the Business, (b) all accrued liabilities and debts owed to third parties by Seller or its Affiliates, (c) Taxes with respect to
or attributable to the Purchased Assets for all taxable periods, or any portion thereof, up to and including the Closing Date

Assets that arose or relate to events that occurred prior to the Closing Date (including liabilities arising under
Environmental Laws), (f) all liabilities related to employees, including benefits and accrued vacation, for periods prior to
the Closing Date, (g) all of the liabilities, obligations and undertakings of the Seller arising prior to the Closing Date and
not expressly assumed by Purchaser in connection with the Assumed Contracts, (h) any liabilities of the Seller or any
Affiliate incurred prior to the Closing Date secured by any liens on the Purchased Assets, and (i) the Secured Debt. On the
Closing Date, Purchaser shall assume and agree to pay, defend, discharge and perform as and when due all of the Assumed
Liabilities and any liabilities associated with the Purchased Assets that relate to events that occur after the Closing Date.</P>

<P>1.4 Accounts Receivable.</P>

<P>Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, on the Closing Date, Seller shall convey, assign, transfer and deliver
to Purchaser the accounts receivable of the Business, as of the Closing Date, in the amounts identified in Schedule 1.4 (the
"Accounts Receivable"). Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to collect Accounts Receivable. In the event
Purchaser is, in its reasonable determination, unable to collect all or any part of one or more Accounts Receivable within 90
days of the Closing Date, Purchaser shall have the right to reconvey such Accounts Receivable to Seller, without recourse,
and the amounts of such reconveyed Accounts Receivable shall result in an equal reduction of the Purchase Price.
Purchaser shall have the right to offset any such reduction from the Escrow Amount or request payment from Seller of such
amount. Seller shall pay any amount so requested within ten business days of its receipt of such request.</P>

<P>1.5 Instruments of Conveyance.</P>

<P>The sale, conveyance, assignment, transfer and delivery of the Purchased Assets will be effected by the execution and
delivery by Seller and Purchaser of such deeds, bills of sale, assignment and assumption agreements, patent and trademark
assignments, and other instruments of transfer, all dated as of the Closing and reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser, as shall
be necessary to effectively vest in Purchaser good and marketable title in the Purchased Assets (the "Instruments of
Conveyance").</P>

<P>1.6 Nondelivered Assets.</P>

<P>Notwithstanding anything else contained in this Agreement, in the event that a Purchased Asset is not delivered by Seller to
Purchaser at Closing (a "Nondelivered Asset"), Seller shall deliver such Purchased Asset to Purchaser as soon as Seller has
actual knowledge of the existence of such Nondelivered Asset.</P>

<P>ARTICLE 2 </P>

<P>PURCHASE PRICE; OTHER CONSIDERATION</P>

<P>2.1 Purchase Price; Note; Additional Austin Purchase Price.</P>

<P>(a) In addition to the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities, the purchase price for the Purchased Assets, the Accounts
Receivable and all obligations of Seller hereunder shall be the amount of Eight Million, Five Hundred Thousand Dollars
($8,500,000) (the "Initial Purchase Price"). The Initial Purchase Price shall be paid to Seller in the following manner: (i)
One Million, Five Hundred Thousand Dollars, less the Escrow Amount, shall be paid by wire transfer in immediately
available funds to Seller at Closing, and (ii) Purchaser shall issue to Sterling-Austin a short term promissory note in the
amount of $7,000,000 (the "Note"), in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A. </P>

<P>(b) Subject to Section 2.8, in addition to the Purchase Price, on the closing date of the sale of each of the fixed base
operation locations listed on Schedule 2.1(b) (the "FBO Locations"), Purchaser shall wire to Seller in immediately available
funds the amount set forth next to the name of each such location on Schedule 2.1(b) (collectively, the "Additional Austin
Purchase Price"). If all of the conditions required to be completed by Seller, Sterling FBO Holdings, Inc. or any Affiliate
thereof or any seller under the purchase agreements related to the sale of the FBO Locations have been completed as of
February 17, 2003 or any date thereafter and Purchaser shall have failed to have closed the purchase of the FBO Locations
(other than as a result of any willful act or omission by the selling parties), then interest shall accrue and be payable on the
Additional Austin Purchase Price at the rate of 9% per annum starting on the later of the date all such closing conditions
shall have been satisfied and February 17, 2003, until the date such purchase of the FBO Locations shall close. Such
interest shall accrue based on a 365 day year. For purposes of clarification, interest accrued pursuant to this section 2.1(b)
shall only be paid if, and in the same portion as, the Additional Austin Purchase Price or portion thereof is paid.</P>

<P>(c) Any payment of Purchase Price or any other amounts due to Seller under this Agreement shall be paid 100% to
Sterling-Austin and 0% to Austin Aero.</P>

<P>2.2 Earn-Out.</P>

<P>(a) Subject to Sections 2.8 and 2.9 herein, Purchaser shall also pay an additional purchase price of up to $6,000,000 (the
"Aggregate Earn-Out Amount") to Seller based on the sale of retail Jet A Fuel (excluding Avgas, airline, government, fee
based and contract sales) (the "Jet A Fuel") at the Purchased FBO Facilities by Purchaser in the following manner:</P>

<P>(i) the Purchaser shall pay to Seller an amount (the "First Year Earn-Out") equal to the (x) excess of (A) the total number of
gallons of Jet A Fuel sold by the Purchased FBO Facilities during the period beginning, for each such Purchased FBO
Facility, on the first day following the closing date upon which the sale from Seller to Purchaser of such Purchased FBO
Facility was consummated and ending on December 31, 2003 over (B) the First Year Fuel Threshold, multiplied by (y)
$2.00. The First Year Earn-Out shall be paid by Purchaser to Seller by wire transfer in immediately available funds no later
than February 15, 2004;</P>

<P>(ii) the Purchaser shall pay to Seller an amount (the "Second Year Earn-Out") equal to the (x) excess of (A) the total
number of gallons of Jet A Fuel sold by the Purchased FBO Facilities during the period beginning on January 1, 2004 and
ending on December 31, 2004 over (B) the Second Year Fuel Threshold, multiplied by (y) $2.00. The Second Year
Earn-Out shall be paid by Purchaser to Seller by wire transfer in immediately available funds no later than February 15,
2005; and</P>

<P>(iii) the Purchaser shall pay to Seller an amount (the "Third Year Earn-Out") equal to the (x) excess of (A) the total number
of gallons of Jet A Fuel sold by the Purchased FBO Facilities during the period beginning on January 1, 2005 and ending
on December 31, 2005 over (B) the Third Year Fuel Threshold, multiplied by (y) $2.00. The Third Year Earn-Out shall be
paid by Purchaser to Seller by wire transfer in immediately available funds no later than February 15, 2006.</P>

<P>;provided, however, that, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no event shall the aggregate amount of
payments made pursuant to this Section 2.2 exceed $6,000,000 and at such time as the aggregate amount of payments under
this Section 2.2 shall equal $6,000,000 no further payments shall be made hereunder despite any sales of Jet A Fuel
thereafter.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>(b) As used in Section 2.2, </P>

<P>(i) the "First Year Fuel Threshold" shall equal a sum derived by adding, for each Purchased FBO Facility, (x) the amount
designated for such Purchased FBO Facility in the column "First Year" of Schedule 2.2(b); multiplied by (y) a fraction
where the numerator is the number of days in 2003 starting the day after the date in which the sale of such Purchased FBO
Facility from Seller to Purchaser was consummated and the denominator is 365;</P>

<P>(ii) the "Second Year Fuel Threshold" shall equal the sum of the amounts designated in the column "Second Year" of
Schedule 2.2(b) for each Purchased FBO Facility; and</P>

<P>(iii) the "Third Year Fuel Threshold" shall equal the sum of the amounts designated in the column "Third Year" of
Schedule 2.2(b) for each Purchased FBO Facility.</P>

<P>2.3 Apportionments.</P>

<P>The following items shall be apportioned as of 11:59 p.m., Central Time, on the day of the Closing: (a) real estate and
personal property taxes, sewer rents and charges and other state, county and municipal taxes, any other Taxes that are
imposed on a periodic basis and are payable for a taxable period that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date and
assessments and charges affecting the Business; (b) rents and other payments under any of the Assumed Liabilities; and (c)
charges for water, electricity, gas, oil, steam and all other utilities (except to the extent disposed of by final billing to
Seller), all such items prior to such time being for the account of Seller and all such items after such time being for the
account of Purchaser. At the Closing, Seller or Purchaser, as the case may be, shall deliver to the other a check for the net
amount owing under this section. If any such item cannot accurately be apportioned at the Closing or if it is incorrectly
apportioned at the Closing or subsequent thereto, such items shall be apportioned or reapportioned, as the case may be, as
soon as practicable after the Closing Date or the date on which the apportionment error is discovered, as applicable. Any
amount due as a result of such reapportionment shall be paid within 30 days of the final determination of such amount.</P>

<P>2.4 Allocation of Purchase Price.</P>

<P>With regard to all Taxes, the allocation of the Purchase Price to the Purchased Assets shall be in accordance with their fair
market value and shall be consistent with Section 1060 of the Internal Revenue code of 1986, as amended and the
regulations thereunder (the "Code"). The parties shall use their best efforts prior to Closing to reach an agreement on such
allocation, but such agreement shall not be a condition of the Closing. If no agreement is reached within thirty days after
the Closing, Purchaser shall have the right to refer such matter to a nationally recognized firm of independent public
accountants agreed upon by Purchaser and Seller. The determination made by such firm shall be conclusive and
non-appealable. The fees and disbursements of such firm shall be borne equally by Purchaser and Seller. Seller and
Purchaser shall timely file a Form 8594 with the Internal Revenue Service in connection therewith. For purposes of the
Code, Seller and Purchaser agree to report the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in a manner consistent with
such allocation. In addition, Purchaser and Seller agree to provide each other with their respective Federal Tax
Identification numbers at Closing for purposes of reporting this transaction to the Internal Revenue Service.</P>

<P>2.5 Transaction Related Costs and Taxes.</P>

<P>Seller shall bear costs relating to the assignment of the FBO Lease and obtaining the Estoppel Certificate. The cost of Title
Insurance shall be borne equally by Purchaser and Seller. Seller shall also be responsible for all income and gains Taxes
payable in connection with the transfer of the Business and the Purchased Assets to Purchaser. </P>

<P>2.6 Reserved</P>

<P>2.7 Closing Purchase Price Escrow.</P>

<P>On the Closing Date, Purchaser shall pay the sum of $300,000 (the "Escrow Amount") into an escrow account with a third
party escrow agent reasonably acceptable to Purchaser and Seller (the "Escrow Agent"). The Escrow Amount shall be
available to reimburse Purchaser for (a) the payment of any Excluded Liabilities for which Purchaser may become liable,
(b) reimbursement for any Accounts Receivable which Purchaser reconveys to Seller, (c) any amounts paid to the Secured
Lenders by Purchaser or an Affiliate of Purchaser or from the proceeds of the sale of any assets of Purchaser or any
Affiliate of Purchaser in connection with any default by Seller or any Affiliate of Seller related to any Secured Debt; and
(d) to reserve against any Losses for which any Purchaser Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification by Seller under
the terms of Article 9 of this Agreement (any such reimbursable amount referred to herein as a "Purchaser Reimbursable")
for the period specified in the Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Amount shall be held, administrated and distributed by the
Escrow Agent in accordance with an escrow agreement which shall be executed and delivered by Purchaser, Seller and
Escrow Agent at the Closing in the form of Exhibit B to this Agreement (the "Escrow Agreement"). The Escrow Amount
shall be increased upon payment of the Note in accordance with the terms of the Note.</P>

<P>2.8 Set-Off.</P>

<P>If the Escrow Amount is insufficient to reimburse Purchaser for any Purchaser Reimbursable, the Purchaser shall be
entitled, in addition to any other right or remedy it may have against Seller, to exercise rights of set-off against any amounts
due and payable to Seller under this Agreement or any agreement or instrument executed and delivered by Purchaser or
Seller related to the purchase and sale of the Purchased Assets, including the Note.</P>

<P>2.9 Subordination.</P>

<P>(a) Subordination to Senior Debt. Each of Seller and Purchaser covenants and agrees, that the payment of any and all of the
amounts pursuant to Section 2.2 hereof (the "Subordinated Debt") shall be subordinate and subject in right and time of
payment, to the extent and in the manner hereinafter set forth, to the Payment in Full of all Senior Debt. Each holder of
Senior Debt, whether now outstanding or hereafter created, incurred, assumed or guaranteed, shall be deemed to have
acquired Senior Debt in reliance upon the provisions contained in this Section.</P>

<P>(b) Liquidation, Dissolution, Bankruptcy. In the event of any Proceeding involving Purchaser:</P>

<P>(i) All Senior Debt shall first be Paid in Full before any payment, whether in cash, securities or other property, shall be
made to Seller on account of any Subordinated Debt.</P>

<P>(ii) Any payment, whether in cash, securities or other property which would otherwise, but for the terms hereof, be payable
or deliverable in respect of the Subordinated Debt shall be paid or delivered directly to Agent (to be held and/or applied by
Agent in accordance with the terms of the Senior Debt Documents) until all Senior Debt is Paid in Full.</P>

<P>(iii) Seller agrees not to initiate, prosecute or participate in any claim, action or other proceeding challenging the
enforceability, validity, perfection or priority of the Senior Debt or any liens and security interests securing the Senior Debt.</P>

<P>(iv) Seller agrees to execute, verify, deliver and file any proofs of claim in respect of the Subordinated Debt requested by
Agent in connection with any such Proceeding and hereby irrevocably authorizes, empowers and appoints Agent its agent
and attorney-in-fact to (i) execute, verify, deliver and file such proofs of claim upon the failure of Seller promptly to do so
prior to 10 days before the expiration of the time to file any such proof of claim and (ii) vote such claim in any such
Proceeding upon the failure of Seller to do so prior to 5 days before the expiration of the time to vote any such claim;
provided Agent shall have no obligation to execute, verify, deliver, file and/or vote any such proof of claim. In the event
that Agent votes any claim in accordance with the authority granted hereby, Seller shall not be entitled to change or
withdraw such vote.</P>

<P>(v) The Senior Debt shall continue to be treated as Senior Debt and the provisions of this section shall continue to govern
the relative rights and priorities of Senior Lenders and Seller even if all or part of the Senior Debt or the security interests
securing the Senior Debt are subordinated, set aside, avoided, invalidated or disallowed in connection with any such
Proceeding, and the provisions of this section shall be reinstated if at any time any payment of any of the Senior Debt is
rescinded or must otherwise be returned by any holder of Senior Debt or any representative of such holder.</P>

<P>(c) Subordinated Debt Payment Restrictions.</P>

<P>(i) Purchaser hereby agrees that it may not make, and Seller hereby agrees that it will not accept, (x) at any time, any
prepayment with respect to the Subordinated Debt, and (y) any payment with respect to the Subordinated Debt if, with
respect to this clause (y), at the time of such payment, a Senior Payment Default or Senior Covenant Default exists:</P>

<P>(ii) Purchaser may resume schedule of payments (and may make any payments missed due to the application of paragraph
(c)(i) of this Section 2.9):</P>

<P>(x) in the case of a Senior Payment Default, upon a cure or waiver thereof; or </P>

<P>(y) in the case of a Senior Covenant Default, upon the earlier to occur of (A) the cure or waiver of all such Senior Covenant
Defaults or (B) the expiration of a period of 180 days after the date such scheduled payment was due.</P>

<P>(d) Subordinated Debt Standstill Provisions. Until the Senior Debt is Paid in Full, Seller shall not, without the prior written
consent of Agent, take any Enforcement Action with respect to the Subordinated Debt, until the earliest to occur of the
following and in any event no earlier than ten (10) days after Agent's receipt of written notice of Seller's intention to take
any such Enforcement Action:</P>

<P>(i) acceleration of the Senior Debt; or</P>

<P>(ii) the passage of 180 days from the delivery of a written notice to Agent stating a default has occurred hereunder, if the
default described therein shall not have been cured or waived within such period.</P>

<P>(e) Incorrect Payments. If any payment on account of the Subordinated Debt not permitted to be made by Purchaser or
accepted by Seller pursuant to this Section 2.9 is made and received by Seller, such payment shall not be commingled with
any of the assets of Seller, shall be held in trust by Seller for the benefit of Agent and Senior Lenders and shall be promptly

Assets for which a security interest, mortgage or deed of trust has been granted to such Secured Lender; and (iii) the
aggregate amount of all Secured Debt owed to all of the Secured Lenders as of the date hereof, including accrued interest as

any such Secured Lender to release its security interest, mortgage or deed of trust against the Purchased Assets, or (ii)
Purchaser makes payments to such Secured Lender in excess of the amounts owed to Seller under the Note, Purchaser shall
have the further right to any and all remedies set forth herein (including the rights of set-off and indemnification) or under
any other agreement or document executed among the parties or under the law to recover such additional amounts paid or
any Losses suffered as a result of Seller's breach of the covenant set forth in the first sentence of this Section 2.10(b).</P>

to exercise the Repurchase Option as set forth in this Section 2.11 if Purchaser's failure to pay was permissible pursuant to

Repurchase Option within five business days of the Option Date and shall pay the Repurchase Option Price to Purchaser, or

Upon payment of the Repurchase Option Price in full (the "Option Closing Date") within the permitted time period,
Purchaser shall immediately deliver to Seller Instruments of Conveyance, substantially in the form as provided from Seller
to Purchaser in connection with the purchase of the Purchased Assets hereunder, transferring the Purchased Assets to Seller

2.11 to the contrary, Purchaser shall have the right at any time prior to the Option Closing Date to make the payment due to
Seller under the Note that triggered the Repurchase Option in full and, if Purchaser makes such payment in full to Seller,
then Seller shall have no further rights pursuant to this Section 2.11 with respect to such previous failure to make payment.</P>

<P>(b) As used herein, "Repurchase Option Price" shall mean (i) the sum of (v) One Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars
($1,500,000); (x) all interest and principal payments made to Seller pursuant to the Note prior to the Option Closing Date;

net income earned by Purchaser on the Purchased Assets from the Closing Date through the Option Closing Date calculated
in accordance with GAAP.</P>

<P>(c) Upon the closing of the Repurchase Option, (i) the payment of the Repurchase Option Price shall be deemed to cure any
and all failures to make payments or other defaults or breaches by Purchaser under the Note or this Agreement, and (ii) any
other rights or remedies that Seller may have against Purchaser or any other Person for any such failure, default or breach
under the Note, this Agreement or the Pledge and Security Agreement by and among John Clanton, Trajen FBO, LLC and
Seller shall be null and void as of such date.</P>

<P>ARTICLE 9 </P>

<P>INDEMNIFICATION</P>

<P>9.1 Indemnification by Seller.</P>

<P>Seller agrees to indemnify Purchaser and its officers, managers, partners, employees, affiliates, agents and members (each a
"Purchaser Indemnified Party" and, collectively, the "Purchaser Indemnified Parties") and hold them harmless against any
loss, liability, deficiency, damage, expense or cost and hereby waives and covenants not to bring any claim for contribution
against Purchaser for, all claims and damages (including punitive damages, liabilities, costs, losses, fines, penalties,
demands, cost recovery actions, lawsuits, administrative proceedings, orders, response action costs, compliance costs,
investigation expenses, consultant fees, attorneys' fees and litigation expenses) (each individually, a "Loss" and
collectively, "Losses") that result, either directly or indirectly, from:</P>

<P>(a) any misrepresentation in any of the representations or breach of any of the warranties of Seller contained in this
Agreement or in any agreements, exhibits, schedules, certificates or annexes delivered or to be delivered pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement or otherwise incorporated in this Agreement;</P>

<P>(b) any breach of, or failure to perform, any agreement or covenant of Seller contained in this Agreement including the
failure to comply with the provisions of this Article 9;</P>

<P>(c) any Claims against any of Purchaser Indemnified Parties arising out of the actions or inactions of Seller or the use,
ownership or operation of the Purchased Assets (i) prior to the Closing with respect to the Purchased Assets or the
operation of the Business or (ii) prior to or after the Closing, with respect to any other business of Seller;</P>

<P>(d) any actions, omissions, circumstances or conditions to the extent existing prior to the Closing, which arise under
Environmental Laws or relate to Hazardous Materials, except to the extent Seller demonstrates by a preponderance of the
evidence that such facts, circumstances or conditions (A) did not arise from Seller's operation of the Business or its
occupancy of the Real Property or (B) arose as a result of Purchaser's negligence, non-compliance with applicable Laws,
willful misconduct, operation of the Business or occupation of the Real Property after the Closing Date; or</P>

<P>(e) any Excluded Liabilities;</P>

<P>All of the foregoing items in items (a) - (e) are collectively known as the "Purchaser Losses."</P>

<P>9.2 Indemnification by Purchaser.</P>

<P>Purchaser agrees to indemnify Seller, and its officers, directors, managers, partners, employees, agents, and shareholders
(collectively, the "Seller Indemnified Parties"), and hold them harmless against any Losses that any of the Seller
Indemnified Parties may suffer, sustain or become subject to as a result of (a) any misrepresentation in any of the
representations or breaches of any of the warranties of Purchaser contained in this Agreement, (b) any breach of, or failure
to perform, any agreement or covenant of Purchaser contained in this Agreement, including assuming the Assumed
Liabilities, (c) any Claims against any of the Seller Indemnified Parties arising out of actions or inactions of Purchaser
subsequent to Closing with respect to the Purchased Assets or the operation of the Business subsequent to Closing, or (d)
the Assumed Liabilities (collectively, the "Seller Losses").</P>

<P>9.3 Method of Asserting Claims.</P>

<P>As used herein, an "Indemnified Party" shall refer to a "Purchaser Indemnified Party" or "Seller Indemnified Party," as
applicable, the "Notifying Party" shall refer to the party entitled to indemnification hereunder, and the "Indemnifying Party"
shall refer to the party(ies) hereto obligated to indemnify such Notifying Party's Indemnified Parties.</P>

<P>(a) In the event that any of the Indemnified Parties is made a defendant in or party to any action or proceeding, judicial or
administrative, instituted by any third party, the liabilities for which, or the costs or expenses of which, are Seller Losses or
Purchaser Losses, as the case may be, (any such third party action or proceeding being referred to as a "Claim"), the
Notifying Party shall give the Indemnifying Party prompt notice thereof. The failure to give such notice shall not affect any
Indemnified Party's ability to seek reimbursement except to the extent such failure adversely affects the Indemnifying
Party's ability to defend successfully a Claim. The Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to contest and defend such Claim;
provided, that the Indemnifying Party diligently contests and defends such Claim. Such defense shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Party of its liability under this Article 9 for any Loss to the Notifying Party relating to such Claim. Notice of
the intention to contest and defend shall be given by the Indemnifying Party to the Notifying Party within 15 business days
after the Notifying Party's notice of such Claim (but in all events as soon as possible prior to the date such Claim is due to
be filed). Such contest and defense shall be conducted by competent counsel employed by the Indemnifying Party. The
Notifying Party shall be entitled at any time, at its own cost and expense (which expense shall not constitute a Loss unless
the Notifying Party reasonably determines that the Indemnifying Party is not adequately representing the interest of the
Indemnified Parties), to participate in such contest and defense and to be represented by attorneys of its or their own
choosing. If the Notifying Party elects to participate in such defense, the Notifying Party shall cooperate with the
Indemnifying Party in the conduct of such defense. Neither the Notifying Party nor the Indemnifying Party may concede,
settle or compromise any Claim without the consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the Indemnifying Party fails or is not entitled to contest and defend a
Claim, the Notifying Party shall be entitled to contest, defend and settle such Claim in such manner and on such terms as
the Notifying Party may deem appropriate and the Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the Losses of the Notifying Party
in accordance with the provisions of this Article 9.</P>

<P>(b) In the event any Indemnified Party should have a claim against any Indemnifying Party that does not involve a Claim,
the Notifying Party shall deliver a notice of such claim with reasonable promptness to the Indemnifying Party. </P>

<P>9.4 Limits on Indemnification.</P>

<P>With respect to any Claims arising under Section 9.1(a) or 9.2(a), the Indemnified Party shall not be entitled to
indemnification until the aggregate Losses, suffered by such party, or its successors and assigns, in connection with any
breach of this Agreement exceeds $50,000 (the "Basket"), whereupon, the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
indemnification hereunder from the Indemnifying Party for the aggregate Losses suffered including the amount of the
Basket. With respect to any such claims arising under Section 9.1(a) or 9.2(a), no Indemnifying Party shall be liable for
indemnification under this Article for amounts in the aggregate, exceeding the Purchase Price (the "Indemnification Cap").</P>

<P>9.5 Survival.</P>

<P>The representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement or in any writing delivered to Purchaser or Seller in
connection with this Agreement shall survive the Closing Date for a period of three (3) years; provided however, that the
representations and warranties contained in Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 shall survive without termination and the
representations and warranties contained in Sections 3.6, 3.7, 3.9, 3.12 (solely with respect to unfair labor practices and the
conformance of Seller's current procedures, policies and training practices with applicable laws, ordinances, regulations and
other governmental requirements), 3.13, 3.15 and 3.16 shall survive until the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations. </P>

<P>9.6 Sole Remedy.</P>

<P>Except in the case of fraud or intentional misrepresentation, the provisions and procedures set forth in this Article 9 shall
constitute the Parties' exclusive rights and remedies for any breach of this Agreement.</P>

<P>9.7 Tax Treatment and Indemnity Payments.</P>

<P>All indemnification payments made under this Agreement shall be treated as purchase price adjustments for Tax purposes.</P>

<P>ARTICLE 10 </P>

<P>(d) by written notice from Purchaser to Seller (provided that if Purchaser does not terminate this Agreement for any
condition set forth below within the period described for such condition, such condition shall be deemed waived as a
condition to Closing):</P>
