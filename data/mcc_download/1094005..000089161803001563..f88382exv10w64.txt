offered or resold except pursuant to registration under the Securities Act or an
available exemption from registration. All certificates representing such
Purchaser Ordinary Shares shall bear, in addition to any other legends required
under applicable securities laws, the following legend:

            "The shares represented by this certificate have not been registered
            under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"),
            and may not be transferred except pursuant to registration under the

represented by such certificate have been registered under the Securities Act or
otherwise as appropriate. In order to prevent any transfer from taking place in
violation of this Agreement or applicable law, the Purchaser may, in its
reasonable discretion, cause a stop transfer order to be placed with its
transfer agent(s) with respect to the Purchaser Ordinary Shares.

            SECTION 2.06. ADJUSTMENT TO THE DEFERRED CONSIDERATION. In the event
that the Operating Benchmark is determined pursuant to Section 6.16 to be less
than 2,000,000 (such shortfall, being the "SHORTFALL"), (a) the total amount of
the Deferred Cash Consideration (in the case of the Management Shareholders)

representations and warranties of the Company or a Shareholder contained in this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements shall survive the Closing until the first
anniversary of the Closing Date; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that (i) the representations
and warranties made pursuant to Sections 3.01, 3.02, 3.03, 3.04, 3.05, 3.15,

statutory of limitations with respect to the Tax liabilities in question.
Neither the period of survival nor the liability of the Company and the
Shareholders with respect to the Company's and the Shareholder's representations
and warranties shall be reduced by any investigation made at any time by or on
behalf of the Purchaser. If written notice of a claim has been given prior to
the expiration of the applicable representations and warranties by the Purchaser
to the Company, then the relevant representations and warranties shall survive
as to such claim, until such claim has been finally resolved.

            SECTION 8.02. INDEMNIFICATION BY THE SHAREHOLDERS. (a) The Purchaser
and its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents, successors and
assigns (each a "PURCHASER INDEMNIFIED PARTY") shall be indemnified and held
harmless by the Shareholders, jointly and severally, for and against any and all
Liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs and expenses actually suffered or
incurred by them (including, without limitation, any Action brought or otherwise
initiated by any of them) (hereinafter a "LOSS"), arising out of or resulting
from:

            (i) the breach of any representation or warranty made by the Company
      or a Shareholder or a Transferor under any of the Equity Transfer
      Agreements contained in the Acquisition Documents (it being understood
      that such representations and warranties shall be interpreted without
      giving effect to any limitations or qualifications as to "materiality"
      (including the word "material") or "Material Adverse Effect" set forth
      therein); or

            (ii) the breach of any covenant or agreement by the Company or a
      Shareholder or a Transferor under any of the Equity Transfer Agreements
      contained in the Acquisition Documents;

PROVIDED, that the sum of all Losses subject to this Section 8.02 shall exceed
US$700,000 before Purchaser shall be entitled to recover any Loss, and then to
the extent such Loss exceeds US$700,000; PROVIDED, FURTHER, that the total
liability of the Shareholders for indemnification hereunder shall not exceed 25%
of the Aggregate Purchase Price; and PROVIDED, FURTHER, HOWEVER, that the
limitation on total liability of the Shareholders for indemnification set forth
in this Section 8.02 shall not apply in respect of any Loss arising out of or
resulting from fraud committed by any of the Shareholders, the Company, the
Company Subsidiaries or the Related Entities prior to the Closing. To the extent
that the Shareholders' undertakings set forth in this Section 8.02 may be
unenforceable, the Shareholders shall contribute the maximum amount that it is
permitted to contribute under applicable Law to the payment and satisfaction of
all Losses incurred by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties.

            (b) A Purchaser Indemnified Party shall give the Shareholders notice
of any matter which a Purchaser Indemnified Party has reasonably determined has
given or could give rise to a right of indemnification under this Agreement,
within 60 days of such determination, stating the amount of the Loss, if known,
and method of computation thereof, and containing a reference to the provisions
of this Agreement in respect of which such right of indemnification is claimed
or arises. The obligations and Liabilities of the Shareholders under this
Article VIII with respect to Losses arising from claims of any third party which
are subject to the indemnification provided for in this Article VIII ("THIRD
PARTY CLAIMS") shall be governed by and be contingent upon the following
additional terms and conditions: if a Purchaser Indemnified


                                       40
<PAGE>

Party shall receive notice of any Third Party Claim, the Purchaser Indemnified
Party shall give the Shareholders notice of such Third Party Claim within 30
days of the receipt by the Purchaser Indemnified Party of such notice; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that the failure to provide such notice shall not release the
Shareholders from any of their obligations under this Article VIII except to the
extent that the Shareholders are materially prejudiced by such failure and shall
not relieve the Shareholders from any other obligation or Liability that it may
have to any Purchaser Indemnified Party otherwise than under this Article VIII.
If the Shareholders acknowledge in writing its obligation to indemnify the
Purchaser Indemnified Party hereunder against any Losses that may result from
such Third Party Claim, then the Shareholders shall be entitled to assume and
control the defense of such Third Party Claim at their expense and through
counsel of its choice if it gives notice of its intention to do so to the
Purchaser Indemnified Party within five days of the receipt of such notice from
the Purchaser Indemnified Party; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if there exists or is
reasonably likely to exist a conflict of interest that would make it
inappropriate in the judgment of the Purchaser Indemnified Party in its sole and
absolute discretion for the same counsel to represent both the Purchaser
Indemnified Party and the Shareholders, then the Purchaser Indemnified Party
shall be entitled to retain its own counsel in each jurisdiction for which the
Purchaser Indemnified Party determines counsel is required, at the expense of
the Shareholders. In the event that the Shareholders exercise the right to
undertake any such defense against any such Third Party Claim as provided above,
the Purchaser Indemnified Party shall cooperate with the Shareholders in such
defense and make available to the Shareholders, at the Shareholders' expense,
all witnesses, pertinent records, materials and information in the Purchaser
Indemnified Party's possession or under the Purchaser Indemnified Party's
control relating thereto as is reasonably required by the Shareholders.
Similarly, in the event the Purchaser Indemnified Party is, directly or
indirectly, conducting the defense against any such Third Party Claim, the
Shareholders shall cooperate with the Purchaser Indemnified Party in such
defense and make available to the Purchaser Indemnified Party, at the
Shareholders' expense, all such witnesses, records, materials and information in
the Shareholders' possession or under the Shareholders' control relating thereto
as is reasonably required by the Purchaser Indemnified Party. No such Third
Party Claim may be settled by the Shareholders without the prior written consent
of the Purchaser Indemnified Party.

other parties contained herein or in any document delivered by the other parties
pursuant hereto or (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements of the other
parties or conditions to such parties' obligations contained herein. Any such

shall not be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach or a subsequent
waiver of the same term or condition, or a waiver of any other term or condition
of this Agreement. The failure of any party to assert any of its rights
hereunder shall not constitute a waiver of any of such rights. All rights and
remedies existing under this Agreement are cumulative to, and not exclusive of,
any rights or remedies otherwise available.
