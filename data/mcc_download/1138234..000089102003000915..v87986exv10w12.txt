                                 AMENDMENT NO. 1
                         TO AT&T WIRELESS SERVICES, INC.
                          2001 LONG TERM INCENTIVE PLAN

The second paragraph of Section 13 of the AT&T Wireless Services, Inc. 2001 Long
Term Incentive Plan shall be amended in its entirety to read as follows:

            The Board or the Committee may amend, alter, suspend, discontinue or
      terminate the Plan or any portion thereof at any time; provided, however,
      that no such amendment, alteration, suspension, discontinuation or
      termination shall be made without (a) stockholder approval if such
      approval is necessary to qualify for or comply with any tax or regulatory
      requirement for which or with which the Board deems it necessary or
      desirable to qualify or comply or (b) the consent of the affected
      Participant, if such action would impair the rights of such Participant
      under any outstanding Award. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
      herein, (x) the Board or the Committee may amend the Plan in such manner
      as may be necessary so as to have the Plan conform to local rules and
      regulations in any jurisdiction outside the United States and (y) the
      Committee may not amend Section 4 to increase the number of Shares
      available for issuance under the Plan.
