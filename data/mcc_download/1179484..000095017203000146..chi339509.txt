                  This is an Agreement dated as of April 2, 2002 among General
Electric Capital Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Purchaser"), among
Comdisco, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Comdisco") and Comdisco Healthcare
Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("CHG", each of CHG and Comdisco, a "Seller"
and collectively, the "Sellers"), each of which agrees as follows:

                                    Recitals

                  WHEREAS, the Sellers and certain of their affiliates, have
filed voluntary petitions (the "Petitions") for relief commencing cases (the
"Chapter 11 Cases") under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the United States Code (the
"Bankruptcy Code") in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern
District of Illinois (the "Bankruptcy Court");

                  WHEREAS, Purchaser and the Purchaser Affiliates (as
hereinafter defined) desire to purchase and acquire, and the Sellers desire to
sell, convey, assign and transfer to Purchaser and the Purchaser Affiliates, the
Purchased Assets (as hereinafter defined), and Purchaser and the Purchaser
Affiliates are willing to assume, and the Sellers desire to assign and delegate
to Purchaser and the Purchaser Affiliates, the Assumed Liabilities (as
hereinafter defined), all in the manner and subject to the terms and conditions
set forth herein and in accordance with Sections 105, 363 and 365 of the
Bankruptcy Code, where applicable.

                  NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises and
covenants contained herein and intending to be legally bound, Purchaser and the
Sellers do hereby agree as follows:

                                    Agreement

                                   ARTICLE I

                                   DEFINITIONS

                  Capitalized terms used in this Agreement shall have the
following meanings:

                  1.1 Definitions.

                  "Accounting Principles" shall mean the accounting principles
(including accounting methods, practices and procedures) set forth on Schedule
1.1A. When the accounting principles (including accounting methods, practices
and procedures) set forth on Schedule 1.1A do not specifically address a
particular matter necessary to prepare the Closing Date Schedule of Assets
Acquired and Liabilities Assumed, then the accounting principles (including
accounting methods, practices and procedures) set forth on Schedule 1.1A shall
be supplemented in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting
principles applied consistently with the past practices and procedures of the
applicable Seller in connection with the Purchased Assets or the Assumed
Liabilities (as applicable), but only to the extent necessary to address such
matter. To the extent that an accounting principle, method, practice or
procedure set forth on Schedule 1.1A is not in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles as applicable in the United States, such
accounting principle, method, practice or procedure set forth on Schedule 1.1A
shall be disregarded for purposes of preparing the Closing Date Schedule of
Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed but shall be treated as a Special
Adjustment.

                  "Adjusted Closing Date Schedule of Assets Acquired and
Liabilities Assumed" shall mean a schedule of assets acquired and liabilities
assumed, prepared by adjusting the Closing Date Schedule of Assets Acquired and
Liabilities Assumed to the Special Adjustments, which shall be described in
reasonable detail therein.

                  "Advance Payment" shall mean, in respect of any Purchased
Financing Contract, any security deposit or other payment that was received as
collateral or security, or any advance rent received that would be reflected as
"deferred income" on a balance sheet of each Seller prepared in accordance with
the Accounting Principles by any Seller on or prior to the Closing Date in
respect of such Purchased Financing Contract.

                  "Affiliate" shall mean, with respect to any Person, any other
Person that directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controls,
or is controlled by, or is under common control with, such Person. With respect

Capital Services, Inc. and any Person that directly or indirectly through one or
more intermediaries, controls, or is controlled by, or is under common control
with, General Electric Capital Services, Inc.

                  "Agreement" shall mean this Asset Purchase Agreement,
including the Schedules attached hereto and made a part hereof, as the same may

or performed from and after the applicable Closing, (ii) all obligations under
the Purchased Other Contracts arising from and after the applicable Closing,
(iii) all obligations under the Purchased Discounted Financing Agreements

any Seller thereunder, (iv) all accounts payable related to the Purchased
Financing Contracts required to be paid from and after the applicable Closing,
and (v) all obligations (including, without limitation, residual sharing
obligations) under the Purchased Financing Contract required to be paid or
performed from and after the applicable Closing. For the avoidance of doubt,
Assumed Liabilities shall not include any other obligations or liabilities of
any Seller (including, without limitation, any cure amounts payable to other
parties to the agreements, contracts, and commitments referenced in this
definition of Assumed Liabilities).

                  "Authorization" shall mean any domestic or foreign, federal,
state, provincial, local or other governmental or other quasi-governmental
consent, license, permit, grant, authorization or approval, including but not
limited to any consent, license, permit, grant, authorization or approval of any

initial Closing and any subsequent Closings permitted pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement. The initial Closing Date is expected to occur on May 31, 2002 or
such later date as shall be fixed by agreement among the parties hereto. The

any Financing Contract and has irrevocably notified Comdisco in writing that

Financing Contract shall be deemed a Purchased Financing Contract, provided,
however, that in each case, prior to the Closing Date, Purchaser receives, to

(E) of the definition of "Purchased Financing Contracts" and Lease Confirmations
set forth in clause (H)(y) of the definition of "Purchased Financing Contracts";
provided, further, (i) in the event such notice is given with respect to a
Financing Contract with an Obligor that has multiple Financing Contracts with

For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this definition shall be deemed to

         Payment, and (B) the Settlement Interest; or

                  (ii) if the Initial Payment exceeds the Purchase Price, the
         Sellers shall pay to Purchaser or Purchaser Affiliate, as applicable,
         an aggregate amount equal to the sum of (A) the Settlement Payment, and
         (B) the Settlement Interest.

the Purchased Assets) arises on or prior to the Closing Date (or the date of the
Second Closing with respect to Purchased Financing Contracts transferred at the
Second Closing) irrespective of the reporting and payment dates of such Taxes.
Each Seller shall be responsible for all other Taxes as levied by any foreign,
federal, state or local taxing authority in any jurisdiction with respect to the
ownership, use or leasing of the Purchased Assets for all periods (or portions
thereof) on or prior to the Closing Date (or the date of the Second Closing with
respect to Purchased Financing Contracts transferred at the Second Closing), and
Purchaser shall be responsible for all such Taxes with respect to the ownership,
use or leasing of the Purchased Assets for all periods (or portions thereof)
after the Closing Date (or the date of the Second Closing with respect to
Purchased Financing Contracts transferred at the Second Closing). All payments
to be made by Sellers in accordance with this Section 2.5 shall be made, to the
extent then determinable, at the Closing (or the date of the Second Closing with
respect to Purchased Financing Contracts transferred at the Second Closing) with
such payments deposited into escrow until due, or, to the extent not
determinable as of the Closing (or the date of the Second Closing with respect
to Purchased Financing Contracts transferred at the Second Closing), promptly
following the determination thereof, with such payments deposited into escrow
pursuant to Section 2.6 until due. Purchaser shall have the right of review and
approval of each Seller's property Tax Returns and assessments and the right to
contest any assessment for which Purchaser may be adversely affected. Each
Seller shall cooperate with Purchaser to advance any contest.

                  2.6 Tax Escrow. The amount of any personal property, ad
valorem, sales, use, transfer, recording or similar Tax liability, or any other
Taxes required to be withheld by any taxing authority, relating to the Purchased
Assets for which the Sellers are responsible pursuant to Section 2.5 and Section
5.3(c) and which are unpaid or not yet due and payable as of the Closing (or the
date of the Second Closing with respect to Purchased Financing Contracts
transferred at the Second Closing) shall be estimated in good faith by the
mutual agreement of Comdisco and Purchaser and a portion of the Purchase Price
which is no less than such amount shall be put by the Sellers into escrow at
Closing (or at the Second Closing with respect to Purchased Financing Contracts
transferred at the Second Closing) and such amount shall be held and used for
the sole purpose of discharging and releasing any such Taxes with respect to the
Purchased Assets pursuant to Section 5.13; provided, however that if Purchaser
and the Sellers have not agreed on the portion of the Purchase Price to be
deposited into escrow pursuant to this Section 2.6 at least 20 days prior to the
Closing (or 20 days prior to the Second Closing with respect to the Purchased
Financing Contracts to be transferred at the Second Closing), such dispute will
be resolved by KPMG LLP or any other public accounting firm with nationally
accepted auditing experience as mutually agreed upon by Purchaser and Comdisco.
The escrow to be established pursuant to this Section 2.6 shall be established
pursuant to, an escrow agreement mutually acceptable to Purchaser and Comdisco
or such other arrangement as may be mutually agreed by Purchaser and Comdisco
prior to the Closing. The escrow shall not include any unpaid Taxes which are
reimbursable or payable by an Obligor under any Purchased Financing Contract
except to the extent that the Sellers previously collected such Taxes from the
Obligor.

                  3.25 [Intentionally Omitted.]

                  3.26 Purchased Discounted Financing Agreements. No Purchased
Discounted Financing Agreement (i) except as set forth on Schedule 3.26,
provides that the lender thereunder has recourse against any person for the
payment thereunder except the Obligor of the Financing Contract securing such
indebtedness, (ii) except as set forth on Schedule 3.26, has an amount due in
excess of the remaining rent payments under the Financing Contract securing such
indebtedness, (iii) allows the lender to retain its security interest in the
Financing Contract securing such indebtedness after the repayment of such
indebtedness, (iv) is cross collateralized to any Property other than any
Purchased Financing Contract which was discounted for such indebtedness and its
underlying Portfolio Property, (v) except as set forth on Schedule 3.26 has a
lender located, or payments due, outside of the United States, (vi) has a cross
default to any other agreement, (vii) has a representation or covenant which has
been breached by any Seller, which would give (with the giving of notice or
passage of time or both) the lender thereunder the ability to accelerate payment
to become due thereunder, (viii) would prohibit Purchaser or any Purchaser
Affiliate from receiving payments on the Financing Contract securing such
indebtedness after such indebtedness is paid in full, or (ix) gives a right of
setoff to the lender for any amounts owed thereunder. Each Purchased Discounted
Financing Agreement is substantially in the same form as the Discounted
Financing Agreements set forth on Schedule 3.26. Schedule 3.26 sets forth all
Discounted Financing Agreements to which any Seller is a party.

                                   ARTICLE V

                        CONDUCT AND TRANSACTIONS PRIOR TO
                         CLOSING; COVENANTS; INDEMNITIES

                  Each Seller agrees and covenants with Purchaser as follows:

                  5.1 Investigations; Certain Covenants. Between the date of the
Approval Order and the Closing (or, with respect to Sections

                  5.1(a), 5.1(b), 5.1(c) and 5.1(d), during the period set forth
therein):

                  (a) Within six (6) Business Days after the date of this
Agreement, the Sellers shall give or cause to be given to Purchaser and its
representatives and agents reasonable access during normal business hours and
upon reasonable prior notice to all the Sellers' premises in Rosemont, Illinois,
personnel and books and records (located in Rosemont, Illinois) of each Seller,
including, but not limited to, all accounting books and records, all financial
records and statements, and all Tax Returns and Tax records, in each case
pertaining to any Purchased Financing Contract, any Portfolio Property or any
Assumed Liability, or any other Purchased Asset; provided, however, in the event
any book and records of any Seller pertaining to any Purchased Asset or Assumed
Liability is not located at Sellers' premises in Rosemont, Illinois, copies of
such book and records shall be made available at Sellers' premises in Rosemont,
Illinois. Within six (6) Business Days after the date of this Agreement but in
no event earlier than April 10, 2002, the Sellers shall use their reasonable
best efforts to assemble, and make available for Purchaser's review, at the
Sellers' offices in Rosemont, Illinois, a lease file for each Purchased
Financing Contract (each, a "Lease File"), which shall contain, to the extent in
the possession of any Seller, the credit file, the correspondence file, the
document file and the documents set forth on Schedule 5.1(a), each organized so
that all such documents relating to a specific Purchased Financing Contract are
located in a single Lease File. Each Seller shall use its reasonable best
efforts to assemble originals or copies, to the extent in the possession of any
Seller, in the Lease File for each Financing Contract intended to be included in
the Purchased Financing Contracts, of the credit file, the correspondence file,
the document file and the documents set forth on Schedule 5.1(a); provided,
however, the Sellers shall deliver original master leases (or, if not in the
Sellers' possession, copies of such master leases, if such master leases are the
subject of a Purchased Discounted Financing Agreement, certified as true,
correct and complete by an officer of the applicable Seller and in all other
cases by the applicable Obligor), original applicable schedules, original Credit
Enhancements and original confirmations of filings of all UCC financing
statements (or if not in the Sellers' possession, a copy thereof). Purchaser and
the Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to observe and comply with
the review procedures and processes set forth on Schedule 5.1(a).

                  (b) As soon as practicable following the date of the Approval
Order, each of Purchaser and each Seller shall make or cause to be made all
filings required to be made by it or on its behalf under the HSR Act and any
corresponding anti-trust, competition or similar legislation in any other
jurisdictions relating to the transactions contemplated hereby and shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause an early termination under the waiting
period under the HSR Act (and to obtain the requisite approvals or consents of
Governmental Entities and to cause any applicable waiting periods to expire
pursuant to the laws of any other jurisdictions) as soon as practicable.
However, neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates shall have any obligation
to dispose of, hold separate or otherwise restrict its enjoyment of any of its
assets or properties (including, without limitation, after the Closing, the
Purchased Assets). Purchaser shall pay the filing fees for all filings required
pursuant to this Section 5.1(b).

                  (c) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement,
between the date of this Agreement and Closing, each Seller shall use
commercially reasonable efforts under the circumstances to preserve
substantially intact the Purchased Assets and shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts under the circumstances to preserve its present business
relationships, including, but not limited to, those with the Obligors under
Financing Contracts, where the discontinuance of such relationships would have a
Material Adverse Effect.

                  (d) Except as otherwise expressly permitted by this Agreement
or consented to in writing by Purchaser and except as prohibited by the
Bankruptcy Code or the Bankruptcy Court in the Chapter 11 Cases prior to the
date hereof, each Seller shall, between the date of this Agreement and Closing:

                  (i) own, operate and service the Purchased Assets and act with
         respect to the Assumed Liabilities, in the ordinary and usual course
         consistent with past practices; provided, that, any Seller may prepay
         any of its indebtedness if such prepayment does not otherwise violate
         any provision of this Agreement except that no Seller shall prepay any
         Discounted Financing Agreement related to a Purchased Financing
         Contract;

                  (ii) maintain its books, accounts and records relating to the
         Purchased Assets in the ordinary course of business consistent with
         past practices, and cause such books, accounts and records to be true
         and complete in all material respects;

                  (iii) [Intentionally Omitted.]

                  (iv) [Intentionally Omitted.]

                  (v) use commercially reasonable efforts to keep available the
         services of the present employees necessary to maintain (without
         deterioration in any material respect) its business as such business
         relates to the Purchased Assets; and

                  (vi) use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the
         goodwill associated with its business, as such business relates to the
         Purchased Assets, including, without limitation, preserving the
         relationship of customers, suppliers and others having business
         dealings with any Seller.

                  Except as otherwise expressly permitted by this Agreement,
between the date of this Agreement and Closing, no Seller, without the written
consent of Purchaser, shall, with respect to any of the Purchased Assets:

                           (A) waive or commit to waive any right that could
                  have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
                  Effect;

                           (B) with respect to the Healthcare Segment, modify
                  the policies or practices for (x) evaluating, originating,
                  underwriting or funding business, (y) collection, or (z)
                  valuing Portfolio Property;

                           (C) [Intentionally Omitted];

                           (D) make any advance, novation, modification or other
                  accommodation (other than those described in clause (A) above)
                  to any Obligor or provider of a Credit Enhancement other than
                  in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
                  practices;

                           (E) except as required by any debtor-in-possession
                  financing in the Chapter 11 Cases, mortgage, pledge or
                  otherwise encumber any assets;

                           (F) sell, lease (other than leases or conditional
                  sales of Portfolio Property pursuant to the Financing
                  Contracts), transfer or otherwise dispose of any assets
                  included in the Purchased Assets, except sales of inventory in
                  the ordinary course of business consistent with past
                  practices;

                           (G) [Intentionally Omitted];

                           (H) make any change in financial or tax accounting
                  methods, principles or practices applicable to the Purchased
                  Assets or Assumed Liabilities unless permitted by the
                  Accounting Principles;

                           (I) [Intentionally Omitted];

                           (J) take any action that would breach any Seller's
                  representations, warranties or covenants contained in this
                  Agreement if such representation, warranty or covenant were
                  made at the time of the action;

                           (K) with respect to any Financing Contract of a type
                  that would be included within the definition of Purchased
                  Financing Contracts (without considering clauses (E) or (H) of
                  the proviso thereof) (a "Non-Terminable or Modifiable
                  Financing Contract"), (x) terminate, or permit the termination
                  of such Financing Contract prior to the expiration of the
                  scheduled term thereof (except for terminations, without a
                  violation of clause (z) below, at the election of an Obligor
                  as contractually permitted under such Financing Contract), (y)
                  directly or indirectly extend or otherwise restructure the
                  payment schedule or payment terms of any such Financing
                  Contract beyond 30 days from the original due date of a
                  payment, or extend or otherwise restructure any other term or
                  condition of any such Financing Contract (except modifications
                  or amendments to reflect equipment additions or upgrades and
                  lease term extensions related to such additions or upgrades),
                  or (z) encourage or induce an Obligor under such Financing
                  Contract to elect to terminate such Financing Contract prior
                  to the expiration of the scheduled term thereof; or

                           (L) enter into an agreement, contract or commitment
                  (other than this Agreement) to do any of the things prohibited

                  (i) (A) any Seller may, during the period from December 31,
         2001 to but excluding April 1, 2002, (1) sell, transfer or otherwise
         dispose of, or enter into an agreement to sell, transfer or otherwise
         dispose of, any Portfolio Property or Financing Contract (selling,
         transferring, disposing of or entering into an agreement to sell,
         transfer or dispose of any Portfolio Property or Financing Contract
         being referred to as a "Sale") or (2) directly or indirectly extend or

         terms or conditions of any Purchased Financing Contract, or make any
         other extension, modification or other accommodation to any Obligor
         (any such modification of a Purchased Financing Contract being referred
         to as a "Modification"); provided, however, that the sum of (x) the
         aggregate Net Book Value as of the date of this Agreement of Portfolio
         Property and Financing Contracts that are Sold pursuant to clause (1)
         above and (y) the aggregate Net Book Value as of the date of this
         Agreement of Purchased Financing Contracts that have been subject to
         Modification pursuant to clause (2) above shall not exceed $7,000,000.
         Sellers agree to deliver to Purchaser on or prior to April 30, 2002, a
         schedule containing a true, correct and complete list of all Sales and
         Modifications entered into by the Sellers from December 31, 2001 to but
         excluding April 1, 2002.

                           (B) In the event any Seller Sells any Portfolio
                  Property or any Financing Contract in accordance with clause
                  (A) above, such Portfolio Property and/or Financing Contract
                  shall constitute an Excluded Asset for purposes hereof (and
                  consequently such Portfolio Property and Financing Contract
                  shall be excluded from the Closing Date Portfolio Tape and the
                  Adjusted Closing Date Schedule of Assets Acquired and
                  Liabilities Assumed and such Seller shall be entitled to the
                  proceeds of such Sale (irrespective of whether such Sale is
                  effected prior, on or after the Closing).

                           (C) In the event any Modification is made to any
                  Purchased Financing Contract in accordance with clause (A)
                  above, the Net Book Value for such Purchased Financing
                  Contract set forth on the Closing Date PortfolioTape shall
                  give effect to such Modification.

                  (ii) (A) Each Seller may, between April 1, 2002 and the
         applicable Cut-Off Date with respect to any Financing Contract, (1)
         Sell any Financing Contract or (2) make a Modification to any Purchased
         Financing Contract; provided, however, that a copy of a definitive
         agreement with respect to such Sale or Modification shall have been
         furnished to Purchaser on or prior to the Cut-Off Date; and, provided,
         further, that the sum of (x) the aggregate Net Book Value as of the
         date of this Agreement of Portfolio Property and Financing Contracts
         that are the subject of a Sale pursuant to clause (1) above and (y) the
         aggregate Net Book Value as of the date of this Agreement of Purchased
         Financing Contracts that have been subject to Modification pursuant to
         clause (2) above shall not, if taken together, exceed (i) $7,500,000
         with respect to the Sales or Modifications that are effected pursuant
         to definitive agreements that are executed on or after April 1, 2002
         but prior to May 31, 2002 and (ii) $10,000,000 with respect to Sales or
         Modifications that are effected pursuant to the definitive agreements
         that are executed on or after May 31, 2002 but prior to June 30, 2002
         (minus the aggregate Net Book Value with respect to the Sales and
         Modifications that are effected pursuant to the definitive Agreements
         that are executed on or after April 1, 2002 but prior to May 31, 2002).

                           (B) In the event any Seller Sells any Portfolio
                  Property or any Financing Contract in accordance with clause
                  (A) above, such Portfolio Property and/or Financing Contract
                  shall constitute an Excluded Asset for purposes hereof (and
                  consequently such Portfolio Property and Financing Contract
                  shall be excluded from the Closing Date Portfolio Tape and the
                  Adjusted Closing Date Schedule of Assets Acquired and
                  Liabilities Assumed and such Seller shall be entitled to the
                  proceeds of such Sale (irrespective of whether such Sale is
                  effected prior, on or after the Closing)).

                           (C) In the event any Modification is made to any
                  Purchased Financing Contract in accordance with clause (A)
                  above, the Net Book Value for such Purchased Financing
                  Contract set forth on the Closing Date Portfolio Tape shall
                  give effect to such Modification.

                  (iii) after the Cut-Off Date with respect to any Financing
         Contract, no Seller shall directly or indirectly in any way enter into
         any Sale or any Modification with respect any Purchased Financing
         Contract, or make any advance or novation to any Obligor or provider of
         a Credit Enhancement thereunder or issue any quotes for any Sale of any
         Portfolio Property subject to such Purchased Financing Contract without
         prior written consent of Purchaser.

                  (f) Each Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain (i) all Authorizations, consents and approvals referred to in Section 3.4
hereof and (ii) the written consent, and any required novation, of the required
third parties to transfer the Required Consent Financing Contracts to Purchaser,
or any Purchaser Affiliate designated by Purchaser, at the Closing.

                  (g) Prior to Closing but after the signing of the Approval
Order by the Bankruptcy Court, and for a period not to exceed four months
following the Closing Date, each Seller shall, reasonably cooperate with
Purchaser and each Purchaser Affiliate by providing reasonable access (during
normal business hours) to (subject to a non-disclosure agreement), (i) available
information regarding, and (ii) available personnel who are knowledgeable
regarding, the systems, hardware and software used by the Seller to collect,
service and operate the Purchased Assets as and to the extent reasonably
requested by Purchaser solely in connection with the conversion of data with
respect to the Purchased Financing Contracts onto the systems, hardware and
software of the Purchaser or applicable Purchaser Affiliate. Effective as of the
Closing Date, each Seller hereby grants to Purchaser and each Purchaser
Affiliate, to the extent owned by any Seller, a perpetual, royalty free,
non-transferable, non-exclusive license (in the jurisdictions in which the
applicable grantor has such rights) to use all information provided under this
Section 5.1(g) (the "Information") solely for their internal business purposes
related to the Purchased Financing Contracts. "Information" shall not include
any computer programs, including, but not limited to, any and all software
implementations of algorithms, models and methodologies in source code or object
code form, databases and compilations. Purchaser and the Purchaser Affiliates
may not rent, lease, sublicense or otherwise transfer any of the Information or
provide access to the Information to any third party. All rights in the
Information not explicitly granted under this Section 5.1(g) are reserved.

                  (h) (i) Approximately five Business Days prior to any Cut-Off
Date intended to be established by Purchaser with respect to any Financing
Contract, Purchaser shall provide a preliminary non-binding list of Financing
Contracts with respect to which Purchaser has completed its review of the Lease
Files and, subject to the conditions set forth in the definition of the "Cut-Off
Date" and the receipt of the listing set forth in clause (ii) below, Purchaser
proposes to issue a notice on the Cut-Off Date.

                  (ii) Two Business Days prior to the proposed Cut-Off Date,
         each Seller shall deliver to Purchaser listings as of such date of all
         Financing Contracts identified by Purchaser pursuant to clause (i)
         above on a non-binding basis as proposed to be included in the notice
         to be issued on the Cut-Off Date that fall under the definition of
         Purchased Financing Contracts (without giving effect to clauses (B),
         (D), (E), (F), (H)(z) or (K) of the proviso in the definition thereof)
         and that either (x) fall under any of clauses (B), (D), (F) or (K) of
         the proviso in the definition of Purchased Financing Contracts, (y)
         fall under clause (i) of the definition of Delinquency Contracts or (z)
         to Seller's Knowledge, do not satisfy the representations and
         warranties of Article III (which listing shall identify the breach of
         such representations and warranties).

                  (iii) Five Business Days prior to Closing, each Seller shall
         deliver to Purchaser a listing of all Financing Contracts with respect
         to which Purchaser has given a notice to Seller on the Cut-Off Date
         electing to deem such Financing Contract a "Purchased Financing
         Contract" that fall under clause (E) of the proviso in the definition
         of Purchased Financing Contracts.

                  (i) Each Seller shall deliver to Purchaser, at least five
Business Days prior to Closing, all Environmental Reports that come to its
possession, custody or control between the date hereof and Closing.

                  (j) Within 20 days after the date of the Approval Order, each
Seller shall deliver to Purchaser or the applicable Purchaser Affiliate a list
of all third party consents required to transfer each Purchased Other Contract.
Each Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such
consents prior to Closing. To the extent that any Seller does not obtain such
consents prior to Closing for a Purchased Other Contract, Purchaser may elect to
exclude such Purchased Other Contract from the Purchased Assets notwithstanding
that it is described as a Purchased Asset in Section 2.1.

                  5.2 Pending or Threatened Litigation. Between the date of this
Agreement and the Closing, Sellers and Purchaser shall inform each other,
promptly upon obtaining knowledge thereof, of any pending or threatened
litigation which reasonably could be anticipated to (i) render inaccurate in any
material respect any representation or warranty made by any Seller or Purchaser
(as the case may be); or (ii) prohibit or restrain or materially and adversely
affect the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or the
performance by any Seller or Purchaser of their respective obligations
hereunder.

                  5.3 Tax Matters/Allocation of Purchase Price.

                  (a) Within 90 days after the completion of the final
determination of the Special Procedures Report of Assets Acquired and
Liabilities Assumed, Purchaser shall provide to Comdisco copies of a schedule
allocating the Purchase Price (and any other items required to be treated as
additional Purchase Price at such time) among the Sellers and the Purchased
Assets (the "Allocation Statement"); provided, that the Allocation Statement
shall not be inconsistent with the allocation of the Purchase Price agreed to by
Purchaser and the Sellers pursuant to Section 2.3, except to the extent any
inconsistencies relate to or arise out of the final determination of the Special
Procedures Report of Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed. Within 60 days
after the receipt of such Allocation Statement, Comdisco shall propose to
Purchaser any changes to such Allocation Statement or shall indicate its
concurrence therewith, which concurrence shall not be unreasonably withheld. The
failure by Comdisco to propose any such change or to indicate its concurrence
within such 60 days shall be deemed to be an indication of its concurrence with
such Allocation Statement. Purchaser and each Seller shall file, and shall cause
their Affiliates to file, all Tax Returns and statements (including Form 8594),
forms and schedules in connection therewith in a manner consistent with such
allocation of the Purchase Price and shall take no position contrary thereto
unless required to do so by applicable Tax laws. Any disputes with respect to
the items on the Allocation Statement which Purchaser and Comdisco, acting in
good faith, are unable to resolve shall be resolved by the Selected Accounting
Firm. Each of the parties to this Agreement shall be bound by the decision
rendered by the Selected Accounting Firm.

                  (b) Cooperation with Respect to Tax Returns. Purchaser and
each Seller agree to furnish or cause to be furnished to each other, each at
their own expense, as promptly as practicable, such information (including
access to books and records) and assistance, including making employees
available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
explanations of any material provided relating to the Purchased Assets as is
reasonably necessary for the filing of any Tax Return, for the preparation for
any audit, and for the prosecution or defense of any claim, suit or proceeding
relating to any adjustment or proposed adjustment with respect to Taxes or any
appraisal of the Purchased Assets. Each Seller shall retain in its possession
all Tax Returns and tax records relating to the Purchased Assets that might be
relevant to any taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing Date (or the
date of the Second Closing with respect to Purchased Financing Contracts
transferred at the Second Closing) until the relevant statute of limitations has
expired. After such time, each Seller may dispose of such materials, provided
that prior to such disposition such Seller shall give Purchaser a reasonable
opportunity to take possession of such materials. Purchaser shall retain in its
possession, and shall provide the Sellers reasonable access to (including the
right to make copies of), such supporting books and records and any other
materials that the Sellers may specify with respect to Tax matters relating to
any taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing Date (or the date of the
Second Closing with respect to Purchased Financing Contracts transferred at the
Second Closing) until 60 days after the relevant statute of limitations has
expired.

                  (c) Transfer Taxes. The Sellers shall be liable for and shall
pay (and the Sellers shall indemnify and hold Purchaser and each Purchaser
Affiliate harmless from and against) any sales, use, transfer, stamp duty,
registration duty, recording or similar Taxes (collectively "Transfer Taxes")
due as a result of the transactions provided herein and agrees to file all
necessary documentation (including, but not limited to, all Tax Returns) with
respect to all such Taxes in a timely manner. Purchaser shall co-operate with
the Sellers and otherwise shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain (at the Sellers' expense) any available refunds of, or credits for, any
Transfer Taxes, and to the extent Purchaser or the applicable Purchaser
Affiliate actually receives any such refunds or credits, net of any Taxes
payable with respect thereto, Purchaser or the applicable Purchaser Affiliate
shall remit to the applicable Seller the amount of such refund (to the extent
such Seller previously paid such Transfer Taxes), promptly following receipt
thereof (provided such Seller has otherwise complied with its obligations
pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 5.3(c)). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Approval Order shall contain a provision that the Sellers' sale,
transfer, assignment and conveyance of the Purchased Assets to Purchaser
hereunder shall be entitled to the protections afforded under Section 1146(c) of
the Bankruptcy Code. Purchaser and the Sellers shall co-operate in providing
each other any applicable resale exemption certificate.

                  5.4 Indemnifications, Assumptions of Liability and Related
Matters.

                  (a) Indemnification by Sellers for Breach. Each Seller shall
indemnify and hold harmless to indemnify and hold harmless (provided, however,
CHG shall indemnify and hold harmless solely to the extent applicable to CHG)
any Purchaser and its Affiliates, and in each such case their respective
directors, officers, employees and agents (collectively, the "Purchaser
Indemnified Parties"), from and against and in respect of any and all Damages
suffered or incurred by any of them resulting from, arising out of, based on or
relating to, without duplication (i) any breach of any representation or
warranty made by any Seller in this Agreement (without duplication as to matters
indemnified pursuant to Section 5.4(d), Section 5.4(e) and Section 5.4(g)); or
(ii) any failure to perform duly and punctually any covenant, agreement or
undertaking on the part of any Seller contained in this Agreement (without
duplication as to matters indemnified pursuant to Section 5.4(d), Section 5.4(e)
and Section 5.4(g)); or (iii) any breach of a representation or warranty
included in any certificate, Schedule or other agreement, instrument or
document, in each case delivered by any Seller, or any of their respective
Affiliates to Purchaser pursuant to the terms of this Agreement (collectively,
the "Seller Related Documents") or (iv) any employees of any Seller or any
benefit plans or payroll practices of any Seller; provided, however, that (A) in
the event Purchaser waives in writing its condition to Closing pursuant to
Section 6.2(a) as such condition relates to a breach of the representation and
warranty contained in Section 3.7(a), Purchaser shall not be entitled after
Closing to seek indemnification from any Seller in respect of such breach of the
representation and warranty contained in Section 3.7(a), (B) Purchaser shall not
be entitled to indemnification pursuant to clause (i) of this Section 5.4(a) as
a result of any breach of any representation or warranty made by any Seller in
Section 3.7(a) hereof to the extent, but solely to the extent, that a matter
causing a breach of Section 3.7(a) is the subject of a specific representation
or warranty in Article III made by such Seller breaching Section 3.7(a), and (C)
in the event that a Seller notifies Purchaser pursuant to Section 5.1(h)(iii)
that a Financing Contract does not satisfy the representations and warranties of
Article III (a "Section 5.1(h)(iii) Notice") and Purchaser does not notify such
Seller that it is excluding such Financing Contract from the Purchased Financing
Contracts pursuant to clause (H)(z) of the proviso of the definition thereof,
Purchaser shall not be entitled to indemnification for such Purchased Financing
Contract pursuant to clause (i) of this Section 5.4(a) with regard to the
circumstances giving rise to the breach of the representation and warranty
identified in the Section 5.1(h)(iii) Notice. For purposes of this Section
5.4(a), a breach of a representation or warranty contained in this Agreement or
a Seller Related Document shall be deemed to exist either if such representation
or warranty is actually inaccurate or breached or if such representation or
warranty would have been breached or would have been inaccurate if such
representation or warranty had not contained any limitation or qualification as
to materiality, Material Adverse Effect or Seller's Knowledge, it being the
intention of the parties hereto that the Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall be
indemnified and held harmless from and against any and all Damages suffered or
incurred by any of them resulting from, arising out of, based upon or relating
to the failure of any such representation or warranty, certificate, Schedule or
other agreement, instrument or document to be true and correct in any respect,
determined in each case without regard to any qualification as to materiality,
Material Adverse Effect or Seller's Knowledge set forth with respect thereto;
provided, however, that for the purposes of Section 5.4(a), the representations
and warranties contained in Sections 3.7(a) and 3.13(ii) hereof shall not be
without regard to any qualification as to materiality, Material Adverse Effect
or Seller's Knowledge set forth with respect thereto and; provided further,
however, that for the purposes of Section 5.4(a), the representation and
warranty contained in Section 3.19(b) hereof shall not be without regard to any
qualification as to Seller's Knowledge set forth with respect thereto.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, neither Seller shall
be liable in respect of any amounts or losses (of the type described in the
definition of Damages) suffered or incurred by a Purchaser Indemnified Party
resulting from, arising out of, based on or relating to breaches of
representations or warranties made by any Seller to the extent that such amounts
or losses are actually reflected in the calculation of the Purchase Price, as
determined pursuant to Section 2.2 hereof (whether through a decrease in the
amount of the Purchased Assets or an increase in the amount of Assumed
Liabilities, in each case as reflected on the Special Procedures Report of
Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed).

                  (b) Limitation on Liability of Sellers.

                  (i) Each Purchaser Indemnified Party entitled to
         indemnification for any Damages suffered or incurred by such Person
         resulting from, arising out of, based on or relating to a failure to
         perform any covenant, agreement or undertaking of any Seller shall be
         entitled to such indemnification for the full amount of such Damages
         regardless of the amount of the Damages.

                  (ii) Each Purchaser Indemnified Party entitled to
         indemnification for any Damages suffered or incurred by such Person
         resulting from, arising out of, based on or relating to (A) a breach of
         any representation or warranty made by any Seller in this Agreement or
         (B) any breach of any representation or warranty in any Seller Related
         Document shall be entitled to indemnification from any Seller for the
         full amount of all such Damages which in the aggregate are in excess of
         an amount that equals to the greater of (1) 1.1 percent of the
         aggregate Purchase Price as of the Closing Date and (2) $1,000,000;
         provided, however, that no Seller will be liable for any such Damages
         to the extent, and only to the extent, of the excess of the aggregate
         amount thereof over an amount that equals to the lesser of (x) 12
         percent of the aggregate Net Book Value of the Purchased Assets as of
         the Closing Date and (y) $20,000,000; provided, further that, without
         limiting the liability of Comdisco for such Damages, CHG will not be
         liable for any such Damages to the extent, and only to the extent, that
         the aggregate amount thereof exceeds the portion of the Purchase Price
         allocated to CHG pursuant to Section 2.3.

                  (iii) (A) Subject at all times to the limitations of Section
         5.4(b)(ii) and Section 5.4(c), any Seller may satisfy its obligations
         pursuant to Section 5.4(a) with respect to any claim by Purchaser or
         any Purchaser Affiliate for Damages by the payment to Purchaser or
         Purchaser Affiliate, as applicable, of the Repurchase Amount and the
         assumption of all rights and obligations of such Purchaser or Purchaser
         Affiliate under the applicable Purchased Financing Contract or with
         respect to other applicable Purchased Asset, as the case may be, as set
         forth in clause (B) below; provided, however, any obligation of any
         Seller pursuant to Section 5.4(a) with respect to any Purchased
         Financing Contract or other Purchased Asset with respect to which the
         Obligor or any other third party has asserted a written claim for
         Damages against any Purchaser Indemnified Party shall survive such
         repurchase and assumption. Notwithstanding anything contrary in this
         Agreement, (1) any obligation of Purchaser pursuant to Sections 5.4(h)
         and 5.4(k), with respect to the repurchased Purchased Financing
         Contract or other Purchased Asset, which obligation arises after the
         applicable Closing Date and prior to the repurchase, shall survive such
         repurchase and assumption and (2) Purchaser shall not have any further
         obligation under Sections 5.4(h) or 5.4(k) in respect of any
         repurchased Purchased Financing Contract or other Purchased Asset for
         Damages to the extent such Damages result from, arise out of, are based
         on or relate to, actions taken or failed to be taken after the date of
         such repurchase. Nothing set forth in this clause (A) shall be deemed a
         reaffirmation or revival of any claim for Damages of any Obligor or any
         other third party which has been barred or discharged against any
         Seller pursuant to the implementation of any provisions of the
         Bankruptcy Code and the applicable Seller and the Purchaser or
         Purchaser Affiliate shall be entitled to assert, to the fullest extent
         possible, such bar or discharge in connection with any claim asserted
         by such Obligor or third party.


                           (B) Upon receipt of the Repurchase Amount by
                  Purchaser or Purchaser Affiliate, as applicable, Purchaser or
                  Purchaser Affiliate shall transfer and assign to the
                  applicable Seller all of such Purchaser's or Purchaser
                  Affiliate's rights and obligations with respect to such
                  Purchased Financing Contract or such other Purchased Asset
                  after the consummation of such transfer and assumption and
                  such Seller shall assume all obligations of such Purchaser or
                  Purchaser Affiliate arising after the consummation of such
                  transfer and assumption except for obligations arising out of
                  a breach by any Purchaser or Purchaser Affiliate prior to the
                  consummation of such transfer and assumption. Purchaser shall
                  and shall cause Purchaser Affiliate, as applicable, to remit
                  all proceeds received by Purchaser or applicable Purchaser
                  Affiliate to the applicable Seller with respect to such
                  Purchased Financing Contract or such other Purchased Asset
                  after such transfer. Sellers agree that Sellers shall
                  indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser Indemnified Parties with
                  respect to any Transfer Taxes arising out of or caused by such
                  transfer.

                  (c) Survival of Representations and Warranties of Sellers.

                  (i) The Special Representations and indemnifications with
         respect to their breach shall survive until three months after the
         expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (including
         extensions) applicable to Purchaser and/or the Purchaser Indemnified
         Parties potentially incurring Damages arising from, or relating to, any
         circumstances giving rise to any breach thereof.

                  (ii) The representations and warranties of each Seller in (A)
         this Agreement which are not Special Representations and (B) the Seller
         Related Documents shall survive the Closing until the expiration of 12
         months after the Closing.

                  (d) [Intentionally Omitted.]

                  (e) Tax Indemnification. Each Seller shall indemnify and hold
harmless, (provided, however, CHG shall indemnify and hold harmless solely to
the extent applicable to CHG) all Purchaser Indemnified Parties from and against
any and all Damages suffered or incurred by any of them resulting from, arising
out of, based on or relating to:

                           (A) any and all sales, use or other similar Taxes
                  required to be collected in respect of any Purchased Financing
                  Contract during the 12 months following the Closing Date if
                  (i) such Tax is not being collected by Purchaser or the
                  applicable Purchaser Affiliate in respect of the Purchased
                  Financing Contract pursuant to (x) Purchaser's or the
                  applicable Purchaser Affiliate's reliance on an applicable
                  exemption from such Tax and (y) any Seller's reliance on such
                  exemption for periods on or prior to the Closing Date, and
                  (ii) such exemption from Tax is dependent upon receipt of a
                  properly executed Exemption Certificate; provided, that in no
                  event shall any Seller be required to indemnify Purchaser
                  under this Section 5.4(e)(A) to the extent such Damage arises
                  out of a change in law after the Closing Date affecting
                  Purchaser's obligation to collect such Tax;

                           (B) any liability for sales, use or other similar
                  Taxes assessed in respect of any Purchased Financing Contract
                  after the Closing where such Taxes were erroneously paid at
                  the inception of such Purchased Financing Contract;

                           (C) any claim by any Person in respect of sales, use
                  or other similar Tax paid on or prior to the Closing Date (or
                  the date of the Second Closing with respect to Purchased
                  Financing Contracts transferred at the Second Closing);

                           (D) any Taxes for which any Seller is liable pursuant
                  to Section 2.5 or Section 5.3(c) hereof; and

                           (E) any Taxes asserted against Purchaser or any of
                  its Affiliates by operation of law, statute, common law or
                  otherwise or under successor liability or similar theories
                  that would impose liability on Purchaser as a result of its
                  purchase of the Purchased Assets pursuant hereto.

                  (f) [Intentionally Omitted.]

                  (g) Additional Indemnification by Sellers. Each Seller shall
indemnify and hold harmless, (provided, however, CHG shall indemnify and hold
harmless solely to the extent applicable to CHG), all Purchaser Indemnified
Parties from and against any and all Damages suffered or incurred by any of them
resulting from, arising out of, based on or relating to:

                  (i) any of the Excluded Assets or the ownership, operation,
         servicing, lease or use thereof, or any action taken with respect
         thereto, by any Seller or any other Person;

                  (ii) the Excluded Liabilities (including, without limitation,
         any such liabilities arising by operation of law, statute, common law
         or otherwise or under successor liability or similar theories that
         would impose liability on Purchaser as a result of its purchase of the
         Purchased Assets pursuant hereto); or

                  (iii) the failure to comply with any "bulk sales" or similar
         laws promulgated by any Governmental Entity.

                  (h) Indemnification by Purchaser for Breach. Purchaser shall
indemnify and hold harmless the Sellers and Sellers' Affiliates and their
respective directors, officers, employees and agents (collectively, "Seller
Indemnified Parties") from and against any and all Damages suffered or incurred
by any of them resulting from, arising out of, based on or relating to (i) any
breach of any representation or warranty made by Purchaser in this Agreement; or
(ii) any failure to perform duly and punctually any covenant, agreement or
undertaking on the part of Purchaser contained in this Agreement; or (iii) any
breach of a representation or warranty included in any certificate, Schedule or
other agreement, instrument or document, in each case delivered or to be
delivered by Purchaser or any Purchaser Affiliate to the Sellers pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement (collectively, the "Purchaser Related Documents"). For
purposes of this Section 5.4(h), a breach of a representation or warranty
contained in this Agreement or a Purchaser Related Document shall be deemed to
exist either if such representation or warranty is actually inaccurate or
breached or if such representation or warranty would have been breached or been
inaccurate if such representation or warranty had not contained any limitation
or qualification as to materiality, material adverse effect or knowledge, it
being the intention of the parties hereto that the Seller Indemnified Parties
shall be indemnified and held harmless from and against any and all Damages
suffered or incurred by any of them resulting from, arising out of, based on or
relating to the failure of any such representation, warranty, certificate,
Schedule or other agreement, instrument or document to be true and correct in
any respect, determined in each case without regard to any qualification as to
materiality, material adverse effect or knowledge set forth with respect
thereto.

                  (i) [Intentionally Omitted.]

                  (j) Survival of Representations and Warranties of Purchaser.
The representations and warranties of Purchaser in this Agreement and the
Purchaser Related Documents shall survive the Closing until the expiration of 24
months after the Closing.

                  (k) Additional Indemnification by Purchaser. Purchaser shall
indemnify and hold harmless all Seller Indemnified Parties from and against any
and all Damages suffered or incurred by any of them resulting from, arising out
of, based on or relating to:

                  (i) the Purchased Assets or the ownership, operation,
servicing, lease or use thereof, or any action taken with respect thereto after
the Closing, by Purchaser or any Purchaser Affiliate or any other Person, other
than with respect to any matter, circumstance Damage or event which is the
subject of, or gives rise to, an indemnification, payment or similar obligation
of any Seller pursuant to this Agreement; or

                  (ii) the Assumed Liabilities.

                  (l) Indemnification Procedure. For the purposes of
administering the indemnification provisions of this Section 5.4, the following
procedures shall apply from and after the Closing Date:

                  (i) An indemnified party shall notify the Indemnitor of any
         Indemnification Event arising from an action or proceeding by a third
         party against such Indemnitor in writing within 15 days following the
         receipt by any officer or director of the indemnified party of notice
         of the commencement of such action or proceeding or within 30 days of
         the assertion of any claim against such indemnified party giving rise
         to indemnity pursuant to this Section 5.4 (any 15 or 30 day
         notification requirement shall begin to run, in the case of a claim
         which is amended so as to give rise to an amended Indemnification
         Event, from the first day such claim is amended to include any claim
         which is an Indemnification Event hereunder). Such notice shall
         describe in reasonable detail the basis of such Indemnification Event.
         Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the failure to give notice in
         a timely fashion shall not result in a waiver of any right to
         indemnification hereunder except to the extent that the Indemnitor's
         ability to defend against the event with respect to which
         indemnification is sought is adversely affected by the failure of the
         indemnified party to give notice in a timely fashion.

                  (ii) The Indemnitor shall be entitled (but not obligated) to
         assume the defense or settlement of any such action or proceeding, or
         to participate in any negotiations or proceedings to settle or
         otherwise eliminate any claim, if it shall provide the indemnified
         parties a written acknowledgement of its liability for the indemnity
         against Damages relating to such claim; provided, however, that,
         subject to clause (iv) hereof, Purchaser shall have the sole right,
         with counsel of its choice, to defend, settle or otherwise dispose of,
         in its sole discretion, any action, claim or proceeding that
         constitutes a Non-Assumable Claim, and the Sellers shall not be
         entitled to assume the defense thereof, except that the Sellers shall
         be entitled (but not obligated) to assume the defense, settlement or
         other disposition of any Non-Assumable Claim of the type described in
         clause (i) of the definition thereof that relates to Tax items of any
         Seller and does not involve Tax items of Purchaser or any Purchaser
         Affiliate. If the Indemnitor assumes any such defense or settlement or
         any such negotiations, it shall pursue such defense, settlement or
         negotiations in good faith. If the Indemnitor fails to elect in writing
         within 30 days of the notification referred to above to assume the
         defense, the indemnified party may engage counsel to defend, settle or
         otherwise dispose of such action or proceeding, which counsel shall be
         reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitor; provided, however, that the
         indemnified party shall not settle or compromise any such action,
         proceeding or claim without the prior written consent or agreement of
         the Indemnitor (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
         delayed).

                  In the event the indemnified party elects to defend, settle or
         otherwise dispose of a Non-Assumable Claim, it shall pursue such
         defense, settlement or other disposition in good faith. Promptly upon
         the reasonable request of the Indemnitor the indemnified party shall
         provide the Indemnitor with information summarizing any material
         developments in any Non-Assumable Claim that is being defended by the
         indemnified party and shall make available a designated representative
         to consult with or otherwise discuss any such Non-Assumable Claim with
         the Indemnitor (at mutually convenient times). Nothing herein shall be
         deemed to require the indemnified party (A) to make any disclosure
         that, in its judgment, could prejudice its position or waive any
         privilege or (B) to take or refrain from taking any action; it being
         understood that, subject to clause (iv) hereof, the defense, settlement
         or other disposition of any Non-Assumable Claim shall be conducted in
         the indemnified party's sole discretion. An Indemnitor's liability for
         any costs and attorneys' fees and disbursements incurred by an
         indemnified party in respect of a Non-Assumable Claim shall be limited
         to the amount of such costs and attorneys' fees and disbursements
         incurred up to and including (i) entry of one or more judgments that,
         in the aggregate, resolve all issues, claims, counter-claims, actions
         or proceedings resulting from, arising out of, based on or relating to,
         such Non-Assumable Claim and (ii) if an indemnified party elects to
         appeal any portion of such judgment(s), the entry of one or more
         judgments, rulings, opinions or other orders (that, in the aggregate,
         resolve all issues, claims, counter-claims, actions or proceedings that
         are appealed) by the judicial forum that conducts the first level of
         appellate review of such issues, claims, counter-claims, actions or
         proceedings.

                  (iii) In cases where the Indemnitor has assumed the defense or
         settlement with respect to an Indemnification Event, the Indemnitor
         shall be entitled to assume the defense or settlement thereof with
         counsel of its own choosing; provided, however, that: (A) the
         indemnified party (and its counsel) shall be entitled to continue to
         participate at its own cost (except as provided below) in any such
         action or proceeding or in any negotiations or proceedings to settle or
         otherwise eliminate any claim for which indemnification is being
         sought; (B) the Indemnitor shall not be entitled to settle or
         compromise any such action, proceeding or claim without the consent or
         agreement of the indemnified party (which consent will not be
         unreasonably withheld or delayed); provided, further, that if and only
         if such consent is withheld and the settlement or compromise involves
         only the payment of monetary damages (as to which the Indemnitor has
         established to the indemnified party, in the indemnified party's
         reasonable discretion, that such Indemnitor is capable of funding) and
         provides an unconditional release of the indemnified person, the
         Indemnitor's liability shall be limited to the amount for which the
         Indemnitor agreed with the claimant to settle and the Indemnitor shall
         remain responsible for its costs and attorneys' fees to the date such
         settlement was rejected by the indemnified party and the indemnified
         party shall be responsible for the attorneys' fees and disbursements in
         respect of such claim thereafter; and (C) after written notice by the
         Indemnitor to the indemnified party (as provided above) of its election
         to assume control of the defense of any claim, the Indemnitor shall not
         be liable to such indemnified party hereunder for any attorneys' fees
         and disbursements subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in
         connection therewith (except as provided below).

                  (iv) In the event indemnification is requested, the relevant
         Indemnitor, its representatives and agents shall have access to the
         premises, books and records of the indemnified party or parties seeking
         such indemnification and their Affiliates to the extent reasonably
         necessary (A) for the Indemnitor to determine if the indemnification
         claim relates to an Indemnification Event and (B) to assist it in
         defending or settling any action, proceeding or claim; provided,
         however, that such access shall be conducted in such manner as not to
         interfere unreasonably with the operation of the business of the
         indemnified party or parties. Except as reasonably necessary (A) for
         the Indemnitor to determine if the indemnification claim relates to an
         Indemnification Event and (B) to assist it in defending or settling
         such action, proceeding or claim, the indemnified party shall not be
         required to disclose any information with respect to itself or any of
         its Affiliates (or former Affiliates), and the indemnified party shall
         not be required to participate in the defense of any claim to be
         indemnified hereunder (except as otherwise expressly set forth herein),
         unless otherwise required or reasonably necessary in the defense of any
         claim to be indemnified hereunder.

                  (v) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section
         5.4, the Indemnitor shall continue to pay the reasonable attorneys'
         fees and disbursements and other costs of separate legal counsel for
         the indemnified parties (as a group) (A) relating to their
         participation in the defense of any Indemnification Event (whether or
         not the Indemnitor shall have assumed the defense of such
         Indemnification Event) to the extent such participation relates to a
         claim or defense that the Indemnitor does not have, may not assert on
         behalf of the indemnified party or that the indemnified party shall
         have reasonably concluded (based on advice of outside counsel) relates
         to a claim or defense as to which the Indemnitor may have a conflict of
         interest, or (B) relating to discovery against or testimony of such
         indemnified party and for participation of such indemnified party's own
         counsel in such discovery and testimony.

                  (vi) Any claim for indemnification hereunder that does not
         arise out of a third-party claim shall be asserted by the Purchaser
         Indemnified Party by delivering notice thereof to the Indemnitor. If
         the Indemnitor does not respond to such notice within 45 days after
         receipt of notice, it shall have no further right to contest the
         validity of such claim.

                  (vii) With respect to any Non-Assumable Claim, upon the
         receipt by the indemnified party of an offer of compromise relating to
         such Non-Assumable Claim that includes an unconditional release of the
         indemnified party or upon entry of a final judgment with respect to
         such Non-Assumable Claim (and such offer to compromise or judgment
         requires only the payment of money), the Indemnitor shall have the
         right to terminate its liability for subsequent legal fees and
         disbursements in respect of such Non-Assumable Claim upon its
         irrevocable offer to the indemnified party to pay (and establishment of
         ability to pay as described in clause (iii) above) the amount contained
         in such offer to compromise or judgment; upon receipt, in the form of
         immediately available funds by the indemnified party of the amount
         contained in such offer to compromise or judgment and payment of all
         other Damages suffered or incurred by the indemnified party in respect
         of such Non-Assumable Claim, the Indemnitor shall have no further
         liability to the indemnified party in respect of such Non-Assumable
         Claim.

                  (m) Any payments under Section 5.3 or 5.4 of this Agreement
shall be treated by the parties hereto for federal, state and local income tax
purposes (whether foreign or domestic) as a non-taxable reimbursement or
purchase price adjustment, except to the extent that a contrary treatment is
required by law.

                  (n) [Intentionally Omitted.]

                  (o) Purchaser may satisfy any claims for the payment of
liabilities on behalf of any Seller for which Purchaser is entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this Section 5.4 without being required to pursue a
right of subrogation against such Seller in lieu of claiming indemnification
therefor.

                  (p) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the amount of Damages which an Indemnitor is required to pay to, for
or on behalf of any indemnified party pursuant to this Section 5.4 shall be
adjusted (including, without limitation, retroactively) (i) by any insurance
proceeds actually recovered by such indemnified party in reduction of the
related indemnifiable loss (the "Indemnifiable Loss"), (ii) to take account of
any net actual reduction of Tax liability that is actually realized by such
indemnified party as a result of any Indemnifiable Loss (a "Tax Benefit") and
(iii) to take into account any actual increase in Tax liability that is imposed
on the indemnified party as a result of the receipt of the Indemnity Payment (as
defined below) pursuant to this Section 5.4 (a "Tax Liability"); provided that
although an indemnified party shall be under no obligation to seek or pursue any
such insurance recovery or Tax Benefit an Indemnitor shall be entitled to reduce
payments otherwise required pursuant to this Section 5.4 (or, as the case may
be, if such payments have been made, promptly receive reimbursement therefor) in
respect of Indemnifiable Loss to the extent insurance proceeds actually are
recovered, or a Tax Benefit is actually realized, by such indemnified party in
reduction of such Indemnifiable Loss (but only to the extent that such insurance
recovery or Tax Benefit was not already taken into account in determining the
amount of such Indemnifiable Loss); and provided, further, that the
determination as to whether an indemnified party has actually realized a Tax
Benefit or a Tax Liability, and the amount thereof, shall be determined by such
indemnified party in its sole discretion and the Indemnitor shall not have the
right to review or comment thereon. Amounts required to be paid, as reduced or
increased pursuant to this Section 5.4(p), are hereafter sometimes called an
"Indemnity Payment." If an indemnified party shall have received or shall have
had paid on its behalf an Indemnity Payment in respect of an Indemnifiable Loss
and shall subsequently receive insurance proceeds in respect of such
Indemnifiable Loss, or actually realize any Tax Benefit as a result of such
Indemnifiable Loss as determined by such indemnified party as provided above, or
actually realize any Tax Liability in respect of such Indemnity Payment, then
the indemnified party shall pay to the Indemnitor the amount of such insurance
proceeds or Tax Benefit or, if lesser, the amount of the Indemnity Payment or
the Indemnitor shall pay to the indemnified party the amount of such Tax
Liability, as the case may be. To the extent that Purchaser or any Purchaser
Affiliate may obtain recovery from any insurance policy of an Obligor for any
Damages incurred by Purchaser or any Purchaser Affiliate giving rise to an
indemnity claim hereunder, Purchaser shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to, or to cause such Purchaser Affiliate to use its commercially
reasonable efforts to, seek such recovery from such insurance policy.

                  (q) Any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or
relating to this Section 5.4 (a "Dispute") shall be resolved in accordance with
the procedure set forth herein.

                  (i) All communications between the parties or their
         representatives in connection with the attempted resolution of any
         Dispute shall be deemed to have been delivered in furtherance of a
         Dispute settlement and shall be exempt from discovery and production,
         and shall not be admissible in evidence (whether as an admission or
         otherwise), in any arbitral or other proceeding for the resolution of
         the Dispute.

                  (ii) After completion of any prior procedures required hereby,
         either party may submit the Dispute for resolution by arbitration
         pursuant to the Rules of the Center for Public Resources ("CPR") for
         Non-Administered Arbitration of Business Disputes as in effect at the
         time of the arbitration. The parties consent to a single, consolidated
         arbitration for all Disputes existing at the time such Dispute arises
         initially for which arbitration is permitted.

                  (iii) The neutral organization for purposes of the CPR rules
         will be the CPR. The arbitral tribunal shall be composed of one
         arbitrator selected by agreement of the parties or, in the absence of
         such agreement within 60 days after either party first proposes an
         arbitrator, by the CPR. Any arbitration hereunder shall be conducted in
         Chicago, Illinois. Each party shall be permitted to present its case,
         witnesses and evidence, if any, in the presence of the other party. A
         written transcript of the proceedings shall be made and furnished to
         the parties. The arbitrator shall determine the Dispute in accordance
         with the law of Illinois, without giving effect to any conflict of law
         rules or other rules that might render such law inapplicable or
         unavailable, and shall apply this Agreement according to its terms.

                  (iv) The parties agree to be bound by any award or order
         resulting from any arbitration conducted hereunder and further agree
         that:

                           (A) any monetary award shall include preaward
                  interest, to the extent appropriate, and shall be made and
                  payable in U.S. dollars through a bank selected by the
                  recipient of such award, free of any withholding tax or other
                  deduction, together with interest thereon at the
                  Indemnification Rate (as of the date of such award) from the
                  date the award is granted to the date it is paid in full;

                           (B) in the context of an attempt by either party to
                  enforce an arbitral award or order, any defenses relating to
                  the parties' capacity or the validity of this Agreement or any
                  related agreement under any law are hereby waived; and

                           (C) judgment on any award or order resulting from an
                  arbitration conducted under this Section may be entered and
                  enforced in any court, in any country, having jurisdiction
                  thereof or having jurisdiction over any of the parties or any
                  of their assets.

                  (v) Except as expressly permitted by this Agreement, no party
         will commence or voluntarily participate in any court action or
         proceeding concerning a Dispute, except for enforcement as contemplated
         by Section 5.4(q)(iv)(C) above. For purposes of enforcement of any
         undisputed obligation, the parties hereto submit to the non-exclusive
         jurisdiction of the courts of the Northern District of Illinois.

                  (vi) In addition to the authority otherwise conferred on the
         arbitral tribunal, the tribunal shall have the authority to make such
         orders for interim relief, including injunctive relief, as it may deem
         just and equitable.

                  (r) The indemnification obligations of the Sellers pursuant to
this Section 5.4 shall survive the confirmation of a plan in, or dismissal or
conversion to a case under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code of, the Chapter 11
Cases.

                  (s) Exclusive Remedy. The indemnification provided for in this
Section 5.4 shall be the exclusive remedy for asserting claims for monetary
Damages as a result of (i) the breach of any representation or warranty made by
any Seller or Purchaser in this Agreement, the Seller Related Documents or the
Purchaser Related Documents or (ii) the failure to perform any covenant,
agreement or undertaking on the part of all such parties contained in this
Agreement, the Seller Related Documents and the Purchaser Related Documents, in
each case other than as a result of fraud or intentional misconduct.

                  5.5 Preparation of Closing Date Schedule of Assets Acquired
and Liabilities Assumed; Adjusted Closing Date Schedule of Assets Acquired and
Liabilities Assumed; Special Procedures Report of Assets Acquired and
Liabilities Assumed; and Purchase Price Certificate.

                  (a) Preparation of Schedules of Assets Acquired and
Liabilities Assumed.

                  (i) As soon as practicable following each Closing, the Sellers
         shall prepare a draft of the Closing Date Schedule of Assets Acquired
         and Liabilities Assumed and a draft of the Adjusted Closing Date
         Schedule of Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed with respect to the
         Purchased Assets acquired at such Closing. The draft Closing Date
         Schedule of Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed shall be prepared
         in accordance with the Accounting Principles and the draft Adjusted
         Closing Date Schedule of Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed shall
         reflect the Special Adjustments. At a minimum, the Adjusted Closing
         Date Schedule of Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed shall
         differentiate the assets among those described in Sections 2.2(a)(i),
         2.2(a)(ii) and 2.2(b) for purposes of calculating the Purchase Price.
         The Sellers shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause
         the draft Closing Date Schedule of Assets Acquired and Liabilities
         Assumed and the draft Adjusted Closing Date Schedule of Assets Acquired
         and Liabilities Assumed to be completed within 30 days following the
         applicable Closing Date and, upon completion, such draft schedules
         shall promptly be provided to Seller's Accountants.

                  (ii) Within 30 days following the delivery of the draft
         Closing Date Schedule of Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed and
         the draft Adjusted Closing Date Schedule of Assets Acquired and
         Liabilities Assumed to Seller's Accountants as set forth in clause (i)
         above, the Sellers will cause Seller's Accountants to inform
         Purchaser's Accountants of the scope and nature of the special
         procedures that will be performed by Seller's Accountants on the
         Closing Date Schedule of Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed and
         the Adjusted Closing Date Schedule of Assets Acquired and Liabilities
         Assumed.

                  (iii) Immediately following the delivery of the draft Closing
         Date Schedule of Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed and the draft
         Adjusted Closing Date Schedule of Assets Acquired and Liabilities
         Assumed to Seller's Accountants, as set forth in clause (i) above,
         Sellers shall cause Seller's Accountants to perform the special
         procedures to review the draft Closing Date Schedule of Assets Acquired
         and Liabilities Assumed and the draft Adjusted Closing Date Schedule of
         Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed, and such special procedures
         shall be sufficient to permit Seller's Accountants to state that the
         Closing Date Schedule of Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed fairly
         presents the Purchased Assets and Assumed Liabilities, as of the
         Closing Date in accordance with the Accounting Principles, and that the
         Adjusted Closing Date Schedule of Assets Acquired and Liabilities
         Assumed accurately reflects the Special Adjustments.

                  (iv) The Sellers shall use their commercially reasonable
         efforts to cause Seller's Accountants to deliver the Special Procedures
         Report of Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed, together with its
         report of the special procedures utilized to develop the Special
         Procedure Report of Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed, to each of
         the Sellers, Purchaser and Purchaser's Accountants within 60 days
         following the date of delivery of the draft Closing Date Schedule of
         Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed and the draft Adjusted Closing
         Date Schedule of Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed to the
         Seller's Accountants as set forth in clause (i) above. Concurrent with
         the delivery to the Sellers, Purchaser and Purchaser's Accountants of
         the Special Procedures Report of Assets Acquired and Liabilities
         Assumed, the Sellers shall cause Seller's Accountants to deliver to the
         Sellers, Purchaser and Purchaser's Accountants a certificate (the
         "Purchase Price Certificate") showing in reasonable detail the
         calculations used to derive the Purchase Price. During the 30 days
         following their receipt of the Special Procedures Report of Assets
         Acquired and Liabilities Assumed and Purchase Price Certificate, the
         Sellers, Seller's Accountants, Purchaser and Purchaser's Accountants
         shall have the opportunity to review the Special Procedures Report of
         Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed and Purchase Price Certificate
         (together with Seller's Accountants' working papers) and, during such
         30-day period, the Sellers, Seller's Accountants, Purchaser and
         Purchaser's Accountants shall have the right to propose those changes
         to the Special Procedures Report of Assets Acquired and Liabilities
         Assumed and Purchase Price Certificate, the Sellers, Seller's
         Accountants, Purchaser or Purchaser's Accountants determine to be
         appropriate in order to cause the Special Procedures Report of Assets
         Acquired and Liabilities Assumed to conform to clause (iii) above and
         the Purchase Price Certificate to reflect the calculation of the
         Purchase Price in accordance with to Section 2.2. Items, procedures and
         calculations associated with the Special Procedure Report of Assets
         Acquired and Liabilities Assumed and the Purchase Price Certificate as
         to which no change is proposed in the 30-day period will be deemed to
         have been accepted and become final.

                  (v) Following the delivery of the Special Procedures Report of
         Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed referred to in clause (iv)
         above, Purchaser's Accountants shall be entitled to perform all
         procedures and take any other steps that Purchaser's Accountants, in
         the exercise of their professional judgment, deem appropriate to
         confirm that the Special Procedures Report of Assets Acquired and
         Liabilities Assumed has been prepared in accordance with clause (iii)
         above and the Purchase Price Certificate reflects the calculation of
         the Purchase Price in accordance with Section 2.2.

                  (vi) In the event of any dispute between Purchaser and
         Purchaser's Accountants, on the one hand, and the Sellers and Seller's
         Accountants, on the other hand, regarding any of the adjustments
         proposed by Purchaser or Purchaser's Accountants, on the one hand, or
         the Sellers or Seller's Accountants, on the other hand, with respect to
         the Special Procedures Report of Assets Acquired and Liabilities
         Assumed or the Purchase Price Certificate, which Purchaser and
         Purchaser's Accountants, on the one hand, and the Sellers and Seller's
         Accountants, on the other hand, cannot resolve within 15 days after
         expiration of the 30-day period referred to in clause (iv) above, each
         of the Sellers or Purchaser shall have the right, upon delivery of
         written notice to the other party, to require that such dispute be
         resolved in accordance with the provisions set forth in Section 5.5(b).
         Promptly following the resolution of all disputes with respect to any
         proposed adjustments to the Special Procedures Report of Assets
         Acquired and Liabilities Assumed and Liabilities Assumed or the
         Purchase Price Certificate, the Sellers shall cause Seller's
         Accountants to prepare and deliver to the Sellers, Purchaser and
         Purchaser's Accountants the final Special Procedures Report of Assets
         Acquired and Liabilities Assumed and the final Purchase Price
         Certificate, each of which shall reflect all adjustments thereto which
         have been agreed upon by Purchaser and Purchaser's Accountants, on the
         one hand, and the Sellers and Seller's Accountants, on the other hand,
         and which have been resolved pursuant to Section 5.5(b).

                  (vii) Each of the Sellers, Purchaser, Seller's Accountants and
         Purchaser's Accountants shall have full access to all relevant
         accounting, financial and other records reasonably requested by it in
         connection with the preparation, confirmation or review of the Special
         Procedures Report of Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed and the
         Purchase Price Certificate as well as Seller's Accountants' working
         papers with respect thereto, and each party shall make available to the
         other party and its accountants such personnel as they may reasonably
         request in connection with the preparation or confirmation of the
         Special Procedures Report of Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed
         and the Purchase Price Certificate or the review of Seller's
         Accountants' report of the special procedures utilized to develop the
         Special Procedure Report of Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed.

                  (b) Conflict Resolution Mechanism. Any dispute involving any
of the adjustments to the Special Procedures Report of Assets Acquired and
Liabilities Assumed and the Purchase Price Certificate proposed by the Sellers,
Seller's Accountants, Purchaser or Purchaser's Accountants including, without
limitation, any interpretation or application of any provision of this Agreement
affecting the preparation of the Special Procedures Report of Assets Acquired
and Liabilities Assumed, and the Purchase Price Certificate, not resolved by the
Sellers, Seller's Accountants, Purchaser and Purchaser's Accountants within 15
days after the expiration of the 30-day period referred to in clause (iv) above,
upon the election of any Seller or Purchaser, shall be resolved by the Selected
Accounting Firm. The Selected Accounting Firm shall resolve only issues upon
which Purchaser, Purchaser's Accountants, the Sellers and Seller's Accountants
have been unable to agree. The decision of such Selected Accounting Firm shall
be rendered within 45 days after appointment of the Selected Accounting Firm.
The decision of the Selected Accounting Firm shall be final and binding upon the
parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the aggregate of all amounts in
dispute with respect to all disputes referred to in this Section 5.5(b) shall be
less than $250,000, such disputes shall not be resolved by the Selected
Accounting Firm but shall instead be resolved as follows: 50% of the aggregate
of all amounts in dispute shall be deemed to have been resolved in Sellers'
favor and 50% of the aggregate of all amounts in dispute shall be deemed to have
been resolved in Purchaser's favor.

                  (c) Payment of Fees. The Sellers shall pay all of the fees of
Seller's Accountants and all expenses incurred by such firm, and Purchaser shall
pay all of the fees of Purchaser's Accountants and all expenses incurred by such
firm, and each of the Sellers and Purchaser shall pay one half of the fees of
the Selected Accounting Firm and all expenses incurred by such firm, each in
connection with the tasks outlined in this Section 5.5.

                  (d) Cooperation. The Sellers and Purchaser shall use their
respective commercially reasonable efforts to cause Purchaser's Accountants and
Seller's Accountants to cooperate with each other in connection with all of
their activities undertaken in connection with this Section 5.5. After delivery
to Purchaser and the Purchaser's Accountants of the Special Procedures Report of
Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed, the Sellers shall instruct Seller's
Accountants to make available to Purchaser's Accountants their work papers from
the special procedures performed on the Closing Date Schedule of Assets Acquired
and Liabilities Assumed and Adjusted Closing Date Schedule of Assets Acquired
and Liabilities Assumed.

                  5.6 Insurance; Risk of Loss. To the extent that any insurance
policies owned or controlled by any Seller (collectively, the "Seller's
Insurance Policies") (i) cover any Damages as to which the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties are entitled to indemnification under Section 5.4 (subject to the
limitations on indemnification contained in Section 5.4, including Section
5.4(s)) and (ii) permit claims to be made thereunder with respect to such
Damages ("Seller Claims"), each Seller shall cooperate, and shall cause its
Affiliates to cooperate, with Purchaser in submitting Seller Claims (or pursuing
Seller Claims previously made) on behalf of Purchaser under the Seller's
Insurance Policies (subject to the limitations on indemnification contained in
Section 5.4, including Section 5.4(s)). Purchaser shall bear the out-of-pocket
expenses of the Sellers and their respective Affiliates in the preparing,
submitting or pursuing such Seller Claims.

                  5.7 Further Assurances.

                  (a) All amounts which are received by any Seller in respect of
the Purchased Assets (including, without limitation, account receivable and
other payments) which are properly allocable to period after the Closing Date
shall be received by each Seller as agent, in trust for and on behalf of
Purchaser and Purchaser Affiliates, as applicable, and, following the Closing
applicable to the Purchased Assets to which such amounts relate, the Sellers
shall promptly pay or cause to be paid promptly all of such amounts over to
Purchaser and shall provide to Purchaser information as to the nature, source
and classification of such payments, including any invoice relating thereto. All
amounts included in the Excluded Assets (or which are paid in respect of
Excluded Assets) received by Purchaser or any Purchaser Affiliate following the
Closing shall be received by Purchaser or such Purchaser Affiliate as agent, in
trust for and on behalf of the applicable Seller, and Purchaser shall promptly
pay or cause to be promptly paid all of such amounts over to such Seller and
shall provide to such Seller information as to the nature, source and
classification of such payments, including any invoice relating thereto.

                  (b) In addition to the foregoing, after the Closing, each
Seller will, whenever and as often as reasonably requested to do so by
Purchaser, do, execute, acknowledge and deliver any and all such other and
further acts, assignments, transfers and any instruments of further assurance,
approvals and consents as are necessary or proper in order to complete, ensure
and perfect the sale, transfer and conveyance to Purchaser contemplated hereby
of the Purchased Assets and the consummation of the other transactions
contemplated hereby.

                  (c) Purchaser will, after the Closing, whenever and as often
as reasonably requested to do so by any Seller, do, execute, acknowledge and
deliver any and all such other and further acts, assignments, transfers and any
instruments of further assurance, approvals and consents as are necessary or
proper in order to complete, ensure and perfect the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

                  5.8 Payment of Broker's or Finder's Fees. The Sellers shall
pay any and all brokers' or finders' fees, and any other commissions or similar
fees, payable to any Person acting on behalf of the Sellers or any of its
Affiliates or under the authority of any of them, in connection with any of the
transactions contemplated herein, and Purchaser shall pay any and all brokers'
or finders' fees, and any other commissions or similar fees, payable to any
Person acting on behalf of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates or under the
authority of any of them, in connection with any of the transactions
contemplated herein, in each case regardless of whether any claim for payment is
asserted before or after the Closing or before or after any termination of this
Agreement.

                  5.9 Supplements to Schedules; Post-Signing Information. Not
earlier than ten nor later than five Business Days prior to the Closing, the
Sellers and Purchaser will supplement or amend the schedules relating to such
party's respective representations and warranties in this Agreement with respect
to any matter, condition or occurrence hereafter arising which, if existing or
occurring at the date of this Agreement, would have been required to be set
forth or described in such schedules or would otherwise have been inconsistent
with such party's representations herein. Each Seller shall deliver to Purchaser
copies of any Environmental Reports prepared between the date of this Agreement
and the Closing Date promptly following receipt thereof. No supplement or
amendment to the schedules hereto by either party, and no information contained
in any Environmental Report delivered pursuant hereto, shall be deemed to cure
(or affect the rights of any party with respect to) any breach of any
representation or warranty made in this Agreement or have any effect for the
purpose of determining satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Sections 6.2
and 6.3.

                  5.10 [Intentionally Omitted.]

                  5.11 [Intentionally Omitted.]

                  5.12 Certain Bankruptcy Matters.

                  (a) On or before three Business Days after the execution of
this Agreement, the Sellers shall file a motion with the Bankruptcy Court
seeking entry of an order in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A (with such
changes thereto as Purchaser shall approve in its reasonable discretion, the
"Approval Order"). Each Seller agrees to file an affidavit of service with the
Bankruptcy Court within three days thereafter that indicates the name and
address of each Person upon whom notice of the motions seeking entry of the
Approval Order was served, the method of service and includes any and all proofs
of such service.

                  (b) [Intentionally Omitted.]

                  (c) Purchaser and the Sellers agree to make promptly any
filings, to take all actions and to use their reasonable best efforts to obtain
entry of the Approval Order and any and all other approvals and orders necessary
or appropriate for the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby;
provided, however neither Purchaser nor any Purchaser Affiliate shall be
required to cease operating or divest itself of any of its businesses or assets.
Each Seller shall provide each applicable taxing authority in each jurisdiction
in which it is subject to Tax with copies of any motion for entry of the
Approval Order or any other order relating to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement at least 10 days prior to the hearing on such motion.

                  (d) If the Approval Order or any other orders of the
Bankruptcy Court relating to this Agreement shall be appealed by any Person (or
a petition for certiorari or motion for rehearing, reargument or stay shall be
filed with respect thereto), each Seller agrees to take all steps as may be
reasonable and appropriate to defend against such appeal, petition or motion,
and Purchaser agrees to cooperate in such efforts. Each party hereto agrees to
use its reasonable best efforts to obtain an expedited resolution of such
appeal, provided that nothing herein shall preclude the parties hereto from
consummating the transactions contemplated herein if the Approval Order shall
have been entered and have not been stayed and Purchaser has waived in writing
the requirement that the Approval Order be a Final Order in which event
Purchaser shall be able to assert the benefits of Section 363(m) of the
Bankruptcy Code as a consequence of which such appeal shall become moot.

                  5.13 Tax Payments. From and after the Closing Date, the
Sellers shall use that portion of the Purchase Price placed in escrow pursuant
to Section 2.6 to pay and discharge all personal property, ad valorem and other
Tax payments for which any Seller is responsible pursuant to Section 2.5 and
Section 5.3(c).

                  5.14 Confirmations. Between the date of this Agreement and the
Closing, the Sellers shall engage an independent accounting firm, acceptable to
Purchaser, that shall attempt to obtain from each of the Top 30 Obligors
identified on Schedule 5.14(2) under the Financing Contracts of the type
specified in the definition of Purchased Financing Contracts, without giving
effect to clause (H)(y) of the proviso thereof, a confirmation in the form
attached hereto as Schedule 5.14 (that has been completed with the appropriate
data) (a "Lease Confirmation"), or a confirmation of such information by the
Obligor verbally to the extent deemed satisfactory to Purchaser in its sole
discretion, of the validity of the data set forth in such Lease Confirmation,
and each Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with
such accounting firm to obtain such Lease Confirmations; provided, however, the
Sellers shall not be required to request or obtain a Lease Confirmation with
respect to any Financing Contract that (i) has a remaining unexpired term of
twelve (12) months or less from May 31, 2002, (ii) has reached the end of its
original lease term and is being billed on a month-to-month basis or pursuant to
an extension or renewal of the lease term which does not have a fixed renewal or
extension term of more than twelve (12) months remaining from May 31, 2002. The
Sellers' shall, or shall cause such accounting firm to, deliver to Purchaser,
true and correct copies of the Lease Confirmations sent to and received from Top
30 Obligors. The Sellers and Purchaser hereby agree that the process of
obtaining Lease Confirmations pursuant to this Section 5.14 with respect to the
Top 30 Obligors shall be substantially similar to the process agreed to by the
parties and in effect, as of the date of this Agreement, for the obtaining of
Lease Confirmations pursuant to that certain Asset Purchase Agreement
(Electronics), dated as of January 23, 2002 (as amended, restated or otherwise
modified), between Purchaser and Comdisco and that certain Asset Purchase
Agreement (Lab and Scientific), dated as of January 23, 2002 (as amended,
restated or otherwise modified), between Purchaser and Comdisco. Purchaser
acknowledges and agrees that the Sellers shall not be required to obtain Lease
Confirmations with respect to any Financing Contracts between any Seller and any
Obligor other than the Top 30 Obligors.

                  5.15 [Intentionally Omitted.]

                  5.16 [Intentionally Omitted.]

                  5.17 [Intentionally Omitted.]

                  5.18 [Intentionally Omitted.]

                  5.19 Schedule of Credit Enhancements. The Sellers shall have
delivered an updated Schedule 3.18(d) (updated as of the date of delivery
thereof) not more than 10 days and not less than 3 days prior to Closing.

                  5.20 [Intentionally Omitted.]

                  5.21 [Intentionally Omitted.]

                  5.22 Original Master Leases. From and after the Closing (or
Second Closing, if applicable), Purchaser shall hold, and shall cause the
applicable Purchaser Affiliate to hold, all original master lease agreements and
applicable schedules and Credit Enhancements thereto delivered to Purchaser or
the applicable Purchaser Affiliate at the Closing for the benefit of the
applicable Sellers solely to the extent such original documents relate to a
Financing Contract that is an Excluded Asset. Purchaser shall permit, and shall
cause the applicable Purchaser Affiliate to permit, upon the written request of
the Sellers, any Seller to use such original master lease agreements or
applicable schedules and Credit Enhancements thereto for the purposes of
enforcing such Seller's rights under any Financing Contract that is an Excluded
Asset. Such Seller shall return to Purchaser or the applicable Purchaser
Affiliate any original master lease or applicable schedules and Credit
Enhancements thereto promptly following such time as such Seller no longer
requires such master lease, schedule or Credit Enhancement for the purposes
described herein. In the event Purchaser (or any Purchaser Affiliate) and any
Seller require an original master lease agreement or schedule or Credit
Enhancement thereto in order to commence, pursue or enforce concurrent actions
against a particular Obligor or guarantor (or such Obligor's Affiliates or any
provider of such Credit Enhancement) under a Financing Contract, Purchaser and
shall cause its Purchaser Affiliates and the Sellers shall to cooperate with one
another in connection with the use of such original documents pursuant to such
concurrent actions.

                  5.23 Purchased Discounted Financing Agreements. At the
Closing, the Sellers shall deliver to Purchaser all original documents
evidencing the Purchased Discounted Financing Agreements.

                  5.24 Closing Date Portfolio Information. Within 30 days after
each Closing Date, the Sellers shall deliver to Purchaser the Closing Date
Portfolio Tape, and the Portfolio Information, as of the Closing Date, described
in items (A) through (E) of the definition thereof.

                  5.25 Administrative Claims. All amounts to be paid to
Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement shall constitute an allowed administrative
expense claim with priority over any and all administrative expenses of the kind
specified in Sections 503, 507 and 1114 of the Bankruptcy Code, and shall be, at
Purchaser's option and as otherwise permitted by this Agreement, (i) immediately
payable if and when any such obligation of any Seller arises under this
Agreement or (ii) credited against any amounts owed by Purchaser to any Seller
pursuant to this Agreement.

                                   ARTICLE VI

                             CONDITIONS TO CLOSING;
                         ABANDONMENT OF THE TRANSACTION

                  6.1 The Closing.

                  (a) Unless this Agreement has been terminated and the
transactions herein abandoned pursuant to Article 7, the Closing of the sale of
the Purchased Assets hereunder shall (subject to Sections 6.2 and 6.3) be held
at the offices of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom (Illinois) or such other
location as the parties may mutually agree upon, on the last Business Day in the
month that the conditions to Closing have been satisfied or waived (other than
those conditions that by their nature cannot be satisfied until the Closing, but
subject to all such conditions having been satisfied or waived at the time of
the Closing), or at such other times as the parties may mutually agree. If any
of the conditions specified in Section 6.2 hereof have not been satisfied,
Purchaser may nevertheless at its election waive such conditions and proceed
with the transactions contemplated hereby, and, if any of the conditions
specified in Section 6.3 hereof have not been satisfied, the Sellers may
nevertheless at their election waive such conditions and proceed with the
transactions contemplated hereby. Any such election to proceed shall be
evidenced by a certificate executed on behalf of the electing party by its
authorized representative.

                  (b) Purchaser and the Sellers shall hold a second closing (the
"Second Closing") on the last Business Day of the month immediately following
the month in which the initial Closing occurs or at such other date as the
parties may mutually agree. At the Second Closing, provided the conditions in
Section 6.2 and 6.3 have been satisfied or waived, the Sellers shall transfer to
Purchaser, or a Purchaser Affiliate, such Financing Contracts that did not meet
the requirements of a Purchased Financing Contract on the Closing Date (and
accordingly were not transferred on the Closing Date) but which do meet the
requirements of a Purchased Financing Contract at such Second Closing.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 6.1(b), in
the event that the Second Closing shall not have occurred on or before June 30,
2002, either party hereto, by written notification to the other, may terminate
the obligations hereunder to effect the Second Closing and the transactions
contemplated thereby. In the event of the termination of such obligations
pursuant to this Section 6.1(b), no party hereto shall have any liability or
further obligation to any other party to this Agreement resulting from such
termination except no party waives any claim or right against a breaching party
to the extent that such termination results from the breach by a party hereto of
any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in
this Agreement.

                  6.2 Conditions to Purchaser's Obligations to Close. The
obligations of Purchaser or the Purchaser Affiliates to purchase the Purchased
Assets and to otherwise consummate the Closing shall be subject to the following
conditions:

                  (a) Except to the extent waived in writing by Purchaser
hereunder, (i) the representations and warranties of each Seller contained
herein (other than the representation and warranty contained in Section 3.7(a))
shall be true and correct in all respects at the Closing (without giving effect
to any materiality, Seller's Knowledge or Material Adverse Effect qualifications
or exceptions contained in such representations and warranties), in each case
with the same effect as though made at and as of such time (other than
representations and warranties that are made as of a specific date, which need
be true and correct as of such date), except where the failure to be true and
correct has not had, and is not likely to have, a Material Adverse Effect and
(ii) there shall not have occurred any effect, result, occurrence, event, fact,
set of facts or change that would constitute a Material Adverse Effect between
the date of this Agreement and the Closing; each Seller shall have performed in
all material respects all obligations and complied in all material respects with
all covenants required by this Agreement to be performed or complied with by
such Seller at or prior to the Closing (except to the extent waived hereunder in
writing by Purchaser); and each Seller shall have delivered to Purchaser a
certificate of such Seller in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
Purchaser, dated the Closing Date, and signed on behalf of such Seller by its
authorized representative, in his (or her) respective representative capacity,
and not individually, to all such effects and certifying the satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in this Section 6.2 (except to the extent waived hereunder
in writing by Purchaser). For the avoidance of doubt, the Sellers and Purchaser
agree that for the purpose of determining whether representations and warranties
are true and correct in all respects at Closing, any Purchased Assets
transferred to Purchaser or any Purchaser Affiliate at a prior Closing shall not
be deemed a Purchased Asset at a subsequent Closing.

                  (b) (i) On the Closing Date, there shall be no injunction,
writ, preliminary restraining order or other order in effect of any nature
issued by a Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction directing that the
transactions provided for herein or any portion thereof not be consummated as
provided herein.

                  (ii) (A) No action or proceeding shall have been instituted
         and, at what would otherwise have been the Closing Date, remain pending
         before a Governmental Entity, (1) to restrain, prohibit or otherwise
         challenge the sale of the Purchased Assets to Purchaser or the
         performance of the material obligations of the parties hereto, or (2)
         seeking substantial damages from Purchaser or any of its Affiliates as
         a result of the sale of the Purchased Assets to the Purchaser or the
         performance of the material obligations of the parties hereto;
         provided, that, damages of $10 million or more with respect to Taxes or
         any indemnities with respect thereto shall be deemed substantial
         damages for purposes of this clause (2), and (B) and no Governmental
         Entity shall have notified either party to this Agreement that the
         consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby would constitute a
         violation of the laws of the United States or any State thereof or the
         laws of the jurisdiction to which such Governmental Entity is subject
         and that it intends to commence proceedings to restrain the
         consummation of such transactions, to force divestiture if the same are
         consummated or to materially modify the terms or results of such
         transactions unless such Governmental Entity shall have withdrawn such
         notice, or has otherwise indicated in writing that it will not take any
         action, prior to what would otherwise have been the Closing Date;
         provided, further, if any such action or proceeding shall have been
         instituted and, at what would otherwise have been the Closing Date,
         remain pending before a Governmental Entity, Purchaser may, at its
         option, elect to exclude such assets (and related liabilities) from the
         Purchased Assets and Assumed Liabilities notwithstanding the
         definitions thereof to the extent necessary to enable the conditions
         set forth in this subparagraph (b)(ii)(B) to be satisfied.

                  (c) All Authorizations, consents and approvals referred to in
Section 3.4 hereof (without giving effect to any qualifications for materiality
with regard to Authorizations, consents or approvals from any Governmental
Entity), shall have been obtained and all Authorizations required for the valid
consummation by each Seller and Purchaser of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (including, without limitation, the expiration of any applicable
waiting period under the HSR Act and similar legislation in other jurisdictions
shall have been obtained; provided, however, if any requisite Authorizations,
consents and approvals of any Governmental Entity required for the acquisition
by Purchaser or a Purchaser Affiliate of a portion of the Purchased Assets shall
not have been obtained by the Closing, Purchaser may, at its option, elect to
exclude such assets (and related liabilities) from the Purchased Assets and
Assumed Liabilities notwithstanding the definitions thereof to the extent
necessary to enable the conditions set forth in this subparagraph (c) to be
satisfied.

                  (d) On the Closing Date, the Seller shall have (i) delivered
to Purchaser or any Purchaser Affiliate (1) the original master lease, original
applicable schedules and original Credit Enhancements thereto (other than master
leases, schedules and Credit Enhancements related to any Purchased Discounted
Financing Agreement to the extent copies thereof certified as true, correct and
complete by an officer of the applicable Seller, have been provided to Purchaser
and in the case of master leases that are not the subject of any Purchased
Discounted Financing Agreement, to the extent copies of master leases certified
as true, correct and complete by the applicable Obligor have been provided to
Purchaser, in all cases if such original master leases are not in Sellers'
possession) and the documents, to the extent in the possession of any Seller
described on Schedule 5.1(a) with respect to each Purchased Financing Contract
that Seller has in its possession, and (2) any and all escrows, deposits,
security, impounds, accounts or other or additional collateral relating to each
Purchased Financing Contract (in each case that is a Purchased Asset); and (ii)
executed, acknowledged and delivered to Purchaser or any Purchaser Affiliate the
Transfer Agreements and such other transfer instruments or documents as may be
necessary to transfer, or evidence the transfer, of each Purchased Financing
Contract and each other Purchased Asset to Purchaser or any Purchaser Affiliate,
all in such form as Purchaser or its counsel may reasonably request specifically
identified to the Sellers by Purchaser at least 60 days prior to Closing; and
(iii) executed and delivered to Purchaser or any Purchaser Affiliate UCC-1
financing statements naming Purchaser, and/or an applicable Purchaser Affiliate,
as the "purchaser" and each Seller as the "seller" and describing the Purchased
Assets in the United States, to be filed with the Secretary of State of the
State of Illinois and the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. Delivery
to Purchaser of any document described on Schedule 5.1(a) other than the
original master lease, applicable schedules and Credit Enhancements thereto
described above shall not be a condition to Closing.

                  (e) Since the date of the Approval Order, there shall not have
occurred any effect, result, occurrence, event, fact, set of facts or change
that constitutes a Material Adverse Effect.

                  (f) Each Seller shall have executed the Transitional Services
Agreement.

                  (g) [Intentionally Omitted.]

                  (h) [Intentionally Omitted.]

                  (i) The Approval Order and any other orders of the Bankruptcy
         Court with respect to this Agreement shall have been entered, shall be
         in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser, and shall
         have each become a Final Order.

                  (j) Each Seller that is domiciled in the United States shall
have delivered a certificate of non-foreign status in accordance with Section
1445 of the Code, and any similar state required documents requested by the
Purchaser.

                  (k) [Intentionally Omitted.]

                  (l) At the Closing, the Sellers shall provide Purchaser with
(i) a copy of the Approval Order that has been certified by the Clerk of the
Bankruptcy Court and (ii) a copy of the Bankruptcy Court's docket for the
eleven-day period subsequent to entry of the Approval Order that has been
certified by the Clerk of the Bankruptcy Court or, if the Closing has not
occurred on the thirteenth day following entry of the Approval Order on the
Bankruptcy Court's docket, a copy of the Bankruptcy Court's docket certified by
the Clerk of the Bankruptcy Court for the period commencing on and including the
date of entry of the Approval Order through and including the date that is two
days before the Closing.

                  6.3 Conditions to Sellers' Obligations to Close. The

         laws of any foreign country, or the laws of the jurisdiction to which
         such Governmental Entity is subject and that it intends to commence
         proceedings to restrain the consummation of such transactions, to force

         have become final and nonappealable; or

                  (iii) if the initial Closing shall not have occurred on or

liability or further obligation to any other party to this Agreement resulting
from such termination except (i) that the provisions of this Section 7.2,
Section 5.8, and the provisions of Article 8 hereof shall remain in full force
and effect and (ii) no party waives any claim or right against a breaching party
to the extent that such termination results from the breach by a party hereto of

securities exchange or any stock exchange regulations. 8.9 Severability. If at
any time subsequent to the date hereof, any provision of this Agreement shall be
held by any court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or
unenforceable, such provision shall be of no force and effect, but the
illegality or unenforceability of such provision shall have no effect upon and
shall not impair the enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement.

                  8.10 Binding Effect. This Agreement and the covenants, terms
and conditions set forth herein shall be binding upon and shall inure to the
benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted

                  8.12 No Third Party Beneficiary. This Agreement is not
intended and shall not be construed to confer upon any Person other than the
parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder except that the parties hereto
agree and acknowledge that the agreements and covenants contained in Section 5.4
are, subject to Articles 7 and 8 hereof, intended for the benefit of the
indemnified parties referred to therein (each such Person, a "Third Party
Beneficiary"), and that, subject to Articles 7 and 8 hereof, each such
indemnified party, although not a party to this Agreement, shall be and is
hereby constituted a direct and irrevocable third-party beneficiary of the
agreements and covenants contained in Section 5.4 and shall have the right to
enforce such agreements and covenants against the applicable party thereto in
all respects fully and to the same extent as if such Third Party Beneficiary
were a party hereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement (including
but not limited to Section 5.4 hereof) may be amended or waived by Purchaser and
the Sellers at any time and from time to time in accordance with Section 8.1
hereof and any such amendment or waiver shall be fully effective with respect to
the rights of the Third Party Beneficiaries under Section 5.4 hereof.

                  8.13 Conveyancing Documents. No provision contained in any
conveyancing document delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall affect in any
manner whatsoever any of the indemnification provisions contained herein.

                  8.14 Expenses. Except as otherwise specifically set forth in
this Agreement, the Sellers and Purchaser will each be responsible for the
