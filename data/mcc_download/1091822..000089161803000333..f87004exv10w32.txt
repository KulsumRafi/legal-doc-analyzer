         Section 8.1       Limitations on Dissolution. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, the bankruptcy (as defined in the Act) of the
Member or a Special Member shall not cause the Member or Special Member,
respectively, to cease to be a member of the Company

                                       13
<PAGE>
and upon the occurrence of such an event, the Company shall continue without
dissolution. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary,
upon the occurrence of any event that causes the Member to cease to be a member
of the Company, (a) the person or entity acting as an Independent Manager
pursuant to Section 6.1 shall, without any action of any person or entity and
simultaneously with the Member's ceasing to be a member of the Company,
automatically be admitted to the Company as a Special Member and shall continue
the Company without dissolution, and (b) the personal representative of such
Member is hereby authorized to, and shall, within 90 days after the occurrence
of the event that terminated the continued membership of such Member in the
Company, appoint a person or entity as a substitute member of the Company (the
"Substitute Member"). The Special Member may not resign from the Company or
transfer its rights as Special Member unless (i) a successor Special Member has
been admitted to the Company as Special Member by executing a counterpart to
this Agreement, and (ii) such successor has also accepted its appointment as
Independent Manager pursuant to Section 6.1; provided, however, the Special
Member shall automatically cease to be a member of the Company upon the
admission to the Company of a Substitute Member but shall not thereby cease to
be an Independent Manager. The Special Member shall be a member of the Company
that has no interest in the profits, losses and capital of the Company and has
no right to receive any distributions of Company assets. Pursuant to Section
18-301 of the Act, the Special Member shall not be required to make any capital
contributions to the Company and shall not receive a limited liability company
interest in the Company. The Special Member, in its capacity as Special Member,
shall have the right to vote on, approve or otherwise consent to any action by,
or matter relating to, the Company, including, without limitation, the merger,
consolidation or conversion of the Company. In order to implement the admission
to the Company of the Special

                                       14
<PAGE>
Member, the person or entity acting as an Independent Manager pursuant to
Section 6.1 shall execute a counterpart to this Agreement. Prior to its
admission to the Company as Special Member, the person or entity acting as an
Independent Manager pursuant to Section 6.1 shall not be a member of the
Company. Upon the occurrence of any event that causes the last remaining member
of the Company to cease to be a member of the Company, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, the personal representative of such member is hereby
authorized to, and shall, within 90 days after the occurrence of the event that
terminated the continued membership of such member in the Company, agree in
writing (i) to continue the Company, and (ii) to the admission of the personal
representative or its nominee or designee, as the case may be, as a substitute
member of the Company, effective as of the occurrence of the event that
terminated the continued membership of the last remaining member of the Company
in the Company. Under no circumstances shall any Substitute Member or any
Special Member have any power to directly or indirectly cause a Reinstatement as
defined in the Modified Building 3 Lease.

existence, validity, construction and operating effect, and the rights of each
of the parties hereto, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of Delaware.

of this Agreement, the Member agrees that this Agreement constitutes a legal,
valid and binding agreement of the Member, and is enforceable against the Member
by the Independent Manager, in accordance with its terms.
