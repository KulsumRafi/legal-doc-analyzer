     WHEREAS, pursuant to the Bankruptcy Plan and in connection with the

immediately and irrevocably contributed 250,000 shares of Series A Convertible
Preferred Stock of the Company to the Plan; and

     WHEREAS, Section 9.01 of the Plan provides that the Board of Directors of

     WHEREAS, the Board now desires to amend the Plan effective January 1, 2003,

     NOW, THEREFORE, the Board hereby adopts the Plan as follows:

<PAGE>

                                    ARTICLE I
                                   Definitions

     When used herein, the following terms shall have the following meanings
unless the context clearly indicates otherwise:

     Section 1.01 Affiliated Entity - An entity, regardless of whether or not
such entity has adopted the Plan, within the controlled or affiliated service
group of an Employer, as determined by Sections 414 (b), (c), (m) and (o) of the
Code and, solely for purposes of Section 3.03, as determined under the rules set
forth in Section 415 (h) of the Code.

     Section 1.02 Annual Compensation - The total of cash compensation including
bonuses and overtime paid to a Member by an Employer during the Plan Year
(regardless of when earned) while a Member of the Plan, and reported on the
Member's Form W-2 for income tax purposes plus all amounts not includable as
gross income by reason of Section 402 (a) (8) of the Code for deferrals made
under Section 401 (k) of the Code and all amounts not includable as gross income
under Section 125 of Section 134(f) of the Code, but excluding commissions,
reimbursement for expenses and Employer contributions paid under this Plan or
any qualified deferred compensation plan or any welfare plan, except as provided
above. In any Plan Year in which a Member was not a Member of the Plan at the
beginning of the year, his Annual Compensation shall be deemed to be
remuneration as determined above for that portion of the Plan Year during which
he is a Member.

     Notwithstanding the above, the Annual Compensation of each Member taken
into account under the Plan shall not exceed the two hundred thousand dollar
($200,000) limit under Section 401(a)(17)(A) of the Code, as such amount shall
from time to time be adjusted by the Secretary of the Treasury for increases in
the cost-of-living in accordance with Section 401(a)(17)(B) of the Code (the
"401(a)(17) Limit"). If Annual Compensation shall be determined over a period
that contains less than 12 calendar months, the annual limit on Annual
Compensation shall be an amount equal to the 401(a)(17) Limit for the calendar
year in which the period begins multiplied by the ratio obtained by dividing the
number of full months in the period by 12. Annual Compensation shall not include
earnings from an Employer during any period when an Employee was not a Member.
For the first Plan Year of a Member's participation in the Plan only, (i) if the
Member's Entry Date is January 1 of such Plan Year, such Member's Annual
Compensation shall be limited under the Plan to the full amount of the
401(a)(17) Limit, and (ii) if the Member's Entry Date is July 1 of such Plan
Year, such Member's Annual Compensation shall be limited under the Plan to
one-half of the amount of the 401(a)(17) limit. The cost-of-living adjustment in
effect for a calendar year shall apply to Annual Compensation for the
determination period that begins with or within such calendar year.

     Section 1.03 Beneficiary - The person designated to receive payments in the
event of the death of a Member, as more fully set forth in Section 6.06 hereof.

     Section 1.12  Effective Date - The Effective Date of the Plan shall be

shall be January 1, 2003.

who is covered by a collective bargaining agreement between employee
representatives and any Employer which does not specifically provide for
participation of the represented Employees in the Plan or (ii) a Leased
Employee.

     Section 1.14  Eligible Rollover Distribution - Any distribution of all or
any portion of the balance of a qualified pension plan (within the meaning of
Section 3(2) of ERISA) to the credit of the Distributee, except that an Eligible
Rollover Distribution does not include: any distribution that is one of a series
of substantially equal periodic payments (not less frequently than annually)
made for the life (or life expectancy) of the Distributee or the joint lives (or
joint life expectancies) of the Distributee and the Distributee's designated
Beneficiary, or for a specified period of ten (10) years or more; any
distribution to the extent such distribution is required under Section 401(a)(9)
of the Code; and the portion of any distribution that is not includable in gross
income (determined without regard to the exclusion for net unrealized

determined in accordance with the rules set forth in Department of Labor
Regulations Section 2530.200b-2(b) and shall be credited to the Employee for the

than the computation period in which the award, agreement or payment is made, as

                                  Contributions

     Section 3.01 Employer Contributions - The contribution, if any, by an
Employer to the Trust for each Plan Year shall be the amount fixed by each
Employer or otherwise made by the Company on behalf of each Employer. Such
contribution amount may be recorded in terms of a dollar amount, a percentage of
income for the Plan Year, a percentage of compensation paid or accrued to
Members for the Plan Year, in shares of Company Stock or any combination
thereof. If an Employer determines to make a contribution for any Plan Year (or
a contribution is made on behalf of an Employer), such contribution shall not
exceed twenty-five percent (25%) of the compensation (as defined in Section
404(a)(3) of the Code) paid or accrued to all Members of the Plan who are
Employees of such Employer in respect of said taxable year plus allowable credit
and contribution carryovers, as provided in Section 404(a)(3) of the Code.

     Section 3.02 Allocations - The contributions of an Employer with respect to
a Plan Year made pursuant to Section 3.01 shall be allocated to the Individual
Account of Members (i) who are Eligible Employees of the Employer on the last
day of the Plan Year for which such contribution is made or (ii) who are among
the Members that were Eligible Employees of the Employer during the Plan Year
(a) who retired pursuant to Sections 6.01 or 6.02 or (b) who died during the
Plan Year. Contributions made by or on behalf of an Employer shall be allocated
to each such Member's Individual Account in the ratio to which each such
Member's Annual Compensation bears to the Annual Compensation of all such
Members for such Plan Year.

     Section 3.03 Maximum Annual Additions - The maximum "annual addition", as
hereinafter defined, for any Member shall be the lesser of $40,000 or
one-hundred percent (100%) of the Member's compensation. For purposes of this
Section 3.03, the term "compensation" shall include the total of a Member's
wages, salary and other remuneration for personal services received during the
Plan Year from the Employer and Affiliated Entities, including amounts deferred
pursuant to Section 401(k) or Section 125 of the Code.

     The "annual addition" for a Member shall be the sum of (i) Employer and
Affiliated Entities' contributions for such Member for the Plan Year (including
deferrals under Section 401(k) of the Code) to defined contribution plans and
(ii) forfeitures allocated to the account of such Member and resulting from
forfeiture provisions of defined contribution plans, if any. If the annual
addition for a Member exceeds the limitations set forth above, reductions shall
be made first to other defined contribution plans before a reduction is made
with respect to allocations under the Plan.

     In the event of a miscalculation of a Member's total Annual Compensation
for a Plan Year, which would result in the maximum permitted annual additions
being exceeded, the excess shall be allocated to a suspense account for the
benefit of the Member whose allocation would otherwise exceed the limits set
forth herein. Such suspense account shall not be valued pursuant to Article V
and no gains and losses of the Trust Fund shall be allocated to such suspense
account. The suspense account on behalf of a Member shall be allocated to the
Individual Account of the Member on the next succeeding Valuation Date, to the
extent that an allocation would otherwise be made pursuant to Section 3.02;
provided the limitations of this Section 3.03 shall not be exceeded.
Notwithstanding anything contained herein or in the Trust Agreement to

                                        8

<PAGE>

the contrary, if the Plan is or is regarded as terminated, amounts held in such
suspense account shall be allocated to the Individual Accounts of Members on the
date of termination according to the allocation provisions of Section 3.02.

     In the event that the Secretary of the Treasury, or his delegate, shall
adjust or has adjusted the $40,000 limits imposed herein to reflect
cost-of-living increases, such limits shall be increased automatically hereunder
effective as of the first day of the Plan Year during which any such adjustment
takes effect, to the same extent as provided in any announcement issued by the
Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate of an adjustment of such limits.

     For the purpose of Section 415 of the Code and this Section, calculations
shall be based on the limitation year. For all purposes, the limitation year
shall be the Plan Year.

     Section 3.04 USERRA - Notwithstanding any provisions of the Plan to the
contrary, benefit and service credit with respect to qualified military service
shall be provided in accordance with Section 414(u) of the Code.

     Section 4.01 General - The benefits in this Plan shall be provided by the
Trust Fund, which shall consist of Employer Contributions and all investments
made therewith and all proceeds thereof and all earnings and profits thereon,
less payments made therefrom. The Trust Fund shall be held in accordance with

                                Members' Accounts

     Section 5.01 Individual Accounts - The Plan Administrator shall establish
and cause to be maintained an Individual Account for each Member which shall
consist of:

     (i)  the Employer Contributions allocable to the Member; and

     (ii) the Member's allocable share of the income and expenses and realized
          and unrealized gains and losses of the Trust Fund.

The Individual Account is solely a bookkeeping account and shall represent a
Member's undivided interest in the Trust Fund.

     Section 5.02 Valuation - As of each Valuation Date, the Trustee shall
determine and report to the Plan Administrator the fair market value of the
assets of the Trust Fund and the income and expenses and realized and unrealized
gains and losses of the Trust Fund for the period from the last Valuation Date
to the current Valuation Date. The Trustee shall allocate such amount among the
respective Individual Accounts of the Members (excluding Employees who first
became Members during the Plan Year in which the Valuation Date falls) in
proportion to their respective account balances.

     Section 5.03 Termination of Participation in Trust Fund - After the
Valuation Date as of which the benefits of a Member are fully paid pursuant to
the provisions of Article VI, VII or X, such Member's Individual Account shall
be closed. Thereafter, neither the Member nor any person claiming under or
through him shall participate or have any interest in the Trust Fund.

                          Retirement and Death Benefits

     Section 6.01 Normal Retirement - Each Member who has a Separation from
Service on attainment of his Normal Retirement Date shall be entitled to a lump
sum retirement benefit which can be provided from the Member's Individual
Account.

     Section 6.02 Retirement After Normal Retirement Date - A Member may
postpone retirement and continue in an Employer's employ and participate in the
Plan after his Normal Retirement Date. In such event, the commencement of the
payment of a Member's retirement benefit shall be deferred until the Member's
Deferred Retirement Date. Upon the Member's Deferred Retirement Date, the Member
shall receive a retirement benefit as if the Member were then retiring pursuant
to Section 6.01 hereof.

     Section 6.03 Death of Member - If a Member dies before such Member's
Individual Account is distributed under the Plan, a death benefit shall be
payable to the Member's Beneficiary of the Member's Individual Account. The Plan
Administrator may require that any Beneficiary that is not the Member's Spouse
submit information as is needed to verify that the Member had no Spouse at the
time of his death or that there was a Spousal Consent to the designation of such
Beneficiary. All distributions hereunder of a Member's Individual Account shall
be made as soon as practicable following the Member's death and shall be based
on the value of the deceased Member's Individual Account determined as of the
Valuation Date coinciding with or immediately following his date of death or the
Valuation Date immediately preceding commencement of payment of benefits.

     Section 6.04 Time for Payment of Benefits and Valuation - Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, unless a Member elects otherwise, in writing,
specifying the benefit and time payment is to begin, the payment of benefits
pursuant to this Article VI to each Member shall begin not later than the later
of sixty (60) days after the close of the Plan Year in which falls (i) the
Member's Normal Retirement Date or (ii) the date the Member incurs a Separation
from Service after the Member's Normal Retirement Date (unless payment is
delayed for administrative reasons). Benefits to a Member who is a 5% owner
shall commence on the April 1 following the end of the calendar year in which
the Member attains age 70 1/2.

     The amount of any benefit payable under the Plan shall be based upon the
value of a Member's Individual Account at the Valuation Date coinciding with or
immediately preceding the commencement of payment of benefits.

     Section 6.05 Plan Benefits Paid in Cash - Notwithstanding anything in the
Plan to the contrary, including, without limitation, the provisions of Articles
VI, VII and X, all Plan benefit payments to Members shall be made in cash and
not in shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock of the Company.

     Section 6.06 Designation of Beneficiary - At any time, and from time to
time, each Member shall have the unrestricted right to designate a Beneficiary
or change a Beneficiary to whom payments of any undistributed amount of his
Individual Account shall be made in the event of the Member's death.
Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, a Member shall be

                                       12

<PAGE>

deemed to have designated his Spouse as sole Beneficiary of the Member's
Individual Account, unless the Member obtains Spousal Consent to name another
person as Beneficiary. Each such designation shall be evidenced by a written
instrument signed by the Member and be on file with the Plan Administrator
before his death. If the designated Beneficiary survives the Member, but dies
prior to receiving the full amount of the Member's Individual Account,
distribution of the amount shall be made to any successor Beneficiary previously
designated by the Member. If any Member shall fail to designate a successor
Beneficiary, the successor Beneficiary shall be deemed to be the Beneficiary's
estate. If there is no living Beneficiary or successor Beneficiary at the time
of a Member's death, the Beneficiary shall be deemed to be the Member's estate.

     Section 6.07 Incapacity - If any person to whom a benefit is payable
hereunder is an infant or if the Plan Administrator determines that any person
to whom such benefit is payable is incompetent by reason of physical or mental
disability, the Plan Administrator may cause the payments becoming due to such
person to be made to another for his benefit without responsibility of the Plan
or the Trustee to see to the application of such payment. Payment made pursuant
to this Section 6.06 shall, as to such payment, operate as a complete discharge
of the Trust Fund, the Trustee and the Plan Administrator.

     Section 6.08 Spendthrift Provision - No benefit payable under the Plan
shall, except as otherwise specifically provided by law, be subject in any
manner to anticipation, alienation, garnishment, sale, transfer, assignment,
pledge, encumbrance or discharge, and any attempt so to anticipate, alienate,
sell, transfer, assign, pledge, encumber or charge such benefit shall be void;
nor shall any benefit be in any manner liable for or subject to the debts,
contracts, liabilities, engagements or torts of the person entitled thereto.

     Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Trustee is specifically authorized to
comply with any "domestic relations order" which the Plan Administrator
determines to be a "qualified domestic relations order." For this purpose, a
"domestic relations order" shall mean any judgment, decree or order (including
approval of a property settlement agreement) within the meaning of Section
414(p) of the Code which relates to the provision of child support, alimony
payment, or marital property rights to a Spouse, former Spouse, child or other
dependent of a Member, and is made pursuant to a State domestic relations law
(including a community property law) and a "qualified domestic relations order"
shall mean a domestic relations order within the meaning of Section 414(p) of
the Code which the Plan Administrator, in its sole discretion and applying
uniform rules, determines to meet the following requirements:

     (i)  such order assigns to a Member's Spouse, former Spouse, child or other
          dependent of the Member, or creates or recognizes the existence of, a
          right to receive all or a portion of, the Member's benefits payable
          under the Plan (hereinafter referred to as the "alternate payee");

     (ii) such order clearly specifies (1) the name and last known mailing
          address (if any) of the Member and the name and mailing address of
          each alternate payee, (2) the amount or percentage of the Member's
          benefits to be paid by the Plan to each such alternate payee, or the
          manner in which such amount or percentage is to be determined, (3) the
          number of payments or the period to which such order applies, and (4)
          that the order applies to the Plan; and

                                       13

<PAGE>

     (iii) such order does not (1) require the Plan to provide any type or form
           of benefits, or any option, not otherwise provided under the Plan,
           (2) require the Plan to provide increased benefits (determined on the
           basis of actuarial value), and (3) require the payment of benefits to
           an alternate payee which are required to be paid to another alternate
           payee under another order previously determined to be a qualified
           domestic relations order.

     Upon the Plan Administrator's receipt of a domestic relations order, it
shall promptly notify the Member and any alternate payee of the receipt of such
order and the Plan's procedures for determining whether such order is a
qualified domestic relations order. The determination by the Plan Administrator
of whether a domestic relations order is a qualified domestic relations order
shall be made pursuant to written procedures adopted by the Plan Administrator.
During any period in which the issue of whether a domestic relations order is a
qualified domestic relations order is being determined, the Plan Administrator
shall separately account for the amounts which would have been payable to the
alternate payee ("segregated amounts") during such period if the order had been
determined to be a qualified domestic relations order. If within eighteen (18)
months of the date on which the first payment would be required to be made under
the domestic relations order it is determined that the order is not a qualified
domestic relations order, or the issue as to whether such order is a qualified
domestic relations order is not resolved, then the Plan Administrator shall
cause the segregated amounts (plus any interest thereon) to be paid to the
Member or his Beneficiary if payment would have otherwise been made absent such
order. Any determination thereafter that an order is a qualified domestic
relations order shall be applied prospectively only.

     Section 6.09 Proof of Claim - The Plan Administrator may require such proof
of death and such evidence of the right of any person to receive payment of a
deceased Member's interest in the Trust Fund as the Plan Administrator may deem
reasonable.

     Section 6.10 De Minimis Benefits - Notwithstanding anything contained
herein to the contrary, in the event the benefit a Member or Beneficiary is
entitled to under the provisions of this Article VI does not exceed, and has
never exceeded at the time of any prior distribution, $5,000, the Plan
Administrator shall distribute such benefit in a lump sum as soon as practicable
after a Member's Separation from Service, in lieu of any other benefits
hereunder, provided that such payment occurs prior to the participant's annuity
starting date, and such Member or Beneficiary shall then have no further
interest in the Plan with respect to the Member's employment prior to his
Separation from Service. For purposes of this Section 6.10, the value of a
Member's benefit entitlement under the Plan shall be determined without regard
to that portion of the Member's benefit that is attributable to rollover
contributions (and earnings allocable thereto) within the meaning of Sections
402(c), 403(a)(4), 403(b)(8), 408(d)(3)(A)(ii) and 457(e)(16) of the Code.

     Section 7.01 Vesting - The interest of each Member in the balance to the
credit of his Individual Account shall at all times be immediately and fully
vested.

     Section 7.02 Manner of Payment - A Member who has a Separation from Service
prior to attaining his Normal Retirement Date, other than by reason of death,
shall be entitled to the pay out of his Individual Account upon such Member's
attainment of Normal Retirement Date, in accordance with the provisions of
Article VI. Members who have a Separation from Service prior to the attainment
of their Normal Retirement Date, other than by reason of death, and whose
Individual Account does not exceed, and has never exceeded at the time of any
prior distribution, $5,000, shall have their Individual Account distributed in a
lump sum, as soon as practicable after the later of the Valuation Date following
the Member's Separation from Service or the Valuation Date following the fifth
anniversary of the Effective Date of the Plan. Such Member (or such Member's
Beneficiary) shall then have no further interest in the plan with respect to the
Member's employment prior to his Separation from Service.

     Section 7.03 Direct Rollover Transfer to Another Qualified Plan or IRA -
Pursuant to Section 401(a)(31) of the Code, under rules established by the Plan
Administrator, a Distributee may elect to have any, portion of an Eligible
Rollover Distribution paid directly to an Eligible Retirement Plan as a Direct
Rollover.

Members then employed by such Employer, except as provided in this Section
10.03. To the maximum extent permitted by law, any rights of Members no longer
employed by such Employer and of former Members and their Beneficiaries and

the Company, in its sole discretion, may elect to terminate the Trust Agreement.
In such event, each Member's Individual Account shall be paid to such Member (or
Beneficiary of a deceased Member) in a lump sum, as soon as practicable after
applicable regulatory approvals. Any unallocated shares of Company Stock then
held by the Plan shall be allocated to the Individual Accounts of all Members
immediately prior to such termination pursuant to the provisions of Section

            benefit plans included in the Required Aggregation Group, and

                    Group, and

               (ii) the Account Values of all Employees under such defined
                    contribution plans included in the Required Aggregation
                    Group, excluding for all purposes the Accrued Benefit Values
                    and Account Values of former Key Employees.

       Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 12.03, the Plan
shall not be considered a Top-Heavy Plan for any Plan Year in which it is part
of a Required Aggregation Group or Permissive Aggregation Group which is not a
Top-Heavy Group.

       The Accrued Benefit Values of Key Employees and the Account Values of Key
Employees as of the Determination Date shall be increased by the distributions
made with respect to the Employee under the Plan and any plan aggregated with
the Plan under Section 416(g)(2) of the Code during the 1-year period ending on
the Determination Date. The immediately preceding sentence shall also apply to
distributions under a terminated plan which, had it not been terminated, would
have been aggregated with the Plan under Section 416(g)(2)(A)(i) of the Code. In
the case of a distribution made for a reason other than separation from service,
death or disability, this provision shall be applied by substituting `5-year
period' for `1-year period'. The accrued benefits and accounts of any individual
who has not performed services for an Employer during the 1-year period ending
on the Determination Date shall not be taken into account.

       Section 12.04 Minimum Allocation - If the Plan is a Top-Heavy Plan in a
Plan Year, the Employer shall contribute on behalf of each Member who is not a
Key Employee for such Plan Year to the extent not otherwise contributed by the
Employer for such Plan Year on behalf of the Member to any other qualified plan
maintained by the Employer, the lesser of (a) three percent (3%) or (b) the
highest percentage of Employer contributions (including salary deferral
contributions by the Employer pursuant to Section 401 (k) of the Code) allocable
to a Key Employee for such Plan Year of each such Member's compensation up to a
maximum of $160,000 for such Plan Year within the meaning of Treas. Reg. (S)
1.415-2(d). The determination of the highest percentage of Employer
Contributions allocable to a Key Employee for a Plan Year shall be made for each
such Key Employee by dividing the contributions made on behalf of each Key
Employee by his Annual Compensation. Contributions made pursuant to this Section
12.04 to Members who are not Key Employees shall be allocated to the Individual
Accounts of Members who are Employees on the last day of the Plan Year. In the
event a

Top-Heavy Plan for the Plan Year, such Member shall not receive a minimum
allocation hereunder.
