(2)       Columbus, Texas (Rt. 2, Box 179, Alleyton, Texas): A prior
owner/operator of this facility released TPH and metals into the soil at the
property. HCLP conducted remedial activities at the property pursuant to the

storage tank is being utilized at this facility for the storage of hydro-test

Columbia Gas, was bound by a Consent Decree to remedy certain environmental
