         1.02.  REVOLVING  CREDIT  LINE.  The  Companies  agree on the terms and
conditions  hereinafter  set forth to make advances to one another and to borrow

         1.04.  INTEREST ON ADVANCES.  The rate of interest on all advances will
be a variable rate of interest that will reset daily, based upon the immediately
preceding 30-day Fed Composite A1/P1 commercial paper rate as quoted in the Wall
Street  Journal,  plus 25 Basis Points  (calculated  on the basis of actual days
elapsed and on the basis of a 360-day year).

         1.05. CONDITIONS TO ADVANCES.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein,  no party to this  Agreement  is obligated to make an advance to another
party unless,  in the sole  discretion of the lending  party,  it has sufficient
funds for short-term investment purposes and such advance will be an appropriate
investment under state regulations or corporate  investment  limitations for the
lending  party.  Any  request  for an advance  shall be in  accordance  with any
statutory  requirements  and  investment  policy  provisions  applicable  to the
borrowing and lending parties.

         1.06. CONDITIONS OF BORROWING. The maximum term of a borrowing shall be
89 days. Interest accruing on all outstanding  advances shall be due and payable
on demand by the lending  parties but, until demand is made, in arrears,  on the
last  business day of each month until the unpaid  principal  and interest  have
been paid in full. The outstanding principal balance of any advance shall be due
and payable upon demand by the lending  party.  Each  borrowing  party may, from
time to time,  prepay  all - or any  part of any  outstanding  unpaid  principal
without  penalty or  premium.  All  payments  shall be  applied  to accrued  and
outstanding interest with the balance, if any, applied to principal.

         1.07. REQUESTING ADVANCES.  Each request for an advance must be made by
an officer of the  borrowing  party and  approved  by an officer of the  lending
party in the form of the document attached hereto as Exhibit A.

         1.08.  DOCUMENTATION.  The  obligations  of any  Company  to repay  all
Advances made to it pursuant to this Agreement,  together with interest, are set
forth in this Agreement and shall be fully binding and  enforceable  without the
execution  of  any   promissory   note  or  other   evidence  of   indebtedness.
Nevertheless,  if any lending party so requests, a borrowing party hereto agrees
to duly execute and deliver to the Treasury of the lending  company a negotiable
promissory note evidencing the advances available or outstanding  hereunder,  in
form and substance  substantially similar to the Note attached hereto as Exhibit
B and satisfactory to the lending party.  Expenses incurred and payment received
shall be allocated  to each  applicable  company in  conformity  with  customary
insurance accounting practices  consistently applied and the books, accounts and
records of each  applicable  party  shall be so  maintained  as to  clearly  and
accurately  disclose  the  precise  nature  and  details  of  the  transactions,
including   such   accounting   information  as  is  necessary  to  support  the
reasonableness of the charges or fees to the respective parties.

RECORDS OF ALL LOANS THAT ARE MADE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT AND ALL MONIES PAID BACK
SHALL BE KEPT BY THE AFFILIATED COMPANY,  RELIASTAR  INVESTMENT  RESEARCH,  INC.
("RIRI") ON BEHALF OF THE PARTIES.  RIRI SHALL ALSO BE INVOLVED IN  COORDINATING
THE LOANS AND PAY-BACKS ON BEHALF OF THE PARTIES.

its date unless sooner extended by written  agreement of both parties.  Any such
extension  must have the prior  review and  approval  of the New York  Insurance
Department,  pursuant to New York Insurance Law Section  1505(d).  However,  any
party may elect to withdraw from this  arrangement by sending  written notice of
such withdrawal to the Chief  Financial  Officer of each of the other parties to

Agreement or any specific loan  transaction  requires that disclosure be made to
any state or federal regulatory agency or department, or that documents be filed
with the state or federal regulatory agency or department,  or that documents on
file with any state or federal  regulatory  agency be  amended,  then each party
