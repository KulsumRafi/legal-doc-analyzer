<PAGE>

amount  and Buyer  shall  pay the Other  Purchase  Price  Adjustments  Amount to
Seller) or is greater (in which case the Purchase Price shall be reduced by such
amount and  Seller  shall pay the Other  Purchase  Price  Adjustments  Amount to
Buyer) than the  Estimated  Other  Purchase  Price  Adjustments,  together  with
interest thereon at the Prime Rate plus 2% per annum from the Closing Date until
the date such payment is made.

     (b) Within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date,  Buyer shall deliver to
Seller the balance sheet of ALNG as of November 30, 2002 (the  "Closing  Balance
Sheet"). The Closing Balance Sheet shall be prepared in accordance with Schedule

consistent  with the  illustration  set forth in  Schedule  3.3,  including  the

Other  Purchase  Price  Adjustments  Amount  prior  to or on the  date  that  is
forty-five (45) days after the Objection Notification Date.

     (d) If Buyer and Seller  agree  prior to or on the date that is  forty-five
(45)  days  after  the  Objection  Notification  Date to a Net  Working  Capital
Adjustment  Amount,  the  Indebtedness  Adjustment  Amount and/or Other Purchase
Price  Adjustments  Amount  that is  different  from the  amount  that  would be
calculated  based upon the  Closing  Report,  the payment  described  in Section
3.3(a) shall be the agreed upon amount.

     (e) If Buyer  and  Seller  do not  agree  prior  to or on the date  that is
forty-five  (45) days after the  Objection  Notification  Date to a Net  Working
Capital  Adjustment  Amount,  the  Indebtedness  Adjustment  Amount and/or Other
Purchase Price Adjustments  Amount, as the case may be, payment shall be made by
Buyer or Seller,  as  appropriate,  with respect to all "agreed  upon" issues on
said forty-fifth (45th) day and either Party may submit the remaining matters in
dispute  (but no other  matters)  to  PriceWaterhouse  Coopers  or, if that firm
declines to act as  provided  in this  paragraph,  another  firm of  independent
public accountants  mutually acceptable to Buyer and Seller (in either case, the
"Final Arbiter"),  which firm shall make a final and binding determination as to
all  matters  in dispute  with  respect to the  calculation  of the Net  Working
Capital  Adjustment  Amount,  the  Indebtedness  Adjustment  Amount and/or Other
Purchase Price Adjustments  Amount,,  as the case may be, within forty-five (45)
days  after  its   appointment.   The  Final  Arbiter  shall  send  its  written


                                       13
<PAGE>

determination  of Net Working  Capital,  Indebtedness  and Other  Purchase Price
Adjustments to Buyer and Seller,  together with a calculation of the Net Working
Capital  Adjustment  Amount,  the  Indebtedness  Adjustment  Amount and/or Other
Purchase Price  Adjustments  Amount,  as the case may be, that results from that
determination,  at which point the  determination of the Final Arbiter,  and the
resulting  calculation  of  the  Net  Working  Capital  Adjustment  Amount,  the
Indebtedness  Adjustment Amount and/or Other Purchase Price Adjustments  Amount,
as the case may be,  shall be  binding  on Buyer  and  Seller,  absent  fraud or
manifest error.

     (f) The fees and expenses of the Final Arbiter  shall be allocated  between
Seller and Buyer so that the amount of fees and expenses  paid by Buyer shall be
equal to the product of (A) and (B),  where (A) is the aggregate  amount of such
fees and  expenses,  and where (B) is a fraction,  the numerator of which is the
amount in  dispute  that is  ultimately  successfully  disputed  by  Seller  (as
determined  by the Final  Arbiter),  and the  denominator  of which is the total
value in dispute,  and the remainder of such fees and expenses  shall be paid by
Seller.

     (g)  The  payment  of  the  Net  Working  Capital  Adjustment  Amount,  the
Indebtedness  Adjustment  Amount  and/or the Other  Purchase  Price  Adjustments
Amount,  as contemplated by paragraph (a) above (together with interest  thereon
as  provided  in such  paragraph  (a))  will be made on the day that is five (5)
Business Days after the date upon which such amount has been finally  determined
in accordance with the provisions of this Section 3.3. Such payment will be made
to  Buyer  or  Seller,  as the  case may be,  by wire  transfer  of  immediately
available  funds to an account  specified  by the Party  that is to receive  the
payment.

compliance obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business;  (vi) except
as would not have a Material Adverse Effect,  there are no conditions on, about,
beneath or arising from any real property  currently or formerly owned,  used or
leased by ALNG which might give rise to liability, the imposition of a statutory
lien or which may require any  investigation,  removal or remedial  action under

ALNG are in compliance  with  Environmental  Laws.  All USTs located on property
currently  owned or leased by ALNG that are no  longer  active,  and which  were
closed  by Seller  or its  Affiliates,  have  been  closed  in  compliance  with
Environmental  Laws.  To the  Knowledge of Seller,  all USTs located on property
currently owned or leased by ALNG that are no longer active, and which have been

Environmental Laws by or in connection with any contract or agreement.

     (g) Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary set forth in this Article IV,
Seller makes no  representation  or warranty to Buyer relating to  Environmental
Laws,  Permits  under  Environmental  Laws,  or Hazardous  Materials  other than
pursuant  to this  Section  4.8,  which  is  intended  to  contain  the sole and
exclusive  representations  and warranties of Seller  relating to  Environmental
Laws, Permits under Environmental Laws, and Hazardous Materials.

Section 4.9.         Employees


     ALNG does not currently have any employees. ALNG is not the sponsor of, nor

beneficiary  of any  extension  of time  within  which to file any income Tax or
other material Tax Return. All Taxes due and owing by ALNG (whether or not shown
on any Tax Return) have been timely paid in full. ALNG has withheld and paid all
amounts  required to be withheld  and paid in  connection  with  amounts paid or
owing to any employee, independent contractor,  creditor, equity holder or other
third  party as  required by  applicable  Laws.  ALNG does not have in force any
waiver of any statute of  limitations  in respect of Taxes or any  extension  of

any Tax Returns filed on a consolidated or combined basis),  examination reports
and  statements  of  deficiencies  assessed  against  or agreed to by ALNG since

                                       19
<PAGE>

federal, state and local income Tax purposes since October 17, 2002, the date of

the part of Buyer.

Section 4.12.        Material Contracts


     Schedule 4.12 lists each Material Contract to which ALNG is a party. Seller
has provided or made available to Buyer true and correct copies of each Material
Contract  identified on Schedule 4.12 and each amendment thereto,  and a written

Contract  is in full force and effect and is a valid and binding  obligation  of
ALNG, and to Seller's Knowledge, the other party or parties thereto, enforceable
in accordance with its terms in all material respects.  ALNG is not in breach or
default in any material respect in the performance of its duties and obligations
under any Material Contract. To Seller's Knowledge, none of the other parties to
any  Material  Contract is in breach or default in any  material  respect in the
performance of its duties and obligations under any Material Contract.  No party
to any Material  Contract has given notice to ALNG or made a claim  against ALNG
with respect to a breach or default  thereunder  and there exists no  condition,
event or  occurrence  that,  after  notice  or lapse  of  time,  or both,  would
constitute  such a breach or default by ALNG or, to the Knowledge of Seller,  by
any  party  to any  such  Material  Contract.  No  Material  Contract  has  been
terminated,  canceled or revoked and no material term thereof has been waived or
modified  in any  material  respect.  To the  Knowledge  of Seller,  no Material
Contract has been threatened to be terminated, cancelled or revoked by any other
party to such Material Contract.

Section 4.13.        Bank Accounts; Directors and Officers


     Schedule 4.13 lists all accounts (and all signatories  thereto)  maintained
by ALNG  with  any  bank,  brokerage  firm or  other  financial  institution  or

Section 4.14.        Title to and Condition of Properties

     (a) Seller has provided  Buyer with a complete and correct list of all real
property  formerly  owned,  leased,  operated  or  controlled  by  ALNG  or  its
predecessors  in interest by virtue of merger or  conversion.  Schedule  4.14(a)
lists all of the real property (i) to which ALNG has fee title;  provided, as to
the real property  referenced in item 2 of Schedule 4.14(a),  ALNG owns whatever


                                       20
<PAGE>

right,  title and interest  that was  conveyed to ALNG  pursuant to the document
referenced in such item 2 of Schedule 4.14(a) (the "Fee Property"), (ii) that is
leased or  subleased  by ALNG (the  "Leased  Property")  or (iii)  that ALNG has
agreed (or has an option) to lease or sublease,  or may be obligated to lease or
sublease.  ALNG is the sole legal and equitable owner of the leasehold interests
in the Leased Property  (including,  without limitation,  the leasehold interest
pursuant to the Ground Lease from Providence Gas Company to ALNG dated March 31,
1999).  The Fee  Property  is free and  clear of all Liens  (including,  without
limitation, rights-of-way, easements, exceptions, encumbrances and other matters
affecting  title)  arising by,  through or under ALNG or any of its  Affiliates,
except for (a) Liens listed on Schedule 4.14(a), (b) Liens for Taxes not yet due
or being  contested in good faith by appropriate  proceedings,  and (c) Liens of
mechanics,  materialmen,  carriers,  warehousemen,  and similar Liens arising by
operation  of Law  that in  each  case  secure  payments  not  yet due or  being
contested in good faith by  appropriate  proceedings  ("Permitted  Liens").  The
leasehold estates of ALNG in the Leased Property are free and clear of all Liens
(including,   without   limitation,   rights-of-way,    easements,   exceptions,
encumbrances and other matters affecting title), except for Permitted Liens.

     (b) Other than ALNG,  there are no other  parties in  possession of the Fee
Property,  the Leased Property,  or any portion or portions thereof,  and on the
Closing Date the fee estate in the Fee Property and the leasehold estates in the
Leased  Property  will be free  and  clear  of any and all  lessees,  licensees,
occupants  or  tenants  except as set forth on  Schedule  4.14(a).  There are no
pending or, to Seller's Knowledge,  threatened  condemnation,  eminent domain or
other Legal  Proceedings  affecting the Fee Property,  the Leased Property,  the
Leased Improvements or any portion or portions thereof.  Neither ALNG nor any of
its  Affiliates  has  received  notice of any  pending or  threatened  requests,
applications  or  proceedings  to alter or  restrict  any  zoning  or other  use
restrictions  applicable to the Leased Property or the Leased  Improvements that
would  interfere  with the conduct of the business of ALNG or the ALNG Facility,
in any material respect. Neither ALNG nor any of its Affiliates has received any
notice  from  any  Governmental  Authority  or  other  Person  that  the use and
occupancy of the Leased Property as currently used and occupied, violates in any
material respect any deed or easement  restrictions or covenants,  or applicable
Law, including building codes, zoning,  subdivision or other land use or similar
Laws. Except as set forth on Schedule 4.14(a),  to the Knowledge of Seller,  all
water,  sewer, gas, electric,  telephone,  drainage and other utility equipment,
facilities  and services  required by Law or necessary  for the operation of the

pursuant to valid Permits (to the extent  Permits are required  therefor) and no

Effect.  The assets of ALNG,  including  the ALNG  Facility,  are  sufficient to
operate the business of ALNG as it is  presently  operated  consistent  with the
historical practice of ALNG.

     (d) ALNG has good  title to all of its  tangible  and  intangible  personal
property  (including the tangible and intangible  personal property reflected on
the FERC Forms 2-A or acquired since December 31, 2001,  except property sold or

the provisions of such policies.  No pending claims made by or on behalf of ALNG
against  any of the  insurance  policies  listed  or  required  to be  listed on
Schedule  4.15 have been denied or are being  defended  against by third parties

     (g) change in its financial condition,  assets,  liabilities or business or
any other event or  condition  of any  character  which  individually  or in the

Section 4.18.        Accounts Receivable and Accounts Payable


     All  accounts  receivable  of  ALNG in  existence  as of the  Closing  Date
(whether  reflected on the  Financial  Statements  or  otherwise)  (i) represent
services  actually  rendered or sales  actually  made in the ordinary  course of
business or valid claims as to which full performance has been rendered and (ii)
are less than sixty (60) days old. The reserves against the accounts  receivable
are  commercially  reasonable and have been  determined in accordance  with RAP,
consistently  applied.  Except  to the  extent  reserved  against  the  accounts
receivable or as reflected by prepayments or unused credits, no counterclaims or
offsetting claims with respect to the accounts receivable are pending or, to the
Knowledge of Seller,  threatened.  The accounts payable of ALNG reflected on the
Interim  Financial  Statements arose from bona fide transactions in the ordinary
course of business, and all such accounts payable have been paid, or are not yet
due and payable  under  ALNG's  payment  policies and  procedures,  or are being


                                       23

to the Knowledge of Seller, there is no valid basis for any such claim; and (iv)
except as may be provided in the Material Contracts, ALNG is not liable, nor has

adversely altering the terms of its relationship with ALNG.

Section 6.1.         Covenants

     (a) Seller's Access to Documents; Preservation of Books and Records.

          (i) For a period of five (5)  years  from the date  hereof,  (A) Buyer
     shall cause ALNG not to dispose of or destroy any of the material books and
     records  of ALNG  relating  to periods  prior to the  Closing  ("Books  and
     Records") without first offering to turn over possession  thereof to Seller


                                       27
<PAGE>

     by written notice to Seller at least thirty (30) days prior to the proposed

     allow Seller and its agents  reasonable  access,  at Seller's  expense,  to

          (ii) The five-year  period  referred to in Section  6.1(a)(i) shall be
     extended  with respect to the relevant  Books and Records in the event that
     Seller advises Buyer in writing that any Legal  Proceeding or investigation
     is pending or threatened at the  termination of such  five-year  period and
     such  extension  shall  continue  with  respect to the  relevant  Books and
     Records until any such Legal Proceeding or  investigation  has been settled
     through judgment or otherwise and/or is no longer pending or threatened.

     (b) Certain Employees.

          (i) Offers and Severance.  Schedule  6.1(b) sets forth those employees
     of DEOC who spend a majority of their time providing field-related services
     with  respect to the ALNG  Facility  ("ALNG  Employees").  The current base
     salary paid to each such ALNG  Employee is set forth  opposite  the name of
     such ALNG  Employee on the schedule  provided by Seller to Buyer via e-mail
     dated December 10, 2002. On or after the date hereof, Buyer or its designee
     shall  interview each of the ALNG  Employees and shall offer  employment to
     those  individuals  as  Buyer  shall  determine  in  its  sole  discretion;
     provided,  however,  that Buyer or its  designee  shall  complete  all such
     interviews  and make offers of  employment,  if any, to the ALNG  Employees
     prior to  termination  of the  field-related  services under the Transition
     Services  Agreement  (the  "Termination  Date").  With respect to each ALNG
     Employee, if any, who does not receive an offer of employment from Buyer or
     its designee prior to or on the  Termination  Date, if DEOC  terminates the
     employment  of such ALNG  Employee no later than thirty (30) days after the
     Termination Date, then Buyer shall reimburse Seller for one hundred percent
     (100%) of the amount of the severance  benefits to which such ALNG Employee
     is  entitled  under  the  2001-2002  Duke  Energy  Corporation   Transition
     Severance  Benefit Plan, as such plan exists on the date hereof,  up to the
     maximum  amount set forth  opposite  the name of such ALNG  Employee on the
     schedule provided by Seller to Buyer by email dated November 1, 2002. Buyer
     and ALNG shall have no other obligations with respect to ALNG Employees who
     do not receive an offer of employment  from Buyer or its designee and shall
     have no obligations at all with respect to ALNG Employees who do not accept
     an offer of employment  from Buyer or its  designee.  Buyer or its designee
     shall employ each such  individual  accepting  Buyer's (or its  designee's)
     offer of  employment  (collectively,  the  "Transferred  Employees")  as of
     January 1, 2003 or such later date as Buyer and Seller may agree,  provided


                                       28
<PAGE>

     that any such  later  date  shall in any  event be the first day of a month
     (the "Employment  Commencement  Date") at the same rate of base pay paid to
     them  by  Seller  on  the  Closing  Date;  provided,   however,  that  such
     Transferred  Employees shall in all events be employees at will of Buyer or
     its designee.

          (ii)  Benefits  for  Transferred   Employees.   Effective  as  of  the
     Employment  Commencement  Date , except as  specifically  provided  herein,
     Buyer  shall  cause  each  such  Transferred  Employee  to be  eligible  to
     participate in all of Buyer's  Employee  Benefit Plans,  and other employee
     plans, programs, policies, and practices, including severance, vacation and
     sick leave, on substantially the same basis as similarly situated employees
     of Buyer.

          (iii) Past Service Credit.

               (A)  Except for  employee  pension  benefit  plans (as defined in
                    ERISA),  Buyer shall cause all of its Employee Benefit Plans
                    and other employee plans, programs, policies, and practices,
                    including  but not limited to  severance,  vacation and sick
                    leave, in which the Transferred  Employees  participate,  to
                    recognize past service as recognized by the employee  plans,
                    programs, policies and practices of DEOC on the date hereof,

                    enrollment,  eligibility  for, or for the  commencement  of,
                    benefits,  and  eligibility for the levels of benefits where
                    there are  service-related  benefit  schedules in effect and
                    for any other purpose for which service is considered  under
                    such plans, programs, policies and practices.

               (B)  Buyer shall cause all of its Employee Benefit Plans that are
                    employee  pension  benefit  plans (as  defined  in ERISA) in
                    which the  Transferred  Employees  participate  to recognize
                    past service as recognized by the employee  pension  benefit
                    plans of DEOC for purposes of  eligibility  to  participate,
                    eligibility   for   enrollment,   eligibility  for  vesting,
                    eligibility for  commencement  of benefits,  and eligibility
                    for benefit  accrual  credits under the Buyer's cash balance
                    plan and for the forms of benefits  where such  credits,  or
                    the amount of such credits, or payments from the plan depend
                    in whole or in part on service.

               (C)  Upon the date each Transferred Employee commences employment
                    with Buyer, Buyer shall provide coverage to such Transferred
                    Employee under Buyer's group health  insurance plans and, as
                    may be necessary to effect such  coverage,  shall waive,  or
                    caused to be waived, any pre-existing condition restrictions
                    relating to Buyer's group health insurance plans.

     shall be the  responsibility  of  Buyer  and its  employee  plans or of the
     carrier or carriers under the Employee Benefit Plans of Buyer.

          (ii) DEOC shall have no  liability  under Title X of the  Consolidated
     Omnibus  Budget  Reconciliation  Act of 1985,  as  amended  ("COBRA")  with
     respect to any  continuation  coverage  under any medical or health plan of
     Buyer for  Transferred  Employees,  their  spouses,  their  dependents  and
     beneficiaries.  Buyer shall have no  liability  under Title X of COBRA with
     respect to any  continuation  coverage under any medical or health plans of
     DEOC for those individuals who do not become Transferred  Employees,  their
     spouses, their dependents and beneficiaries.

     (e) Seller's Marks.

          (i) Buyer shall not acquire, nor shall ALNG retain,  reserve, or hold,
     any rights or licenses to the names,  servicemarks,  and trademarks "Duke,"
     "Duke Energy," "Algonquin" or any derivatives or variations thereof as well
     as any designs,  trade dress,  or logos used by Seller or any  Affiliate in
     association   with  the  foregoing  names,   servicemarks,   or  trademarks
     (collectively  "Seller  Marks")  or any  names,  servicemarks,  trademarks,
     designs,  trade dress,  or logos  similar  thereto.  As soon as  reasonably
     practicable  after the Closing (and in any event, not later than forty-five


                                       30
<PAGE>

     (45) days  thereafter),  Buyer will cause ALNG to amend its  organizational
     documents to the extent  necessary  to remove the  Seller's  Marks from the
     name of ALNG and to remove all trademarks,  trade names and symbols related
     to the Seller Marks from the properties and assets (including all signs) of
     ALNG,  and otherwise to cease all use of or right to use the Seller's Marks
     or any other terms that are confusingly  similar  thereto.  Contemporaneous
     with the Closing, ALNG shall execute an assignment of all right, title, and
     interest in the form of Exhibit G in and to the Mark "Algonquin," including
     all goodwill associated therewith,  subject to ALNG's rights to temporarily
     use such Mark during the forty-five  day period  described in the preceding
     sentence.

          (ii) To the extent that any Seller Marks are used by ALNG in operating
     its business on stationery,  signage, equipment, invoices, receipts, forms,
     packaging,  advertising and promotional  materials,  product,  training and
     service literature and materials, software or like materials (collectively,
     "Marked  Materials")  or appear on any  inventory of ALNG,  Seller grants a
     non-exclusive,  limited  license to ALNG to use any such  remaining  Marked
     Materials or to sell such  inventory for a period not to exceed  forty-five
     (45) days after the Closing, provided that (1) ALNG shall not without prior
     written  consent of Seller use such Seller Marks in any other manner during
     such  time;  and (2) Buyer  shall  within  forty-five  (45) days  after the
     Closing Date cause ALNG not to use any Marked Materials (other than signage
     on equipment  and on training  materials or software for internal use only)
     without  first  crossing out or marking over such Seller Marks or otherwise
     clearly  indicating  on such  Marked  Materials  that  ALNG is no longer an
     Affiliate  of or  affiliated  with Seller.  After the Closing,  Buyer shall
     cause ALNG not to reorder any Marked Materials. Within forty-five (45) days
     following  the  Closing,  Buyer  shall  cause  ALNG to replace or alter any
     signage to remove any  reference  to any Seller  Marks and shall remove any
     Seller Marks from any equipment, training materials or software.

     (f) Insurance.  From and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall not, and shall
cause ALNG not to,  make any claim  under any  policy or  program  of  insurance
maintained by Seller or any of its Affiliates  regardless of whether ALNG may be
a named  insured  or  additional  insured  under  any such  policy  or  program;
provided,  the preceding  provision  shall not apply with respect to any demand,
claim or Legal Proceeding  described or required to be described in Schedule 4.7
and which is covered by any of the insurance referred to in Schedule 4.15.

     (g) Seller  shall have the right to cause the  tangible  personal  property
described in Schedule 6.1(g) to be removed from the ALNG Facility and, following
such removal,  ALNG will have no further use of such items of personal property;
provided,  prior to the  termination  of the  Transition  Agreement  those items
described in Schedule  6.1(g) that are  necessary  for the operation of the ALNG
Facility as it has  historically  been operated  shall not be removed;  provided
further,  the  foregoing  shall not require  Seller or any of its  Affiliates to
renew or extend any lease of any such item.


                                       31

     (h) From and after  December 1, 2002,  Seller  shall not permit ALNG (i) to
distribute  to Seller or any partner of Seller by way of dividend,  distribution
or otherwise any cash,  accounts receivable or other assets of Seller other than
the bank accounts (and cash contained therein) and accounts receivable described
in Exhibit G or (ii) to incur any Indebtedness.  In connection with the Closing,
Seller shall cause the applicable parties to execute the assignment  attached as
Exhibit G and a copy of the same shall be provided to Buyer.

                                  ARTICLE VII
                                   TAX MATTERS

Section 7.1.         Preparation and Filing of Tax Returns

     (a) Seller shall  prepare or cause to be prepared all income Tax Returns of
ALNG for all  periods  ending  on or prior to the  Closing  Date and cause to be
included in such income Tax Returns or in the  consolidated  federal  income Tax
Returns   (and  the  state   income  Tax  Returns  of  any  state  that  permits
consolidated,  combined  or unitary  income Tax  Returns,  if any) of the Seller
Group, all items of ALNG's income, gain, loss, deduction or credit ("Tax Items")
that are  required  to be included  therein for all periods  through the Closing
Date (the  "Pre-Closing Tax Period"),  shall cause such income Tax Returns to be
timely filed with the appropriate Taxing  Authorities,  and shall be responsible
for the timely payment (and entitled to any refund) of all income Taxes due with
respect to the periods covered by such income Tax Returns.

     (b) Seller  shall  prepare or cause to be prepared  all Tax Returns of ALNG
for all periods  ending on or prior to the Closing Date that are filed after the
Closing Date and are not income Tax Returns  described  in paragraph  (a) above.
Seller  shall  deliver a copy of each such Tax  Return to Buyer at least  thirty
(30) days  prior to the due date  (including  extensions)  for  filing  such Tax
Return.  Seller shall permit Buyer to review and comment on any such Tax Returns
and shall make such revisions to such Tax Return as are reasonably  requested by
Buyer.  Buyer shall cause ALNG to timely file such Tax Returns  and,  subject to
this Section 7.1(b) and Section  7.3(a),  pay all Taxes due with respect to such
Tax Returns. Seller shall promptly pay to Buyer the amount, if any, by which the
unpaid Taxes on any such Tax Return  exceeds the sum of (x) the amounts  accrued
for such Taxes on the Closing Balance Sheet and (y) any amounts  previously paid
by Seller to Buyer in respect of accrued ad valorem  and sales  taxes of ALNG as
part of Other Purchase Price Adjustments,  or Buyer shall promptly pay to Seller
the amount,  if any, by which the unpaid Taxes  reflected on any such Tax Return
are less than the sum of (x) the  amounts  accrued for such Taxes on the Closing
Balance Sheet, and (y) any amounts previously paid by Seller to Buyer in respect
of accrued ad valorem  and sales taxes of ALNG as part of Other  Purchase  Price
Adjustments.

     (c) With respect to any Tax Return  covering a taxable period  beginning on
or before  the  Closing  Date and  ending on or after the  Closing  Date that is
required to be filed after the Closing  Date with  respect to ALNG,  Buyer shall
cause such Tax  Return to be  prepared  in a manner  consistent  with  practices
followed in prior years,  except as otherwise  required by Law or fact (or where
such inconsistency  would not result in any additional Tax liability to Seller),
shall  cause to be  included  in such Tax  Return all Tax Items  required  to be
included therein, and at least thirty (30) days prior to the due date (including


                                       32
<PAGE>

extensions)  of such Tax  Return  shall  furnish  a copy of such Tax  Return  to
Seller.  Buyer shall permit  Seller to review and comment on such Tax Return and
shall make such revisions to such Tax Return as reasonably  requested by Seller.
Buyer shall cause ALNG to timely file each such Tax Return with the  appropriate
Taxing Authority,  and, subject to this Section 7.1(c) and Section 7.3(a), shall
be  responsible  for the  timely  payment  of all Taxes due with  respect to the
period  covered  by such Tax  Return.  Seller  shall  promptly  pay to Buyer the
amount,  if any, by which the unpaid Taxes  attributable  to the Pre-Closing Tax
Period  exceed the amount  accrued  for such Taxes on the Closing  Date  Balance
Sheet or Buyer shall  promptly  pay to Seller the  amount,  if any, by which the
unpaid Taxes attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period are less than the amount
accrued for such Taxes on the Closing Date Balance Sheet.

     (d) To the extent  permitted  by Law or  administrative  practice,  (i) the
taxable  year of ALNG that  includes the date hereof shall be treated as closing
on (and including) the Closing Date, and (ii) all transactions occurring outside
the ordinary course of business on the Closing Date after the Closing shall have
occurred shall be reported on Buyer's  consolidated United States federal income
tax return and shall be similarly  reported on other Tax Returns of Buyer or its
Affiliates.

     (e) The portion of the Taxes for any period that includes, but does not end
on,  the  Closing  Date (the  "Straddle  Period")  that is  attributable  to the
Pre-Closing  Tax  Period  shall be: (i) in the case of Taxes that are either (x)
based upon or related to income or receipts,  or (y) imposed in connection  with
any sale or other transfer or assignment of property (real or personal, tangible
or intangible), deemed equal to the amount which would be payable if the taxable
period  ended on and included  the Closing  Date;  and (ii) in the case of Taxes
imposed  on a periodic  basis or  otherwise  measured  by the level of any item,
deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire  period (or, in the case of
such  Taxes  determined  on an arrears  basis,  the amount of such Taxes for the
immediately  preceding period),  multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which
is the number of days in the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the denominator of which
is the number of days in the entire taxable period.

     (f) If after the Closing Date Buyer or ALNG receives a refund or utilizes a
credit of any Tax  attributable to a Pre-Closing Tax Period that is in excess of
the amount, if any,  reflected as a Tax asset on the Closing Date Balance Sheet,
Buyer shall pay to Seller  within ten (10)  Business  Days after such receipt an
amount equal to such refund  received or credit  utilized  (or, in the case of a
Straddle  Period,  so much of such refund or credit as relates to the portion of
the taxable  period  ending on or before the Closing  Date),  together  with any
interest  received  or  credited  thereon,  less the costs  incurred by Buyer in
obtaining such refund on Seller's behalf and the amount of any Taxes,  including
federal income Taxes,  imposed on the receipt of such refund.  Buyer shall,  and
shall cause ALNG to, at Seller's expense, take such action to obtain a refund or
credit  attributable  to a  Pre-Closing  Tax  Period or to  mitigate,  reduce or
eliminate  any  Taxes  that  could  be  imposed  for a  Pre-Closing  Tax  Period
(including  with  respect  to  the  transactions   contemplated  hereby)  as  is
reasonably requested by Seller.

Section 7.2.         Access to Information

     (a) After  the  Closing,  Seller  shall  grant to Buyer (or its  designees)
access at all  reasonable  times to all of the  information,  books and  records
relating  to ALNG  within  the  possession  of  Seller  or  Seller's  Affiliates
(including work papers and correspondence  with Taxing  Authorities),  and shall
afford Buyer (or its designees) the right (at Buyer's  expense) to take extracts
therefrom  and to make copies  thereof,  to the extent  reasonably  necessary to
permit Buyer (or its designees) to prepare Tax Returns, to conduct  negotiations
with Taxing  Authorities,  and to implement the provisions of, or to investigate
or defend any claims between Buyer and any other Buyer Tax  Indemnitees,  on the
one hand, or Seller on the other hand, arising under this Agreement.

     (b) After the  Closing,  Buyer shall grant or cause ALNG to grant to Seller
(or its  designees)  access at all reasonable  times to all of the  information,
books and  records  relating  to ALNG  within  the  possession  of Buyer or ALNG
(including work papers and correspondence  with Taxing  Authorities),  and shall
afford  Seller  (or its  designees)  the right  (at  Seller's  expense)  to take
extracts  therefrom  and  to  make  copies  thereof,  to the  extent  reasonably
necessary to permit Seller (or its designees) to prepare Tax Returns, to conduct
negotiations  with Tax  authorities,  and to implement the  provisions of, or to
investigate  or  defend  any  claims  between  Buyer  or  any  other  Buyer  Tax
Indemnitees,  on the one hand,  or Seller on the other hand,  arising under this
Agreement.

     (c) Each of Buyer and Seller will preserve and retain all  schedules,  work
papers and other  documents  relating to any Tax  Returns of or with  respect to
ALNG or to any  claims,  audits  or  other  proceedings,  or other  Tax  matters
affecting  ALNG until the  expiration of the statute of  limitations  (including
extensions)  applicable to the taxable period to which such documents  relate or
until the final  determination  of any controversy  with respect to such taxable
period,  and until the final  determination of any payments that may be required
with respect to such taxable  period under this  Agreement.  Each of the Parties
will give the other  Party  reasonable  written  notice  prior to  transferring,
destroying  or  discarding  any such  material and, if so requested by the other
Party,  allow  the other  Party  (at its  expense)  to take  possession  of such
materials.

     (d) Nothing in this Section 7.2 is intended to limit the obligations of the
Parties with respect to the delivery of, or the  provision of access to,  books,
records and other information under any other Section of this Agreement.

Section 7.3.         Indemnification by Seller

     (a)  Seller,  jointly  and  severally,  shall  indemnify,  defend  and hold
harmless Buyer, ALNG and any members of any group filing consolidated,  combined
or unitary, federal, state or local income Tax Returns with Buyer (collectively,
the "Buyer Tax  Indemnitees")  from and against all Losses  attributable  to (i)
Taxes of ALNG for any  Pre-Closing  Tax  Period,  (ii) Taxes of any member of an
affiliated,  consolidated,  combined or unitary  group that ALNG was a member of
prior to the Closing Date,  including  pursuant to Treasury  Regulation  Section
1.1502-6 or any analogous or similar state,  local or foreign Law or regulation,
(iii) Taxes of any other Person imposed on ALNG as a transferee or successor, by


                                       34
<PAGE>

contract or otherwise,  which Taxes relate to an event or transaction  occurring
before the Closing, or (iv) any breach of any representation or warranty made in
Section  4.10or any covenants or agreements  made by Seller in this Article VII;
provided, however, that Seller shall be liable for and shall indemnify the Buyer
Tax Indemnitees with respect to Losses described in clauses (i)-(iii) above only
to the extent that the amount of such Losses  exceeds the sum of (x) the amounts
accrued  as a  liability  for  Taxes on the  Closing  Balance  Sheet and (y) any
amounts  previously paid by Seller to Buyer in respect of accrued ad valorem and
sales taxes of ALNG as part of Other  Purchase Price  Adjustments.  Seller shall
reimburse  the  appropriate  Buyer Tax  Indemnitee  for any Losses which are the
responsibility  of  Seller  pursuant  to this  Section  7.3(a)  within  five (5)
Business  Days  after the  payment  of such  Taxes by the Buyer Tax  Indemnitee;
provided,  however,  that in the case of any such Losses  attributable  to Taxes
shown on any Tax Return  described in Section 7.1 (b) or Section 7.1(c),  Seller
shall  reimburse the  appropriate Tax Indemnitee for such Taxes prior to the due
date for the filing of such Tax Return.

     (b)  Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary in this Agreement,  no claim
for Taxes shall be  permitted  under this Section 7.3 unless such claim is first
made not later  than  sixty (60) days  after the  expiration  of the  applicable
statute of limitations (including extensions) with respect to such Taxes.

Section 7.4.         Buyer Tax Indemnification


     Buyer agrees to protect,  defend,  indemnify and hold harmless  Seller from
and against,  and agrees to pay all Losses attributable to (a) any Taxes of ALNG
that are not  attributable  to a Pre-Closing  Tax Period,  and (b) any liability
arising from a breach by Buyer of its covenants set forth in this Article VII.

Section 7.5.         Tax Indemnification Procedures

     (a) If a claim, audit,  examination or other proceeding ("Tax Claim") shall
be made by any  Taxing  Authority  that,  if  successful,  would  result  in the
indemnification  of a Party (or other Buyer Tax Indemnitee) under this Agreement
(referred to herein as the "Tax Indemnified  Party"),  the Tax Indemnified Party
shall promptly  notify the party  obligated under this Agreement to so indemnify
(referred  to herein as the "Tax  Indemnifying  Party") in writing of such fact;
provided,  however,  that the failure of the Tax Indemnified  Party to so notify
the Tax Indemnifying Party shall not release the Tax Indemnifying Party from its
obligations  hereunder  except  to  the  extent  that  such  failure  materially
prejudices the Tax Indemnifying Party's position.

     (b) The Tax  Indemnified  Party  shall,  at its sole cost,  be  entitled to
contest  all Tax Claims  except that the Tax  Indemnifying  Party shall have the
right,  at its sole cost,  to control the defense,  prosecution,  settlement  or
compromise  of any Tax contest that is related  exclusively  to the liability of
any Taxes , the entire amount of which the Tax Indemnifying  Party  acknowledges
in advance in writing is recoverable from the Tax Indemnifying  Party hereunder.
If the Tax Indemnifying  Party provides such written  acknowledgement to the Tax
Indemnified  Party,  the  Tax  Indemnified  Party  shall  take  such  action  in
connection  with  contesting  a Tax Claim as the Tax  Indemnifying  Party  shall


                                       35
<PAGE>

reasonably  request in writing  from time to time,  including  the  selection of
counsel and experts and the  execution of powers of attorney,  provided that the
Tax Indemnifying Party shall have agreed to pay to the Tax Indemnified Party all
costs and expenses  that the Tax  Indemnified  Party incurs in  connection  with
contesting such Tax Claim, including, without limitation,  reasonable attorneys'
and accountants' fees and disbursements.  The Tax Indemnified Party may elect to
participate,  at its  sole  cost,  in any  Tax  contest  controlled  by the  Tax
Indemnifying  Party with counsel of its choice.  The Tax Indemnified Party shall
not make any payment of such claim for at least 30 days (or such shorter  period
as may be required by applicable Law) after the giving of the notice required by
Section  7.5(a),  shall  give  to the Tax  Indemnifying  Party  any  information
reasonably  requested relating to such claim, and otherwise shall cooperate with
the Tax  Indemnifying  Party in good faith in order to contest  effectively  any
such claim. With respect to any Tax Claims for which a Tax Indemnifying Party is
partially liable,  the Tax Indemnifying  Party may elect to participate,  at its
sole cost,  in any Tax  contest  controlled  by the Tax  Indemnified  Party with
counsel  of its  choice  and the Tax  Indemnified  Party  may not  enter  into a
settlement  of  such a Tax  Claim,  without  the  written  consent  of  the  Tax
Indemnifying Party, which consent will not be unreasonably  withheld;  provided,
however,  that if the Tax Indemnified Party notifies the Tax Indemnifying  Party
that it  wishes  to  settle  such a Tax  Claim  and the Tax  Indemnifying  Party
reasonably  refuses to consent to such settlement,  the Tax  Indemnifying  Party
shall be  required to continue  such Tax  contest at its sole  expense,  and the
indemnification  obligation of the Tax  Indemnifying  Party shall be expanded to
include any Taxes incurred by the Tax Indemnified  Party in excess of the amount
computed  as though the  settlement  for which such  consent was sought had been
implemented.

     (c) Subject to the provisions of Section 7.5(b),  the Tax Indemnified Party
shall  only  enter  into a  settlement  of a contest of a Tax Claim that the Tax
Indemnifying Party has the right to control with the applicable Taxing Authority
or prosecute  such contest to a  determination  in a court or other  tribunal of
initial or appellate  jurisdiction as instructed by the Tax Indemnifying  Party;
provided,  however,  that  if  the  Tax  Indemnifying  Party  notifies  the  Tax
Indemnified  Party that it wishes to settle a Tax contest,  the Tax  Indemnified
Party  may elect to  continue  such Tax  contest  at its sole  expense,  and the
indemnification obligation of the Tax Indemnifying Party shall be limited to the
amount of such indemnification  obligation computed as though the settlement for
which such consent was sought had been implemented.

     (d) If,  after  actual  receipt by the Tax  Indemnified  Party of an amount
advanced by the Tax Indemnifying  Party pursuant to this Section 7.5, the extent
of the liability of the Tax Indemnified Party with respect to the claim shall be
established  by the final  judgment or decree of a court or other  tribunal or a
final and binding settlement with an administrative  agency having  jurisdiction
thereof,  the Tax Indemnified Party shall promptly repay to the Tax Indemnifying
Party the  amount  advanced  to the  extent of any  refund  received  by the Tax
Indemnified  Party with respect to the claim together with any interest received
thereon from the applicable Taxing Authority and any recovery of legal fees from
such Taxing  Authority,  net of any Taxes as are  required to be paid by the Tax
Indemnified  Party  with  respect  to  such  refund,   interest  or  legal  fees
(calculated  at the  maximum  applicable  statutory  rate of Tax in the  year of
recovery without regard to any other Tax Items).

(the  "Indemnifying  Party")  of any Third  Party  Claim  asserted  against  the
Indemnified Party which could give rise to a right of indemnification under this
Agreement and (ii) transmit to the Indemnifying  Party, a written notice ("Claim
Notice")  describing  the nature of the Third Party Claim,  a copy of all papers
served  with  respect to such claim (if any),  and the basis of the  Indemnified
Party's request for indemnification under this Agreement.

     (b)  Within  thirty  (30)  days  after  receipt  of any Claim  Notice  (the
"Election  Period"),  the Indemnifying  Party shall notify the Indemnified Party
(i) whether the  Indemnifying  Party  disputes  its  potential  liability to the
Indemnified  Party under this  Agreement  with respect to such Third Party Claim
and (ii) whether the Indemnifying Party desires, at the sole cost and expense of
the Indemnifying Party, to defend the Indemnified Party against such Third Party
Claim.

     (c) If the  Indemnifying  Party notifies the  Indemnified  Party within the
Election  Period that the  Indemnifying  Party does not  dispute  its  potential
liability  to  the   Indemnified   Party  under  this  Agreement  and  that  the
Indemnifying  Party elects to assume the defense of the Third Party Claim,  then
the  Indemnifying  Party  shall have the right to  defend,  at its sole cost and
expense,  such  Third  Party  Claim  by  all  appropriate   proceedings,   which
proceedings shall be prosecuted  diligently by the Indemnifying Party to a final
conclusion or settled at the discretion of the Indemnifying  Party in accordance
with this Section 8.3.  The  Indemnifying  Party shall have full control of such
defense  and  proceedings   including  any  compromise  or  settlement  thereof;
provided, however, that any such compromise or settlement involving non-monetary
obligations of the Indemnified  Party, or otherwise  having a direct effect upon
its continuing  operations,  shall be subject to the consent of the  Indemnified
Party. The Indemnified Party is hereby authorized,  at the sole cost and expense
of the  Indemnifying  Party, to file,  during the Election  Period,  any motion,
answer or other pleadings  which the  Indemnified  Party shall deem necessary or
appropriate  to protect its  interests  or those of the  Indemnifying  Party and
which are not unnecessarily  prejudicial to the Indemnifying Party. If requested


                                       38

by the  Indemnifying  Party,  the Indemnified  Party shall, at the sole cost and
expense of the Indemnifying Party, cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and its
counsel in contesting any Third Party Claim which the Indemnifying  Party elects
to  contest,   including,   without  limitation,   the  making  of  any  related
counterclaim  against  the  Person  asserting  the  Third  Party  Claim  or  any
cross-complaint  against any Person.  The Indemnified  Party may participate in,
but not control,  any defense or settlement of any Third Party Claim  controlled
by the Indemnifying  Party pursuant to this Section 8.3 and, except as permitted
above or pursuant to this  Section  8.3,  shall bear its own costs and  expenses
with respect to such participation.

     (d) If the Indemnifying  Party fails to notify the Indemnified Party within
the Election Period that the Indemnifying Party elects to defend the Indemnified
Party  pursuant to this  Section  8.3, or if the  Indemnifying  Party  elects to
defend the Indemnified Party pursuant to Section 8.3 but fails to diligently and
promptly  defend or settle the Third Party  Claim,  then the  Indemnified  Party
shall have the right to defend, at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying
Party, the Third Party Claim.  The Indemnified  Party shall have full control of
such defense and proceedings;  provided, however, that the Indemnified Party may
not enter into,  without the Indemnifying  Party's  consent,  which shall not be
unreasonably  withheld,  conditioned or delayed, any compromise or settlement of
such Third Party  Claim.  The  Indemnifying  Party may  participate  in, but not
control, any defense or settlement  controlled by the Indemnified Party pursuant
to this  Section 8.3,  and the  Indemnifying  Party shall bear its own costs and
expenses with respect to such participation.

     (e) In the  event an  Indemnified  Party  should  have a claim  against  an
Indemnifying  Party  hereunder  which does not involve a Third Party Claim,  the
Indemnified  Party shall  transmit to the  Indemnifying  Party, a written notice
(the "Indemnity Notice") describing the nature of the claim and the basis of the
Indemnified  Party's request for  indemnification  under this Agreement.  If the
Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days
from its receipt of the Indemnity  Notice that the  Indemnifying  Party disputes
such claim, the claim specified by the Indemnified Party in the Indemnity Notice
shall  be  deemed  a  liability  of the  Indemnifying  Party  hereunder.  If the
Indemnifying  Party has timely  disputed  such claim,  as provided  above,  such
dispute  shall be resolved by litigation  in an  appropriate  court of competent
jurisdiction.

     (f) Payments of all amounts  owing by the  Indemnifying  Party  pursuant to
Section  8.3(c) and Section 8.3(d) shall be made not later than thirty (30) days
after  the  latest  of (A) the  settlement  of the Third  Party  Claim,  (B) the
expiration of the period for appeal of a final  adjudication of such Third Party
Claim or (C) the expiration of the period for appeal of a final  adjudication of
the  Indemnifying   Party's  liability  to  the  Indemnified  Party  under  this
Agreement.  Payments of all amounts owing by the Indemnifying  Party pursuant to
Section  8.3(e)  shall be made  not  later  than  thirty  (30)  days  after  the
expiration of the  thirty-day  Indemnity  Notice period or, if the  Indemnifying
Party has timely disputed such claim, the expiration of the period for appeal of
a final  adjudication of the Indemnifying  Party's  liability to the Indemnified
Party under this Agreement.

     (g) The failure to provide notice as provided in this Section 8.3 shall not
excuse any party from its continuing obligations  hereunder;  however, any claim
shall be reduced by the damages  resulting from such party's delay or failure to
provide notice as provided in this Section 8.3.

     (h)  Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary in this Section 8.3,  should
any Third Party Claim hereunder  involve a situation where the Indemnified Party
reasonably  anticipates  that part of the claim  will be borne by it and part of
the claim will be borne by the  Indemnifying  Party due to the  existence of the
limitations in Section 8.4, the parties shall jointly  consult and proceed as to
any such Third Party Claim.

Section 8.4.         Limits on Indemnification


     Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement:

     (a) Seller shall not have any  obligation  to provide  indemnification  for
Losses  pursuant to Section 8.1(a) or Section 8.1(e) (to the extent  incurred in
connection with Section  8.1(a)) except to the extent that the aggregate  amount
of all such Losses pursuant to such subsections exceeds $250,000.00 (the "Basket
Amount"),  in which case Seller shall be liable to Buyer only for such Losses in
excess of the Basket Amount; provided, however, that the Basket Amount shall not
apply with respect to any breach of Section  4.3(a)(iii) or Section  4.3(a)(iv).
The  maximum  obligation  of Seller to  provide  indemnification  for all Losses
pursuant  to  Section  8.1(a) or  Section  8.1(e)  (to the  extent  incurred  in
connection with Section 8.1(a)) shall be limited to an aggregate amount equal to
$10,000,000.00  (the  "Liability  Cap").  Without  prejudice  to  the  foregoing
limitations, Seller shall not have any obligation to provide indemnification for
Losses to the extent such Losses are accrued or reserved  for in the Net Working
Capital Adjustment Amount determined pursuant to Section 3.3.

     (b) Buyer  shall not have any  obligation  to provide  indemnification  for
Losses  pursuant to Section 8.2(a) or Section 8.2(d) (to the extent  incurred in
connection with Section  8.2(a)) except to the extent that the aggregate  amount
of all such Losses pursuant to such  subsections  exceeds the Basket Amount,  in
which case Buyer shall be liable to Seller only for such Losses in excess of the
Basket Amount.  The maximum obligation of Buyer to provide  indemnification  for
Losses  pursuant to Section 8.2(a) or Section 8.2(d) (to the extent  incurred in
connection with Section 8.2(a)) shall be limited to the Liability Cap.

     (c) Neither  Party  shall have any  obligation  to provide  indemnification
hereunder for any Losses pursuant to Section 8.1(a), Section 8.1(b) (solely with
respect to  breaches  of the  representations  and  warranties  in Section  4.1,
Section 4.2 and Section 4.3(a)),  Section 8.2(a) and Section 8.2(b) (solely with
respect to  breaches  of the  representations  and  warranties  in Section  5.1,
Section  5.2,  and  Section  5.3)  hereof  for which a  written  notice of claim
specifying in reasonable  detail the specific nature and basis of the Losses and
the estimated amount of such Losses is not delivered to the  Indemnifying  Party
prior to 5:00 p.m.,  Eastern Time, on the eighteen (18) month anniversary of the
date hereof; provided, however, that such indemnities shall survive with respect
only to the specific matter that is the subject of any notice  delivered in good


                                       40
<PAGE>

faith in compliance  with the  requirements of this Section 8.4(c) prior to 5:00
p.m.,  Eastern  Time on such  eighteen  (18)  month  anniversary  date until the
earlier to occur of (i) the date on which a final  nonappealable  resolution  of
the matter described in such notice has been reached,  or (ii) the date on which
the matter described in such notice has otherwise reached final resolution;  and
provided  further  that (x) the  representations  and  warranties  set  forth in
Section 4.5,  Section 4.11,  Section 4.17,  and Section 5.8 hereof shall survive
until ninety (90) days after the end of the  applicable  statute of  limitations
period, (y) the  representations and warranties set forth in Section 4.14(a) and
4.14(d)  hereof shall survive until the second  anniversary  of the Closing Date
and (z) the  representations  and  warranties  set  forth in  Section  4.8 shall
survive until the second anniversary of the date hereof.

     (d) The obligation of either Party to provide indemnification hereunder for
any Losses for breaches of representations and warranties hereunder shall be net
of (a) any insurance  proceeds  received by an  Indemnified  Party or any of its
Affiliates  with  respect  to such Loss  (except to the  extent  such  insurance
proceeds  must be  repaid  by the  Indemnified  Party or its  Affiliates  to the
insurer through  adjustments to past,  present or future  insurance  premiums or
other similar  mechanisms),  and (b) any Tax benefit received by the Indemnified
Party or any of its  Affiliates  with respect to such Losses  (determined  after
taking  into  account  the  Tax  consequences  of  any  related  indemnification
payment).

     (e) The Parties agree that any payment made pursuant to Article VIII or the
indemnification  provisions  of Article VII are intended to be an  adjustment to
the Purchase Price.

Section 8.5.         Remedies Exclusive


     THE PARTIES  ACKNOWLEDGE  AND AGREE THAT THE  REMEDIES SET FORTH IN ARTICLE
VII AND THIS ARTICLE VIII, INCLUDING THE BASKET AMOUNT,  LIABILITY CAP, SURVIVAL
PERIODS,  DISCLAIMERS AND LIMITATIONS ON SUCH REMEDIES,  ARE INTENDED TO BE, AND
SHALL BE, THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDIES UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.

Section 8.6.         Certain Damages


     NEITHER PARTY NOR ANY OF THEIR  RESPECTIVE  AFFILIATES  OR  REPRESENTATIVES
SHALL  BE  LIABLE  TO  THE  OTHER  PARTY  OR  TO  ANY  OF  ITS   AFFILIATES   OR
REPRESENTATIVES  FOR  PUNITIVE  OR  EXEMPLARY  DAMAGES  (OTHER  THAN THIRD PARTY
PUNITIVE  OR  EXEMPLARY  DAMAGES)  IN  CONNECTION  WITH THIS  AGREEMENT  AND THE
TRANSACTIONS  CONTEMPLATED HEREBY,  REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH DAMAGES ARE BASED
ON CONTRACT,  TORT,  STRICT  LIABILITY,  VIOLATION OF LAW, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL OR
EQUITABLE PRINCIPLE.

notwithstanding the participation of any Party in the Closing.

generally or in a particular instance and either retroactively or prospectively)
by the Party  entitled to enforce such term,  but such waiver shall be effective
only if it is in a writing signed by the Party entitled to enforce such term and
against which such waiver is to be asserted. Unless otherwise expressly provided
in this  Agreement,  no delay or omission on the part of any Party in exercising
any right or privilege  under this Agreement  shall operate as a waiver thereof,
nor shall any  waiver on the part of any Party of any right or  privilege  under
this  Agreement  operate as a waiver of any other right or privilege  under this
Agreement,  nor shall any single or partial  exercise of any right or  privilege
preclude  any other or further  exercise  thereof or the  exercise  of any other
right or privilege under this Agreement.

     This Agreement  shall be binding upon and shall inure solely to the benefit
of the  Parties  and their  respective  successors,  legal  representatives  and
permitted  assigns.  Neither  this  Agreement  nor  any  rights  or  obligations
hereunder may be assigned  without the written  consent of the other Party,  and
any  purported  assignment  made  without such  written  consent  shall be void;
provided,  however,  that Buyer may assign its rights and obligations  hereunder

the  transfer of the  Partnership  Interests  and/or  interests  in ALNG to such
Affiliate and (b) to one or more lending  institutions or trustees in connection

shall the assignment by any Party of its respective  rights or obligations under

Section 9.5.         Severability


     If any provision of this Agreement or the application of any such provision
to any  Person or  circumstance  shall be  declared  judicially  to be  invalid,
unenforceable,  or void, such decision shall not have the effect of invalidating
or voiding the remainder of this Agreement, it being the intent and agreement of
the  Parties  that this  Agreement  shall be deemed  amended by  modifying  such
provision  to the extent  necessary  to render it valid,  legal and  enforceable
while  preserving  its  intent  or, if such  modification  is not  possible,  by
substituting  therefor another  provision that is valid,  legal, and enforceable
and that achieves the same objective.

Section 9.6.         Entire Agreement


     This  Agreement  (including  the  Schedules  hereto and the  documents  and
instruments  executed and  delivered in  connection  herewith)  constitutes  the
entire  agreement  between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof
and supersedes  all prior and  contemporaneous  agreements  and  understandings,
whether written or oral,  between the Parties with respect to the subject matter
hereof, and there are no representations,  understandings or agreements relating
to the subject matter hereof that are not fully  expressed in this Agreement and
the documents and instruments executed and delivered in connection herewith. All
Schedules  attached  to  this  Agreement  are  expressly  made  a part  of,  and
incorporated  by  reference  into,  this  Agreement.  If and to the  extent  any
information  required to be  furnished in any Schedule is contained in any other
Schedule attached hereto, such information shall be deemed to be included in all
Schedules in which the information is required to be included to the extent such
disclosure  is reasonably  apparent on its face and provided such  disclosure is
reasonably related to the Schedule in which it is included.

Section 9.7.         Governing Law


     THIS  AGREEMENT  SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE  WITH THE
LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE, WITHOUT REGARD TO SUCH JURISDICTION'S CONFLICT OF
LAWS PROVISIONS. THE PARTIES AGREE THAT VENUE OR ANY SUIT, ACTION, PROCEEDING OR
LITIGATION  ARISING OUT OF OR IN RELATION TO THIS AGREEMENT  SHALL BE IN FEDERAL

     Except as otherwise provided herein, each of the Parties shall bear its own

preparation,   negotiation,   execution,   delivery,  and  performance  of  this
Agreement,  each of the other documents and  instruments  executed in connection
with or contemplated by this Agreement and the  consummation of the transactions

Section 9.9.         Release of Information


     The  Parties  shall  cooperate  with each  other in  releasing  information
concerning this Agreement and the  transactions  contemplated  hereby.  No press

by this Agreement  shall be made by any Party without prior  consultation  with,
and agreement of, the other Party, except for any legally required communication

Section 9.10.        Specific Performance


     Each of the Parties hereto  acknowledges  and agrees that the other Parties
hereto would be  irreparably  damaged in the event any of the provisions of this
Agreement  were not performed in accordance  with their  specific  terms or were
otherwise  breached.  Accordingly,  each of the Parties  hereto  agrees that, in
addition  to any other  remedy to which such Party may be  entitled at Law or in
equity,  they each shall be entitled to an injunction or  injunctions to prevent
breaches of the  provisions of this Agreement and to enforce  specifically  this
Agreement and the terms and provisions hereof.

Section 9.11.        Confidentiality


     Seller  agrees on behalf of itself and its  Affiliates  that,  at all times
from and after the Closing  Date,  it shall keep secret and retain in  strictest
confidence,  and shall not use for its  benefit  or for the  benefit  of others,
confidential   information   with   respect  to  ALNG,   including   Proprietary
Information,  customer lists, details of client or consultant contracts, pricing
policies,   operational   methods,   marketing  plans  or  strategies,   product
development  techniques  or plans,  other than any of the  foregoing  are in the
public  domain  (except  such  materials  that enter the public  domain  through
conduct of Seller or its  Affiliates  which  violates this Section 9.11 prior to
any disclosure by Buyer), and provided that the foregoing shall not restrict any
disclosure of information that,  pursuant to the advice of counsel,  is required
by Law,  legal  process,  or stock  exchange  regulation  and is  implemented in
accordance  with the  following  provisions  of this Section  9.11. In the event
Seller or any of its  Affiliates  receives a request or  becomes  compelled  (by
deposition,  interrogatory, request for documents, subpoena, civil investigative
demand,  order  or  similar  process)  to  disclose  any  of  such  confidential
information,  Seller  agrees to cause the  following  to occur prior to any such
disclosure:

     (a) provide Buyer with prompt written notice of such  requirements  so that
Buyer may seek a  protective  order or other  appropriate  remedy  and/or  waive
compliance with the terms of this Section;

     (b) consult  with Buyer on the  advisability  of taking  steps to resist or
narrow such request; and


                                       45
<PAGE>

     (c) cooperate  with Buyer in any attempt it may make to obtain a protective
order or other appropriate remedy or assurance that confidential  treatment will
be afforded such information.


     In the event such  protective  order or other  remedy is not  obtained,  or
Buyer waives compliance with the provisions hereof, Seller agrees to cause to be
furnished only that portion of such confidential information which Seller or its
Affiliates is advised by written opinion of counsel that it is legally  required
to  furnish,  and to  exercise  reasonable  efforts  to  obtain  assurance  that
confidential treatment will be accorded such information.

Section 9.12.        Certain Construction Rules


     The article and section  headings  and the table of contents  contained  in
this Agreement are for convenience of reference only and shall in no way define,
limit,  extend,  or  describe  the  scope or intent  of any  provisions  of this
Agreement.  Whenever the context may require, any pronoun used in this Agreement
shall include the  corresponding  masculine,  feminine or neuter forms,  and the
singular  form of nouns,  pronouns,  and verbs shall include the plural and vice
versa. In addition, as used in this Agreement,  unless otherwise provided to the
contrary, (a) all references to days, months or years shall be deemed references
to  calendar  days,  months  or years,  and (b) any  reference  to a  "Section,"
"Article,"  or  "Schedule"  shall be deemed to refer to a section  or article of
this Agreement or a schedule  attached to this  Agreement.  The words  "hereof,"
"herein,"  "hereunder,"  and words of similar import referring to this Agreement
refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any  particular  provision of this
Agreement.  Unless  otherwise  specifically  provided for herein,  the term "or"
shall not be deemed to be exclusive.  The term "including" shall mean "including
without limitation."

Section 9.13.        Counterparts


     This  Agreement  may be executed in  multiple  counterparts,  each of which
shall be deemed an original and all of which taken together shall constitute one
instrument  binding on both Parties,  notwithstanding  that both Parties are not
signatories to the original or the same counterpart.

Section 9.14.        Further Assurances


     Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at any time, or from
time to time,  after the  Closing,  at any Party's  request and without  further
consideration,  the other  Parties  shall execute and deliver to such Party such
other instruments of sale,  transfer,  conveyance,  assignment and confirmation,
provide such materials and information and take such other actions as such Party
