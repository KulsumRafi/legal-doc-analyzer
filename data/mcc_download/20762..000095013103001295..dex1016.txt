to the terms and conditions herein, amounts borrowed under this Agreement will
be in the form of revolving loans which may be repaid and reborrowed from time

Section 2.04. Any Agent Advance so made by the Administrative Agent shall

by the Company no later than the fifteenth (15th) day after the earliest date on
which any condition precedent to the making of a Loan set forth in Section 5.05
shall fail to be satisfied. Agent Advances may be made only in the following
circumstances:

               (i)  For administrative convenience and subject to Section 2.01,
     the Administrative Agent may, but is not obligated to, make Agent Advances
     in reliance upon the Company's actual or deemed representations under
     Section 5.05 that the conditions for borrowing are satisfied;

               (ii) If the conditions for borrowing under Section 5.05 cannot be
     fulfilled, the Company shall in its Notice of Borrowing or otherwise give
     immediate notice thereof to the Administrative Agent and the Tranche 2
     Banks, and the Administrative Agent may, but is not obligated to, continue
     to make Agent Advances during the thirteen-day period beginning two (2)
     Business Days after receipt of such notice by the Administrative Agent, if
     the Company shall at such time be in compliance with the limitations set
     forth in Section 2.01; provided, however, that the Majority Banks may
     sooner instruct the Administrative Agent to cease making such Agent
     Advances at any time.

receives to the repayment of the outstanding Agent Advances (beginning with the
oldest Agent Advance), prior to repayment of any other Loans, notwithstanding
any provision contained in any Loan Document or any direction of the Company or
any other Person to the contrary.

     such drawing.

          whether the conditions for the requested Borrowing are satisfied and
          whether the requested Borrowing is of Prime Rate Loans or Eurodollar
          Rate Loans. The Company may request one or more Borrowings on the same
          Business Day. Each such Borrowing shall, unless otherwise specifically
          provided herein, consist entirely of Loans of the same Type and, if
          such Borrowing is to consist of Eurodollar Rate Loans, shall be in an
          aggregate amount for all Tranche 2 Banks of not less than $5,000,000

          Advance or Agent Advance, in which case the Administrative Agent may
          in its discretion waive such minimums. The right of the Company to

          4.07.

                    (C) On or prior to the Effective Date, the Company shall
          have provided to the Administrative Agent a list, with specimen

          Issuance of Letters of Credit, substantially in the form attached to
          this Agreement as Exhibit A-2, and the amendments thereof. The

          replaced by the Company. The Administrative Agent shall have no duty
          to verify the authenticity of the signature appearing on any Notice of
          Borrowing or other writing delivered hereunder and, with respect to an
          oral request for Loans, the Administrative Agent shall have no duty to
          verify the identity of any individual representing himself as one of
          the officers authorized to make such request on behalf of the Company.
          Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of the Tranche 2 Banks shall
          incur any liability to the Company as a result of acting upon any
          telephonic notice the Administrative Agent believes in good faith to
          have been given by a duly authorized officer or other individual
          authorized to request Loans on behalf of the Company or for otherwise
          acting in good faith with respect to any such request for Loans.

immediately preceding sentences, shall pay the Administrative Agent interest on
such amount for each day from the date it was made available by the
Administrative Agent to the Company to the date it is recovered by the
Administrative Agent at a rate per annum equal to (x) the overnight Federal
Funds Rate, if paid by the Defaulting Bank, or (y) the then applicable rate of
interest calculated under Section 4.01, if paid by the Company. Nothing herein
shall be deemed to relieve any Tranche 2 Bank from its obligation to fulfill its
commitments hereunder or to prejudice any rights which the Company may have
against any Tranche 2 Bank as a result of any default by such Tranche 2 Bank
hereunder, including, without limitation, the right of the Company to seek
reimbursement from any Defaulting Bank for any amounts paid by the Company under
clause (y) above on account of such Defaulting Bank's default.

          (b) The failure of any Tranche 2 Bank to fund its Pro Rata Share of
any Loan (including Agent Advances) shall not relieve any other Tranche 2 Bank
of its obligation to fund its Pro Rata Share of such Loan. Conversely, no
Tranche 2 Bank shall be responsible for the failure of another Tranche 2 Bank to
fund its Pro Rata Share of a Loan.

          (c) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, so long
as any Tranche 2 Bank shall be in default in its obligation to fund its Pro Rata
Share of any Loan or shall have rejected its Commitment, then such Tranche 2
Bank shall not be entitled to receive any payments of principal of or interest
on the Loans or its share of any Commitment or other fees payable hereunder, and
for purposes of voting or consenting to matters with respect to the Loan
Documents, such Tranche 2 Bank shall be deemed not to be a "Bank" or "Tranche 2
Bank" hereunder, the combined Commitments of all the Banks and the combined
Commitments of the Tranche 2 Banks then in effect shall be reduced by an amount
equal to such Tranche 2 Bank's Commitment and such Tranche 2 Bank's Commitment
shall be deemed to be zero (0), unless and until (x) (i) the Loans and all
interest thereon and all fees and other amounts owing under the

                                       40

<PAGE>

Loan Documents (other than amounts owing to such Tranche 2 Bank) have been paid
in full in cash and (ii) the L/C Obligations shall have been repaid in full in
cash and/or collateralized in full in cash in such manner and order as shall be
determined by the Administrative Agent, (y) such failure to fulfill its
obligation to fund is cured and such Tranche 2 Bank shall have paid, as and to
the extent provided in this Section 2.05, to the applicable party, if any,
interest on the amount of funds that such Tranche 2 Bank failed to timely fund
or (z) in respect of receiving payments but not in respect of voting or
consenting, the Obligations under this Agreement shall have been declared or
shall have become immediately due and payable. No Commitment of any Bank shall
be increased or otherwise affected by any such failure or rejection by any
Tranche 2 Bank. Any payments of principal or interest which would, but for this
paragraph, be paid to any Tranche 2 Bank, and which shall have been reimbursed
by the Company to the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 2.05(a), shall be
paid to the Tranche 2 Banks who shall not be in default under their respective
Commitments and who shall not have rejected any Commitment and to the Tranche 1
Banks to the extent of any participation in Loans purchased by them pursuant to
Section 3.03(b), for application to the Loans or to provide cash collateral in
such manner and order as shall be determined by the Administrative Agent.

          2.06 Mandatory Payment; Reduction of Commitments.

          (a) In the event that (i) the Effective Amount of all Loans then
outstanding exceeds the lesser of (x) $200,000,000 and (y) the combined
Commitments then in effect or (ii) the Effective Amount of all Loans then
outstanding plus the Effective Amount of all L/C Obligations plus the Effective
Amount of all Outstanding Eligible LOIs exceeds the lesser of (x) the combined
Commitments then in effect and (y) the Borrowing Base, then the Loans (subject
to the third sentence of Section 2.06(c)) shall be immediately due and payable
in the amount of such excess without the necessity of any demand, provided that
if there shall be no Loans then outstanding, the Company shall Cash
Collateralize outstanding Letters of Credit and Outstanding Eligible LOIs as
provided in Section 2.06(d) in an amount equal to such excess.

          (b) On or before the fifth Business Day following the date of receipt
thereof by the Company and/or any Restricted Subsidiary of the cash proceeds to
the extent generated by trade payables terms from any sale of Petroleum
Inventory that was purchased with the proceeds of Loans made in accordance with
the second sentence of Section 7.11, an amount equal to such cash proceeds shall
be applied as a mandatory repayment of principal of the then outstanding Loans;
provided that the Company shall ratably repay all Loans made in accordance with
the second sentence of Section 7.11 not later than the 90th day after such Loan
was made, in each case without any reduction in Commitments.

          (c) On the Facility Expiry Date, the Commitment of each Bank shall be
automatically reduced to zero and may not be reinstated. The Company may reduce
or terminate either the Tranche 1 Commitments or the Tranche 2 Commitments, or a
combination thereof, at any time and from time to time in whole or in part upon
at least five (5) Business Days' notice to the Administrative Agent (a
"Voluntary Reduction"). Each such Voluntary Reduction must be in an amount not
less than $5,000,000 (and in increments of $1,000,000 in excess thereof),
provided, that the amount of each such Voluntary Reduction may not (x) reduce
the combined Commitments to an amount less than the sum of (i) the Effective
Amount of the Loans plus (ii) the Effective Amount of all L/C Obligations plus
(iii) the Effective Amount of all Outstanding

                                       41

<PAGE>

Eligible LOIs less, in the case of a Voluntary Reduction of the combined
Commitments to zero, the amount of Letters of Credit and Outstanding Eligible
LOIs which are Cash Collateralized in accordance with Section 2.06(d), (y)
reduce the combined Commitments of the Tranche 2 Banks to an amount less than
the Effective Amount of the Loans or (z) reduce the combined Tranche 1
Commitments of the Tranche 1 Banks to an amount less than the amount withdrawn
from the Tranche 1 Credit-Linked Deposit Account to reimburse Issuing Banks for
drawn Letters of Credit which have not been reimbursed by the Company. Once
reduced, no portion of the Commitments may be reinstated. In the event the
Tranche 1 Commitments shall be reduced as provided in this clause (c), the
Administrative Agent will return all amounts in the Tranche 1 Credit-Linked
Deposit Account in excess of the reduced Tranche 1 Commitments to the Tranche 1
Banks ratably in accordance with their Tranche 1 Percentage Interest.

          (d) If any Letter of Credit is outstanding or there exists any
Outstanding Eligible LOIs upon (i) the termination of the combined Commitments,
or (ii) if at any time there shall be any Loans, interest thereon or commitment
fees, Standby Letter of Credit fees, or Commercial Letter of Credit fees
outstanding and unpaid and the L/C Obligations shall be greater than the lesser
of (x) the Borrowing Base and (y) the combined Commitments, the Company shall
deposit with the Administrative Agent, for the ratable benefit of the Banks,
Cash and/or, with respect to clause (i) above only, with the approval of the
Administrative Agent in its sole discretion, standby letters of credit (other
than Standby Letters of Credit) issued in favor of the Administrative Agent for
the benefit of the Banks by a financially sound financial institution reasonably
acceptable to the Administrative Agent, in the amount of all such Letters of
Credit outstanding and Outstanding Eligible LOIs upon such termination or the
amount of such excess L/C Obligations and Outstanding Eligible LOIs, as the case
may be, which Cash shall be held as collateral in an interest bearing account on
terms satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.

          2.07 Maintenance of Loan Account; Statements of Account. The
Administrative Agent shall maintain an account on its books in the name of the
Company (the "Loan Account") in which the Company will be charged with all loans
and advances made by the Banks to the Company or for the Company's account,
including the Loans and all L/C Obligations, the Fees, the Expenses and any
other Obligations. The Loan Account will be credited with all amounts received
by the Administrative Agent from the Company or from others for the Company's
account, on the date received provided such amounts are received by no later
than 3:00 p.m. (New York City time), and on the next Business Day if received
after such time. In no event shall prior recourse to any Collateral be a
prerequisite to the Administrative Agent's right to demand payment of any
Obligation upon its maturity. After the end of each month, the Administrative
Agent shall send the Company a statement accounting for the charges, loans,
advances and other transactions occurring among and between the Administrative
Agent, the Banks and the Company during that month. The monthly statements
shall, absent manifest error, be an account statement, which is final,
conclusive and binding on the Company; provided, however, that in respect of
Expenses that are, by the express terms of this Agreement required to be
reasonable, the Company reserves the right to assert that unreasonable Expenses
should not be so reimbursed.

          2.08 Payment Procedures. Payments of interest, Fees and Expenses shall
be made not later than 2:00 p.m. (New York City time), on the day when due, in
immediately available Dollars, to the Administrative Agent at its address
provided pursuant to Section 11.02

                                       42

<PAGE>

of this Agreement. The Company hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to
charge the Loan Account or any other deposit account of the Company with the
Administrative Agent with the amount of all payments to be made hereunder and
under the other Loan Documents, including all Fees and Expenses, as and when
such payments become due. The Company's obligations to the Banks with respect to
such payments shall be discharged by making such payments to the Administrative
Agent pursuant to this Section or by charging the Loan Account or such other
deposit account. The Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the Banks (after
its receipt thereof) any amounts received by it from the Company for the account
of the Banks.

          2.09 Cash Management System. The Company shall during the term of this
Agreement maintain the existing cash management system including its network of
Lockbox, Collection Deposit Account and Concentration Account pursuant to the
Collection Bank Agreement and the Concentration Bank Agreement.

          2.10 Application of Payments. All amounts received shall be credited
to the Loan Account for application to the Obligations in the following order:
first, to the payment of any Fees, Expenses or other Obligations due and payable
to the Collateral Agent and the Administrative Agent under any of the Loan
Documents, excluding Agent Advances; second, to the payment of interest due on
any Agent Advances and other amounts which have not been reimbursed to the
Administrative Agent by the Tranche 2 Banks; third, to the payment of principal
of Agent Advances; fourth, to the payment of any Fees, expenses or other
Obligations due and payable to the Issuing Banks under any of the Loan
Documents; fifth, to the ratable payment of any Fees, expenses or other
Obligations due and payable to the Banks under any of the Loan Documents other
than those Obligations specifically referred to in this Section 2.10; sixth, to
the ratable payment of interest due on the Loans; seventh, to the ratable
payment of principal due on the Loans; and eighth, to the Cash Collateralization
of outstanding Letters of Credit and Outstanding Eligible LOIs in such manner
and order as shall be determined by the Administrative Agent. Any payment
received hereunder as a distribution in any proceeding referred to in Section
9.01(f) or (g) shall, unless paid with respect to amounts specifically owing to
the Administrative Agent or any Issuing Bank, be distributed and applied to the
payment of the amounts due hereunder and under the Notes ratably in accordance
with such amounts (or, if a court of competent jurisdiction shall otherwise
specify, as specified by such court).

          2.11 Increase of Commitments. So long as no Default or Event of
Default then exists or would result therefrom, the Company may, at any time and
from time to time and upon at least five (5) Business Days' notice, deliver a
written request to the Administrative Agent to increase the aggregate
Commitments under this Agreement by up to $50,000,000 in the aggregate
("Commitment Increase Amount"). Each such request to increase the Commitments
shall be a Commitment Increase Amount of not less than $5,000,000 or in an
integral multiple of $5,000,000 in excess thereof. The Commitment Increase
Amount will be in the form of increases in the Commitments under the Tranche 2
Facility. In the event the Company desires to increase the Commitments, the
Administrative Agent, upon receipt of the written request from the Company
described above, may offer to (x) any Bank or (y) one or more banks, financial
institutions or other entities, which are not Banks and are acceptable to the
Administrative Agent in its sole discretion ("New Banks"), the opportunity to
participate in any or all of the Commitment Increase Amount. No existing Bank
shall be required to increase its Commitment under this Agreement as a result of
the Company's request for a Commitment Increase Amount

                                       43

<PAGE>

and each such Bank's Commitment may only be increased by an instrument duly
executed by such Bank agreeing to increase its Commitment. Any such increase
shall become effective upon the execution by the Company, the Administrative
Agent and any lender providing a portion of the Commitment Increase Amount of an
assumption agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
Administrative Agent and the Company, pursuant to which, if such lender is a New
Bank, such New Bank shall become a Bank under this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents with respect to its portion of the Commitment Increase Amount. Upon
the effectiveness of a Commitment Increase Amount, each Bank's Pro Rata Share in
the liability of each outstanding Letter of Credit shall be reallocated in
accordance with the definition of "Pro Rata Share" (with written notice of such
reallocation to be promptly delivered to all the Banks) and if there are any
outstanding Loans, the Banks and/ or such New Bank providing the Commitment
Increase Amount shall make such payments among themselves as directed by the
Administrative Agent so that the aggregate principal amount of Loans outstanding
shall be owed to the Banks based on each such Bank's Pro Rata Share of such
Loans. In addition, interest payments and Letter of Credit fees to the Banks
shall be reflective of such reallocated Loans and Letter of Credit liabilities
as directed by the Administrative Agent. This Agreement and the other Loan
Documents shall be deemed to be amended to reflect the Commitment Increase
Amount and the addition of any New Banks as Banks party hereto and thereto.

                                  ARTICLE III.

                                LETTERS OF CREDIT

          3.01 Issuance of Letters of Credit. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and in reliance upon the representations and
warranties of the Company set forth herein, each Issuing Bank shall issue or
cause one of its Affiliates (including, without limitation, Deutsche Bank AG,
New York Branch) to issue in its own name Letters of Credit hereunder at the
request of the Company and for its account (which can support obligations of the
Company or Subsidiaries of the Company), as more specifically described below.
No Issuing Bank shall, in the case of clauses (a) and (b) be permitted to, and
in the case of clauses (c) and (d) be obligated to, issue any Letter of Credit
for the account of the Company (which can support obligations of the Company or
Subsidiaries of the Company) if at the time of such requested Issuance:

          (a) the Effective Amount of all L/C Obligations plus the Effective
Amount of all Outstanding Eligible LOIs plus the Effective Amount of all Loans
exceeds the lesser of the combined Commitments then in effect and the Borrowing
Base then in effect, or the participation (after giving effect to the provisions
of Section 3.03(b) hereof as if a Trigger Event has occurred and is continuing)
of any Bank in the Effective Amount of all L/C Obligations plus the Effective
Amount of the Loans of such Bank exceeds such Bank's Commitment;

          (b) the aggregate face amount of all Standby Letters of Credit issued
for any purpose other than for the purchase of Petroleum Inventory is at any
time in excess of $100,000,000;

                                       44

<PAGE>

          (c) Any order, judgment or decree of any Governmental Authority or
arbitrator shall purport by its terms to enjoin or restrain such Issuing Bank
from issuing such Letter of Credit or any Requirements of Law applicable to such
Issuing Bank or any request or directive (whether or not having the force of
law) from any Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over such Issuing Bank
shall prohibit, or request that the Issuing Bank refrain from, the issuance of
letters of credit generally or such Letter of Credit in particular or shall
impose upon such Issuing Bank with respect to such Letter of Credit any
restriction or reserve or capital requirement (for which such Issuing Bank is
not otherwise compensated) not in effect as of the Effective Date, or any
unreimbursed loss, cost or expense which was not applicable, in effect or known
to such Issuing Bank as of the Effective Date and which such Issuing Bank deems
in good faith to be material to it; or

          (d) A default of any Bank's obligations to fund under Section 3.05
exists, or such Bank is a Defaulting Bank under Section 2.05, unless such
Issuing Bank has entered into satisfactory arrangements with the Company to
eliminate such Issuing Bank's risk with respect to such Bank, including Cash
Collateralization of such Bank's Pro Rata Share of the L/C Obligations in such
manner and order as the Administrative Agent shall determine.

          3.02 Terms of Letters of Credit; Existing Letters of Credit.

          (a) The Letters of Credit shall be in a form customarily Issued by the
Issuing Bank or in such other form as has been approved by such Issuing Bank and
shall be payable only (i) in U.S. Dollars and (ii) upon presentation of a demand
by the beneficiary thereof accompanied by the required documentation in
compliance with the terms and conditions of each such Letter of Credit. At the
time of Issuance the terms and conditions of each Letter of Credit shall be
subject to approval by the Issuing Bank and the Company. In no event may the
term of (i) any Standby Letter of Credit issued hereunder to purchase Inventory
exceed 120 days (except that such Letters of Credit may provide for automatic
renewal), (ii) any other Standby Letter of Credit exceed one year (except that
such Letters of Credit may provide for automatic extensions for periods of up to
one year) or (iii) the term of any Commercial Letter of Credit exceed 90 days,
and all Letters of Credit issued hereunder shall expire no later than the date
that is ten (10) calendar days prior to the Facility Expiry Date. Any Letter of
Credit containing an automatic renewal provision shall also contain a provision
pursuant to which, notwithstanding any other provisions thereof, it shall expire
no later than the date that is fifteen (15) calendar days prior to the Facility
Expiry Date, and a provision pursuant to which the Issuing Bank may, by notice
to the beneficiary of such Letter of Credit at least thirty days (30) prior to
the expiration of its term, elect not to renew such Letter of Credit for an
additional term.

          (b) All outstanding letters of credit issued under the Existing Credit
Agreement and set forth on Schedule 3.02 shall be deemed issued hereunder and
shall be, for all purposes, Letters of Credit hereunder.

          3.03 Banks' Participation.

          (a) Subject to Section 3.03(b) below, immediately upon and following
the Issuance or amendment by the Issuing Bank of any Letter of Credit in
accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 3.01, each Bank shall be
deemed to have irrevocably and

                                       45

<PAGE>

unconditionally purchased and received from the Issuing Bank, without recourse
or warranty, an undivided interest and participation to the extent of such
Bank's Pro Rata Share in the liability with respect to such Letter of Credit
(including, without limitation, all obligations of the Company with respect
thereto, other than amounts owing to the Issuing Bank consisting of Issuing Bank
Fees) and any security therefor or guaranty pertaining thereto.

          (b) Upon the occurrence of and during the continuation of a Trigger
Event and notwithstanding the provisions of Section 3.03(a) above, if any Loans
are outstanding, (x) each Tranche 1 Bank shall be deemed to have irrevocably
(until such Trigger Event is cured or waived) and unconditionally purchased (at
par) and received, without recourse or warranty, an undivided interest and
participation in the liability with respect to all Loans (including, without
limitation, all obligations of the Company with respect thereto) and any
security therefor or guaranty pertaining thereto to the extent required for each
Tranche 1 Bank to have its Pro Rata Share of such Loans and (y) each Bank's Pro
Rata Share of each outstanding Letter of Credit shall be reallocated in
accordance with the definition of "Pro Rata Share." If there are any outstanding
Loans, the Administrative Agent shall withdraw from the Tranche 1 Credit-Linked
Deposit Account such amounts as are necessary in accordance with this subsection
3.03(b) for ratable distribution to the Tranche 2 Banks. If there are any
outstanding unreimbursed Letters of Credit, the Tranche 2 Banks shall pay to the
Administrative Agent such amounts as are necessary in accordance with this
subsection 3.03(b) for deposit in the Tranche 1 Credit-Linked Deposit Account.
Upon the cure or waiver of all outstanding Trigger Events, the Banks shall sell
back the interest and participation purchased as aforesaid and, if there are any
outstanding Loans, the Tranche 2 Banks shall repay to the Administrative Agent
for deposit in the Tranche 1 Credit-Linked Deposit Account all such amounts as
are necessary to reflect the applicable Pro Rata Shares in the absence of a
Trigger Event.

          3.04 Notice of Issuance.

          (a) Whenever the Company desires the Issuance of a Letter of Credit,
the Company shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an L/C Request, in the
form attached to this Agreement as Exhibit A-2, not later than 2:00 p.m. (New
York City time), at least one (1) Business Day (or such shorter period as may be
agreed to by the Administrative Agent) in advance of the proposed date of
Issuance. Upon receipt of an L/C Request, the Administrative Agent shall pass on
the request to the Issuing Bank indicating its approval to issue the requested
Letter of Credit by adding its signature to the L/C Request. If required to do
so by the Issuing Bank, the Company shall provide the Issuing Bank with such
Issuing Bank's letter of credit application. The transmittal by the Company of
each L/C Request shall be deemed to be a representation and warranty by the
Company that the Letter of Credit may be Issued in accordance with and will not
violate any of the requirements of Section 3.01. Prior to the Issuance of each
Letter of Credit, the Company shall provide to the applicable Issuing Bank a
precise description of the documents and the text of any certificate to be
presented by the beneficiary of such Letter of Credit which, if presented by
such beneficiary on or prior to the expiration date of the Letter of Credit,
would require such Issuing Bank to make payment under the Letter of Credit. The
Issuing Bank, in its reasonable judgment, may require changes in any such
documents and certificates. No Commercial Letter of Credit shall require payment
against a conforming document to be made thereunder prior to the second Business
Day (under the laws of the jurisdiction of the Issuing Bank) after the date on
which such document is presented,

                                       46

<PAGE>

together with all documents and/or certificates required to be presented in
connection therewith under the terms of the applicable Letter of Credit. A L/C
Request and/or letter of credit application may be given in writing or
electronically and, if requested by the Administrative Agent or the applicable
Issuing Bank, with prompt confirmation in writing. Any electronic L/C Request or
letter of credit application shall be deemed to have been prepared by, or under
the supervision of a Responsible Officer of the Company. In the event of any
conflict between the terms and conditions of any letter of credit application
and this Agreement, the terms and conditions of this Agreement will govern.

          (b) When the Administrative Agent is not the Issuing Bank for all
Letters of Credit, then the other Issuing Banks are to send to the
Administrative Agent no later than 12:00 noon on each business day, by facsimile
transmission, their daily aggregate stated amount of Standby and Commercial
Letters of Credit balances for the previous day. With regard to Standby Letters
of Credit, in addition to the daily report, the other Issuing Banks shall
promptly, after the Issuance of or amendment to any Standby Letter of Credit,
deliver to the Administrative Agent copies of any such issuance or amendment.
The Administrative Agent shall, upon receiving reports from other Issuing Banks
regarding Standby Letters of Credit, notify each Bank of the daily aggregate
outstandings for Standby Letters of Credit. The Agent shall deliver to each Bank
upon each calendar month end and concurrently with each Letter of Credit fee
payment a report setting forth for such period the daily aggregate stated amount
available to be drawn under Standby and Commercial Letters of Credit issued by
all Issuing Banks during such period.

          3.05 Payment of Amounts Drawn Under Letters of Credit. In the event of
any drawing under any Letter of Credit by the beneficiary thereof, the
applicable Issuing Bank shall notify the Administrative Agent, which shall
notify the Company of such draw, not later than 11:00 a.m. (New York City time),
on the day on which the Issuing Bank intends to honor such drawing. Unless the
Company shall, at the time of such drawing, have posted funds with such Issuing
Bank sufficient to reimburse such drawing in full in Cash, the Administrative
Agent shall reimburse the applicable Issuing Bank for the amount of such drawing
from funds held in the Tranche 1 Credit-Linked Deposit Account to the extent of
the Tranche 1 Banks' Pro Rata Share of the exposure with respect to such Letter
of Credit. In the event funds from the Tranche 1 Credit-Linked Deposit Account
are withdrawn by the Administrative Agent to reimburse the applicable Issuing
Bank for an unreimbursed drawing, the Company shall have the right, at any time
prior to the Facility Expiry Date, to pay over to the Administrative Agent in
reimbursement thereof an amount equal to the amount so withdrawn for deposit in
the Tranche 1 Credit-Linked Deposit Account. In the event that any reimbursement
shall be due to an Issuing Bank under the preceding provisions of this Section
on a day other than the last day of an Interest Period in effect for the Tranche
1 Credit-Linked Deposits, the Administrative Agent shall have the right, but not
the obligation, to advance its own funds to cover the amount due to such Issuing
Bank, in which case (i) title to an amount of each Tranche 1 Bank's Tranche 1
Credit-Linked Deposit equal to its Tranche 1 Percentage Interest of the amount
so advanced by the Administrative Agent (together with the interest accruing
thereon) shall automatically be transferred to the Administrative Agent, which
shall reimburse itself for the amount advanced by it through the liquidation of
such amounts from the Tranche 1 Credit-Linked Deposits at the end of the
applicable Interest Period, and (ii) the Company shall pay to the Administrative
Agent, upon the Administrative Agent's request therefor, the amount, if any, by
which the Administrative

                                       47

<PAGE>

Agent's cost of funds for the period from the date of such reimbursement of the
Issuing Bank through the end of the applicable Interest Period, as determined by
the Administrative Agent (such determination to be conclusive absent manifest
error) and set forth in the request for payment delivered to the Company, shall
exceed the interest accrued on a like amount of the Tranche 1 Credit-Linked
Deposits at the Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period. In the event the
Company shall fail to pay any amount due under clause (ii) of the preceding
sentence, the interest payable by the Administrative Agent to the Tranche 1
Banks on their Tranche 1 Credit-Linked Deposits under Section 3.10 shall be
correspondingly reduced and the Tranche 1 Banks shall without further act
succeed, ratably in accordance with their Tranche 1 Percentages, to the rights
of the Administrative Agent with respect to such amount. In the event that funds
in the Tranche 1 Credit-Linked Deposit Account are insufficient to reimburse any
Issuing Bank for any drawing (a "shortfall") the Company will be deemed to have
concurrently with any such drawing, given a Notice of Borrowing to the
Administrative Agent for Prime Rate Loans in the amount equal to such shortfall.
Subject to satisfaction or waiver of the conditions specified in Article V and
the other terms of and conditions to Borrowing contained herein, the Tranche 2
Banks shall be obligated, on the date such drawing is honored, to make Loans in
the amount of such drawing, the proceeds of which shall be applied directly by
the Administrative Agent to reimburse the applicable Issuing Bank for the amount
of such drawing or payment. If for any reason, proceeds of such Loans are not
received by such Issuing Bank on such date in an amount equal to the amount of
such drawing, the Company shall be obligated to and shall reimburse such Issuing
Bank, on the Business Day (under the laws of the jurisdiction of the Issuing
Bank) immediately following the date of such drawing, in an amount in
immediately available funds equal to the excess of the amount of such drawing
over the amount of such Loans, if any, which are so received, plus accrued
interest on such amount at the rate set forth in Section 4.01 of this Agreement.

          If any drawing reimbursement that has been funded from the Tranche 1
Credit-Linked Deposits shall be reimbursed by the Company on a day other than on
the last day of an Interest Period applicable to the Tranche 1 Credit-Linked
Deposits, the Administrative Agent shall invest the amount so reimbursed in
overnight or short-term cash equivalent investments until the end of the
Interest Period at the time in effect and the Company shall pay to the
Administrative Agent, upon the Administrative Agent's request therefor, the
amount, if any, by which the interest accrued on a like amount of the Tranche 1
Credit-Linked Deposits at the Eurodollar Rate for the Interest Period in effect
therefor shall exceed the interest earned through the investment of the amount
so reimbursed for the period from the date of such reimbursement through the end
of the applicable Interest Period, as determined by the Administrative Agent
(such determination to be conclusive absent manifest error) and set forth in the
request for payment delivered to the Company. In the event the Company shall
fail to pay any amount due under this paragraph, the interest payable by the
Administrative Agent to the Tranche 1 Banks on their Tranche 1 Credit-Linked
Deposits under Section 3.10 shall be correspondingly reduced and the Tranche 1
Banks shall without further act succeed, ratably in accordance with their
Tranche 1 Percentage Interest, to the rights of the Administrative Agent with
respect to such amount.

          3.06 Payment by Banks. If Loans are not made in an amount sufficient
to reimburse the applicable Issuing Bank in full for the amount of any draw, the
Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Bank of the unreimbursed amount
of such drawing and of such Bank's respective participation therein. Each Bank
shall make available to the Administrative

                                       48

<PAGE>

Agent for the benefit of the applicable Issuing Bank an amount equal to such
Bank's respective participation in immediately available funds, not later than
1:00 p.m. (New York City time), on the Business Day (under the laws of the
jurisdiction of the Issuing Bank) after the date notified by the Administrative
Agent. In addition, in the event that any Bank fails to make available to the
Administrative Agent the amount of any such Bank's participation in such L/C
Obligation as provided in this Section 3.06, the Administrative Agent may, but
shall not be obligated to, fund the amount of such Defaulting Bank's
participation in such Letter of Credit and recover such amount on demand from
such Defaulting Bank in accordance with Section 2.05 of this Agreement. In the
event that any Bank fails to make available to the Administrative Agent the
amount of such Bank's participation in such Letter of Credit as provided in this
Section 3.06, and the Administrative Agent does not elect to fund to the Issuing
Bank such Defaulting Bank's participation in such Letter of Credit, the Issuing
Bank shall be entitled to recover such amount on demand from such Bank together
with interest at the Federal Funds Rate for the first three Business Days while
such amount remains unpaid and thereafter at the Prime Rate. The Administrative
Agent shall distribute to each other Bank which has paid all amounts payable by
it under this Section 3.06 with respect to any Letter of Credit Issued by the
applicable Issuing Bank such other Bank's Pro Rata Share of all payments
subsequently received by the Administrative Agent from the Company in
reimbursement of drawings honored by the Issuing Bank under such Letter of
Credit when such payments are received.

          3.07 Nature of Issuing Bank's Duties. In determining whether to pay
under any Letter of Credit, the applicable Issuing Bank shall be responsible
only to determine that the documents and certificates required to be delivered
under that Letter of Credit have been delivered and that they comply on their
face with the requirements of that Letter of Credit. As among the Company, any
Issuing Bank and each other Bank, the Company assumes all risks of the acts and
omissions of such Issuing Bank (except to the extent that it is finally
judicially determined that such acts or omissions were the result of such
Issuing Bank's gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a court
of competent jurisdiction) or misuse of the Letters of Credit by the respective
beneficiaries of such Letters of Credit. In furtherance and not in limitation of
the foregoing, neither the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank nor any of the
other Banks shall be responsible (i) for the form, validity, sufficiency,
accuracy, genuineness or legal effects of any document submitted by any party in
connection with the application for and Issuance of or any drawing honored under
such Letters of Credit even if it should in fact prove to be in any or all
respects invalid, insufficient, inaccurate, fraudulent or forged, (ii) for the
validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or
purporting to transfer or assign any such Letter of Credit, or the rights or
benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove to
be invalid or ineffective for any reason, (iii) for failure of the beneficiary
of any such Letter of Credit to strictly comply with conditions required in
order to draw upon such Letter of Credit, (iv) for errors, omissions,
interruptions or delays in transmission or delivery of any messages, by mail,
cable, telegraph, telex, facsimile or otherwise, whether or not they be in
cipher, (v) for errors in interpretation of technical terms, (vi) for any loss
or delay in the transmission or otherwise of any document required in order to
make a drawing under any such Letter of Credit, or of the proceeds thereof,
(vii) for the misapplication by the beneficiary of any such Letter of Credit of
the proceeds of any drawing honored under such Letter of Credit, and (viii) for
any consequences arising from causes beyond the control of such Issuing Bank,
the Administrative Agent or the other Banks. The Issuing Bank shall not be
obligated to and shall not pay against any non-conforming documents presented to
it in connection with any Letters of

                                       49

<PAGE>

Credit without the prior written consent of the Company. None of the above shall
affect, impair, or prevent the vesting of any of the Issuing Bank's rights or
powers hereunder. Any action taken or omitted to be taken by the Issuing Bank
under or in connection with any Letter of Credit, if taken or omitted in the
absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct, shall not create for the
Issuing Bank any liability to the Company, the Administrative Agent or any Bank.

          3.08 Obligations Absolute. The obligations of the Company to reimburse
the Issuing Bank for drawings honored under the Letters of Credit and the
obligations of the Banks under Section 3.06 shall be unconditional and
irrevocable and shall be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement under all circumstances including, without limitation, the following
circumstances:

          (a) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit;

          (b) the existence of any claim, setoff, defense or other right which
the Company or any Affiliate of the Company may have at any time against a
beneficiary or any transferee of any Letter of Credit (or any Persons or
entities for whom any such beneficiary or transferee may be acting), the
applicable Issuing Bank, any Bank or any other Person, whether in connection
with this Agreement, the transactions contemplated herein or any unrelated
transaction;

          (c) any draft, demand, certificate or any other documents presented
under any Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or
insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate
in any respect;

          (d) the surrender or impairment of any security for the performance or
observance of any of the terms of any of the Loan Documents;

          (e) payment by the Issuing Bank under any Letter of Credit against
presentation of a demand, draft or certificate or other document which does not
comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit;

          (f) failure of any drawing under a Letter of Credit or any
nonapplication or misapplication by the beneficiary of the proceeds of any
drawing; or

          (g) the fact that a Default or an Event of Default shall have occurred
and be continuing;

provided, however, that the Company shall have no obligation to reimburse any
Issuing Bank, and the Banks shall have no obligation under Section 3.06, in the
event of such Issuing Bank's willful misconduct or gross negligence in
determining whether documents presented under the Letter of Credit comply with
the terms of such Letter of Credit.

          3.09 Uniform Customs and Practice and Uniform Commercial Code. The
Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits as published by the
International Chamber of Commerce ("UCP") most recently at the time of Issuance
of any Letter of Credit shall (unless otherwise expressly provided in the
Letters of Credit) apply to the Letters of Credit. Without limiting the
foregoing, to the extent not addressed in the UCP, the UCC shall (unless
otherwise expressly provided in the Letters of Credit) apply to the Letters of
Credit.

          3.10 Credit-Linked Deposit Account. (a) On the Effective Date, DB will
be the sole Tranche 1 Bank. DB shall be responsible for all obligations of the
Tranche 1 Banks (including matters related to exposure with respect to, and
rights to receive payments in respect of, Letters of Credit) until it assigns
its Tranche 1 Commitment to various banks and/or other financial institutions,
which it intends (in its sole discretion) to do promptly following the Effective
Date. Each such assignee of DB shall pay to the Administrative Agent its Tranche
1 Credit-Linked Deposit on the date such assignee becomes a Tranche 1 Bank. The
Tranche 1 Credit-Linked Deposits shall be held by the Administrative Agent in
the Tranche 1 Credit-Linked Deposit Account, and no party other than the
Administrative Agent shall have a right of withdrawal from the Tranche 1
Credit-Linked Deposit Account or any other right or power with respect to the
Tranche 1 Credit-Linked Deposits. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, the funding obligation of each Tranche 1 Bank in respect of its
participation in Letters of Credit or otherwise as provided in this Agreement
shall be satisfied in full upon the funding of its Tranche 1 Credit-Linked
Deposit.

          (b) Each of the Administrative Agent, each Issuing Bank issuing any
Letter of Credit and each Tranche 1 Bank hereby acknowledges and agrees that
each Tranche 1 Bank is funding its Tranche 1 Credit-Linked Deposit to the
Administrative Agent for application in the manner contemplated by Section 3.05
(and if required by Section 3.03) and that the Administrative Agent has agreed
to invest the Tranche 1 Credit-Linked Deposits so as to earn a return (except
during periods when (i) such Tranche 1 Credit-Linked Deposits, or funds advanced
by the Administrative Agent against such Tranche 1 Credit-Linked Deposits, are
used to reimburse an Issuing Bank with respect to unreimbursed draws on Letters
of Credit or (ii) such Tranche 1 Credited-Linked Deposits are used in accordance
with Section 3.03(b), and, in each case, subject to clause (d) below) for the
Tranche 1 Banks equal at any time to the LIBOR Rate for the Interest Period in
effect for the Tranche 1 Credit-Linked Deposits at such time less three (3)
basis points. Such interest will be paid to the Tranche 1 Banks by the
Administrative Agent at the applicable Eurodollar Rate for an Interest Period of
1 month (or at an amount determined in accordance with clause (d) below, if
applicable) in arrears on the last day of each Interest Period applicable to the
Tranche 1 Credit-Linked Deposits.

          (c) The Company shall have no right, title or interest in or to the
Tranche 1 Credit-Linked Deposits and no obligations with respect thereto (except
to refund portions thereof used to reimburse an Issuing Bank with respect to
unreimbursed draws on Letters of Credit as provided in Section 3.05), it being
acknowledged and agreed by the parties hereto that (i) the making of the Tranche
1 Credit-Linked Deposits by the Tranche 1 Banks, the provisions of this Section
3.10 and the application of the Tranche 1 Credit-Linked Deposits in the manner
contemplated by Section 3.05 constitute agreements among the Administrative
Agent, each Issuing Bank issuing any Letter of Credit and each Tranche 1 Bank
with respect to the funding obligations of each Tranche 1 Bank in respect of its
participation in Letters of Credit and (ii) the use of Tranche 1 Credit-Linked
Deposits in accordance with Section 3.03(b) constitutes an agreement among the
Administrative Agent, the Tranche 1 Banks and the Tranche 2 Banks and, in each
case, do not constitute any loan or extension of credit to the Company.

          (d) If the Administrative Agent is advised by DB that it is not
offering U.S. dollar deposits (in the applicable amounts) in the London
interbank market, or the Administrative Agent determines that adequate and fair
means do not otherwise exist for ascertaining the

                                       51

<PAGE>

Eurodollar Rate for the Tranche 1 Credit-Linked Deposits (or any part thereof),
then the Tranche 1 Credit-Linked Deposits (or such parts, as applicable) shall
be invested so as to earn a return equal to the greater of the Federal Funds
Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with
banking industry rules on interbank compensation.

                                   ARTICLE IV.

                        INTEREST, FEES AND EXPENSES, ETC.

          4.01 Interest on Prime Rate Loans. Subject to the provisions of
Section 4.03, interest on Prime Rate Loans shall be payable monthly in arrears
on the first Business Day of each month at an interest rate per annum equal to
the Prime Rate plus the Applicable Margin calculated for the relevant period for
which payment is required to be made. In the event of any change in said Prime
Rate, the rate under this Section 4.01 shall change, effective as of the day the
Prime Rate changes without notice to the Company. Each determination by the
Agent of an interest rate under this Section 4.01 shall be conclusive and
binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.

          4.02 Interest on Eurodollar Rate Loans. Subject to the provisions of
Section 4.03, interest on Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be payable (a) for
Eurodollar Rate Loans with an Interest Period exceeding three (3) months, every
three (3) months in arrears during such Interest Period, (b) at the date of
conversion of such Eurodollar Rate Loan (or a portion thereof) to a Prime Rate
Loan and (c) at maturity of such Eurodollar Rate Loan at an interest rate per
annum during the Interest Period in effect for such Eurodollar Rate Loan equal
to the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period for such Eurodollar
Rate Loan plus the Applicable Margin calculated for the relevant period for
which payment is required to be made. The Administrative Agent upon determining
the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate for any Interest Period shall promptly notify the
Company and the Banks by telephone (confirmed promptly in writing) or in writing
thereof. Each determination by the Administrative Agent of an interest rate
under this Section 4.02 shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent
manifest error.

          4.03 Interest After Event of Default. Upon the occurrence and during
the continuation of an Event of Default resulting from the failure of the
Company to make any payment of principal or interest as provided in Section
9.01(a), or after notice is delivered to Company of the occurrence of any other
Event of Default, and at all times thereafter until the earlier of the date upon
which (i) all Obligations have been paid and satisfied in full or (ii) such
Event of Default shall no longer be continuing, interest on overdue principal on
the Loans and to the extent permitted by law, overdue interest in respect of
such Loans, shall be payable on demand at a rate per annum equal to the rate at
which such Loans would bear interest pursuant to Sections 4.01 and 4.02 above,
as the case may be, plus two percent (2.00%). In the event of any change in said
applicable interest rate, the rate under this Section 4.03 shall change,
effective as of the day the applicable interest rate changes, so as to remain
two percent (2.00%) above the then applicable interest rate.

          4.04 Reimbursement of Expenses.

          (a) From and after the Effective Date, the Company shall reimburse DB
within five (5) Business Days after demand (subject to Section 5.01(e)) (and the
Administrative Agent is entitled to charge the Loan Account) for all reasonable
Expenses of DB incurred by DB and upon receipt of invoices therefor and, if
requested by the Company, such reasonable backup materials and information as
the Company shall reasonably request.

          (b) The Company shall promptly reimburse the Agents and the Banks (and
the Administrative Agent is entitled to charge the Loan Account) upon furnishing
of an invoice for all costs and Expenses incurred by them in connection with the
enforcement, attempted enforcement or preservation of any rights or remedies
under any Loan Document and in connection with any workout, restructuring,
renegotiation or refinancing of the Loans and the other Obligations under the
Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

          4.05 Commitment Fees and Certain Other Fees.

          (a) The Company shall pay to the Administrative Agent, for
distribution in accordance with the terms thereof, all fees payable to each
Person as required by (i) the letter agreement among the Company, DBSI and DB
and (ii) the letter agreement among the Company, DB, DBSI and Fleet, both of
which are dated February 6, 2003 (the "Fee Letters").

          (b) The Company shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account
of each Tranche 2 Bank a commitment fee on the daily unused portion (whether or
not available to be used) of such Bank's Tranche 2 Commitment as set forth in
Schedule 1.01(a) to this Agreement (it being understood and agreed that Agent
Advances made on behalf of the Tranche 2 Banks will be considered utilization of
a Bank's Tranche 2 Commitment), as such Commitment may be increased or reduced
hereunder, for the period commencing on the Effective Date and continuing
thereafter, and computed on a daily basis on the first Business Day of each
month for the preceding calendar month by the Administrative Agent, based on an
amount equal to the daily unused portion of such Bank's Tranche 2 Commitment for
each day times the applicable rate per annum that is derived from the Commitment
Fee Rate for each such day. Except as set forth above, such commitment fee shall
accrue from the Effective Date to the Facility Expiry Date and shall be due and
payable monthly in arrears upon calculation by the Administrative Agent and such
fees shall be charged to the Loan Account in accordance with Section 2.08;
provided that, in connection with any termination of Commitments under Section
2.06, the accrued commitment fee calculated for the period ending on such date
shall also be paid on the date of such termination. The commitment fees provided
in this Section shall accrue at all times after the above-mentioned Effective
Date, including at any time during which one or more conditions in Article V are
not met.

          (c) The Company shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account
of each Tranche 1 Bank (i) a per annum fee equal to the aggregate Commitments of
the Tranche 1 Banks multiplied by the Applicable L/C Margin as set forth on the
Pricing Grid, and (ii) a per annum fee equal to the aggregate Commitments of the
Tranche 1 Banks multiplied by .0003 for the period on or prior to the second
anniversary of the Effective Date or at the rate set by the Administrative Agent
for the period thereafter in consultation with the Company. Each fee set

                                       53

<PAGE>

forth above shall accrue from the Effective Date to the Facility Expiry Date and
shall be due and payable on a monthly basis in arrears upon calculation by the
Administrative Agent as of the first Business Day of each calendar month for the
preceding month, and such fees shall be charged to the Loan Account in
accordance with Section 2.08; provided that, in connection with any termination
of Commitments under Section 2.06, the accrued fees under this subsection (c)
shall be calculated for the period ending on such date and shall also be paid on
the date of such termination. The fees provided in this Section shall accrue at
all times after the above-mentioned Effective Date, including at any time during
which one or more conditions in Article V are not met. In addition, the Company
shall reimburse the Administrative Agent for any losses or expenses incurred by
it in connection with the termination of the Tranche 1 Commitments (and the
related termination of the investment of the funds held in the Tranche 1
Credit-Linked Deposit Account) prior to any scheduled investment termination
date.

          (d) Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of
Default resulting from the failure of Company to make any payment of principal
or interest as provided in Section 9.01(a), or after notice is delivered to
Company of the occurrence of any other Event of Default, and at all times
thereafter until the earlier of the date upon which (i) all Obligations have
been paid and satisfied in full in cash (including any required Cash
Collateralization) or (ii) such Event of Default shall no longer be continuing,
as the case may be, the fees payable pursuant to Section 4.05(c)(i) shall be
increased by two percent (2.00%).

          4.06 Letter of Credit Fees.

          (a) The Company shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account
of each Tranche 2 Bank, a Letter of Credit fee (i) with respect to Standby
Letters of Credit in an amount equal to the product of (A) the applicable rate
per annum that is derived from the Applicable Margin for Letters of Credit
calculated for the relevant period for which payment is required to be made
times (B) the average daily maximum amount available to be drawn under such
Tranche 2 Bank's Pro Rata portion of Standby Letters of Credit while
outstanding, and (ii) with respect to Commercial Letters of Credit in an amount
equal to the product of (A) the applicable rate per annum that is derived from
the Applicable Margin for Letters of Credit calculated for the relevant period
for which payment is required to be made times (B) the average daily maximum
amount available to be drawn under such Tranche 2 Bank's Pro Rata portion of
Commercial Letters of Credit while outstanding, in each case computed on the
first Business Day of each calendar month for the preceding month based upon
Letters of Credit outstanding for that month as calculated by the Administrative
Agent. Such Letter of Credit fees shall be due and payable monthly in arrears
upon calculation by the Administrative Agent and such amounts shall be charged
to the Loan Account in accordance with Section 2.08. Solely for purposes of
determining fees payable in connection with the outstanding Letters of Credit
issued under the Existing Credit Agreement, such Letters of Credit shall be
considered as if they were issued on the Effective Date; it being understood
that the fronting fees with respect to such Letters of Credit have been paid.

          (b) The Company shall pay to each Issuing Bank a Letter of Credit
fronting fee for all Letters of Credit Issued by such Issuing Bank equal to
0.15% per annum of the average daily maximum amount available to be drawn under
all such Letters of Credit while outstanding Issued by such Issuing Bank,
computed on the first Business Day of each month for the

                                       54

<PAGE>

preceding month based upon Letters of Credit outstanding for that month as
calculated by the applicable Issuing Bank. Such fronting fees shall be due and
payable monthly in arrears, and such amounts shall be charged to the Loan
Account by the Administrative Agent upon the written instructions of the
Company.

          (c) The Company shall pay to each Issuing Bank from time to time on
demand, upon the furnishing of an invoice therefor, the normal issuance,
payment, amendment and other processing fees and commissions, and other standard
costs and charges, of such Issuing Bank relating to Letters of Credit Issued by
such Issuing Bank as from time to time in effect (the "Issuing Bank Fees").

          (d) Subject to clause (e) below, the Company shall pay to the
Administrative Agent for the account of each Tranche 1 Bank, a fee with respect
to any Letter of Credit which is reimbursed from funds in the Tranche 1
Credit-Linked Deposit Account which have not been reimbursed by the Company,
equal to the amount such Tranche 1 Bank would have received under Section
3.10(b) plus the Applicable Margin calculated for the relevant period for which
payment is required to be made less amounts already received pursuant to
Sections 3.05 and 3.10(b) by such Tranche 1 Bank for such relevant period.

          (e) Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of
Default resulting from the failure of Company to make any payment of principal
or interest as provided in Section 9.01(a), or after notice is delivered to
Company of the occurrence of any other Event of Default, and at all times
thereafter until the earlier of the date upon which (i) all Obligations have
been paid and satisfied in full in cash (including any required Cash
Collateralization) or (ii) such Event of Default shall no longer be continuing,
as the case may be, the applicable Letter of Credit Fees payable on overdue
amounts on demand pursuant to Section 4.06(a) shall be increased by two percent
(2.00%).

          4.07 Special Provisions Relating to Eurodollar Rate Loans.

          (a) Continuation. With respect to any Borrowing consisting of
Eurodollar Rate Loans, the Company may (so long as no Default or Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing) unless otherwise agreed to by the
Majority Banks, subject to the provisions of Section 4.07(c), elect to maintain
such Borrowing or any portion thereof as consisting of Eurodollar Rate Loans by
selecting a new Interest Period for such Borrowing, which new Interest Period
shall commence on the last day of the immediately preceding Interest Period.
Each selection of a new Interest Period shall be made by the giving of a Notice
of Continuation not later than 5:00 p.m. (New York City time), on the third
Business Day prior to the date of any such continuation relating to Eurodollar
Rate Loans, by the Company to the Administrative Agent. Such Notice of
Continuation by the Company shall be by telephone or facsimile transmission, and
if by telephone, promptly confirmed in writing, in each case specifying (i) the
date of such continuation, (ii) the aggregate amount of Loans subject to such
continuation and (iii) the duration of the selected Interest Period. The Company
may elect to maintain more than one Borrowing consisting of Eurodollar Rate
Loans by combining such Borrowings into one Borrowing and selecting a new
Interest Period pursuant to this Section 4.07(a); provided, however, that each
of the Borrowings so combined shall consist of Loans having Interest Periods
ending on the same date. If the Company shall fail to select a new Interest
Period for any

                                       55

<PAGE>

Borrowing consisting of Eurodollar Rate Loans in accordance with this Section
4.07(a), such Loans will automatically on the last day of the then existing
Interest Period therefor, convert into Prime Rate Loans.

          (b) Conversion. The Company may on any Business Day (so long as no
Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing) unless otherwise
agreed to by the Majority Banks, upon the giving of a Notice of Conversion given
to the Administrative Agent, and subject to the provisions of Section 4.07(c),
convert the entire amount of or a portion of all Loans of one Type comprising
the same Borrowing into Loans of another Type; provided, however, that any
conversion of any Eurodollar Rate Loans into Prime Rate Loans shall be made on,
and only on, the last day of an Interest Period for such Eurodollar Rate Loans
and, upon conversion of any Prime Rate Loans into Eurodollar Rate Loans, the
Company shall pay accrued interest to the date of conversions on the principal
amount converted. Each such Notice of Conversion shall be given not later than
1:00 p.m. (New York City time), on the day of any proposed conversion into Prime
Rate Loans and not later than 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the third
Business Day prior to the date of any proposed conversion into Eurodollar Rate
Loans. Subject to the restrictions specified above, each Notice of Conversion
shall be by telephone or facsimile transmission and, if by telephone, promptly
confirmed in writing, in each case specifying (i) the requested date of such
conversion, (ii) the Type of Loans to be converted, (iii) the portion of such
Type of Loan to be converted, (iv) the Type of Loan such Loans are to be
converted into and (v) if such conversion is into Eurodollar Rate Loans, the
duration of the Interest Period of such Loan. Each conversion shall be in an
aggregate amount for the Loans of all Tranche 2 Banks of not less than
$5,000,000 or in an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof. The
Company may elect to convert the entire amount of or a portion of all Loans of
one Type comprising more than one Borrowing into Loans of another Type by
combining such Borrowings into one Borrowing consisting of Loans of another
Type; provided, however, that if the Borrowings so combined consist of
Eurodollar Rate Loans, such Loans shall have Interest Periods ending on the same
date.

          (c) Certain Limitations on Eurodollar Rate Loans. The right of the
Company to maintain, select, continue or convert Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be
limited as follows:

               (i)  If the Administrative Agent is advised by DB that it is not
     offering U.S. dollar deposits (in the applicable amounts) in the London
     interbank market, or the Administrative Agent determines that adequate and
     fair means do not otherwise exist for ascertaining the Eurodollar Rate for
     Eurodollar Rate Loans comprising any requested Borrowing, continuation or
     conversion, the right of the Company to select or maintain Eurodollar Rate
     Loans for such Borrowing or any subsequent Borrowing shall be suspended
     until the Administrative Agent shall notify the Company and the Tranche 2
     Banks that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist, and
     each Loan comprising such Borrowing shall be made as a Prime Rate Loan.

               (ii) If the Tranche 2 Banks holding at least 51% of the Tranche 2
     Commitments shall, at least one Business Day before the date of any
     requested Borrowing of, continuation of or conversion into a Eurodollar
     Rate Loan, notify the Administrative Agent that the Eurodollar Rate for
     Loans comprising such Borrowing, continuation or conversion will not
     adequately reflect the cost to such Tranche 2 Banks of

                                       56

<PAGE>

     making or funding their respective Loans for such Borrowing or conversion,
     or maintaining such continuation, the right of the Company to select or
     continue Eurodollar Rate Loans for such Borrowing, continuation or
     conversion shall be suspended until such Tranche 2 Banks shall notify the
     Company and Administrative Agent that the circumstances causing such
     suspension no longer exist, and each Loan comprising such Borrowing,
     continuation or conversion shall be made as a Prime Rate Loan.

               (iii) If at any time any Tranche 2 Bank determines (which
     determination shall, absent manifest error, be conclusive and binding on
     all parties) that the making, continuation or conversion of any Loan as a
     Eurodollar Rate Loan has become unlawful or impermissible by reason of
     compliance by that Tranche 2 Bank with any law, governmental rule,
     regulation or order of any Governmental Authority (whether or not having
     the force of law or would result in costs or penalties), then, and in any
     such event, such Tranche 2 Bank may give notice of that determination, in
     writing, to the Company and the Administrative Agent and the Administrative
     Agent shall promptly transmit the notice to each other Tranche 2 Bank.
     Until such Tranche 2 Bank gives notice otherwise, the right of the Company
     to select Eurodollar Rate Loans from that Tranche 2 Bank shall be suspended
     and each Eurodollar Rate Loan outstanding from that Tranche 2 Bank shall
     automatically and immediately convert to a Prime Rate Loan. (iv) No Agent
     Advance shall be made as a Eurodollar Rate Loan.

               (v)   The right of the Company to select, continue or convert
     Eurodollar Rate Loans shall not be effective during the continuance of any
     Default or Event of Default unless otherwise agreed to by the Majority
     Banks.

               (vi)  There shall not be outstanding at any one time more than an
     aggregate of five (5) Loans which consist of Eurodollar Rate Loans.

          (d) Compensation.

               (i)   Each Notice of Continuation and Notice of Conversion shall
     be irrevocable by and binding on the Company. In the case of any Borrowing,
     continuation or conversion that the related Notice of Borrowing, Notice of
     Continuation or Notice of Conversion specifies is to be comprised of
     Eurodollar Rate Loans, the Company shall indemnify each Bank against any
     loss, cost or expense incurred by such Bank as a result of any failure to
     fulfill, on or before the date for such Borrowing, continuation or
     conversion specified in such Notice of Borrowing, Notice of Continuation or
     Notice of Conversion, the applicable conditions set forth in Article V or,
     in the event such conditions are satisfied, the failure of the Company to
     make such Borrowing, including, without limitation, in each case any loss
     (excluding loss of anticipated profits), cost or expense incurred by reason
     of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by
     such Bank to fund the Loan to be made by such Bank as part of such
     Borrowing, continuation or conversion.

               (ii)  If any payment of principal of, or conversion or
     continuation of, any Eurodollar Rate Loan is made other than on the last
     day of the Interest Period for

                                       57

<PAGE>

     such Loan as a result of a payment, prepayment, conversion or continuation
     of such Loan or acceleration of the maturity of the Notes pursuant to
     Article IX of this Agreement or for any other reason, the Company shall,
     upon demand by any Bank (with a copy of such demand to the Administrative
     Agent), pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Bank any
     amounts required to compensate such Bank for any additional losses, costs
     or expenses which it may reasonably incur as a result of such payment,
     including, without limitation, any loss (excluding loss of anticipated
     profits), cost or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or
     reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by any Bank to fund or
     maintain such Loan.

               (iii) Calculation of all amounts payable to a Bank under this
     Section 4.07(d) shall be made as though such Bank elected to fund all
     Eurodollar Rate Loans by purchasing U.S. dollar deposits in its Eurodollar
     Lending Office's interbank eurodollar market.

          4.08 Indemnification in Certain Events.

          (a) If after the Effective Date, either (i) any change in or in the
interpretation of any law or regulation is introduced, including, without
limitation, with respect to reserve requirements, applicable to DB, any Bank or
any Affiliate controlling any Bank, or (ii) a Bank or an Affiliate controlling a
Bank complies with any future guideline or request from any central bank or
other Governmental Authority and in the case of any event described in clause
(i) or (ii) such event increases the cost to DB, of issuing, making or
maintaining the Letter of Credit or complying with its obligations under this
Agreement or reduces the amount receivable in respect thereof by DB or such
Affiliate, or (iii) a Bank or an Affiliate controlling a Bank determines that
the adoption of any applicable law, rule or regulation regarding capital
adequacy, or any change therein, or any change in the interpretation or
administration thereof by any Governmental Authority, central bank or comparable
agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof has or would
have the effect described below or, a Bank or an Affiliate controlling a Bank
complies with any request or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or
not having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable
agency, and in the case of any event set forth in this clause (iii), such
adoption, change or compliance has or would have the direct or indirect effect
of reducing the rate of return on any of the capital as a consequence of its
obligations hereunder to a level below that which a Bank or an Affiliate
controlling a Bank could have achieved but for such adoption, change or
compliance (taking into consideration such Bank's or Affiliate's policies as the
case may be with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by such Bank
or such Affiliate controlling such Bank to be material, then in any such case,
the Company shall, upon demand by the Agent, pay to the Administrative Agent,
for the account of each applicable Bank, each applicable Affiliate controlling a
Bank or, each applicable Issuing Bank, additional amounts sufficient to
indemnify such Bank or the Affiliate controlling such Bank against such increase
in cost or reduction in amount receivable. A certificate as to the amount of
such increased cost or reduction in amount and setting forth in reasonable
detail the calculation thereof shall be submitted to the Company by the
Administrative Agent, or the applicable Bank or the applicable Affiliate
controlling such Bank, and shall be conclusive, absent manifest error. Any party
entitled to payment hereunder in respect of such increased cost or reduction in
amount shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different Lending Office to
the extent such designation could reduce or eliminate such payment.

                                       58

<PAGE>

          (b) It is understood that (i) Section 4.08(a) does not relate to any
changes in the rate of tax on the net income of the Issuing Bank, or any Bank,
or any Affiliate controlling such Bank imposed by the jurisdiction in which it
is organized, maintains a lending office or its principal office, or has any
other contacts or connections that would subject it to taxation therein
(excluding any connection or contact arising solely from the Issuing Bank, or
such Bank or such Affiliate having executed, delivered, performed its
obligations or received a payment under, or enforced this Agreement or any other
Loan Document) and (ii) any payment made under this Section 4.08 shall be made
without duplication for any item that is covered by Section 4.09.

          4.09 Net Payments.

          (a) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 4.09, all payments by
the Company hereunder or under any other Loan Document to or for the benefit of
any Bank, any Issuing Bank, the Collateral Agent or the Administrative Agent
shall be made without set-off, counterclaim or other defense and shall be made
free and clear of, and without deduction or withholding for, any Taxes. In
addition, the Company shall pay all Other Taxes.

          (b) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 4.09, the Company
agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Bank, the Issuing Bank, the
Collateral Agent and the Administrative Agent for the full amount of Taxes or
Other Taxes (including any additional Taxes or Other Taxes imposed by any
jurisdiction on amounts payable under this Section 4.09(b)) paid by any Bank,
any Issuing Bank, the Collateral Agent or the Administrative Agent in respect of
any sum payable hereunder or under any other Loan Document (including penalties,
interest, additions to tax and any reasonable expenses).

          (c) Payment under this indemnification shall be made within thirty
(30) days after the date any Bank, any Issuing Bank, the Collateral Agent or the
Administrative Agent makes written demand therefor.

          (d) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 4.09, if the Company
shall be required by law to deduct or withhold any Taxes or Other Taxes from or
in respect of any sum payable hereunder (or under any other Loan Document) to
any Bank, any Issuing Bank, the Collateral Agent or the Administrative Agent,
then:

               (i)   the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that
     after making all such required deductions and withholdings of Taxes or
     Other Taxes (including deductions and withholdings applicable to additional
     sums payable under this Section 4.09), such Bank, such Issuing Bank, the
     Collateral Agent or the Administrative Agent receives an amount equal to
     the sum it would have received had no such deductions or withholdings been
     made;

               (ii)  the Company shall make such deductions and withholdings;
     and

               (iii) the Company shall pay the full amount deducted or withheld
     to the relevant taxing authority or other authority in accordance with
     applicable law.

          (e) Within thirty (30) days after the date of any payment by the
Company of Taxes or Other Taxes, the Company shall furnish to the Administrative
Agent the original or a

                                       59

<PAGE>

certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof, or other evidence of
payment satisfactory to the Administrative Agent if available from the
appropriate taxing authority.

          (f) If any Bank, the Issuing Bank, the Collateral Agent or the
Administrative Agent receives a refund in respect of any amounts paid by the
Company pursuant to this Section 4.09, which refund in the good faith judgment
of such Bank, Issuing Bank, Collateral Agent or Administrative Agent is
allocable to such payment, it shall promptly notify the Company of such refund
and shall promptly repay such refund to the Company net of all out-of-pocket
expenses; provided, however, that the Company, upon the request of such Bank,
Issuing Bank, Collateral Agent or Administrative Agent, agrees to repay the
amount paid over in the event such Bank, Issuing Bank, Collateral Agent or
Administrative Agent is required to repay such refund.

          (g) If the Company would be required to pay additional amounts to any
Bank pursuant to paragraph (b) or (d) of this Section 4.09, then such Bank shall
use reasonable efforts (consistent with legal and regulatory restrictions) to
change the jurisdiction of its lending office so as to eliminate the obligation
of the Company to pay any such additional amounts which may thereafter accrue or
to indemnify such Bank in the future, if such change in the reasonable judgment
of such Bank is not otherwise materially disadvantageous to such Bank.

          (h) (i) Any Bank not organized under the laws of the United States
shall furnish to the Company or the Administrative Agent, two copies of IRS Form
W-8BEN or W-8ECI, or successor applicable form (which shall be accurate and
complete) as may be required to establish, as of the date of this Agreement, an
exemption from U.S. withholding taxes or backup withholding taxes in respect of
payments made under any Loan Document. In the event that a Bank assigns all or a
portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement, pursuant to Section
11.07, each assignee shall furnish to the Company or the Administrative Agent
two copies of IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI, or successor applicable form (which
shall be accurate and complete) as may be required to establish, as of the date
of the assignment, a full exemption from U.S. withholding taxes or back-up
withholding taxes in respect of payments made under this Agreement. The Company
and the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon the accuracy of any
such forms, documents or other information furnished to it by any Person and
shall have no obligation to make any additional payment or indemnify any Person
for any taxes, interest or penalties that would not have become payable by such
Person had such documentation been accurate.

          (ii) Each Bank that is not organized under the laws of the United
States (including any assignee pursuant to Section 11.07 that is not organized
under the laws of the United States) shall also deliver to the Company or the
Administrative Agent two further copies of said Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI, or
successor applicable forms, as the case may be, when requested to do so by the
Company or the Administrative Agent on or before the date that any such form
expires or becomes obsolete or otherwise is required to be resubmitted as a
condition to obtaining an exemption from a required withholding of U.S. federal
income tax or after the occurrence of any event requiring a change in the most
recent form previously delivered by it to the Administrative Agent or the
Company, and such extensions or renewals thereof as may reasonably be requested
by the Company or the Administrative Agent, certifying that such Bank is
entitled to receive payments hereunder or under any other Loan Documents without
deduction or withholding of any U.S. federal income taxes or at a reduced rate,
unless in any such case an event outside the

                                       60

<PAGE>

control of such Bank (including, without limitation, any change in treaty, law
or regulation) has occurred prior to the date on which any such delivery would
otherwise be required which renders all such forms inapplicable or which would
prevent such Bank from duly completing and delivering any such form with respect
to it and such Bank so advises the Company or the Administrative Agent. No Bank
shall be required to provide a form described in the preceding sentence unless
it is legally entitled to do so at the time such form is requested by the
Company.

          (i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Section
4.09, the Company shall not be required to pay any additional amounts pursuant
to this Section 4.09 to the extent that such additional amounts relate to Taxes
or Other Taxes (including obligations to deduct or withhold amounts with respect
thereto) for any period (i) that would not have been imposed but for the failure
of a Bank or any assignee thereof, to comply with Section 4.09(h) hereof (other
than if such failure is due to a change in law, regulation or treaty occurring
after the date on which a form originally was required to be provided) or (ii)
that are attributable to U.S. withholding taxes imposed (x) on the date the Bank
becomes a Lender under this Agreement or (y) other than as a result of a change
in law, regulation or treaty. If a Bank becomes subject to Taxes because of its
failure to deliver a form required hereunder, the Company shall take such steps
as the Bank shall reasonably request to assist such Bank to recover such Taxes.

          4.10 Affected Banks. If the Company is obligated to pay to any Bank or
an Issuing Bank any amount under Section 4.08 or 4.09 or if any Bank is a
Defaulting Bank, the Company may, if no Default or Event of Default then exists,
replace such Bank with another bank or may replace such Issuing Bank with
another letter of credit issuer in each case acceptable to the Administrative
Agent and the Issuing Banks (other than such Issuing Bank), and such Bank or
such Issuing Bank, as applicable, hereby agrees to be so replaced subject to the
following:

          (a) The obligations of the Company hereunder to the Bank or the
Issuing Bank to be replaced (including such increased or additional costs
incurred from the date of notice to the Company of such increase or additional
costs through the date such Bank or Issuing Bank is replaced hereunder) shall be
paid in full in cash to such Bank or Issuing Bank concurrently with such
replacement;

          (b) If such replacement is a result of increased costs under Section
4.08 or 4.09, the replacement Bank shall be a bank or other financial
institution acceptable to the Administrative Agent that is not subject to such
increased costs which caused the Company's election to replace any Bank
hereunder, and such replacement Bank shall execute and deliver to the
Administrative Agent such documentation satisfactory to the Administrative Agent
pursuant to which such replacement Bank is to become a party to this Agreement,
conforming to the provisions of Section 11.07, with a Commitment equal to that
of the Bank being replaced, shall make Loans in the aggregate principal amount
equal to the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Loans of the Bank
being replaced and shall be deemed to have acquired a participation in L/C
Obligations then outstanding equal to the participation therein of the Bank
being replaced;

          (c) Upon such execution and delivery of such documents referred to in
clause (b) and payment of the amounts referred to in clause (a), the replacement
bank shall be a "Bank"

                                       61

<PAGE>

with a Commitment as specified hereinabove and the Bank being replaced shall
cease to be a "Bank" hereunder, except with respect to indemnification
provisions under this Credit Agreement, which shall survive as to such replaced
Bank;

          (d) The Administrative Agent shall reasonably cooperate in
effectuating the replacement of any Bank or any Issuing Bank under this Section
4.10, but at no time shall the Administrative Agent be obligated to initiate any
such replacement;

          (e) Any Bank or the Issuing Bank replaced under this Section 4.10
shall be replaced at the Company's sole cost and expense and at no cost or
expense to the Administrative Agent or any of the Banks or the Issuing Bank; and

          (f) If the Company proposes to replace any Bank pursuant to this
Section 4.10 because the Bank seeks reimbursement under either Section 4.08 or
4.09, then it must also replace any other Bank who seeks reimbursement on a
proportionate basis (based upon such Bank's Commitment to the combined
Commitments) under such Sections.

          4.11 Sharing of Payments. If any Bank shall obtain any payment
(whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of set-off or
otherwise) on account of the Loans made by it or its participation in the L/C
Obligations in excess of its Pro Rata Share of payments on account of the Loans
or L/C Obligations obtained by all the Banks, such Bank shall forthwith purchase
from the other Banks such participations in the Loans made by them or in their
participation in Letters of Credit as shall be necessary to cause such
purchasing Bank to share the excess payment ratably with each of them; provided,
however, that if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter
recovered from such purchasing Bank, such purchase (or corresponding portion
thereof) from each Bank shall be rescinded, and each such Bank shall repay to
the purchasing Bank the purchase price to the extent of such recovery together
with an amount equal to such Bank's ratable share (according to the proportion
of (i) the amount of such Bank's required repayment to (ii) the total amount so
recovered from the purchasing Bank) of any interest or other amount paid or
payable by the purchasing Bank in respect to the total amount so recovered. The
Company agrees that any Bank so purchasing a participation from another Bank
pursuant to this Section 4.11 may, to the full extent permitted by law, exercise
all of its rights of payment (including the right of setoff) with respect to
such participation as fully as if such Bank were the direct creditor of the
Company in the amount of such participation.

          4.12 Calculations. All calculations of (i) interest with respect to
Eurodollar Rate Loans and per annum fees, shall be made by the Administrative
Agent, on the basis of a year of 360 days, or, if such computation would cause
the interest and fees chargeable hereunder to exceed the highest rate allowed by
applicable law, 365/366 days, and (ii) interest with respect to Prime Rate Loans
shall be made by the Administrative Agent on the basis of a year of 365/366
days, in each case to the extent applicable for the actual number of days
elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day) occurring in the
period for which such interest or fees are payable. Each determination by the
Administrative Agent of an interest rate or payment hereunder shall be
conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.

          5.04 Outstanding Loans and L/C Obligations. On the Effective Date, the

each Bank and the Company of the amounts of such reallocation of Loans and
notify each Bank of the amount, representing the portion of principal amount of
outstanding Loans, which such Bank will either advance or receive as a result of
such reallocation, and (b) prior to the close of business in New York City on

them as determined above. The making of an advance by a Bank as set forth above

set forth above shall be deemed to be a payment of Loans by the Company on the
date such payment is received.

authorizations, consents and approvals to own its assets, carry on its business
and to execute, deliver, and perform its obligations under the Loan Documents;

          (c) is duly qualified as a foreign corporation (or other entity) and
is licensed and in good standing under the laws of each jurisdiction where its
ownership, lease or operation of property or the conduct of its business
requires such qualification or license; and

          (d) is in compliance with all Requirements of Law and has all
necessary orders, authorizations, approvals, consents and waivers by any
Governmental Authority or other Person for the Company and its Subsidiaries to
own and operate their business;

except, in each case referred to in clause (c) or clause (d), to the extent that
the failure to do so could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect.

          6.02 Corporate Authorization; No Contravention. The execution,
delivery and performance by the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries of each
Loan Document to which such Person is party, have been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate (or equivalent) action, and do not and will not:

          (a) contravene the terms of any of that Person's Organization
Documents;

          (b) conflict with or result in any breach or contravention of, or the
creation of any Lien under, any document evidencing any Contractual Obligation
to which such Person is a party or any order, injunction, writ or decree of any
arbitrator or Governmental Authority to which such Person or its property is
subject; or

          (c) violate any Requirement of Law.

          6.03 Governmental Authorization. No approval, consent, exemption,
authorization, or other action by, or notice to, or filing with, any
Governmental Authority (except for filings in connection with the Liens granted
to the Administrative Agent under the Collateral Documents) is necessary or
required in connection with the execution, delivery or performance by, or
enforcement against, the Company or any the Restricted Subsidiaries of any Loan
Document to which such Person is a party.

          6.04 Binding Effect. Each Loan Document to which the Company or any of
its Restricted Subsidiaries is a party constitutes the legal, valid and binding
obligation of the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries to the extent it is a
party thereto, enforceable against such Person in accordance with its respective
terms, except as enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, or similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights
generally or by equitable principles.

          6.05 Litigation. Except as specifically disclosed in Schedule 6.05,
there are no actions, suits, proceedings, claims or disputes pending, or to the
best knowledge of the Company, threatened or contemplated, at law, in equity, in

                                       69

<PAGE>

          (a) purport to affect or pertain to any Loan Document, or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby; or

          (b) could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. No

restrain the execution, delivery or performance of any Loan Document, or
directing that the transactions provided for herein or therein not be
consummated as herein or therein provided.

          6.06 No Default. No Default or Event of Default exists or would result
from the incurring of any Obligations by the Company or from the grant or
perfection or continued perfection of the Liens of the Collateral Agent, in
favor of the Administrative Agent and the Banks on the Collateral. As of the
Effective Date, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in default
under or with respect to any Contractual Obligation in any respect which,
individually or together with all such defaults, could reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect, or that would, if such default had occurred
after the Effective Date, create an Event of Default under Section 9.01(e).

          (a) Each Plan is in compliance in all respects with the applicable
provisions of ERISA, the Code and other federal or state law, except for matters
which have not resulted and would not reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect. Each Plan which is intended to qualify under Section
401(a) of the Code has received, or will timely file for, a favorable
determination letter from the IRS and to the best knowledge of the Company,
nothing has occurred which would cause, or would reasonably be expected to
cause, the loss of such qualification. The Company and each ERISA Affiliate has
made all required contributions to all Plans, and no application for a funding
waiver or an extension of any amortization period pursuant to Section 412 of the
Code has been made with respect to any Plan.

          (b) There are no pending or, to the best knowledge of the Company,
threatened claims, actions or lawsuits, or action by any Governmental Authority,
with respect to any Plan which has resulted or could reasonably be expected to
result in a Material Adverse Effect. There has been no prohibited transaction or
violation of the fiduciary responsibility rules with respect to any Plan which
has resulted or could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect.

          (c) (i) No ERISA Event has occurred or is reasonably expected to
occur; (ii) no Pension Plan has any material Unfunded Pension Liability; and
(iii) neither the Company, any Restricted Subsidiary nor any ERISA Affiliate has
incurred, or reasonably expects to incur, any material liability under Title IV
of ERISA with respect to any Pension Plan (other than premiums due and not
delinquent under Section 4007 of ERISA), including but not limited to any
material liability under Section 4201 or 4243 of ERISA with respect to a
Multiemployer Plan and any material liability that could reasonably be expected
to result from the operation of Section 4069 or 4212(c) of ERISA.

otherwise due and payable, except those which are being contested in good faith
by appropriate proceedings and for which adequate reserves have been provided in

schedule may be amended with the approval of the Administrative Agent), there

<PAGE>

          (a) declare the commitment of each Bank to make Loans and any
obligation of any Issuing Bank to Issue Letters of Credit to be terminated,
whereupon such commitments and such obligations shall be terminated;

          (b) declare an amount equal to the maximum aggregate amount that is or
at any time thereafter may become available for drawing under any outstanding
Letters of Credit (whether or not any beneficiary shall have presented, or shall
be entitled at such time to present, the drafts or other documents required to
draw under such Letters of Credit) and any Outstanding Eligible LOIs to be
immediately due and payable, and declare the unpaid principal amount of all
outstanding Loans, all interest accrued and unpaid thereon, and all other
amounts owing or payable hereunder or under any other Loan Document to be
immediately due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or other
notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by the Company;

          (c) require the Company to immediately deposit with the Administrative
Agent for each Letter of Credit then outstanding, Cash or Cash Equivalents in an
amount equal to 100% of the greatest amount drawable thereunder; and

          (d) exercise on behalf of itself and the Banks all rights and remedies
available to it and the Banks under the Loan Documents or applicable law;

provided, however, that upon the occurrence of any event specified in Section
(f) or (g) of Section 9.01 (in the case of clause (i) of Section (g) upon the
expiration of the 60-day period mentioned therein), the obligation of each Bank
to make Loans and any obligation of any Issuing Bank to Issue Letters of Credit
shall automatically terminate and the unpaid principal amount of all outstanding
Loans and all interest and other amounts as aforesaid shall automatically become
due and payable without further act of the Administrative Agent, any Issuing
Bank or any Bank. If the Company makes any payments on Loans or to reimburse
unreimbursed drawings under Letters of Credit, in each case after the Banks have
exercised their remedies under Section 9.02(a) or the Banks have elected to have
the unpaid principal amount of all Loans and all interest and other amounts to
become due and payable, the Administrative Agent shall permanently reduce, to
the extent of such payments, the Commitments pro rata as between Tranche 1 Banks
and Tranche 2 Banks based on the Pro Rata Shares of the Banks during the
continuance of such events.

          9.03 Rights Not Exclusive. The rights provided for in this Agreement
and the other Loan Documents are cumulative and are not exclusive of any other

                                   ARTICLE X.

                THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND THE COLLATERAL AGENT

          10.01 Appointment of Agent.

          (a) Each Bank hereby designates DB as Administrative Agent to act as
herein specified. Each Bank hereby irrevocably authorizes, and each holder of
any Note or participation in any Letter of Credit by the acceptance of a Note or
participation shall be deemed irrevocably to authorize, the Administrative Agent
to take such action on its behalf under the provisions of this Agreement and the
Notes and any other instruments and agreements referred to herein and to
exercise such powers and to perform such duties hereunder and thereunder as are
specifically delegated to or required of the Administrative Agent by the terms
of this Agreement and thereof and such other powers as are reasonably incidental
thereto. The Administrative Agent shall designate the Collateral Agent to hold
all Collateral and shall itself hold all payments of principal, interest, fees,
charges and expenses received pursuant to any Loan Document for the benefit of
itself and the Banks to be distributed as provided herein. The Administrative
Agent may perform any of its duties hereunder by or through its agents or
employees.

          (b) The provisions of this Article X are solely for the benefit of the
Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and the Banks, and the Company shall
not have any rights as a third party beneficiary of any of the provisions of
this Article X (other than Section 10.09). In performing its functions and
duties under this Agreement, the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent
shall act solely as agent of the Banks and do not assume and shall not be deemed
to have assumed any obligation toward or relationship of agency or trust with or
for the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

          10.02 Nature of Duties of Administrative Agent. The Administrative
Agent shall have no duties or responsibilities except those expressly set forth
in the Loan Documents. Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its officers,
directors, employees or agents shall be liable for any action taken or omitted
by it as such hereunder or in connection herewith, unless caused by its or their
gross negligence or willful misconduct. The duties of the Administrative Agent
shall be mechanical and administrative in nature; the Administrative Agent shall
not have by reason of the Loan Documents a fiduciary relationship in respect of
any Bank; and nothing in the Loan Documents, expressed or implied, is intended
to or shall be so construed as to impose upon the Administrative Agent any
obligations in respect of the Loan Documents except as expressly set forth
herein or therein.

          10.03 Lack of Reliance on Agent-Related Persons.

          (a) Independently and without reliance upon any Agent-Related Persons,
each Bank, to the extent it deems appropriate, has made and shall continue to
make (i) its own independent investigation of the financial or other condition
and affairs of the Company and its Subsidiaries in connection with the taking or
not taking of any action in connection herewith and (ii) its own appraisal of
the creditworthiness of each of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and, except as
expressly provided in this Agreement, no Agent-Related Person shall have any
duty or responsibility, either initially or on a continuing basis, to provide
any Bank with any credit or

                                       102

<PAGE>

other information with respect thereto, whether coming into its possession
before the making of the Loans or the issuance of any Letter of Credit or at any
time or times thereafter.

          (b) No Agent-Related Person shall be responsible to any Bank for any
recitals, statements, information, representations or warranties herein or in
any document, certificate or other writing delivered in connection herewith or
for the execution, effectiveness, genuineness, validity, enforceability,
collectibility, priority or sufficiency of any Loan Document or the financial or
other condition of the Company or its Subsidiaries. No Agent-Related Person
shall be required to make any inquiry concerning either the performance or
observance of any of the terms, provisions or conditions of any Loan Document,
or the financial condition of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or the
existence or possible existence of any Default or Event of Default, unless
specifically requested to do so in writing by any Bank.

          (c) For purposes of determining compliance with the conditions
specified in Section 5.01, each Bank shall be deemed to have consented to,
approved or accepted or to be satisfied with each document or other matter
required thereunder to be consented to or approved by or acceptable or
satisfactory to such Bank unless an officer of the Administrative Agent
responsible for the transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents shall have
received written notice from such Bank prior to the Effective Date specifying
its objection thereto and either such objection shall not have been withdrawn by
written notice to the Administrative Agent to that effect or such Bank shall not
have made available to the Administrative Agent the Bank's ratable portion of
the outstanding Loans.

          10.04 Certain Rights of the Administrative Agent. The Administrative
Agent shall have the right to request instructions from the Majority Banks at
any time. If the Administrative Agent shall request instructions from the
Majority Banks or Banks, as applicable, with respect to any act or action
(including the failure to act) in connection with any Loan Document, the
Administrative Agent shall be entitled to refrain from such act or taking such
action unless and until the Administrative Agent shall have received
instructions from the Majority Banks, and the Administrative Agent shall not
incur liability to any Person by reason of so refraining. Without limiting the
foregoing, no Bank shall have any right of action whatsoever against the
Administrative Agent as a result of the Administrative Agent acting or
refraining from acting hereunder in accordance with the instructions of the
Majority Banks.

          10.05 Reliance by Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall
be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any note,
writing, resolution, notice, statement, certificate, telex, teletype or
telecopier message, cablegram, radiogram, order or other documentary,
teletransmission or telephone message believed by it to be genuine and correct
and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper person. The Administrative
Agent may consult with legal counsel (including counsel for the Company with
respect to matters concerning the Company), independent public accountants and
other experts selected by it and shall not be liable for any action taken or
omitted to be taken by it in good faith in accordance with the advice of such
counsel, accountants or experts.

          10.06 Indemnification of Agent-Related Persons. To the extent any
Agent-Related Person is not reimbursed and indemnified by the Company, each Bank
will reimburse and indemnify such Agent-Related Person, in proportion to its
respective Commitment, for and

                                       103

<PAGE>

against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties,
actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses (including attorney costs) or
disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred
by or asserted against such Agent-Related Person in performing its duties
hereunder, in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement, provided
that no Bank shall be liable for any portion of such liabilities, obligations,
losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or
disbursements resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such
Agent-Related Person.

          10.07 Administrative Agent in Individual Capacity. With respect to its
obligation to lend under this Agreement, the Loans made by it and the Notes
issued to it, and its participation in Letters of Credit issued hereunder, DB
shall have the same rights and powers hereunder as any other Bank or holder of a
Note or participation interests and may exercise the same as though it was not
performing the duties specified herein; and the terms "Banks," "Majority Banks,"
"holders of Notes," or any similar terms shall, unless the context clearly
otherwise indicates, include the Administrative Agent in its individual
capacity. DB may accept deposits from, lend money to, acquire equity interests
in, and generally engage in any kind of banking, trust, financial advisory or
other business with the Company or any Affiliate of the Company as if it were
not performing the duties specified herein, and may accept fees and other
consideration from the Company for services in connection with the Loan
Documents and otherwise without having to account for the same to the Banks.

          10.08 Holders of Notes. The Administrative Agent may deem and treat
the payee of any Note as the owner thereof for all purposes of the Loan
Documents unless and until a written notice of the assignment or transfer
thereof shall have been filed with the Administrative Agent. Any request,
authority or consent of any Person who, at the time of making such request or
giving such authority or consent, is the holder of any Note, shall be conclusive
and binding on any subsequent holder, transferee or assignee of such Note or of
any Note or Notes issued in exchange therefor.

          10.09 Successor Administrative Agent.

          (a) The Administrative Agent may, upon thirty (30) Business Days'
notice to the Banks and the Company, resign at any time (effective upon the
appointment of a successor Administrative Agent pursuant to the provisions of
this Section 10.09) by giving written notice thereof to the Banks and the
Company. Such resignation of the Administrative Agent shall also operate as a
resignation of DB as an Issuing Bank (in respect of any Letters of Credit to be
issued after such resignation) and as Collateral Agent. Upon any such
resignation, the Majority Banks shall have the right, upon five (5) days' notice
and approval by the Company (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed), to appoint a successor Administrative Agent which shall also serve
as a successor Issuing Bank and successor Collateral Agent. If no successor
Administrative Agent (i) shall have been so appointed by the Majority Banks, and
(ii) shall have accepted such appointment, within thirty (30) days after the
retiring Administrative Agent's giving of notice of resignation then, upon five
(5) days notice, the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Banks,
appoint a successor Administrative Agent, which shall also serve as a successor
Issuing Bank and successor Collateral Agent.

                                       104

<PAGE>

          (b) Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Administrative Agent
hereunder by a successor Administrative Agent, such successor Administrative
Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers,
privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring
Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations under
this Agreement. After any retiring Administrative Agent's resignation hereunder
as Administrative Agent, the provisions of this Article X shall inure to its
benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was
Administrative Agent under this Agreement.

          (c) In the event of a material breach by the Administrative Agent of
its duties hereunder, the Administrative Agent may be removed by the Majority
Banks (other than the Administrative Agent in its individual capacity and
without giving effect to any Loans or Commitments made by the Administrative
Agent in its individual capacity) for cause and the provisions of this Section
10.09 shall apply to the appointment of a successor Administrative Agent.
Removal of DB as Administrative Agent shall also operate as a removal of DB as
an Issuing Bank and Collateral Agent.

          10.10 Collateral Matters.

          (a) Each Bank authorizes and directs the Collateral Agent to enter
into the Collateral Documents for the benefit of the Banks. Each Bank hereby
agrees, and each holder of any Note by the acceptance thereof will be deemed to
agree, that, except as otherwise set forth herein, any action taken by the
Majority Banks in accordance with the provisions of this Credit Agreement or the
Collateral Documents, and the exercise by the Majority Banks of the powers set
forth herein or therein, together with such other powers as are reasonably
incidental thereto, shall be authorized and binding upon all of the Banks. The
Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent are hereby authorized on behalf of
all of the Banks, without the necessity of any notice to or further consent from
any Bank, from time to time prior to an Event of Default, to take any action
with respect to any Collateral or Collateral Documents which may be necessary to
perfect and maintain perfected the security interest in and liens upon the
Collateral granted pursuant to the Collateral Documents.

          (b) The Banks hereby authorize the Administrative Agent and the
Collateral Agent, at their option and in their discretion, to release any Lien
granted to or held by the Collateral Agent upon any Collateral (i) upon
termination of the Commitments and payment in full in cash and satisfaction of
all of the Obligations (other than those expressly stated to survive termination
of this Agreement, the repayment of the Loans and the termination of the
Commitments) at any time arising under or in respect of this Agreement or the
Loan Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (including any
required Cash Collateralization), (ii) constituting property being sold or
disposed of upon receipt of the proceeds of such sale required (if applicable)
to be delivered to the Administrative Agent if the Company certifies to the
Administrative Agent that the sale or disposition is made in compliance with
Section 8.02 (and the Administrative Agent may rely conclusively on any such
certificate, without further inquiry), (iii) if approved, authorized or ratified
in writing by the Majority Banks, unless such release is required to be approved
by all of the Banks hereunder or (iv) constituting Cash, Cash Equivalents or
Qualifying Investments used for the purposes set forth in Sections 8.01(g), (m),
(o) or (u); provided, that at the time of such release no Default or Event of

                                       105

<PAGE>

Default shall have occurred and be continuing; and provided, further, that, with
respect to clause (iv), at the time of such release or grant of Lien under
Section 8.01(g), (m), (o) or (u), and after giving effect thereto, the Effective
Amount of all Loans then outstanding plus the Effective Amount of all L/C
Obligations plus the Effective Amount of all Outstanding Eligible LOIs does not
exceed the Borrowing Base set forth in the most recent Borrowing Base
Certificate delivered in accordance with Section 7.02(e). Upon request by the
Administrative Agent at any time, the Banks will confirm in writing the
Administrative Agent's and the Collateral Agent's authority to release
particular types or items of Collateral pursuant to this Section 10.10.

          (c) Upon any sale and transfer of Collateral which is expressly
permitted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, or consented to in writing by
the Majority Banks or all of the Banks, as applicable and upon at least five (5)
Business Days prior written request by the Company, the Collateral Agent shall
(and is hereby irrevocably authorized by the Banks to) execute such documents as
may be necessary to evidence the release of the Liens granted to the Collateral
Agent for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Banks herein or
pursuant to this Agreement upon the Collateral that was sold or transferred;
provided that (i) the Collateral Agent shall not be required to execute any such
document on terms which, in the Collateral Agent's opinion, would expose the
Collateral Agent to liability or create any obligation or entail any consequence
other than the release of such Liens without recourse or warranty and (ii) such
release shall not in any manner discharge, affect or impair the Obligations or
any Liens upon (or obligations of the Company or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries in respect of) all interests retained by the Company or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries, including (without limitation) the proceeds of the
sale, all of which shall continue to constitute part of the Collateral. In the
event of any sale or transfer of collateral, or any foreclosure with respect to
any of the collateral, the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent shall
be authorized to deduct all of the expenses reasonably incurred from the
proceeds of any such sale, transfer or foreclosure.

          (d) The Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent shall have no
obligation whatsoever to the Banks or to any other Person to assure that the
Collateral exists or is owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or is
cared for, protected or insured or that the Liens granted to the Collateral
Agent herein or pursuant to this Agreement have been properly or sufficiently or
lawfully created, perfected, protected or enforced or are entitled to any
particular priority, or to exercise or to continue exercising at all or in any
manner or under any duty of care, disclosure or fidelity any of the rights,
authorities and powers granted or available to the Administrative Agent and the
Collateral Agent in this Section 10.10 or to the Collateral Agent in any of the
Collateral Documents, it being understood and agreed that in respect of the
Collateral, or any act, omission or event related thereto, the Administrative
Agent and the Collateral Agent may act in any manner they may deem appropriate
in their sole discretion, given the Administrative Agent's and the Collateral
Agent's own interest in the Collateral as one of the Banks and that the
Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent shall have no duty or liability
whatsoever to the Banks, except for their gross negligence or willful
misconduct; provided that the Administrative Agent has prepared for filing in
the appropriate jurisdictions, financing statements, financing statements in
lieu of continuation statements or amendments thereto, as appropriate in the
reasonable discretion of the Administrative Agent, and has arranged for
appropriate recordation thereof in each such jurisdiction.

<PAGE>

          10.11 Actions with Respect to Default. In addition to the
Administrative Agent's right to take actions on its own accord as permitted
under this Agreement, the Administrative Agent shall take such action with
respect to a Default or Event of Default as shall be directed by the Majority
Banks; provided that until the Administrative Agent shall have received such
directions, the Administrative Agent shall (but shall not be obligated to) take
such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default or
Event of Default as it shall deem advisable and in the best interests of the
Banks.

          10.12 Delivery of Information. The Administrative Agent shall not be
required to deliver to any Bank originals or copies of any documents,
instruments, notices, communications or other information received by the
Administrative Agent from the Company, Holdings, any of their respective
Subsidiaries, the Majority Banks, any Bank or any other Person under or in
connection with any Loan Document except (i) as specifically provided in any
Loan Document and (ii) as specifically requested from time to time in writing by
any Bank with respect to a specific document, instrument, notice or other
written communication received by and in the possession of the Administrative
Agent at the time of receipt of such request and then only in accordance with
such specific request.

          10.13 Liability of Agent-Related Persons. None of the Agent-Related
Persons shall (i) be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by any
of them under or in connection with any Loan Document or the transactions
contemplated thereby (except for its own gross negligence or willful
misconduct), or (ii) be responsible in any manner to any of the Banks for any
recital, statement, representation or warranty made by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates, or any officer thereof, contained in any Loan
Document, or in any certificate, report, statement or other document referred to
or provided for in, or received by any Agent-Related Person under or in
connection with any Loan Document, or for the value of or title to any
Collateral, or the validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or
sufficiency of any Loan Document, or for any failure of the Company or any other
party to any Loan Document to perform its obligations hereunder or thereunder.
No Agent-Related Person shall be under any obligation to any Bank to ascertain
or to inquire as to the observance or performance of any of the agreements
contained in, or conditions of, any Loan Document, or to inspect the properties,
books or records of the Company or any of the Company's Subsidiaries or
Affiliates.

          10.14 Agents Other Than Administrative Agent. Unless expressly
provided for herein, none of the Banks identified on the facing page or
signature pages of this Agreement as the Syndication Agent shall have any
obligation, liability, responsibility or duty under this Agreement other than,
in the case of the Syndication Agent, those applicable to all Banks as such.
Each Bank acknowledges that it has not relied, and will not rely, on any of the
Banks so identified in deciding to enter into this Agreement or in taking or not
taking action hereunder.

<PAGE>

          (c) Any agreement of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent
and the Banks herein to receive certain notices by telephone or facsimile is
solely for the convenience and at the request of the Company. The Administrative
Agent, the Collateral Agent and the Banks shall be entitled to rely on the
authority of any Person purporting to be a Person authorized by the Company to
give such notice and the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and the
Banks shall not have any liability to the Company or other Person on account of
any action taken or not taken by the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent
or the Banks in reliance upon such telephonic or facsimile notice. The
obligation of the Company to repay the Loans and L/C Obligations shall not be
affected in any way or to any extent by any failure by the Administrative Agent,
the Collateral Agent and the Banks to receive written confirmation of any
telephonic or facsimile notice or the receipt by the Administrative Agent, the
Collateral Agent and the Banks of a confirmation which is at variance with the
terms understood by the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and the Banks

exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege.

          11.04 Indemnity.

          (a) Whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are
consummated, the Company shall indemnify, defend and hold the Agent-Related
Persons, each Issuing Bank and each Bank, their respective Affiliates and each
of their respective officers, directors, trustees, employees, counsel, agents
and attorneys-in-fact (each, an "Indemnified Person") harmless from and against
any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions,
judgments, suits, costs, charges, expenses and disbursements (including fees and
expenses of any law firm or external counsel) of any kind or nature whatsoever
which may at any time (including at any time following repayment of the Loans,
the termination of the Commitments and the Letters of Credit and the
termination, resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent or
replacement of any Bank) be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against any such
Person in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any document
contemplated by or referred to herein, or the transactions contemplated hereby,
or any action taken or omitted by any such Person under or in connection with
any of the foregoing, including with respect to any investigation, litigation or
proceeding (including any Insolvency Proceeding or appellate proceeding) related
to or arising out of any Loan Document or the Loans or Letters of Credit or the
use of the proceeds thereof, whether or not any Indemnified Person is a party
thereto (all the foregoing, collectively, the "Indemnified Liabilities");
provided that the Company shall have no obligation hereunder to any Indemnified
Person with respect to Indemnified Liabilities resulting primarily from the
gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnified Person. The
agreements in this Section shall survive payment of all other Obligations.

          (b) (i) The Company shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless each
Indemnified Person, from and against any and all claims, liabilities,
obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs,
charges, expenses or disbursements (including

                                       110

<PAGE>

reasonable (giving due regard to prevailing circumstances) fees and expenses of
any law firm or external counsel and the allocated cost of internal
environmental audit or review services), which may be incurred by or asserted
against such Indemnified Person in connection with or arising out of any pending
or threatened investigation, litigation or proceeding, or any action taken by
any Person, with respect to any Environmental Claim arising out of or related to
any property subject to a mortgage in favor of the Collateral Agent or any Bank.
No action taken by legal counsel chosen by the Administrative Agent, the
Collateral Agent or any Bank in defending against any such investigation,
litigation or proceeding or requested remedial, removal or response action shall
vitiate or in any way impair the Company's obligation and duty hereunder to
indemnify and hold harmless the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and
each Bank.

          (ii) In no event shall any site visit, observation, or testing by the
Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or any Bank (or any contractee of the
Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or any Bank) be deemed a
representation or warranty by the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or
any Bank that Hazardous Materials are or are not present in, on, or under, the
site, or that there has been or shall be compliance with any Environmental Law.
Neither the Company nor any other Person is entitled to rely on any site visit,
observation, or testing by the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or any
Bank. Neither the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent nor any Bank owes
any duty of care to protect the Company or any other Person against, or to
inform the Company or any other party of, any Hazardous Materials or any other
adverse condition affecting any site or property. Neither the Administrative
Agent, the Collateral Agent nor any Bank shall be obligated to disclose to the
Company or any other Person any report or findings made as a result of, or in
connection with, any site visit, observation, or testing by the Administrative
Agent, the Collateral Agent or any Bank. The Company hereby acknowledges,
represents and warrants that the Company and its Subsidiaries are solely
responsible for the management and operation of the Facilities and that the
financial covenants and capital expenditure covenants set forth herein have been
set, by mutual agreement based upon financial information provided by the
Company, at levels the Company has determined, based on information known to the
Company at this time, will permit the expenditure of such amounts as are
necessary to insure that the Facilities comply with applicable Environmental
Laws at all times. Notwithstanding such covenants, but without in any way
limiting the rights and remedies of the Banks hereunder, the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall have the sole responsibility for ensuring that the Facilities
comply with applicable Environmental Laws and shall remain obligated to make all
expenditures necessary to ensure such compliance.

          (c) Survival; Defense. The obligations in this Section shall survive
payment of all other Obligations and the termination of the Commitments. At the
election of any Indemnified Person, the Company shall defend such Indemnified
Person using legal counsel satisfactory to such Indemnified Person in such
Person's sole discretion, at the sole cost and expense of the Company. All
amounts owing under this Section shall be paid within thirty (30) days after
demand.

          11.05 Marshaling; Payments Set Aside. Neither the Administrative
Agent, the Collateral Agent, nor the Banks shall be under any obligation to
marshal any assets in favor of the Company or any other Person or against or in
payment of any or all of the Obligations. To the extent that the Company makes a
payment to the Administrative Agent or the Banks, or the

                                       111

<PAGE>

Administrative Agent or the Banks exercise their right of set-off, and such
payment or the proceeds of such set-off or any part thereof are subsequently
invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required
(including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the Administrative Agent
or such Bank in its discretion) to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other
party, in connection with any Insolvency Proceeding or otherwise, then (a) to
the extent of such recovery the obligation or part thereof originally intended
to be satisfied shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as if
such payment had not been made or such set-off had not occurred, and (b) each
Bank severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent upon demand its pro
rata share of any amount so recovered from or repaid by the Administrative
Agent.

          11.06 Successors and Assigns. The provisions of this Agreement shall
be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties to this Agreement and
their respective successors and assigns subject to Section 11.07.

          11.07 Assignments, Participations, etc.

          (a) Company Assignment. The Company shall not assign this Agreement,
or any rights or obligations hereunder, without the prior written consent of the
Administrative Agent and all of the Banks; any assignment in violation of the
foregoing shall be void.

          (b) Bank Assignments. Each Bank may assign to one or more banks or
other institutions (including funds that buy or invest in loans) that are
legally permitted by their constituent documents to be a "Bank" for purposes of
this Agreement all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this
Agreement, the Notes and the other Loan Documents, with (subject to the
penultimate sentence of this paragraph) the consent of the Administrative Agent,
the Issuing Banks, and, so long as there is no Default or Event of Default, the
Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, and upon
execution and delivery to the Administrative Agent, for its acceptance and
recording in the Register (as defined below), of an agreement in substantially
the form of Exhibit H (an "Assignment and Assumption Agreement"), together with
surrender of any Note or Notes subject to such assignment and a processing and
recordation fee of $3,000 payable to the Administrative Agent for its account.
Subject to the penultimate sentence of this paragraph, no such assignment shall
be for less than $5,000,000 of the combined Commitments (or $1,000,000 in the
aggregate to Related Funds if such assignment is with respect to a Tranche 1
Commitment), unless it is to another Bank, to a Related Fund or unless it is an
assignment of all of a Bank's Pro Rata Share of outstanding Loans. This Section
does not apply to branches and Affiliates of a Bank, it being understood that a
Bank may make, carry or transfer Loans at or for the account of any of its
branch offices or Affiliates without consent of the Administrative Agent., the
Issuing Banks or the Company. No consent (other than the consent of the
Administrative Agent), or minimum shall apply to any assignment by the initial
Tranche 1 Bank to any bank or other financial institution (including funds that
buy or invest in loans) so long as such investor or lender is legally permitted
under its constituent documents to receive such assignment, and no consent,
minimum or processing and recordation fee of $3,000 shall apply to any
assignment by a Bank to any Related Fund of such Bank or any other Bank. Nothing
in this Agreement shall prevent or prohibit any Bank from pledging its Loans and
Notes hereunder to a Federal Reserve Bank in support of borrowings made by such
Bank from such Federal Reserve Bank and, with prior notification to the
Administrative Agent (but without the

                                       112

<PAGE>

consent of the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or the Company), any Bank
which is a fund that buys or invests in loans may pledge all or any portion of
its Loans and Notes to its trustee, to a collateral agent or to another creditor
providing credit or credit support to such Bank in support of its obligations to
such trustee, such collateral agent or a holder of such obligations, or such
other creditor as the case may be. No pledge pursuant to this clause (b) shall
release such Bank from any of its obligations hereunder.

          (c) Agent's Register. The Administrative Agent shall maintain a
register of the names and addresses of the Banks, their Commitments, and the
principal amount of their Loans (the "Register"). The Agent shall also maintain
a copy of each Assignment and Assumption Agreement delivered to and accepted by
it and modify the Register to give effect to each Assignment and Assumption
Agreement. Upon its receipt of each Assignment and Assumption Agreement and
surrender of the affected Note or Notes in accordance with Section 11.07(b), the
Agent will give prompt notice thereof to the Company and deliver to the Company
a copy of the Assignment and Assumption Agreement and the surrendered Note or
Notes. Within five (5) Business Days after its receipt of such notice, the
Company shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent a new Note or
Notes to the order of the assignee in the amount of the Commitment or
Commitments assumed by it and to the assignor in the amount of the Commitment or
Commitments retained by it, if any. Such new Note or Notes shall re-evidence the
Indebtedness outstanding under the surrendered Note or Notes and shall be dated
as of the Effective Date. The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely
upon the Register exclusively for purposes of identifying the Banks hereunder.

          (d) Bank Participations. Each Bank may sell participations (without
the consent of the Administrative Agent, the Company or any other Bank) to one
or more parties in or to all or a portion of its rights and obligations under
this Agreement, the Notes and the other Loan Documents. Notwithstanding a Bank's
sale of a participation interest, its obligations hereunder shall remain
unchanged. The Company, the Agent, and the other Banks shall continue to deal
solely and directly with such Bank. No participant shall have rights to approve
any amendment or waiver of this Agreement except to the extent such amendment or
waiver would (i) increase the commitment of the Bank from whom the participant
purchased its participation interest, (ii) reduce the principal of, or rate or
amount of interest on the Loans subject to such participation, (iii) postpone
any date fixed for any payment of principal of, or interest on, the Loans
subject to the participation interest, and (iv) release all or a substantial
portion of the Collateral, other than, in each case, when otherwise permitted
hereunder.

          (e) Disclosure of Information. In connection with their efforts to
assign or sell participations pursuant to Sections 11.07(b) and (d), the
Administrative Agent or the Banks may disclose any information they have, now or
in the future, with respect to the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries
to prospective assignees or purchasers, provided that such prospective assignees
or purchasers agree in writing to be bound by the provisions of Section 11.08.

          11.08 Confidentiality. Except as otherwise provided in this Section
11.08, each Bank agrees that it will not disclose without the prior consent of
the Company, any information with respect to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries which is furnished pursuant to this Agreement and which is
designated by the Company to the Banks in writing as confidential,

                                       113

<PAGE>

provided that any Bank may disclose any such information (a) to its Affiliates,
employees, auditors or counsel, or to another Bank if the disclosing Bank or
such disclosing Bank's holding or parent company in its reasonable discretion
determines that any such party should have access to such information, provided
that each such person will be advised of the confidential nature of such
information, (b) as has become generally available to the public, (c) as may be
required or appropriate in any report, statement or testimony submitted to any
Governmental Authority having or claiming to have jurisdiction over such Bank,
(d) as may be required or appropriate in response to any summons or subpoena or
in connection with any litigation, (e) any Person to which such Bank offers to
sell all or any portion of its Commitment or a participation therein provided
such Person agrees to keep such information confidential on the terms set forth
in this Section 11.08, and (f) in order to comply with any Requirement of Law.

          11.09 Set-off. In addition to any rights and remedies of the Banks
provided by law, if an Event of Default exists or the Loans have been
accelerated, each Bank (other than the Tranche 1 Banks unless the Loans have
been accelerated) is authorized at any time and from time to time, without prior
notice to the Company, any such notice being waived by the Company to the full
extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or
special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held by, and other
indebtedness at any time owing by, such Bank to or for the credit or the account
of the Company against any and all Obligations owing to such Bank, now or
hereafter existing, irrespective of whether or not the Administrative Agent or
such Bank shall have made demand under this Agreement or any Loan Document and
although such Obligations may be contingent or unmatured or fully secured. Each
Bank agrees promptly to notify the Company and the Administrative Agent after
any such set-off and application made by such Bank; provided, however, that the
failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and
application.

          11.10 Notification of Addresses, Lending Offices, Etc. Each Bank shall
notify the Administrative Agent in writing of any changes in the address to
which notices to the Bank should be directed, of addresses of any Lending
Office, of payment instructions in respect of all payments to be made to it
hereunder and of such other administrative information as the Administrative
Agent shall reasonably request.

          11.11 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
separate counterparts, each of which, when so executed, shall be deemed an
original, and all of said counterparts taken together shall be deemed to
constitute but one and the same instrument.

          11.12 Severability. The illegality or unenforceability of any
provision of this Agreement or any instrument or agreement required hereunder
shall not in any way affect or impair the legality or enforceability of the
remaining provisions of this Agreement or any instrument or agreement required
hereunder.

          11.13 No Third Parties Benefitted. This Agreement is made and entered
into for the sole protection and legal benefit of the Company, the Banks, the
Administrative Agent and the Agent-Related Persons, and their permitted
successors and assigns, and no other Person shall be a direct or indirect legal
beneficiary of, or have any direct or indirect cause of action or claim in
connection with, this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents.

          11.14 Governing Law and Jurisdiction.

          (a) THIS AGREEMENT AND THE NOTES SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED
IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK; PROVIDED THAT THE
ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND THE BANKS SHALL RETAIN ALL RIGHTS ARISING UNDER FEDERAL
LAW.

          (b) ANY LEGAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING WITH RESPECT TO ANY LOAN DOCUMENT
MAY BE BROUGHT IN THE COURTS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK OR OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK, AND BY EXECUTION AND DELIVERY OF THIS
AGREEMENT, EACH OF THE COMPANY, THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, THE ISSUING BANKS AND
THE BANKS CONSENTS, FOR ITSELF AND IN RESPECT OF ITS PROPERTY, TO THE
NON-EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THOSE COURTS. EACH OF THE COMPANY, THE
ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, THE ISSUING BANKS AND THE BANKS IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY
OBJECTION, INCLUDING ANY OBJECTION TO THE LAYING OF VENUE OR BASED ON THE
GROUNDS OF FORUM NON CONVENIENS, WHICH IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE
BRINGING OF ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING IN SUCH JURISDICTION IN RESPECT OF THIS
AGREEMENT OR ANY DOCUMENT RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT. THE COMPANY, THE
ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, THE ISSUING BANKS AND THE BANKS EACH WAIVE PERSONAL
SERVICE OF ANY SUMMONS, COMPLAINT OR OTHER PROCESS, WHICH MAY BE MADE BY ANY
OTHER MEANS PERMITTED BY NEW YORK LAW.

          11.15 Waiver of Jury Trial. THE COMPANY, THE ISSUING BANKS, THE BANKS
AND THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT EACH WAIVE THEIR RESPECTIVE RIGHTS TO A TRIAL BY
JURY OF ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION BASED UPON OR ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO
THE LOAN DOCUMENTS, OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY, IN ANY
ACTION, PROCEEDING OR OTHER LITIGATION OF ANY TYPE BROUGHT BY ANY OF THE PARTIES
AGAINST ANY OTHER PARTY OR ANY AGENT-RELATED PERSON, PARTICIPANT OR ASSIGNEE,
WHETHER WITH RESPECT TO CONTRACT CLAIMS, TORT CLAIMS, OR OTHERWISE. THE COMPANY,
THE BANKS, THE ISSUING BANKS AND THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT EACH AGREE THAT ANY
SUCH CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE TRIED BY A COURT TRIAL WITHOUT A JURY.
WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, THE PARTIES FURTHER AGREE THAT THEIR RESPECTIVE
RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IS WAIVED BY OPERATION OF THIS SECTION AS TO ANY
ACTION, COUNTERCLAIM OR OTHER PROCEEDING WHICH SEEKS, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, TO
CHALLENGE THE VALIDITY OR ENFORCEABILITY OF THE LOAN DOCUMENTS OR ANY PROVISION
THEREOF. THIS WAIVER SHALL APPLY TO ANY SUBSEQUENT AMENDMENTS, RENEWALS,
SUPPLEMENTS OR MODIFICATIONS TO THE LOAN DOCUMENTS.

          11.16 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, together with the other Loan
Documents, embodies the entire agreement and understanding among the Company,
the Banks and the Administrative Agent, and supersedes all prior or

understandings of such Persons, verbal or written, relating to the subject
