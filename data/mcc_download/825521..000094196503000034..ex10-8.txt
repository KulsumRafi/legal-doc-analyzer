RE: extension of deadline to exercise options

Dear ______________,

     This letter hereby amends that certain Letter Agreement dated June 21, 2001
(a copy of which is attached  hereto) that set forth the  agreement  whereby you
were granted an option to purchase __________ shares of the common capital stock
of Danzer Corporation (now known as "Obsidian enterprises,  ant-") at a price of
$_______ per share (the "Option").  Pursuant to the Letter Agreement, the Option
expired on December 31, 2002. As you know, you were  prohibited  from exercising
the Option prior to its expiration on December 31, 2002 because the common stock
underlying  the Option had not been  registered on a  Registration  Statement on
Form  S-8  or  such  other   registration   statement   acceptable  to  Obsidian
Enterprises, Inc.

     Please be advised that during a meeting held on December 13, 2002 the Board
of Directors of Obsidian  Enterprises,  Inc. agreed to authorize an extension of
the  expiration  date for  exercising  the  Option to  December  31,  2003.  The
extension of the expiration  date to December 31, 2003 is only applicable to the
option issued  December 1999 for _______ common shares and is inapplicable as to
any other options set forth in the Letter Agreement.

     By your signature  hereto,  you hereby  acknowledge  receipt of this notice
extending  the  expiration  date for the Option  and also  ratify,  confirm  and
reaffirm in all respects  all terms,  conditions,  representations,  warranties,
obligations and  restrictions set for in the Letter  Agreement,  unless same are
specifically amended herein.


                                            Yours truly,

                                            /s/ Timothy S. Durham
                                            Timothy S. Durham
                                            Chairman of the Board
