<P><FONT SIZE=2>Mr.&nbsp;Matthew Hayden<BR>
President<BR>
Hayden Communications,&nbsp;Inc.<BR>
1401 Havens Drive, Suite 100<BR>
North Myrtle Beach, SC 29582 </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>Dear
Mr.&nbsp;Hayden: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This
letter will serve as an agreement between AXS-One&nbsp;Inc. ("AXS-One"), and Hayden Communications,&nbsp;Inc. ("Consultant") regarding
AXS-One's retention of Consultant to provide investor relations services to AXS-One ("Services"). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consultant
will provide, in a timely and professional manner, the Services to AXS-One as are described in </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><I>Exhibit&nbsp;A</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> attached hereto and made a part hereof. In the event of a conflict between the terms of this
Agreement and the terms of </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><I>Exhibit&nbsp;A</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, this Agreement shall govern. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
content and format of all communications between Consultant and third parties relating to AXS-One must be
approved in advance by the CEO of AXS-One or such AXS-One representatives as shall be designated by such CEO from time to time during the term hereof. Consultant will ensure
that all of its employees contacting third parties relating to AXS-One will conduct themselves at all times during such contacts in a manner that will reflect favorably on
AXS-One and its products and services. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
full and complete compensation and consideration for Consultant's Services hereunder, including, except as otherwise expressly set forth
in Paragraph&nbsp;2(d) below, as full reimbursement for Consultant's expenses incurred in performing the Services, AXS-One shall (i)&nbsp;pay to Consultant a monthly service fee
("Fee") of $5,000 for each whole month during the actual term of this Agreement (Fees for partial months during the term shall be pro-rated), and (ii)&nbsp;issue to Consultant the
warrants to purchase AXS-One common stock as provided for in Paragraph&nbsp;2(b) below. Each Fee shall be invoiced by Consultant to AXS-One on the first business day of the
month for which such Fee is payable, and Fees and permitted expenses shall be paid net 45&nbsp;days following the date of AXS-One's receipt of a proper written invoice from Consultant. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
addition to the Fees provided for in Paragraph&nbsp;2(a) above, AXS-One shall, upon the expiration or
termination of the term of this Agreement, issue to Consultant warrant(s), substantially in the form of </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Exhibit&nbsp;B</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> attached hereto and made a part
hereof (collectively, the "Warrant"), to purchase the number of shares of common stock of AXS-One which is equal to the product of 10,000 shares multiplied by the number of whole months
during the actual term of this Agreement (shares for partial months during the term shall be pro-rated); but in no event shall the Warrant permit Consultant to purchase more than a total
of 120,000 shares of AXS-One common stock. The Warrant shall be 100% vested on the date of its issuance by AXS-One, as aforesaid, and shall (subject to the conditions set forth
in the Warrant) be exercisable at any time, and from time to time, during a period of three (3)&nbsp;years following the date of such issuance. The exercise price for the Warrant shall be
(i)&nbsp;for the initial up to 60,000 shares covered by the Warrant, $0.41 per share, which represents the closing price for one share of AXS-One common stock on </FONT></P>

the American Stock Exchange on October&nbsp;1, 2002 (the commencement date of the term of this Agreement), and (ii)&nbsp;for the remaining shares covered by the Warrant, if any, the closing price
for one share of AXS-One common stock on the American Stock Exchange (or, if on such date, AXS-One's common stock is not traded on the American Stock Exchange, the closing
price on the principal national stock exchange, or, if there is none, over-the-counter market or "pink sheets", upon which such common stock is then traded) on April&nbsp;1,
2003. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, in the event that during the term of this Agreement,
all, or substantially all, of the business, assets or common stock of AXS-One is acquired by a person or entity owning less than five percent (5%) of AXS-One's common stock as
of October&nbsp;1, 2002, then, promptly following the later of the date that (i)&nbsp;AXS-One signs a definitive agreement related to such acquisition, or
(ii)&nbsp;AXS-One's Board of Directors approves such acquisition, AXS-One shall, in replacement of and substitution for its obligations under Paragraph&nbsp;2(b) above,
issue to Consultant the Warrant described in Paragraph&nbsp;2(b) above for 120,000 shares of common stock, which Warrant shall be 100% vested on the date of such issuance; it being the intent of the
parties that Consultant shall have the opportunity to exercise such Warrant and exchange the resulting shares of common stock for the consideration provided for in the acquisition. If the Warrant is
issued under this Paragraph&nbsp;2(c) on or prior to April&nbsp;1, 2003, then the exercise price for all of the shares covered by the Warrant shall be $0.41 per share; otherwise the exercise price
rules of Paragraph&nbsp;2(b) above shall apply. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AXS-One
shall reimburse Consultant for any reasonable and necessary (i)&nbsp;out-of-town
travel (transportation, lodging and meal) expenses incurred by Consultant's employees, at the express request of AXS-One, during the performance of the Services, in accordance with the
terms and conditions of AXS-One's policies therefor (including documentation requirements) for AXS-One's own employees, and (ii)&nbsp;documented fees paid by Consultant to
third parties (e.g., postage for investor packages or research reports, news wire service fees, fax-broadcasting news release fees, photocopying/printing fees) in connection with the
Services, at Consultant's actual costs therefor; provided, however, that such third party fees must be approved by AXS-One in writing in advance of being incurred if such fees will exceed
$500 in any single instance. AXS-One may pre-approve in writing reimbursement of reasonable and necessary expenses for other extraordinary items such as broker lunch
presentations or media campaigns. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
term of this Agreement shall commence on October&nbsp;1, 2002 and expire as of September&nbsp;30, 2003, unless earlier terminated
by either party, solely as a result of a material breach of this Agreement by the other party, which breach remains uncured for a period of thirty (30)&nbsp;days following the breaching party's
receipt of a written notice from the other party setting forth such breach and demanding its cure. Any such termination by AXS-One as a result of an uncured material breach by Consultant
prior to expiration shall immediately relieve AXS-One of any further obligation to pay any then unpaid Fees or issue warrants to purchase unearned shares pursuant to Paragraph&nbsp;2
above. Any such termination by Consultant as a result of an uncured material breach by AXS-One prior to expiration shall not relieve AXS-One of the obligation to pay any Fees,
or issue warrants to purchase shares pursuant to Paragraph&nbsp;2 above for the entire term of the Agreement. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon
the expiration or any earlier termination of this Agreement, Consultant shall immediately turn over to AXS-One
all materials belonging to AXS-One, including, without limitation, any and all materials created for AXS-One under this Agreement. Consultant shall not retain any copies of the
foregoing materials. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It
is understood and agreed that Consultant is, and shall remain, an independent contractor. Consultant acknowledges and agrees that it shall be solely
Consultant's obligation to report to taxation and similar authorities all compensation received by Consultant pursuant to this Agreement and to pay all taxes or
impositions thereon, and Consultant agrees to indemnify AXS-One and to hold it harmless to the extent of any obligation imposed against AXS-One to pay any withholding taxes,
social security, unemployment or disability insurance, or similar items in connection with any payments made to </FONT></P>

the expiration or termination of this Agreement, without the prior written consent of the AXS-One's CEO or CFO. Consultant further agrees to take all action necessary to protect the
confidentiality of the Confidential Information, and to prevent the unauthorized use or copying of the Confidential Information, which comes into Consultant's possession. Upon AXS-One's
request or the expiration or termination of this Agreement, Consultant shall return all written, recorded or machine readable Confidential Information to AXS-One. Consultant's obligations
under this paragraph shall survive indefinitely the expiration or termination of this Agreement. </FONT></P>

consolidation of the Company with or the merger of the Company with or into any other Person or in case of the sale, lease or other transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company to
any other Person, this Warrant shall, after such capital reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, lease or other transfer, be convertible into the number of shares of stock or
other securities or property to which the Common Stock issuable (at the time of such capital reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, lease or other transfer) upon exercise of
this Warrant would have been entitled upon such capital reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, lease or other transfer; and in any such case, if necessary, the provisions set
forth herein with respect to the rights and interests thereafter of the Holder shall be appropriately adjusted so as to be applicable, as nearly as may reasonably be, to any shares of stock or other
securities or property thereafter deliverable on the exercise of this Warrant. The subdivision or combination of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of this Warrant at any time outstanding
into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock of the Company (whether with or without par value) shall not be deemed to be a reclassification of the Common Stock of the Company for the
purposes of this clause&nbsp;(iii). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Rounding
of Calculations; Minimum Adjustment</U>. All calculations under this Article&nbsp;IV shall be made to the nearest cent or to the
nearest one-hundredth of a share, as the case may be. Any provision of this Article&nbsp;IV to the contrary notwithstanding, no adjustment to the Exercise Price shall be made if the
amount of such adjustment would be less than $.01, but any such amount shall be carried forward and an adjustment with respect thereto shall be made at the time of and together with any subsequent
adjustment which, together with such amount and any other amount or amounts so carried forward, shall aggregate $.01 or more. </FONT></P>

<UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Statement
Regarding Adjustments</U>. Whenever any adjustments shall be required as provided in Section&nbsp;4.1(a), the Company shall
forthwith file, at the Warrant Office and, if different, at the principal office of the Company, a statement showing in detail such adjustments and the facts requiring such adjustment, which statement
shall also be sent to the Holder. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Costs</U>.
The Company shall pay all documentary, stamp, transfer or other transactional taxes attributable to the issuance or delivery of
shares of Common Stock of the Company upon exercise of this Warrant. The Holder shall pay all documentary, stamp, transfer or other transactional taxes attributable to any transfer of this Warrant or
of the Warrant Shares. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Reservation
of Shares</U>. The Company shall reserve at all times so long as this Warrant remains outstanding, free from preemptive rights, out
of its treasury stock or its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock, or both, solely for the purpose of effecting the exercise of this Warrant, sufficient shares of Common Stock to provide for
the exercise of this Warrant. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Exchange
Act</U>. The Company shall comply with the reporting requirements of Sections 13 and 15(d) of the Exchange Act for so long as and to
the extent that such requirements apply to the Company. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Valid
Issuance</U>. All shares of Common Stock which may be issued upon exercise of this Warrant will upon issuance by the Company be duly and
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and free from all taxes, liens and charges with respect to the issuance thereof and the Company shall take no action which will cause a contrary result
(including, without limitation, any action which would cause the Exercise Price to be less than the par value of the Common Stock). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Entire Agreement</U>. This Warrant contains the entire agreement between the Holder and the Company with respect to the
purchase of the Warrant Shares and the related transactions and supersedes all prior arrangements or understandings with respect thereto. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Governing
Law</U>. This Warrant shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to
the conflict of laws. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Waiver
and Amendment</U>. At any time, any term or provision of this Warrant may be waived, amended or supplemented only by a writing signed by
the Holder and the Company. A waiver by the Company or the Holder of a breach of any provision of this Warrant shall not operate as or be construed to be a waiver of any other breach of such provision
or of any other provision of this Warrant. The failure of the Holder or the Company to insist upon strict adherence to any term of this Agreement on one or more occasions shall not be considered a
waiver or deprive that party of the right thereafter to insist on strict adherence to that term or any other term of this Agreement. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Assignment
by the Company</U>. The Company may not sell, assign, transfer or otherwise convey any of its rights or delegate any of its duties
under this Warrant except to a corporation succeeding to the Company by merger, consolidation or acquisition of all or substantially all of the Company's business and/or assets, and this Warrant shall
be binding on and inure to the benefit of such successor. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Separability</U>.
If any provision in this Warrant shall be determined to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect for any reason,
the validity, legality and enforceability of any such provision in any other respect and of the remaining provisions of this Warrant in any respect shall not be in any way impaired. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Notice</U>.
Any notice or other communication required or permitted to be given or delivered hereunder shall be in writing and; if to the
Holder, shall be delivered at, or sent by reputable "overnight" courier to, such Holder at the last address shown on the books of the Company maintained at the Warrant Office or at any more recent
address of which any Holder shall have notified the Company in writing; and if to the Company, shall be delivered at, or sent by reputable "overnight" courier to, the General Counsel of the Company at
301 Route 17 North, Rutherford, NJ 07070, or such other address within the United States of America as shall have been furnished by the Company to the Holder. Any notice or other communication
hereunder shall be deemed given at the time of receipt thereof. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Limitation
of Liability; Not Stockholders</U>. No provisions of this Warrant shall be construed as conferring upon the Holder the right to vote,
consent, receive dividends, or receive notice other than as herein expressly provided, in respect of meetings of stockholders for the election of directors of the Company or any other matter
whatsoever as a stockholder of the Company. No provision hereof, in the absence of affirmative action taken by the Holder to exercise this Warrant and thereby purchase shares of Common Stock, and no
mere enumeration herein of the rights or privileges of the Holder hereof, shall give rise to any liability of the Holder for the purchase price of any Warrant Shares or as a stockholder of the
Company, whether such liability is asserted by the Company or by creditors of the Company. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Loss,
Destruction, Etc. of Warrant</U>. Upon receipt of evidence satisfactory to the Company of the loss, theft, mutilation or destruction of
this Warrant, and in the case of any loss, theft or destruction, upon delivery of a bond indemnity in such form and amount as shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Company, or in the event of such
mutilation upon surrender and cancellation of this Warrant, the Company will make and deliver a new Warrant, of like tenor, in replacement of and substitution for such lost, stolen, destroyed or
mutilated Warrant (which shall thereupon become null and void and of no further effect). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)
If the Company at any time prior to the first anniversary of the Expiration Date (at which time the rights granted under this Section&nbsp;2 shall expire) proposes to register any
of its Common Stock under the Act on any form other than Form&nbsp;S-4 or Form&nbsp;S-8 (or any similar or successor form then in effect),
whether or not for sale for its own account, and if the registration form proposed to be used may be used for the registration of the Warrant Shares, then the Company will give prompt written notice
to the Holder of its intention to do so, such notice to specify the proposed numbers of shares to be registered thereby and the date, not less than 10&nbsp;days thereafter, by which the Company must
receive the Holder's written indication of whether the Holder wishes to include its Warrant Shares in such registration statement. Upon the written request of the Holder made on or before the date
specified in such notice (which request shall specify the number of Warrant Shares intended to be disposed of by the Holder), the Company will, to the extent permitted under Section&nbsp;7, use all
commercially reasonable efforts to cause all such Warrant Shares, which the Holder has so requested the registration thereof, to be registered under the Act (with the other shares that the Company at
the time proposes to register), to the extent requisite to permit the sale or other disposition by the Holder of the Warrant Shares to be so registered. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section&nbsp;2, the Company shall have the right to discontinue any registration under this Section&nbsp;2 at any time prior to
the effective date of such registration if the registration of other shares of Common Stock giving rise to such registration under this Section&nbsp;2 is discontinued. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)
The obligations of the Company under Section&nbsp;2(a) hereof shall terminate (a)&nbsp;if the Holder rejects the opportunity to participate in a registration with respect to
which Holder's Warrant Shares would have been included but for said rejection by the Holder and such registration has been declared or ordered effective, or (b)&nbsp;the first registration by
Company, including any of Holder's Warrant Shares, has been declared or ordered effective. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)
prepare and file with the Commission a registration statement with respect to such Common Stock to be registered (including the Warrant Shares to be registered) and use all
commercially reasonable efforts to cause such registration statement to become and remain effective for a period of at least 180&nbsp;days (or such shorter period if all Common Stock so registered
have been sold); provided that, before filing a registration statement or prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto, the Company will furnish to the Holder for review copies of all such
documents proposed to be filed; </FONT></P>

connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability, expense, action or proceeding; provided, however, that the Company shall not be liable to any such Holder
Indemnified Party insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities, expenses, actions or proceedings are the result of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement made in reliance on or in
conformity with any information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any Holder Indemnified Party, or any omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relating to any information

of such claim, with reputable and experienced counsel; and if such defense is so assumed, such indemnified party shall not enter into any settlement without the consent of the indemnifying party if
such settlement attributes liability to the indemnifying party and such indemnifying party shall not be subject to any liability for any settlement made without its consent (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld); and (iii)&nbsp;provide such reasonably requested assistance to the indemnifying party, at the indemnifying party's expense. Such indemnity shall remain in full force and

misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section&nbsp;11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. </FONT></P>
