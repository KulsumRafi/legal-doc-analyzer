paid by the Indenture Trustee from the Funding Account by combining such Cash
Purchase Price with the related Seller Contribution and paying the aggregate
amount of such P&I Advances to the appropriate REMIC Trustee on behalf of and at
the direction of the Seller. Notwithstanding the failure of the Indenture
Trustee to pay the Cash Purchase Price of any of the Additional Receivables, due

Advances, into the Funding Account and shall contribute such Additional
Receivables to the Issuer on the related Funding Date.

                      (c)  On the Closing Date, the Seller shall deliver to the

representations and warranties shall survive the sale and/or contribution of any
Aggregate Receivables to the Issuer and are as follows:

company duly formed and validly existing in good standing in the jurisdiction of
its formation and is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing in
each jurisdiction in which such qualification is necessary, except where the
failure to be so qualified or in good standing would not reasonably be expected
to have a material adverse effect on (a) the business, operations, properties or
condition (financial or otherwise) of (i) the Seller or (ii) the Seller and its
Affiliates taken as a whole or (b) the validity or enforceability of this
Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents or the rights or remedies of
the Issuer or the Indenture Trustee hereunder or thereunder or (c) the ability
of the Seller to perform its obligations under this Agreement or (d) the
enforceability or recoverability of any of the Aggregate Receivables (a
"Material Adverse Effect").

                      (b)  Power and Authority. The Seller has all requisite
power and authority and has all material governmental licenses, authorizations,
consents and approvals necessary to execute and deliver and perform its
obligations under this Agreement and any other Transaction Document to which it
is a party and, except to the extent not necessary in order to execute and
deliver and perform its obligations under this Agreement and any other

business as now being conducted.

                      (c)  Authorization of Borrowing. All appropriate and
necessary action has been taken by the Seller to authorize the execution and

party, and to authorize the performance and observance of the terms hereof and
thereof.

                      (d)  Agreement Binding. This Agreement and each of the
other Transaction Documents to which the Seller is a party constitute the legal,
valid and binding obligation of the Seller enforceable in accordance with their
terms except as may be limited by laws governing insolvency or creditors' rights
or by rules of equity. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement
and the other Transaction Documents to which the Seller is a party will not
violate any provision of law, regulation,

                                       7

order or other governmental directive, or conflict with, constitute a default
under, or result in the breach of any provision of any agreement, ordinance,
decree, bond, indenture, order or judgment to which the Seller is a party or by
which it or its properties is or are bound.

                      (e)  Advance Facility. With respect to each of the REMIC
Trusts, (i) the Notes and the transactions under the Indenture and the other
Transaction Documents constitute an "Advance Facility" under the related REMIC
Pooling Agreement; (ii) the Indenture Trustee is the "Advance Financing Person"

                      (f)  Compliance with Law. The Seller is conducting its
business and operations in compliance with all applicable laws, regulations,
ordinances and directives of governmental authorities. The Seller has filed all
tax returns required to be filed and has paid all taxes in respect of the
ownership of its assets or the conduct of its operations prior to the date after
which penalties attach for failure to pay except to the extent that the payment
of such taxes is being contested in good faith by it in appropriate proceedings
and adequate reserves have been provided for the payment thereof.

                      (g)  Consents. All licenses, consents and approvals

governmental or other public body or authority for the making and performance by

a party have been obtained and are in effect.

                      (h)  Litigation. There is no action, suit or proceeding at
law or in equity by or before any court, governmental agency or authority or

of record) by

                                       8

the Seller. Such membership interests are fully paid and nonassessable and no
one other than the Seller has any rights to acquire membership interests in the

                      (l)  Solvency. The Seller, both prior to and after giving
effect to each sale and/or contribution of Aggregate Receivables on the Closing

furnished by or on behalf of the Seller or the REMIC Servicer, in writing
pursuant to this Agreement, any other Transaction Document or in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby contains or will contain when
furnished any untrue statement of a material fact. There are no facts relating
to, and known by the Seller which when taken as a whole, materially adversely
affect the financial condition or assets or business of the Seller, or which may
impair the ability of the Seller or the REMIC Servicer to perform its
obligations under this Agreement or any other Transaction Document, which have
not been disclosed herein or in the certificates and other documents furnished
by or on behalf of the Seller or the REMIC Servicer pursuant hereto or thereto
specifically for use in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or

be true, correct and complete.

assumed names or "doing business" names.

                      (r)  Repayment of Receivables. The Seller has no reason to
believe that at the time of the sale and/or contribution of the Aggregate
Receivables to the Issuer pursuant hereto, the Aggregate Receivables will not be
paid in full.

                      (s)  Aggregate Receivables.

                                    pursuant to and in accordance with the terms
                                    of the related REMIC Pooling Agreement and
                                    with the customary procedures and in the
                                    ordinary course of business of the Seller
                                    and is being sold and/or contributed by the
                                    Seller to the Issuer hereunder.

                         (ii)       The rights to reimbursement for the P&I
                                    Advances under each REMIC Trust are, and
                                    each Aggregate Receivable is, eligible for
                                    sale and contribution to the Issuer, and for
                                    assignment and Grant to the Indenture
                                    Trustee, as part of the Trust Estate,
                                    pursuant to the Indenture, and such sale to
                                    the Issuer, and such assignment and Grant to
                                    the Trust Estate, will not violate the terms
                                    of the related REMIC Pooling Agreement or
                                    any other document or agreements to which
                                    the Seller is a party or to which its assets
                                    or properties are subject.

                         (iii)      No Receivable has been sold, transferred,
                                    assigned or pledged by the Seller to any
                                    Person other than the Issuer. Immediately
                                    prior to the transfer and assignment herein
                                    contemplated, the Seller had good and
                                    marketable title to each Initial Receivable
                                    and Additional Receivable, free and clear of
                                    all Liens and rights of others; immediately
                                    upon the transfer and assignment thereof,
                                    the Issuer shall have good and marketable
                                    title to each Initial Receivable and
                                    Additional Receivable, free and clear of all
                                    Liens and rights of others (other than the
                                    Lien created by the Indenture).

                         (iv)       As of the date of conveyance with respect to
                                    the Initial Receivables and Additional
                                    Receivables transferred on such date, the
                                    Seller has not taken any action that, or
                                    failed to take any action the omission of
                                    which, would materially impair the rights of
                                    the Issuer (or any Secured Party) with
                                    respect to any such Receivable.

                         (v)        As of the date of conveyance with respect to
                                    the Initial Receivables and Additional
                                    Receivables transferred on such date, no
                                    such Receivable has been identified by the
                                    Seller or reported to the Seller by the
                                    related REMIC Trustee as having resulted
                                    from fraud perpetrated by any Person with
                                    respect to the related account.

                         (vi)       All filings (including UCC filings)

                                    third parties with notice of the transfer
                                    and assignment herein contemplated, and
                                    solely in the event the transfer
                                    contemplated hereby were to be
                                    recharacterized as a pledge rather than an
                                    absolute sale, to give the Issuer a security
                                    interest in the Aggregate Receivables that
                                    is prior to any other interest held or to be

                                       10

                                    held by any other Person (except the
                                    Indenture Trustee on behalf of the Secured
                                    Parties) has been made.

                         (vii)      No Aggregate Receivable is secured by "real
                                    property" or "fixtures" or evidenced by an
                                    "instrument" under and as defined in the
                                    Relevant UCC.

                         (viii)     Each Initial Receivable and Additional
                                    Receivable is the legal, valid and binding
                                    obligation of the related REMIC Trust and is
                                    enforceable in accordance with its terms.
                                    There is no valid and enforceable offset,
                                    defense or counterclaim to the obligation of
                                    the related REMIC Trust to make payment of
                                    any such Receivable.

                         (ix)       Each Initial Receivable and Additional
                                    Receivable is entitled to be paid, has not
                                    been repaid in whole or been compromised,
                                    adjusted (except by partial payment),
                                    extended, satisfied, subordinated,
                                    rescinded, amended or modified, and is not
                                    subject to compromise, adjustment,
                                    extension, satisfaction, subordination,

                         (x)        As of the date of conveyance with respect to
                                    the Initial Receivables and Additional
                                    Receivables transferred on such date, such

                                    as a result of accounting or other errors,
                                    or the failure to deposit funds or the
                                    misapplication of funds by the REMIC
                                    Servicer.

                         (xi)       As of the date of conveyance with respect to
                                    the Initial Receivables and any Additional
                                    Receivables transferred on such date, no
                                    such Receivable has been identified by the
                                    Seller as a Non-Recoverable Advance (as
                                    defined in the REMIC Pooling Agreements) for
                                    which reimbursement has not been sought from
                                    the REMIC Trust in accordance with the
                                    related REMIC Pooling Agreement.

                         (xii)      Except for any Receivables related to
                                    Existing P&I Advances that have been
                                    conveyed to the Tranche A SPE, the Initial
                                    Receivables represent all of the rights to
                                    be reimbursed for all P&I Advances with
                                    respect to the REMIC Trusts as of the
                                    Closing Date. The Seller has not sold,
                                    assigned, transferred or conveyed any P&I
                                    Advance with respect to the REMIC Trusts to
                                    any Person other than the Issuer and the
                                    Tranche A SPE. The Additional Receivables
                                    conveyed on any Funding Date constitute all
                                    of the P&I Advances with respect to the
                                    REMIC Trusts not previously sold and/or
                                    contributed to the Issuer hereunder, except

applicable) and the Indenture Trustee promptly, in writing, upon the discovery
of any breach of the Seller's representations and warranties hereunder that
pertain to a Receivable. Unless such breach shall have been cured or waived
within thirty (30) days after the earlier to occur of the discovery of such
breach by the Issuer or the Seller (as applicable) or receipt of written notice
of such breach by the Issuer or the Seller (as applicable), the Seller shall
repurchase such Receivable from the Issuer at a price equal to the outstanding
Receivable Balance of such Receivable as of the date of repurchase (the
"Repurchase Price"). The Seller shall pay any Repurchase Price directly to the
Indenture Trustee for deposit into the Reimbursement Account.

                                   ARTICLE VI.
                   INTENTION OF THE PARTIES; SECURITY INTEREST

                  Section 6.01.     Intention of the Parties. It is the
intention of the parties hereto that each transfer and assignment contemplated
by this Agreement shall constitute an absolute sale and contribution of the
related Receivables from the Seller to the Issuer and that the related
Receivables shall not be part of the Seller's estate or otherwise be considered
property of the Seller in the event of the bankruptcy, receivership, insolvency,
liquidation, conservatorship or similar proceeding relating to the Seller or any
of its property. Except as set forth below, it is not intended that any amounts
available for reimbursement of Receivables be deemed to have been pledged by the
Seller to the Issuer or the Indenture Trustee to secure a debt or other
obligation of the Seller. In the event that (A) the purchase of Receivables by
the Issuer is deemed by a court or applicable regulatory, administrative or
other governmental body contrary to the express intent of the parties to
constitute a pledge rather than a sale and contribution of the Receivables or
(B) if amounts available now or in the future for reimbursement of any Aggregate
Receivables are held to be property of the Seller or a loan to the Seller, or
(C) if for any reason this Agreement is held or deemed to be a financing or some
other similar arrangement or agreement, then (i) this Agreement is and shall be
a security agreement within the meaning of Articles 8 and 9 of the Relevant UCC;
(ii) the Issuer shall be treated as having a first priority, perfected security
interest in and to, and lien on, the Receivables transferred and assigned to the
Issuer hereunder; (iii) the agreement of the Seller hereunder to sell, assign,
convey and transfer the Receivables shall be a grant by the Seller to the Issuer
of a security interest in all of the Seller's right (including the power to
convey title thereto), title, and interest, whether now owned or hereafter
acquired, in and to (A) all amounts reimbursable now or in the future by or with
respect to the Receivables and (B) any and all general intangibles consisting
of, arising from or relating to any of the foregoing, and all proceeds of the
conversion, voluntary or involuntary, of the foregoing into cash, instruments,
securities or other property, including without limitation all such amounts from
time to time held or invested in accounts maintained by or on behalf of the
Seller or by or on behalf of the REMIC

                                       12
<PAGE>
Trusts, whether in the form of cash, instruments, securities or other property.
The possession by the Issuer or its agent of notes and such other goods, money,
documents or such other items of property as constitute instruments, money,
negotiable documents or chattel paper, and the filing of Form UCC-1, shall be
"possession by the secured party," or possession by a purchaser or a person
designated by such secured party, for purposes of perfecting the security
interest pursuant to the Relevant UCC of any applicable jurisdiction; and
notifications to persons holding such property, and acknowledgments, receipts or
confirmations from persons holding such property, shall be notifications to, or
acknowledgments, receipts or confirmations from, financial intermediaries,
bailees or agents (as applicable) of any such holder for the purpose of
perfecting such security interest under applicable law.

                  Section 6.02.     Security Interest. The Seller shall, to the
extent consistent with this Agreement, take such actions as may be necessary to
ensure that, if this Agreement were deemed to create a security interest in (i)
any of the Aggregate Receivables, (ii) the amounts reimbursable now or in the
future by or with respect to the REMIC Trusts in respect of any of the Aggregate
Receivables or (iii) the other property described above, such security interest
would be a perfected security interest of first priority under applicable law
and will be maintained as such throughout the term of this Agreement. At the
Issuer's direction, the Seller shall execute such documents and instruments as
the Issuer may reasonably request from time to time in order to effectuate the
foregoing and shall return to the Issuer the executed copy of such documents and
instruments. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Seller shall
forward for filing, or shall cause to be forwarded for filing, at the expense of
the Seller, all filings necessary to maintain the effectiveness of any original
filings necessary under the Relevant UCC to perfect the Issuer's security
interest described above, including without limitation (x) UCC continuation
statements, and (y) such other statements as may be occasioned by (1) any change
of name of the Seller or the Issuer (such preparation and filing shall be at the
expense of the Issuer, if occasioned by a change in such party's name) or (2)
any change of location of the jurisdiction of organization of the Seller.

                                  ARTICLE VII.

manner that does not unreasonably interfere with the Seller's conduct of its
business:

                      (a)  examine all books, records and documents (including

the Indenture Trustee pursuant to the Indenture.

                  The Seller agrees to take any and all acts and to execute any

Indenture Trustee, the Agent or the Secured Parties to more fully effect the
purposes of this Agreement.

                  Section 7.04.     Covenants. The Seller shall duly observe and
perform each of its covenants set forth in each of the Transaction Documents to
which it is a party. The Seller shall duly observe and perform all of the
covenants and obligations of the Seller and the REMIC Servicer set forth in the
Indenture as if the Seller was a party thereto. The Seller in its capacity as
REMIC Servicer shall duly observe and perform each of its covenants set forth in
the REMIC Pooling Agreements.

                  Section 7.05.     Extension Advances. The Seller as REMIC
Servicer shall not make any extension advances unless such extension advance
will bring the related asset current.

                  Section 7.05.     Amendments. The Seller shall not make, or
permit any Person to make, any amendment, modification or change to, or provide
any waiver under any Transaction Document to which the Seller is a party without
the prior written consent of Noteholders with an aggregate Note Principal
Balance of not less than 66 2/3% of the aggregate Note Principal Balance of the
Outstanding Notes (the "Required Noteholders").

<PAGE>
                  Section 8.07.     Compliance With Laws. The Seller shall

adequate reserves with respect to any such tax, assessment, charge or levy so
contested, or so long as the failure to pay any such tax, assessment, charge or
levy would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse
Effect.

Property. The Seller hereby covenants and agrees not to create or suffer to

with respect to any of its interest in any Account, or assign any right to
receive income in respect thereof, except for the Lien created by the Indenture.
The Seller shall immediately notify the Indenture Trustee of the existence of
any Lien on any of the Aggregate Receivables and the Seller shall defend the
right, title and interest of each of the Issuer and the Indenture Trustee in, to
and under the Aggregate Receivables, against all claims of third parties.

sufficient detail to permit the reader thereof to know at any time the status of

owing (and the nature of each, if applicable). The Seller shall maintain its
computer records so that, from and after the time of the granting of the
security interest under the Indenture on the Receivables to the Indenture
Trustee, the Seller's master computer records (including any back-up archives)
that refer to any Receivables indicate clearly the interest of the Issuer in
such Receivables and that the Receivable is owned by the Issuer and pledged to
the Indenture Trustee on behalf of the Secured Parties.

                  Section 8.14.     Verification Agent. The Seller shall
cooperate with the Verification Agent and shall allow the Verification Agent

Existing P&I Advances contributed to the Tranche A SPE, the Initial Receivables

SPE). The Additional Receivables sold and/or contributed on each Funding Date
shall consist of all of the P&I Advances with respect to the REMIC Trusts not

                                 INDEMNIFICATION

                  Section 9.01.     Indemnification.

                      (a)  Without limiting any other rights that an Indemnified
Party may have hereunder or under applicable law, the Seller hereby agrees to
indemnify each

                                       17
<PAGE>
Indemnified Party (as defined below) from and against any and all Indemnified
Amounts (as defined below) which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted
against an Indemnified Party in any way arising out of or relating to any breach
of the Seller's or the REMIC Servicer's obligations under this Agreement or any
other Transaction Document, or the ownership of the Aggregate Receivables or in
respect of any Aggregate Receivables, excluding, however, Indemnified Amounts to
the extent resulting from gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of
such Indemnified Party.

                  Without limiting or being limited by the foregoing, the Seller
shall pay on demand to each Indemnified Party any and all amounts necessary to
indemnify such Indemnified Party from and against any and all Indemnified
Amounts relating to or resulting from:

                           (i)      a breach of any representation or warranty
                                    made by the Seller under or in connection
                                    with this Agreement;

                           (ii)     the failure by the Seller or the REMIC
                                    Servicer to comply with any term, provision
                                    or covenant contained in this Agreement, or
                                    any agreement executed by it in connection
                                    with this Agreement or with any applicable
                                    law, rule or regulation with respect to any
                                    Aggregate Receivable, or the nonconformity
                                    of any Aggregate Receivable with any such
                                    applicable law, rule or regulation; or

                           (iii)    the failure to vest and maintain vested in
                                    the Issuer, or to transfer, to the Issuer,
                                    legal and equitable title to and ownership
                                    of the Aggregate Receivables, together with
                                    all collections in respect thereof, free and
                                    clear of any adverse claim (except as
                                    permitted hereunder) whether existing at the
                                    time of the transfer of such Aggregate
                                    Receivable or at any time thereafter.

                      (b)  Any Indemnified Amounts subject to the
indemnification provisions of this Section 9.01 shall be paid to the Indemnified
Party within 20 Business Days following demand therefor. "Indemnified Party"
means any of the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee, the Agent and the Secured
Parties and their officers, employees, directors and successors or assigns.
"Indemnified Amounts" means any and all claims, losses, liabilities,
obligations, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, and related
reasonable costs and reasonable expenses of any nature whatsoever, including
reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements (subject to the following
paragraph), incurred by an Indemnified Party with respect to this Agreement.

                      (c)  Promptly after an Indemnified Party shall have been
served with the summons or other first legal process or shall have received
written notice of the threat of a claim in respect of which an indemnity may be
claimed against the Seller under this Section 9.01, the Indemnified Party shall
notify the Seller in writing of the service of such summons, other legal process
or written notice, giving information therein as to the nature and basis of the
claim, but failure so to notify the Seller shall not relieve the Seller from any
liability which it may have hereunder or otherwise except to the extent that the

                                       18
<PAGE>
Seller is prejudiced by such failure so to notify the Seller. The Seller will be
entitled, at its own expense, to participate in the defense of any such claim or
action and to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory
to such Indemnified Party, unless the defendants in any such action include both
the Indemnified Party and the Seller, and the Indemnified Party (upon the advice
of counsel) shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses
available to it that are different from or additional to those available to the
Seller, or one or more Indemnified Parties, and which in the reasonable opinion
of such counsel are sufficient to create a conflict of interest for the same
counsel to represent both the Seller and such Indemnified Party; provided,
however, that the Seller shall not be responsible for the fees and expenses of
more than one firm of attorneys for all Indemnified Parties related to the
Issuer, one firm of attorneys for all Indemnified Parties related to the Secured
Parties and one firm of attorneys for the Indenture Trustee. Each Indemnified
Party shall cooperate with the Seller in the defense of any such action or
claim. The Seller shall not, without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding
in respect of which any Indemnified Party is or could have been a party and
indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Party, unless
such settlement includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from
all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding or
threatened proceeding.

and communications shall be deemed effective upon receipt thereof, and in the
case of telecopies, when receipt is confirmed by telephone.

                  Section 10.03.    No Waiver; Remedies. No failure on the part
of any party hereto to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right hereunder
shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of
any right hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right. The remedies herein provided are cumulative and not
exclusive of any remedies provided by law.

                      (a)  This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the Seller and the Issuer and their respective permitted successors
and assigns; provided, however, the Seller shall not have any right to assign

otherwise) without the prior written consent of the Issuer and the Required
Noteholders.

continuing obligation of the parties hereto in accordance with its terms, and
