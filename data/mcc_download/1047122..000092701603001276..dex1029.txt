     364-DAY COMPETITIVE ADVANCE AND REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, dated as of
November 25, 2002, among RAYTHEON COMPANY, a Delaware corporation (the
"Borrower"), RAYTHEON TECHNICAL SERVICES COMPANY, a Delaware corporation, and
RAYTHEON AIRCRAFT COMPANY, a Kansas corporation, each as a Guarantor (in such
capacity, each a "Guarantor" and, collectively, the "Guarantors"), the Lenders
(as defined in Article I), J.P. MORGAN SECURITIES INC. and BANC OF AMERICA
SECURITIES LLC, as joint lead arrangers and joint bookrunners (in such capacity,
the "Arrangers"), BANK OF AMERICA, N.A., as syndication agent (in such capacity,
the "Syndication Agent"), CITICORP USA, INC. and CREDIT SUISSE FIRST BOSTON, as
documentation agents (in such capacity, each a "Documentation Agent" and,
collectively, the "Documentation Agents"), and JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, a New York
banking corporation, as administrative agent (in such capacity, the
"Administrative Agent", and, collectively with the Syndication Agent, the
"Agents") for the Lenders.

     The Borrower has requested the Lenders, and the Lenders have agreed, to
extend credit in the form of Revolving Loans at any time and from time to time
prior to the Maturity Date, in an aggregate principal amount at any time
outstanding not in excess of $1,550,000,000. The Borrower also has requested the
Lenders to provide a procedure pursuant to which the Borrower may invite the
Lenders to bid on an uncommitted basis on short-term borrowings by the Borrower.
The proceeds of the Loans are to be used by the Borrower for working capital and
general corporate purposes of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries.

     The Lenders are willing to extend such credit to the Borrower on the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth herein. Accordingly, the parties hereto
agree as follows:

                                    ARTICLE I

                                   Definitions

     SECTION 1.01.   Defined Terms. As used in this Agreement, the following
terms shall have the meanings specified below:

     "ABR Borrowing" shall mean a Borrowing comprised of ABR Loans.

     "ABR Loan" shall mean any Loan bearing interest at the Alternate Base Rate
in accordance with the provisions of Article II.

     "Administrative Questionnaire" shall mean an Administrative Questionnaire
in the form of Exhibit A.

     "Affiliate" shall mean, when used with respect to a specified person,
another person that directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediaries,
Controls or is Controlled by or is under common Control with the person
specified.

     "Agents" shall have the meaning assigned to such term in the preamble.

     "Agents' Fees" shall have the meaning assigned to such term in
Section 2.06(c).

     "Aggregate Revolving Credit Exposure" shall mean the aggregate amount of
the Lenders' Revolving Credit Exposures.

<PAGE>

                                                                               2

     "Agreement" shall mean this 364-Day Competitive Advance and Revolving
Credit Facility, as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to
time.

     "Alternate Base Rate" shall mean, for any day, a rate per annum (rounded
upwards, if necessary, to the next 1/100 of 1%) equal to the greatest of (a) the
Prime Rate in effect on such day, (b) the Base CD Rate in effect on such day
plus 1% and (c) the Federal Funds Effective Rate in effect on such day plus 1/2
of 1%. If for any reason the Administrative Agent shall have determined (which
determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that it is unable to
ascertain the Base CD Rate or the Federal Funds Effective Rate or both for any
reason, including the inability or failure of the Administrative Agent to obtain
sufficient quotations in accordance with the terms hereof, the Alternate Base
Rate shall be determined without regard to clause (b) or (c), or both, of the
preceding sentence, as appropriate, until the circumstances giving rise to such
inability no longer exist. Any change in the Alternate Base Rate due to a change
in the Prime Rate, the Base CD Rate or the Federal Funds Effective Rate shall be
effective on the effective date of such change in the Prime Rate, the Base CD
Rate or the Federal Funds Effective Rate, respectively.

     "Applicable Percentage" shall mean, with respect to any Eurodollar Loan
(other than any Eurodollar Competitive Loan), with respect to any ABR Loan or
with respect to the Facility Fees, as the case may be, with respect to the day
of, and any day after, the Closing Date, the applicable percentage set forth
below under the caption "Eurodollar Spread", "ABR Spread" or "Fee Percentage",
as the case may be, based upon the ratings by S&P and Moody's, respectively,
applicable on such date to the Index Debt; provided, that, after the Maturity
Date and until the six-month anniversary of the Maturity Date, the applicable
percentage (Eurodollar Spread or ABR Spread) below shall be increased by 0.500%
per annum, and after the six-month anniversary of the Maturity Date, the
applicable percentage (Eurodollar Spread or ABR Spread) below shall be increased
by 1.000% per annum:

</TABLE>

     For purposes of this definition, (i) if either Moody's or S&P shall not
have in effect a rating for the Index Debt (other than by reason of the
circumstances referred to in the last sentence of this paragraph), then such
rating agency shall be deemed to have established a rating in Category 5; (ii)
if the

ratings established or deemed to have been established by Moody's and S&P for
the Index Debt shall fall within different Categories, the Applicable Percentage
shall be based on the higher of the two ratings unless the ratings differ by
more than one category, in which case the governing rating shall be the rating
next below the higher of the two; and (iii) if the ratings established or deemed
to have been established by Moody's and S&P for the Index Debt shall be changed
(other than as a result of a change in the rating system of Moody's or S&P),
such change shall be effective as of the date on which it is first announced by
the applicable rating agency. Each change in the Applicable Percentage shall
apply during the period commencing on the effective date of such change and
ending on the date immediately preceding the effective date of the next such
change. If the rating system of Moody's or S&P shall change, or if either such
rating agency shall cease to be in the business of rating corporate debt
obligations, the Borrower and the Lenders shall negotiate in good faith to amend
this definition to reflect such changed rating system or the non-availability of
ratings from such rating agency and, pending the effectiveness of any such
amendment, the Applicable Percentage shall be determined by reference to the
rating most recently in effect prior to such change or cessation.

     "Arrangers" shall have the meaning assigned to such term in the preamble.

     "Assignment and Acceptance" shall mean an assignment and acceptance entered

Administrative Agent.

     "Base CD Rate" shall mean the sum of (a) the product of (i) the Three-Month
Secondary CD Rate and (ii) Statutory Reserves and (b) the Assessment Rate. The
term "Statutory Reserves" shall mean a fraction (expressed as a decimal), the
numerator of which is the number one and the denominator of which is the number
one minus the aggregate of the maximum reserve percentages (including any
marginal, special, emergency or supplemental reserves) expressed as a decimal
established by the Board and any other domestic banking authority to which the
Administrative Agent or any Lender (including any branch, Affiliate, or other
fronting office making or holding a Loan) is subject with respect to the Base CD
Rate, for new negotiable nonpersonal time deposits in Dollars of over $100,000
with maturities approximately equal to three months. Statutory Reserves shall be
adjusted automatically on and as of the effective date of any change in any
reserve percentage. The term "Assessment Rate" shall mean for any date the
annual rate (rounded upwards, if necessary, to the next 1/100 of 1%) most
recently estimated by the Administrative Agent as the then current net annual
assessment rate that will be employed in determining amounts payable by the
Administrative Agent to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (or any
successor) for insurance by such Corporation (or such successor) of time
deposits made in Dollars at the Administrative Agent's domestic offices.

     "Board" shall mean the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System of
the United States.

     "Borrowing" shall mean a group of Loans of a single Type made by the
Lenders (or, in the case of a Competitive Borrowing, by the Lender or Lenders
whose Competitive Bids have been accepted pursuant to Section 2.03) on a single
date and as to which a single Interest Period is in effect.

     "Borrowing Request" shall mean a request by the Borrower in accordance with
the terms of Section 2.04 and substantially in the form of Exhibit C.

     "Business" shall have the meaning assigned to such term in Section 3.17.

     "Business Day" shall mean any day other than a Saturday, Sunday or day on
which banks in New York City are authorized or required by law to close;
provided, however, that, when used in connection

<PAGE>

                                                                               4

with a Eurodollar Loan, the term "Business Day" shall also exclude any day on
which banks are not open for dealings in Dollar deposits in the London interbank
market.

     "Capital Lease Obligations" shall mean as to any person, the obligations of
such person to pay rent or other amounts under any lease of (or other
arrangement conveying the right to use) real or personal property, or a
combination thereof, which obligations are required to be classified and
accounted for as capital leases on a balance sheet of such person under GAAP
and, for the purposes of this Agreement, the amount of such obligations at any
time shall be the capitalized amount thereof at such time determined in
accordance with GAAP.

                                   ARTICLE II

                                   The Credits

     SECTION 2.01.   Commitments. Subject to the terms and conditions and
relying upon the representations and warranties herein set forth, each Lender
agrees, severally and not jointly, to make Revolving Loans to the Borrower, at
any time and from time to time on or after the Closing Date, and until the
earlier of the Maturity Date and the termination of the Commitment of such
Lender in accordance with the terms hereof, in an aggregate principal amount at
any time outstanding that will not result in (a)(i) such Lender's Revolving
Credit Exposure exceeding (ii) such Lender's Commitment or (b)(i) the aggregate
amount of outstanding Loans exceeding (ii) the Total Commitment. Within the
limits set forth in the preceding sentence, the Borrower may borrow, pay or
prepay and reborrow Revolving Loans on or after the Closing Date and prior to
the Maturity Date, subject to the terms, conditions and limitations set forth
herein.

     SECTION 2.02.   Loans. (a) Each Revolving Loan shall be made as part of a
Borrowing consisting of Loans made by the Lenders ratably in accordance with
their respective Commitments; provided, however, that the failure of any Lender
to make any Loan shall not in itself relieve any other Lender of its obligation
to lend hereunder (it being understood, however, that no Lender shall be
responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make any Loan required to be
made by such other Lender). Each Competitive Loan shall be made in accordance
with the procedures set forth in

<PAGE>

                                                                              14

Section 2.03. The Loans comprising any Borrowing shall be in an aggregate
principal amount that is (i) an integral multiple of $1,000,000 and not less
than $10,000,000 or (ii) equal to the remaining available balance of the Total
Commitment.

     (b)  Subject to Sections 2.09 and 2.14, each Competitive Borrowing shall be
comprised entirely of Eurodollar Competitive Loans or Fixed Rate Loans, and each
Revolving Credit Borrowing shall be comprised entirely of ABR Loans or
Eurodollar Loans as the Borrower may request pursuant to Section 2.03 or 2.04,
as applicable. Each Lender may at its option make any Eurodollar Loan by causing
any domestic or foreign branch or Affiliate of such Lender to make such Loan;
provided that any exercise of such option shall not affect the obligation of the
Borrower to repay such Loan in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
Borrowings of more than one Type may be outstanding at the same time; provided,
however, that the Borrower shall not be entitled to request any Borrowing that,
if made, would result in more than 15 Eurodollar Borrowings outstanding
hereunder at any time. For purposes of the foregoing, Borrowings having
different Interest Periods, regardless of whether they commence on the same
date, shall be considered separate Borrowings.

     (c)  Each Lender shall make each Loan to be made by it hereunder on the
proposed date thereof by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such
account in New York City as the Administrative Agent may designate not later
than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, and the Administrative Agent shall by 12:00
(noon), New York City time, credit the amounts so received to an account with
the Administrative Agent designated by the Borrower in the applicable Borrowing
Request or Competitive Bid Request, which account must be in the name of the
Borrower or, if a Borrowing shall not occur on such date because any condition
precedent herein specified shall not have been met, return the amounts so
received to the respective Lenders.

     (d)  Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a
Lender prior to the date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make
available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's portion of such Borrowing,
the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such portion
available to the Administrative Agent on the date of such Borrowing in
accordance with paragraph (c) above and the Administrative Agent may, in
reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower on such date a
corresponding amount. If the Administrative Agent shall have so made funds
available then, to the extent that such Lender shall not have made such portion
available to the Administrative Agent, such Lender and the Borrower severally
agree to repay to the Administrative Agent within one Business Day of demand
therefor such corresponding amount together with interest thereon, for each day
from the date such amount is made available to the Borrower until the date such
amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent at (i) in the case of the Borrower,
the interest rate applicable at the time to the Loans comprising such Borrowing
and (ii) in the case of such Lender, a rate determined by the Administrative
Agent to represent its cost of overnight or short-term funds (which
determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error). If such Lender shall
repay to the Administrative Agent such corresponding amount, such amount shall
constitute such Lender's Loan as part of such Borrowing for purposes of this
Agreement.

     (e)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Borrower
shall not be entitled to request any Borrowing if the Interest Period requested
with respect thereto would end after the Maturity Date, unless the Borrower has
given notice to extend payment of the principal amount of the Loans until the
first anniversary of the Maturity Date in accordance with subsection 2.05(a).

     SECTION 2.03.   Competitive Bid Procedure. (a) In order to request
Competitive Bids, the Borrower shall hand deliver or telecopy to the
Administrative Agent a duly completed Competitive Bid Request (i) in the case of
a Eurodollar Competitive Borrowing, not later than 10:00 a.m., New York City
time, four Business Days before the proposed date of such Borrowing and (ii) in
the case of a Fixed Rate

<PAGE>

                                                                              15

Borrowing, not later than 10:00 a.m., New York City time, one Business Day
before the proposed date of such Borrowing. A Competitive Bid Request shall not
be made within five Business Days after the date of any previous Competitive Bid
Request. No ABR Loan shall be requested in, or made pursuant to, a Competitive
Bid Request. A Competitive Bid Request that does not conform substantially to
the format of Exhibit D-1 may be rejected by the Administrative Agent and the
Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower of such rejection as promptly as
practicable. Each Competitive Bid Request shall refer to this Agreement and
specify (i) whether the Borrowing being requested is to be a Eurodollar
Competitive Borrowing or a Fixed Rate Borrowing; (ii) the date of such Borrowing
(which shall be a Business Day); (iii) the number and the location of the
account to which funds are to be disbursed (which shall be an account that
complies with the requirements of Section 2.02(c)); (iv) the aggregate principal
amount of such Borrowing, which shall be a minimum of $10,000,000 and an
integral multiple of $1,000,000 and not greater than the Total Commitment then
available; and (v) the Interest Period with respect thereto (which may not end
after the Maturity Date unless the Borrower has given notice to extend payment
of the principal amount of the Loans until the first anniversary of the Maturity
Date in accordance with subsection 2.05(a)). Promptly after its receipt of a
Competitive Bid Request that is not rejected, the Administrative Agent shall by
telecopy in the form set forth in Exhibit D-2 invite the Lenders to bid to make
Competitive Loans pursuant to the Competitive Bid Request.

     (b)  Each Lender may make one or more Competitive Bids to the Borrower
responsive to a Competitive Bid Request. Each Competitive Bid by a Lender must
be received by the Administrative Agent by telecopy in the form of Exhibit D-3,
(i) in the case of a Eurodollar Competitive Borrowing, not later than 9:30 a.m.,
New York City time, three Business Days before the proposed date of such
Competitive Borrowing and (ii) in the case of a Fixed Rate Borrowing, not later
than 9:30 a.m., New York City time, on the proposed date of such Competitive
Borrowing. Competitive Bids that do not conform substantially to the format of
Exhibit D-3 may be rejected by the Administrative Agent, and the Administrative
Agent shall notify the applicable Lender as promptly as practicable. Each
Competitive Bid shall refer to this Agreement and specify (x) the principal
amount (which shall be a minimum of $5,000,000 and an integral multiple of
$1,000,000 and which may equal the entire principal amount of the Competitive
Borrowing requested by the Borrower) of the Competitive Loan or Loans that the
Lender is willing to make, (y) the Competitive Bid Rate or Rates at which the
Lender is prepared to make such Loan or Loans and (z) the Interest Period
applicable to such Loan or Loans and the last day thereof.

     (c)  The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower by
telecopy of the Competitive Bid Rate and the principal amount of each
Competitive Loan in respect of which a Competitive Bid shall have been made and
the identity of the Lender that shall have made each bid.

     (d)  The Borrower may, subject only to the provisions of this paragraph
(d), accept or reject any Competitive Bid. The Borrower shall notify the
Administrative Agent by telephone, confirmed by telecopy in the form of a
Competitive Bid Accept/Reject Letter, whether and to what extent it has decided
to accept or reject each Competitive Bid, (x) in the case of a Eurodollar
Competitive Borrowing, not later than 10:30 a.m., New York City time, three
Business Days before the date of the proposed Competitive Borrowing and (y) in
the case of a Fixed Rate Borrowing, not later than 10:30 a.m., New York City
time, on the proposed date of the Competitive Borrowing; provided, however, that
(i) the failure of the Borrower to give such notice shall be deemed to be a
rejection of each Competitive Bid, (ii) the Borrower shall not accept a
Competitive Bid made at a particular Competitive Bid Rate if the Borrower has
decided to reject a Competitive Bid made at a lower Competitive Bid Rate, (iii)
the aggregate amount of the Competitive Bids accepted by the Borrower shall not
exceed (but may be less than) the principal amount specified in the Competitive
Bid Request, (iv) if the Borrower shall accept a Competitive Bid or Bids made at
a particular Competitive Bid Rate but the amount of such Competitive Bid or Bids
would cause the total amount to be accepted by the Borrower to exceed the amount
specified in the Competitive Bid Request, then the Borrower shall accept a
portion of such Competitive Bid or Bids in an amount equal to

<PAGE>

                                                                              16

the amount specified in the Competitive Bid Request less the amount of all other
Competitive Bids so accepted, which acceptance, in the case of multiple
Competitive Bids at such Competitive Bid Rate, shall be made pro rata in
accordance with the amount of each such Bid and (v) except pursuant to clause
(iv) above, no Competitive Bid shall be accepted for a Competitive Loan unless
such Competitive Loan is in a minimum principal amount of $5,000,000 and an
integral multiple of $1,000,000; provided further, however, that if a
Competitive Loan must be in an amount less than $5,000,000 because of the
provisions of clause (iv) above, such Competitive Loan may be for a minimum of
$1,000,000 or any integral multiple thereof, and in calculating the pro rata
allocation of acceptances of portions of multiple Competitive Bids at a
particular Competitive Bid Rate pursuant to clause (iv) the amounts shall be
rounded to integral multiples of $1,000,000 in a manner determined by the
Borrower. A notice given by the Borrower pursuant to this paragraph (d) shall be
irrevocable.

     (e)  The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each bidding Lender by
telecopy whether or not its Competitive Bid has been accepted (and, if so, in
what amount and at what Competitive Bid Rate), and each successful bidder will
thereupon become bound, upon the terms and subject to the conditions hereof, to
make the Competitive Loan in respect of which its Competitive Bid has been
accepted.

     (f)  If the Administrative Agent shall elect to submit a Competitive Bid in
its capacity as a Lender, it shall submit such Competitive Bid directly to the
Borrower at least one quarter of an hour earlier than the time by which the
other Lenders are required to submit their Competitive Bids to the
Administrative Agent pursuant to paragraph (b) above.

     SECTION 2.04.   Borrowing Procedure. In order to request a Borrowing
(other than a Competitive Borrowing, as to which this Section 2.04 shall not
apply), the Borrower shall hand deliver or telecopy to the Administrative Agent
a duly completed Borrowing Request (a) in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing,
not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, three Business Days before a
proposed Borrowing and (b) in the case of an ABR Borrowing, not later than 10:00
a.m., New York City time, on the day of a proposed Borrowing. Each Borrowing
Request shall be irrevocable, signed by or on behalf of the Borrower, and shall
specify the following information: (i) whether the Borrowing then being
requested is to be a Eurodollar Borrowing or an ABR Borrowing; (ii) the date of
such Borrowing (which shall be a Business Day); (iii) the number and location of
the account to which funds are to be disbursed (which shall be an account that
complies with the requirements of Section 2.02(c)); (iv) the amount of such
Borrowing; and (v) if such Borrowing is to be a Eurodollar Borrowing, the
Interest Period with respect thereto; provided, however, that, notwithstanding
any contrary specification in any Borrowing Request, each requested Borrowing
shall comply with the requirements set forth in Section 2.02. If no election as
to the Type of Borrowing is specified in any such notice, then the requested
Borrowing shall be an ABR Borrowing. If no Interest Period with respect to any
Eurodollar Borrowing is specified in any such notice, then the Borrower shall be
deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month's duration. The
Administrative Agent shall promptly advise the Lenders of any notice given
pursuant to this Section 2.04 (and the contents thereof), and of each Lender's
portion of the requested Borrowing.

     SECTION 2.05.   Evidence of Debt; Repayment of Loans. (a) The Borrower
hereby agrees that the outstanding principal balance of each Revolving Loan
shall be payable on the Maturity Date and the outstanding principal balance of
each Competitive Loan shall be payable on the last day of the Interest Period
applicable thereto. Each Loan shall bear interest from and including the date of
such Loan on the outstanding principal balance thereof as set forth in Section
2.07. The Borrower may, upon written notice to the Administrative Agent given
not more than 60 days and at least 15 days prior to the Maturity Date, extend
the date upon which the principal amount of the Loans of the Lenders outstanding
as of the Maturity Date will be due and payable to the first anniversary of the
Maturity Date. If the Borrower gives notice to the Administrative Agent in
accordance with the preceding sentence, the Borrower hereby

<PAGE>

                                                                              17

unconditionally promises to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of
each Lender the then unpaid principal amount of the Loans of such Lender on the
first anniversary of the Maturity Date (or such earlier date on which the Loans
become due and payable pursuant to Article VII).

     (b)  Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an
account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower to such Lender
resulting from each Loan made by such Lender from time to time, including the
amounts of principal and interest payable and paid by such Lender from time to
time under this Agreement.

     (c)  The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which it will
record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Type thereof and the
Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest
due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to each Lender
hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent
hereunder from the Borrower and each Lender's share thereof.

     (d)  The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to paragraphs (b)
and (c) of this Section 2.05 shall be prima facie evidence of the existence and
amounts of the obligations therein recorded; provided, however, that the failure
of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or any error
therein shall not in any manner affect the obligations of the Borrower to repay
the Loans in accordance with their terms.

     (e)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in the event
any Lender shall request and receive a promissory note payable to such Lender
and its registered assigns, the interests represented by such note shall at all
times (including after any assignment of all or part of such interests pursuant
to Section 10.04) be represented by one or more promissory notes payable to the
payee named therein or its registered assigns.

     SECTION 2.06.   Fees. (a) The Borrower agrees to pay to the
Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender a facility fee (a "Facility
Fee") for the period from and including the Closing Date to the later of (i) the
Maturity Date (or if the Borrower gives notice to the Administrative Agent
pursuant to Section 2.05(a), the first anniversary of the Maturity Date) and
(ii) the date the Commitments have been terminated and the principal of and
interest on each Loan, all Fees and all other expenses or amounts payable under
this Agreement shall have been paid in full, computed at the Applicable
Percentage on the average daily amount of the Commitments (whether used or
unused) or, after the Maturity Date or after the Commitments have been otherwise
terminated hereunder, the average daily amount of the Loans outstanding, of such
Lender during the period for which payment is made, payable quarterly in arrears
on the last day of each March, June, September and December and on the later of
(i) the Maturity Date (or if the Borrower gives notice to the Administrative
Agent pursuant to Section 2.05(a), the first anniversary of the Maturity Date)
and (ii) the date the Commitments have been terminated and the principal of and
interest on each Loan, all Fees and all other expenses or amounts payable under
this Agreement shall have been paid in full, commencing on the first of such
dates to occur after the date hereof. All Facility Fees shall be computed on the
basis of the actual number of days elapsed in a year of 360 days.

     (b)  The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the ratable
account of each Lender, a utilization fee (a "Utilization Fee") at a rate per
annum equal to 0.125% for each Excess Utilization Day during the period for
which payment is made on the outstanding Loans of such Lender on such Excess
Utilization Day. Such Utilization Fees shall be payable quarterly in arrears on
the last day of each March, June, September and December and on the later of (i)
the Maturity Date (or if the Borrower gives notice to the Administrative Agent
pursuant to Section 2.05(a), the first anniversary of the Maturity Date) and
(ii) the date the Commitments have been terminated and the principal of and
interest on each

<PAGE>

                                                                              18

Loan, all Fees and all other expenses or amounts payable under this Agreement
shall have been paid in full, commencing on the first of such dates to occur
after the Closing Date.

     (c)  The Borrower agrees to pay to each of the Agents or their Affiliates,
for their own account, the fees set forth in the Fee Letter at the times and in
the amounts specified therein (the "Agents' Fees").

     (d)  All Fees shall be paid on the dates due, in immediately available
funds. Once paid, none of the Fees shall be refundable under any circumstances.

     SECTION 2.07.   Interest on Loans. (a) Subject to the provisions of
Section 2.08, the Loans comprising each ABR Borrowing shall bear interest
(computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over a year of 365
or 366 days, as the case may be, when the Alternate Base Rate is determined by
reference to the Prime Rate and over a year of 360 days at all other times) at a
rate per annum equal to the Alternate Base Rate plus the Applicable Percentage
in effect from time to time.

     (b)  Subject to the provisions of Section 2.08, the Loans comprising each
Eurodollar Borrowing shall bear interest (computed on the basis of the actual
number of days elapsed over a year of 360 days) at a rate per annum equal to (i)
in the case of each Revolving Loan, the Eurodollar Rate for the Interest Period
in effect for such Borrowing plus the Applicable Percentage in effect from time
to time and (ii) in the case of each Competitive Loan, the Eurodollar Rate for
the Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing plus the Margin offered by the
Lender making such Loan and accepted by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.03.

     (c)  Subject to the provisions of Section 2.08, each Fixed Rate Loan shall
bear interest (computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over a
year of 360 days) at a rate per annum equal to the fixed rate of interest
offered by the Lender making such Loan and accepted by the Borrower pursuant to
Section 2.03.

     (d)  Interest on each Loan shall be payable on the Interest Payment Dates
applicable to such Loan except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. Any
change in the interest rate on a Loan resulting from a change in the Alternate
Base Rate or the Eurocurrency Reserve Requirements shall become effective as of
the opening of business on the day on which such change becomes effective. The
applicable Alternate Base Rate or Eurodollar Rate for each Interest Period or
day within an Interest Period, as the case may be, shall be determined by the
Administrative Agent, and such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest
error.

     SECTION 2.08.   Default Interest. If the Borrower shall default in the
payment of the principal of or interest on any Loan or any other amount becoming
due hereunder, by acceleration or otherwise, the Borrower shall on demand from
time to time pay interest, to the extent permitted by law, on such defaulted
amount to but excluding the date of actual payment (after as well as before
judgment) (a) in the case of overdue principal, at the rate otherwise applicable
to such Loan pursuant to Section 2.07 plus 2.00% per annum and (b) in all other
cases, at a rate per annum (computed on the basis of the actual number of days
elapsed over a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, when determined by
reference to the Prime Rate and over a year of 360 days at all other times)
equal to the sum of the Alternate Base Rate plus 2.00%.

     SECTION 2.09.   Alternate Rate of Interest. In the event, and on each
occasion, that on the day two Business Days prior to the commencement of any
Interest Period for a Eurodollar Borrowing the Administrative Agent shall have
determined that (a) Dollar deposits in the principal amounts of the Loans
comprising such Borrowing are not generally available in the London interbank
market, or (b) the rates at

<PAGE>

                                                                              19

which such Dollar deposits are being offered will not adequately and fairly
reflect the cost to Lenders having Commitments representing at least 20% of the
Total Commitment of making or maintaining Eurodollar Loans during such Interest
Period, or (c) reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Eurodollar
Rate, the Administrative Agent shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, give
written or telecopy notice of such determination to the Borrower and the
Lenders. In the event of any such determination (other than any such
determination pursuant to clause (b) of the preceding sentence, to the extent
the circumstances giving rise to such determination would also give Lenders the
right to demand additional amounts pursuant to Section 2.13), until the
Administrative Agent shall have advised the Borrower and the Lenders that the
circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any request by the
Borrower for a Eurodollar Revolving Credit Borrowing pursuant to Section 2.04
shall be deemed to be a request for an ABR Borrowing and (ii) any request by the
Borrower for a Eurodollar Competitive Borrowing pursuant to Section 2.03 shall
be of no force and effect and shall be denied by the Administrative Agent. Each
determination by the Administrative Agent hereunder shall be conclusive absent
manifest error.

     SECTION 2.10.   Termination and Reduction of Commitments. (a) The
Commitments shall automatically terminate on the Maturity Date.

     (b)  Upon at least three Business Days' prior irrevocable written or
telecopy notice to the Administrative Agent, the Borrower may at any time in
whole permanently terminate, or from time to time in part permanently reduce,
the Commitments; provided, however, that (i) each partial reduction of the
Commitments shall be in an integral multiple of $1,000,000 and in a minimum
amount of $10,000,000 and (ii) the Total Commitment shall not be reduced to an
amount that is less than the sum of the Aggregate Revolving Credit Exposure and
the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Competitive Loans at the time.

     (c)  Each reduction in the Commitments hereunder shall be made ratably
among the Lenders in accordance with their respective Commitments. The Borrower
shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable Lenders,
on the date of each termination or reduction, the Facility Fees on the amount of
the Commitments so terminated or reduced accrued to but excluding the date of
such termination or reduction.

     SECTION 2.11.   Conversion and Continuation of Revolving Credit
Borrowings. The Borrower shall have the right at any time upon prior irrevocable
notice to the Administrative Agent (a) not later than 10:00 a.m., New York City
time, on the day of conversion, to convert any Eurodollar Borrowing into an ABR
Borrowing, (b) not later than 10:00 a.m., New York City time, three Business
Days prior to conversion or continuation, to convert any ABR Borrowing into a
Eurodollar Borrowing or to continue any Eurodollar Borrowing as a Eurodollar
Borrowing for an additional Interest Period, and (c) not later than 10:00 a.m.,
New York City time, three Business Days prior to conversion, to convert the
Interest Period with respect to any Eurodollar Borrowing to another permissible
Interest Period, subject in each case to the following:

     (i)       each conversion or continuation shall be made pro rata among the
     Lenders in accordance with the respective principal amounts of the Loans
     comprising the converted or continued Borrowing;

     (ii)      if less than all the outstanding principal amount of any
     Borrowing shall be converted or continued, then each resulting Borrowing
     shall satisfy the limitations specified in Sections 2.02(a) and 2.02(b)
     regarding the principal amount and maximum number of Borrowings of the
     relevant Type;

                                                                              20

     (iii)     each conversion shall be effected by each Lender by recording for
     the account of such Lender the new Loan of such Lender resulting from such
     conversion and reducing the Loan (or portion thereof) of such Lender being
     converted by an equivalent principal amount; accrued interest on any
     Eurodollar Loan (or portion thereof) being converted shall be paid by the
     Borrower at the time of conversion;

     (iv)      if any Eurodollar Borrowing is converted at a time other than the
     end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, the Borrower shall pay, upon
     demand, any amounts due to the Lenders pursuant to Section 2.15;

     (v)       subject to Section 2.05(a), any portion of a Borrowing maturing
     or required to be repaid in less than one month may not be converted into
     or continued as a Eurodollar Borrowing; and

     (vi)      any portion of a Eurodollar Borrowing that cannot be converted
     into or continued as a Eurodollar Borrowing by reason of the immediately
     preceding clause shall be automatically converted at the end of the
     Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing into an ABR Borrowing.

     Each notice pursuant to this Section 2.11 shall be irrevocable and shall
refer to this Agreement and specify (i) the identity and amount of the Borrowing
that the Borrower requests be converted or continued, (ii) whether such
Borrowing is to be converted into or continued as a Eurodollar Borrowing or an
ABR Borrowing, (iii) if such notice requests a conversion, the date of such
conversion (which shall be a Business Day) and (iv) if such Borrowing is to be
converted into or continued as a Eurodollar Borrowing, the Interest Period with
respect thereto (which, subject to Section 2.05(a), may not end after the
Maturity Date). If no Interest Period is specified in any such notice with
respect to any conversion into or continuation as a Eurodollar Borrowing, the
Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month's
duration. The Administrative Agent shall advise the other Lenders of any notice
given pursuant to this Section 2.11 and of each Lender's portion of any
converted or continued Borrowing. If the Borrower shall not have given notice in
accordance with this Section 2.11 to continue any Borrowing into a subsequent
Interest Period (and shall not otherwise have given notice in accordance with
this Section 2.11 to convert such Borrowing), such Borrowing shall, at the end
of the Interest Period applicable thereto (unless repaid pursuant to the terms
hereof), automatically be continued into a new Interest Period as an ABR
Borrowing. The Borrower shall not have the right to continue or convert the
Interest Period with respect to any Competitive Borrowing pursuant to this
Section 2.11.

     SECTION 2.12.   Prepayment. (a) The Borrower shall have the right at any
time and from time to time to prepay any Borrowing (other than a Competitive
Borrowing), in whole or in part, upon at least three Business Days' prior
written or telecopy notice (or telephone notice promptly confirmed by written or
telecopy notice) to the Administrative Agent before 11:00 a.m., New York City
time; provided, however, that each partial prepayment shall be in an amount that
is an integral multiple of $1,000,000 and not less than $10,000,000. The
Borrower shall not have the right to prepay any Competitive Borrowing without
the prior written consent of the relevant Lender.

     (b)  In the event of any termination of the Commitments, the Borrower shall
repay or prepay all its outstanding Revolving Credit Borrowings on the date of
such termination. In the event of any partial reduction of the Commitments, then
(i) at or prior to the effective date of such reduction, the Administrative
Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders of the Aggregate Revolving
Credit Exposure and (ii) if the Aggregate Revolving Credit Exposure would exceed
the available Total Commitment after giving effect to such reduction, the
Borrower shall, on the date of such reduction, repay or prepay Revolving Credit
Borrowings in an amount sufficient to eliminate such excess.

                                                                              21

     (c)  Each notice of prepayment shall specify the prepayment date and the
principal amount of each Borrowing (or portion thereof) to be prepaid, shall be
irrevocable and shall commit the Borrower to prepay such Borrowing by the amount
stated therein on the date stated therein. All prepayments under this Section
2.12 shall be subject to Section 2.15 but otherwise without premium or penalty.
All prepayments of Eurodollar Loans under this Section 2.12 shall be accompanied
by accrued interest on the principal amount being prepaid to the date of
payment.

     SECTION 2.13.   Reserve Requirements; Change in Circumstances. (a)
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if after the date of this
Agreement the adoption of, or any change in, applicable law or regulation or in
the interpretation or administration thereof by any Governmental Authority
charged with the interpretation or administration thereof (whether or not having
the force of law) shall impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special
deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the
account of or credit extended by any Lender or shall impose on such Lender or
the London interbank market any other condition affecting this Agreement or
Eurodollar Loans or Fixed Rate Loans made by such Lender, and the result of any
of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making or
maintaining any Eurodollar Loan or Fixed Rate Loan, or to reduce the amount of
any sum received or receivable by such Lender hereunder (whether of principal,
interest or otherwise) by an amount deemed by such Lender to be material, then
the Borrower will pay to such Lender upon demand such additional amount or
amounts as will compensate such Lender for such additional costs incurred or
reduction suffered.

     (b)  If any Lender shall have determined that the adoption after the date
hereof of any law, rule, regulation, agreement or guideline regarding capital
adequacy, or any change after the date hereof in any such law, rule, regulation,
agreement or guideline (whether such law, rule, regulation, agreement or
guideline has been adopted) or in the interpretation or administration thereof
by any Governmental Authority charged with the interpretation or administration
thereof, or compliance by any Lender (or any lending office of such Lender) or
any Lender's holding company with any request or directive regarding capital
adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) of any Governmental Authority
has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's
capital or on the capital of such Lender's holding company, if any, as a
consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made by such Lender pursuant hereto
to a level below that which such Lender or such Lender's holding company could
have achieved but for such applicability, adoption, change or compliance (taking
into consideration such Lender's policies and the policies of such Lender's
holding company with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by such
Lender to be material, then from time to time the Borrower shall pay to such
Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such
Lender's holding company for any such reduction suffered.

     (c)  A certificate of a Lender setting forth the amount or amounts
necessary to compensate such Lender or its holding company (including the
calculation thereof) as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) above shall be
delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The
Borrower shall pay to such Lender the amount shown as due on any such
certificate delivered by it within 10 days after its receipt of the same.

     (d)  Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation for
any increased costs or reduction in amounts received or receivable or reduction
in return on capital shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's right to
demand such compensation. The protection of this Section shall be available to
each Lender regardless of any possible contention of the invalidity or
inapplicability of the law, rule, regulation, agreement, guideline or other
change or condition that shall have occurred or been imposed. Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Section, no Lender shall be entitled to demand
compensation hereunder in respect of any Competitive Loan if it shall have been
aware of the event or

<PAGE>

                                                                              22

circumstance giving rise to such demand at the time it submitted the Competitive
Bid pursuant to which such Loan was made.

     SECTION 2.14.   Change in Legality. (a) Notwithstanding any other provision
of this Agreement, if, after the date hereof, any change in any law or
regulation or in the interpretation thereof by any Governmental Authority
charged with the administration or interpretation thereof shall make it unlawful
for any Lender to make or maintain any Eurodollar Loan or to give effect to its
obligations as contemplated hereby with respect to any Eurodollar Loan, then, by
written notice to the Borrower and to the Administrative Agent:

     (i)       such Lender may declare that Eurodollar Loans will not thereafter
     (for the duration of such unlawfulness) be made by such Lender hereunder
     (or be continued for additional Interest Periods and ABR Loans will not
     thereafter (for such duration) be converted into Eurodollar Loans),
     whereupon such Lender shall not submit a Competitive Bid in response to a
     request for a Eurodollar Competitive Loan and any request for a Eurodollar
     Borrowing (or to convert an ABR Borrowing to a Eurodollar Borrowing or to
     continue a Eurodollar Borrowing for an additional Interest Period) shall,
     as to such Lender only, be deemed a request for an ABR Loan unless such
     declaration shall be subsequently withdrawn (or a request to continue an
     ABR Loan as such for an additional Interest Period or to convert a
     Eurodollar Loan into an ABR Loan, as the case may be); and

     (ii)      such Lender may require that all outstanding Eurodollar Loans
     made by it be converted to ABR Loans, in which event all such Eurodollar
     Loans shall be automatically converted to ABR Loans as of the effective
     date of such notice as provided in paragraph (b) below.

In the event any Lender shall exercise its rights under (i) or (ii) above, all
payments and prepayments of principal that would otherwise have been applied to
repay the Eurodollar Loans that would have been made by such Lender or the
converted Eurodollar Loans of such Lender shall instead be applied to repay the
ABR Loans made by such Lender in lieu of, or resulting from the conversion of,
such Eurodollar Loans.

     (b)  For purposes of this Section 2.14, a notice to the Borrower by any
Lender shall be effective as to each Eurodollar Loan made by such Lender, if
lawful, on the last day of the Interest Period currently applicable to such
Eurodollar Loan; in all other cases such notice shall be effective on the date
of receipt by the Borrower.

     SECTION 2.15.   Indemnity. The Borrower shall indemnify each Lender against
any loss or expense that such Lender may sustain or incur as a consequence of
any event, other than a default by such Lender in the performance of its
obligations hereunder, that results in (i) such Lender receiving or being deemed
to receive any amount on account of the principal of any Fixed Rate Loan or
Eurodollar Loan prior to the end of the Interest Period in effect therefor, (ii)
the conversion of any Eurodollar Loan to an ABR Loan, or the conversion of the
Interest Period with respect to any Eurodollar Loan, in each case prior to the
end of the Interest Period in effect therefor or (iii) any Fixed Rate Loan or
Eurodollar Loan to be made by such Lender (including any Eurodollar Loan to be
made pursuant to a conversion or continuation under Section 2.11) not being made
after notice of such Loan shall have been given by the Borrower hereunder (any
of the events referred to in this sentence being called a "Breakage Event"). In
the case of any Breakage Event, such loss shall include an amount equal to the
excess, as reasonably determined by such Lender, of (i) its cost of obtaining
funds for the Eurodollar Loan or Fixed Rate Loan that is the subject of such
Breakage Event for the period from the date of such Breakage Event to the last
day of the Interest Period in effect (or that would have been in effect) for
such Loan over (ii) the amount of interest likely to be realized by such Lender
in redeploying the funds released or not utilized by reason

<PAGE>

                                                                              23

of such Breakage Event for such period. A certificate of any Lender setting
forth any amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to
this Section 2.15 shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive
absent manifest error.

     SECTION 2.16.   Pro Rata Treatment. Except as provided in the two
succeeding sentences with respect to Competitive Borrowings and as required
under Section 2.14, each Borrowing, each payment or prepayment of principal of
any Borrowing, each payment of interest on the Loans, each payment of the
Facility Fees, each reduction of the Commitments and each continuation or
conversion of any Borrowing to a Borrowing of any Type shall be allocated pro
rata among the Lenders in accordance with their respective Commitments (or, if
such Commitments shall have expired or been terminated, in accordance with the
respective principal amounts of their outstanding Loans). Each payment of
principal of any Competitive Borrowing shall be allocated pro rata among the
Lenders participating in such Borrowing in accordance with the respective
principal amounts of their outstanding Competitive Loans comprising such
Borrowing. Each payment of interest on any Competitive Borrowing shall be
allocated pro rata among the Lenders participating in such Borrowing in
accordance with the respective amounts of accrued and unpaid interest on their
outstanding Competitive Loans comprising such Borrowing. For purposes of
determining the available Commitments of the Lenders at any time, each
outstanding Competitive Borrowing shall be deemed to have utilized the
Commitments of the Lenders (including those Lenders that shall not have made
Loans as part of such Competitive Borrowing) pro rata in accordance with such
respective Commitments. Each Lender agrees that in computing such Lender's
portion of any Borrowing to be made hereunder, the Administrative Agent may, in
its discretion, round each Lender's percentage of such Borrowing to the next
higher or lower whole Dollar amount.

     SECTION 2.17.   Sharing of Setoffs. Each Lender agrees that if it shall,
through the exercise of a right of banker's lien, setoff or counterclaim against
the Borrower, or pursuant to a secured claim under Section 506 of Title 11 of
the United States Code or other security or interest arising from, or in lieu
of, such secured claim, received by such Lender under any applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency or other similar law or otherwise, or by any other means, obtain
payment (voluntary or involuntary) in respect of any Revolving Loan or Loans as
a result of which the unpaid principal portion of its Revolving Loans shall be
proportionately less than the unpaid principal portion of the Revolving Loans of
any other Lender, it shall be deemed simultaneously to have purchased from such
other Lender at face value, and shall promptly pay to such other Lender the
purchase price for, a participation in the Revolving Loans of such other Lender,
so that the aggregate unpaid principal amount of the Revolving Loans and
participations in Revolving Loans held by each Lender shall be in the same
proportion to the aggregate unpaid principal amount of all Revolving Loans then
outstanding as the principal amount of its Revolving Loans prior to such
exercise of banker's lien, setoff or counterclaim or other event was to the
principal amount of all Revolving Loans outstanding prior to such exercise of
banker's lien, setoff or counterclaim or other event; provided, however, that,
if any such purchase or purchases or adjustments shall be made pursuant to this
Section and the payment giving rise thereto shall thereafter be recovered, such
purchase or purchases or adjustments shall be rescinded to the extent of such
recovery and the purchase price or prices or adjustment restored without
interest. The Borrower expressly consents to the foregoing arrangements and
agrees that any Lender holding a participation in a Revolving Loan deemed to
have been so purchased may exercise any and all rights of banker's lien, setoff
or counterclaim with respect to any and all moneys owing by the Borrower to such
Lender by reason thereof as fully as if such Lender had made a Revolving Loan
directly to the Borrower in the amount of such participation.

     SECTION 2.18.   Payments. (a) The Borrower shall make each payment
(including principal of or interest on any Borrowing or any Fees or other
amounts) hereunder not later than 12:00 (noon), New York City time, on the date
when due in immediately available Dollars, without defense, setoff or
counterclaim. Each such payment shall be made to the Administrative Agent at its
offices at 270 Park Avenue, New York, New York.

<PAGE>

                                                                              24

     (b)  Whenever any payment (including principal of or interest on any
Borrowing or any Fees or other amounts) hereunder shall become due, or otherwise
would occur, on a day that is not a Business Day, such payment may be made on
the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case
be included in the computation of interest or Fees, if applicable.

     SECTION 2.19.   Taxes. (a) Any and all payments by the Borrower hereunder
shall be made, in accordance with Section 2.18, free and clear of and without
deduction for any and all current or future taxes, levies, imposts, deductions,
charges or withholdings, and all liabilities with respect thereto, excluding (i)
income taxes imposed on the net income of the Administrative Agent or any Lender
(or any transferee or assignee thereof, including a participation holder (any
such entity a "Transferee")) and (ii) franchise taxes imposed on the net income
of the Administrative Agent or any Lender (or Transferee), in each case by the
jurisdiction under the laws of which the Administrative Agent or such Lender (or
Transferee) is organized or any political subdivision thereof (all such
nonexcluded taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges, withholdings and
liabilities, collectively or individually, being called "Taxes"). If the
Borrower shall be required to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum
payable hereunder to the Administrative Agent or any Lender (or any Transferee),
(i) the sum payable shall be increased by the amount (an "additional amount")
necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions
applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.19) the
Administrative Agent or such Lender (or Transferee), as the case may be, shall
receive an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions
been made, (ii) the Borrower shall make such deductions and (iii) the Borrower
shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in
accordance with applicable law.

     (b)  In addition, the Borrower agrees to pay to the relevant Governmental
Authority in accordance with applicable law any current or future stamp or
documentary taxes or any other excise or property taxes, charges or similar
levies that arise from any payment made hereunder or from the execution,
delivery or registration of, or otherwise with respect to, this Agreement
("Other Taxes").

     (c)  The Borrower will indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Lender
(or Transferee) for the full amount of Taxes and Other Taxes paid by the
Administrative Agent or such Lender (or Transferee), as the case may be, and any
liability (including penalties, interest and expenses (including reasonable
attorney's fees and expenses)) arising therefrom or with respect thereto,
whether or not such Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally asserted by
the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such
payment or liability prepared by the Administrative Agent or a Lender (or
Transferee), or the Administrative Agent on its behalf, absent manifest error,
shall be final, conclusive and binding for all purposes. Such indemnification
shall be made within 30 days after the date the Administrative Agent or any
Lender (or Transferee), as the case may be, makes written demand therefor.

     (d)  If the Administrative Agent or a Lender (or Transferee) receives a
refund in respect of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been
indemnified by the Borrower or with respect to which the Borrower has paid
additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.19, it shall within 30 days from
the date of such receipt pay over such refund to the Borrower (but only to the
extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the Borrower
under this Section 2.19 with respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to
such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative Agent or
such Lender (or Transferee) and without interest (other than interest paid by
the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund); provided,
however, that the Borrower, upon the request of the Administrative Agent or such
Lender (or Transferee), shall repay the amount paid over to the Borrower (plus
penalties, interest or other charges) to the Administrative Agent or such Lender
(or Transferee) in the event the Administrative Agent or such Lender (or
Transferee) is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority.

                                                                              25

     (e)  As soon as practicable after the date of any payment of Taxes or Other
Taxes by the Borrower to the relevant Governmental Authority, the Borrower will
deliver to the Administrative Agent, at its address referred to in Section
10.01, the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental
Authority evidencing payment thereof.

     (f)  Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement contained
herein, the agreements and obligations contained in this Section 2.19 shall
survive the payment in full of the principal of and interest on all Loans made
hereunder.

     (g)  Each Lender (or Transferee) that is organized under the laws of a
jurisdiction other than the United States, any State thereof or the District of
Columbia (a "Non-U.S. Lender") shall deliver to each of the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent two copies of either United States Internal Revenue Service
Form W-8BEN or Form W-8ECI, or, in the case of a Non-U.S. Lender claiming
exemption from U.S. Federal withholding tax under Section 871(h) or 881(c) of
the Code with respect to payments of "portfolio interest", a Form W-8BEN, or any
subsequent versions thereof or successors thereto (and, if such Non-U.S. Lender
delivers a Form W-8BEN, a certificate representing that such Non-U.S. Lender is
not a bank for purposes of Section 881(c) of the Code, is not a 10-percent
shareholder (within the meaning of Section 871(h)(3)(B) of the Code) of the
Borrower and is not a controlled foreign corporation related to the Borrower
(within the meaning of Section 864(d)(4) of the Code)), properly completed and
duly executed by such Non-U.S. Lender claiming complete exemption from, or
reduced rate of, U.S. Federal withholding tax on payments by the Borrower under
this Agreement. Such forms shall be delivered by each Non-U.S. Lender on or
before the date it becomes a party to this Agreement (or, in the case of a
Transferee that is a participation holder, on or before the date such
participation holder becomes a Transferee hereunder) and on or before the date,
if any, such Non-U.S. Lender changes its applicable lending office by
designating a different lending office (a "New Lending Office"). In addition,
each Non-U.S. Lender shall deliver such forms promptly upon the obsolescence or
invalidity of any form previously delivered by such Non-U.S. Lender.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 2.19(g), a Non-U.S. Lender
shall not be required to deliver any form pursuant to this Section 2.19(g) that
such Non-U.S. Lender is not legally able to deliver.

     (h)  The Borrower shall not be required to indemnify any Non-U.S. Lender or
to pay any additional amounts to any Non-U.S. Lender, in respect of United
States Federal withholding tax pursuant to paragraph (a) or (c) above to the
extent that (i) the obligation to withhold amounts with respect to United States
Federal withholding tax existed under applicable laws and regulations on the
date such Non-U.S. Lender became a party to this Agreement (or, in the case of a
Transferee that is a participation holder, on the date such participation holder
became a Transferee hereunder) or, with respect to payments to a New Lending
Office, the date such Non-U.S. Lender designated such New Lending Office with
respect to a Loan; provided, however, that this paragraph (h) shall not apply
(x) to any Transferee or New Lending Office that becomes a Transferee or New
Lending Office as a result of an assignment, participation, transfer or
designation made at the request of the Borrower and (y) to the extent the
indemnity payment or additional amounts any Transferee, or any Lender (or
Transferee), acting through a New Lending Office, would be entitled to receive
(without regard to this paragraph (h)) do not exceed the indemnity payment or
additional amounts that the person making the assignment, participation or
transfer to such Transferee, or Lender (or Transferee) making the designation of
such New Lending Office, would have been entitled to receive in the absence of
such assignment, participation, transfer or designation or (ii) the obligation
to pay such additional amounts would not have arisen but for a failure by such
Non-U.S. Lender to comply with the provisions of paragraph (g) above.

     (i)  Nothing contained in this Section 2.19 shall require any Lender (or
any Transferee) or the Administrative Agent to make available any of its tax
returns (or any other information that it deems to be confidential or
proprietary).

                                                                              26

     SECTION 2.20.   Assignment of Commitments Under Certain Circumstances; Duty
to Mitigate. (a) In the event (i) any Lender delivers a certificate requesting
compensation pursuant to Section 2.13, (ii) any Lender delivers a notice
described in Section 2.14 or (iii) the Borrower is required to pay any
additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority on account of any
Lender pursuant to Section 2.19, the Borrower may, at its sole expense and
effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such
Lender to transfer and assign, without recourse (in accordance with and subject
to the restrictions contained in Section 10.04), all of its interests, rights
and obligations under this Agreement to an assignee which shall assume such
assigned obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts
such assignment); provided that (x) such assignment shall not conflict with any
law, rule or regulation or order of any court or other Governmental Authority
having jurisdiction, (y) the Borrower shall have received the prior written
consent of the Administrative Agent, which consent shall not unreasonably be
withheld, and (z) the Borrower or such assignee shall have paid to the affected
Lender in immediately available funds an amount equal to the sum of the
principal of and interest accrued to the date of such payment on the outstanding
Loans of such Lender plus all Fees and other amounts accrued for the account of
such Lender hereunder (including any amounts under Section 2.13 and Section
2.15); provided further that if prior to any such transfer and assignment the
circumstances or event that resulted in such Lender's claim for compensation
under Section 2.13 or notice under Section 2.14 or the amounts paid pursuant to
Section 2.19, as the case may be, cease to cause such Lender to suffer increased
costs or reductions in amounts received or receivable or reduction in return on
capital, or cease to have the consequences specified in Section 2.14, or cease
to result in amounts being payable under Section 2.19, as the case may be
(including as a result of any action taken by such Lender pursuant to paragraph
(b) below), or if such Lender shall waive its right to claim further
compensation under Section 2.13 in respect of such circumstances or event or
shall withdraw its notice under Section 2.14 or shall waive its right to further
payments under Section 2.19 in respect of such circumstances or event, as the
case may be, then such Lender shall not thereafter be required to make any such
transfer and assignment hereunder.

     (b)  If (i) any Lender shall request compensation under Section 2.13, (ii)
any Lender delivers a notice described in Section 2.14 or (iii) the Borrower is
required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental
Authority on account of any Lender, pursuant to Section 2.19, then, such Lender
shall use reasonable efforts (which shall not require such Lender to incur an
unreimbursed loss or unreimbursed cost or expense or otherwise take any action
inconsistent with its internal policies or legal or regulatory restrictions or
suffer any disadvantage or burden deemed by it to be significant) (x) to file
any certificate or document reasonably requested in writing by the Borrower or
(y) to assign its rights and delegate and transfer its obligations hereunder to
another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if such filing or assignment
would reduce its claims for compensation under Section 2.13 or enable it to
withdraw its notice pursuant to Section 2.14 or would reduce amounts payable
pursuant to Section 2.19, as the case may be, in the future. The Borrower hereby
agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in
connection with any such filing, assignment, delegation and transfer.

                                   ARTICLE III

                         Representations And Warranties

     To induce the Administrative Agent and the Lenders to enter into this
Agreement and to make the Loans, the Borrower represents and warrants to the
Administrative Agent and each of the Lenders that:

     SECTION 3.01.   Organization; Powers. The Borrower and each of the
Significant Subsidiaries (a) is a corporation duly organized, validly existing
and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, (b)
has all requisite power and authority to own its property and assets and to
carry on its business as now conducted and as proposed to be conducted and (c)
is qualified to do

<PAGE>

                                                                              27

business in, and is in good standing in, every jurisdiction where such
qualification is required, except where the failure so to qualify could not
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. The Borrower has
the corporate power and authority to execute, deliver and perform its
obligations under this Agreement and to borrow hereunder. Schedule 3.01 sets
forth each Significant Subsidiary of the Borrower in existence on the Closing
Date.

     SECTION 3.02.   Authorization. The execution, delivery and performance by
the Borrower of this Agreement and the borrowings hereunder (collectively, the
"Transactions") (a) have been duly authorized by all requisite corporate and, if
required, stockholder action and (b) will not (i) violate (A) any provision of
law, statute, rule or regulation, or of the certificate or articles of
incorporation or other constitutive documents or by-laws of the Borrower or any
Significant Subsidiary, (B) any order of any Governmental Authority or (C) any
material provision of any material indenture, agreement or other instrument to
which the Borrower or any Significant Subsidiary is a party or by which any of
them or any of their property is or may be bound, (ii) be in material conflict
with, result in a material breach of or constitute (alone or with notice or
lapse of time or both) a material default under, or give rise to any right to
accelerate or to require the prepayment, repurchase or redemption of any
obligation under any such material indenture, agreement or other instrument or
(iii) result in the creation or imposition of any Lien upon or with respect to
any property or assets now owned or hereafter acquired by the Borrower or any
Significant Subsidiary.

     SECTION 3.03.   Enforceability. This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by the Borrower and constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation
of the Borrower enforceable against the Borrower in accordance with its terms.

     SECTION 3.04.   Governmental Approvals. No action, consent or approval of,
registration or filing with or any other action by any Governmental Authority is
or will be required in connection with the Transactions, except those which have
been made or obtained.

     SECTION 3.05.   Financial Statements. The Borrower has heretofore furnished
to the Lenders the consolidated balance sheet, statement of income and statement
of cash flows of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries as of and for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2001, audited by and accompanied by the opinion of
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, independent public accountants. Such financial
statements present fairly the financial condition and results of operations of
the Borrower and its Subsidiaries as of such date and for such period and were
prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis. The unaudited
consolidated balance sheet of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries as at March 31,
2002, June 30, 2002 and September 29, 2002, and the related unaudited
consolidated statements of income and cash flows for the three-month periods
ended on such dates, present fairly the consolidated financial condition of the
Borrower and its Subsidiaries as at such dates, and the consolidated results of
its operations and its consolidated cash flows for the three-month periods then
ended (subject to normal year-end audit adjustments). All such financial
statements, including the related schedules and notes thereto, have been
prepared in accordance with GAAP applied consistently throughout the periods
involved (except as disclosed therein). Such financial statements and the notes
thereto, and Schedule 3.05, when taken together, disclose all material
liabilities, direct or contingent, of the Borrower and its consolidated
Subsidiaries as of the date thereof.

     SECTION 3.06.   No Material Adverse Change. There has been no material
adverse change in the business, assets, operations or condition, financial or
otherwise, of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, since
December 31, 2001.

     SECTION 3.07.   Litigation; Compliance with Laws. (a) Except as set forth
on Schedule 3.07, there are not any actions, suits or proceedings at law or in
equity or by or before any Governmental

<PAGE>

                                                                              28

Authority now pending or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened against
or affecting the Borrower or any Subsidiary or any business, property or rights
of any such person (i) that involve this Agreement or the Transactions or (ii)
as to which there is a reasonable possibility of an adverse determination and
that, if adversely determined, could reasonably be expected, individually or in
the aggregate, to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

     (b)  None of the Borrower or any of the Subsidiaries or any of their
respective material properties or assets is in violation of, nor will the
continued operation of their material properties and assets as currently
conducted violate, any law, rule or regulation, or is in default with respect to
any judgment, writ, injunction, decree or order of any Governmental Authority
(including any of the foregoing relating to the environment), where such
violation or default could reasonably be expected to result in a Material
Adverse Effect.

     SECTION 3.08.   Federal Reserve Regulations. (a) Neither the Borrower nor
any of the Subsidiaries is engaged principally, or as one of its important
activities, in the business of extending credit for the purpose of buying or
carrying Margin Stock.

     (b)  No part of the proceeds of any Loan will be used, whether directly or
indirectly, and whether immediately, incidentally or ultimately for any purpose
that entails a violation of, or that is inconsistent with, the provisions of the
Regulations of the Board, including Regulation U or X. Margin Stocks do not
constitute 25% or more of the fair market value of the assets of the Borrower
and the Subsidiaries subject to the restrictions of Section 6.01.

     SECTION 3.09.   Investment Company Act; Public Utility Holding Company Act.
Neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary is (a) an "investment company", or a
company "controlled" by an "investment company", as defined in, or subject to
regulation under, the Investment Company Act of 1940 or (b) a "holding company"
as defined in, or subject to regulation under, the Public Utility Holding
Company Act of 1935. SECTION 3.10. Tax Returns. Each of the Borrower and the
Subsidiaries has filed or caused to be filed all Federal and all material state,
local and foreign tax returns or materials required to have been filed by it and
has paid or caused to be paid all taxes shown to be due and payable by it on
such returns and all assessments received by it, except taxes that are being
contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and for which the Borrower or
such Subsidiaries, as applicable, shall have set aside on its books adequate
reserves in accordance with GAAP.

     SECTION 3.11.   No Material Misstatements. Neither (a) the Confidential
Information Memorandum nor (b) any other information, report, financial
statement, exhibit or schedule furnished in writing by or on behalf of the
Borrower to the Administrative Agent or any Lender in connection with the
negotiation of this Agreement or included herein or delivered pursuant hereto
contained, contains or will contain any material misstatement of fact or
omitted, omits or will omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were, are
or will be made, not misleading; provided that to the extent any such
information, report, financial statement, exhibit or schedule was based upon or
constitutes a forecast or projection, the Borrower represents only that it acted
in good faith and utilized reasonable assumptions and due care in the
preparation of such information, report, financial statement, exhibit or
schedule.

     SECTION 3.12.   Employee Benefit Plans. Each of the Borrower and its ERISA
Affiliates is in compliance in all material respects with the applicable
provisions of ERISA and the Code and the regulations and published
interpretations thereunder. No ERISA Event has occurred or is reasonably
expected to occur that, when taken together with all other such ERISA Events,
could reasonably be

<PAGE>

                                                                              29

expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. The present value of all
benefit liabilities under all Plans (based on those assumptions used to fund
each such Plan) did not, as of the last annual valuation date applicable thereto
before the Closing Date, exceed the fair market value of the assets of all Plans
as of such date, and the present value of all benefit liabilities of all
underfunded Plans (based on those assumptions used to fund each such Plan) did
not, as of the last annual valuation dates applicable thereto before the Closing
Date, exceed by more than $280 million the fair market value of the assets of
all such underfunded Plans as of such dates.

     SECTION 3.13.   No Default. Neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary is in
default under or with respect to any of its Contractual Obligations in any
respect that has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect. No Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing.

     SECTION 3.14.   Ownership of Property; Liens; Insurance. The Borrower and
each of its Significant Subsidiaries has title in fee simple to, or a valid
leasehold interest in, all its material real property, and good title to, or a
valid leasehold interest in, all its other material property, and none of such
property is subject to any Lien except as permitted by Section 6.01. The
Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries maintains with financially sound and
reputable insurance companies insurance on all its property in at least such
amounts and against at least such risks (but including in any event public
liability, product liability and business interruption) as are usually insured
against in the same general area by companies engaged in the same or a similar
business, provided that nothing in this Section 3.14 shall preclude the Borrower
or any Subsidiary from being self-insured (to the extent deemed prudent by the
Borrower or such Subsidiary and customary with companies in the same or similar
business).

     SECTION 3.15.   Intellectual Property. The Borrower and each of its
Subsidiaries owns, is licensed to use or otherwise has the right to use all
Intellectual Property necessary for the conduct of its business as currently
conducted, except where the failure of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries to have
any such rights has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect. To the knowledge of the Borrower, no material claim that would
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect if adversely decided,
has been asserted and is currently active and pending by any person (i) alleging
that the business of the Borrower or its Subsidiaries as currently conducted
infringes the Intellectual Property rights of a third party or (ii) challenging
or questioning the use of any Intellectual Property of the Borrower or its
Subsidiaries or the validity or effectiveness of any Intellectual Property of
the Borrower or its Subsidiaries. Except for such activities as may be subject
to authorization and consent pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Section 1498 or substantially
equivalent law or regulation, to the Borrower's knowledge, the operation of the
businesses of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries as currently conducted do not
infringe any valid and enforceable Intellectual Property rights of any third
party where a finding of such infringement would reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect.

     SECTION 3.16.   Labor Matters. Except as, in the aggregate, has not had or
would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect: (a) there
are no strikes or other labor disputes against the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries pending or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened; (b) hours
worked by and payment made to employees of the Borrower and each of its
Subsidiaries have not been in violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act or any
other applicable law or regulation dealing with such matters; and (c) all
payments due from the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries on account of employee
health and welfare insurance have been paid or accrued as a liability on the
books of the Borrower or the relevant Subsidiary, as applicable.

     SECTION 3.17.   Environmental Matters. Except as, in the aggregate, has not
had or would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect:

<PAGE>

                                                                              30

     (a)  the facilities and properties owned, leased or operated by the
Borrower or any Subsidiary (the "Properties") do not contain, and have not
previously contained, any Materials of Environmental Concern in amounts or
concentrations or under circumstances that constitute or constituted a violation
of, or could give rise to liability under, any Environmental Law;

     (b)  neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary has received or is aware of
any notice of violation, alleged violation, non-compliance, liability or
potential liability regarding environmental matters or compliance with
Environmental Laws with regard to any of the Properties or the business operated
by the Borrower or any Subsidiary (the "Business"), nor does any Responsible
Officer of the Borrower have actual knowledge or a reasonable basis to believe
that any such notice will be received or is being threatened;

     (c)  Materials of Environmental Concern have not been transported or
disposed of from the Properties in violation of, or in a manner or to a location
that could give rise to liability under, any Environmental Law, nor have any
Materials of Environmental Concern been generated, treated, stored or disposed
of at, on or under any of the Properties in violation of, or in a manner that
could give rise to liability under, any applicable Environmental Law;

     (d)  no judicial proceeding or governmental or administrative action is
pending or, to the knowledge of any Responsible Officer of the Borrower,
threatened, under any Environmental Law to which the Borrower or any Subsidiary
is or will be named as a party with respect to the Properties or the Business,
nor are there any consent decrees or other decrees, consent orders,
administrative orders or other orders, or other administrative or judicial
requirements outstanding under any Environmental Law with respect to the
Properties or the Business;

     (e)  there has been no release or threat of release of Materials of
Environmental Concern at or from the Properties, or arising from or related to
the operations of the Borrower or any Subsidiary in connection with the
Properties or otherwise in connection with the Business, in violation of or in
amounts or in a manner that could give rise to liability under Environmental
Laws;

     (f)  the Properties and all operations at the Properties are in compliance,
and have in the last five years been in compliance, with all applicable
Environmental Laws, and there is no contamination at, under or about the
Properties or violation of any Environmental Law with respect to the Properties
or the Business; and

     (g)  neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary has assumed any liability of
any other person under Environmental Laws.

     SECTION 3.18.   Solvency. The Borrower is, and after giving effect to the
incurrence of all Indebtedness and obligations being incurred in connection
herewith will be and will continue to be, Solvent.

                                   ARTICLE IV

                     Conditions Of Effectiveness and Lending

Agreement shall remain in effect and until the Commitments have been terminated

<PAGE>

                                                                              33

     SECTION 5.01.   Existence; Businesses and Properties. In the case of the
Borrower and the Significant Subsidiaries:

          (a)  do or cause to be done all things necessary to preserve and keep
     in full force and effect its corporate existence, rights and franchises,
     except as otherwise expressly permitted under Section 6.03;

          (b)  comply in all material respects with all applicable laws, rules,
     regulations and decrees and orders of any Governmental Authority, whether
     now in effect or hereafter enacted; and at all times maintain, preserve and
     protect all property material to the conduct of its business; and

          (c)  comply with all Contractual Obligations except to the extent that
     failure to comply therewith, in the aggregate, has not had or would not
     reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

     SECTION 5.02.   Insurance. Keep its insurable properties adequately
insured at all times by financially sound and reputable insurers; and maintain
such other insurance, to such extent and against such risks, including fire and
other risks insured against by extended coverage, as is customary with companies
in the same or similar businesses, provided that nothing in this Section 5.02
shall preclude the Borrower or any Subsidiary from being self-insured (to the
extent deemed prudent by the Borrower or such Subsidiary and customary with
companies in the same or similar business).

     SECTION 5.03.   Payment of Obligations; Taxes. (a) Pay, discharge or
otherwise satisfy at or before maturity or before they become delinquent, as the
case may be, all its material obligations (which , with respect to payment
obligations, shall be any obligation of $50,000,000 or greater) of whatever
nature, except where the amount or validity thereof is currently being contested
in good faith by appropriate proceedings and adequate reserves with respect
thereto shall, to the extent required by GAAP, have been set aside; and

          (b)  Pay and discharge promptly when due all material taxes,
assessments and governmental charges or levies imposed upon it or upon its
income or profits or in respect of its property, before the same shall become
delinquent or in default, as well as all lawful claims for labor, materials and
supplies or otherwise that, if unpaid, might give rise to a Lien upon such
properties or any part thereof unless and to the extent the same are being
contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and adequate reserves with
respect thereto shall, to the extent required by GAAP, have been set aside.

     SECTION 5.04.   Financial Statements, Reports, etc. In the case of the
Borrower, furnish to the Administrative Agent and each Lender:

          (a)  within 90 days after the end of each fiscal year, a consolidated

     financial condition and results of operations of the Borrower and its
     consolidated Subsidiaries as of and for the fiscal year then ended, all
     audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP or other independent public
     accountants of recognized national standing and accompanied by an opinion
     of such accountants (which shall not be qualified in any material respect)
     to the effect that such consolidated financial statements fairly present
     the financial condition and results of operations of the Borrower and its
     consolidated Subsidiaries, as the case may be, on a consolidated basis in
     accordance with GAAP;

irrevocably authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such actions on behalf
of such Lender or assignee and to exercise such powers as are specifically
delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms and provisions hereof,
together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. The
Administrative Agent is hereby expressly authorized by the Lenders, without

all payments of principal of and interest on the Loans and all other amounts due
to the Lenders hereunder, and promptly to distribute to each Lender its proper
share of each payment so received; (b) to give notice on behalf of each of the
Lenders to the Borrower of any Event of Default specified in this Agreement of
which the Administrative Agent has actual knowledge acquired in connection with

pursuant to this Agreement as received by the Administrative Agent.

     Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its directors, officers,
employees or agents shall be liable as such for any action taken or omitted by
any of them except for its or his own gross negligence or wilful misconduct, or
be responsible for any statement, warranty or representation herein or the
contents of any document delivered in connection herewith, or be required to
ascertain or to make any inquiry concerning the performance or observance by the
Borrower of any of the terms, conditions, covenants or agreements contained in
this Agreement. The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible to the Lenders
for the due execution, genuineness, validity, enforceability or effectiveness of
this Agreement or any other instruments or agreements. The Administrative Agent
shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or refraining from acting, in
accordance with written instructions signed by the Required Lenders (or, when
expressly required hereunder, all the Lenders) and, except as otherwise
specifically provided herein, such instructions and any action or inaction
pursuant thereto shall be binding on all the Lenders. The Administrative Agent
shall, in the absence of knowledge to the contrary, be entitled to rely on any
instrument or document believed by it in good faith to be genuine and correct
and to have been signed or sent by the proper person or persons. Neither the
Administrative Agent nor any of its directors, officers, employees or agents
shall have any responsibility to the Borrower on account of the failure of or
delay in performance or breach by any Lender of any of its obligations hereunder
or to any Lender on account of the failure of or delay in performance or breach
by any other Lender or the Borrower of any of their respective obligations
hereunder or in connection herewith. The Administrative Agent may execute any
and all duties hereunder by or through agents or employees and shall be entitled
to rely upon the advice of

legal counsel selected by it with respect to all matters arising hereunder and
shall not be liable for any action taken or suffered in good faith by it in
accordance with the advice of such counsel.

     The Lenders hereby acknowledge that the Administrative Agent shall be under
no duty to take any discretionary action permitted to be taken by it pursuant to
the provisions of this Agreement unless it shall be requested in writing to do
so by the Required Lenders.

     Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Administrative
Agent as provided below, the Administrative Agent may resign at any time by
notifying the Lenders and the Borrower. Upon any such resignation, the Required
Lenders shall have the right, with the consent of the Borrower (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld), to appoint a successor. If no successor
shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted
such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives
notice of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf
of the Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent which shall be a bank
with an office in New York, New York, having a combined capital and surplus of
at least $500,000,000 or an Affiliate of any such bank. Upon the acceptance of
any appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor bank, such
successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers,
privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent and the retiring
Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations
hereunder. After the Administrative Agent's resignation hereunder, the
provisions of this Article and Section 10.05 shall continue in effect for its
benefit in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it
was acting as Administrative Agent.

     With respect to the Loans made by it hereunder, the Administrative Agent in
its individual capacity and not as Administrative Agent shall have the same
rights and powers as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it
were not the Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent and its
Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to and generally engage in any
kind of business with the Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof
as if it were not the Administrative Agent.

     Each Lender agrees (a) to reimburse the Administrative Agent, on demand, in
the amount of its pro rata share (based on its Commitment hereunder) of any
expenses incurred for the benefit of the Lenders by the Administrative Agent,
including counsel fees, that shall not have been reimbursed by the Borrower and
(b) to indemnify and hold harmless the Administrative Agent and any of its
directors, officers, employees or agents, on demand, in the amount of such pro
rata share, from and against any and all liabilities, taxes, obligations,
losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or
disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever that may be imposed on, incurred
by or asserted against it in its capacity as the Administrative Agent or any of
them in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any action taken
or omitted by it or any of them under this Agreement, to the extent the same
shall not have been reimbursed by the Borrower, provided that no Lender shall be
liable to the Administrative Agent or any such other indemnified person for any
portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions,
judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from the gross
negligence or wilful misconduct of the Administrative Agent or any of its
directors, officers, employees or agents.

     Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance
upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents
and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and
decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it
will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any
other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall from time
to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not
taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any related agreement or any
document furnished hereunder. Each Lender further acknowledges that (i)

                                                                              42

the Syndication Agent and the Documentation Agents have no duties or obligations
as such under this Agreement and (ii) with respect to its Loans made or renewed
by it, the Syndication Agent and each Documentation Agent shall have the same
rights and powers under this Agreement as any Lender and may exercise the same
as though it were not an Agent, and the terms "Lender" and "Lenders" shall
include the Syndication Agent and each Documentation Agent in its individual
capacity.

                                   ARTICLE IX

                                    Guarantee

     In order to induce the Lenders to extend credit hereunder and in
consideration therefor, each Guarantor hereby, jointly and severally,
unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees, as a primary obligor and not merely
as a surety, the Obligations. Each Guarantor further agrees that the Obligations
may be extended or renewed, in whole or in part, without notice to or further
assent from it, and that it will remain bound upon its Guarantee hereunder
notwithstanding any such extension or renewal of any Obligation.

     Each Guarantor waives presentment to, demand of payment from and protest to
the Borrower of any of the Obligations, and also waives notice of acceptance of
its obligations and notice of protest for nonpayment. The obligations of each
Guarantor hereunder shall not be affected by the failure of any Lender or the
Administrative Agent to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or
remedy against the Borrower under the provisions of this Agreement or otherwise,
or, except as specifically provided therein, by any rescission, waiver,
amendment or modification of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement or
any other agreement.

     Each Guarantor further agrees that its Guarantee hereunder constitutes a
promise of payment when due and not merely of collection, and waives any right
to require that any resort be had by any Lender to any balance of any deposit
account or credit on the books of any Lender in favor of the Borrower or any
other person.

     The obligations of either Guarantor hereunder shall not be subject to any
reduction, limitation, impairment or termination for any reason, and shall not
be subject to any defense or setoff, counterclaim, recoupment or termination
whatsoever, by reason of the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of the
Obligations, any impossibility in the performance of the Obligations or
otherwise. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the obligations of
either Guarantor hereunder shall not be discharged or impaired or otherwise
affected by the failure of the Administrative Agent or any Lender to assert any
claim or demand or to enforce any remedy under this Agreement or any other
agreement, by any waiver or modification in respect of any thereof, by any
default, failure or delay, wilful or otherwise, in the performance of the
Obligations, or by any other act or omission which may or might in any manner or
to any extent vary the risk of either Guarantor or otherwise operate as a
discharge of either Guarantor as a matter of law or equity.

     Each Guarantor further agrees that its obligations hereunder shall continue
to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or
any part thereof, of principal of or interest on any Obligation is rescinded or
must otherwise be restored by the Administrative Agent or any Lender upon the
bankruptcy or reorganization of the Borrower or otherwise.

     In furtherance of the foregoing and not in limitation of any other right
which the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have at law or in equity
against either Guarantor by virtue hereof, upon the failure of the Borrower to
pay any Obligation when and as the same shall become due, whether at maturity,
by acceleration, after notice of prepayment or otherwise, each Guarantor hereby
promises to and

<PAGE>

                                                                              43

will, upon receipt of written demand by the Administrative Agent, forthwith pay,
or cause to be paid, in immediately available Dollars the amount of such unpaid
Obligation.

     Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the maximum liability of
each Guarantor hereunder shall in no event exceed the amount which can be
guaranteed by such Guarantor under applicable federal and state laws relating to
the insolvency of debtors (after giving effect to the right of contribution
established in the paragraph below).

     Each Guarantor hereby agrees that to the extent that either Guarantor shall
have paid more than its proportionate share of any payment made hereunder, such
Guarantor shall be entitled to seek and receive contribution from and against
the other Guarantor hereunder which has not paid its proportionate share of such
payment. Each Guarantor's right of contribution shall be subject to the terms
and conditions of the following paragraph. The provisions of this paragraph
shall in no respect limit the obligations and liabilities of either Guarantor to
the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, and each Guarantor shall remain liable
to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders for the full amount guaranteed by
such Guarantor hereunder.

     Upon payment by either Guarantor of any sums as provided above, all rights
of either Guarantor against the Borrower arising as a result thereof by way of
subrogation or otherwise shall in all respects be subordinated and junior in
right of payment to the prior indefeasible payment in full of all the
Obligations.

                                    ARTICLE X

                                                                              44

     SECTION 10.02.  Survival of Agreement. All covenants, agreements,
representations and warranties made by the Borrower herein and in the
certificates or other instruments prepared or delivered in connection with or
pursuant to this Agreement shall be considered to have been relied upon by the
Lenders and shall survive the making by the Lenders of the Loans, regardless of
any investigation made by the Lenders or on their behalf, and shall continue in
full force and effect as long as the principal of or any accrued interest on any
Loan or any Fee or any other amount payable under this Agreement is outstanding
and unpaid and so long as the Commitments have not been terminated. The
provisions of Sections 2.13, 2.15, 2.19 and 10.05 shall remain operative and in
full force and effect regardless of the expiration of the term of this
Agreement, the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the
repayment of any of the Loans, the expiration of the Commitments, the invalidity
or unenforceability of any term or provision of this Agreement, or any
investigation made by or on behalf of the Administrative Agent or any Lender.

     SECTION 10.03.  Binding Effect. This Agreement shall become effective when
it shall have been executed by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent and
when the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof which,
when taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties hereto,
and thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties
hereto and their respective permitted successors and assigns.

     SECTION 10.04.  Successors and Assigns. (a) Whenever in this Agreement any
of the parties hereto is referred to, such reference shall be deemed to include
the permitted successors and assigns of such party; and all covenants, promises
and agreements by or on behalf of the Borrower, the Administrative Agent or the
Lenders that are contained in this Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit
of their respective successors and assigns.

     (b)  Each Lender may assign to one or more assignees all or a portion of
its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a
portion of its Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it); provided,
however, that (i) except in the case of an assignment to a Lender or a Lender
Affiliate, (x) the Administrative Agent and (unless an Event of Default shall
have occurred and be continuing) the Borrower must give their prior written
consent to such assignment (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld)
and (y) unless the Borrower and the Administrative Agent shall otherwise agree
to a lower dollar amount, the amount of the Commitment of the assigning Lender
subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and
Acceptance with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative
Agent) shall not be less than $10,000,000 (or the entire remaining amount of the
assigning Lender's Commitment), unless such Lender is making a substantially
simultaneous assignment to the same assignee pursuant to Section 10.04(b) of the
Five-Year Credit Agreement in which case the aggregate of the amount of the
Commitment of the assigning Lender subject to the assignment under this
Agreement and the amount of the commitment of the assigning Lender subject to
the assignment under the Five-Year Credit Agreement shall not be less than
$10,000,000, (ii) the parties to each such assignment shall execute and deliver
to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Acceptance, together with a
processing and recordation fee of $3,500 and (iii) the assignee, if it shall not
be a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an Administrative
Questionnaire. Upon acceptance and recording pursuant to paragraph (e) of this
Section 10.04, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment
and Acceptance, which effective date shall be at least five Business Days after
the execution thereof, (A) the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and,
to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance, have
the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement and (B) the
assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by
such Assignment and Acceptance, be released from its obligations under this
Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering all or the
remaining portion of an assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this
Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be
entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.13, 2.15, 2.19 and 10.05, as well as to

<PAGE>

                                                                              45

any Fees accrued for its account and not yet paid). Any assignment by a Lender
of rights and/or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this
paragraph shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such
Lender of a participation in such rights and/or obligations, as the case may be,
in accordance with paragraph (f) of this Section 10.04.

     (c)  By executing and delivering an Assignment and Acceptance, the
assigning Lender thereunder and the assignee thereunder shall be deemed to
confirm to and agree with each other and the other parties hereto as follows:
(i) such assigning Lender warrants that it is the legal and beneficial owner of
the interest being assigned thereby free and clear of any adverse claim and that
its Commitment, and the outstanding balances of its Revolving Loans and
Competitive Loans, in each case without giving effect to assignments thereof
which have not become effective, are as set forth in such Assignment and
Acceptance, (ii) except as set forth in (i) above, such assigning Lender makes
no representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to any
statements, warranties or representations made in or in connection with this
Agreement, or the execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness,
sufficiency or value of this Agreement or any other instrument or document
furnished pursuant hereto, or the financial condition of the Borrower or any
Subsidiary or the performance or observance by the Borrower or any Subsidiary of
any of its obligations under this Agreement or any other instrument or document
furnished pursuant hereto; (iii) such assignee represents and warrants that it
is legally authorized to enter into such Assignment and Acceptance; (iv) such
assignee confirms that it has received a copy of this Agreement, together with
copies of the most recent financial statements referred to in Section 3.05 or
delivered pursuant to Section 5.04 and such other documents and information as
it has deemed appropriate to make its own credit analysis and decision to enter
into such Assignment and Acceptance; (v) such assignee will independently and
without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, such assigning Lender or any
other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall deem
appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or
not taking action under this Agreement; (vi) such assignee appoints and
authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such action as agent on its behalf
and to exercise such powers under this Agreement as are delegated to the
Administrative Agent by the terms hereof, together with such powers as are
reasonably incidental thereto; and (vii) such assignee agrees that it will
perform in accordance with their terms all the obligations which by the terms of
this Agreement are required to be performed by it as a Lender.

     (d)  The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as an agent of the
Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices in The City of New York a copy of
each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to it and a register for the
recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitment of,
and principal amount of the Loans owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms
hereof from time to time (the "Register"). The Borrower, the Administrative
Agent and the Lenders may treat each person whose name is recorded in the
Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of
this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary, and such entries in the
Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Register shall be
available for inspection by the Borrower and any Lender, at any reasonable time
and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

     (e)  Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Acceptance
executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, an Administrative Questionnaire
completed in respect of the assignee (unless the assignee shall already be a
Lender hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to in paragraph
(b) above and, if required, the written consent of the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent to such assignment, the Administrative Agent shall (i)
accept such Assignment and Acceptance, (ii) record the information contained
therein in the Register and (iii) give prompt notice thereof to the Lenders and
the Borrower. No assignment shall be effective unless it has been recorded in
the Register as provided in this paragraph (e).

                                                                              46

     (f)  Each Lender may without the consent of the Borrower or the
Administrative Agent sell participations to one or more banks or other entities
in all or a portion of its rights and/or obligations under this Agreement
(including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans owing to it);
provided, however, that (i) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement shall
remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other
parties hereto for the performance of such obligations, (iii) the participating
banks or other entities shall be entitled to the benefit of the cost protection
provisions contained in Sections 2.13, 2.15 and 2.19 (and shall have the duty to
mitigate under Section 2.20) to the same extent as if they were Lenders
(provided, that unless such participation was consented to by the Borrower, each
participating bank or other entity shall only be entitled to the benefit of the
cost protection provisions contained in Sections 2.13, 2.15 and 2.19 to the same
extent as its participating Lender) and (iv) the Borrower, the Administrative
Agent and the Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such
Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this
Agreement, and such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce the
obligations of the Borrower relating to the Loans and to approve any amendment,
modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement (other than
amendments, modifications or waivers decreasing any fees payable hereunder or
the amount of principal of or the rate at which interest is payable on the
Loans, extending any scheduled principal payment date or date fixed for the
payment of interest on the Loans or increasing or extending the Commitments).

     (g)  Any Lender or participant may, in connection with any assignment or
participation or proposed assignment or participation pursuant to this Section
10.04, disclose to the assignee or participant or proposed assignee or
participant any information relating to the Borrower furnished to such Lender by
or on behalf of the Borrower; provided that, prior to any such disclosure of
information designated by the Borrower as confidential, "Company Private" or
"Proprietary", each such assignee or participant or proposed assignee or
participant shall execute an agreement whereby such assignee or participant
shall agree (subject to customary exceptions) to preserve the confidentiality of
such confidential information on terms no less restrictive than those applicable
to the Lenders pursuant to Section 10.16.

     (h)  Any Lender may at any time assign all or any portion of its rights
under this Agreement to a Federal Reserve Bank without the consent of the
Borrower or the Administrative Agent to secure extensions of credit by such
Federal Reserve Bank to such Lender; provided that no such assignment shall
release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such
Bank for such Lender as a party hereto. In order to facilitate such an
assignment to a Federal Reserve Bank, the Borrower shall, at the request of the
assigning Lender, duly execute and deliver to the assigning Lender a promissory
note or notes evidencing the Loans made to the Borrower by the assigning Lender
hereunder.

     (i)  The Borrower shall not assign or delegate any of its rights or duties
hereunder without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent and each
Lender, and any attempted assignment without such consent shall be null and
void.

     (j)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any Lender
(a "Granting Lender") may grant to a special purpose funding vehicle (an "SPC")
of such Granting Lender, identified as such in writing from time to time by the
Granting Lender to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, the option to
provide to the Borrower all or any part of any Loan that such Granting Lender
would otherwise be obligated to make to the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.01 or
2.03(e), provided that (i) nothing herein shall constitute a commitment to make
any Loan by any SPC and (ii) if an SPC elects not to exercise such option or
otherwise fails to provide all or any part of such Loan, the Granting Lender
shall be obligated to make such Loan pursuant to the terms hereof. The making of
a Loan by an SPC hereunder shall utilize the Commitment of the Granting Lender
(and, if such Loan is a Competitive Loan, shall be deemed to utilize the
Commitments of all the Lenders) to the same extent, and as if, such Loan were
made by the Granting Lender. Each party hereto hereby agrees that no SPC shall
be liable for any indemnity or similar payment obligation under this Agreement
(all liability for which shall remain with

<PAGE>

                                                                              47

the related Granting Lender). In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereto
hereby agrees (which agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement)
that, prior to the date that is one year and one day after the payment in full
of all outstanding senior indebtedness of any SPC, it will not institute
against, or join any other person in instituting against, such SPC any
bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation proceedings
or similar proceedings under the laws of the United States or any State thereof.
In addition, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section
10.04 or in Section 10.16, any SPC may (i) with notice to, but without the prior
written consent of, the Borrower or the Administrative Agent and without paying
any processing fee therefor, assign all or a portion of its interests in any
Loans to its Granting Lender or to any financial institutions providing
liquidity and/or credit facilities to or for the account of such SPC to fund the
Loans made by such SPC or to support the securities (if any) issued by such SPC
to fund such Loans and (ii) disclose on a confidential basis any non-public
information relating to its Loans to any rating agency, commercial paper dealer
or provider of a surety, guarantee or credit or liquidity enhancement to such
SPC.

     SECTION 10.05.  Expenses; Indemnity. (a) The Borrower agrees (i) to pay all
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Agents and the Arrangers in
connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein and
the preparation and administration of this Agreement or in connection with any
amendments, modifications or waivers of the provisions hereof (whether or not
the transactions hereby or thereby contemplated shall be consummated), including
the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of Simpson Thacher & Bartlett,
counsel for the Agents and (ii) to pay all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by
any Agent, either Arranger or any Lender in connection with the enforcement or
protection of its rights in connection with this Agreement or in connection with
the Loans made hereunder, including the fees, charges and disbursements of
Simpson Thacher & Bartlett, counsel for the Agents, and, in connection with any
such enforcement or protection, the fees, charges and disbursements of any other
counsel (including the allocated charges of in-house counsel) for any Agent or
any Lender. The Borrower shall not be obligated to reimburse out-of-pocket legal
expenses pursuant to the preceding sentence for more than one law firm for the
Agents incurred in connection with the preparation of this Agreement or in
connection with any particular amendment, modification or waiver of the
provisions hereof.

     (b)  The Borrower agrees to indemnify each Agent, each Arranger and each
Lender, each Affiliate of any of the foregoing persons and each of their
respective directors, officers, employees, advisors and agents (each such person
being called an "Indemnitee") against, and to hold each Indemnitee harmless
from, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses,
including reasonable counsel fees, charges and disbursements, incurred by or
asserted against any Indemnitee arising out of, in any way connected with, or as
a result of (i) the execution or delivery of this Agreement or any agreement or
instrument contemplated thereby, the performance by the parties thereto of their
respective obligations thereunder or the consummation of the Transactions and
the other transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) the use of the proceeds of the
Loans or (iii) any claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to
any of the foregoing, whether or not any Indemnitee is a party thereto; provided
that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent
that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses result from
the gross negligence or wilful misconduct of such Indemnitee.

     (c)  The provisions of this Section 10.05 shall remain operative and in
full force and effect regardless of the expiration of the term of this
Agreement, the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the
repayment of any of the Loans, the expiration of the Commitments, the invalidity
or unenforceability of any term or provision of this Agreement, or any
investigation made by or on behalf of any Agent or any Lender. All amounts due
under this Section 10.05 shall be payable on written demand therefor.

     SECTION 10.06.  Right of Setoff. If an Event of Default shall have occurred
and be continuing, each Lender is hereby authorized at any time and from time to
time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all
deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time
held and other indebtedness at any time owing by such Lender or any affiliate,
branch or agency thereof to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower
against any of and all the obligations of the Borrower now or hereafter existing
under this Agreement held by such Lender, irrespective of whether or not such
Lender shall have made any demand under this Agreement and although such
obligations may be unmatured. The rights of each Lender under this Section are
in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff)
which such Lender may have.

     SECTION 10.07.  APPLICABLE LAW. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH AND GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

     SECTION 10.08.  Waivers; Amendment. (a) No failure or delay of the
Administrative Agent or any Lender in exercising any power or right hereunder
shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of
any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to
enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or
the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders hereunder are cumulative and are not
exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of
any provision of this Agreement or consent to any departure by the Borrower
therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by
paragraph (b) below, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in
the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. No notice or demand
on the Borrower in any case shall entitle the Borrower to any other or further
notice or demand in similar or other circumstances.

     (b)  Neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof may be waived, amended
or modified except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered
into by the Borrower and the Required Lenders; provided, however, that no such
agreement shall (i) decrease the principal amount of, or extend the maturity of
or any scheduled principal payment date or date for the payment of any interest
on any Loan or the payment of any Facility Fee, or waive or excuse any such
payment or any part thereof, or decrease the rate of interest on any Loan,
without the prior written consent of each Lender affected thereby, (ii) change
or extend the Commitment or decrease the Facility Fees or Utilization Fees of
any Lender without the prior written consent of such Lender, (iii) except in

of the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions.

     SECTION 10.13.  Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in

and each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees
that all claims in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and

this Agreement against the Borrower or its properties in the courts of any
jurisdiction.

court. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest
extent permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance
of such action or proceeding in any such court.

     (c)  Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of
