<p align="center"><b><u><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">AND GENERAL RELEASE OF CLAIMS</font></u></b></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Separation Agreement and General Release of Claims (the &#147;Agreement&#148;) is entered into between Roland Buelow
(&#147;Buelow&#148;) and SangStat Medical Corporation(&#147;the Company&#148;) effective as of November 8, 2002 (the &#147;Effective Date&#148;).&nbsp; Buelow is currently employed by the Company as its Senior Vice President, Discovery Research.&nbsp; Buelow
and the Company are parties to a Change in Control Agreement dated December 20, 2000 (the &#147;Change in Control Agreement&#148;).&nbsp; In addition, the Company granted Buelow options to purchase shares of the Company&#146;s common stock and in particular, the
Company granted Buelow an option on June 30, 1999 to purchase 4000 shares of Company stock (the &#147;6-30-99 Stock Option&#148;).</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buelow has requested a change in his employment status whereby Buelow would become a part-time employee of the Company until May 31,
2003 (the &#147;Completion Date&#148;) and as of the Completion Date, Buelow&#146;s employment with the Company would be terminated.&nbsp; Buelow&#146;s request has been made in order for him to pursue research and development activities with Therapeutic Human
Polyclonals, Inc. (&#147;THP&#148;) in the following areas (the &#147;THP Area&#148;): (i) development and engineering of transgenic animals and transgenic cells capable of producing or making substantially human antibodies and immunoglobin preparations
(&#147;HAbs&#148;); (ii) making (including animal husbandry, animal immunization, antigen preparation, collection of fluids and tissues and culturing of cells) of&nbsp; HAbs from such transgenic animals/cells; and (iii) the&nbsp; production, purification,
processing and packaging of such Habs. The Company contemplates and believes it will be entering into a business relationship with THP; therefore, in light of Buelow&#146;s service to the Company and in order to further mutually agreeable goals, and in exchange for
the release of claims set forth in paragraphs 6, 7 and 8 below, the Company has agreed to accept Buelow&#146;s request and will provide Buelow with the following benefits beginning on the Effective Date and Buelow has agreed to provide the Company the consideration
described herein.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of the Effective Date, Buelow will step down from his current full-time position and become a part-time employee of the Company
assuming the duties of a Senior Research Fellow reporting to the Vice President of Discovery Research.&nbsp; As of the Effective Date, Mr. Buelow will no longer be an officer of the Company.&nbsp; As a Senior Research Fellow, Buelow&#146;s responsibilities shall
include part-time, on-site support of the Company&#146;s research and development programs, provided that Buelow shall perform no duties and shall not participate in any work related to the THP Area, for the Company.&nbsp; Buelow agrees to remain an active employee
of the Company through May 31, 2003 (the &#147;Completion Date&#148;), subject to the provisions set in this Agreement.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) From the Effective Date through December 31, 2002, Buelow will work on a 40% basis (two days per week or not more than sixteen
hours per week) and as of January 1, 2003 through May 31, 2003, Buelow will work on a 20% basis (one day per week or not more than eight hours per week).&nbsp; Buelow&#146;s current base salary (as of the Effective Date) will be adjusted pro rata for the reduction
in his work status from full-time to part-time.&nbsp; Buelow will not be entitled to any salary increases or cost of living adjustments, which may be available to other Company employees.&nbsp; In addition, Buelow will not be entitled to any bonus, which may be
available to other Company employees except as specifically provided below.</font></p>

</font>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp; Due to the reduction in Buelow&#146;s work hours, as of the Effective Date he shall no longer be entitled to
participate in the Company&#146;s group health insurance plan.&nbsp; However, he shall be entitled to elect to continue his group health insurance coverage in accordance with federal law (COBRA).&nbsp; He shall be entitled to participate in the other
Company-sponsored group health plans to the extent those plans provide for coverage for less than full-time employees of the Company.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp; As of the Effective Date, Buelow and the Company agree that the Change in Control Agreement is
terminated.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp; As a result of Buelow&#146;s dual employment with the Company and THP, Buelow agrees that he shall not disclose
to the Company any confidential information or know-how of THP, except as provided for in agreements between THP and the Company and as agreed to by THP and further, Buelow shall not use or disclose any of the Company&#146;s confidential information or know-how in
his work at THP except as agreed to by the Company.&nbsp; Subject to strict compliance with this Agreement and the Proprietary Information and Inventions Agreement dated February 15, 1993 (the &#147;Inventions Agreement&#148;), the Company agrees that THP&#146;s
employment of Buelow will not violate any term of Buelow&#146;s employment with the Company and that the Company&#146;s right or interest in any invention or other intellectual property created by Buelow in his role as a part-time employee working for the Company
after the Effective Date shall be strictly limited to those inventions and other intellectual property arising from his work for the Company and not to those inventions which relate to the THP Area.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp; Buelow and the Company agree that all work Buelow might perform on behalf of THP in the THP Area and all work
Buelow might perform on behalf of the Company do not overlap in their technical scope.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retention of Incentives.&nbsp; The Company agrees to pay to and provide Buelow with the following benefits:</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a) If, as of the Completion Date, Buelow satisfies the following two items, the vesting schedule of the 6-30-99 Stock
Option shall be amended and revised to provide Buelow with full vesting of the 6-30-99 Stock Option as of the Completion Date:</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) Buelow has remained an employee of the Company; and</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) The RDP58 Milestone has been achieved.&nbsp; For purposes of this Agreement, the RDP58
Milestone shall be defined to mean that a preliminary data analysis of data from any RDP58 Phase II clinical trial shows sufficient efficacy in humans at any dose such that, if such data were validated through the quality assurance process, the results reasonably
would justify proceeding with either a Phase IIb or a Phase III clinical trial.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Notwithstanding Buelow&#146;s reduced work schedule and except for the 6-30-99 Stock Option, all of the stock options
granted to him by the Company, shall continue to vest in accordance with their terms through the Completion Date.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Buelow shall receive his portion of the Company&#146;s Corporate Bonus based on his actual salary earned in 2002 (as
reduced hereby) on the same date as all other Company employees (on or about March 15, 2003) (the &#147;Distribution Date&#148;) in accordance with the Company&#146;s firm-</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">2</font></p>

<font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><br clear="all">
</font>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">wide policies concerning its Corporate Bonus program.&nbsp; The amount of Buelow&#146;s Corporate Bonus shall be 21.25% of his actual salary earned in 2002.&nbsp; This amount was calculated on the basis of Buelow&#146;s 100%
achievement of his personal objectives and the average of the Company&#146;s performance factors for the years 1999, 2000 and 2001.&nbsp; In the event the Distribution Date is subsequent to the Completion Date, Buelow shall receive the Corporate Bonus
notwithstanding the fact he is no longer an employee of the Company.&nbsp; However, in the event Buelow&#146;s employment with the Company terminates prior to the Distribution Date and his termination is a Disqualifying Termination (defined herein as (i)
Buelow&#146;s voluntary resignation, or (ii) Buelow&#146;s termination for &#147;cause&#148; as defined in the Change of Control Agreement (terminated above), which definition is incorporated herein for all purposes), then Buelow shall not be entitled to the
Corporate Bonus.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp; If (i) Buelow remains an employee through the Completion Date, and (ii) the RDP58 Milestone is achieved on or
before the Completion Date, and (iii) he has re-signed this Agreement and has not revoked it, then upon the eighth day following his re-signature of this Agreement, Buelow shall receive an additional cash bonus of $25,000, less applicable withholding payable (the
&#147;Separation Bonus&#148;) in a lump sum.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) In the event Buelow&#146;s employment terminates prior to the Completion Date and it is not a Disqualifying Termination
as defined in paragraph 5(c) herein, then:</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) If the RDP58 Milestone has been achieved, then the 6-30-99 Stock
Option shall be amended and revised to provide Buelow with full vesting of the 6-30-99 Stock Option as of Buelow&#146;s termination date and the Separation Bonus will be deemed earned and payable as set forth above.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) If the RDP58 Milestone has not been achieved (so that the 6-30-99
Stock Option does not vest) but the RDP58 Milestone is deemed capable of achievement as determined by the Company in its sole discretion (which discretion shall be commercially reasonable), and provided that he has re-signed this Agreement and has not revoked it,
then Buelow will be entitled to the Separation Bonus payable as set forth above, and an additional cash bonus of $20,000, less applicable withholding payable in a lump sum, payable at the same time as the Separation Bonus.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buelow understands and acknowledges that he shall be entitled to no payments or benefits from the Company other than those expressly set forth in this
Agreement.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In exchange for the benefits described in this Agreement and its Exhibits, Buelow and his successors and assigns hereby and release
the Company and its parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, shareholders, investors, directors, officers, employees, agents, attorneys, insurers, legal successors and assigns (the &#147;Released Parties&#148;) of and from any and all claims, demands, damages, debts,
