                                    GUARANTY

          GUARANTY, dated as of November 14, 2000 (this "GUARANTY"), from

                                    SECTION 2

                                    GUARANTY

          2.1  GUARANTY. Subject to the terms and conditions in this Guaranty,
the Guarantor absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees to the
Lessor and each Assignee that (a) all Payment Obligations will be promptly paid
in full as and when due in accordance with the terms thereof whether at the
stated due date, by acceleration or otherwise, and (b) the Lessee will duly and
punctually perform, comply with and observe all Covenant Obligations as and when
required in accordance with the terms thereof, in each case, without regard to
whether such Obligation is direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, now or
hereafter existing or owing, voluntary or involuntary, created or arising by
contract, operation of law or otherwise or incurred or payable before or after
commencement of any proceedings by or against the Lessee under any Bankruptcy
law.

          If an event permitting the exercise of remedies under the Operative
Documents shall at any time have occurred and be continuing and such exercise,
or any consequences thereof provided in the Operative Documents, shall at such
time be prevented by reason of the pendency against the Lessee of a case or
proceeding under any Bankruptcy law, the Guarantor agrees that, solely for
purposes of this Guaranty and its obligations hereunder, the Obligations and all
other amounts as to which such remedies would have been exercisable under the
Operative Documents in the absence of such case or proceeding shall be deemed to
have been declared in default, with all attendant consequences as provided in
the Operative Documents as if such declaration of default and the consequences
thereof had been accomplished in accordance with the terms of the Operative
Documents, and the Guarantor shall forthwith pay any such amounts guaranteed
hereunder, without further notice or demand.

          2.2  GUARANTY ABSOLUTE. This Guaranty is an absolute, unlimited and
continuing guaranty of performance and payment (and not of collection) of the
Obligations. This Guaranty is in no way conditioned upon any attempt to collect
from the Lessee or upon any other event or contingency, and shall be binding
upon and enforceable against the Guarantor without regard to the validity or
enforceability of any Operative Document, or of any term thereof.

          The obligations of the Guarantor set forth herein constitute the full
recourse obligations of the Guarantor enforceable against it to the full extent
of all its assets and properties, notwithstanding any provision in the Agreement
for Lease or the Lease limiting the liability of any Person, or any agreement by
Assignee to look for payment with respect thereto, solely to certain property
and other collateral as described in the Operative Documents. Without limiting

                                       -2-
<Page>

the foregoing, it is agreed and understood that (a) repeated and successive
demands may be made and recoveries may be had hereunder as and when, from time
to time, the Lessee shall be in default with respect to the Obligations under
the terms of any Operative Document, and (b) notwithstanding the recovery
hereunder for or in respect of any given default with respect to the Obligations
by the Lessee under the Agreement for Lease or the Lease, this Guaranty shall
remain in full force and effect and shall apply to each and every subsequent
default with respect to the Obligations.

          2.3  REINSTATEMENT. In case any Operative Document shall be terminated
as a result of the rejection thereof by any trustee, receiver or liquidating
agent of the Lessee or any of its properties in any Bankruptcy or similar
proceeding, the Guarantor's obligations hereunder shall continue to the same
extent as if such agreement had not been so rejected. The Guarantor agrees that
this Guaranty shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may
be, if at any time payment to the Lessor of the Obligations or any part thereof
is rescinded or must otherwise be returned by the Lessor upon the Bankruptcy of
the Lessee, or otherwise, as though such payment to the Lessor had not been
made.

          2.4  ENFORCEMENT. The Guarantor shall pay all costs, expenses and
damages incurred (including reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements) in
connection with the enforcement of the Obligations to the extent that such
costs, expenses and damages are not paid by the Lessee, and in connection with
the enforcement of the obligations of the Guarantor under this Guaranty.

          2.5  GUARANTY NOT SUBJECT TO SETOFF, ETC. The obligations of the
Guarantor hereunder shall not be subject to any counterclaim, setoff, deduction
or defense based upon any claim the Guarantor or the Lessee may have against the
Lessor or any claim the Guarantor may have against the Lessee or any other
Person and shall remain in full force and effect without regard to, and shall
not be released, discharged, reduced or in any way affected by any circumstance
or condition whatsoever (whether or not the Guarantor shall have any knowledge
or notice thereof) which might constitute a legal or equitable discharge or
defense including, but not limited to, (a) the amending, modifying,
supplementing or terminating (by operation of law or otherwise), expressly or
impliedly, of any Operative Document, or any other instrument applicable to the
Lessee or to its Obligations, or any part thereof; (b) any failure on the part
of the Lessee to perform or comply with any term of any Operative Document or
any failure of any other Person to perform or comply with any term of any
Operative Document; (c) any waiver, consent, change, extension, indulgence or
other action or any action or inaction under or in respect of any Operative
Document or this Guaranty, whether or not the Lessor, the Lessee or the
Guarantor has notice or knowledge of any of the foregoing; (d) any Bankruptcy or
similar proceeding with respect to the Lessor, the Guarantor or the Lessee, or
their respective properties or their creditors, or any action taken by any
trustee or receiver or by any court in any such proceeding; (e) any furnishing
or acceptance of additional security or any release of any security (and the
Guarantor authorizes the Lessor to furnish, accept or release said security);
(f) any limitation on the liability or Obligations of the Lessee under any
Operative Document (except as expressly set forth therein) or any termination
(by operation of law or otherwise), cancellation (by operation of law or
otherwise), frustration or unenforceability, in whole or in part, of any
Operative Document, or any term thereof; (g) any lien, charge or encumbrance on
or affecting the Guarantor's, the Lessor's or the Lessee's respective assets and
properties; (h) any act, omission or breach on the part of the Lessor or
Assignee under any Operative Document, or any other agreement at any

                                       -3-
<Page>

time existing between the Lessor and the Lessee or any other law, governmental
regulation or other agreement applicable to the Lessor or any Obligation; (i)
any claim as a result of any other dealings among the Lessor, any Assignee, the
Guarantor or any of them; (j) the assignment or transfer of this Guaranty, any
Operative Document (whether or not in accordance with and subject to the terms
thereof) or any other agreement or instrument referred to in any Operative
Document or applicable to the Lessee or the Obligations by the Lessor to any
other Person; (k) any change in the name of the Lessor, Assignee, the Lessee or
any other Person; (l) any subleasing or further subleasing of the Project or any
part thereof, or any redelivery, repossession, sale, transfer or other
disposition, surrender or destruction of the Project or any part thereof; (m)
the transfer, assignment, mortgaging or purported transfer, assignment or
mortgaging of all or any part of the interest of the Lessor, its successors or
assigns, or the Lessee in the Project; (n) any failure of title with respect to
the interest of the Lessor or the Lessee, or their respective successors and
assigns, in the Project; (o) any defect in the compliance with specifications,
condition, design, operation or fitness for use of, or any damage to or loss or
destruction of, or any interruption or cessation in the use of or failure to
complete, the Project or any portion thereof by the Lessee or any other Person
for any reason whatsoever (including, without limitation, any governmental
prohibition or restriction, condemnation, requisition, seizure or any other act
on the part of any governmental or military authority, or any act of God or of
the public enemy, or any Event of Loss), and regardless of the duration thereof
(even though such duration would otherwise constitute a frustration of the
Lease), whether or not without fault on the part of the Lessee or any other
Person; (p) any merger or consolidation of the Lessee or the Guarantor into or
with any other Person or any direct or indirect sale, lease or transfer of any
other assets of the Lessee or the Guarantor to any other Person; (q) any change
in the ownership of any shares of capital stock or other equity interests of the
Guarantor or the Lessee (including any such change which results in the
Guarantor no longer owning (directly or indirectly) capital stock of the
Lessee); or (r) any other event or circumstance whatsoever (other than payment
and performance in full of the Obligations).

          2.6  WAIVER. The Guarantor unconditionally waives: (a) notice of any
of the matters referred to in Section 2 hereof; (b) all notices which may be
required by statute, rule of law or otherwise to preserve any rights against the
Guarantor hereunder, including notice of the acceptance of this Guaranty by the
Lessor or Assignee, or the creation, renewal, extension, modification or accrual
of the Obligations or notice of any other matters relating thereto, any
presentment, demand, notice of dishonor, protest or nonpayment of any damages or
other amounts payable under any Operative Document; (c) any requirement for the
enforcement, assertion or exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege
under or in respect of any Operative Document, including diligence in collection
or protection of or realization upon the Obligations or any part thereof or any
collateral therefor; (d) any requirement of diligence; (e) any requirement to
mitigate the damages resulting from a default or other termination under any
Operative Document, except that this shall not relieve the Lessor or such
Assignee of any such obligation; (f) the occurrence of every other condition
precedent to which the Guarantor or the Lessee may otherwise be entitled, except
as provided in any Operative Document; and (g) the right to require the Lessor
or such Assignee to proceed against the Lessee or any other Person liable on the
Obligations, to proceed against or exhaust security held from the Lessee or any
other Person, or to pursue any other remedy in the Lessor's power whatsoever,
and the Guarantor waives the right to have the property of the Lessee first
applied to the discharge of the Obligations.

                                       -4-
<Page>

          The Lessor or Assignee may, at its election, exercise any right or
remedy it might have against the Lessee or any security held by the Lessor or
such Assignee, including the right to foreclose upon any such security by
judicial or nonjudicial sale, without affecting or impairing in any way the
liability of the Guarantor hereunder, except to the extent the Obligations have
been paid or satisfied, and the Guarantor waives any defense arising out of the
absence, impairment or loss of any right of reimbursement, contribution or
subrogation or any other right or remedy of the Guarantor against the Lessee or
any such security, whether resulting from such election by the Lessor or such
Assignee or otherwise. The Guarantor waives any defense arising by reason of any
disability or other defense of the Lessee, or by reason of the cessation from
any cause whatsoever of the liability, either in whole or in part, of the Lessee
to the Lessor or Assignee for the Obligations.

          The Guarantor understands that the Lessor's or Assignee's exercise of
certain rights and remedies contained in the Operative Documents may affect or
eliminate the Guarantor's rights of subrogation against the Lessee and that the
Guarantor may therefore incur partially or totally nonreimbursable liability
hereunder; nevertheless, the Guarantor hereby authorizes and empowers the Lessor
and each Assignee, to exercise in its or their sole discretion, any rights and
remedies, or any combination thereof, which may then be available, it being the
purpose and intent of the Guarantor that its obligations hereunder shall be
absolute, irrevocable, independent and unconditional under any and all
circumstances.

          The Guarantor assumes the responsibility for being and keeping
informed of the financial condition of the Lessee and of all other circumstances
bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of the Obligations and agrees that neither
the Lessor nor Assignee shall have any duty to advise the Guarantor of
information regarding any condition or circumstance or any change in such
condition or circumstance. The Guarantor acknowledges that neither the Lessor
nor Assignee has made any representation to the Guarantor concerning the
financial condition of the Lessee.

                                    SECTION 3

                           COVENANTS OF THE GUARANTOR

          3.1  AFFIRMATIVE COVENANTS. So long as any of the Obligations shall

               the Guarantor and its Consolidated Subsidiaries, for such quarter
               and (in the case of the second and third quarters) for the
               portion of the fiscal year ending with such quarter,

          setting forth in each case in comparative form the figures for the
          corresponding periods in the previous fiscal year, all in reasonable
          detail, prepared in accordance with GAAP applicable to quarterly
          financial statements generally, and certified by a Senior Financial
          Officer as fairly presenting, in all material respects, the financial
          position of the companies being reported on and their results of
          operations and cash flows, subject to changes resulting from year-end
          adjustments, PROVIDED that filing with the SEC of the Guarantor's
          Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q prepared in compliance with the
          requirements therefor shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements of
          this Section 3.1.3(a);

               (b) ANNUAL STATEMENTS -- as soon as available and in any event
          within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year of the Guarantor,

          previous fiscal year, all in reasonable detail, prepared in accordance
          with GAAP, and accompanied by an opinion thereon of independent public
          accountants of recognized national standing, which opinion shall state
          that such financial statements present fairly, in all material
          respects, the financial position of the companies being reported upon
          and their results of operations and cash flows and have been prepared
          in conformity with GAAP, and that the examination of such accountants
          in connection with such financial statements has been made in
          accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, and that such
          audit provides a reasonable basis for such opinion in the
          circumstances, PROVIDED that filing with the SEC of the Guarantor's
          Annual Report on Form 10-K for such fiscal year (together with the

          inquiry, whether there exists on the date of such certificate any
          Potential Default or Event of Default, and if any Potential Default or
          Event of Default exists, specifying the nature and period of existence

               of a trustee to administer, any Plan, or the receipt by the
               Guarantor or any member of the ERISA Group of a notice from a
               Multiemployer Plan that such action has been taken by the PBGC

               taken together with any other such liabilities or Liens then
               existing, will result, directly or indirectly, in a Material
               Adverse Effect; and

          information relates to the ability of the Guarantor to perform its
          obligations under this Guaranty or the Consent and Agreement (as
          defined in the Note Purchase Agreement) of Guarantor or the ability of
          the Lessee to perform its obligations under the Agreement for Lease

then exists, to visit and inspect any of the offices or properties of the
Guarantor, any Material Subsidiary or the Lessee, to discuss their respective
affairs, finances and accounts with their respective officers and independent
public accountants (and by this provision the Guarantor authorizes said
accountants to discuss the affairs, finances and accounts of the Guarantor, its
Material Subsidiaries and the Lessee), all at such times and as often as may be
requested (and subject to the requirement that each such representative sign the
Guarantor's customary confidentiality agreement with respect to any proprietary
information sought to be examined or discussed and compliance with the
Guarantor's or any Material Subsidiary's safety procedures), to the extent that
such examinations and discussions relate to the ability of the Guarantor to
perform its obligations under this Guaranty or the Consent and Agreement (as
defined in the Note Purchase Agreement) of the Guarantor or the ability of the
Lessee to perform its obligations under the Agreement for Lease and the Lease.

               3.1.6  COMPLIANCE WITH LAW. Without limiting the requirements of
Section 2 of the Lease, the Guarantor will and will cause each of its Material
Subsidiaries to comply with all laws, ordinances or governmental rules or
regulations to which each of them is subject, including, without limitation,
Environmental Requirements, except where the necessity of compliance therewith
is contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings or except where the
failure to comply will not result, directly or indirectly, in a Material Adverse
Effect.

               3.1.7  INTENTIONALLY OMITTED.

               3.1.8  MAINTENANCE OF PROPERTIES. Without limiting the
requirements of Section 9 of the Lease, the Guarantor will and will cause each
of its Material Subsidiaries to maintain and keep, or cause to be maintained and
kept, their respective properties in good repair, working order and condition
(other than ordinary wear and tear), so that the business carried on in
connection therewith may be properly conducted at all times, provided that
subject to the provisions of Section 3.1.1 hereof, this Section 3.1.8 shall not
prevent the Guarantor or any Material Subsidiary from disposing of or
discontinuing the operation and maintenance of any of its properties if such
disposition or discontinuance is desirable in the conduct of its business and
the Guarantor has concluded that such disposition or discontinuance will not,
directly or indirectly and individually or in the aggregate, result in a
Material Adverse Effect.

               3.1.9  PAYMENT OF TAXES AND CLAIMS. The Guarantor will and will
cause each of its Material Subsidiaries to file all tax returns required to be
filed in any jurisdiction and to pay and discharge all taxes shown to be due and
payable on such returns and all other taxes, assessments, governmental charges
or levies imposed on them or any of their properties, assets, income or
franchises, to the extent such taxes and assessments have become due and payable
and before they have become delinquent and all claims for which sums have become
due and payable that have or might become a Lien on properties or assets of the
Guarantor or any Material Subsidiary, provided that neither the Guarantor nor
any Material Subsidiary need pay any such tax, assessment, charge, levy or claim
if (a) the amount, applicability or validity thereof is contested by the
Guarantor or such Material Subsidiary on a timely basis in good faith and in
appropriate proceedings, and the Guarantor or a Material Subsidiary has
established adequate reserves therefor in accordance with GAAP on the books of
the Guarantor or such Material

                                       -8-

Subsidiary or (b) the nonpayment of all such taxes, assessments, charges, levies
or claims in the aggregate will not, directly or indirectly, result in a
Material Adverse Effect.

               3.1.10 CORPORATE EXISTENCE, ETC. Subject to Section 3.2.1, the
Guarantor will at all times preserve and keep in full force and effect its
corporate existence. Subject to Section 3.2.1, the Guarantor will at all times
preserve and keep in full force and effect the corporate existence of each of
its Material Subsidiaries and all rights and franchises of the Guarantor and its
Material Subsidiaries unless, in the good faith judgment of the Guarantor, the
termination of or failure to preserve and keep in full force and effect such
corporate existence, right or franchise will not, directly or indirectly and
individually or in the aggregate, result in a Material Adverse Effect.

          3.2  NEGATIVE COVENANTS. So long as any of the Obligations shall
remain outstanding, the Guarantor will not, and will not permit any Material
Subsidiary to:

               3.2.1  MERGERS AND CONSOLIDATIONS. Directly or indirectly merge
into or consolidate with any Person, except that:

               (a) any Material Subsidiary may merge into or consolidate with

                                    SECTION 4

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

          The Guarantor represents and warrants to the Lessor and Assignee that:

          4.1  ORGANIZATION; POWER AND AUTHORITY. The Guarantor is a corporation
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its
state of incorporation, and is duly qualified as a foreign corporation and is in
good standing in each jurisdiction in which such qualification is required by
law, except where the failure to so qualify would not materially impair the
ability of the Guarantor to perform its obligations under this Guaranty.

          4.2  CORPORATE POWER. The Guarantor has full corporate power and
authority to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under this Guaranty
and has taken all necessary corporate action to authorize the execution,
delivery and performance of this Guaranty.

          4.3  AUTHORIZATION, ETC. This Guaranty has been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate and shareholder action on the part of the Guarantor, and
this Guaranty constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Guarantor
enforceable against the Guarantor in accordance with its terms, except as such
enforceability may be limited by (a) applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of
creditors' rights generally and (b) general principles of equity (regardless of
whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

          4.4  DISCLOSURE. The Private Placement Memorandum dated September 2000
(such Private Placement Memorandum (as supplemented by a Supplementary Update on
or about September 21, 2000), together with any documents incorporated therein
by reference, collectively the "MEMORANDUM"), relating to the transactions
contemplated hereby fairly describes, in all material respects, the business and
properties of the Guarantor and its Material Subsidiaries. The Memorandum taken
as a whole does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading
in light of the circumstances under which they were made. Since December 31,
1999, there has been no change in the financial condition, operations, business
or properties of the Guarantor or any Material Subsidiary except (a) changes
that have been disclosed in the Memorandum or in public filings made by the
Guarantor with the SEC after the date of the Memorandum and prior to the date
hereof, copies of which are attached as Schedule 4.4, and (b) changes that
individually or in the aggregate could not reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on (i) the ability of the Guarantor to perform its
obligations under this Guaranty in a timely manner, (ii) the business, assets,
properties, financial condition, operations or prospects of the Guarantor, or
(iii) the rights or interests of the Lessor or Assignee under this Guaranty.

          4.5  ORGANIZATION AND OWNERSHIP OF SHARES OF MATERIAL SUBSIDIARIES.
(a) Schedule 4.5 to this Guaranty contains on the date hereof complete and
correct lists of (i) the Material Subsidiaries, showing, as to each such
Material Subsidiary, the correct name thereof, the jurisdiction of its
organization, and the percentage of shares of each class of its capital stock or
similar equity interests outstanding owned by the Guarantor and each other
Subsidiary of the Guarantor and (ii) the Guarantor's directors and senior
officers.

                                      -10-
<Page>

               (b)   All of the outstanding shares of capital stock or similar
equity interests of each Material Subsidiary shown in Schedule 4.5 as being
owned by the Guarantor and its Subsidiaries have been validly issued, are fully
paid and nonassessable and are owned by the Guarantor or another Subsidiary free
and clear of any Lien (except as otherwise disclosed in Schedule 4.5).

               (c)   Each Material Subsidiary is a corporation or other legal
entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of
its jurisdiction of organization, and is duly qualified as a foreign corporation
or other legal entity and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which such
qualification is required by law, other than those jurisdictions as to which the
failure to be so qualified or in good standing could not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on (i) the
ability of the Guarantor to perform its obligations under this Guaranty in a
timely manner, (ii) the business, assets, properties, financial condition,
operations or prospects of the Guarantor, or (iii) the rights or interests of
the Lessor or Assignee under this Guaranty. Each such Material Subsidiary has
the corporate or other power and authority to own or hold under lease the
properties it purports to own or hold under lease and to transact the business
it transacts and proposes to transact.

               (d)   As of the date hereof, no Material Subsidiary is a party to
or otherwise subject to any legal restriction or any agreement (other than this
Guaranty, the agreements listed on Schedule 4.5 and customary limitations
imposed by corporate law statutes and applicable regulatory requirements,
including without limitation the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 and
similar provisions of state and local law) restricting the ability of such
Material Subsidiary to pay dividends out of profits or make any other similar
distributions of profits to the Guarantor or any of its Subsidiaries that owns
outstanding shares of capital stock of such Material Subsidiary.

          4.6  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. The consolidated financial statements of
the Guarantor incorporated by reference in the Memorandum (including in each
case the related schedules and notes) fairly present in all material respects
the consolidated financial position of the Guarantor and its Consolidated
Subsidiaries as of the respective dates of such financial statements and the
consolidated results of their operations and cash flows for the respective
periods of such financial statements and have been prepared in accordance with
GAAP consistently applied throughout the periods involved except as set forth in
the notes thereto (subject, in the case of any interim financial statements, to
normal year-end adjustments).

          4.7  CHANGES. Except as disclosed in the Memorandum or in public
filings made by the Guarantor with the SEC after the date of the Memorandum and
prior to the date hereof, copies of which are attached as Schedule 4.4, since
December 31, 1999, there has been no material adverse change in the business,
assets, properties, revenues, financial condition, operations or prospects of
the Guarantor, nor any change which could reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on (a) the ability of the Guarantor to perform its
obligations under this Guaranty in a timely manner, (b) the business, assets,
properties, financial condition, operations or prospects of the Guarantor, or
(c) the rights or interests of the Lessor or Assignee under this Guaranty.

          4.8  COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS, OTHER INSTRUMENTS, ETC. The execution,
delivery and performance by the Guarantor of this Guaranty will not (a)
contravene, result in any breach of, or

                                      -11-
<Page>

constitute a default under, or result in the creation of any Lien in respect of
any property of the Guarantor or any of its Subsidiaries under, any indenture,
mortgage, deed of trust, loan, purchase or credit agreement, lease, corporate
charter or by-laws, or any other Material agreement or instrument to which the
Guarantor or any of its Subsidiaries is bound or by which the Guarantor or any
of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties may be bound or
affected, (b) conflict with or result in a breach of any of the terms,
conditions or provisions of any order, judgment, decree or ruling of any court,
arbitrator or Governmental Authority applicable to the Guarantor or any of its
Subsidiaries or (c) violate any provision of any statute or other rule or
regulation of any Governmental Authority applicable to the Guarantor or any of
its Subsidiaries.

          4.9  GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORIZATIONS, ETC. No consent, approval or
authorization of any Governmental Authority is required in connection with the
execution, delivery or performance by the Guarantor of this Guaranty.

          4.10 LITIGATION; OBSERVANCE OF AGREEMENTS, STATUTES AND ORDERS.

               (a)   Except as disclosed in public filings made by the Guarantor
with the SEC prior to the date hereof and in the Memorandum (including the
Guarantor's consolidated financial statements incorporated therein by
reference), there are no actions, suits or proceedings pending or, to the
knowledge of the Guarantor, threatened against or affecting the Guarantor or any
of its Subsidiaries or any property of the Guarantor or any of its Subsidiaries
in any court or before any arbitrator of any kind or before or by any
Governmental Authority, which, if adversely determined, could reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse effect on (i) the ability of the Guarantor
to perform its obligations under this Guaranty in a timely manner, (ii) the
business, assets, properties, financial condition, operations or prospects of
the Guarantor, or (iii) the rights or interests of the Lessor or Assignee under
this Guaranty.

               (b)   Neither the Guarantor nor any of its Subsidiaries is in
default under any term of any agreement or instrument to which it is a party or
by which it is bound, or any order, judgment, decree or ruling of any court,
arbitrator or Governmental Authority applicable to it, or is in violation of any
applicable law, ordinance, rule or regulation (including without limitation
Environmental Requirements) of any Governmental Authority, which default or
violation, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to
have a material adverse effect on (i) the ability of the Guarantor to perform
its obligations under this Guaranty in a timely manner, (ii) the business,
assets, properties, financial condition, operations or prospects of the
Guarantor, or (iii) the rights or interests of the Lessor or Assignee under this
Guaranty.

          4.11 TAXES. The Guarantor and its Subsidiaries have filed all tax
returns that are required to have been filed in any jurisdiction, and have paid
all taxes shown to be due and payable on such returns and all other taxes and
assessments levied upon them or their properties, assets, income or franchises,
to the extent such taxes and assessments have become due and payable and before
they have become delinquent, except for any taxes and assessments (a) the
nonpayment of which could not, individually or in the aggregate, be expected to
have a material adverse effect on (i) the ability of the Guarantor to perform
its obligations under this Guaranty in a timely manner, (ii) the business,
assets, properties, financial condition, operations or prospects of the
Guarantor, or (iii) the rights or interests of the Lessor or Assignee under this
Guaranty; or (b) the amount, applicability or validity of which is currently
being contested in good faith by

                                      -12-
<Page>

appropriate proceedings and with respect to which the Guarantor or any of its
Subsidiaries, as the case may be, has established adequate reserves in
accordance with GAAP.

          4.12 TITLE TO PROPERTY; LEASES. The Guarantor and its Material
Subsidiaries have good and sufficient title to their respective properties that
individually or in the aggregate are Material to their respective businesses,
including all such properties reflected in the most recent audited balance sheet
included in the Memorandum or purported to have been acquired by the Guarantor
or any Material Subsidiary after the date of such balance sheet (except as sold
or otherwise disposed of in the ordinary course of business). The Lease and all
other leases of Guarantor and its Material Subsidiaries that individually or in
the aggregate are Material to their respective businesses are valid and
subsisting and are in full force and effect in all material respects.

          4.13 LICENSES, PERMITS, ETC.

               (a)   The Guarantor and its Material Subsidiaries own or possess
all licenses, permits, franchises, authorizations, patents, proprietary
software, copyrights, service marks, trademarks and trade names, or rights
thereto, that individually or in the aggregate are Material, without known
conflict with the rights of others.

               (b)   No product of the Guarantor or any Material Subsidiary
infringes in any Material respect on any license, permit, franchise,
authorization, patent, proprietary software, copyright, service mark, trademark,
trade name or other right owned by any other Person.

               (c)   There is no Material violation by any Person of any right
of the Guarantor or any of its Material Subsidiaries with respect to any patent,
proprietary software, copyright, service mark, trademark, trade name or other
right owned or used by the Guarantor or any of its Material Subsidiaries.

          4.14 COMPLIANCE WITH ERISA.

               (a)   The Guarantor and each member of the ERISA Group have
operated and administered each Plan in compliance with all applicable laws
except for such instances of noncompliance as have not resulted in and could not
reasonably be expected to result in a material adverse effect on (i) the ability
of the Guarantor to perform its obligations under this Guaranty in a timely
manner, (ii) the business, assets, properties, financial condition, operations
or prospects of the Guarantor, or (iii) the rights or interests of the Lessor or
Assignee under this Guaranty. Neither the Guarantor nor any member of the ERISA
Group has incurred any liability pursuant to Title I or IV of ERISA or the
penalty or excise tax provisions of the Code relating to employee benefit plans
(as defined in section 3 of ERISA), other than such liabilities as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, be Material, and no event, transaction or
condition has occurred or exists that could reasonably be expected to result in
the incurrence of any such liability by the Guarantor or any member of the ERISA
Group, or in the imposition of any Lien on any of the rights, properties or
assets of the Guarantor or any member of the ERISA Group, in either case
pursuant to Title I or IV of ERISA or to such penalty or excise tax provisions
or to Section 401(a)(29) or 412 of the Code, other than such liabilities or
Liens as would not, individually or in the aggregate, be Material.

               (b)   The present value of the aggregate benefit liabilities
under each of the Plans (other than Multiemployer Plans), determined on the
basis of the actuarial assumptions specified for funding purposes in such Plan's
most recent actuarial valuation report, did not exceed the aggregate current
value of the assets of such Plan allocable to such benefit liabilities.

                                      -13-
<Page>

The term "benefit liabilities" has the meaning specified in section 4001 of
ERISA and the terms "current value" and "present value" have the meaning
specified in section 3 of ERISA.

               (c)   The Guarantor and the ERISA Group have not incurred
withdrawal liabilities (and are not subject to contingent withdrawal
liabilities) under section 4201 or 4204 of ERISA in respect of Multiemployer
Plans that individually or in the aggregate are Material.

               (d)   The expected postretirement benefit obligation (determined
as of the last day of the Guarantor's most recently ended fiscal year in
accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 106, without
regard to liabilities attributable to continuation coverage mandated by section
4980B of the Code) of the Guarantor and its Subsidiaries is reflected in the
financial statements included in the Memorandum as of the respective dates
thereof.

               (e)   The execution and delivery of this Guaranty will not
involve any transaction that is subject to the prohibitions of section 406 of
ERISA or in connection with which a tax could be imposed pursuant to Section
4975(c)(1)(A)-(D) of the Code. The representation by the Guarantor in the first
sentence of this Section 4.14(e) is made in reliance upon and subject to the
accuracy of the representations of the Note Purchasers in Section 2.2 of the
Note Purchase Agreement as to the sources of the funds used to pay the purchase
price of the Notes to be purchased by them thereunder.

          4.15 OFFERING OF THE NOTES AND THIS GUARANTY, ETC. Neither the
Guarantor nor anyone authorized to act on its behalf has offered this Guaranty
or the Notes or any similar securities for sale to, or solicited any offer to
buy any of the same from, or otherwise approached or negotiated in respect
thereof with, any Person other than the Note Purchasers and not more than 125
other institutional investors (all such investors being "accredited investors"
as defined under Section 501(a) of the Securities Act). Neither the Guarantor
nor anyone authorized to act on its behalf has taken, or will take, any action
that would subject the execution and delivery of this Guaranty or the issuance
or sale of the Notes to the registration requirements of Section 5 of the
Securities Act.

          4.16 EXISTING INDEBTEDNESS. Neither the Guarantor nor any Subsidiary
is in default, and no waiver of default is currently in effect, in the payment
of any principal or interest on any Indebtedness of the Guarantor or such
Subsidiary and no event or condition exists with respect to any such
Indebtedness of the Guarantor or any Subsidiary that would permit one or more
Persons to cause such Indebtedness to become due and payable before its stated
maturity, except in each case for any default, event or condition which,
individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on (i) the ability of the Guarantor to perform its
obligations under this Guaranty in a timely manner, (ii) the business, assets,
properties, financial condition, operations or prospects of the Guarantor, or
(iii) the rights or interests of the Lessor or Assignee under this Guaranty.
