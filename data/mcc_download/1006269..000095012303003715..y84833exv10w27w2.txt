<PAGE>
ADVISOR") to assist Loral and its Subsidiaries, including the Borrower, in a

the Lenders (and will arrange for the Financial Advisor to be present and
available to answer questions at such times), during which there will be reports
in reasonable detail on the Borrower's recent results of operations and current
financial condition and the current status of its business and affairs and the
status and any results to date or conclusions (even if preliminary and subject
to change or encompassing a range of alternatives) of the review referred to in
Section 3(a). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Borrower
agrees that it will have a meeting in New York City to which all of the Lenders
are invited no later than July 1, 2003, on a date to be mutually agreed with the

details of such presentation will be delivered to the Administrative Agent for
distribution to the Lenders no later than three Business Days prior to the date
of such meeting.

      (c) The Borrower also agrees that within 45 days after the Amendment
Effective Date Loral will hire a new senior financial officer. The new senior
financial officer shall be a person with significant senior financial management
experience, and specifically shall have experience in situations involving an
assessment of strategic alternatives, including asset sales and other actions to
reduce indebtedness. Loral will consult with the Steering Committee during the
process of selecting this officer and will review the proposed candidate with
the Steering Committee, and the person hired, as well as the responsibilities
and authority he will be given shall be subject to the reasonable approval of a
majority of the Steering Committee. The new senior financial officer shall work
closely with and support the Financial Advisor. The new senior financial officer
shall also participate in reporting to and communicating with the Administrative
Agent, the Steering Committee and the Banks. The new senior


                                       4

Business Plan (to the extent possible, in the case of 2003, given that the
Initial Business Plan provides information on a quarterly basis for 2003) and an
explanation of any significant variances.

      SECTION 6. Other Modifications of the Credit Agreement. The Borrower
agrees that the provisions of the Credit Agreement are modified or added to as
follows:

      (a) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 1.2(b) of the Credit
Agreement, all calculations made for the purposes of determining compliance with
the Credit Agreement shall be made by application of GAAP as in effect for and
applied in the preparation of the Borrower's financial statements dated as of
and for the period ended September 30, 2001.

      (b) The first sentence of Section 2.9(c) of the Credit Agreement is
superceded by the following sentence. The Term Loans shall be prepaid, and the
Commitments shall be automatically reduced, by an amount equal to all net
insurance proceeds in excess of $3,000,000 received on account of any claim or
related group of claims with respect to any Satellite (including without
limitation, for any Launch Failure, any In-Orbit Failure, any Partial Failure or
any anomaly or degradation).

      If any such prepayment is made and involves circumstances in which any
Satellite or transponder has been destroyed or permanently failed, the Borrower,
by notice to the Administrative Agent with a copy to each Lender, may request
that thereafter the requirements of any financial covenant that includes
Consolidated EBITDA be re-calculated on a pro forma basis excluding the
projected revenues (net of any related cost savings) that would have been
derived from such Satellite or transponder. Such notice shall include in
reasonable detail the basis for, and the computations underlying, the
re-calculation requested by the Borrower. The Administrative Agent and E&Y, in
consultation with the Steering Committee, shall promptly review such request and
advise the Borrower whether there are any disagreements with the proposed
re-calculation, setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for any such
disagreement. The Administrative Agent agrees to promptly negotiate in good
faith with the Borrower to resolve any such disagreement, but no such
re-calculation shall be given effect for purposes of determining the Borrower's
compliance with any financial covenant until


                                       6
<PAGE>
approved by a majority of the Steering Committee (it being acknowledged and
agreed (x) by all parties hereto that any such recalculations approved by a
majority of the Steering Committee shall be binding on all the Lenders and
effective for all purposes of the Credit Agreement and (y) by the Borrower that
the Administrative Agent or the Steering Committee may consult with the Lenders,
and may take their views into account). The Administrative Agent shall promptly
notify the Lenders of any such re-calculation approved by the Steering
Committee.

      (c) The provisions of Section 2.12(c) of the Credit Agreement are
superceded by the following sentence. If and for so long as any Event of Default
has occurred and is continuing, all Loans, and all fees and other amounts
payable by the Borrower not paid when due, shall bear interest at, after as well
as before judgment, a rate per annum equal to (i) in the case of principal of
any Loan, 2% plus the rate otherwise applicable to such Loan and (ii) in the
case of any other amount, 2% plus the rate applicable to ABR Loans.

      (d) In Section 5.12 of the Credit Agreement, the following provisions
shall apply, and to the extent inconsistent the provisions of Section 5.12 shall
be superceded:

            (i) The caption of Section 5.12 is renamed as "Satellite Failures,
      Anomalies and Degradations".

            (ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 5.12, the Borrower
      agrees to deposit immediately in the Loral Satellite Collateral Account,
      to be used to prepay the Term Loans and reduce the Commitments, all net
      insurance proceeds in excess of $3,000,000 received on account of any
      claim or related group of claims that is based on the same event with
      respect to any Satellite or transponder (including without limitation, for
      any Launch Failure, any In-Orbit Failure, any Partial Failure or any
      anomaly or degradation).

For the avoidance of doubt, it is agreed that the provisions of Section 5.13 of
the Credit Agreement are also superceded by the amendments to Sections 5.12 and
2.9(c) of the Credit Agreement made hereby.

      (e) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 6.3 of the Credit Agreement
or the provisions of the Existing LSCC Pledge Agreement, the Lenders party
hereto consent to the granting of a junior lien on the Borrower Stock for the
benefit of the lenders under the Loral SpaceCom Credit Agreement, such junior
lien and the existing lien on the Borrower Stock pursuant to the Existing LSCC
Pledge Agreement to be (i) pursuant to an amendment and restatement of the
Existing LSCC Pledge Agreement (which shall be, insofar as senior and junior
liens are involved, substantially in the


                                       7
<PAGE>
form of the Loral SpaceCom Pledge Agreement, mutantis mutandis) and (ii) subject
to the Second Intercreditor Agreement (which shall be, mutatis mutandis,
substantially in the form of the Intercreditor Agreement), and the Joint
Collateral Agent is hereby authorized and directed to enter into the Amended
LSCC Pledge Agreement and the Second Intercreditor Agreement.

      (f) As to Sections 6.6 and 6.7 of the Credit Agreement, clauses (i), (ii)
and (iv) of Section 6.6 and clause (i) of Section 6.7 are superceded in their
entirety by the following. The Borrower may pay dividends to or make loans to
Loral or LSCC ("RESTRICTED PAYMENTS") so long as (i) no Default or Event of
Default shall have occurred and be continuing or would result therefrom, (ii)
Loral has certified to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent that the
proceeds of such Restricted Payment, when received by Loral, are intended to be
and will be applied solely to (A) making any payment, whether principal,
interest or otherwise, required to be made by Loral in respect of its 9-1/2%
Senior Notes due 2006 (the "LORAL NOTES") that is due no later than the Business
Day immediately following the date such Restricted Payment is to be made or (B)
making any payment of principal of or interest on any intercompany note owing by
Loral or any of its Subsidiaries (other than Loral SpaceCom or any of its
Subsidiaries) to Loral SpaceCom or any of its Subsidiaries and (iii) after
giving effect thereto, the aggregate amount of all Restricted Payments described
in subclause (B) made on or after the Amendment Effective Date does not exceed
(1) $3,375,000 plus (2) the excess, if any (but not more than $1,625,000), of
the amount of the interest payment on the Loral Notes due on July 15, 2003 over
the amount of the Restricted Payment described in subclause (A), if any, made in
respect of such interest payment.

      (g) In Section 7(e) of the Credit Agreement, (i) the reference to
$25,000,000 is changed to $15,000,000, (ii) all references to Loral SpaceCom are
changed to "Loral SpaceCom, any of Loral SpaceCom's Material Subsidiaries (as
defined in the Loral SpaceCom Credit Agreement)" and (iii) the period of grace
referred to in clause (A) of Section 7(e) shall be limited to 30 days, provided
that such limitation shall not apply to Loral.

      (h) In Section 7(f) of the Credit Agreement, all references to "the
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, Loral or Loral SpaceCom" are expanded to
include also LSCC and any of Loral SpaceCom's Material Subsidiaries.

      (i) In Section 9.6(c) of the Credit Agreement, (i) the universe of
Purchasing Lenders is expanded to any bank, finance company, insurance company
or other financial institution or fund that in the ordinary course of business
extends credit or buys loans of the type contemplated by the Credit Agreement
and (ii) the consent of the Borrower shall not be required for a sale to a
Purchasing Lender regardless of whether a Default or Event of Default exists at
the time of such sale, nor shall its execution of a Commitment Transfer
Supplement be required pursuant to Section 9.6(e) of the Credit Agreement, but
the Borrower shall still be entitled to receive notice of such sale pursuant to
Section 9.6(e).



                                       8

      SECTION 7. Miscellaneous Provisions. (a) The Borrower acknowledges that
(i) Ernst & Young Corporate Finance LLC has been engaged in connection with the
Credit Agreement as contemplated by the definition of "E&Y" and (ii) the

after receipt, all statements for fees and expenses (which may include amounts
on account) of any financial, accounting or valuation advisors or counsel
retained by the Administrative Agent (or through counsel to the Administrative
Agent) in connection with matters arising in relation to the Credit Agreement

      shall remain in full force and effect and are hereby ratified and
      confirmed in all respects, and that no failure or delay by the Lenders or
      any one of them in exercising any right, power or privilege under any Loan
      Document, or any other action taken or not taken or statement made, during
      the period prior to the date hereof or during the period thereafter shall
      operate as a waiver thereof or obligate any Lender to agree to any further
      amendments to or waivers under any Loan Document; and

            (ii) the Lenders have given no assurance that they will grant any
      further amendments to the Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document.

whether they are Revolving Loans or Term Loans and (ii) the Eurodollar Rate used
to calculate the rate of interest applicable for any Interest Period (including,
as to any day on or after the Amendment Effective Date, for purposes of any
outstanding Interest Period) shall be the greater of (A) the rate otherwise
determined for such Interest Period pursuant to the definition of "Eurodollar
Rate" and (B) 1.50%. The Borrower agrees that on and after the Amendment
Effective Date it will not select any Interest Period that is longer than three
months.

      (b) In addition to the fees payable by the Borrower to the Lenders
pursuant to Section 13(b), the Borrower agrees that if the Amendment Effective
Date occurs the Lenders will on the Amendment Effective Date have earned, and
the Company shall be obligated to pay to the Administrative Agent for the
account of the Lenders ratably in proportion to their outstanding Loans
determined as of the Amendment Effective Date (the "AMENDMENT DATE AMOUNT"),
additional fees (the "ADDITIONAL FEES") in an aggregate amount equal to 0.75% of
the Amendment Date Amount. The Additional Fees shall be payable on January 10,
2004. If any Lender assigns any of its rights in respect of its Loans and
Revolving Credit Commitments, a proportionate amount of the Additional Fees
earned by and payable to such Lender shall be payable to the assignee thereof as
of the day the Additional Fees are payable. The obligation of the Borrower to
pay the Additional Fees has been imposed as a condition to this Amendment by the
Majority Lenders expressly on the basis that, being required only by a vote of
the Majority Lenders, it is not intended to be and shall not be a fee for
purposes of clause (a) of Section 9.1 of the Credit Agreement, and


                                       10
<PAGE>
accordingly the amount thereof may be reduced and the date for payment thereof
may be extended with the consent of the Majority Lenders.

      SECTION 10. Representations of the Borrower. The Borrower represents and
warrants that, except as expressly waived hereby, (i) the representations and
warranties of the Borrower set forth in Article 3 of the Credit Agreement will
be true on and as of the Amendment Effective Date, except where such
representations and warranties expressly relate to an earlier date, in which
case such representation and warranty shall be true and correct as of such
earlier date and (ii) no Default will have occurred and be continuing on such
date. The Borrower further represents and warrants that:

      (a) all information (other than projections) heretofore furnished by or on
behalf of the Borrower to the Administrative Agent or any Lender for purposes of
or in connection with this Amendment does not, and all such information
hereafter furnished by or on behalf of the Borrower to the Administrative Agent
or any Lender will not, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact necessary in order to make statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were or will be made, not
misleading; and

      (b) the projections upon which the Initial Business Plan was and the
Updated Business Plan will be based and any similar information provided in
writing to the Lenders by or on behalf of the Borrower pursuant to the Credit
Agreement or this Amendment will in each case be based upon good faith estimates
and assumptions believed by the Borrower's and Loral's senior management to be
reasonable at the time delivered and at the time prepared and delivered
represent their reasonable best estimate of the future performance of the
Borrower and its Subsidiaries.

            (ii) confirmation that the Borrower has paid all statements of Davis
      Polk & Wardwell, special counsel for the Administrative Agent, and of E&Y

      with payment of any amounts due thereunder on the Amendment Effective
      Date; and

            (vi) the Administrative Agent shall have received such opinions of

      contemplated hereby as it shall have reasonably requested.

Agent shall notify each of the parties hereto, and such notice shall be
conclusive and binding on all parties hereto.

      (b) No later than the first Business Day after the Amendment Effective
Date the Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent, in immediately
available funds, for the account of each Lender that has evidenced its agreement
hereto as provided above by the later of (i) Noon (New York City time) on March
31, 2003 and (ii) 5:00PM (New York City time) on the date the Administrative
Agent issues a notice to the Lenders saying that the Amendment Effective Date
has occurred, a waiver fee in an amount equal to 0.25% of such Lender's
Amendment Date Amount; provided that the date and time by which a Lender's
evidence of its agreement must be made in order to be entitled to receive such
fee may be extended, on a uniform basis for all Lenders, to such later date and
time as the Borrower may agree.
