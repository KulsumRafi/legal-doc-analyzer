1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Modification of Top-Heavy Rules.</u></b>
<dir>
<dir>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Effective Date.</u>&nbsp; This Section
shall apply for purposes of determining whether the Plan is a top-heavy
plan under Section 416(g) of the Code for Plan Years beginning after December
31, 2001, and whether the Plan satisfies the minimum benefits requirements
of Section 416(c) of the Code for such years. This Section 1 amends the
relevant provisions of Section 14 of the Plan.
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Determination of Top-Heavy Status.</u><u></u>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<u>Key Employee.</u>&nbsp; Key Employee means any Employee or former Employee
(including any deceased Employee) who at any time during the Plan Year
that includes the Determination Date was an officer of the Employer having
annual compensation greater than $130,000 (as adjusted under Section 416(i)(1)
of the Code for Plan Years beginning after December 31, 2002), a 5-percent
owner of the Employer, or a 1-percent owner of the Employer having annual
compensation of more than $150,000. For this purpose, annual compensation
means compensation within the meaning of Section 415(c)(3) of the Code.
The determination of who is a Key Employee will be made in accordance with
Section 416(i)(1) of the Code and the applicable regulations and other
guidance of general applicability issued thereunder.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<u>Determination of present values and amounts.</u>&nbsp; This Section
1(b)(ii) shall apply for purposes of determining the present values of
accrued benefits and the amounts of account balances of Employees as of
the Determination Date.
<br>&nbsp;
<dir>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<u>Distributions during year ending on the Determination Date.</u>&nbsp;
The present values of accrued benefits and the amounts of account balances
of an Employee as of the Determination Date shall be increased by the distributions
made with respect to the Employee under the Plan and any plan aggregated
with the Plan under Section 416(g)(2) of the Code during the 1-year period
ending on the Determination Date. The preceding sentence shall also apply
to distributions under a terminated plan which, had it not been terminated,
would have been aggregated with the Plan under Section 416(g)(2)(A)(i)
of the Code. In the case of a distribution made for a reason other than
separation from service, death, or disability, this provision shall be
applied by substituting "5-year period" for "1-year period."

<dir>
<dir>&nbsp;</dir>
</dir>
</dir>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<u>Employees not performing services during year ending on the Determination
Date.</u> The accrued benefits and accounts of any individual who has not
performed services for the Employer during the 1-year period ending on
the Determination Date shall not be taken into account.

(c) <u>Minimum Benefits.</u><u></u>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<u>Matching contributions.</u> Employer matching contributions shall be
taken into account for purposes of satisfying the minimum contribution
requirements of Section 416(c)(2) of the Code and the Plan. The preceding
sentence shall apply with respect to matching contributions under the Plan
or, if the Plan provides that the minimum contribution requirement shall
be met in another plan, such other plan. Employer matching contributions
that are used to satisfy the minimum contribution requirements shall be
treated as matching contributions for purposes of the actual contribution
percentage test and other requirements of Section 401(m) of the Code.</dir>

purposes of the direct rollover provisions in Section 7.5 of the Plan,
an eligible retirement plan shall also mean an annuity contract described
in Section 403(b) of the Code and an eligible plan under Section 457(b)
of the Code which is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a
state, or any agency or instrumentality of a state or political subdivision
of a state and which agrees to separately account for amounts transferred
into such plan from this Plan. The definition of eligible retirement plan
shall also apply in the case of a distribution to a surviving spouse, or
to a spouse or former spouse who is the alternate payee under a qualified
domestic relations order, as defined in Section 414(p) of the Code.</dir>
