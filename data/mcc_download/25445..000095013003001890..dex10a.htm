a Delaware corporation (the &#147;<u>Company</u>&#148;), initially adopted an annual incentive compensation program based on the principles of Economic Value Added.&#160; The purpose of this approach is to maximize shareholder value by aligning
management&#146;s interests with those of the Company&#146;s shareholders and rewarding management for sustainable and continuous improvement in the business being managed.&#160; The Board of Directors of the Company (the &#147;<u>Board</u>&#148;)
approved certain amendments to the Plan effective January 1, 2002 for the corporate office participants in order to more closely align the EVA calculations under the Plan with the financial results reported to shareholders and to achieve greater
transparency to the participants in the financial calculations required under the Plan.&#160; This is an amendment and restatement of the Plan effective January 1, 2002 for the corporate office participants.&#160; For all periods prior to January 1,
2002, the provisions of the Plan as in effect prior to this restatement shall govern.&#160; </font></p>
