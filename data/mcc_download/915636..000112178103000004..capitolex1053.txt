obligation whatsoever that can or may be charged against the Company or made any
misrepresentation  or omission to a third  party  creating a liability  upon the
Company, nor has such Member received or discharged any of the credits,  moneys,

         Closing,  there is no  undisclosed  debt on the  Maumelle  Tract except
         those  disclosed in this Agreement.  Under this Agreement,  it shall be
         CDA's responsibility to provide the required documentation to transfer,

                  (B) To TPI shall be  distributed  all rights of the Company in
         the life insurance contracts (the " VSC's"), if any, which are owned by
         the Company as of the date of this Agreement and TPI hereby agrees that
         all of the TPI Advances are deemed satisfied.  Under this Agreement, it
         shall be TPI's responsibility to provide the required  documentation to
         transfer, assign and quitclaim the VSC's from the Company to TPI.

                  (C) Each Member hereby agrees that such  distributions  in (A)
         and (B) of this Section 3.03 are in the ratio that the Member's capital
         account and income  account  combined bear to the combined  capital and
         income accounts of both Members, provided,  however, that CDA shall pay
         to TPI the sum of Five Hundred and Eighty Thousand  Dollars  ($580,000)
         (the  "Advance  Repayment").  This Advance  Repayment  shall be due and
         payable to TPI upon the closing on Tract D or the closing from the sale
         of any of the Maumelle Tracts,  whichever  occurs first;  provided this
         Advance Repayment is not assignable.  Notwithstanding,  if CDA does not
         receive a  Schedule  K1 in a timely  manner  for the tax years of 2002,
         2003,  and any  subsequent  year until the Company is dissolved and has
         filed its final tax report,  CDA shall withhold $10,000 in escrow until
         the prerequisite  Schedule K1(s) is submitted by TPI. If CDA incurs any
         liability for late filing fees and penalties due to TPI not  submitting
         such Schedules in a timely  manner,  CDA shall have the right to deduct
         such   fees   from   the   escrowed   amount.    The   Company   shall,
         contemporaneously  with the  execution of this  Agreement,  execute and
         deliver  to CDA a special  warranty  deed (the  "Deed")  conveying  fee
         simple and merchantable title in Maumelle Tracts to CDA, free and clear
         of all encumbrances arising from the Company except for the lien of the
         mortgage  securing  the New  Era  Mortgage  Debt.  The  Company  shall,
         contemporaneously  with the  execution of this  Agreement,  execute and
         deliver to TPI an  assignment  and  quitclaim  of any rights  which the
         Company may have in the VSC's,  without any  representation or warranty
         of any kind including  warranty of title.  Immediately upon recordation
         of the Deed with the Pulaski County  Arkansas  Clerk and Recorder,  CDA
         shall order a policy of title  insurance  insuring  fee simple title in
         and to the  Maumelle  Tracts in CDA for the fair market  value of same.
         Upon receipt by CDA of such title insurance  policy insuring fee simple
         title in CDA to the Maumelle Tracts,  subject to no debt other than the
         mortgage  securing  the New Era Mortgage  Debt,  then CDA shall pay the
         Advance  Repayment  subject to the sale of the Maumelle  Tract,  as set
         forth above.

         3.04. Settling Accounts.  On Closing,  the Members shall pay all of the
liabilities of the Company, except as specifically provided in Sections 3.02 and
3.03, in accordance with Sections 450.4801 et seq. of the Michigan Compiled Laws
Annotated,  though no assets or liabilities of the Company,  except as set forth
in Section 3.02 and 3.03 of this Agreement, are known to exist by either Member.
All  amounts   remaining  after  payment  of  the  above  liabilities  shall  be
distributed to the Members according to their sharing ratio set forth in Section
3.01(i) hereof,  subject to the provisions of Sections 3.02 and 3.02. Except for
a breach of this Agreement of either of the Members, each of the Members release
each other for any other claim or cause of action  arising from the ownership or
operation of the Company.
