                  senior unsecured debt are at least BBB- and Baa3, respectively
                  (and, if such ratings are BBB- and Baa3, respectively, they

                  the covenants contained in Sections 6G, 6H, 6I and 6J shall,
                  automatically and without further action by the Company
                  (except as set forth below) or the Holders, be amended to
                  reflect (a) any amendments or new provisions that make the
                  terms of any corresponding covenants contained in the Citibank

                  such covenants in the Citibank Agreements or any such
                  replacement agreement. Any such automatic amendment to this
                  Agreement shall be effective as of the date of, and upon
                  delivery by the Company to the Holders of an executed copy of,

                  Service, Inc.'s ratings for the Company's long-term senior
                  unsecured debt are at least BBB and Baa2, respectively (and,
                  if such ratings are BBB and Baa2, respectively, they are not
                  the subject of a credit watch with negative outlook), in the
                  event any of the financial covenants set forth in Section 5.03
                  of each of the Citibank Agreements as of December 31, 2002 is
                  amended in any manner to make such financial covenant more
                  restrictive, such financial covenant shall, automatically and

                  included as a new covenant in this Agreement as of the date of
                  such amendment. As promptly as practicable, but in no event
                  more than 10 Business Days, following receipt by the Holders
                  of a written request by the Company together with a true and
                  correct copy of any such amendment to the Citibank Agreements
                  and a proposed draft of the corresponding amendment to this
                  Agreement, the Required Holders and the Company shall execute
                  a written amendment to this Agreement (in form and substance
                  reasonably acceptable to the Required Holders and the Company)
                  incorporating such new financial covenant herein effective as

                  will not permit any of its Consolidated Subsidiaries to, make
                  any Capital Expenditures that would cause the aggregate of all
                  such Capital Expenditures made by the Company and its
                  Consolidated Subsidiaries to exceed $175,000,000 in any
                  calendar year; provided that, if for any calendar year, the
                  amount permitted above for such calendar year exceeds the
                  Capital Expenditures made in such year, the Company and its
                  Consolidated Subsidiaries shall be entitled to make Capital
                  Expenditures in the immediately succeeding calendar year in an
                  amount equal to the sum of (i) $175,000,000 and (ii) the
                  lesser of (a) such excess and (b) $40,000,000. For purposes of

                  prior to such extension, refunding or refinancing, and the
                  direct and contingent obligors therefor shall not be changed,

                  not be effective as to any such Subsidiary that has entered
                  into a guaranty for the benefit of the Holders of all payment
