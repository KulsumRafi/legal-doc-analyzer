books of Seller as of the Closing Date. The Company shall assign to Seller all
of its right, title and interest in and to any and all of such receivables (net
of allowances).

                  (c)      Buyer will deliver to Seller, no later than 30 days
after the date of delivery of the Working Capital Statement and the Commingled
Receivables Valuation, notice of its acceptance of the Working Capital Statement
and the Commingled Receviables Valuation (the "ACCEPTANCE NOTICE") or notice of
its dispute of the Working Capital Statement or the Commingled Receivables
Valuation (a "DISPUTE NOTICE"). In the event of such a dispute by Buyer, Buyer
shall promptly notify Seller in writing of each disputed item, specifying the
amount thereof in dispute and setting forth, in reasonable detail, the basis for
such dispute, as promptly as practicable, but in no event later than 30 days,
following delivery of the Closing Balance Sheet to Buyer. If Buyer delivers an
Acceptance Notice or fails to give a Dispute Notice within the prescribed time
period, Buyer will be deemed to have accepted Seller's determination of Net
Working Capital and the Commingled Receivables Valuation as final. In the event
Buyer timely delivers a Dispute Notice, Seller and Buyer shall attempt to
reconcile the parties' differences. If Seller and Buyer are unable to reach a
resolution within 20 days after receipt by Seller of Buyer's Dispute Notice,
Seller and Buyer shall submit the items remaining in dispute for resolution to a
mutually acceptable accounting firm that neither Seller nor Buyer has retained
at any time since December 31, 2000 (such accounting firm being referred to
herein as the "INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTING FIRM"), which firm shall, within 30 days
after such submission, determine and report to Seller and Buyer upon such
remaining disputed items, and such report shall be final, binding and conclusive
on Seller and Buyer. The fees and disbursements of the Independent Accounting
Firm shall be shared equally between Seller and Buyer.

                  (d)      The Working Capital Statement and the Commingled
Receivables Valuation shall be deemed final for purposes of this Section 2.4
upon the earliest of (i) the failure of Buyer to deliver a Dispute Notice within
30 days of Seller's delivery of the Working Capital

Statement and the Commingled Receivables Valuation, (ii) resolution of all
disputes, pursuant to Section 2.4(c), by Buyer and Seller, or (iii) resolution
of all disputes, pursuant to Section 2.4(c), by the Independent Accounting Firm.
Within 10 days after the Working Capital Statement and the Commingled
Receivables Valuation being deemed final (the "ADJUSTMENT DATE"), a Purchase
Price adjustment shall be made as follows:

                           (i)      in the event that Net Working Capital as of
         the Closing Date is less than $8,750,000, then the Purchase Price shall
         be reduced by an amount equal to the shortfall, and FURTHER REDUCED by
         the amount of the Commingled Receivables Valuation;

                           (ii)     in the event that the Net Working Capital as
         of the Closing Date is greater than $10,000,000, then the Purchase
         Price shall be increased by an amount equal to the excess thereof, less
         the amount of the Commingled Receivables Valuation;

                           (iii)    in the event that the Net Working Capital as
         of the Closing Date is an amount (A) equal to or greater than
         $8,750,000 and (B) equal to or less than $10,000,000, then there shall
         be no Net Working Capital related adjustment to the Purchase Price,
         however the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the amount of the
         Commingled Receivables Valuation.

The result of the calculations in any of clauses (i), (ii), or (iii) above shall
be referred to as the "ADJUSTED PURCHASE PRICE."

If the Adjusted Purchase Price is greater than the Purchase Price (such amount
being the "EXCESS"), then Buyer shall remit to Seller in immediately available
funds (i) an amount equal to the Excess and (ii) the amount of the Receivables
Holdback.

If the Adjusted Purchase Price is less than the Purchase Price (such amount
being the "SHORTFALL"), then Buyer shall retain the Receivables Holdback, and:

         (A)      if the Shortfall is equal to or exceeds the Receivables
                  Holdback, then Seller and Datex, jointly and severally, shall
                  pay to Buyer in immediately available funds an amount equal to
                  the difference between (x) the Shortfall and (y) the
                  Receivables Holdback.

         (B)      if the Shortfall is less than the Purchase Price by an amount
                  less than the Receivables Holdback, then Buyer shall pay to
                  Seller in immediately available funds an amount equal to the
                  difference between (x) the Shortfall and (y) the Receivables
                  Holdback.

                  (e)      Solely in connection with the preparation of the
Closing Balance Sheet and calculations of Net Working Capital and the Commingled
Receivables Valuation:

                           (i)      Buyer shall give Seller and its accountants
         reasonable access to the books and records of the Company, and shall
         cause employees of Buyer and the Company to cooperate with Seller and
         provide Seller with all information reasonably requested, all after
         receiving reasonable notice from Seller of its requirements and
         reaching agreement as to mutually convenient times for review, it being

         6.5      EMPLOYEE MATTERS.

                  (a)      Buyer agrees that each person who is an employee of
the Company as of the Closing Date (each, a "CONTINUING EMPLOYEE") shall be an

Taxes shown to be due thereon.

                  (b)      Buyer shall prepare and file, or cause to be prepared
and filed, all Tax Returns required to be filed by the Company for Tax periods
commencing prior to the Closing Date and ending after the Closing Date (each a

to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing Date.
Buyer shall allow the Seller to review, comment upon and reasonably approve any
such Tax Returns no later than 45 days prior to the filing of such Tax Return.
Buyer and Seller agree that all Tax Returns of the Company for any Straddle
Period shall be filed on the basis that the relevant taxable period ended as of
the close of business on the Closing Date; provided, however, in the case of any
Tax imposed upon the ownership or holding of real or personal property, such
Taxes shall be pro rated based on the percentage of the actual period to which
such Taxes relate that precedes the Closing Date.

                  (c)      Buyer and Seller shall cooperate in preparing and
filing all Tax Returns (including amended returns), handling any Tax audits and
making any claims for Tax refunds, in each case relating to the Business,
including maintaining and making available to each other all records necessary
in connection with such Taxes, and in resolving all disputes with respect to Tax

                  (d)      Seller will promptly, without undue delay, provide
all information and access to books and records of the Company as requested by
Buyer and its representatives, in connection with the audit by KPMG, LLP,
Buyer's independent accounting firm, which audit shall be at Buyer's sole
expense, of the Company's financial statements for periods in the three years
ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 (the "AUDIT") as required for inclusion
in Buyer's required filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in
connection with the Transaction, including signing representation letters
customary in an audit conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards under prevailing regulations. Each party shall prepare and implement a
plan, each which plan may be developed in each such party's sole and absolute

employees, the employees of its

Related Parties, and its independent accounting firm to use their respective
best efforts, to cooperate with and assist Seller in connection with the Audit,
including preparation and delivery of the Company's auditable financial
statements, execution and delivery of the independent accounting firm's report
with respect to the Audit and timely making Buyer's required filings with the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC").

                  (e)      To secure Seller's obligations under Section 6.6(d),
the Audit Holdback shall be retained by the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall
disburse the Audit Holdback, and accrued interest, to Seller upon Buyer's filing
with the SEC, on or before the 75th day after the Closing Date, of the Company's
financial statements covered by the Audit in compliance with applicable SEC
requirements (the "SELLER RELEASE CONDITION"). In the event that the Seller
Release Condition is not satisfied, the Escrow Agent shall deliver the Audit
Holdback, and accrued interest, to Buyer as full liquidated damages suffered by
Buyer for breach by Seller of Section 6.6(d) or as a result of the failure of
the Seller Release Condition (which amount does not constitute a penalty), and
which shall be the exclusive remedy of Buyer for breach by Seller of Section
6.6(d) or as a result of the failure of the Seller Release Condition.

         6.7      FURTHER ASSURANCES. From time to time after the Closing Date,
each of Buyer and Seller, at the reasonable request of the other, will promptly
execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, to the other all
such documents and instruments, in addition to those otherwise required by this
Agreement, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the other, and take
such other actions and give such assurances as may be reasonably required in
order to carry out or evidence the terms of this Agreement.

         6.8      FINANCING EFFORTS. Buyer shall use its best efforts to obtain
financing for the Remainder, whether pursuant to the Commitment or otherwise.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Buyer is unable to obtain such financing on
the Closing Date, Seller shall finance the Remainder, which financing shall be
evidenced by a promissory note executed by Buyer in favor of Seller (in
substantially the form attached hereto as EXHIBIT 6.8.1), which note shall have
a term of six months and shall bear interest at an annual rate of 6% over LIBOR
(as published in the Wall Street Journal on the business day immediately
preceding the Closing Date) for the first three months of the term and at an
annual rate of 9% over LIBOR (as published in the Wall Street Journal on the
business day immediately preceding the Closing Date) for the last three months
of the term. Such note shall be secured by a first priority security interest in
all of the accounts receivable of Buyer's subsidiaries, including Quinton, Inc.
and the Company pursuant to a security agreement in substantially the form
attached hereto as EXHIBIT 6.8.2, and Buyer shall cause its subsidiaries to
execute such financing statements and other documents reasonably requested by
Seller to evidence such security interest.

         6.9      CHANGE OF NAME. As soon as practicable following the Closing
Date, Buyer shall cause the name of the Company to be changed to remove all
references to "Spacelabs," including filing an amendment to the Company's
Certificate of Incorporation with the Delaware Secretary of State, and filings
with any other Governmental Entity as may be reasonable or necessary to give
effect to the name change Buyer shall provide to Seller evidence of the name
change.

balances between Seller and its Related Parties and the Company will be
converted to equity, and no amounts shall be due to Seller or any Related Party
of Seller with respect thereto.

         6.11     TAX REFUNDS. Following Closing, Buyer shall without undue
delay remit and pay to Seller all Tax refunds received by Buyer or the Company
for any Tax filings made by Seller or the Company prior to the Closing Date in
connection with the Business; provided, however, that this Section 6.11 shall in
no way limit Buyer's or the Company's right, with respect to any taxable period
ending after the Closing Date, under applicable federal, state, local or foreign
law to waive or relinquish, with respect to any tax attributes attributable to
the Company, the portion of any carryback period for which such Tax filings were
made.

         6.12     INVENTORY COUNT.. In connection with preparation of the
Closing Balance Sheet and the Audit, a physical count of the Company's inventory
shall be conducted on or about January 2, 2003, at locations mutually agreed by
the parties and their representatives. In locations in which inventory is not
physically counted, a mutually acceptable alternative method for validating
inventory quantities will be utilized.

         6.13     COMMINGLED ASSETS.. On or prior to the Closing Date, and other
than the Commingled Receivables, Seller shall (a) transfer to the Company any
assets owned by the Company which are reflected on the books of Seller for its
cardiology business, including the Company's cash and inventories, and (b)
disclaim any ownership interest in any such assets. No later than 60 days after
the Closing, Seller shall deliver to the Company in Deerfield, Wisconsin or
other mutually acceptable location(s) all of the Company's inventories in

inventory held by Seller's U.S. customer service representatives shall be
delivered to the Company in accordance with the terms of the Transition Services
Agreement.

         8.2      EFFECT OF TERMINATION.

                  (b)      the third-party litigation matters disclosed on

Execution Final                       -29-

<PAGE>

                  (d)      any and all actions, suits, proceedings, claims,
demands, assessments, judgments, costs and expenses, including, without
limitation, reasonable legal fees and expenses, incident to any of the foregoing
or incurred in investigating or attempting to avoid the same or to oppose the
imposition thereof, or in enforcing this indemnity.

         9.4      CERTAIN TAX INDEMNIFICATION BY SELLER AND DATEX. Seller and
Datex, jointly and severally, shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless Buyer,

as a result of the Company having been a member of Seller's consolidated group)
under Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6, or any comparable provision under
state or local law.

         9.5      INDEMNIFICATION PROCEDURE.

                  (a)      The party claiming indemnification (the "CLAIMANT")
shall promptly give notice to the party from whom indemnification is claimed
(the "INDEMNIFYING PARTY") of any claim, whether between the parties or brought
by a third party (each, a "CLAIM"), specifying (a) the factual basis for such
Claim and (b) the estimated amount of the Claim. If the Claim relates to an
action, suit or proceeding filed by a third party against Claimant, such notice
shall be given by Claimant within five business days after written notice of
such action, suit or proceeding was given to Claimant; provided that failure to
give such notice within such five business day period shall not bar or otherwise
prejudice Claimant's rights to indemnification with respect to such third-party
action, suit or proceeding unless any defense, claim, counterclaim or
cross-claim of the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced thereby. If the Claim
relates to any Tax matters, Buyer shall use its reasonable efforts to give any
such notice to the attention of Seller's Tax Department at the address for
notices set forth in Section 10.4 below; provided that failure to give such
notice to the Tax Department shall not bar or otherwise prejudice Claimant's
rights to indemnification for such Tax matters.

                  (b)      Following receipt of notice from the Claimant of a
Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have 30 days to make such investigation of
the Claim as the Indemnifying Party deems necessary or desirable. For the
purposes of such investigation, the Claimant agrees to make available to the
Indemnifying Party and/or its authorized representative(s) the information
relied upon by the Claimant to substantiate the Claim. If the Claimant and the
Indemnifying Party agree at or prior to the expiration of the 30-day period (or
any mutually agreed upon extension thereof) to the validity and amount of such
Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall immediately pay to the Claimant the full
amount of the Claim subject to the terms and limitations and in accordance with
the procedures set forth herein. If the Claimant and the Indemnifying Party do
not agree within the 30-day period (or any mutually agreed upon extension
thereof), the Claimant may seek appropriate legal remedy.

                  (c)      With respect to any Claim by a third party as to
which the Claimant is entitled to indemnification hereunder, the Indemnifying
Party shall have the right to assume, control and thereafter conduct the
defense, compromise or settlement of the third-party Claim with counsel of its
choice, and the Claimant shall cooperate in all reasonable respects with the
Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party elects to assume control of the
defense of any

Execution Final                       -30-

<PAGE>

third-party Claim, the Claimant shall have the right to participate in (but not
control) the defense, compromise or settlement of such Claim at its own expense.
The Indemnifying Party may not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter
into any settlement with respect to the third-party Claim without the prior
written consent of the Claimant (not to be withheld unreasonably) unless the
judgment or proposed settlement (i) involves only the payment of money damages
and (ii) does not impose an injunction or other equitable relief upon the
Claimant. If the Indemnifying Party shall fail to respond within 30 days after
receipt of any third-party Claim, or shall notify the Claimant that it does not
intend to defend against such third-party Claim, the Claimant may conduct a
defense against such third-party Claim in any manner it reasonably may deem
appropriate at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party. Nothing in
this Section 9.5 shall prevent the Claimant from taking such action, at the sole
cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, as may be necessary to prevent a
default judgment from being entered. If the Indemnifying Party does not elect to
assume control or otherwise participate in the defense of any third party Claim,
it shall be bound by the results obtained by the Claimant with respect to such
Claim, and the Indemnifying Party shall be responsible and shall promptly
reimburse Claimant for all associated costs, fees and expenses; provided,
however, in no event will the Claimant consent to the entry of any judgment or
enter into any settlement with respect to the third party Claim without the
prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (not to be withheld
unreasonably). Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Buyer or Seller shall
enter into any compromise or agree to settle any claim pursuant to any Tax audit
or proceeding which would adversely affect the other party without the prior
written consent of the other party, which consent may not be unreasonably
withheld.

                  (d)      If any Claim, whether between the parties or by a
third party, requires immediate action, the parties will make every effort to
reach a decision with respect thereto as expeditiously as possible.

         9.6      LIMITATION ON INDEMNIFICATION.

                  (a)      Except with respect to those Excluded Liabilities
described in clause (ii) of the definition of "Excluded Liabilities" that are
the subject of Section 9.4, Seller shall have no liability under Section 9.2
unless Buyer's aggregate claims for indemnification exceed $500,000 (the
"THRESHOLD"), provided that once the Threshold is exceeded, Seller's liability
shall under Section 9.2 shall include amounts constituting the Threshold;
provided, further, that the minimum amount of any individual claim for
indemnification shall be at least $5,000. In no event shall any adjustment to
the Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2.4 count towards the Threshold. In any
event, Seller's maximum aggregate liability under Section 9.2 shall be limited
to $5,000,000 (the "CAP").

                  (b)      With respect to any Losses claimed under Section 9.4,
Seller's maximum aggregate liability shall be limited to $12,000,000. In no
event shall Claims for Losses under Section 9.4 apply to the Threshold or the
Cap.

                  (c)      The amount payable by Seller to Buyer with respect to
Section 9.2 or 9.4 shall be reduced by the amount of any insurance proceeds
received or expected to be received by Buyer with respect to losses, liabilities
or damages, and each of the parties hereby agrees to use reasonable efforts to
collect any and all insurance proceeds to which it may be entitled in respect

Execution Final                       -31-

<PAGE>

to any such losses, liabilities or damages. Such amount payable shall be further
reduced by the amount of any tax benefit actually realized (including by refund
or by reduction or offset against taxes otherwise payable had the losses,
liabilities or damages not been sustained) by Buyer (or the affiliated or
combined group of which it is a member) by reason of the payment or incurrence
by Buyer of the losses, liabilities or damages or which indemnity is sought or
the occurrence of the event giving rise to such losses, liabilities or damages.
To the extent that insurance proceeds are received and/or a tax benefit is
realized after payment has been made by Seller to Buyer, Buyer shall promptly
pay an amount equal to such proceeds or benefit to Seller.

                  (d)      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Section 9.6, Losses incurred by Buyer or the Company arising out of the Excluded
Plan are not subject to the Threshold or Cap.
