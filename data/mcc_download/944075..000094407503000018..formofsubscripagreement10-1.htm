  conversion or exercise of the Securities and offered pursuant to the Memorandum,
  are registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &quot;Securities
  Act&quot;), or any state securities laws. The Purchaser understands that the
  offering and sale of the Units is intended to be exempt from registration under

  Regulation D promulgated thereunder, based, in part, upon the representations,
  warranties and agreements of the Purchaser contained in this Subscription Agreement;<br>
  <br>
  (b) The Purchaser and the Purchaser's attorney, accountant, purchaser representative
  and/or tax advisor, if any (collectively, the &quot;Advisors&quot;), have received
  the Memorandum and all other documents requested by the Purchaser, have carefully
  reviewed them and understand the information contained therein, and the Purchaser
  and the Advisors, if any, prior to the execution of this Subscription Agreement,
  have had access to substantially the same kind of information that would be
  available in a registration statement filed by the Company under the Securities
  Act;<br>
  <br>
  (c) Neither the Securities and Exchange Commission nor any state securities
  commission has approved the Units or any of the Securities included in the Units
  or Common Stock issuable upon conversion or exercise thereof, or passed upon
  or endorsed the merits of the Offering or confirmed the accuracy or determined
  the adequacy of the Memorandum. The Memorandum has not been reviewed by any
  Federal, state or other regulatory authority;<br>
  <br>
  (d) All documents, records and books pertaining to the investment in the Units
  (including, without limitation, the Memorandum) have been made available for
  inspection by the Purchaser and the Advisors, if any;<br>
  <br>
  (e) The Purchaser and the Advisors, if any, have had a reasonable opportunity
  to ask questions of and receive answers from a person or persons acting on behalf
  of the Company concerning the offering of the Units and the business, financial
  condition, results of operations and prospects of the Company, and all such
  questions have been answered to the full satisfaction of the Purchaser and the
  Advisors, if any;<br>
  <br>
  (f) In evaluating the suitability of an investment in the Company, the Purchaser
  has not relied upon any representation or other information (oral or written)
  other than as stated in the Memorandum;<br>
  <br>
  (g) The Purchaser is unaware of, is in no way relying on, and did not become
  aware of the offering of the Units through or as a result of, any form of general
  solicitation or general advertising including, without limitation, any article,
  notice, advertisement or other communication published in any newspaper, magazine
  or similar media or broadcast over television or radio, in connection with the
  offering and sale of the Units and is not subscribing for Units and did not
  become aware of the offering of the Units through or as a result of any seminar
  or meeting to which the Purchaser was invited by, or any solicitation of a subscription
  by, a person not previously known to the Purchaser in connection with investments
  in securities generally;<br>
  <br>
  (h) The Purchaser has taken no action which would give rise to any claim by
  any person for brokerage commissions, finders' fees or the like relating to
  this Subscription Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (other than
  commissions to be paid by the Company to the Placement Agent);<br>
  <br>
  (i) The Purchaser, together with the Advisors, have such knowledge and experience
  in financial, tax, and business matters, and, in particular, investments in
  securities, so as to enable them to utilize the information made available to
  them in connection with the offering of the Units to evaluate the merits and
  risks of an investment in the Units and the Company and to make an informed
  investment decision with respect thereto;<br>
  <br>
  (j) The Purchaser is not relying on the Company, the Placement Agent or any
  of their respective employees or agents with respect to the legal, tax, economic
  and related considerations as to an investment in the Units, and the Purchaser
  has relied on the advice of, or has consulted with, only his own Advisors;<br>
  <br>
  (k) The Purchaser is acquiring the Units solely for the Purchaser's own account
  for investment and not with a view to resale, assignment or distribution thereof,
  in whole or in part. The Purchaser has no agreement or arrangement, formal or
  informal, with any person to sell or transfer all or any part of the Units,
  Securities contained in the Units, or Common Stock issuable upon conversion
  or exercise thereof, and the Purchaser has no plans to enter into any such agreement
  or arrangement;<br>
  <br>
  (l) The Purchaser must bear the substantial economic risks of the investment
  in the Units indefinitely because none of the securities included in the Units
  may be sold, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of unless subsequently registered
  under the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws or an exemption
  from such registration is available. Legends shall be placed on the securities
  included in the Units to the effect that they have not been registered under
  the Securities Act or applicable state securities laws and appropriate notations
  thereof will be made in the Company's stock books. Stop transfer instructions
  will be placed with the transfer agent of the securities constituting the Units.
  Although the Company has the obligation to register for resale the shares of
  Common Stock underlying the Securities (see Schedule I hereto), there can be
  no assurance that such registration will be completed within the time frames
  required by the Company, or at all;<br>
  <br>
  (m) The Purchaser has adequate means of providing for such Purchaser's current
  financial needs and foreseeable contingencies and has no need for liquidity
  of the investment in the Units for an indefinite period of time;<br>
  <br>
  (n) The Purchaser is aware that an investment in the Units involves a number
  of very significant risks and has carefully read and considered the matters
  set forth under the caption &quot;Risk Factors&quot; in the Memorandum;<br>
  <br>
  (o) The Purchaser meets the requirements of at least one of the suitability
  standards for an &quot;accredited investor&quot; as set forth on the Accredited
  Investor Certification contained herein;<br>
  <br>
  (p) The Purchaser: (i) if a natural person, represents that the Purchaser has
  reached the age of 21 and has full power and authority to execute and deliver
  this Subscription Agreement and all other related agreements or certificates
  and to carry out the provisions hereof and thereof; (ii) if a corporation, partnership,
  limited liability company or partnership, association, joint stock company,
  trust, unincorporated organization or other entity, such entity was not formed
  for the specific purpose of acquiring the Units, such entity is duly organized,
  validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the state of its organization,
  the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby is authorized by, and
  will not result in a violation of state law or its charter or other organizational
  documents, such entity has full power and authority to execute and deliver this
  Subscription Agreement and all other related agreements or certificates and
  to carry out the provisions hereof and thereof and to purchase and hold the
  securities constituting the Units, the execution and delivery of this Subscription
  Agreement has been duly authorized by all necessary action, this Subscription
  Agreement has been duly executed and delivered on behalf of such entity and
  is a legal, valid and binding obligation of such entity; and (iii) if executing
  this Subscription Agreement in a representative or fiduciary capacity, it has
  full power and authority to execute and deliver this Subscription Agreement
  in such capacity and on behalf of the subscribing individual, ward, partnership,
  trust, estate, corporation, limited liability company or limited liability partnership,
  or other entity for whom the Purchaser is executing this Subscription Agreement,
  and such individual, ward, partnership, trust, estate, corporation, limited
  liability company or partnership, or other entity has full right and power to
  perform pursuant to this Subscription Agreement and make an investment in the
  Company, and that this Subscription Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and
  binding obligation of such entity. The execution and delivery of this Subscription
  Agreement will not violate or be in conflict with any order, judgment, injunction,
  agreement or controlling document to which the Purchaser is a party or by which
  it is bound;<br>
  <br>
  (q) The Purchaser and the Advisors, if any, had the opportunity to obtain any
  additional information, to the extent the Company had such information in its
  possession or could acquire it without unreasonable effort or expense, necessary
  to verify the accuracy of the information contained in the Memorandum and all
  documents received or reviewed in connection with the purchase of the Units
  and have had the opportunity to have representatives of the Company provide
  them with such additional information regarding the terms and conditions of
  this particular investment and the financial condition, results of operations,
  business and prospects of the Company deemed relevant by the Purchaser or the
  Advisors, if any, and all such requested information, to the extent the Company
  had such information in its possession or could acquire it without unreasonable
  effort or expense, has been provided to its full satisfaction;<br>
  <br>
  (r) The Purchaser represents to the Company that any information which the undersigned
  has heretofore furnished or furnishes herewith to the Company or the Placement
  Agent is complete and accurate and may be relied upon by the Company in determining
  the availability of an exemption from registration under Federal and state securities
  laws in connection with the offering of securities as described in the Memorandum.
  The Purchaser further represents and warrants that it will notify and supply
  corrective information to the Company and the Placement Agent immediately upon
  the occurrence of any change therein occurring prior to the Company's issuance
  of the securities contained in the Units;<br>
  <br>
  (s) The Purchaser has significant prior investment experience, including investment
  in non-listed and non-registered securities. The Purchaser has a sufficient
  net worth to sustain a loss of its entire investment in the Company in the event
  such a loss should occur. The Purchaser's overall commitment to investments
  which are not readily marketable is not excessive in view of its net worth and
  financial circumstances and the purchase of the Units will not cause such commitment
  to become excessive. The investment is a suitable one for the Purchaser;<br>
  <br>
  (t) The Purchaser is satisfied that it has received adequate information with
  respect to all matters which it or the Advisors, if any, consider material to
  its decision to make this investment;<br>
  <br>
  (u) The Purchaser acknowledges that any estimates of future prospects, market
  size, projected research and development expenses, regulatory approvals and
  any pro forma financial information included in the Memorandum were prepared
  by the Company in good faith but that the attainment of any such projections
  and estimates cannot be guaranteed by the Company and should not be relied upon;<br>
  <br>
  (v) No oral or written representations have been made, or oral or written information
  furnished, to the Purchaser or the Advisors, if any, in connection with the
  offering of the Units or as to the Company, which are in any way inconsistent
  with the information contained in the Memorandum;<br>
  <br>
  (w) Within five days after receipt of a request from the Company or the Placement
  Agent, the Purchaser will provide such information and deliver such documents
  as may reasonably be necessary to comply with any and all laws and ordinances
  to which the Company or the Placement Agent is subject;<br>
  <br>
  (x) THE SECURITIES OFFERED HEREBY HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES
  ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR THE SECURITIES LAWS OF CERTAIN STATES AND ARE BEING
  OFFERED AND SOLD IN RELIANCE ON EXEMPTIONS FROM THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS
  OF SAID ACT AND SUCH LAWS. THE SECURITIES ARE SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFERABILITY

  UNDERLYING THE SECURITIES, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT SUCH REGISTRATION
  WILL BE COMPLETED WITHIN THE TIME FRAMES REQUIRED, OR AT ALL. THE SECURITIES
  HAVE NOT BEEN APPROVED OR DISAPPROVED BY THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION,
  ANY STATE SECURITIES COMMISSION OR ANY OTHER REGULATORY AUTHORITY, NOR HAVE
  ANY OF THE FOREGOING AUTHORITIES PASSED UPON OR ENDORSED THE MERITS OF THIS
  OFFERING OR THE ACCURACY OR ADEQUACY OF THE MEMORANDUM. ANY REPRESENTATION TO

  more than one person, the obligations of the Purchaser hereunder shall be joint
  and several and the covenants, agreements, representations, warranties, and

  the public domain, was received in confidence. The Purchaser agrees not to divulge,
  communicate or disclose, except as may be required by law or for the performance
  of this Agreement, or use to the detriment of the Company or for the benefit
  of any other person or persons, or misuse in any way, any confidential information
  of the Company, including any scientific, technical, trade or business secrets

  <br>
  15. <b>Preemptive Rights. </b>Following acceptance of this Subscription Agreement
  by the Company and a Closing at which a sale of Units to Purchaser is consummated,
  and for so long as Purchaser or its assigns shall own any shares of Series F
  Preferred Stock (Purchaser, for such purpose, an &quot;Eligible Purchaser&quot;),
  the Company hereby grants to the Eligible Purchaser a right (the &quot;Preemptive

  2. <u>Restrictions on Transferability.</u> The Securities and any other securities
  issued in respect of the Securities upon any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization,
  merger, consolidation, or similar event, shall not be transferred except upon
  the conditions specified in this Agreement, which conditions are intended to
  ensure compliance with the provisions of the Securities Act. Any transferee
  of such securities shall take and hold such securities subject to the provisions
  and upon the conditions specified in this Agreement.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">3. <u>Restrictive Legend.</u>
  Each certificate representing the Securities, the shares of Common Stock underlying
  the Securities and any other securities issued in respect of the Securities
  upon any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, merger, consolidation
  or similar event, shall (unless otherwise permitted or unless the securities
  evidenced by such certificate shall have been registered under the Securities
  Act) be stamped or otherwise imprinted with a legend substantially in the following
  form (in addition to any legend required under applicable state securities laws):</font></p>

  <tr>
    <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED
      BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED FOR INVESTMENT AND HAVE NOT BEEN
      REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE &quot;ACT&quot;)

<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Upon request of Purchaser,
  the Company shall remove the foregoing legend from the certificate or issue
  to such holder a new certificate therefor free of any transfer legend, if, with
  such request, the Company shall have received either an opinion of counsel or
  the &quot;no-action&quot; letter referred to in Section 4 to the effect that
  any transfer by such holder of the securities evidenced by such certificate
  will not violate the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws, unless
  any such transfer legend may be removed pursuant to Rule 144(k) or any successor
  rule, in which case no such opinion or &quot;no-action&quot; letter shall be
  required.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">4. <u>Notice of Proposed
  Transfers.</u> The holder of each certificate representing Restricted Securities
  by acceptance thereof agrees to comply in all respects with the provisions of
  this Section 4. Prior to any proposed transfer of any Restricted Securities,
  the holder thereof shall give written notice to the Company of such holder's
  intention to effect such transfer. Each such notice shall describe the manner
  and circumstances of the proposed transfer in sufficient detail, and shall be
  accompanied by either (i) if required, a written opinion of legal counsel to
  the holder who shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Company, addressed to
  the Company, to the effect that the proposed transfer of the Restricted Securities
  may be effected without registration under the Securities Act or (ii) a &quot;no
  action&quot; letter from the Commission to the effect that the distribution
  of such securities without registration will not result in a recommendation
  by the staff of the Commission that action be taken with respect thereto, whereupon
  the holder of such Restricted Securities shall be entitled to transfer such
  Restricted Securities in accordance with the terms of the notice delivered by
  such holder to the Company. The Company will not require such a legal opinion
  or &quot;no action&quot; letter (x) in any transaction in compliance with Rule
  144 promulgated under the Securities Act, (y) in any transaction in which the
  Purchaser distributes Restricted Securities solely to its stockholders on a
  pro rata basis for no consideration, or (z) in any transaction in which a holder
  which is a partnership or limited liability company distributes Restricted Securities
  solely to its partners or members, as applicable, for no consideration; provided
  that each transferee agrees in writing to be subject to the terms of this Section
  4. Each certificate evidencing the Restricted Securities transferred as above
  provided shall bear the restrictive legend set forth in Section 3 above.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">5.<u> Registration on Form
  S-3.</u></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">(i) The Company shall file
  a registration statement on Form S-3 or other appropriate registration document
  under the Securities Act for resale of the Registrable Securities and shall
  use reasonable efforts to maintain the shelf registration effective for a period
  of 18 months (or so long as a Holder is subject to the volume limitations of
  Rule 144(e) under the Securities Act). The Company shall (a) file such Registration
  Statement no later than (30) days after the last Closing Date (the &quot;Filing
  Date&quot;), (b) use reasonable efforts to cause such Registration Statement
  to become effective within ninety (90) days after the Filing Date, and (c) cause
  such Registration Statement to become effective within one hundred and fifty
  (150) days after the Filing Date.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">(ii) Notwithstanding the
  foregoing, the Company shall not be obligated to take any action pursuant to
  this Section 5 in any particular jurisdiction in which the Company would be
  required to execute a general consent to service of process in effecting such
  registration, qualification or compliance unless the Company is already subject
  to service in such jurisdiction and except as may be required by the Securities
  Act.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">(iii) In the event that
  the Company fails to file the registration statement pursuant to this Section
  5 no later than thirty (30) days after the last Closing Date or if such registration
  statement has not been declared effective within ninety (90) days of the earlier
  of the end of such thirty (30)-day period and the date of filing, the Company
  shall pay Purchaser an amount equal to two percent (2%) of the purchase price
  paid by such Purchaser pursuant hereto in respect of each 30-day period (or
  partial period thereof) of noncompliance. The Company shall make such payments
  on the first day of each month of noncompliance in respect of the number of
  days of noncompliance in the immediately preceding month. Notwithstanding the
  foregoing payments by the Company, the Purchaser may seek any other remedies
  available by law.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">6. <u>Expenses of Registration.</u>
  The Company shall bear all Registration Expenses incurred in connection with
  any registration, qualification or compliance pursuant to this Agreement and
  all underwriting discounts, selling commissions and expense allowances applicable
  to the sale of any securities by the Company for its own account in any registration.
  All Selling Expenses shall be borne by the Holders whose securities are included
  in such registration pro rata on the basis of the number of their Registrable
  Securities so registered.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">7.<u> Indemnification.</u></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">(i) The Company will indemnify
  each Holder, each of its officers, directors, agents, employees and partners,
  and each person controlling such Holder, with respect to each registration,
  qualification or compliance effected pursuant to this Agreement, and each underwriter,
  if any, and each person who controls any underwriter, and their respective counsel
  against all claims, losses, damages and liabilities (or actions, proceedings
  or settlements in respect thereof) arising out of or based on any untrue statement
  (or alleged untrue statement) of a material fact contained in any prospectus,
  offering circular or other document prepared by the Company (including any related
  registration statement, notification or the like) incident to any such registration,
  qualification or compliance, or based on any omission (or alleged omission)
  to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
  to make the statements therein not misleading, or any violation by the Company
  of the Securities Act or any rule or regulation thereunder applicable to the
  Company and relating to action or inaction required of the Company in connection
  with any such registration, qualification or compliance, and will reimburse
  each such Holder, each of its officers, directors, agents, employees and partners,
  and each person controlling such Holder, each such underwriter and each person
  who controls any such underwriter, for any legal and any other expenses as they
  are reasonably incurred in connection with investigating and defending any such
  claim, loss, damage, liability or action, provided that the Company will not
  be liable in any such case to the extent that any such claim, loss, damage,
  liability or expense arises primarily and directly out of or is based on any
  untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) or omission (or alleged omissions)
  based upon written information furnished to the Company by such Holder or underwriter
  and stated to be specifically for use therein.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">(ii) Each Holder whose
  Registrable Securities are included in any registration, qualification or compliance
  effected pursuant to this Agreement will indemnify the Company, each of its
  directors and officers and each underwriter, if any, of the Company's securities
  covered by such a registration statement, each person who controls the Company
  or such underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act and the rules and
  regulations thereunder, each other such Holder and each of their officers, directors
  and partners, and each person controlling such Holder, and their respective
  counsel against all claims, losses, damages and liabilities (or actions in respect
  thereof) arising primarily and directly out of or based on any untrue statement
  (or alleged untrue statement) of a material fact contained in any such registration
  statement, prospectus, offering circular or other document, or any omission
  (or alleged omission) to state therein a material fact required to be stated
  therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will
  reimburse the Company and such Holders, directors, officers, partners, persons,
  underwriters or control persons for any legal or any other expenses as they
  are reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending any such
  claim, loss, damage, liability or action, in each case to the extent, but only
  to the extent, that such untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) or omission
  (or alleged omission) is made in such registration statement, prospectus, offering
  circular or other document in reliance upon and in conformity with written information
  furnished to the Company by such Holder and stated to be specifically for use
  therein; provided, however, that the obligations of such Holders hereunder shall
  be limited to an amount equal to the net proceeds to each such Holder sold under
  such registration statement, prospectus, offering circular or other document
  as contemplated herein.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">(iii) Each party entitled
  to indemnification under this Section 7 (the &quot;Indemnified Party&quot;)
  shall give notice to the party required to provide indemnification (the &quot;Indemnifying
  Party&quot;) promptly after such Indemnified Party has actual knowledge of any
  claim as to which indemnity may be sought, and shall permit the Indemnifying
  Party to assume the defense of any such claim or any litigation resulting therefrom,
  provided that counsel for the Indemnifying Party, who shall conduct the defense
  of such claim or any litigation resulting therefrom, shall be approved by the
  Indemnified Party (whose approval shall not unreasonably be withheld), and the
  Indemnified Party may participate in such defense at such party's expense; and
  provided further that if any Indemnified Party reasonably concludes that there
  may be one or more legal defenses available to it that are not available to
  the Indemnifying Party, or that such claim or litigation involves or could have
  an effect on matters beyond the scope of this Agreement, then the Indemnified
  Party may retain its own counsel at the expense of the Indemnifying Party; and
  provided further that the failure of any Indemnified Party to give notice as
  provided herein shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations
  under this Agreement unless and only to the extent that such failure to give
  notice results in material prejudice to the Indemnifying Party. No Indemnifying
  Party, in the defense of any such claim or litigation, shall, except with the
  consent of each Indemnified Party, consent to entry of any judgment or enter
  into any settlement which does not include as an unconditional term thereof
  the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such Indemnified Party of a release
  from all liability in respect to such claim or litigation. Each Indemnified
  Party shall furnish such information regarding itself or the claim in question
  as an Indemnifying Party may reasonably request in writing and as shall be reasonably
  required in connection with defense of such claim and litigation resulting therefrom.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">(iv) If the indemnification
  provided for in this Section 7 is held by a court of competent jurisdiction
  to be unavailable to an Indemnified Party with respect to any loss, liability,
  claim, damage or expense referred to herein, then the Indemnifying Party, in
  lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Party hereunder, shall contribute to the
  amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Party as a result of such loss, liability,
  claim, damage or expense in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the
  relative fault of the Indemnifying Party on the one hand and of the Indemnified
  Party on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted
  in such loss, liability, claim, damage or expense as well as any other relevant
  equitable considerations. The relative fault of the Indemnifying Party and of
  the Indemnified Party shall be determined by reference to, among other things,
  whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission
  to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Indemnifying
  Party or by the Indemnified Party and the parties' relative intent, knowledge,
  access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or
  omission.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">8.<u> Transfer or Assignment
  of Rights.</u> The benefits to the Holder hereunder may be transferred or assigned
  by a Holder to a transferee or assignee of any of the Restricted Securities,
  provided that the Company is given written notice prior to the time that such
  right is exercised, stating the name and address of said transferee or assignee
  and identifying the securities with respect to which such registration rights
  are being transferred or assigned; provided further that the transferee or assignee
  of such rights assumes in writing the obligations of the Holder under this Agreement.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">9. <u>Registration Procedures.</u>
  In the case of the registration effected by the Company pursuant to this Schedule
  I, the Company will keep each Holder who is entitled to registration benefits
  hereunder advised in writing as to the initiation of each registration and as
  to the completion thereof. At its expense, the Company will:</font></p>

  not ripe for disclosure, and that continued effectiveness of such registration
  statement would be seriously detrimental to the Company or its stockholders,
  in which case the Company's obligation to file a registration statement shall
  be deferred for a period not to exceed ninety (90) days. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> (vii) Comply with all

  the effect of, causing the Company to cease to be subject to the reporting requirements
  of the Exchange Act for so long as a registration statement under this Schedule
  I is required to be filed or caused to be effective, or shall be required to
  be or remain effective; provided, however, that the Company may cease to be
  subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act in the event that
  it is merged with, or acquired by, an entity that is not subject to such reporting
  requirements where the Company is not the surviving entity.<br>
