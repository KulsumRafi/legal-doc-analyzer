otherwise commence. </FONT></P>



<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>8.3 Emergency Benefit. In
the event that the Administrative Committee, upon written petition of the
Participant, determines in its sole discretion, that the Participant has
suffered an unforeseeable financial emergency, the Employer shall pay to the
Participant, as soon as practicable following such determination, the balance of
his Deferred Compensation Accounts for one or more Units of Participation as
necessary to meet the emergency (the &#147;Emergency Benefit&#148;). For
purposes of this Plan, an unforeseeable financial emergency is an unexpected
need for cash arising from an illness, casualty loss, sudden financial reversal,
or other such unforeseeable occurrence. Cash needs arising from foreseeable
events such as the purchase of a house or education expenses for children shall
not be considered to be the result of an unforeseeable financial emergency. Upon
payment of an Emergency Benefit with respect to any Unit of Participation, the
Unit of Participation shall thereupon terminate, and no other benefits shall be
payable under the Plan to either the Participant or any Beneficiary of the
Participant with respect to the Unit of Participation. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>8.4 Commencement of
Payments. Except as otherwise provided in this Plan, commencement of payments
under this Plan shall begin sixty (60) days following the event which entitles a

the event of a change in the employment status of a Participant to a status in
which he is no longer an Eligible Employee under this Plan, but is an eligible
employee under the Management Deferred Compensation Plan of 1988 or another
similar deferred compensation plan of the Employer, the Participant and all of
his Units of Participation under this Plan shall automatically be transferred to
such other deferred compensation plan for which he is then an eligible employee,
unless otherwise determined by the Administrative Committee. In the event of any
such transfer, the provisions of the other deferred compensation plan to which
the Participant transfers shall thereafter determine the rights and benefits of
the Participant with respect to all of his Units of Participation, unless
otherwise determined by the Administrative Committee. The Employer may, but
shall not be required to, enter into revised Agreements with the Participant to
carry out the provisions of this Section. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>8.7 Transfer to RWAC.
Effective August 1, 1990, if a Participant transfers to a RWAC prior to
completion of a Unit of Participation, deferrals which would otherwise have been
made by the Participant in accordance with Section 5.2 shall continue to be made
by the Employer until the Participant resumes employment with the Employer but
for a maximum period not to exceed 5 years. Contributions which would have been
made by the Employer in accordance with Section 5.3 shall also continue to be
made by the Employer during such period as Participant contributions are
continued in accordance with the preceding sentence. Benefits applicable during
the period of employment at a RWAC (not to exceed 5 years) and the methods used
for crediting the Deferred Compensation Account and repaying amounts contributed
by the Employer and reducing the Normal Retirement or Early Retirement Benefit
paid to the Participant or his Beneficiary shall be the same as those applicable
pursuant to Section 6.7 in the case of Disability, i.e., employment at a RWAC
shall be deemed a Disability for the purpose of making determinations pursuant
to Section 6.7. If the Participant has not resumed employment with the Employer
or has not completed a Unit of Participation as result of Employer Contributions
within 5 years from date of transfer, a Termination Benefit based on the amounts
credited to the Participant&#146;s Deferred Compensation Account at the date of
transfer shall be paid upon termination of employment with a RWAC or the
expiration of such 5 year period whichever is earlier. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>8.8 Leave of Absence. If a
Participant absents himself from employment on a formally granted leave of
absence (i.e., the absence is with formal permission in order to prevent a break
in the continuity of the Employee&#146;s term of employment which permission is
granted in conformity with the rules of the Employer which employs the
individual, as adopted from time to time), all of the Participant&#146;s Units
of Participation shall automatically be frozen upon such leave of absence,
unless otherwise determined by the Administrative Committee. No Participant
deferrals or Employer contributions shall be made during the leave of absence.
However, during the leave of absence (for a period not to exceed six (6)
months), the Participant shall continue to be credited with interest on his
Deferred Compensation Accounts as provided under Section 5.1 and to vest in such
amounts as provided under Section 5.4, and all benefits shall continue to be
payable to the Participant and his Beneficiaries in accordance with Section 6
hereof, except in the case of a political leave (i.e., to campaign for or serve
when elected to a political office, to serve if appointed to public office or
for non-candidate employees to participate in campaigns of candidates for
political office). In the case of such a political leave, except as provided
under Section 8.1, the only benefit payable if the Participant dies during such
leave shall be a Termination Benefit based on the amounts credited to the
Participant&#146;s Deferred Compensation Accounts, which shall be payable to the
Participant&#146;s Beneficiary. If the Participant returns to employment with
the Employer in an employment status which makes him eligible to participate in
this Plan within six (6) months from commencement of the leave of absence,
Participant deferrals and Employer contributions will resume until the end of
the original Unit Deferral Period. If the Participant has not resumed employment
with the Employer in an employment status which makes him eligible to
participate in this Plan within six (6) months from the commencement of the
leave of absence, a Termination Benefit based on the amounts credited to the
Participant&#146;s Deferred Compensation Accounts shall be paid to the
Participant. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>11.1 Unsecured General
Creditor. Participants and their Beneficiaries, heirs, successors, and assigns
shall have no legal or equitable rights, interest, or claims in any property or
assets of Employer, nor shall they be Beneficiaries of, or have any rights,
claims, or interests in any life insurance policies, annuity contracts, or the
proceeds therefrom owned or which may be acquired by Employer
(&#147;Policies&#148;). Any such Policies or other assets of Employer shall not
be held under any trust for the benefit of Participants, their Beneficiaries,
heirs, successors, or assigns, or held in any way as collateral security for the
fulfilling of the obligations of Employer under this Plan. Any and all of the
Employer&#146;s assets and Policies shall be, and remain, the general,
unpledged, unrestricted assets of Employer. Employer&#146;s obligation under the
Plan shall be merely that of an unfunded and unsecured promise of Employer to
pay money in the future. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>11.2 Trust Fund. The
Employer shall be responsible for the payment of all benefits provided under the
Plan. At its discretion, the Company may establish one or more trusts, for the
purpose of providing for the payment of such benefits. Such trust or trusts may
be irrevocable, but the assets thereof shall be subject to the claims of the
Employer&#146;s creditors. To the extent any benefits provided under the Plan
are actually paid from any such trust, the Employer shall have no further
obligation with respect thereto, but to the extent not so paid, such benefits
shall remain the obligation of, and shall be paid by, the Employer. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>11.3 Obligations to
Employer. If a Participant becomes entitled to a distribution of benefits under
the Plan, the Employer may offset against the amount of benefits otherwise
distributable any claim to reimbursement for intentional wrongdoing by the
Participant against the Employer or an affiliate. Such determination shall be
made by the Administrative Committee. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>11.4 Nonassignability.
Neither a Participant nor any other person shall have any right to commute,
sell, assign, transfer, pledge, anticipate, mortgage, or otherwise encumber,
transfer, hypothecate or convey in advance of actual receipt the amounts, if
any, payable hereunder, or any part thereof, which are, and all rights to which
are, expressly declared to be unassignable and non-transferable. No part of the
amounts payable shall, prior to actual payment, be subject to seizure or
sequestration for the payment of any debts, judgments, alimony or separate
maintenance owed by a Participant or any other person, nor be transferable by
operation of law in the event of a Participant&#146;s or any other person&#146;s
bankruptcy or insolvency. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>11.5 Employment Not
Guaranteed. Nothing contained in this Plan nor any action taken hereunder shall

be retained in the employ of the Employer or to serve as a director. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>11.6 Protective Provisions.
A Participant will cooperate with the Employer by furnishing any and all
information requested by the Employer, in order to facilitate the payment of
benefits hereunder, taking such physical examinations as the Employer may deem
necessary and taking such other relevant action as may be requested by the
