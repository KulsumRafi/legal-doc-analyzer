                     Re:  EXCHANGE OFFER FOR AVAYA LYONS
                          ------------------------------

Ladies & Gentlemen:

                     Reference is made to (1) the Backstop Agreement, dated as
of December 23, 2002, as amended January 13, 2003 (the "Agreement"), by and
among Avaya Inc. ("Avaya") and the Investors signatories thereto, and in
particular Section 2.01(b)(i) thereof, and (2) the draft press release (the
"Release") attached as Exhibit A hereto. Capitalized terms used but not defined
in this letter shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Agreement.

                     This letter confirms that Avaya and the Investors have
agreed, notwithstanding Avaya's intention to make a public announcement on the
date of this letter substantially in the form of the Release (the
"Announcement"), that the second proviso of Section 2.01(b)(i) of the Agreement
shall not apply to the Announcement and that the Exchange Offer shall not be
extended as a result of Avaya making such Announcement.


                            [Signature page follows]
