     Title Matter (other than Inapplicable Exceptions), Buyer has not received
     by the Last Closing Date either:

                    (i)  Where such Objectionable Title Matter would otherwise
               be within the scope of coverage of the Title Policy, written
               confirmation from the Title Company that such Objectionable Title
               Matter will not be scheduled as an exception in the Title Policy,
               or

                    (ii) Confirmation from the Title Company that it will

               Objectionable Title Matter, by an endorsement to the Title Policy

     Buyer shall have the right to terminate Escrow and this Agreement by
     written notice of termination given to Seller and Escrow Agent no later
     than the Last Closing Date and if Buyer does not so elect to terminate this
     Agreement, Buyer shall be deemed to have waived its objection to the
     Objectionable Title Matter(s) in question. If, after receiving from Buyer
     timely written notice of an Objectionable Title Matter, Seller at any time
     gives Buyer written notice that such Objectionable Title Matter will not be
     remedied by one of the means specified above and Buyer does not within five
     Business Days after receiving such notice from Seller give Seller written
     notice waiving Buyer's objection to such Objectionable Title Matter, Seller

     termination given to Seller and Escrow Agent. Any Objectionable Title
     Matter to which Buyer waives, or is deemed to waive, its objection, as
     provided above, shall be deemed to be a Permitted Exception.

the right to terminate this Agreement on or before the Approval Date by giving
Seller written notice that any of the conditions specified in Section 3.3.1

          2.5.4 DETERMINATION OF PRORATIONS AND CREDITS. The prorations and

               most recent available tax bill for the Real Property.

               paid by Seller.

                    (iii) In the case of all other prorations and credits, a

               approval, shall prepare and deliver to Escrow Agent at least one
               full Business Day prior to the Last Closing Date.

     from the proceeds of the Purchase Price payable to Seller at Closing.

          2.5.5 UTILITY CHARGES. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, use
     charges for any utility serving the Property shall be prorated only if

               cancellation, Escrow Agent has not received from such other Party
               written instructions which conflict in any way with such demand,
               Escrow Agent shall cancel Escrow, disburse the Deposit as

               demand regarding the Deposit, disburse the Deposit to Buyer) and

               instructions from such other Party, Escrow Agent shall take no

<PAGE>


               further actions with respect to Escrow (other than to continue to
               invest and reinvest the Deposit as provided in Section 2.1.1)
               except (A) in accordance with joint written instructions of
               Seller and Buyer or (B), upon advice of Escrow Agent's legal
               counsel, in accordance with a certified copy of the order or
               judgment of any court; provided, however, that if Seller and
               Buyer have not provided Escrow Agent with joint written
               instructions as to the disposition of Escrow (and all items
               deposited therein) within 60 days after Escrow Agent's receipt of
               such demand for cancellation, Escrow Agent shall have the right
               (at any time thereafter) to commence an action in interpleader
               against Seller and Buyer and, in connection therewith, to deposit

communications by Escrow Agent under this Section 2.8 shall be given and
delivered in accordance with Section 3.14.

Title Policy issued with extended coverage (i.e., with general exceptions for
certain non-record matters excepted), but Buyer shall have the responsibility of
obtaining and delivering a Survey to the Title Company in sufficient time to
permit issuance of an extended coverage policy and Buyer's obligation to close

coverage policy. Seller shall, upon request, provide the Title Company with an
owner's declaration or affidavit, on the type customarily required for issuance
of an extended coverage title policy and in a form or forms reasonably
acceptable to Seller, but Seller shall not otherwise have any obligation with
respect to Buyer's obtaining extended coverage on the Title :Policy.

               force and effect and, to Seller's knowledge, there are no events
               which, with the giving of notice or the passage of time, or both,
               would cause a default or Event of Default under the Leases.

               Service Contracts, and the Property Records include true and

               applicable Law governing the use, storage, release or disposal of
               Hazardous Substances. To Seller's Knowledge, Seller has not
               deposited or released any Hazardous Substances on the Real
               Property in violation of any applicable laws, rule or regulations

               Seller or, to Seller's Knowledge, otherwise pending or
               threatened, whose outcome could adversely affect title to or the
               use, occupancy or operation of the Property or Seller's ability
               to convey any of the Property to Buyer under this Agreement
               (including, without limitation, actions for condemnation).

                    (x)    No government or third-party approvals or consents
               are required for Seller's execution and delivery of, or
               performance of its obligations under, this Agreement. Seller's
               execution and performance of this Agreement do not and will not
<PAGE>


               violate, and are not restricted by, any other contractual
               obligation or any Law to which Seller is a party or by which
               Seller or any of the Property is bound.

                    (xi)  Except for Broker, Seller has not engaged or dealt

               Seller shall:

                         (A) Maintain the Property in its present condition and
                    state of repair and maintenance (subject to casualty damage
                    and to normal wear and tear) and in a manner consistent with
                    Seller's maintenance of the Property during Seller's period
                    of ownership. Seller will not remove any Tangible Personal
                    Property except as may be required for necessary repair or
                    replacement, and replacement shall be of substantially
                    similar quality and quantity as the removed item of Personal
                    Property; and

                         (B) Take reasonable measures to preserve and enforce
                    all of its rights and remedies with respect to the Property
                    and each Lease, Service Contract and Permit.

                    consent to any assignment or sublease by Tenant, without
                    Buyer's prior written consent, which (until after the
                    Approval Date) Buyer shall not unreasonably withhold or
                    delay. Buyer shall give Seller written notice of objection,
                    specifying Buyer's reasons, within five Business Days after
                    Seller has notified Buyer of such proposed action and, if
                    applicable, provided Buyer with a copy of any lease
                    agreement, amendment or other document therefor);

                         (B) Enter into, modify or terminate any Service
                    Contract with respect to the Property without Buyer's prior
                    written consent, which (until after the Approval Date) Buyer
                    shall not unreasonably withhold or delay (but Buyer shall be
                    deemed to have approved any such action unless Buyer has
                    given Seller written notice of objection, specifying Buyer's
                    reasons, within five Business Days after Seller has notified
                    Buyer of such proposed action and, if applicable, provided
                    Buyer with a copy of any agreement, amendment or other
                    document therefor); provided, however, that the foregoing
                    shall not preclude Seller from entering into any Service
                    Contract (or supplement to an existing Service Contract)
                    that will be fully performed, or otherwise terminated, by
                    Closing.

                    and exclusive possession of their leased premises, access to
                    the Property at all reasonable times for purposes of
                    conducting (at Buyer's expense and liability) any
                    examinations, surveys and tests as Buyer may reasonably
                    require; provided, however, that Buyer shall not have any
                    right to conduct any drilling, boring or other intrusive or
                    destructive testing of the Property without the prior
                    written consent of Seller, which shall not be unreasonably
                    withheld, conditioned or delayed.

                         (xv) During the period from the Effective Date until
                    Closing, Seller shall not knowingly and voluntarily (A)
                    create any Lien or any other new exceptions to Seller's
                    title to the Real Property (except the Revised CCRs) or (B)
                    commit any other act, except acts required or permitted
                    hereunder, that would result in any of the warranties or
                    representations contained in this Section not being
                    materially true or correct as of Closing.

                    Buyer's execution and performance of this Agreement do not
                    and will not violate, and are not restricted by, any other
                    contractual obligation or applicable Law to which Buyer is a

                         (iii) There are no lawsuits pending and served against
                    Buyer or, to Buyer's knowledge, otherwise pending or
                    threatened, whose outcome could adversely affect Buyer's
                    ability to purchase the Property under this Agreement.

                    the transaction contemplated by this Agreement.

                         (v)  Buyer and its management have extensive experience
                    and sophistication in the acquisition and operation of

                         (vi) BUYER'S PURCHASE OF THE PROPERTY HEREUNDER WILL BE
                    "AS-IS, WHERE-IS, WITH ALL FAULTS" AND, EXCEPT FOR THE
                    WARRANTIES, REPRESENTATIONS AND COVENANTS OF SELLER

                    AND INVESTIGATION OF THE PROPERTY AND ON DOCUMENTS AND OTHER
                    MATERIALS RELATED TO THE PROPERTY. WITHOUT LIMITING THE
                    FOREGOING, BUYER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT, EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET
                    FORTH IN SECTION 3.2.1, SELLER HAS NOT MADE ANY
                    REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES ON WHICH BUYER IS RELYING AS
                    TO ANY MATTERS CONCERNING THE PROPERTY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT

                    WITH, OR ARE RELATED TO: (A) ANY PAST, PRESENT OR FUTURE
                    CONDITION OF OR ACTIONS ON OR ABOUT THE PROPERTY, INCLUDING,
                    WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE PRESENCE OF HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES AT
                    THE PROPERTY, WHETHER OR NOT CAUSED BY SELLER, (B) ANY AND

                    ENCROACHMENTS WHICH AFFECT THE PROPERTY.

                    BUYER HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT (i) BUYER MAY
                    HEREAFTER DISCOVER FACTS DIFFERENT FROM OR IN ADDITION TO
                    THOSE NOW (OR AS OF THE CLOSING) KNOWN OR BELIEVED TO BE
                    TRUE REGARDING THE PROPERTY AND/OR PROPERTY INFORMATION,
                    (ii) BUYER'S AGREEMENT TO RELEASE, ACQUIT AND DISCHARGE
                    SELLER AND SELLER PARTIES AS SET FORTH HEREIN SHALL REMAIN
                    IN FULL FORCE AND EFFECT, NOTWITHSTANDING THE EXISTENCE OR

                    (iii) BUYER KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY WAIVES ANY AND ALL
                    RIGHTS, BENEFITS AND PRIVILEGES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT
                    PERMISSIBLE UNDER ANY FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL, OR OTHER LAWS

                    COUNSEL AS TO THE IMPLICATIONS AND RISKS OF THE FOREGOING
                    RELEASE AND WAIVER AND HAS TAKEN SUCH RISKS INTO ACCOUNT IN
                    SETTING THE PURCHASE PRICE.

                    NOTHING IN THIS SECTION 3.2.2 IS INTENDED TO RELEASE SELLER
                    FROM CLAIMS FOR BREACH OF ITS WARRANTIES, REPRESENTATIONS
                    AND COVENANTS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT OR IN

                    due diligence reasonably required to apprise Buyer of the
                    suitability of the Property and its suitability for Buyer's
                    purposes, taking into account the disclaimers and waivers
                    set forth in this Section 3.2.2.

          3.2.3 SURVIVAL. Except as provided below, the foregoing warranties,
     representations and covenants (and the Parties' respective liability for
     any breach thereof) shall survive Closing and shall not be deemed to merge
     in the Deed or any other instrument. Notwithstanding any other provision of
     this Agreement or Seller's Closing Documents, any claim based on a breach
     of Seller's representations and warranties in Section 3.2.1 or in Seller's
     Closing Certificate shall be forever barred, and Buyer shall bring no
     action thereon, unless:

               3.2.3.1 The facts constituting such breach have not been
          disclosed to, discovered by or otherwise become known to Buyer prior
          to Closing;

               3.2.3.2 Buyer's actual out-of-pocket loss from such breach
          exceeds $25,000; in no event, however, shall Seller's liability from
          all breaches of Seller's representations herein exceed $300,000; and

               3.2.3.3 Buyer commences action on such claim within one year

                    the Property, including (without limitation) the water-tight
                    integrity of the Improvements, the condition of all power
                    and mechanical systems in the Improvements and the general
                    state of repair of the Property);

                         (iii) The status and adequacy of the Permits;

     material respects, as of Closing, of each of the warranties and
     representations of Seller set forth in Section 3.2.1, subject to only
     changes which are required or permitted hereunder.

          3.3.4 SATISFACTORY TITLE. The Title Company's commitment as of Closing
     to issue the Title Policy in accordance with Section 2.7.2.

          3.3.5 SUFFICIENT TENANT ESTOPPEL CERTIFICATES. Buyer shall have
     received, at least ten Business Days prior to the Last Closing Date, signed
     Tenant Estoppel Certificates from the Tenants under Leases aggregating at
     least 90% of by rentable area of all the Leases, addressed to Buyer,
     Buyer's lender and their successors, and assigns, dated no earlier than ten
     days prior to the Approval Date and containing no statement that, in the
     reasonable judgment of Buyer or Buyer's lender, is materially and adversely
     inconsistent with the Lease documents and other written Lease and Tenant
     information that Seller has provided to Buyer prior to the Approval Date
     pursuant to Section 3.1.1. Buyer shall be deemed to have approved, as
     counting toward satisfying the condition of this Section 3.3.5, each Tenant
     Estoppel Certificate delivered to it unless Buyer, within five Business
     Days after receiving such Certificate (or a true and complete copy,
     including a fax copy, thereof), objects to the same in a written notice to
     Seller, specifying the basis for Buyer's objection.

     Exhibit P. Buyer shall be deemed to have approved, as counting toward
     satisfying the condition of this Section 3.3.6, each SANDA delivered to it
     unless Buyer, within five Business Days after receiving such Certificate
     (or a true and complete copy, including a fax copy, thereof), objects to
     the same in a written notice to Seller, specifying the basis for Buyer's
     objection.

<PAGE>


          3.3.7 MATERIAL LITIGATION. There shall exist no pending or threatened
     actions, suits, arbitrations, claims, attachments, assignments for the
     benefit of creditors, insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or other
     proceedings against Seller that would materially and adversely affect the
     operation or value of the Property or Seller's ability to perform its
     obligations under this Agreement.

The condition specified in Section 3.3.1 shall be deemed waived unless Buyer has
given Seller written notice terminating this Agreement, by reason of the failure
of such condition, by 5:00 p.m., Pacific Time, on the Approval Date. If any
other of the foregoing conditions is not timely satisfied (or waived by Buyer in
writing), Buyer shall have the right to terminate this Agreement before Closing
by written notice of such termination to Seller and Escrow Agent given at any
time prior to the satisfaction of such condition; but once Closing has occurred
all of the foregoing conditions, to the extent not satisfied at Closing, shall
be deemed to have been waived. If Seller gives Buyer written notice that either
of the conditions specified in Sections 3.3.3 and 3.3.7 will not be satisfied by
Closing, then (so long as such failure of condition is not the result of a
willful breach on the part of Seller of any of its covenants or warranties under
this Agreement) Seller shall have the right to terminate this Agreement unless
Buyer, within five Business Days after receiving such notice from Seller, waives
in a written notice to Seller the condition in question (provided, however, that
such termination shall not excuse Seller from liability to Buyer for monetary
damages if such failure of condition results from a breach on the part of
Seller, whether or not willful). If either of the conditions specified in
Sections 3.3.5 and 3.3.6 are not satisfied by the tenth Business Day prior to
the Last Closing Date (the "Estoppel Deadline"), Buyer shall have the right to
terminate this Agreement by giving Seller written notice of such termination by
5:00 p.m. Pacific Time on the Estoppel Deadline; but Buyer shall be deemed to
have waived both such conditions if it has not so terminated this Agreement by
such time on the Estoppel Deadline.

     3.4 CONDITIONS TO SELLER'S OBLIGATION. Seller's obligation to close Escrow
shall be subject to the timely satisfaction of each of the following conditions:

          3.4.1 PERFORMANCE OF BUYER'S OBLIGATIONS. Performance by Buyer in all
     material respects of Buyer's obligations under this Agreement to be
     performed at or before Closing.

          3.4.2 ACCURACY OF WARRANTIES AND REPRESENTATIONS. The accuracy in all
     material respects, as of Closing, of each of the warranties and
     representations of Buyer set forth in Section 3.2.2.

If any of the foregoing conditions is not timely satisfied (or waived by Seller
in writing), Seller shall have the right to terminate this Agreement before
Closing by written notice of such termination to Buyer and Escrow Agent given at
any time prior to the satisfaction of such condition; but once Closing has
occurred all of the foregoing conditions, to the extent not satisfied at
Closing, shall be deemed to have been waived.

     3.5 INDEMNITIES.

          3.5.1 BUYER'S ACTIVITIES ON THE REAL PROPERTY. Buyer shall hold
     harmless, indemnify and defend Seller from and against any and all claims,

     attorneys' fees), which Seller incurs by reason of any damage to the
     Property caused by, or any third-person claim against Seller arising or
     asserted to arise out of, any activity of Buyer, or any of Buyer's agents,
     conducted on the Real Property prior to Closing provided, however, that the
     foregoing indemnity shall not extend to protect Seller from any (i)
     pre-existing liabilities for matters merely discovered by Buyer (e.g.,
     latent environmental contamination), (ii) any liabilities arising as a
     result of Seller's willful misconduct or gross negligence and (iii) any
     claims, liabilities or losses arising or asserted to arise out of any
     disclosures required by applicable law, rule or regulation promulgated by
     any governmental agency with jurisdiction over Buyer or the Property. Buyer
     shall, with reasonable promptness, repair any damage caused to the Property
     by any such activity.

          3.5.2 LEASES, SERVICE CONTRACTS . Seller shall hold harmless,
     indemnify and defend Buyer from and against any and all claims and
     liability, and expenses related thereto (including reasonable attorneys'
     fees), which Buyer incurs by reason of any alleged default on the part of
     the landlord under the Lease, as vendee under a Service Contract based upon
     an event or condition occurring (or alleged to have occurred) prior to
     Closing. Buyer shall hold harmless, indemnify and defend Seller from and
     against any and all claims and liability, and expenses related thereto
     (including reasonable attorneys' fees), which Seller incurs by reason of
     any alleged default on the part of the landlord under a Lease, as vendee
     under a Service Contract, based upon an event or condition occurring (or
     alleged to have occurred) after Closing.

          3.5.3 LEASING COMMISSIONS. Seller shall pay, and shall hold harmless,
     indemnify and defend Buyer from and against any claims or liability for,
     leasing commissions which are or before Closing become due and payable
     under any leasing commission or leasing agency agreement which Seller has
     entered into, with respect to any Lease made (i) prior to the Effective
     Date or (ii) after the Effective Date other than in accordance with Section
     3.2.1(xiii)(A). Buyer shall pay, and shall hold harmless, indemnify and
     defend Seller from and against any claims or liability for, leasing
     commissions which become due and payable after Closing (including, without
     limitation, any commissions which become due under any such agreement by
     reason of the extension, renewal or expansion after Closing of any Lease
     existing as of Closing).

          3.5.4 SURVIVAL. The provisions of, and the Parties' respective
     obligations under, this Section 3.5 shall survive Closing or termination of
     this Agreement. The indemnifications contained in this Section 3.5 shall
     run to the benefit of the named indemnified Party and such Party's
     shareholder(s), constituent partners, directors, officers, employees,
     agents, successors and assigns.

     3.6 DAMAGE, DESTRUCTION OR CONDEMNATION.

          3.6.1 TERMINATION RIGHTS. If, prior to Closing, the Property suffers
     any material damage, destruction or taking by eminent domain (a "Material
     Casualty"), either Party shall have the right, at its election, to
     terminate this Agreement, by written notice given to the other Party within
     ten Business Days after receiving notice of such Material Casualty (or, if
     sooner, by the Last Closing Date). If a Material Casualty occurs fewer than
     ten Business Days before the Last Closing Date, either Party shall have the
     right to extend the Last Closing Date until the tenth Business Day after
     the occurrence of such Material Casualty in order to make the election
     permitted by this Section.

          3.6.2 IF NO TERMINATION. In the event that a Material Casualty or any
     other damage, destruction or taking of the Property by eminent domain
     occurs and neither Party has or elects to exercise a permitted right to
     terminate this Agreement, this Agreement shall continue in force and, upon
     Closing, Buyer shall be entitled to all insurance proceeds (other than
     proceeds of rent loss or business interruption insurance which are
     allocable to periods before Closing), condemnation awards or other amounts
     which have been paid or may thereafter be payable to Seller by any person
     in connection with such Casualty ("Proceeds"), and at Closing Seller shall
     pay over to Buyer the amount of any Proceeds already received by Seller
     (except to the extent expended by Seller to repair or restore the
     Property), assign Buyer all of Seller's rights to Proceeds which may then
     be or thereafter become payable and credit Buyer with an amount equal to
     the least of (A) the "deductible" under the applicable property hazard
     insurance policy or (B) the reasonably estimated cost of repairing or
     restoring the Property.

          3.6.3 MATERIALITY. For purposes of this Section 3.6, a material
     Casualty is one in which the extent of the damage, destruction or taking
     (measured by the cost of repairing or replacing the damaged, destroyed or
     taken portion of the Property) exceeds ten percent of the Purchase Price.

     3.7 ASSIGNMENT BY BUYER. Prior to Closing, Buyer shall have the right to
assign this Agreement to a corporation or other entity controlling, controlled
by or under common control with Buyer, by delivering to Seller a written
assignment and assumption agreement under which the assignee assumes all of
Buyer's obligations under this Agreement. For purposes hereof, "control" means
the direct or indirect (A) ownership of more than 50% of the capital and profits
interest, coupled with (B) the right to elect a majority of the board of directs
or similarly direct such entity. Except as provided in the foregoing sentence,
Buyer shall have no right to assign or transfer its rights under this Agreement
except with Seller's prior written consent, which Seller may withhold in its
sole and absolute discretion. Seller shall have no obligation to respect any
assignment in violation of this Section and such an assignment shall constitute
a material breach of this Agreement on the part of Buyer. No assignment shall
relieve or excuse Buyer of its obligations and liability hereunder. Seller's
consent to any one assignment shall not be deemed consent to any other
assignment or a waiver of the requirement for its consent to any other
assignment.

<PAGE>


     3.8 TERMINATION.

          3.8.1 BY BUYER. If Buyer has and timely exercises any right hereunder
     to terminate this Agreement, Buyer shall be immediately entitled to the
     return of the Deposit and, promptly upon receiving notice of such
     termination, Seller shall join with Buyer in a written notice to Escrow
     Agent acknowledging the termination of this Agreement and instructing
     Escrow Agent to return the Deposit to Buyer and to return all other funds
     and every other item deposited in Escrow to the Party which deposited the
     same.

          3.8.2 BY SELLER. If Seller has, and timely exercises, the right to
     terminate this Agreement for a breach by Buyer of its obligation hereunder
     to close the purchase of the Property, promptly upon receiving notice of
     such termination Buyer shall join with Seller in a written notice to Escrow
     Agent acknowledging the termination of this Agreement and instructing the
     Title Company to deliver the Deposit to Seller and to return all other
     funds and every other item deposited in Escrow to the Party which deposited
     the same. If Seller terminates this Agreement for any other reason, Seller
     shall promptly, upon Buyer's written request, join with Buyer in a written
     notice to Escrow Agent acknowledging the termination of this Agreement and
     instructing Escrow Agent to return the Deposit to Buyer and to return all
     other funds and every other item deposited in Escrow to the Party which
     deposited the same.

          3.8.3 EFFECT OF TERMINATION. Upon any termination of this Agreement,
     neither Party shall have any further obligation or liability to the other
     hereunder except (i) any remaining obligation or liability of Buyer under
     Section 3.1.3 (for return, destruction and/or delivery of documents to
     Seller) or under Section 3.5.1 (with respect to activities of Buyer or its
     agents upon the Real Property), (ii) any liability which either Party may
     have hereunder by reason of the fact that such termination either (A) was
     wrongfully made by it or (B) resulted from a breach of its warranties,
     covenants or other obligations hereunder, and (iii) any obligation under
     Section 3.11.

     3.9 BROKERAGE COMMISSION. Upon Closing, Seller shall pay any commission due
to Broker on the sale of the Property under a separate, written agreement
between Seller and Broker. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to make
Broker a third-party beneficiary of this Agreement or to create any obligation
on the part of either Party to close the sale and purchase of the Property for
Broker's benefit. Each Party shall hold harmless, indemnify and defend the other
from and against any claim or liability for a commission, fee or other
compensation to any broker, salesman, finder or similar intermediary, and for
any expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and
expenses) related to the defense of any such claim, where such claim constitutes
a breach of such Party's applicable representation in Section 3.2.1 or Section
3.2.2.

     3.10 POST-CLOSING PRORATIONS AND ADJUSTMENTS. For a period of one year
after Closing, the Parties shall make the following additional prorations and
settlements:

<PAGE>


          3.10.1 LEASE PAYMENTS.

               3.10.1.1 PRIOR PERIOD RENTS. If collected or received by Buyer
          after Closing, Buyer shall pay over to Seller, within ten Business
          Days after receipt, any monthly rent or other payment which was due
          for a period beginning prior to Closing (including, without
          limitation, Seller's prorated share of any monthly rent due for the
          month in which Closing occurs) or which was due and payable prior to
          Closing, but Buyer shall have no obligation to commence legal action,
          or incur any material liability, loss or expense to collect any such
          reimbursements or other payments and Buyer shall be entitled to apply
          amounts which it receives or collects from the Tenant first to rents
          and other amounts due at the time of such collection under the Lease
          for periods beginning after Closing, next to such rents or other
          amounts for the period during which Closing occurred and, last, to
          such rents and other amounts owing for periods ending before Closing.

               3.10.1.2 EXPENSE PASS-THROUGHS. Following the end of this
          calendar year, Buyer shall timely and diligently prepare and deliver
          to the Tenants (with copies to Seller) the operating expense and
          property tax reconciliation statements for 2002 and shall use
          commercially reasonable efforts to collect any additional amounts for
          such expenses and taxes that are owned by Tenants for 2002. With
          respect to each Lease in effect as of Closing, any amount owing,
          whether to or by the Tenant, on account of such reconciliation shall
          be prorated between Seller and Buyer as of Closing. If owed by the
          Tenant, Buyer shall pay Seller its prorated share of such amount
          within ten Business Days after collecting the same; if owed to the
          Tenant, Seller shall pay Buyer its prorated share of such amount
          within 30 days after receiving Seller's written statement therefor. If
          Buyer after Closing increases the monthly amounts payable by Tenants
          on account of 2002 operating expenses and property taxes, such
          increases shall be disregarded for purposes of this provision and
          Seller shall receive (or pay) the prorated amount that would have been
          due to or from Seller had no such increase been made. Buyer shall give
          Seller prompt written notice of any such increase.

               3.10.1.3 OTHER EXPENSE REIMBURSEMENT. Any direct expense
          reimbursement or charge (such as for after-hours of HVAC) due Seller
          under a Lease as of Closing shall remain the property of Seller and
          Buyer, upon receiving any payment of such a reimbursement or charge
          shall promptly remit the same to Seller.

          3.10.2 REAL ESTATE TAXES AND ASSESSMENTS. If Closing prorations of
     real estate taxes and assessments are based on other than the current
     year's tax bill, within 30 days after such bill is issued to Buyer, Buyer
     shall recompute such proration. If such recomputation results in a larger
     proration credit to Seller, Buyer shall pay Seller the additional amount
     due Seller within such 30 days. If such recomputation results in a larger
     proration credit to Buyer, Seller shall pay Buyer the additional amount due
     Buyer within 30 days after receiving Buyer's written recomputation of such
     proration, accompanied by a copy of such tax bill.

<PAGE>


          3.10.3 OTHER EXPENSES. If any other expense proration at Closing is
     based on other than a final bill, such expense proration shall be
     recomputed by Seller or Buyer (as the case may be) promptly after the final
     bill is received and the final adjustment of such proration shall be
     settled between the Parties within 30 days thereafter.

          3.10.4 REMITTAL OF POST-CLOSING RECEIPTS TO BUYER. Seller shall
     immediately remit to Buyer each check or other payment which Seller (or
     Seller's property manager) receives after Closing on account of rent or
     other amounts due under any Lease for any period ending after Closing.
     Seller shall endorse (or cause its property manager to endorse, if
     appropriate) any such checks, but without recourse. Seller hereby
     designates and appoints Buyer and Buyer's property manager its
     attorney-in-fact after Closing to endorse any checks payable to Seller
     received by Buyer on account of rent or other amounts due under any Lease.

          3.10.5 DETERMINATIONS OF POST-CLOSING PRORATIONS AND ADJUSTMENTS.
     Except where expressly provided otherwise, Buyer shall make the required
     determinations and computations of all post-Closing prorations and other
     adjustments under this Section 3.10 (the "Post-Closing Prorations") and
     shall provide Seller with a reasonably detailed written summary of each
     Post-Closing Proration, concurrently with or prior to making any payment to
     or requesting any payment from Seller under this Section 3.10 with respect
     thereto. Neither Party shall be obligated to make any adjustment payment
     with respect to any item unless it has received written notice from the
     other Party of such adjustment, with all supporting documentation, prior to
     the first anniversary of Closing.

     3.11 CONFIDENTIALITY. The following provisions shall apply to all
documents, data, materials and other information regarding the Property (other
than information available from public records or otherwise generally available
to the public) that Seller furnishes, or causes to be furnished to Buyer (the
"Private Information"), regardless whether furnished prior to, concurrently with
or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement, except to the extent such
information is obtained from other sources.

          3.11.1 DISCLOSURE PURPOSE. The Private Information is furnished to
     Buyer solely to assist Buyer in its due diligence with respect to the
     Property (the "Disclosure Purpose") and without warranty or representation
     of any kind, except as expressly set forth in this Agreement. Buyer shall
     use the Private Information only for the Disclosure Purpose.

          3.11.2 CONFIDENTIALITY OBLIGATIONS. Buyer shall treat the Private
     Information as confidential and shall not disclose Private Information to
     any person, other than any employees, attorneys, accountants and other
     consultants whom Buyer engages to assist in evaluating the Property and to
     prospective lenders and such lender's employees, attorneys and consultants
     (altogether, "Buyer Parties") and as may be required under applicable laws,
     rules or regulations promulgated by any governmental agency with
     jurisdiction over Buyer or the Property. Buyer shall advise each Buyer
     Party to whom Buyer discloses any of the Private Information of the
     confidentiality requirements of this Section 3.11 and obtain from such
     person an undertaking to respect the confidentiality of the Private
     Information and make no further disclosures of any such information, except
     in accordance herewith. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
     Buyer shall not disclose, and shall use reasonable efforts to prevent any

<PAGE>


     of the other Buyer Parties from disclosing, any of the Private Information
     concerning present or prospective tenants of the Property, the rent or
     other terms of any existing or proposed Lease, or the operating expenses of
     the Property to any person who is regularly engaged in soliciting tenants,
     or representing tenants or landlords in leasing transactions, within the
     greater Phoenix, Arizona metropolitan area. The foregoing shall not be
     deemed to prevent Buyer from making any disclosure that Buyer is required
     by law to make; but prior to making any such disclosure Buyer shall give
     Seller such prior written notice, specifying the information required to be
     disclosed, the basis of the legal obligation to disclose and the party(ies)
     to whom disclosure will be made, as applicable law and circumstances
     reasonably permit and Seller shall have whatever opportunity applicable law
     provides to contest the requirement for such disclosure or to limit the
     same.

          3.11.3 NO COMMUNICATIONS WITH TENANTS. Buyer shall not, and shall not
     permit any Buyer Party to, directly or indirectly contact any current or
     prospective tenant of the Property, without Seller's prior written approval
     which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Seller
     may condition any such contact on Seller's having a representative present
     and on such contact it being made at a time and place, and in a manner,
     reasonably convenient to such representative.

          3.11.4 REMEDIES. Buyer acknowledges that a breach of its covenants in
     this Section 3.11 could result in substantial injury to Seller, that
     monetary damages will not adequately compensate Seller and Seller for any
     material such breach and that Seller shall be entitled to prompt injunctive
     relief in the event of such a breach. The foregoing, however, shall not be
     construed to preclude Seller from recovering monetary damages from Buyer as
     well.

          3.11.5 DURATION OF THESE CONFIDENTIALITY PROVISIONS. Buyer's
     obligations under this Section 3.11 shall cease upon Closing but if Closing
     does not occur, Buyers obligations under this Section 3.11 shall survive
     for a period of one year.

     3.12 No Disclosure of Sale Terms. Except to persons to whom Buyer may
disclose Private Information under Section 3.11.2 and except for any required
filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") under the Securities
and Exchange Act of 1934 and regulations pursuant thereto, Buyer shall not, and
shall not permit any Buyer Party to, communicate to anyone the terms of this
Agreement prior to Closing. Buyer shall give Seller at least five Business Days'
prior written notice of any such proposed filing with the SEC, including a copy
of the portion(s) of such proposed filing relating to this Agreement, but Seller
shall have no obligation or liability with respect to such filing. Except for
its parent shareholder (and such shareholder's board, staff and consultants),
Seller shall not communicate to anyone the terms of this Agreement prior to
Closing or the termination of this Agreement without Closing.

     3.13 ENFORCEMENT COSTS. Should either Party institute any action or
proceeding to enforce any provision of this Agreement or for damages by reason
of an alleged breach of any provision hereof, the prevailing Party shall be
entitled to receive all reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys' fees) incurred by such prevailing Party in connection with such
action or proceeding. A Party entitled to recover costs and expenses under this

<PAGE>


Section shall also be entitled to recover all costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred in the enforcement of any judgement or
settlement obtained in such action or proceeding and provision (and in any such
judgement provision shall be made for the recovery of such post-judgement costs
and expenses).

     3.14 NOTICES. Except in the case (if any) where this Agreement expressly
provides for an alternate form of communication, any notice, consent, demand or
other communication to be delivered to a Party hereunder shall be deemed
delivered and received when made in writing and transmitted to the applicable
Party either by receipted courier service, or by the United States Postal
Service, first class registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, return
receipt requested, or by electronic facsimile transmission ("Fax"), at the

          3.24.1 PROHIBITION ON SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE, LIS PENDENS . Except as
     permitted by Section 3.24.2, if Seller in breach of this Agreement fails to
     close, Buyer shall be limited to an action for monetary damages only and
     shall have no right to seek specific performance or to record a lis pendens
     against the Property. This provision shall be an absolute bar to any action
     by Buyer for specific performance of this Agreement, and Seller shall be
     entitled to an immediate expungement of any lis pendens recorded by Buyer.

<PAGE>


     If Buyer brings an action for specific performance of this Agreement, or
     records a lis pendens against the Property, Buyer shall hold harmless and
     indemnify Seller from and against all costs, expenses (including attorneys'
     fees) and losses that Seller consequently incurs.

          3.24.2 EXCEPTION FOR WILLFUL BREACH. Notwithstanding Section 3.24.1,
     in the event Seller in breach of this Agreement fails to close the sale of
     the Property, Buyer may in lieu of an action for monetary damages bring an
     action for specific performance of Seller's obligation to close, subject to
     strict compliance with each of the following conditions:

                         (i)   Buyer gives Seller at least ten Business Days'
                    prior written notice of its intention to commence such an
                    action;

                         (ii)  Buyer commences such action, and serves Seller
                    with a complaint therein, within 60 days after the Last
                    Closing Date;

                         (iii) Such action, to the extent seeking specific
                    performance (or other equitable relief) is limited to an
                    action to compel Seller to deliver into Escrow the Deed and
                    other Seller's Closing Documents actually required to convey
                    the Property free of Liens and to perform Seller's other
                    delivery obligations to be performed at Closing and does not
                    seek specific performance of any other covenant or warranty
                    of Seller hereunder (including, without limitation, any
                    covenant or warranty contained in Section 3.2.1) or the
                    correction of any condition respecting the Property.

                         (iv)  During the pendency of such action, the Deposit
                    remains in Escrow (or is deposited with the court hearing
                    such action);

     provided, however, that if Seller, at any time during the pendency of such
     action, delivers the Deed and other required Seller's Closing Documents
     into Escrow (or into the court before which such action is pending) and
     authorizes Closing in accordance with Section 2.7.2 (including instructions
     to Escrow Agent to apply the proceeds of the Purchase Price to the payment
     of any Lien that would otherwise appear as an exception on the Title
     Policy), Buyer shall either proceed immediately to close the purchase of
     the Property or immediately to dismiss such action to the extent it seeks
     specific performance or other equitable relief and expunge from the record
     any lis pendens Buyer has filed. By electing to seek specific performance
     under this Section 3.24.2, Buyer shall be deemed to have waived any claim
     or right to monetary damages for Seller's failure to close, other than such
     damages for delay as are customarily awarded in conjunction with specific
     performance of an obligation to sell real property (but, if such action
     results in Buyer's purchasing the Property, such waiver shall not apply to
     any claim for damages for Seller's subsequent breach of any of its
     post-Closing obligations under this Agreement). If Buyer brings or
     maintains an action for specific performance other than as expressly
     permitted under this Section 3.24.2, or fails to close the purchase of the
     Property within 30 days after Seller has delivered the Deed and other
     required Seller's Closing Documents and instructions into Escrow (or into
     such court) and authorized Closing, Seller shall have the right to
     terminate this Agreement and recover the Deposit as liquidated damages
     under Section 3.25.

     3.25 LIQUIDATED DAMAGES AND LIMITATION ON REMEDIES FOR BUYER'S BREACH. IF
BUYER IN BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT FAILS TO CLOSE, SELLER SHALL BE ENTITLED TO
TERMINATE THIS AGREEMENT AND, AS ITS SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY ON ACCOUNT OF
SUCH FAILURE (SELLER HEREBY WAIVING ALL OTHER RIGHTS AND REMEDIES, WHETHER
ARISING AT LAW OR IN EQUITY) AND IN CONSIDERATION OF ITS WITHDRAWAL OF THE
PROPERTY FROM THE MARKET DURING THE TERM OF THIS AGREEMENT, TO RECEIVE AND
RETAIN, AS LIQUIDATED DAMAGES, THE DEPOSIT; AND SELLER SPECIFICALLY WAIVES ANY
RIGHT SPECIFICALLY TO ENFORCE BUYER'S OBLIGATION HEREUNDER TO PURCHASE THE
PROPERTY. BY INITIALING BELOW, THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT:

          3.25.1 BUYER'S WRONGFUL FAILURE TO CLOSE WILL CAUSE SELLER TO INCUR
     LOSSES AND OTHER DAMAGES IN AN AMOUNT THAT WOULD BE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO
     ASCERTAIN.

          3.25.2 THE DEPOSIT (INCLUDING INTEREST EARNED THEREON) BEARS A
     REASONABLE RELATIONSHIP TO THE DAMAGES WHICH THE PARTIES ESTIMATE SELLER
     WILL SUFFER BY REASON OF BUYER'S WRONGFUL FAILURE TO CLOSE AND IS NOT AN
     UNREASONABLE AMOUNT OF LIQUIDATED DAMAGES UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES EXISTING
     AT THE TIME THIS AGREEMENT IS MADE.

          3.25.3 SUCH LIQUIDATED DAMAGES ARE ALSO REASONABLE CONSIDERATION FOR
     SELLER'S AGREEMENT TO LIMIT ITS REMEDIES AGAINST BUYER FOR SUCH A FAILURE
     TO CLOSE.

          3.25.4 BUYER HAS FULLY CONSIDERED THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION 3.25
     AND HAS CONSULTED WITH ITS LEGAL COUNSEL WITH RESPECT THERETO.

THE FOREGOING SHALL NOT, HOWEVER, LIMIT SELLER'S RIGHTS AND REMEDIES TO ENFORCE
OBLIGATIONS OF BUYER UNDER SECTIONS 3.1.3, 3.5.1 AND 3.11 (INCLUDING COSTS OF
ENFORCING THIS LIQUIDATED DAMAGES PROVISION) OR, IF CLOSING OCCURS, TO ENFORCE
ANY OTHER OBLIGATIONS OF BUYER HEREUNDER.

THE PARTIES HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGE THEIR SPECIFIC AGREEMENT TO THE FOREGOING
LIQUIDATED DAMAGES PROVISION BY INITIALING BELOW.
