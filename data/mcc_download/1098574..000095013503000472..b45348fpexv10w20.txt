                                    RECITALS

     A.   Landlord's predecessor, Premier Drive Properties, L.L.C., and Tenant
are parties to that certain Lease Agreement dated December 2, 1998, as amended
by that certain Lease Amendment dated March 16, 2000 (as amended, the "Lease")
governing certain office space (the "Premises") located in the building at 1983
Premier Drive (the "Building) in the City of Mankato, Minnesota.

     B.   Landlord has agreed to reduce the area in the Building leased to
Tenant by 9,163 square feet, such that the area thereafter leased by Tenant will
be 13,504 square feet (or approximately 21% of the total space in the Building),
and the parties have agreed to adjust the base rent and Tenant's share of
Additional Rent payable under the Lease.

     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises set forth herein
and other good and valuable consideration, the parties agree as follows:

     1.   Reduction of Leased Premises. Landlord and Tenant hereby agree to
reduce the area leased to Tenant under the Lease by 9,163 square feet such that
the area thereafter leased by Tenant will be 13,504 square feet (or
approximately 21% of the total space in the Building), effective February 1,
2002, on which date the Premises occupied under the Lease shall be as shown on
Exhibit A attached hereto.

     2.   Rent Decrease. From and after February 1, 2002, the base rent paid by
Tenant and Tenant's share of Additional Rent shall be decreased to reflect the
space removed from the Premises by this Second Amendment.

     3.   No Further Changes. All other terms and provisions of the Lease shall
remain unchanged and in full force and effect.

     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Second Amendment as of
