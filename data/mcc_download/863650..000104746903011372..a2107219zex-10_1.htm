Information</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>" does not include information that has become a part of the public domain by the act of one who has the right to disclose such information without violating any
right of the Company or the customer to which such information pertains. Confidential Information which is specific as to techniques, methods, or the like shall not be deemed to be in the public

protective order or other appropriate remedy and/or waive compliance with the terms of this Agreement. In the event that such protective order or other remedy is not obtained or the Company waives
compliance with the provisions hereof, the Executive agrees to furnish only that portion of the Confidential Information that is legally required and to exercise reasonable efforts to obtain an
assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded such Confidential Information. </FONT></P>

on Executive's own time and with Executive's own resources, anything that may be considered Work Product but to which Executive believes Executive should be entitled to the personal benefit of,
Executive shall be required to follow the clearance procedure set forth in this section in order to ensure that Company has no claim to the proprietary rights that may arise. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before
Executive begins any development work on Executive's own time, Executive must give Company advance written notice of Executive's plans and supply a description of the development
under consideration. Unless otherwise agreed in a writing signed by Company prior to receipt, Company shall have no obligation of confidence with respect to such description. Company will determine,
in good faith, within thirty (30)&nbsp;days after Executive has fully disclosed Executive's plans to Company, whether the development is claimed by Company as Work Product. If Company determines
that it does not claim such development, Executive will be notified in writing and may retain ownership of the development to the extent of what has been disclosed to Company. Executive should submit
for further clearance any significant improvement, modification, or adaptation so that it can be determined whether the improvement, modification, or adaptation relates to the business or interests of
Company. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearance
under this procedure does not relieve Executive of the need to obtain the written consent of Company before engaging in business activities or rendering business, commercial,
or professional services for the benefit of anyone other than Company, as required in Section&nbsp;1.1 hereof. Company thus reserves the right to exercise greater control over development work that
Executive might consider doing for profit after hours, as opposed to mere hobby work pursued in Executive's spare time. </FONT></P>

Agreement is an essential condition to Executive's employment, and the Company is depending upon absolute compliance. Damages would probably be very difficult to ascertain if Executive breached any
covenant in this Agreement. This Agreement is intended to protect the proprietary rights of Company in many important ways. Even the threat of any misuse of the technology of Company would be
extremely harmful, since that technology is essential to the business of Company. In light of these facts, Executive agrees that any court of competent jurisdiction may immediately enjoin any breach
