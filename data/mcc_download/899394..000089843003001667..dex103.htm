entitled to protect and enforce its rights, including without limitation the rights arising out of this Agreement, and it shall not be necessary for any other Purchaser to be joined as an additional party in any proceeding for such purpose. Each
Purchaser was introduced to the Company by SG Cowen Securities Corporation, which has acted solely as agent for the Company and not for any Purchaser. Each Purchaser has been represented by its own separate legal counsel in their review and
negotiation of the Transaction Documents. For reasons of administrative convenience only, Purchasers and their respective counsel have chosen to communicate with the Company through Purchaser&#146;s Counsel. Purchaser&#146;s Counsel does not
represent all of the Purchasers but only Midsummer Investment, Ltd. The Company has elected to provide all Purchasers with the same terms and Transaction Documents for the convenience of the Company and not because it was required or requested to do
so by the Purchasers. </FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px" ALIGN="center"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000">********************
