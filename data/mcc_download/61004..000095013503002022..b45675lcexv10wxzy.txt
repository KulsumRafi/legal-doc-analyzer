Borrower of the amount of such drawing and the date on which the payment thereof
is to be made by the Lender to the beneficiary (but the Lender's failure to give
any such notice shall not affect the Borrower's Reimbursement Obligations
hereunder). The Borrower agrees to reimburse the Lender for the amount of each
drawing made under any Letter of Credit which is honored by the Lender, which
reimbursement shall be made in full at or prior to the time the Lender pays such
drawing (but in the event the Lender fails to give the Borrower the aforesaid
prior notice of its intended payment of any such

                                      -18-

<PAGE>

drawing, such reimbursement shall not be due until the Lender gives the Borrower
notice of Lender's payment of such drawing). In the event Borrower fails to
honor when due its Reimbursement Obligations with respect to a drawing under any
Letter of Credit, the Lender may, at its option, make a Loan on Borrower's
behalf to refinance such Reimbursement Obligations (and such Loan shall be a
Non-Guaranteed Loan if such Letter of Credit is a Non-Guaranteed Letter of
Credit and an Exim-Guaranteed Loan if such Letter of Credit is an
Exim-Guaranteed Letter of Credit), but Lender shall not be under any obligation
to make any such Loan to refinance any such Reimbursement Obligations.

                  (c)      Accrued interest on any of the Reimbursement
Obligations shall be payable at the same time as is due the payment of principal
of such Reimbursement Obligation.

                  (d)      Each Letter of Credit shall expire no later than 360
days after the issuance thereof; provided, however, that Warranty Letters of
Credit may expire no later than 390 days after the issuance thereof. On the
Maturity Date, any and all Letters of Credit having an expiration date after the
Maturity Date must be cash collateralized in accordance with the terms and
conditions of Section 10.14(ii). No Letter of Credit may be issued on a date
that is less than 30 days prior to the Maturity Date, unless the Lender in its
reasonable judgment believes that the Lender and Borrower are in good faith
negotiations to extend the Maturity Date of this Agreement. Each Letter of
Credit otherwise shall be in a form and shall have terms which are acceptable in
all respects to Lender. Each Exim-Guaranteed Letter of Credit shall comply with
the terms and conditions of the Eximbank Guarantee, the Eximbank Loan
Authorization Agreement and the Borrower Agreement.

                  SECTION 2.04.  MAXIMUM AVAILABILITY; OVERADVANCE.

                  (a)      Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, the Lender shall not be obligated to make any Loans to or on behalf of
the Borrower, and the Lender shall not be obligated to issue any Letters of
Credit for the account of the Borrower hereunder if, after giving effect to any
such transactions, the aggregate outstanding principal balance of all of the
Loans at such time plus the aggregate stated amount of all outstanding Letters
of Credit at such time shall exceed the amount of the Export-Related Borrowing
Base as then in effect.

                  (b)      In the event that the aggregate principal balance of
any of the Loans outstanding at any one time or the aggregate stated amount of
any of the Letters of Credit outstanding at any one time shall exceed any of the
applicable limits specified in Section 2.01(a) or (b) hereof or any applicable
limit specified in paragraph (a) of this Section 2.04, Borrower shall,
immediately upon Borrower's receipt of notice thereof from Lender or the
Borrower's otherwise acquiring knowledge thereof, prepay such Loans or cause the
early cancellation of such Letters of Credit to the extent necessary to
eliminate such excess.

                  (c)      In the event that the aggregate principal balance of
any of the Loans outstanding at any one time or the aggregate stated amount of
any of the Letters of Credit outstanding at any one time shall exceed any of the
applicable limits specified in Section 2.01(a) or (b) above or any applicable
limit specified in paragraph (a) of this Section 2.04, such excess

                                      -19-

<PAGE>

nevertheless shall constitute Loans or Letters of Credit (as the case may be)
for all purposes of this Agreement and the other Credit Documents and shall be
entitled to all benefits and security of this Agreement and the other Credit
Documents.

                  SECTION 2.05.  AMENDMENT AND RESTATEMENT; NO NOVATION.

         This Agreement constitutes an amendment and restatement of the Original
Credit Agreement effective from and after the Closing Date. The execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby are not intended by the parties to be, and shall not constitute, a
novation or an accord and satisfaction of the Obligations or any other
obligations owing to the Lender under the Original Credit Agreement or any other
Original Credit Document. On the Closing Date, the credit facilities and the
terms and conditions thereof described in the Original Credit Agreement shall be
amended and replaced by the credit facilities and the terms and conditions
thereof described herein, and all Loans and other Obligations of Borrower
outstanding as of such date under the Original Credit Agreement shall be deemed
to be Loans and Obligations outstanding under the corresponding facilities
described herein, without further action by any Person.

                  SECTION 2.06.  EFFECTIVENESS OF ORIGINAL LOAN DOCUMENTS.

         Borrower, Parent and each Credit Party hereby acknowledge that the
Security Documents and all other Credit Documents previously executed by
Borrower, Parent or any Credit Party and delivered to Lender are and shall
remain in full force and effect, and Borrower, Parent and each Credit Party
hereby ratifies, confirms and approves such Security Documents and such other
Credit Documents and all of the terms and provisions thereof, and agrees that
each of such Security Documents and each of such Credit Documents constitutes
the valid and binding obligation of Borrower, Parent or the Credit Party, as
applicable, enforceable by the Lender in accordance with its terms.

                  SECTION 2.07.  EXTENSION OF MATURITY DATE. Not earlier than 60
days and not later than 45 days prior to the existing Maturity Date, the
Borrower may request in writing that the Lender extend the Maturity Date for an
additional period of time to be mutually agreed upon by the parties. The Lender,
in its sole discretion, may agree to extend or decline to extend the Maturity
Date; provided, however, that if the Lender does not respond in writing to such
request from the Borrower 30 days prior to the existing Maturity Date, then the
Borrower's request for an extension shall be deemed to have been denied by the
Lender.

                                  ARTICLE III.

     EXPORT-RELATED BORROWING BASE, EXPORT CONTRACTS AND DOMESTIC CONTRACTS

                  SECTION 3.01.  EXPORT-RELATED BORROWING BASE MATTERS.

                                      -20-

<PAGE>

                  (a)      The Export-Related Borrowing Base and the asset
values and credit margins incorporated therein shall be used solely for the
purposes of this Agreement and the credit facilities provided by the Lender to
the Borrower hereunder and shall not prejudice the Lender's right to allege and
prove in any bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar proceeding involving
Borrower a different value of the assets of the Borrower nor shall they be
construed to be an admission by the Lender as to what collateral levels would
adequately protect its interests in any such bankruptcy, insolvency or other
similar proceeding involving Borrower.

                  (b)      With respect to all Export-Related Accounts
Receivable, Borrower represents and warrants to Lender that Lender may rely, in
determining which Export-Related Accounts Receivable are Eligible Export-Related
Accounts Receivable, on all statements and representations made by Borrower with
respect to any Export-Related Accounts Receivable, and, unless otherwise
indicated in writing to Lender, that with respect to each Export-Related Account
Receivable:

         (i)      It is genuine and in all respects what it purports to be, and
                  it is not evidenced by a note, instrument or judgment;

         (ii)     It arises out of a bona fide sale and delivery of goods or
                  rendition of services by Borrower in the ordinary course of
                  its business and is due and owing in accordance with the terms
                  and conditions of the related contract between the Borrower
                  and the applicable Account Debtor and all purchase orders or
                  other documents relating thereto;

         (iii)    It is for a liquidated amount payable in U.S. Dollars and is
                  due as stated in the duplicate invoice covering such sale or
                  rendition of services, a copy of which has been furnished or
                  is available to Lender;

         (iv)     Such Export-Related Account Receivable, and Lender's security
                  interest therein, is not, and will not be in the future,
                  subject to any offset, Lien (other than in favor of Lender),
                  deduction, defense, dispute, or counterclaim except for
                  disputes where the amount in controversy is deemed by Lender
                  to be immaterial, and each such Export-Related Account
                  Receivable is absolutely owing to Borrower and is not
                  contingent in any material respect;

         (v)      Borrower has made no agreement with any Account Debtor for any
                  deduction therefrom, except discounts or allowances which are
                  granted by Borrower in the ordinary course of its business for
                  prompt payment and which are reflected in the calculation of
                  the net amount of each respective invoice related thereto;

         (vi)     There are no facts, events or occurrences which in any way
                  impair the validity or enforceability thereof or tend to
                  reduce the amount payable thereunder from the net face amount
                  of the invoice and statements delivered to Lender with respect
                  thereto; and

                                      -21-

<PAGE>

         (vii)    Borrower has no knowledge of any fact or circumstance which
                  would impair the validity or collectability of such
                  Export-Related Account Receivable, and to the best of
                  Borrower's knowledge there are no proceedings or actions which
                  are threatened or pending against any Account Debtor
                  thereunder which might result in any material adverse change
                  in the collectability of such Export-Related Account
                  Receivable.

                  (c)      Borrower shall keep accurate and complete records of
all Accounts Receivable and all payments and collections thereon.

                  (d)      Borrower shall cause all Accounts Receivable to be
directly paid to or deposited in a depository account with Lender. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence, all Accounts Receivable
related to Export Contracts must be directly paid to or deposited in the
Lender's Account. Lender agrees that it will remit funds from the Lender's
Account to an unrestricted account of the Borrower maintained with Lender upon
the request of Borrower unless and until: (1) a Default or Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing or (2) Lender reasonably believes based on
information available to it that an outstanding Letter of Credit may be
presented for drawing under a particular Export Contract. Upon an Event of
Default, Lender may in its discretion apply all amounts in any deposit account
maintained with Lender against the Obligations in the manner set forth in this
Agreement. Lender has no duty to protect, insure, collect or realize upon the
Accounts Receivable or preserve rights in them.

                  (e)      With respect to Export-Related Inventory, Borrower
represents and warrants to Lender that Lender may rely, in determining which
item or items of Export-Related Inventory constitute Eligible Export-Related
Inventory, on all statements and representations made by Borrower with respect
to such Inventory and, unless otherwise indicated in writing to Lender, that:

         (i)      Such Export-Related Inventory is presently and will continue
                  to be located at Borrower's places of business listed in the
                  Security Agreement and will not be removed therefrom except as
                  authorized by the Security Agreement;

         (ii)     Such Export-Related Inventory is not now, nor shall such
                  Export-Related Inventory at any time or times hereafter be,
                  stored with a bailee, warehouseman or similar party without
                  Lender's prior written consent and, if Lender gives such
                  consent, Borrower will concurrently therewith cause any such
                  bailee, warehouseman, or similar party to issue and deliver to
                  Lender, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Lender,
                  warehouse receipts therefor in Lender's name; and

         (iii)    Such Export-Related Inventory is not now, nor shall such
                  Export-Related Inventory at any time or times hereafter be,
                  delivered by or on behalf of Borrower to any third party for
                  the purpose of being processed by such third party without
                  Lender's prior written consent and, if Lender gives such
                  consent, Borrower will concurrently therewith cause such third
                  party to

                                      -22-

<PAGE>

                  agree in writing in favor of Lender (which agreement must be
                  in form and substance satisfactory to Lender) that such
                  third party will not assert any processor's or other Lien
                  against such Export-Related Inventory, that such third party
                  acknowledges that Lender holds a first-priority and
                  perfected security interest in such Export-Related Inventory
                  pursuant to the Security Agreement, and that such third
                  party will turn such Export-Related Inventory over to Lender
                  upon Lender's request therefor.

                  SECTION 3.02.  EXPORT CONTRACTS AND DOMESTIC CONTRACTS. The
Borrower shall promptly deliver to Lender a copy of each Export Contract and
each Domestic Contract together with a certificate from the president, chief
executive officer, chief financial officer or controller of Borrower certifying
that such copy is a true, correct and complete copy of such Export Contract or
Domestic Contract, as applicable, and has not been amended, restated or
terminated as of the date of such certificate.

                  SECTION 3.03.  DENOMINATION OF EXPORT TRANSACTIONS. The
Borrower shall require payment under any and all Export Contracts and all
Domestic Contracts in U.S. Dollars.

                  SECTION 3.04.  ASSIGNMENT OF EXPORT CONTRACT LETTERS OF
CREDIT PROCEEDS; LENDER AS ADVISING BANK.

                  (a)      The Borrower shall assign to the Lender the proceeds
of each Export Contract Letter of Credit pursuant to an executed assignment of
proceeds complying with the provisions of Sections 9-107 and 5-114 of the UCC
and providing that all payments under such Export Contract Letter of Credit
shall be made directly to Lender's Account and otherwise in form and substance
satisfactory to Lender (a "Assignment of Proceeds"). The Borrower shall cause
each Assignment of Proceeds to be acknowledged by the paying bank.

                  (b)      Each Export Contract Letter of Credit shall be freely
negotiable, and the Borrower shall authorize only the Lender to negotiate such
Export Contract Letter of Credit.

                  SECTION 3.05.  SHIPMENT OF EXPORT CONTRACT ITEMS. Borrower
shall not ship any contract items under any Export Contract to the Account
Debtor thereunder unless and until (a) the Borrower has received the original
Export Contract Letter of Credit relating to such Export Contract, (b) such
Export Contract Letter of Credit is in full force and effect at the time of such
shipment, (c) the proceeds of the Export Contract Letter of Credit relating to
such Export Contract have been assigned to Lender pursuant to Section 3.04
hereof and (d) the paying bank under the Export Contract Letter of Credit has
acknowledged and consented to such assignment.

                  (b)      Whenever Borrower desires to request any Letter of

                  (ii)     Borrower shall pay to Lender a non-refundable
                           commitment fee from the date of this Agreement to the

                           (which commitment fee shall be computed by treating
                           each outstanding Non-Guaranteed Letter of Credit as a
                           usage of the Non-Guaranteed Loan Maximum
                           Availability) at a rate per annum equal to one-eighth
                           of one percent (.125%), which commitment fee shall be
                           payable by Borrower to the Lender quarterly in

                           Exim-Guaranteed Maximum Availability, which guaranty
                           fee shall be used by Lender to pay the comparable
                           facility fee due from Lender to Eximbank under the
                           Eximbank Guarantee;

                  (ii)     on or before the date on which all of the conditions
                           precedent set forth in Section 5.02 hereof have been
                           satisfied, an origination fee for Exim-Guaranteed
                           Loans and Exim-Guaranteed Letters of Credit in an

                           which such rate is made (which commitment fee shall
                           be computed by treating each outstanding
                           Exim-Guaranteed Letter of Credit as a usage of the

                           day of each calendar quarter, commencing with the
                           first day of the first month of January, April, July
                           or October after the date on which all of the

                           satisfied, and continuing to be due on the first
                           (1st) day of each

                           January, April, July and October thereafter so long
                           as this Agreement is in effect as well as on the
                           Maturity Date.

                  (c)      In consideration of the Lender entering into this
Agreement and making the Letters of Credit available, Borrower shall pay to
Lender, on demand, (1) upon the issuance of each Non-Guaranteed Letter of Credit
with an original stated amount of $2,000,000 or greater, a letter of credit fee
equal to one and one-half percent (1.50%) per annum of the original stated
amount of such Non-Guaranteed Letter of Credit, (2) upon the issuance of each
Non-Guaranteed Letter of Credit with an original stated amount of less than
$2,000,000, a letter of credit fee equal to the greater of $1000 or two percent
(2.0%) per annum of the original stated amount of such Non-Guaranteed Letter of
Credit, or (3) upon the issuance of each Exim-Guaranteed Letter of Credit, a
letter of credit fee equal to the greater of $1000 or one and one-half of one
percent (1.50%) per annum of the original stated amount of such Exim-Guaranteed
Letter of Credit, which fees shall be fully earned and non-refundable upon the
issuance of such Letter of Credit. If any of the Existing Letters of Credit is
extended at the request of Borrower after the Closing Date, the Borrower shall
pay to the Lender at the time of such extension a new letter of credit fee in an
amount equal to the fee prescribed in the preceding sentence for such extended
term. The Borrower shall also pay, on demand, in addition to all standard
documentary fees and out-of-pocket expenses related to the handling of the
Letter of Credit, the following rates and fees in connection with any Letter of
Credit:

                  (i)      For each amendment of a Letter of Credit, a fee in
                           the amount of $100 (plus a new issuance fee under the
                           first sentence of this Section if the amount or
                           expiration date of such Letter of Credit is amended
                           or extended); and

                  (ii)     For each draft presented and paid under a Letter of
                           Credit, a fee in an amount equal to the greater of
                           $300 or one-half of one percent (0.50%) of the amount
                           so paid.

                  SECTION 4.03.  INTEREST.

                  (a)      The Borrower agrees to pay interest in respect of all
unpaid principal amounts of the Loans and Reimbursement Obligations at the
following rates per annum (subject to adjustment as set forth in Section 4.03(b)
below):

                  (i)      a variable rate per annum equal to the Adjusted
                           Monthly LIBOR Index Rate (adjusted on the first LIBOR
                           Business Day of each LIBOR Period) plus two percent
                           (2.0%) on the aggregate outstanding principal balance
                           from time to time of all of the Non-Guaranteed Loans
                           and the then due and payable Reimbursement
                           Obligations (other than the Exim-Guaranteed
                           Reimbursement Obligations); and

                  (ii)     a variable rate per annum as agreed to by the parties
                           hereto and Eximbank on the aggregate principal
                           balance of the Exim-

                                      -26-

<PAGE>

                           Guaranteed Loans and the then due and payable Exim-
                           Guaranteed Reimbursement Obligations outstanding from
                           time to time.

                  (b)      If a Loan is paid on the same date it is made, one
day's interest shall be paid thereon by the Borrower. In addition, if Borrower's
Reimbursement Obligation with respect to any drawing under any Letter of Credit
is paid by 2:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) on the date on which such drawing is honored
by the Lender, no interest shall be charged on such Reimbursement Obligation;
otherwise interest therein shall accrue from and after such date.

                  (c)      After the occurrence and during the continuation of
any Event of Default, the principal amount of all of the Obligations (and, to
the extent permitted by applicable law), all accrued interest thereon may, if
elected by Lender in its discretion, bear interest at a rate per annum equal to
as much as two hundred basis points (2.00%) above the interest rate otherwise in
effect pursuant to this Section 4.03, which rate adjustment shall be effective
from and after the tenth (10th) day after the date written notice thereof is
given by the Lender to the Borrower, and at the option of the Lender, the
ability of the Borrower to obtain any further Loans or Letters of Credit may be
suspended.

                  SECTION 4.04.  PAYMENTS, PREPAYMENTS AND COMPUTATIONS.

                  (a)      Except as may be otherwise specifically provided
herein, all payments by the Borrower with respect to the Loans, the
Reimbursement Obligations or any other Obligations under this Agreement or any
of the other Credit Documents shall be made without defense, set-off or
counterclaim to the Lender not later than 2:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) on the date
when due and shall be made in lawful money of the United States of America in
immediately available funds. Any payment received by Lender before 2:00 p.m. on
a Business Day shall be credited to the Obligations in the manner set forth in
this Agreement on such Business Day. Any payment received by Lender on a
non-Business Day or after 2:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) on any Business Day shall be
deemed received by Lender at the opening of its business on the next Business
Day and shall be credited to the Obligations in the manner set forth in this
Agreement on such next Business Day. Whenever any payment to be made hereunder
or under the Note or any of the other Credit Documents shall be stated to be due
on a day which is not a Business Day, the due date thereof shall be extended to
the next succeeding Business Day and, with respect to payments of principal,
interest thereon shall be payable at the applicable rate during such extension.
All computation of interest or fees due hereunder or under any of the other
Credit Documents shall be made on the basis of a year of 360 days and the actual
number of days elapsed.

                  (b)      Any voluntary prepayment made on the Loans shall be
applied, first, to interest accrued thereon through the date thereof and then
principal in the manner set forth in Section 4.04(c) below.

                  (c)      All payments or prepayments of principal, interest or
otherwise received by Lender prior to any payment default under the Note or with
respect to any Obligations relating to a Letter of Credit shall be applied,
first, to the Exim-Guaranteed Obligations, and, second, to the Non-Guaranteed
Obligations; provided, however, that any

                                      -27-

<PAGE>

payment received by Lender from Borrower subsequent to any payment default under
the Note or with respect to any Obligations relating to a Letter of Credit shall
be applied pro-rata to all of the Obligations (or to a trust or collateral
account described in Section 9.02 hereof with respect to any Letters of Credit
then outstanding), based upon the total amount of such Obligations outstanding
and the total stated amount of any Letters of Credit outstanding as of the date
of the payment default.

                  (d)      Borrower may voluntarily prepay the Loans, in whole
or in part (which prepayment shall be applied in accordance with Section
4.04(b)(iv) above), at any time without premium or penalty.

                  SECTION 4.05.  COLLATERAL AND GUARANTIES. The Obligations
shall be secured pursuant to the Security Documents. The repayment of ninety
percent (90%) of the Exim-Guaranteed Obligations shall be guaranteed pursuant to
the terms of the Eximbank Guarantee. The Borrower also shall execute or deliver
(or cause to be executed and delivered) any and all financing statements,
financing statement amendments, notice filings and such other documents as the
Lender may reasonably request from time to time in order to perfect or maintain
the perfection of the Lender's Liens under such Security Documents. The
Obligations shall be fully guaranteed by each Guarantor pursuant to the Parent
Guaranty and the Subsidiary Guaranty.

                  SECTION 4.06.  LOAN ACCOUNT. The Lender shall open and
maintain on its books one or more loan accounts in the name of the Borrower, and
such loan account or accounts shall show as debits thereto the Lender's Loans
made to the Borrower under this Agreement and as credits thereto all payments
received by the Lender and applied thereto so that the balance of the loan
account or accounts of the Borrower with the Lender at all times shall reflect
the principal amount of the Loans then outstanding from the Lender to the
Borrower. The entries made in the aforesaid loan account or accounts shall be
prima facie evidence, in the absence of manifest error, of the existence and
amounts of the Obligations of the Borrower therein recorded and any payments
thereon. The Lender will account to the Borrower from time to time with periodic
statements of borrowings, charges and payments made pursuant to this Agreement
and the other Credit Documents, and each such account rendered by the Lender
shall be deemed final, binding and conclusive unless the Lender is notified by
the Borrower in writing within thirty (30) days after the date such account is
so rendered that the Borrower disputes any item thereof (but any such notice by
the Borrower shall be deemed an objection only to those items specifically set
forth in such notice). Failure by the Lender to render any such account shall in
no way affect Lender's rights hereunder or under any of the other Credit
Documents.

                  SECTION 4.07.  CAPITAL ADEQUACY. Without limiting any other
provisions of this Agreement, in the event that the Lender determines after the
date hereof that the introduction or change after the date of this Agreement of
any law, treaty, governmental (or quasi-governmental) rule, regulation,
guideline or order regarding capital adequacy, or any change therein or in the
interpretation or application thereof after the date of this Agreement, or
compliance by the Lender with any request or directive regarding capital
adequacy (whether or not having the force of law and whether or not failure to
comply therewith would be unlawful) from a central bank or governmental
authority or body having jurisdiction which is introduced or changed after the
date of this

                                      -28-

<PAGE>

Agreement, does or shall have the effect of reducing the rate of return on the
Lender's capital as a consequence of its obligations hereunder or under a Letter
of Credit to a level below that which the Lender could have achieved but for
such law, treaty, rule, regulation, guideline or order or such change or
compliance (taking into consideration the Lender's policies with respect to
capital adequacy and assuming the full utilization of the Lender's capital
immediately before such adoption, change or compliance) by an amount reasonably
deemed by the Lender to be material, then the Lender shall promptly after its
determination of such occurrence notify the Borrower thereof. The Borrower
agrees to pay to the Lender as an additional fee from time to time, within ten
(10) days after written notice and demand by the Lender, such amount as the
Lender certifies to be the amount that will compensate it for such reduction in
connection with its obligations hereunder or under a Letter of Credit. A
certificate of the Lender claiming compensation under this Section 4.07 shall be
conclusive in the absence of manifest error or fraud and shall set forth the
nature of the occurrence giving rise to such compensation, the additional amount
or amounts to be paid to it hereunder and the method by which such amounts were
determined. In determining such amount, the Lender may use reasonable averaging
and attribution methods.

                  SECTION 4.08.  AGREEMENTS REGARDING INTEREST AND OTHER
CHARGES. Borrower and the Lender hereby agree that the only charges imposed or
to be imposed by the Lender upon Borrower for the use of money in connection
with the Loans or Letters of Credit is and will be the interest required to be
paid under the provisions of this Agreement as well as the related provisions of
the Note. In no event shall the amount of interest due and payable under this
Agreement, the Note or any of the other Credit Documents exceed the maximum rate
of interest allowed by applicable law and, in the event any such payment is made
by the Borrower or any other Credit Party or received by the Lender, such excess
sum shall be credited as a payment of principal. It is the express intent hereof
that the Borrower not pay and the Lender not receive, directly or indirectly or
in any manner, interest in excess of that which may be lawfully paid under
applicable law. All interest and other charges, fees or other amounts deemed to
be interest which are paid or agreed to be paid to the Lender under this
Agreement, the Note or any of the other Credit Document shall, to the maximum
extent permitted by applicable law, be amortized, allocated and spread on a pro
rata basis throughout the entire actual term of the Loans (including any
extension or renewal period). Any and all fees payable hereunder are not
intended, and shall not be deemed, to be interest or a charge for the use of
money, but rather shall constitute an "other charge" within the meaning of
O.C.G.A. Section 7-4-2(a)(1).

                  SECTION 4.09.  OBLIGATIONS ABSOLUTE; LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
WITH RESPECT TO LETTERS OF CREDIT. The Borrower's Obligations under this
Agreement (including without limitation its Obligations hereunder to reimburse
the Lender for the amount of any draft drawn under any Letter of Credit) are
primary, absolute, independent, irrevocable, continuing and unconditional, and
such obligations shall be performed by the Borrower strictly in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement under all circumstances whatsoever. As between the
Borrower and the Lender, the Borrower assumes all risks of the acts and
omissions of, or misuse of any Letter of Credit by the beneficiaries of such
Letter of Credit. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement shall not be impaired, affected
or released by: (i) the voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution,
merger, consolidation, sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of
the assets of the Borrower or any marshalling

                                      -29-

<PAGE>

of assets and liabilities, receivership, insolvency, bankruptcy, assignment for
the benefit of creditors, reorganization, moratorium, arrangement or similar
proceeding affecting the Borrower; (ii) any lack of validity or enforceability
of the transactions contemplated by or related to any Letter of Credit; (iii)
any amendment or waiver of or consent to depart from all or any of the terms of
the transactions contemplated by any Letter of Credit; (iv) the existence of any
claim, set-off, defense or other right which the Borrower may have at any time
against the Lender, the beneficiary or other user of any Letter of Credit, or
any other person or entity, whether in connection with this Agreement, the
transactions contemplated herein, the transactions contemplated by any Letter of
Credit, or any unrelated transaction; or (v) the fact that any draft, affidavit,
certificate, letter, invoice or other document presented under any Letter of
Credit proves to have been forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any
respect or any statement therein proves to have been untrue or inaccurate in any
respect. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this Section 4.09
is intended to relieve the Lender of any of its obligations under this Agreement
or the other Credit Documents or under applicable law, including the Uniform
Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits, 1993 Revision, ICC Publication No.
500.

         or hold separate all or any material portion of its businesses or
         assets, which has had or reasonably could be expected to have a
         Material Adverse Effect;

                  (f)      the Loan to be made or the Letter of Credit to be
         issued and the use of proceeds thereof shall not contravene, violate or
         conflict with, or involve Borrower or the Lender in a violation of, any
         law, rule, injunction, or regulation, or determination of any court of
         law or other governmental authority; and

                  (g)      In the case of any Exim-Guaranteed Loan or
         Exim-Guaranteed Letter of Credit, all applicable conditions precedent

         or issuing such Letter of Credit.

                  Each request by Borrower for a Loan and each request by
Borrower for the issuance of a Letter of Credit shall constitute a
representation and warranty by the Borrower to the Lender, as of the date of
such Loan or the date of the issuance of such Letter of Credit (as the case may
be), that all of the applicable conditions specified in this Article have been
satisfied.

                                   ARTICLE VI.

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

                  Borrower hereby represents and warrants to the Lender as
follows:

                  SECTION 6.01.  ORGANIZATION; SUBSIDIARIES; AUTHORIZATION;
VALID AND BINDING OBLIGATIONS. The Borrower is a corporation duly organized and
validly existing in good standing under the laws of South Dakota. The Borrower
is duly qualified as a foreign corporation in good standing in the State of
Georgia and each other jurisdiction where the ownership of property or the
nature of the business transacted by it makes such qualification necessary,
except where the failure

                                      -33-

<PAGE>

to be so qualified would not have a Material Adverse Effect. The Borrower has
all requisite power and authority to execute and deliver the Credit Documents to
which it is a party, to perform its obligations under such Credit Documents and
to own its property and carry on its business. The Credit Documents have been
duly authorized by all requisite corporate action on the part of the Borrower
and duly executed and delivered by authorized officers of the Borrower. Each of
the Credit Documents to which the Borrower is a party constitutes a valid
obligation of the Borrower, legally binding upon and enforceable against the
Borrower in accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be
limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or
similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally or by
general principles of equity.

                  SECTION 6.02.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. All of the financial
statements for Borrower and its Subsidiaries provided to the Lender fairly
present the financial condition of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries as at the
dates thereof and the results of their operations for the periods covered
thereby in conformity with GAAP (subject, in the case of interim financial
statements, to normal year-end adjustments), except that in no event shall the
assets, liabilities, financial results or business operations of M-Tron,
Spinnaker or their respective subsidiaries be considered in connection with the
preparation of such financial statements for the Borrower. Since the date of the
most recent annual financial statements for Borrower and its Subsidiaries
presented to the Lender, there has been no Material Adverse Effect.

                  SECTION 6.03.  ACTIONS PENDING. There is no action, suit,
investigation or proceeding pending or, to the knowledge of the Borrower,
threatened against any Credit Party or any properties or rights of any Credit
Party, by or before any court, arbitrator or administrative or governmental body
which has had or could reasonably be expected to result in any Material Adverse
Effect.

                  SECTION 6.04.  TITLE TO PROPERTIES. Borrower and its
Subsidiaries have good and marketable title to all of its respective properties
and assets (other than properties and assets disposed of in the ordinary course
of business), subject to no Lien of any kind except Liens granted under the
Security Documents or Permitted Liens. As of the date hereof, Borrower or and
its Subsidiaries own no real property other than the real property covered by
the Security Deed.

                  SECTION 6.05.  TAXES. Borrower has filed all federal, state
and other income tax returns which, to the knowledge of the Borrower, are
required to be filed, and each has paid all taxes as shown on such returns and

except such taxes as are not due or which are being contested in good faith by
appropriate proceedings for which adequate reserves have been established in
accordance with GAAP as required below.

                  SECTION 6.06.  CONFLICTING AGREEMENTS AND OTHER MATTERS.
Neither the execution nor delivery of this Agreement, nor fulfillment of or
compliance with the terms and provisions of this Agreement, will conflict with,
or result in a breach of the terms, conditions or provisions of, or constitute a
default under, or result in any violation of, or result in the creation of any
Lien (other than any Lien arising under any Credit Document) upon any of the
properties or

                                      -34-

<PAGE>

assets of any Credit Party pursuant to the charter or by-laws of such Credit
Party, any award of any arbitrator or any agreement, instrument, order,
judgment, decree, statute, law, rule or regulation to which any Credit Party or
any of its property is subject.

                  SECTION 6.07.  ERISA. Except as may have been expressly
disclosed in writing by Borrower to the Lender, no accumulated funding
deficiency (as defined in Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code),
whether or not waived, exists with respect to Borrower's Plans (other than a
Multiemployer Plan), no liability to the PBGC has been or is expected to be
incurred by Borrower with respect to any Plan (other than a Multiemployer Plan)
which has or could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, and
Borrower has not incurred any withdrawal liability under Title IV of ERISA with
respect to any Multiemployer Plan which has or could reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect. The execution and delivery of the Credit
Documents will not involve any transaction which is subject to any prohibitions
of Section 406 of ERISA or in connection with which a tax could be imposed
pursuant to Section 4975 of the Code.

                  SECTION 6.08.  GOVERNMENTAL AND THIRD PARTY CONSENTS. Except
for any recording or filing which may be required by applicable law to perfect
or maintain the perfection of the Lender's Liens in the Collateral, and except
for the execution and delivery of the Eximbank Guarantee and the Eximbank Loan
Authorization Agreement, no consent, approval or authorization of, or
declaration or filing with, any governmental authority or third party is
required for the valid execution, delivery and performance by any Credit Party
of the Credit Documents executed by such Person or the consummation of any of
the transactions contemplated by the Credit Documents.

                  SECTION 6.09.  COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND REGULATIONS. Borrower
is in compliance with all federal, state, local, and other laws, ordinances and
other governmental rules or regulations to which it is subject, including
without limitation, Environmental Laws and laws and regulations relating to
equal employment opportunity and employee safety, and Borrower will promptly
comply with all such laws and regulations which may be legally imposed on
Borrower in the future, except where the failure to so comply has not had or
could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

                  SECTION 6.10.  POSSESSION OF LICENSES, LEASES, FRANCHISES,
ETC.. Borrower possesses any and all licenses, leases, franchises, certificates,
permits and other authorizations from any governmental or regulatory authorities
or from any other Person that are necessary in any material respect for the

and Borrower is not is in violation of any thereof in any material respect.

                  SECTION 6.11.  ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE. Borrower has obtained
all material permits, licenses and other authorizations which are required under
Environmental Laws, and Borrower is in compliance in all material respects with
all terms and conditions of such permits, licenses and authorizations and are
also in compliance in all material respects with all other limitations,
restrictions, conditions, standards, prohibitions, requirements, obligations,
schedules and timetables contained in any applicable Environmental Laws.
Borrower is not aware of, or has received notice of, any past, present or future
events, conditions, circumstances, activities, practices, incidents, actions or
plans which, with respect to Borrower, may interfere with or prevent

                                      -35-

<PAGE>

compliance or continued compliance in all material respects with Environmental
Laws, or may give rise to any material common law or legal liability, or
otherwise form the basis of any material claim, action, demand, suit,
proceeding, hearing, study or investigation, based on or related to the
manufacture, processing, distribution, use, treatment, storage, disposal,
transport or handling, or the emission, discharge, release or, threatened
release into the environment, of any pollutant, contaminant, chemical, or
industrial, toxic or hazardous substance or waste. There is no civil, criminal
or administrative action, suit, demand, claim, hearing, notice or demand
proceeding pending or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened against
Borrower relating in any way to Environmental Laws.

                  SECTION 6.12.  MARGIN REGULATIONS AND INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT,
ETC.. No part of the proceeds of any of the Loans or the Letters of Credit will
be used for any purpose which violates, or which would be inconsistent or not in
compliance with, the provisions of the applicable Margin Regulations. Borrower
is not an "investment company" or a company "controlled" by an "investment
company" (as each of the quoted terms is defined or used in the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended). Borrower is not subject to regulation under
the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, the Federal Power Act, or any
foreign, federal or local statute or regulation limiting its ability to incur
Indebtedness for money borrowed, to guarantee such Indebtedness or to grant

Agreement or by any other Credit Document.

                  SECTION 6.13.  LABOR MATTERS. Except as may have been
expressly disclosed in writing to Lender by Borrower, Borrower has not
experienced any strike, labor dispute, slow down or work stoppage due to labor
disagreements, and, to the knowledge of the Borrower, there is no strike,
dispute, slow down or work stoppage threatened against Borrower. There are no
claims or lawsuits which have been asserted or instituted against Borrower on
the basis that it did not perform in respect of any undertakings made towards
its employees or their representatives and no basis for such claim or lawsuits
exists. Borrower has acted in all material respects in accordance with any
agreements entered into with representatives of its employees relating to their
relations with and obligations towards their employees.

                  SECTION 6.14.  DISCLOSURE. Neither this Agreement nor any
other document, certificate or statement furnished to the Lender by or on behalf
of any Credit Party in connection herewith contains any untrue statement of a
material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the
statements contained herein and therein not materially misleading. There is no
fact peculiar to any Credit Party which could reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect and which has not been set forth in this Agreement or in
the other documents, certificates and statements furnished to the Lender by or
on behalf any Credit Party prior to the date hereof in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby.

                  SECTION 6.15.  INSURANCE. Borrower maintains insurance with
respect to its properties and businesses, with financially sound and reputable
insurers, having coverages against losses or damages of the kinds customarily
insured against by reputable companies engaged in the same or similar
businesses, such insurance being in amounts no less than those amounts which are
customary for such companies under similar circumstances. Borrower has paid all
insurance

                                      -36-

<PAGE>

such policies and coverages, are in full force and effect.

                  SECTION 6.16.  REAFFIRMATION. Each request by Borrower for the
advance of a Loan or the issuance of a Letter of Credit shall constitute (i) an
automatic representation and warranty by Borrower to Lender that there does not
exist any Default or Event of Default as of the date of such request as well as
after giving effect to the advance of such Loan or the issuance of such Letter
of Credit (as the case may be) and (ii) a reaffirmation as of the date of said
request as well as after giving effect to such Loan advance or such Letter of
Credit issuance of all of the representations and warranties of the Credit

herein.

                                  ARTICLE VII.

                  (xiii)   a Reportable Event shall occur which the Lender
         determines in good faith would reasonably be expected to result in
         liability to the Borrower and its Subsidiaries in an aggregate amount
         exceeding $250,000 or which the Lender determines in good faith
         constitutes grounds for the termination by the PBGC of any Plan or for

         after all of the conditions set forth in Section 5.02 hereof have been
         satisfied, Eximbank shall terminate or revoke (or attempt to terminate
         or revoke) the Eximbank Guarantee or the Eximbank Guarantee shall no
         longer be in effect for any other reason.

         remaining commitments the Lender may have hereunder to make any further
         Loans to Borrower or issue any further Letters of Credit for the
         account of Borrower, whereupon any such commitment shall terminate
         immediately and any remaining accrued but unpaid commitment fees shall

         other notice or demand of any kind; and

                  (ii)     by written notice to the Borrower, declare any or all
         of the unpaid principal of and any accrued interest on the Note and any
         or all other Obligations, to be, and whereupon the same shall become,
         immediately due and payable, and the same shall thereupon become due
         and payable without further demand, presentment, protest or notice of
         any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by the Borrower; and

                  (iii)    by written notice to Borrower, require that Borrower
         immediately pay to the Lender an amount of immediately available funds
         equal to the aggregate maximum aggregate amount then available for
         drawing under any or all Letters of Credit which may be outstanding at
         such time (and Borrower shall be deemed to have requested that Lender
         make, and Lender in its discretion may make, Loans in an amount
         sufficient to make such payment on Borrower's behalf, and any such Loan
         made by the Lender with respect to any particular outstanding Letter of
         Credit shall be deemed to be a Non-Guaranteed Loan if such Letter of
         Credit is a Non-Guaranteed Letter of Credit, and an Exim-Guaranteed

         and the funds so paid by or on behalf of Borrower shall be deposited by
         the Lender in a trust or collateral account with Lender for which the
         Lender shall have the sole power of access, investment and withdrawal,
         and such funds shall be applied by the Lender at such times and from
         time to time to satisfy the Borrower's reimbursement obligations with
         respect to such Letters of Credit and the Borrower hereby pledges,
         assigns and grants to the Lender a first-priority security interest in
         and Lien on such account and any and all funds therein and the proceeds
         thereof as collateral for the Obligations (and upon the termination of
         this Agreement, the expiration or release of all Letters of Credit, and
         the payment in full of all Obligations, any remaining surplus of such
         funds shall be paid by the Lender to the Borrower, but the Lender shall
         have no obligation or responsibility to invest any such funds or to pay
         interest thereon

         loss resulting from any investment of such funds by the Lender in its
         discretion); and

                  (iv)     exercise all or any of its rights and remedies as it
         may otherwise have under any of the other Credit Documents or any
         applicable law;

provided, however, that upon the occurrence of an Event of Default specified in
Section 9.01(ii) or Section 9.01(iii) above, the result which would occur upon
the giving of notice pursuant to Section 9.02(i), (ii) and (iii) shall occur
automatically without the giving of any such notice; and provided, further, that
upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, Eximbank shall have the right to (x)
direct that the Lender declare the principal of and accrued interest on the
Exim-Guaranteed Obligations to be immediately due and payable and (y) request
that the Lender accelerate the maturities of any of Borrower's other Obligations
to the full extent of the Lender's right thereunder.

                  (b)      No failure or delay on the part of the Lender to
         exercise any right or remedy hereunder or under the Credit Documents
         shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial
         exercise of any right or remedy hereunder preclude any further exercise
         thereof or the exercise of any further right or remedy hereunder or
         under the Credit Documents. No exercise by the Lender of any remedy
         under the other Credit Documents shall operate as a limitation on any
         rights or remedies of the Lender under this Agreement, except to the
         extent of moneys actually received by the Lender under the other Credit
         Documents.

receipt requested, addressed as aforesaid, (iii) if sent for overnight delivery

                  SECTION 10.02. NO WAIVER; REMEDIES CUMULATIVE. No failure or
delay on the part of the Lender in exercising any right or remedy hereunder and
no course of dealing between Borrower and the Lender shall operate as a waiver
thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right or remedy
hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any
other right or remedy hereunder. The rights and remedies herein expressly
provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies which the
Lender would otherwise have. No notice to or demand on Borrower not required
hereunder or under any other Credit Document in any case shall entitle Borrower
to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances or
constitute a waiver of the rights of the Lender to any other or further action
in any circumstances without notice or demand.

                  SECTION 10.03. PAYMENT OF EXPENSES; INDEMNITY.

                  (a)      Borrower agrees to: (i) pay all reasonable
         out-of-pocket costs and expenses of the Lender incurred in connection
         with its negotiation, structuring, documenting, closing, administration
         or modification of, or in connection with the preservation of Lender's
         rights under, enforcement of, or any refinancing, renegotiation,
         restructuring or termination of, this Agreement or any other Credit
         Document or any instruments referred to therein or any amendment,
         waiver or consent relating thereto, including, without limitation, the
         reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel for the Lender actually
         incurred, and (ii) pay and hold the Lender harmless from and against
         any and all present and future stamp, documentary, property, ad valorem
         or other similar non-income taxes with respect to this Agreement, the
         Note or any other Credit Documents, any Collateral described therein,
         or any payments due thereunder, and save the Lender harmless from and
         against any and all liabilities with respect to or resulting from any
         delay or omission to pay such taxes.

                  (b)      In addition to the other amounts payable by the
         Borrower under this Agreement (including, without limitation,
         subsection (a) above), the Borrower hereby agrees to pay and indemnify
         the Lender from and against all claims, liabilities, losses, costs and
         expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and
         expenses) which the Lender may (other than as a result of the gross
         negligence or willful misconduct of such Person) incur or be subjected
         to as a consequence, directly or indirectly, of (i) any actual or
         proposed use of any of the Loans or Letters of Credit or Borrower's
         entering into or performing under any Credit Document, (ii) any breach
         by Borrower of any representation, warranty, covenant or condition in,
         or the occurrence of any other default under, this Agreement or any of
         the other Credit Documents, including without limitation all reasonable
         attorney's fees or expenses resulting from the settlement or defense of
         any claims or liabilities arising as a result of any such breach or
         default, (iii) allegations of participation or interference by the
         Lender in the management, contractual relations or other affairs of
         Borrower, (iv) the Lender's holding any Lien on or administering any of
         the Collateral, (v) allegations that the Lender has joint liability
         with Borrower to any third party for any reason, or (vi) any suit,
         investigation or proceeding as to which the Lender is involved as a
         consequence, directly or indirectly, of its execution of this Agreement
         or any of the other Credit Documents, the making of any Loan, the
         issuance of any Letter of Credit, the holding of any Lien on any of the
         Collateral or any other event or transaction contemplated by this
         Agreement or any of the Credit Documents.

                  SECTION 10.04. FURTHER ASSURANCES. Upon notice from the
Lender, Borrower will, at any and all times, execute and deliver all such
further documents, assignments, recordings, filings, transfers and assurances as
may be reasonably necessary for the better assuring and confirming of all of the
rights, revenues and other funds pledged or assigned to or mortgaged for the
payment of its obligations hereunder, or intended so to be. If Borrower fails to
do so after demand by Lender, Borrower hereby authorizes and empowers the Lender
to file any financing statement or any amendments thereto with respect to any of
the Collateral and the Lender's Liens therein or in accordance with the Uniform
Commercial Code as in effect in the State of Georgia or any other applicable
jurisdiction without the signature of Borrower.

                  SECTION 10.05. SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS; SALE OF INTEREST. This
Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of and be enforceable
by the respective successors and permitted assigns of the parties hereto;
provided that Borrower may not assign or transfer any of its rights or
obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the Lender. Lender
may sell, assign or grant participations in all or any part of Lender's rights,
titles or interests hereunder and under the other Credit Documents without the
prior written consent of the Borrower (hereinafter, a "Sale of Interest"), which
Sale of Interest shall be at Borrower's expense if such Sale of Interest is made
to Eximbank or if such Sale of Interest occurs after the occurrence of an Event
of Default. A Sale of Interest shall be at Lender's expense at all other times.

                  SECTION 10.06. AMENDMENTS. No amendment or waiver of any
provision of this Agreement or the other Credit Documents, nor consent to any
departure by any party hereto, or any other Credit Party therefrom, shall in any
event be enforceable against any party to this Agreement unless the same shall
be in writing and signed by such party, and then such waiver or consent shall be
effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which
given.

                  SECTION 10.07. TIME OF ESSENCE. Time is of the essence of this
Agreement and each of the other Credit Documents.

                  SECTION 10.08. GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement is intended to be
performed in the State of Georgia, and shall be construed and enforced in
accordance with, and the rights of the parties shall be governed by, the laws of
the State of Georgia without regard to principles of conflicts of laws thereof.

                  SECTION 10.09. COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in
any number of counterparts and by the different parties hereto on separate
counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be an original,
but all of which shall together constitute one and the same instrument.

                  SECTION 10.10. EFFECTIVENESS; SURVIVAL

                  (a)      This Agreement shall become effective on the date on
         which all of the parties hereto shall have signed a copy hereof
         (whether the same or different copies) and the Lender shall have
         received the same.

                  (b)      All representations and warranties made herein, in
         the certificates, reports, notices, and other documents delivered
         pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the execution and delivery of
         this Agreement, the other Credit Documents, and such other agreements
         and documents, the making of the Loans hereunder, the issuance of the
         Letters of Credit and the execution and delivery of the Note.

                  SECTION 10.11. SEVERABILITY. In case any provision in or
Obligation under this Agreement or the other Credit Documents shall be invalid,
illegal or unenforceable, in whole or in part, in any jurisdiction, the
validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions or
obligations, or of such provision or obligation in any other jurisdiction, shall
not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.

                  SECTION 10.12. INDEPENDENCE OF COVENANTS. All covenants
hereunder shall be given independent effect so that if a particular action or
condition is not permitted by any of such covenants, the fact that it would be
permitted by an exception to, or be otherwise within the limitation of, another
covenant, shall not avoid the occurrence of a Default or an Event of Default if
such action is taken or condition exists.

                  SECTION 10.13. HEADINGS DESCRIPTIVE. The headings of the
several sections and subsections of this Agreement are inserted for convenience
only and shall not in any way affect the meaning or construction of any
provision of this Agreement.

                  SECTION 10.14. TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT. At such time as (i)
Lender is no longer obligated under this Agreement (whether by the terms hereof
or as a result of a release of such obligations by the Borrower) to make any
further Loans or issue any Letters of Credit, (ii) no Letters of Credit are
outstanding, or if any Letters of Credit are outstanding, the Borrower shall
have delivered cash or cash equivalents acceptable to Lender in an amount equal
to 102% of the maximum amount then available to be drawn under each applicable
Letter of Credit outstanding, which funds are to be deposited in a separate,
blocked account (the "Cash Collateral Account") maintained by Borrower with the
Lender and are to be held in the Cash Collateral Account for the benefit of the
Lender as cash collateral for the Borrower's Reimbursement Obligations with
respect to such outstanding Letters of Credit, and the Borrower shall have
executed such additional documentation to evidence such cash collateral
arrangement as Lender shall reasonably request, and (iii) all Obligations have
been paid and satisfied in full, this Agreement shall terminate; provided,
however, that any and all indemnity obligations of Borrower to the Lender
arising hereunder or under any of the other Credit Documents shall survive the
termination of this Agreement. Upon the termination of this Agreement as set
forth in this Section 10.14, the Lender shall deliver to Borrower termination
statements and other documents necessary or appropriate to evidence the
termination of the Lender's liens in the Collateral.

                  SECTION 10.15. ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This Agreement and the other
Credit Documents constitute the entire agreement between the Borrower and the
Lender with respect to the Loans, the other Obligations and the Collateral and
supersede all other prior agreements, representations and understandings related
to such subject matters, including without limitation the

                                      -52-

<PAGE>

Original Credit Agreement, but excluding each Application and Agreement for
Irrevocable Standby Letter of Credit previously executed with respect to each
Existing Letter of Credit. If the Borrower desires to terminate this Agreement
before all of the conditions specified in Section 5.01 hereof have been
satisfied, all funds pledged by Borrower to Lender as cash collateral for the
Existing Letters of Credit shall continue to be retained by the Lender as cash
collateral for the Borrower's Reimbursement Obligations with respect to the
Existing Letters of Credit, and the Borrower shall execute such additional
documentation to evidence such cash collateral arrangement as Lender shall
reasonably request.

                  SECTION 10.16. RESERVED.

                  SECTION 10.17. M-TRON AND SPINNAKER. At no time shall (x) the
value of capital stock of M-Tron or Spinnaker held by Borrower, if any, or (y)
the assets, liabilities, financial results or business operations of M-Tron,
Spinnaker or their respective subsidiaries be considered in connection with
compliance with any conditions to borrowing, representations and warranties,
covenants or default provisions of the Borrower under the Credit Documents.

                  SECTION 10.18. JURY TRIAL WAIVER; CONSENT TO FORUM.

                  (a)      THE BORROWER AND THE LENDER IRREVOCABLY WAIVE ALL
RIGHT OF TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF
OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE OTHER CREDIT DOCUMENTS OR ANY
MATTER ARISING HEREUNDER OR THEREUNDER TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW.

                  (b)      THE BORROWER AND THE LENDER ALSO AGREE THAT ANY LEGAL
ACTION OR PROCEEDING WITH RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE OTHER CREDIT
DOCUMENTS OR TO ENFORCE ANY JUDGMENT OBTAINED AGAINST THE BORROWER IN CONNECTION
WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR SUCH OTHER CREDIT DOCUMENT, MAY BE BROUGHT BY THE LENDER
OR BORROWER IN ANY STATE OR FEDERAL COURT SITTING IN THE COUNTY OF THE STATE IN

JURISDICTION OF WHICH SUCH BORROWER OR ANY OF ITS PROPERTY IS OR MAY BE SUBJECT.
EACH OF THE BORROWER AND THE LENDER IRREVOCABLY SUBMITS TO THE JURISDICTION OF
THE AFORESAID STATE AND FEDERAL COURTS, AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY PRESENT OR
FUTURE OBJECTION TO VENUE IN ANY SUCH COURT, AND ANY PRESENT OR FUTURE CLAIM
THAT ANY SUCH COURT IS AN INCONVENIENT FORUM, IN CONNECTION WITH ANY ACTION OR
PROCEEDING RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE OTHER CREDIT DOCUMENTS.
