1992 STOCK OPTION PLAN</FONT>

<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this
1992 Stock Option Plan (the &#147;Plan&#148;) is to aid Bowne &#038;
Co., Inc. (the &#147;Company&#148;) and its subsidiaries in attracting and retaining capable
officers and key employees and to provide an inducement to such personnel to
promote the best interests of the Company by enabling and encouraging them to
acquire stock ownership in the Company.</FONT>

<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;TYPES OF
OPTIONS AND AMOUNT OF STOCK: Except as otherwise permitted pursuant
to paragraph&nbsp;9 hereof, the total number of shares of the
Company&#146;s Common Stock
that may be issued under the Plan shall not exceed 850,000. The options granted
under the Plan may be Incentive Stock Options (&#147;Incentive Stock
Options&#148;) as
provided for in Section&nbsp;422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the &#147;Code&#148;), or options which are not described in Section&nbsp;422 of the Code
(&#147;Non-Qualified Stock Options&#148;).</FONT>

<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;SOURCE OF STOCK: The shares issued under the Plan may be authorized and
unissued shares or issued and reacquired shares, as the Board of Directors of
the Company (the &#147;Board&#148;) may from time to time determine. The number of shares
of the Company&#146;s Common Stock available for the grant of options under the Plan
shall be decreased by the sum of the number of shares with respect to which
options have been granted and have not been exercised and the number of shares
issued upon exercise of options and shall be increased by the number of shares
that are the subject of options that have expired or terminated prior to
exercise.</FONT>

<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.&nbsp;EFFECTIVE DATE AND TERM OF PLAN: The Plan shall become effective when
adopted by the Board; provided, however, that, unless the Plan as here set
forth is approved at a meeting of the stockholders of the Company by the holders
of a majority of the votes entitled to vote thereon within one year after its
adoption by the Board, the Plan shall not be effective.* Any options
granted under the Plan before such approval shall be conditioned
thereon and, if such
majority vote is not obtained during such one-year period, such
options shall be null and void retroactive to the conditional grant.
Options may be granted
under the Plan on or before the tenth anniversary of the effective date of the
Plan.</FONT>

<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.&nbsp;ADMINISTRATION: The Plan shall be administered by a committee (the
&#147;Committee&#148;) consisting of not less than two non-employee directors of the
Company, all of whom must be disinterested persons as such term is used in
Rule&nbsp;16b-3(c)&nbsp;(2)(i) of the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, to
be appointed by, and to serve at the pleasure of, the Board. The Board may from
time to time appoint members of the Board in substitution for or in addition to
members previously appointed and may fill vacancies on the Committee. The
Committee shall have full power to interpret the Plan and to establish and
amend rules and regulations for its administration.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.&nbsp;SELECTION: From time to time the Committee shall determine those officers
and key employees of the Company or its subsidiaries who shall be granted
options under the Plan (the &#147;Optionees&#148;) and the number of shares subject to
each option.</FONT>

<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.&nbsp;TERMS OF
OPTIONS: (a)&nbsp;Option Period: Each option granted under the Plan
(the &#147;Option&#148;) shall be exercisable during a term ending on the day (the
&#147;Termination Date&#148;) designated by the
</FONT>

preceding the tenth anniversary of the date when granted.
</FONT>


<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;Option Price: The purchase price per share of Common Stock under any Option
granted pursuant to the Plan (the &#145;Option Price&#146;) shall be determined by the
Committee at the time the Option is granted; provided that in no event shall
the Option Price on the date the Option is granted (i)&nbsp;be less
than the Fair
Market Value of the Common Stock of the Company or (ii)&nbsp;be less
than the par
value of a share of Common Stock of the Company. The &#145;Fair
Market Value&#146; shall
be deemed, for all purposes under the Plan, to be the mean between the highest
and lowest sales prices reported as having occurred on the American Stock
Exchange on the date of determination thereof (or, if the Common Stock
of the Company is not then traded on the American Stock Exchange, the
mean between the highest and lowest sales prices reported as having
occurred on the principal market (as determined by the Committee) on
which such stock is then traded) or, if there is no such sale on that
date, then on the last preceding date on which such a sale was
reported; provided, however, that, if the Common Stock of the
Company  has not been traded for ten trading days or if there ceases
to be a principal market for the Common Stock of the Company, the
&#145;Fair Market Value&#146; of such Common Stock shall be determined by the
Committee in its reasonable discretion. The Option Price shall be
paid in full upon the exercise of the Option by certified or bank
cashier&#146;s check payable to the order of the Company or, if acceptable
to the Committee, (A)(1)&nbsp;by the surrender or delivery to the Company
of shares of its Common Stock with a Fair Market Value equal to or
less than the Option Price or (2)&nbsp;through the written election of the
Optionee to have shares of such Common Stock withheld by the Company
from the shares otherwise to be received, with such withheld shares
having an aggregate Fair Market Value on the date of exercise equal
to or less than the Option Price, plus (B)&nbsp;a certified or bank
cashier&#146;s check payable to the Company for any difference, and the
stock purchased shall thereupon be promptly delivered. The Committee
shall determine acceptable methods for tendering and withholding
Common Stock of the Company as payment upon exercise of an Option and
may impose such limitations and prohibitions on the use of Common
Stock of the Company to exercise an Option as it deems appropriate,
including, without limitation, any limitation or prohibition designed
to avoid certain accounting consequences which may result from the
use of Common Stock of the Company as payment upon exercise of an
Option. No Optionee or his legal representatives, legatees or
distributees, as the case may be, will be deemed to be a holder of
any shares pursuant to exercise of an Option until the date of the
issuance of a stock certificate to him for such shares. Upon the
exercise of the Option for cash, the proceeds of the sale of stock
subject to Options are to be added to the general funds of the
Company and used for its general corporate purposes. Any Common Stock
received for the purchase of shares upon the exercise of an Option
shall become treasury stock.</FONT>

<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;Special Rules Regarding Incentive Stock Options Granted to
Certain Employees: Unless otherwise permitted by the provisions of
the Code applicable to Incentive Stock Options, and notwithstanding
the provisions of subparagraphs&nbsp;(a) and (b) of this paragraph, no
Incentive Stock Option shall be granted to any employee who, at the
time the Option is granted, owns (directly, or within the meaning of
Section&nbsp;424(d) of the Code) more than ten percent of the total
combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or any
subsidiary corporation, unless (i)&nbsp;the Option Price under such
Incentive Stock Option is at least 110 percent of the Fair Market
Value of the stock subject to the Option at the time of the grant and
(ii)&nbsp;such Incentive Stock Option by its terms is not exercisable
after the expiration of five years from the date it is granted.

at any time at will, or as otherwise provided by any agreement

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<FONT size="2">12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WITHHOLDING:&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) In General: The Committee may, in its discretion,
require the Optionee to pay to the Company at the time of exercise
of any Non-Qualified Stock Option the amount that the Committee deems
necessary to satisfy the Company&#146;s obligation to withhold federal,
state or local income or other taxes incurred by reason of the
exercise. Upon the exercise of the Option, the Optionee may make a
written election to have shares of Common Stock then issued withheld
by the Company from the shares otherwise to be received, or to deliver
previously owned shares, in order to satisfy the liability for such
withholding taxes. The number of shares so withheld or delivered
shall have an aggregate Fair Market Value on the date of exercise
sufficient to satisfy the applicable withholding taxes.
Notwithstanding the Optionee&#146;s opportunity to make the foregoing
election, the Committee in its sole discretion will decide whether to
accept such election.
</FONT>

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<FONT size="2">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Special Rules: Where the exercise of an Option does not give rise
to an obligation by the Company to withhold federal, state or local
income or other taxes on the date of exercise, the Committee may, in
its discretion, require an Optionee to place shares of Common Stock
of the Company purchased under the Option in escrow for the benefit of the
Company until such time as such withholding is required on amounts
included in the gross income of the Optionee as a result of the
exercise of an Option. At such time, the Committee, in its discretion,
may require an Optionee to pay to the Company the amount that the
Committee deems necessary to satisfy its obligation to withhold such
taxes incurred by reason of the exercise of the Option, in which case
the shares of Common Stock of the Company will be released from escrow
to the Optionee. Alternatively, subject to acceptance by the
Committee in its sole discretion, an Optionee may make a written
election to have shares of Common Stock of the Company held in escrow
to be applied toward the Company&#146;s obligation to withhold such taxes
incurred by reason of the exercise of the Option, or to deliver
previously owned shares for such purpose, in either case based on
the Fair Market Value of the shares on the date of the termination
of the escrow arrangement. Upon application of such shares toward the
Company&#146;s withholding obligation, any shares of Common Stock of the
Company held in escrow and not, in the judgment of the Committee,
necessary to satisfy such withholding obligation shall be released
from escrow to the Optionee. In addition, subject to acceptance by
the Committee in its sole discretion, an Optionee may make a written
election to have shares of Common Stock withheld by the Company from
the shares otherwise to be received upon exercise of an Option or to
deliver to the Company previously owned shares, in either case to
satisfy any additional federal, state or local income or other taxes
applicable to the Optionee and the particular transaction, up to the
maximum marginal tax rates, whether in the case of an Option exercise
whose taxability is immediate or an Option exercise whose taxability
is deferred. The number of shares so withheld or delivered shall have
an aggregate Fair Market Value on the date withholding is required
sufficient to satisfy the applicable withholding taxes or to satisfy
taxes up to the maximum marginal tax rate as and to the extent
elected by an Optionee.

<FONT size="2">13.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DEFINITION: As used in the
Plan, the term &#145;subsidiary&#146; shall have
the meaning assigned to such term in Section&nbsp;424 of the Code and in
addition shall include both foreign and domestic subsidiaries and
any corporation which becomes a subsidiary after the date of adoption
of the Plan.

NON-QUALIFIED STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT</FONT>

<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For valuable consideration, receipt of which is hereby acknowledged,
Bowne &#038; Co., Inc., a New York corporation (the &#145;Company&#146;), hereby
grants to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(the &#145;Optionee&#146;), whose address is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,
a Non-Qualified Stock Option (&#145;Option&#146;) subject to the terms and
conditions of the 1992 Stock Option Plan of the Company (the &#145;Plan&#146;),
which Plan is incorporated herein by reference.</FONT>

<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Optionee may purchase from the Company an aggregate of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shares of
the Common Stock of the Company at an Option Price of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;per share.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Optionee may purchase the aforesaid shares on the terms
determined at the time this Option was granted by a committee of the
Board of Directors consisting of at least two non-employee directors
(the &#145;Committee&#146;). Those terms, including the Termination Date, are
as follows:</FONT>

<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Option shall, during the Optionee&#146;s lifetime, be exercisable
only by him, and neither it nor any right hereunder shall be
transferable otherwise than by will or the laws of descent and
distribution or be subject to attachment, execution or other similar
process. In the event of any attempt by the Optionee to alienate,
assign, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of this Option or
any right hereunder, except as provided for in the Plan, or in the
event of any levy or any attachment, execution or similar process
upon the rights or interest hereby conferred, the Committee may
terminate this Option by notice to the Optionee and it shall
thereupon become null and void.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject to the provisions of the Plan, this Option may be exercised
by written notice to the Company stating the number of shares with
respect to which it is being exercised and (i)&nbsp;accompanied by payment
of the Option Price by certified or bank cashier&#146;s check payable to
the order of the Company in New York Clearing House funds or,
(ii)&nbsp;if
acceptable to the Committee, by surrender or delivery to the Company
of shares of its Common Stock with a fair market value (as defined in
the Plan) equal to or less than the Option Price or through a written
election of the Optionee to have shares of Common Stock with a fair
market value (as defined in the Plan) equal to or less than the Option
Price withheld from the shares the Optionee would otherwise receive,
plus delivery of a certified or bank cashier&#146;s check for any
difference. As soon as practicable after receipt of such notice and
payment, the Company shall, without transfer or issue tax or other
incidental expense to the Optionee, deliver to the Optionee at the
offices of the Company or such other place as may be mutually
acceptable, or, at the election of the Company, by first-class
insured mail addressed to the Optionee at his address shown in the
employment records of the Company or at the location at which he is
employed by the Company or a subsidiary, a certificate or
certificates for previously unissued shares or reacquired shares of
its Common Stock, as the Company may elect.

Stock of the Company may be listed, or the requirements of the
Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or any
