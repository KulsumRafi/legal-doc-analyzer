     Section 2.4. Evidence of Debt; Use of Proceeds.

     (a) Each Lender shall  maintain in  accordance  with its usual  practice an
account or accounts  evidencing  such Lender's  portion of the Loan  outstanding
from time to time,  including the amounts of principal and interest  payable and
paid to such Lender from time to time under this Agreement.

     (b) The Agent shall  establish and maintain a register for  recording  with
respect to the Loan (i) the date and amount of each  payment on the Loan made by
or on behalf of, or collected  from, the Borrower,  (ii) the amount of each such
payment  applied in  accordance  with each  clause of Section  2.9(d) and (e) or
other applicable terms hereof to scheduled  principal of or interest on the Loan
and to each of the fees  identified  in clauses  (c),  (d),  (e), (g) and (h) of
Section 2.8 hereof,  and (iii) the date and amount of each  payment  made by the
Board under the Board Guarantee.

                                       29
<PAGE>

     (c) The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to clauses (a) and
(b) of this Section 2.4 shall,  to the extent  permitted by  applicable  law, be
prima facie  evidence of the existence and amounts of the  obligations  recorded
therein;  provided,  however,  that the  failure  of any  Lender or the Agent to
maintain  such  accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the
obligations of the Borrower to repay the Loan in accordance with its terms.

     (d) The Borrower shall execute and deliver to the Agent on the Closing Date
(i) a promissory note  substantially  in the form of Exhibit B1 in the principal
amount  of  Tranche  A of  the  Loan,  dated  the  Closing  Date  and  otherwise
appropriately  completed  (such note,  including any  replacement  note therefor
issued in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.4(d),  the "Tranche A
Note") and (ii) a promissory note substantially in the form of Exhibit B2 in the
principal  amount of Tranche B of the Loan, dated the Closing Date and otherwise
appropriately  completed  (such note,  including any  replacement  note therefor
issued in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.4(d),  the "Tranche B
Note" and,  collectively,  together with the Tranche A Note,  the "Notes").  The
Notes shall be made payable to the Agent at the office of the Agent. If any Note
is mutilated,  lost, stolen or destroyed, the Borrower shall issue a new Note in
the same principal  amount and having the same interest rate,  date and maturity
as the Note so  mutilated,  lost,  stolen or destroyed  endorsed to indicate all
payments thereon. In the case of any lost, stolen or destroyed Note, there shall
first be furnished to the Borrower and the Board an instrument of indemnity from
the  Agent  and  evidence  of  such  loss,   theft  or  destruction   reasonably
satisfactory  to each of them,  together  with an officer's  certificate  of the
Borrower  certifying and warranting as to the due  authorization,  execution and
delivery of the new Note.

     (e) This  Agreement and the Notes are  registered  instruments.  A manually
signed copy of this  Agreement  and the  original of a Note shall be evidence of
(i) the rights of each Lender  under this  Agreement  and such Note and (ii) the
rights of the Agent under this Agreement. Neither this Agreement nor any Note is
a bearer instrument. The Agent will establish and maintain a record of ownership
(the "Register") in which the Agent agrees to register by book entry the Agent's
and each Lender's interest in the Loan, the Notes and this Agreement, and in the
right to receive any payments  hereunder or thereunder and any assignment of any
such interest or rights.  In connection with any assignment  pursuant to Section
10.2,  the  Agent  shall  maintain  a copy of  each  Assignment  and  Acceptance
delivered to and accepted by it and shall record the names and  addresses of the
Lenders and  principal  amount of each  Tranche of the Loan owing to each Lender
from time to time.  The entries in the Register  shall be conclusive and binding
for all purposes,  absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the Board, the Agent
and the Lenders may treat each Person  whose name is recorded in the Register as
a Lender for all purposes of this Agreement. The Register shall be available for
inspection by the Borrower, the Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Board, the Loan
Administrator  or any Lender or Participant at any reasonable time and from time
to time upon reasonable prior notice.

     (f) The  Borrower  may use the  proceeds  from the  Loan  for such  general
corporate  purposes as are permissible under the Act and Regulations but not for


                                       30
<PAGE>

the prepayment or refinancing of any  Indebtedness  of the Borrower for borrowed
money nor for the acquisition of the stock, or of all or any substantial part of
the assets, of any Person;  provided,  however,  that the Borrower may use up to
$60,000,000  of the  proceeds  from the Loan for the  prepayment  of the Current
Credit Facility and for the cash  collateralization  of the Existing  Letters of
Credit.  No  portion of the  proceeds  from the  Borrowing  shall be used by the
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries in any manner that might cause the borrowing
or the  application  of such proceeds to violate  Regulation U,  Regulation T or
Regulation  X of the Board of  Governors  of the Federal  Reserve  System or any
other  regulation  of such Board of Governors or to violate  Section 7(c) of the
Exchange  Act, in each case as in effect on the date or dates of such  borrowing
and such use of proceeds.

     Section 2.5. Optional Prepayments.

     (a) The Borrower may, upon at least fifteen days' prior  revocable  written
notice to the Board, the Loan  Administrator  and the Agent stating the proposed
date and  aggregate  principal  amount of the  prepayment,  elect to prepay  the
outstanding  principal amount of the Loan, ratably as to each Tranche,  in whole
or in part (but not less than a minimum  amount of the lesser of $5,000,000  and
five percent of the then  outstanding  principal  amount of the Loan),  together
with accrued  interest to the date of such  prepayment on the  principal  amount
prepaid;  provided,  however,  that if any prepayment of all or a portion of the
Loan is made by the  Borrower  other than on an Interest  Payment Date or if the
Borrower  revokes such notice at any time within such fifteen days, the Borrower
shall also pay any  amounts  owing  pursuant  to Section  2.10(e)  and (f).  The
Borrower shall  establish to the  satisfaction  of the Board and the Agent three
Business  Days in advance of any  prepayment  of the Loan its ability to pay the
amount to be prepaid.

     (b) Upon the giving of any notice of  prepayment  under  clause (a) of this
Section 2.5, the principal  amount of the Loan specified to be prepaid  together
with  accrued and unpaid  interest  thereon  shall become due and payable on the
date specified for such prepayment;  provided, however, that any failure to make
any such  prepayment  in full on such date  shall be  deemed to be an  automatic
revocation  of the notice of  prepayment  given  under  Section  2.5(a) and such
failure  shall  not  constitute  a  Default  or an Event of  Default  hereunder;
provided,  further, however, that the Borrower shall be obligated to pay on such
date any amounts  owing  under  Section  2.10(e) and (f) due to such  failure to
prepay.


     (c) Any such  prepayment  shall be paid to the  Agent  for  application  as
provided in Section 2.9, and any partial  prepayment of the Loan  resulting from
such  application  shall be applied to the then  remaining  installments  of the
outstanding  principal  amount of the Loan  (ratably as to each  Tranche) in the
inverse  order  of  maturity  thereof.  The  Borrower  shall  have no  right  to
optionally  prepay the  principal  amount of the Loan other than as  provided in
this Section 2.5, Section 2.10(b) or Section 2.10(d).

                                       31

     Section 2.6. Mandatory Prepayments.

     (a) Future Issuances.  The Borrower shall give the Agent, the Lenders,  the
Participants,  the Loan Administrator and the Board not less than eight Business
Days' prior written notice of any  anticipated  Future Issuance and upon receipt
by either  Obligor or any of its  Subsidiaries  of the  proceeds  of such Future
Issuance,  the Borrower shall prepay the Loan in the manner provided below in an
amount  equal to 100% of the amount of such  proceeds  in excess of  $25,000,000
during any  Fiscal  Year,  net of any  reasonable  and  customary  brokers'  and
advisors'  fees,  any  underwriting  discounts and  commissions  and other costs
incurred in connection  with such  transaction  (provided  that evidence of such
fees, discounts,  commissions and costs is provided to the Board and the Agent);
provided,  that,  the Borrower shall not be obligated to so prepay the Loan (and
such  amounts  shall  not be  included  in the  calculation  of the  $25,000,000
threshold) if and to the extent that (x) the Borrower  applies such proceeds (i)
from an  issue  or  incurrence  of  Indebtedness  to  finance  Aircraft  Related
Equipment in a transaction  of the type  excepted  from the  definition of Asset
Sale in this Agreement,  (ii) to purchase Aircraft Related Equipment or (iii) to
refinance Indebtedness upon maturity of the refinanced  Indebtedness or (y) such
Future Issuance consists of borrowings used to refinance  Indebtedness  existing
on the date hereof on terms, in the reasonable  judgment of the Board,  that are
no less favorable  (including with respect to the repayment schedule or maturity
and the interest  rate and other fees) to the Borrower,  the Board,  the Lenders
and (solely in respect of their  interest in the  transactions  contemplated  by
this Agreement and their respective  Participations)  the Participants  than the
Indebtedness  so  refinanced;  provided,  however,  to the extent  the  Borrower
receives  any  proceeds  in  connection  with the  refinancing  of any  existing
Indebtedness  in  excess of the  amount  required  to  refinance  such  existing
Indebtedness   plus  reasonable   expenses  incurred  in  connection  with  such
refinancing, such excess proceeds shall constitute proceeds of a Future Issuance
and the Borrower  shall prepay the Loan in the manner  contemplated  above.  Any
such prepayment of the Loan shall be made on the date of receipt of the proceeds
of the applicable Future Issuance.

     (b) Asset Sales.

     (i) In the event and to the extent that on any date after the Closing  Date
either Obligor or any of its  Subsidiaries  shall receive Net Cash Proceeds from
one  or  more  Asset  Sales  (other  than  Asset  Sales  by  the  Parent  or any
Wholly-Owned  Subsidiary  of the Parent to the  Parent or  another  Wholly-Owned
Subsidiary of the Parent) in excess of $2,500,000  during any Fiscal Year,  then
the  Parent or the  Borrower,  as the case may be,  shall,  or shall  cause such
Subsidiary  to,  promptly  apply  such  excess  amount as  required  by  Section
2.6(b)(ii)  below.  The amount of such Net Cash Proceeds  required to be applied
(or to be committed  to be applied)  during such Fiscal Year as set forth in the
preceding sentence shall constitute "Excess Proceeds".

     (ii) No later than six Business Days following the date on which any Excess
Proceeds are received as contemplated in Section  2.6(b)(i)  above, the Borrower
shall prepay the Loan in an aggregate amount equal to such Excess Proceeds.

                                       32
<PAGE>

     (c) Insurance/Condemnation  Proceeds. The Borrower shall prepay the Loan in
an amount equal to the amount by which the aggregate amount of all Net Insurance
Proceeds and Net Condemnation Proceeds received by either of the Obligors or any
of their Subsidiaries in any Fiscal Year exceeds $2,500,000; provided, that, the
Borrower  shall not be obligated to so prepay the Loan if and to the extent that
the  Borrower  certifies  to the Board  that the  recipient  intends  to repair,
restore or replace  the assets  from which such Net  Insurance  Proceeds  or Net
Condemnation  Proceeds  derived,  and  does  so (or  enters  into  a  definitive
agreement  committing  to do so)  within  6  months  after  receipt  of such Net
Insurance  Proceeds  or Net  Condemnation  Proceeds  (or in the case of proceeds
derived from Collateral,  the Borrower repairs,  restores or replaces the assets
from which such proceeds derived in accordance with the applicable provisions of
the Security Agreement). Any prepayment pursuant to this Section 2.6(c) shall be
made no later than six Business  Days  following  the date of receipt of the Net
Insurance  Proceeds or Net  Condemnation  Proceeds  by either  Obligor or any of
their Subsidiaries,  or if later, the six-month period referenced above (or such
later  date as it is  determined  that  the  proceeds  will  not be  applied  in
accordance with an agreement entered into within such six-month  period),  or in
the case of  proceeds  derived  from  Collateral  and for  which  the  timing of
prepayment is otherwise provided for in Section 3.01 of the Security  Agreement,
at such time as determined in accordance with the applicable provisions thereof.

     (d) Change in  Control.  Upon the  occurrence  of a Change in Control  with
respect to either the Parent or the Borrower,  the Borrower  shall promptly give
the Agent,  the Lenders,  the Loan  Administrator  and the Board written  notice
thereof,  and the Board shall have the right,  by written notice to the Borrower
(with a copy to the Agent,  each Participant and each Lender) delivered not more
than 30 days  following  delivery  of the  notice of the Change in  Control,  to
require  the  Borrower  to prepay the Loan in full,  together  with  accrued and
unpaid interest thereon to the date of such prepayment, on the date specified in
such notice  (which date shall be a Business Day not less than ten nor more than
twenty  Business  Days' after the date of such  notice),  and upon the specified
payment date, the Borrower shall so prepay the then outstanding principal amount
of the Loan together with such accrued and unpaid interest thereon.

     (e) Application.  If any such prepayment is made by the Borrower other than
on an Interest  Payment  Date,  the  Borrower  shall also pay any amounts  owing
pursuant to Section  2.10(e) and (f). Any such  prepayment  of the Loan shall be
paid to the Agent for  application  as provided in Section  2.9, and any partial
prepayment of the Loan resulting from such  application  shall be applied to the
then remaining  installments  of the outstanding  principal  balance of the Loan
(ratably as to each Tranche) in the inverse order of maturity thereof.

     Section 2.7. Interest.

     (a) Tranche A Rate of  Interest.  Except as  otherwise  provided in Section
2.7(d) and Section 2.10, Tranche A of the Loan shall bear interest on the unpaid
principal  amount  thereof  from  the  Closing  Date  until  paid in full at the
Applicable Tranche A Interest Rate.

                                       33
<PAGE>

     (b) Tranche B Rate of  Interest.  Except as  otherwise  provided in Section
2.7(e) and Section 2.10, Tranche B of the Loan shall bear interest on the unpaid
principal  amount  thereof  from  the  Closing  Date  until  paid in full at the
Applicable Tranche B Interest Rate.

     (c)  Interest  Payments.  Interest  accrued on each Tranche of the Loan and
each Note shall be payable in arrears on each Interest  Payment Date  commencing
February 25, 2003,  upon the payment or prepayment  thereof in whole or in part,
and, if not previously  paid in full, at maturity  (whether by  acceleration  or
otherwise).  Interest  on each  Tranche of the Loan shall be  calculated  on the
basis of a year of 360 days and actual number of days elapsed.

     (d)  Tranche  A  Default  Interest.  Notwithstanding  the rate of  interest
specified in Section 2.7(a) or elsewhere herein, if any principal of or interest
on Tranche A of the Loan is not paid when due, whether at stated maturity,  upon
acceleration, by mandatory prepayment or otherwise (but other than any voluntary
prepayment),  such  overdue  amount  shall bear  interest at a rate which is two
percent  per annum in excess of the  Applicable  Tranche A  Interest  Rate as in
effect from time to time.

     (e)  Default  Interest on Tranche B;  Interest  on Fees and Other  Amounts.
Notwithstanding  the rate of interest  specified in Section  2.7(b) or elsewhere
herein,  if any  principal of or interest on Tranche B of the Loan or any fee or
other amount payable by the Borrower  hereunder  (except for any amounts payable
under Section  2.7(d)) is not paid when due,  whether at stated  maturity,  upon
acceleration, by mandatory prepayment or otherwise (but other than any voluntary
prepayment),  such  overdue  amount  shall bear  interest at a rate which is two
percent  per annum in excess of the  Applicable  Tranche B  Interest  Rate as in
effect from time to time.

requests that the Loan  Administrator  provide any of the services  described in
Sections   8.1(b)(vii)   through   (ix),   8.1(b)(xiv)   and   (xv),   the  Loan
Administrator's  fee for each of such services  shall be equal to the product of
(A) the total number of hours actually worked  performing such services,  as set

participation  in  its  portion  of  the  Loan  to  any  Person  the  sale  of a
participation  to which would not require the Board's consent if the Regulations
were then as in effect on the Closing  Date and (ii) any such  Lender  seeks the

then such Lender  shall so notify the  Borrower  and the Agent and the  Borrower
shall thereafter (until such consent may be granted) pay to the Agent for the

account of such Lender a liquidity  fee equal to  [...***...]  of the  principal
amount  of the Loan  outstanding  from time to time  held by such  Lender,  such
liquidity  fee to accrue from the date of such notice from such Lender and to be
payable on each Interest Payment Date.

     (j)  Distribution  of Fees.  On the  Closing  Date,  and  upon its  receipt
thereof,  the Agent shall  distribute to the Person entitled thereto each of the

Dollars, to the Agent at [...***...]. All payments in respect of any Obligations

payments  received by it to be  distributed  to the Person  entitled  thereto in
accordance  with the  priorities of payment set forth below in clause (d) or (e)

next  succeeding  Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be
included in the computation of payment of interest or fees, as the case may be.

     (d) So long as no Event of Default under any of Sections 7.1(a)  (including
any failure to pay all amounts  hereunder upon  acceleration  as a result of any
other Event of Default),  (f) and (g) has occurred  and is  continuing  or would
result  therefrom,  the  Agent  shall  apply  all  payments  in  respect  of any
Obligations in the following order:

     (i) first, to pay any fees then due and payable under Section 2.8(c),  (d),
(e)  and  (g)  hereof  to  the  Agent,   the  Collateral   Agent  and  the  Loan
Administrator, as the case may be, on a pro rata basis;

                                             ***Confidential Treatment Requested

                                       36
<PAGE>

     (ii) second, to pay interest then due and payable in respect of the Loan to
the Lenders, on a pro rata basis;

     (iii)  third,  to pay  principal  then due and  payable  on the Loan to the
Lenders, on a pro rata basis;

     (iv) fourth,  to pay any fees then due and payable under Section 2.8(h) and
(i)  hereof  to the  Board  and the  Lenders,  as the case may be, on a pro rata
basis; and

     (v) fifth, to pay any other  Obligations then due and payable to the Agent,
the  Collateral  Agent,  the Loan  Administrator,  the Board,  the Lenders,  the
Participants and the Govco Administrative Agent, on a pro rata basis.

     Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  to the extent that any amount  received by
the Agent  constitutes  interest accrued on any overdue principal of or interest
on  Tranche A of the Loan in excess of the  interest  that  would  have  accrued
thereon at the Applicable  Tranche A Interest  Rate, so much of such amount,  if
any,  as exceeds  the  interest  that  would  have so accrued at the  Applicable
Tranche A Interest  Rate shall be  distributed  to the Board  under  clause (ii)
above as if it were a Lender and the balance shall be distributed to the Tranche
A Lenders under clause (ii) above.

     (e) After the occurrence and during the  continuance of an Event of Default
under any of Sections 7.1(a) (including any failure to pay all amounts hereunder
upon  acceleration as a result of any other Event of Default),  (f) and (g), the
Agent shall apply all payments in respect of any  Obligations  in the  following
order:


     (i) first, to pay Obligations in respect of any expenses,  fees (other than
any fees  payable  under  clause  (v)  below),  indemnities  or other sums owing
hereunder  not  referred to in clauses  (ii)  through (iv) below then due to the
Agent,  the  Collateral  Agent,  the  Lenders or the Board (to the extent of any
out-of-pocket  costs and expenses  incurred  pursuant to Section 9.7(b)) and the
Loan Administrator, on a pro rata basis;

     (ii) second,  to pay  Obligations  in respect of any expenses,  fees (other
than any fees payable under clause (v) below),  indemnities  or other sums owing
hereunder not referred to in clauses (iii) and (iv) below then due to the Board,
the Lenders, the Participants and the Govco Administrative  Agent, on a pro rata
basis;

     (iii) third, to pay on a pro rata basis,  (A) interest then due and payable
in respect of the Loan to the Lenders, on a pro rata basis, and (B) in the event
that any fees payable to the Board under  Section  2.8(h) were not paid when due
under  Section  2.8(h),  the  portion of such  unpaid fees which is equal to the
amount which the Board would have been entitled to receive  through such date if
the fee payable under Section  2.8(h) were payable daily in arrears  (instead of
quarterly in advance);

                                       37
<PAGE>

     (iv)  fourth,  to pay or  prepay  principal  payments  on the  Loan  to the
Lenders, on a pro rata basis; and

     (v) fifth,  to pay any additional fees payable under Section 2.8(h) and (i)
hereof to the Board and the Lenders, respectively, on a pro rata basis.

     Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  to the extent that any amount  received by
the Agent  constitutes  interest accrued on any overdue principal of or interest
on  Tranche A of the Loan in excess of the  interest  that  would  have  accrued
thereon at the Applicable  Tranche A Interest  Rate, so much of such amount,  if
any,  as exceeds  the  interest  that  would  have so accrued at the  Applicable
Tranche A Interest  Rate shall be  distributed  to the Board under  clause (iii)
above as if it were a Lender and the balance shall be distributed to the Tranche
A Lenders under clause (iii) above.

     (f) Upon the assignment to the Board of any Tranche A Lender's right, title
and interest in and to its pro rata portion of the  principal of and interest on
Tranche A of the Loan in accordance  with the Board  Guarantee,  the Board shall
have the rights and  privileges of a Lender with respect to such payment (to the
extent of the interests in Tranche A of the Loan so assigned to the Board).  Any
statute or judicial decision to the contrary notwithstanding,  no payment by the
Board to the Agent or any  Tranche A Lender  under  the Board  Guarantee,  shall
reduce, discharge, satisfy, modify or terminate the corresponding payment or any
other obligation of Borrower under this Agreement or Tranche A Note, which shall
remain in full force and effect.

     Section     2.10.     Certain     Provisions     Governing    the    Notes.


     (a) Determination of Interest Rate. The Applicable  Tranche A Interest Rate
and  Applicable  Tranche B Interest  Rate for each  Interest  Period of the Loan
shall be determined by the Govco  Administrative Agent and/or the Agent pursuant
to the procedures set forth in the definition of "Applicable  Tranche A Interest
Rate",  "Applicable  Tranche B Interest Rate" and "LIBOR",  as  applicable,  and
shall promptly  thereafter be notified to the Borrower,  the Board,  each Lender
and each Participant.

     (b) Interest Rate Unascertainable, Inadequate or Unfair. In the event that:
(i) the  Agent  determines  that  adequate  and  fair  means  do not  exist  for
ascertaining the applicable  interest rates by reference to which the LIBOR then
being  determined is to be fixed; or (ii) the Requisite LIBOR Lenders notify the
Agent that the LIBOR for any  Interest  Period will not  adequately  reflect the
cost to the LIBOR  Lenders of making or  maintaining  the Loan for such Interest
Period,  the Agent  shall  forthwith  so notify the  Borrower,  the  Board,  the
Participants and the Lenders, whereupon during the 30 days following the date of
any such notice the LIBOR Lenders,  the Agent, the Participants and the Borrower
shall  negotiate in good faith (subject to the consent of the Board) in order to
arrive at a mutually  acceptable  alternative basis for determining the interest
rate from time to time  applicable  to the  relevant  Tranche or Tranches of the
Loan (the "Substitute  Basis").  If within the 20 days following the date of any
such notice from the Agent, the LIBOR Lenders,  the Participants,  the Agent and

                                       38
<PAGE>

the  Borrower  shall agree upon,  and the Board shall  consent to, a  Substitute
Basis,  such  Substitute  Basis shall be  retroactive  to and effective from the
first day of the then current  Interest  Period until and including the last day
of such  Interest  Period.  If after 20 days from the date of such  notice,  the
LIBOR Lenders, the Participants, the Agent and the Borrower shall have failed to
agree upon,  or the Board shall have failed to consent to, a  Substitute  Basis,
then the Agent  (upon  instructions  from the  Requisite  LIBOR  Lenders)  shall
certify in writing to the Borrower  (such  certification  to be  conclusive  and
binding on all LIBOR Lenders and all other parties hereto absent manifest error)
the  interest  rate at which the LIBOR  Lenders are  prepared to maintain  their
portion of the Loan for such  Interest  Period,  it being  understood  that such
Lenders'  interest  rate  shall be at a rate  per  annum  equal to a rate  which
adequately and fairly reflects the cost to such Lenders and the  Participants of
obtaining  the funds  necessary to maintain  their  portion of the Loan for such
Interest Period.  If no Substitute Basis is established,  upon receipt of notice
of the  interest  rates at which the  Requisite  LIBOR  Lenders are  prepared to
maintain their respective portion of the Loan, the Borrower shall have the right
exercisable   upon  ten  Business  Days'  prior  notice  to  the  Lenders,   the
Participants  and the Board through the Agent (i) to continue to borrow the Loan
at the interest rate so advised by the Agent (as such rate may be modified, from
time to time,  at the  outset of each  subsequent  Interest  Period)  or (ii) to
prepay in full the Loan together with accrued but unpaid interest thereon at the
interest rate  certified in writing by the  Requisite  LIBOR Lenders as provided
above and all other  amounts due under the Loan  Documents,  whereupon  the Loan
shall  become due and  payable on the date  specified  by the  Borrower  in such
notice.


     (c)  Increased  Costs.  If at any  time any  Lender  or  Participant  shall
determine  that as a result of the  introduction  of or any  change in or in the
interpretation by any Governmental  Authority of any law, treaty or governmental
rule, regulation or order after the date hereof or the compliance by such Lender
or Participant,  with any guideline,  request or directive after the date hereof
from any central bank or other Governmental Authority (whether or not having the
force of  law),  there  shall be any  increase  in the  cost to such  Lender  or
Participant of agreeing to make or making, funding or maintaining any portion of
the Loan or its Participation (except in respect of Taxes, payments with respect
to which are addressed in Section  2.12),  then the Borrower  shall from time to
time,  upon demand (which  demand shall be  accompanied  by a statement  setting
forth the basis for such  demand  and a  calculation  of the  amount  thereof in
reasonable  detail) by such  Lender or  Participant,  as the case may be (with a
copy of such  demand to the  Agent),  pay to the Agent for the  account  of such
Lender or  Participant,  as the case may be,  additional  amounts  sufficient to
compensate  such Lender or  Participant,  as the case may be, for such increased
cost. A certificate  as to the amount of such increased  cost,  submitted to the
Borrower and the Agent by such Lender or Participant,  as the case may be, shall
be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.


     (d) Illegality.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,  if
any Lender or Participant  determines that the  introduction of or any change in
or in the  interpretation  by any  Governmental  Authority of any law, treaty or
governmental  rule,  regulation or order after the date of this Agreement  shall
make it unlawful,  or any central  bank or other  Governmental  Authority  shall
assert that it is unlawful,  for such Lender or  Participant to continue to fund
or maintain its portion of the Loan or  Participation,  as applicable,  then, on


                                       39
<PAGE>

notice thereof by such Lender or Participant, to the Borrower through the Agent,
the obligation of such Lender or Participant to continue to fund or maintain its
portion of the Loan or Participation, as applicable, shall be terminated and the
Borrower  shall prepay such affected  portion of the Loan to such Lender,  or in
the case of a  Participant,  to the Tranche B Lender,  together with accrued but
unpaid  interest  thereon  and all other sums  payable  hereunder  with  respect
thereto  on the last day of the then  current  Interest  Period  or  earlier  if
necessary to avoid such  illegality.  Any such  prepayment  of the Loan shall be
paid to the Agent for  application  as  provided  in Section  2.9,  and any such
partial  prepayment  resulting from such application shall be applied ratably to
the then unpaid installments  thereof in accordance with the amount of each such
unpaid installment.

     (e)  Prepayment  Compensation.  In connection  with all  prepayments  under
Section 2.5,  2.6,  2.10(b) or 2.10(d),  if the Primary  Tranche A Lender is the
Tranche A Lender,  the Borrower  shall pay to such  Primary  Tranche A Lender an
amount  equal to (A) the  amount of yield that the  Primary  Tranche A Lender is
required to pay to holders of its Commercial Paper during the Liquidation Period
on an amount of  Commercial  Paper having an aggregate  issue price equal to the
amount  of the  Borrower's  prepayment  less  (B) the  amount  of the  estimated
investment earnings, as reasonably determined by the Govco Administrative Agent,
on the prepayment amount during the Liquidation Period.


     "Liquidation  Period"  means the period from the date on which a prepayment
is made to the  earliest  date on which the  Primary  Tranche A  Lender's  total
amount of  Commercial  Paper related to the funding of Tranche A of the Loan can
be reduced (without  prepayment thereof) by an amount equal to the amount of the
Borrower's prepayment.


     (f) Breakage Costs.  In addition to all amounts  required to be paid by the
Borrower pursuant to Section 2.7 but without  duplication of any amounts payable
under  Section  2.10(e),  the  Borrower  shall  compensate  each Lender and each
Participant,  upon demand, for all losses,  expenses and liabilities  (including
any loss or expense  incurred by reason of the  liquidation or  reemployment  of
deposits  or  other  funds  acquired  by  such  Lender  or  Participant  or  the
termination of any other financial  arrangement it may have entered into to fund
or  maintain  or support  such  Lender's  portion  of the Loan or  Participant's
Participation,  as  applicable,  but excluding  Taxes,  payments with respect to
which are  addressed in Section 2.12) which that Lender or  Participant,  as the
case may be, may sustain (i) if for any reason the proposed  Borrowing  does not
occur  on a date  specified  therefor  in the  Notice  of  Borrowing  given by a
Borrower,  (ii) if for any reason any portion of the Loan is prepaid  (including
mandatorily pursuant to Section 2.6 or this Section 2.10) or as a result of such
a prepayment, payment is made with respect to a Participation on a date which is
not the last day of the applicable Interest Period, or (iii) as a consequence of
any failure by a Borrower to repay any portion of the Loan or make  payment with
respect to a  Participation  when  required by the terms  hereof.  The Lender or
Participant  making demand for such  compensation  shall deliver to the Borrower
(with a copy to the Agent)  concurrently with such demand a written statement as

                                       40
<PAGE>

to such losses, expenses and liabilities, and this statement shall be conclusive
as to the amount of compensation due to that Lender or Participant,  as the case
may be, absent manifest error, and such compensation  shall be paid to the Agent
for the account of such Lender or Participant, as the case may be.

     Section 2.11.  Capital  Adequacy.  If at any time any Lender or Participant
determines that (a) the adoption of or any change in or in the interpretation by
any Governmental  Authority of any law, treaty or governmental rule,  regulation
or order  after  the date of this  Agreement  regarding  capital  adequacy,  (b)
compliance  with any such  law,  treaty,  rule,  regulation,  or  order,  or (c)
compliance  with any guideline or request or directive  from any central bank or
other Governmental Authority (whether or not having the force of law) shall have
the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or Participant's  (or
any  corporation  controlling  such  Lender's  or  Participant's)  capital  as a
consequence of its obligations  hereunder  (other than as a result of changes in
Taxes,  payments with respect to which are addressed in Section 2.12) to a level
below  that  which  such  Lender  or  Participant,  as the case may be,  or such
corporation  could have achieved but for such  adoption,  change,  compliance or
interpretation,  then,  upon  demand  from  time  to  time  by  such  Lender  or
Participant,  as the case may be (with a copy of such demand to the Agent),  the
Borrower  shall pay to the Agent for the account of such Lender or  Participant,
as the  case  may  be,  from  time  to  time as  specified  by  such  Lender  or
Participant,  as the case may be,  additional  amounts  sufficient to compensate
such Lender or Participant for such reduction.  A certificate as to such amounts
submitted to the Borrower  and the Agent by such Lender or  Participant,  as the
case may be, shall be conclusive  and binding for all purposes  absent  manifest
error.

     Section 2.12. Taxes.


     (a) Except as otherwise  provided in Section 10.2,  any and all payments by
the  Borrower  under  each  Loan  Document  (including  payments  made  under  a
Participation  Agreement to a  Participant,  but excluding such payments made to
participants  other than  Participants,  except as expressly provided in Section
2.12(j))  shall be made free and clear of and without  deduction for any and all
Taxes,  excluding (i) in the case of each Lender, the Loan Administrator and the
Agent, taxes measured by its net income or net profits (or branch profits),  and
franchise taxes imposed on it, by the United States of America (or any political
subdivision thereof) or by any jurisdiction under the laws of which such Lender,
the Loan  Administrator or the Agent (as the case may be) is organized,  (ii) in
the case of each  Lender,  taxes  measured  by its net income or net profits (or
branch profits), and franchise taxes imposed on it, by the jurisdiction in which
such Lender's Lending Office is located,  (iii) in the case of each Lender,  the
Loan  Administrator  and the Agent,  Taxes  imposed  as a result of such  Person
failing to comply with its obligations under Section 2.12(g) or 2.12(h) and (iv)
in the case of each  Lender,  the Loan  Administrator,  and the Agent  that is a
party hereto,  as the case may be, any  withholding  taxes imposed by the United
States of America (or any political  subdivision  thereof)  unless  imposed as a
result of a change in applicable law,  including income tax  conventions,  after
the latest of (x) the Closing  Date,  (y) the date on which it becomes a Lender,
the Loan  Administrator or the Agent, as the case may be, and (z) in the case of
a Lender,  the date on which it  designates  a new Lending  Office,  unless such
designation is pursuant to Section  2.12(h) (all such  non-excluded  Taxes being

                                       41
<PAGE>

hereinafter referred to as "Indemnified  Taxes"). If any Indemnified Taxes shall
be required by law to be  deducted  from or in respect of any sum payable  under
any Loan Document to any Lender,  the Loan  Administrator,  or the Agent (i) the
sum payable  shall be  increased  as may be  necessary  so that after making all
required deductions  (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable
under this Section 2.12) such Lender,  the Loan  Administrator  or the Agent (as
the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have  received had
no such deductions been made, (ii) the Borrower shall make such deductions,  and
(iii) the Borrower  shall pay the full amount  deducted to the  relevant  taxing
authority or other authority in accordance with applicable law.

     (b) In addition,  the Borrower agrees to pay any present or future stamp or
documentary  taxes or any other  excise or  property  taxes,  charges or similar
levies  of  the  United  States  or any  political  subdivision  thereof  or any
applicable foreign jurisdiction, and all liabilities with respect thereto, which
arise from any payment made under any Loan Document or Participation or from the
execution,  delivery or registration  of, or otherwise with respect to, any Loan
Document  (collectively,  "Other  Taxes")  to the Agent for the  account  of the
affected party.


     (c) The  Borrower  will  indemnify  each  Lender,  the  Agent  and the Loan
Administrator for the full amount of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes (including
any Taxes  imposed by any  jurisdiction  on amounts  payable  under this Section
2.12) paid by such Lender,  the Loan Administrator or the Agent (as the case may
be) and any liability  (including for penalties,  interest and expenses) arising
therefrom or with respect  thereto.  This  indemnification  shall be made to the
Agent for account of the relevant Lender,  the Loan  Administrator or the Agent,
as the  case  may be,  within  30 days  from  the  date  such  Lender,  the Loan
Administrator  or the Agent (as the case may be) makes written  demand  therefor
(with a copy to the  Agent if made by a Lender  or the  Loan  Administrator  and
accompanied  by a statement  setting  forth the basis for such  taxation and the
calculation of the amount thereof in reasonable detail).

     (d) Within 30 days after the date of any  payment of  Indemnified  Taxes or
Other Taxes,  the Borrower will furnish to the Agent the original or a certified
copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof or other  documentation  reasonably
satisfactory to the Agent.

     (e) If a Lender,  the Loan  Administrator or the Agent receives a refund in
respect  of any  Indemnified  Taxes  or  Other  Taxes  as to  which  it has been
indemnified  by the Borrower  pursuant to this Section  2.12, it shall within 30
days  from the  date of such  receipt  pay  over  such  refund  to the  Borrower
hereunder,  net  of  any  additional  Taxes  incurred  due  to  such  refund  or
out-of-pocket  expenses of such Lender, the Loan Administrator or the Agent as a
result of such  refund or payment  hereunder  and without  interest  (other than
interest  paid by the  relevant  Governmental  Authority  with  respect  to such
refund);  provided,  that no  Default or Event of  Default  is  continuing,  and
provided further,  that the Borrower hereunder,  upon the request of such Lender
or the  Agent,  agrees  to repay the  amount  paid  over to the  Borrower  (plus
penalties,  interest or other  charges) to such Lender or the Agent in the event
such Lender or the Agent is  required to repay such refund to such  Governmental
Authority.

                                       42
<PAGE>

     (f)  Without  prejudice  to the  survival  of any  other  agreement  of the
Borrower  hereunder,  the agreements and obligations of the parties contained in
this  Section  2.12  shall  survive  the  payment  in full  of the  Obligations;
provided,  however,  that no such  agreements or  obligations  shall survive the
statute of  limitations  applicable  to the  relevant  Taxes  unless a claim was
properly made prior to the expiration of such statute.

     (g) Each of the  Lenders,  the Loan  Administrator  and the Agent that is a
Non-U.S.  Person and that is entitled at such time to an  exemption  from United
States  withholding  tax, or that is subject to such tax at a reduced rate under
an applicable tax treaty,  shall, on or prior to the Closing Date or on or prior
to the date of the  Assignment  and  Acceptance  pursuant  to which it becomes a
Lender  or on or prior  to the date it  becomes  the Loan  Administrator  or the
Agent, as applicable, and from time to time thereafter if requested by the Agent
or the Borrower or if necessary to keep the provided forms from lapsing, provide
the Agent and the  Borrower,  and,  in the case of each of the  Lenders  and the
Agent,  provide each  Participant,  with two completed copies of either IRS Form
W-8BEN or W-8ECI or other applicable form, certificate or document prescribed by
the IRS  certifying as to such Non-U.S.  Person's  entitlement to such exemption
from United States  withholding tax or reduced rate with respect to all payments
to be made to such Non-U.S.  Person under the Loan Documents.  In addition, each
of the Lenders, each Participant, the Loan Administrator and the Agent that is a
Non-U.S.  Person,  as the case may be,  shall  deliver to the  Borrower  and the
Agent, and, in the case of each of the Lenders,  each Participant and the Agent,
deliver  to each  Participant,  notice  of any  event  (other  than a change  in
applicable law, including income tax conventions) requiring a change in the most
recent form previously delivered by such Person to the Borrower and the Agent or
the  Participants,  as the case may be.  Unless the Agent and the Borrower  have
received forms or other documents  satisfactory to them indicating that payments
under the Loan Documents or  Participation  to or for a Non-U.S.  Person are not
subject to United  States  withholding  tax or are subject to such tax at a rate
reduced  by  an  applicable  tax  treaty,  the  Agent  or  the  Borrower  shall,
notwithstanding  the  provisions  of Section  2.12(a),  (b) and (d) and  without
impairing any obligation of the Borrower under this Section 2.12 with respect to
such tax,  withhold such United States  withholding  taxes from such payments at
the appropriate rate.


     (h) Any Lender  claiming any additional  amounts  payable  pursuant to this
Section  2.12 shall use its  reasonable  efforts  (consistent  with its internal
policy and legal and regulatory  restrictions) to change the jurisdiction of its
Lending  Office if the  making  of such a change  would  avoid the need for,  or
reduce the amount of, any such additional  amounts which would be payable or may
thereafter  accrue and would not, in the sole  determination of such Lender,  be
otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender.

     (i) Each  participant  in the Loan will be  entitled  to the  benefits  and
subject to the  requirements  of this Section 2.12 to the same extent as if such
Person were a Lender;  provided,  however,  that a  participant  (including  all
Participants)  shall not be entitled to indemnification or payment of additional
amounts  under this  Section  2.12 with respect to any Taxes which are in effect
and  would  apply to  amounts  payable  to such  participant  on the  date  such
participant acquires its participation (except that such date shall be deemed to

                                       43
<PAGE>

be the Closing Date in the case of [...***...]

     (j)  Each   direct   subparticipant   of  a   Participant   who  becomes  a
subparticipant  pursuant to Section 10.2(f) will be entitled to the benefits and
subject to the  requirements  of this Section 2.12 to the same extent as if such
Person were a Participant and as if the subparticipation  agreement entered into
by such subparticipant were a Participation Agreement;  provided,  however, that
whenever  both  such a  subparticipant  and  its  applicable  Participant  would
otherwise be entitled to payment of additional  amounts or to an indemnity under
this Section  2.12,  the Borrower  shall only be obliged to pay such  additional
amounts  or make  such an  indemnity  with  respect  to no more than one of such
subparticipant  and such  applicable  Participant,  whichever  would require the
greater payment of such additional amount and provision of such indemnity by the
Borrower.  Except as provided in the foregoing  sentence,  no subparticipants of
any participant or subparticipant shall be entitled to any payment of additional
amounts or indemnification under this Section 2.12.



                                  Article III

                               Conditions To Loan

     Section  3.1.  Conditions  Precedent  to the Loan.  The  obligation  of the
Lenders to make the Loan (or,  in the case of the Primary  Tranche A Lender,  to
agree to  participate  in the  making of the Loan  subject  to  Section  2.1(b))
requested  to be made by the  Lenders  on the  Closing  Date is  subject  to the
satisfaction (in the judgment of the Agent, the Board,  each Participant and the
Lenders (except as otherwise  provided below in this Section 3.1)) of all of the
following conditions precedent before or concurrently with such Borrowing:

     (a) Certain Documents.  The Agent, the Lenders, each Participant (except as
to clauses (iv),  (x)(G) through (L), (xiii) and (xiv),  for opinions of counsel

     To induce the other  parties to enter  into this  Agreement,  to induce the
Board to enter into the Board Guarantee and to induce the  Participants to enter
into their respective  Participations,  each Obligor  represents and warrants to
each other party hereto and to each  Participant  that, on and as of the Closing
Date:

                                       49

     Section 4.1. Organization,  Powers, Qualification, Good Standing, Business,
Subsidiaries, the Act and the Regulations.

     (a) Each Obligor is a corporation  duly organized,  validly existing and in
good  standing  under the laws of the State of  Indiana.  Each  Obligor  has all
requisite  corporate  and  other  power and  authority  to own and  operate  its
properties,  to carry on its  business  as now  conducted  and as proposed to be
conducted,  to enter into the Loan Documents to which it is a party and to carry
out the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.

     (b) Each Obligor and each of their Subsidiaries is qualified to do business
and in good  standing  in every  jurisdiction  where its assets are  located and
wherever  necessary  to  carry  out  its  business  and  operations,  except  in
jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing could not
reasonably  be expected to have a Material  Adverse  Effect.  The Borrower is an
"air  carrier"  within  the  meaning  of the Act and holds a  certificate  under
Sections  41102(a)(1) and 41103 of Title 49. Each of the Borrower and each other
Subsidiary of the Parent engaged in operations as an "air carrier" is a "citizen
of the United States" as defined in Section  40102(a)(15) of Title 49 (a "United
States Citizen") and holds an air carrier operating  certificate issued pursuant
to  Chapter  447 of  Title  49 for  aircraft  capable  of  carrying  10 or  more
individuals  or 6,000  pounds or more of cargo.  Each  Obligor and each of their
Subsidiaries  possesses  all  necessary  certificates,   franchises,   licenses,
permits, rights and concessions and consents which are material to the operation
of the routes  flown by it and the conduct of its  business  and  operations  as
currently conducted.

     (c) All of the  Subsidiaries  of the  Obligors as of the  Closing  Date are
identified on Schedule 4.1, as said Schedule 4.1 may be  supplemented  from time
to time pursuant to the  provisions of Section  5.15.  Each of the  Subsidiaries
identified  in  Schedule  4.1  annexed  hereto  (as  so  supplemented)  is  duly
organized,  validly  existing  and  in  good  standing  under  the  laws  of its
respective  jurisdiction  of  formation  set forth  therein,  has all  requisite
corporate,  partnership  or limited  liability  power and  authority  to own and
operate its  properties  and to carry on its  business as now  conducted  and as
proposed to be  conducted,  and is qualified to do business and in good standing
in every  jurisdiction  where its assets are located and  wherever  necessary to
carry out its business and  operations,  in each case except where failure to be
so qualified or in good  standing or a lack of such  corporate,  partnership  or
limited liability power and authority could not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.  Schedule 4.1 (as so supplemented) correctly sets forth
the ownership interest of the Obligors and each of their Subsidiaries in each of
the Subsidiaries  identified  therein.  There are no limitations on the right of
any Obligor to vote the Capital Stock it owns of any Subsidiary of such Obligor.

     (d) The  Borrower is an "eligible  borrower"  within the meaning of the Act
and the Regulations,  it does not have any outstanding  delinquent  Federal debt
(including  tax  liabilities),  and the  Application  (together with any written
materials set forth in the certificate referred to in Section 3.1(a)(xvii)), the
Loan, the Participations and the transactions contemplated hereby (assuming each
Lender is an Eligible  Lender and each  Participant  qualifies as a  participant

corporate  action the execution,  delivery and performance of the Loan Documents
to which it is a party.

     (b) The execution, delivery and performance by each Obligor and each of its
Subsidiaries  of the Loan Documents to which it is a party and the  consummation
of the transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents to which it is a party do
not and will not (i) violate any provision of any law or any  governmental  rule
or  regulation  applicable  to either  Obligor or any of its  Subsidiaries,  the
Certificate or Articles of  Incorporation  or Bylaws of either Obligor or any of
its  Subsidiaries or any order,  judgment or decree of any court or other agency
of government binding on either Obligor or any of either Obligor's Subsidiaries,
(ii)  conflict  with,  result in a breach of or  constitute  (with due notice or
lapse of time or both) a default  or  require  any  payment  under any  material
Contractual  Obligation  (including the Concessions) of either Obligor or any of
its  Subsidiaries,  (iii) result in or require the creation or imposition of any
Lien upon any of the  properties  or assets of either  Obligor  or any of either
Obligor's  Subsidiaries  (other than  pursuant to the Loan  Documents),  or (iv)
require any  approval of  stockholders  or any approval or consent of any Person
under any material  Contractual  Obligation  of either  Obligor or any of either
Obligor's  Subsidiaries,  except for such  approvals or consents which will have
been obtained on or before the Closing Date.

     (c) The execution, delivery and performance by each Obligor and each of its
Subsidiaries  of the Loan Documents to which it is a party and the  consummation
of the transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents to which it is a party do
not and will not  require any  registration  with,  consent or  approval  of, or
notice  to,  or  other  action  to,  with or by,  any  federal,  state  or other
Governmental  Authority or regulatory  body or any other  Person,  except as set
forth on Schedule  4.2, and each of the actions  listed on Schedule 4.2 which is
required to be obtained or made on or prior to the Closing  Date has  previously
been obtained or made.

     (d)  Each  Obligor  and each of its  Subsidiaries  has  duly  executed  and
delivered  each of the Loan  Documents  to which it is party  and each such Loan
Document is the legally  valid and binding  obligation  of such  Obligor or such
Subsidiary,  as applicable,  enforceable against such Obligor or such Subsidiary
in  accordance  with  its  terms,  except  as  may  be  limited  by  bankruptcy,
insolvency,  reorganization,  moratorium,  fraudulent  transfer or other similar
laws relating to or affecting the  enforcement of creditors'  rights  generally,
and by general  principles  of equity  (regardless  of whether  considered  in a
proceeding in equity or at law).

consistently  applied and fairly present the consolidated  financial position of
such Obligor as at the respective dates thereof and the consolidated  results of
operations  and cash flows of such  Obligor for each of the  periods  then ended
subject, in the case of the unaudited consolidated statements, to year-end audit
and adjustments. Except as disclosed in writing to the Agent and the Board prior
to the date of this Agreement, neither Obligor nor any of their Subsidiaries has
any material  contingent  liability or liability for taxes,  long-term  lease or
unusual  forward or long-term  commitment that is not reflected in the foregoing
consolidated financial statements or in the most recently delivered consolidated
financial  statements  delivered  pursuant to Section  5.1(i)(a)  or (ii) or the
notes  thereto  and  which in any  such  case is  material  in  relation  to the
business,  operations,  properties, assets or condition (financial or otherwise)

prospects of such Obligor.

     (b) Any projections and pro forma  financial  information  contained in the
Application and the projections and pro forma financial information delivered to

at the time made (or as of the Closing Date in the case of the  projections  and
pro forma financial  information delivered pursuant to Section 3.1(l)), it being
recognized  by the Board and the  Lenders  that  such  projections  as to future
events are not to be viewed as facts and that actual  results  during the period
or  periods  covered  by any such  projections  may  differ  from the  projected
results.

     (c) The  Obligors  and their  Subsidiaries  maintain  a system of  internal
accounting  controls  sufficient  to  provide  reasonable  assurances  that  (i)

accountability  for assets is compared  with the existing  assets at  reasonable
intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any differences.

     (d) After giving effect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the pledge of the Collateral  under the Security  Agreement,  the book
value of the assets of the Parent not  subject to any Lien (as  defined in the 9
5/8% Senior Notes Indenture,  and subject to the exceptions contained in Section

any of the matters  covered by the  representations  and warranties  made in the
Application;  provided, however, that with respect to clause (i) of this Section

Collateral  reflected  in the  Collateral  Value  Certificate  delivered  on the
Closing  Date.  Except  as  otherwise  permitted  by this  Agreement,  all  such
properties and assets are free and clear of Liens.

proceedings,   arbitrations  or  governmental  investigations  (whether  or  not
purportedly on behalf of either Obligor or any of its Subsidiaries) at law or in

of either Obligor,  threatened against or affecting either Obligor or any of its
Subsidiaries or any property of either Obligor or any of its Subsidiaries  that,
individually or in the aggregate,  if adversely determined,  could reasonably be
expected to have a Material  Adverse  Effect or which  challenges  the legality,
validity or binding  effect of, or restricts  any Obligor from  entering into or
performing  under,  any  Loan  Document  including,   without  limitation,  this
Agreement and the Security  Agreement nor does either  Obligor have knowledge of
any basis  for any  Person  to  institute  any such  action,  suit,  proceeding,
arbitration or  investigation.  Neither  Obligor nor any of its  Subsidiaries is
subject  to  or  in  default  with  respect  to  any  final  judgments,   writs,

     Section  4.8.  Payment of Taxes.  All federal  income tax returns and other
material tax returns and reports of each Obligor and its  Subsidiaries  required
to be filed by any of them have been  timely  filed (or timely  extensions  have
been obtained with respect thereto). All federal income taxes and material Taxes
imposed  upon  each  Obligor  and its  Subsidiaries  and upon  their  respective
properties,  assets, income, businesses and franchises which are due and payable
have been paid before any  penalty,  fine or interest  accrues  thereon,  or are
being  contested in good faith through  appropriate  proceedings and an adequate
reserve has been  established  by the  Obligors  and their  Subsidiaries  to the
extent  required by GAAP.  Except as  disclosed  in Schedule  4.8,  there are no

of its Subsidiaries.

     Section 4.9. Performance of Agreements; Material Agreements.

     (a)  Neither  Obligor  nor any of its  Subsidiaries  is in  default  in the
performance,  observance or fulfillment of (i) any of the material  obligations,
covenants  or   conditions   contained  in  any  of  its  material   Contractual
Obligations,  or (ii) of any other  obligation,  covenant or  condition  thereof
which could  reasonably be expected to have a Material  Adverse  Effect,  and no
condition  exists that,  with the giving of notice or the lapse of time or both,
would  constitute  such a default  after giving  effect to the Borrowing and the
application of the proceeds therefrom.

     (b)  Neither  Obligor  nor  any of its  Subsidiaries  is a  party  to or is
otherwise  subject to any  agreements  or  instruments  or any  charter or other
internal restrictions which, individually or in the aggregate,  could reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

     (c) Except as set forth on Schedule 4.9(c),  neither Obligor nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to or is otherwise subject to any material  agreement or
arrangement, including, but not limited to, agreements relating to Indebtedness,
lease  agreements  or  Guarantees,  that provide for early  payment,  additional
collateral  support,  changes  in  terms or  acceleration  of  maturity,  or the
creation of an  additional  financial  obligation,  as a result of any of (i) an


                                       54
<PAGE>

adverse   change  in  the  credit  rating  of  either  Obligor  or  any  of  its
Subsidiaries,  (ii) an adverse change in the financial  ratios,  earnings,  cash
flow or stock  price of  either  Obligor  or any of its  Subsidiaries,  or (iii)
changes in the value of underlying, linked or indexed assets.

     (d)  The  Concessions  listed  on  Schedule  4.9(d)  hereto  are all of the
concessionary  agreements or arrangements referred to in the Application and are
reasonably  expected  by Borrower  and the Parent to result in the  cost-savings
described in the Application. The Borrower has heretofore delivered to the Board
and the Agent true and correct copies or descriptions  of the Concessions  which
Concessions have not been amended,  supplemented or otherwise  modified prior to
the date  hereof  or the  Closing  Date.  After  giving  effect  to the Loan and
application of the proceeds  therefrom,  the  Concessions  are in full force and
effect and constitute the legal, valid and binding  obligations of the Obligors,
their Subsidiaries and the counter-parties thereto (as applicable),  enforceable
against each in accordance with their respective terms, except as may be limited
by bankruptcy,  insolvency,  reorganization,  moratorium, fraudulent transfer or
other similar laws relating to or affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights
generally, and by general principles of equity (regardless of whether considered
in a proceeding in equity or at law).

     Section  4.10.  Governmental  Regulation.  Neither  Obligor  nor any of its
Subsidiaries  is subject to regulation  under the Public Utility Holding Company
Act  of  1935,  the  Federal  Power  Act,  the  Interstate  Commerce  Act or the
Investment  Company Act of 1940 or under any other  federal or state  statute or
regulation  which may  limit  its  ability  to incur  Indebtedness  or which may
otherwise render all or any portion of the Obligations unenforceable.

     Section  4.11.  Securities  Activities.  Neither  Obligor  nor  any  of its
Subsidiaries  owns  or is  engaged  principally,  or as  one  of  its  important
activities, in the business of extending credit for the purpose of purchasing or
carrying  any  Margin  Stock,  nor  shall  any  proceeds  of the Loan be used to
purchase or carry Margin Stock or to extend credit to any Person for the purpose
of purchasing or carrying any Margin Stock in a manner that violates or causes a
violation  of  Regulations  T, U or X of the Board of  Governors  of the Federal
Reserve System or any other regulation of such Board.

     Section  4.12.  Employee  Benefit  Plans.  Each Plan has been  operated and
administered  in compliance with all applicable  requirements of ERISA,  and, if
intended to qualify under Section 401(a) or 403(a) of the Internal Revenue Code,
in compliance with all applicable requirements of such provisions,  except where
the  failure  to do so could not  reasonably  be  expected  to have,  taking all
instances in the aggregate,  a Material Adverse Effect.  Neither Obligor nor any
ERISA Affiliate has any contingent liability with respect to any post-retirement
benefits under a welfare benefit plan as defined in ERISA other than a liability
for continuation  coverage described in Part 6 of Title I of ERISA, except where
such liability could not reasonably be expected to have, taking all instances in
the  aggregate,  a  Material  Adverse  Effect.  Neither  Obligor  nor any  ERISA
Affiliate  has  maintained,  contributed  to or been  obligated  to  maintain or
contribute to, or has any actual or contingent liability under any Multiemployer
Plan or any Plan that is subject to Title IV of ERISA.

Laws except for any noncompliance which, individually or in the aggregate, could
not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

     (b)  There is no,  and has been no,  condition,  occurrence,  or  Hazardous
Materials  Activity arising (a) at any Facilities or, to the knowledge of either
Obligor,  at any other  location or (b) in  connection  with the  operations  of
either Obligor or its Subsidiaries  (including the  transportation  of Hazardous
Materials  in  accordance  with  applicable   regulations),   which   condition,
occurrence or Hazardous  Materials Activity could reasonably be expected to form
the  basis  of an  Environmental  Claim  against  either  Obligor  or any of its
Subsidiaries  and which,  individually or in the aggregate,  could reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

     (c) There are no  pending  or, to either  Obligor's  knowledge,  threatened
Environmental  Claims against either  Obligor or its  Subsidiaries,  and neither
Obligor nor its Subsidiaries  have received any written notices,  inquiries,  or
requests  for  information  with  respect to any  Environmental  Claims which if
adversely  determined  could,  individually  or in the aggregate,  reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

     (d) Except as disclosed to the Agent,  the Board,  the Participants and the
Lenders in writing on or prior to the Closing Date,  neither  Obligor nor any of
its  Subsidiaries  is currently  operating or required to be operating under any
compliance order,  schedule,  decree or agreement,  any consent decree, order or
agreement,  and/or any corrective  action decree,  order or agreement  issued or
entered  into under any  Environmental  Law,  the  failure to comply  with which
could,  individually  or in the  aggregate,  reasonably  be  expected  to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

application of the proceeds therefrom,  each Obligor is and, upon the incurrence
of any Obligations by the Borrower on any date on which this  representation  is
made or deemed made, will be, Solvent.

     Section  4.15.  Disclosure.  No  representation  or warranty of any Obligor
contained in this Agreement,  any other Loan Document, the Application or in any
other  document,   certificate  or  written  statement,  or  any  other  written
information,  furnished to the Board, the Agent, the Lenders or the Participants
by or on  behalf  of  either  Obligor  or  any of its  Subsidiaries  for  use in
connection with the negotiation and closing of the transactions  contemplated by
this  Agreement  contains any untrue  statement of a material  fact or omits any
information necessary to make the statements therein not materially  misleading,
in  each  case,  as and  when  made or  furnished,  or in the  case of any  such
representations and warranties,  as any of them may be made from time to time in
accordance with this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.  There are no facts
known to any  Responsible  Officer of either  Obligor  (other than  matters of a
general  economic  nature)  that,  individually  or  in  the  aggregate,   could
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

orders  binding on or applicable to such Obligor,  its  Subsidiaries  and all of
their respective properties, except to the extent failure so to comply could not
(either  individually  or in the  aggregate)  reasonably  be  expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

     Section 4.17. Indebtedness; Off Balance Sheet Transactions.


     (a) Schedule 4.17 correctly sets forth the consolidated Indebtedness of the
Obligors and their Subsidiaries as of September 30, 2002.

     (b) Other than as disclosed in the Parent's or Borrower's  filings with the
SEC with reasonable  sufficiency and specificity (as contemplated in SEC Release
No. 33-8056  (January 22, 2002)),  there are no  transactions,  arrangements  or
other relationships between and/or among the Parent or any of its Affiliates (as

necessary repairs, renewals, replacements, betterments and improvements thereto,
all as in the  judgment of the  Obligors  may be  necessary so that the business
carried on in connection therewith may be properly and advantageously  conducted
at all times; provided,  however, that nothing in this Section shall prevent the
Borrower or any of their  Subsidiaries  from  discontinuing  the  operation  and
maintenance of any such properties if such  discontinuance is, in the good faith
judgment of the Obligors,  desirable in the conduct of their  business and could
not  reasonably be expected to have a Material  Adverse  Effect,  but subject in
each case to all applicable provisions of the Security Documents.

     (b) The Obligors will insure and keep insured, and will cause each of their

and operations,  in such amounts,  with such deductibles and covering such risks
as are insured against (including,  but not limited to, war risk and third party

practice by major U.S.  commercial  air  carriers  similarly  situated  with the

including  their financial and accounting  records,  and to make copies and take
extracts therefrom, and to discuss their affairs, finances and accounts with its
and  their  officers  and  independent  public  accountants,  at the  Borrower's
expense,  during  normal  business  hours  and as  often  as  may be  reasonably
requested;  provided,  that so long as no Default or Event of Default shall have

                                       66
<PAGE>

occurred and be continuing,  such inspection shall be upon reasonable notice and
at reasonable times, and shall not be disruptive to the business of the Obligors
and their Subsidiaries, as reasonably determined by the Borrower.

     Section 5.6.  Compliance  With Laws, Etc. The Obligors will, and will cause
each of  their  Subsidiaries  to,  comply  in all  material  respects  with  all

department,   commission,   board,  regulatory  authority,  bureau,  agency  and
instrumentality of the foregoing,  in respect of the conduct of their respective
businesses and the ownership of their respective properties,  except such as are
being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings. The Borrower shall not
conduct  any  Hazardous  Materials  Activity  at any  Facility  or at any  other
location in a manner that does not materially  comply with  Environmental  Laws.

     Section 5.7. Hazardous Materials.


     (a) To the extent the following are required by Environmental Laws, each of
the Borrower and the Parent will  conduct any and all  investigations,  studies,
sampling and testing and will take, and will cause each of its  Subsidiaries  to
take,  any and all necessary  remedial  action in connection  with the presence,
storage, use, disposal, transportation or Release of any Hazardous Materials for

                                       67
<PAGE>

which the Borrower is, or could be,  liable.  The foregoing  shall not apply if,
and  only  to  the  extent  that  (i)  the  Borrower's,  the  Parent's  or  such
Subsidiary's liability for such presence, storage, use, disposal, transportation
or Release of any  Hazardous  Materials is being  contested in good faith and by
appropriate proceedings diligently conducted by the Borrower, the Parent or such
Subsidiary,  (ii) such remedial action is taken by other Persons responsible for
such remedial action through an indemnification of the Borrower or the Parent or
(iii) such non-compliance  would not in any case or in the aggregate  reasonably
be expected to have a Material  Adverse Effect.  In the event the Borrower,  the
Parent or any of their Subsidiaries  undertakes any such  investigation,  study,
sampling,  testing or remedial  action with respect to any Hazardous  Materials,
the  Borrower,  the Parent or such  Subsidiary  will conduct and  complete  such
action in compliance with all applicable  Environmental  Laws, and in accordance
with the  policies,  orders  and  directives  of all  federal,  state  and local
Governmental Authorities except for such non-compliance as would not in any case
or in the aggregate reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

     (b) At the request of the Requisite Lenders or the Board from time to time,
the  Borrower  will  provide to the  Lenders  within  sixty (60) days after such
request, at the expense of the Borrower, an environmental site assessment report
for any of its, the Parent's or their Subsidiaries' properties described in such
request,  prepared by an environmental  consulting firm reasonably acceptable to
the Agent,  indicating  the presence or absence of Hazardous  Materials  and the
estimated cost of any compliance,  removal or remedial action in connection with
any Hazardous  Materials on such properties;  without limiting the generality of
the foregoing,  if the Agent  determines at any time that a material risk exists
that any such report will not be  provided  in the time  referred to above,  the
Agent may retain an environmental  consulting firm to prepare such report at the
expense of the  Borrower,  and each of the Obligors  hereby grants and agrees to
cause any Subsidiary that owns property  described in such a request to grant at
the time of such request to the Agent, the Lenders, the Board, such firm and any
agents or representatives thereof an irrevocable  non-exclusive license, subject
to the rights of tenants, to enter into their respective properties to undertake
such an assessment.

best efforts to cause the "Vendor  Concessions"  described on Schedule 4.9(d) to
be documented in written agreements promptly and in any event within thirty (30)
days  following  the Closing  Date,  and shall  deliver  copies of such  written
agreements to the Board.

     Section 5.9.  Employee Benefit Plans.  The Obligors and their  Subsidiaries
shall take such actions as are  reasonably  practicable to ensure that the Plans
with respect to which they may have any  liability  are  operated in  compliance
with all  applicable  laws  except to the extent that the failure to do so could
not reasonably be expected to have a Material  Adverse  Effect.  Neither Obligor
nor any of their  Subsidiaries  shall amend,  adopt or terminate any Plan unless
such action would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

     Section  5.10.  FAA Matters;  Citizenship.  The Borrower  will at all times
hereunder  be an  "air  carrier"  within  the  meaning  of the  Act  and  hold a
certificate under 49 U.S.C. Section 41102(a)(1) as currently in effect or as may
be amended or recodified  from time to time. The Borrower and each Subsidiary of
either  Obligor  engaged in  operations  as an "air  carrier"  will at all times
hereunder  be  a  United  States  Citizen  holding  an  air  carrier   operating
certificate  issued pursuant to Chapter 447 of Title 49 for aircraft  capable of
carrying 10 or more  individuals or 6,000 pounds or more of cargo.  Each Obligor
and each of their Subsidiaries will possess and maintain all necessary consents,
franchises,  licenses,  permits,  rights and  concessions and consents which are
material  to the  operation  of the  routes  flown by it and the  conduct of its
business and operations from time to time.

of its  obligations  under the Act and the  Regulations  as the Board,  the Loan
Administrator or the Agent may request.

is defined in 31 C.F.R. Section 19.110, as amended or modified from time to time
and not excepted  therefrom by 31 C.F.R.  Section  19.200(c))  in respect of the

as amended or modified from time to time) is not presently debarred,  suspended,
proposed for  debarment,  declared  ineligible,  or  voluntarily  excluded  from
participation  in such  transaction by any Federal  department or agency,  or an
explanation  why such  Person is unable to so  certify.  Further,  the  Borrower
agrees that it will not enter into a  "lower-tier  covered  transaction"  with a
Person who has been proposed for debarment under 48 C.F.R. Section 9.4, debarred
or  suspended  unless  granted  an  exception  for  such   "lower-tier   covered
transaction" pursuant to 31 C.F.R. Section 19.215.

the United States Comptroller  General.  To the extent requested by the Board or

the last day of each Fiscal Year beginning December 31, 2003, (ii) the date upon
which any additional property or assets that constitutes Appraised Collateral is
pledged as Collateral to the  Collateral  Agent to secure the  Obligations,  but
only with  respect to such  additional  Collateral  and (iii) a date which is no
later  than 60 days  after  the  Board (or if the  Board  Guarantee  shall  have
terminated,  the Requisite  Lenders) has requested that the Borrowers  obtain an
Appraisal Report; provided,  however, that the Borrower shall not be required to
obtain an Appraisal Report,  other than (x) pursuant to subsections (i) and (ii)
hereof,  or (y) if requested  by the Board under  clause (iii) hereof  following
delivery of a Collateral Value  Certificate that discloses that the value of the
Collateral  has or may have been, or may be materially  and adversely  affected,
more than once per Fiscal Year (it being  understood that the obligation  herein
of the Borrower to periodically obtain Appraisal Reports shall be in addition to
any rights or obligations under the Security Agreement).  Such Appraisal Reports
may be based on desktop  appraisals  unless the Board (or if the Board Guarantee
shall have  terminated,  the Requisite  Lenders)  shall have  requested  that an
Appraisal Report be based on physical inspection.

                                       69
<PAGE>

     (b) The Borrower shall maintain the value of the Collateral. In furtherance
thereof,  if at any  time  after  December  31,  2002  (x)  the  then  aggregate
Collateral  Value  shall be less than (y) an amount  equal to (i) the  aggregate
Collateral  Value as of September 30, 2002 (as reflected in the Collateral Value
Certificate  delivered  pursuant  to  Section  5.1(b)(xix)(A)),   less  (ii)  an
aggregate amount equal to the amounts  previously  prepaid from Excess Cash Flow
pursuant to this  paragraph  and  amounts  prepaid  pursuant to Section  2.6(c),
including with respect to assets  constituting  Collateral (any difference under
clause (A) and/or the difference between (x) and (y), the "Value Differential"),
the Obligors  shall  promptly do one of the following to the extent (but only to
the extent) necessary to eliminate such Value Differential:  (i) prepay the Loan
from the Parent's  Excess Cash Flow for the fiscal quarter during which or as of
the end of which the Value  Differential is established,  in accordance with the
provisions of Section 2.5 hereof,  (ii) pledge pursuant to a Security  Agreement
Supplement  delivered  to the  Collateral  Agent,  and  subject to the terms and
conditions of the Security Agreement,  additional Eligible Collateral  available
to be pledged to the Collateral  Agent,  or (iii) prepay the Loan as provided in
clause  (i)  above  and  pledge  pursuant  to a  Security  Agreement  Supplement
delivered to the  Collateral  Agent,  and subject to the terms and conditions of
the Security Agreement,  additional Eligible Collateral;  provided,  that if the
Parent's  Excess Cash Flow for such fiscal  quarter,  together with all Eligible
Collateral  that is  available  to be  pledged  to the  Collateral  Agent is not
sufficient to eliminate such Value Differential,  the Obligors shall continue to
prepay the Loan from the Parent's  Excess Cash Flow for each  subsequent  fiscal
quarter and pledge all additional  Eligible  Collateral as it becomes  available
until the Value  Differential no longer exists (it being  understood that assets
subject to a Lien permitted under Section 6.1 other than a Permitted Encumbrance
are not available to be pledged to the Collateral Agent), and provided, further,
that if any  cash  which  is used to  purchase  Aircraft  Related  Equipment  is
deducted from  Consolidated  EBITDAR in computing the amount of Excess Cash Flow
for any  fiscal  quarter  during  the  existence  of a Value  Differential,  the
Aircraft  Related  Equipment  purchased  with such cash  shall be pledged to the
Collateral Agent pursuant to clause (ii) above.

     (c) If additional  Eligible  Collateral is being pledged in accordance with
Section 5.14(b),  such additional Eligible Collateral shall be free and clear of
any Liens and the Borrower shall execute and deliver to the Collateral Agent the

     Section 7.2. Remedies.  During the continuance of any Event of Default, the
Agent shall, solely at the request of the Board or, if the Board Guarantee is no
longer  in full  force  and  effect,  the  Requisite  Lenders,  by notice to the
Borrower,  declare the Loan,  all  interest  thereon  and all other  amounts and
Obligations  payable  under this  Agreement to be  immediately  due and payable,
whereupon the Loan, all such interest and all such amounts and Obligations shall
become and be immediately due and payable, without presentment,  demand, protest
or further notice of any kind, all of which are hereby  expressly  waived by the
Borrower;  provided,  however,  that upon the occurrence of the Event of Default
specified in Section 7.1(f) or 7.1(g),  the Loan, all such interest and all such
amounts and Obligations  shall  automatically  become and be immediately due and
payable, without presentment,  demand, protest or any notice of any kind, all of
which are  hereby  expressly  waived by the  Borrower.  For so long as the Board
Guarantee shall remain in effect, remedies exercisable by the Agent hereunder or
the Collateral Agent under the Security Agreement shall be exercised solely upon
instructions  received in writing by the Agent or the Collateral  Agent,  as the
case may be, from the Board or, if the Board  Guarantee  is no longer in effect,
the Requisite Lenders. If an Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, the
Collateral  Agent  may upon  the  instructions  of the  Board,  or if the  Board
Guarantee is no longer in effect, the Requisite Lenders,  exercise any or all of
the rights and powers and pursue any and all of the  remedies  available  to the
Collateral  Agent under the Security  Agreement  and shall have and may upon the
written  request of the Board or, if the Board Guarantee is no longer in effect,
the  Requisite  Lenders,  exercise  any and all of the rights and  remedies of a
secured party under the Uniform  Commercial Code of any applicable  jurisdiction
and under any other applicable law.

     (c) With respect to the Loan Administrator's responsibilities under Section
8.1(b) above,  the Loan  Administrator  shall not be required to take any action
which exposes the Loan  Administrator  to liability or which is contrary to this
Agreement,  any other Loan Document,  the Board Guarantee or applicable law. The
execution  and delivery of this  Agreement by the Loan  Administrator  shall not
give  rise  to  any  implied  duties  or  fiduciary   obligations  of  the  Loan
Administrator  to any  Requesting  Party or any other  Person.  The Board hereby
acknowledges  and agrees that the failure of the Loan  Administrator  to perform
any of its obligations  hereunder  shall not invalidate or otherwise  affect the
Board Guarantee.

     (d) Except as permitted in subsection (b)(iv) above, the Loan Administrator
shall not be permitted to assign any of its  obligations  hereunder,  enter into
sub-servicing  agreements  or  otherwise  delegate  any of its duties under this
Agreement  without the prior written  consent of the  Requisite  Lenders and the
Board. The Loan Administrator  hereby  acknowledges and agrees that the fees and
expenses  payable to any  sub-servicer  retained by it in  accordance  with this
Agreement  shall be paid out of the fees  payable  by the  Borrower  to the Loan
Administrator under Section 2.8(g).

     (e) The Loan  Administrator may retain legal counsel (including counsel for
the Loan  Administrator),  independent  public  accountants and other experts or
advisers as desirable to provide the services set forth in Section  8.1(b),  and
shall be reimbursed by the Borrower for the reasonable associated costs and such
other  reasonable  expenses as the Loan  Administrator  shall incur in providing
such services.  The Borrower  shall be  responsible  for such costs and expenses
with respect to the services set forth in Section  8.1(b)(vii) and (viii) hereof
(calculated in the manner set forth in Section  2.8(g)),  and a Requesting Party
shall be responsible for the costs and expenses with respect to the services set
forth in Section  8.1(b)(ix),  (xiv) and (xv) if  requested  by such  Requesting
Party (calculated in the manner set forth in Section 2.8(g)).

     (f) In the event that any of the  Lenders,  the  Participants  or the Board
shall  request that the Loan  Administrator  provide  additional  services to it
under Section  8.1(b)(xiv) and (xv) or which are otherwise  outside the scope of
the  services  to be  provided  by the Loan  Administrator  hereunder,  the Loan
Administrator shall, to the extent it agrees to provide such additional services
to such party,  be entitled to charge such party such  additional  fees.  Unless
otherwise  agreed to by such  Person and the Loan  Administrator,  the terms and
conditions  of this  Article  VIII  shall  apply  to the  provision  by the Loan
Administrator of such additional services to such party.

     Section 8.2. Loan Administrator's Reliance.

     (a) The Loan Administrator shall be entitled to rely upon any note, notice,
consent,  certificate,  affidavit, letter, telegram, teletype message, facsimile
transmission, statement, order or other document in good faith believed by it to
be genuine and  correct and to have been signed or sent by the proper  person or
persons and, in respect of legal matters,  upon the opinion of counsel  selected
by the Loan Administrator.

     (b)  Neither the Loan  Administrator  nor any of its  directors,  officers,
agents,  employees or its sub-servicer  shall be liable to any Lender, the Board
or any  Participant for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it or by such
directors,  officers,  agents  or  employees  under or in  connection  with this
Agreement  or any  other  Loan  Document,  except  for its or  their  own  gross
negligence or willful  misconduct.  Without  limitation of the generality of the
foregoing,  the  Loan  Administrator:   (i)  may  consult  with  legal  counsel,
independent public accountants and other experts selected by it and shall not be
liable to any  Lender,  any  Participant  or the Board for any  action  taken or
omitted  to be taken in good faith by it in  accordance  with the advice of such
experts;  (ii) except as provided in Section  8.1(b)  above,  shall not have any
duty to ascertain or to inquire as to the  performance  or  observance of any of
the terms,  covenants or  conditions of this  Agreement,  the Notes or any other
Loan  Document  on the part of the  Parent or the  Borrower  or to  inspect  the
property (including the books and records) of the Parent, the Borrower or any of
their  Subsidiaries;  (iii) except as otherwise  provided in this Article  VIII,
shall not be responsible to any Lender, any Participant or the Board for the due
execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value
of this Agreement, the Notes or any other Loan Document, or any other instrument
or document furnished pursuant thereto;  and (iv) shall incur no liability under
or in respect to this Agreement,  the Notes or any other Loan Document by acting
upon any notice, consent,  certificate or other instrument or writing (which may
be by telegram,  facsimile transmission,  cable or telex) in good faith believed
by it to be genuine and signed or sent by the proper party or parties.

     (c) IN NO EVENT  SHALL THE LOAN  ADMINISTRATOR,  ITS  EMPLOYEES,  OFFICERS,
DIRECTORS,  AGENTS OR ITS  SUB-SERVICER  BE LIABLE FOR  CONSEQUENTIAL,  SPECIAL,
INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,  PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR LOSSES
(INCLUDING,  WITHOUT  LIMITATION,  LOST  PROFITS  AND  OPPORTUNITY  COSTS).  THE
LENDERS,  THE PARTICIPANTS AND THE BOARD AGREE THAT THE LOAN ADMINISTRATOR,  ITS
EMPLOYEES,  OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, AGENTS AND ITS SUB-SERVICER SHALL NOT BE LIABLE
TO THE LENDERS, THE PARTICIPANTS AND THE BOARD FOR ANY ACTIONS, DAMAGES, CLAIMS,
LIABILITIES,  COSTS, EXPENSES OR LOSSES IN ANY WAY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THE PERFORMANCE OR NONPERFORMANCE OF SERVICES  HEREUNDER OR UNDER ANY OTHER LOAN
DOCUMENT FOR AN AGGREGATE AMOUNT IN EXCESS OF THE FEES PAID BY THE LENDERS,  THE
PARTICIPANTS AND THE BOARD TO THE LOAN  ADMINISTRATOR IN PERFORMING THE SERVICES
DESCRIBED HEREIN.  NO TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT,  OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT SHALL
BENEFIT  OR CREATE ANY RIGHT OR CAUSE OF ACTION IN OR ON BEHALF OF ANY PERSON OR
ENTITY OTHER THAN THE LENDERS, THE PARTICIPANTS AND THE BOARD. THE PROVISIONS OF
THIS SUBSECTION  SHALL APPLY  REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION,  DAMAGE,  CLAIM,
LIABILITY,   COST,  EXPENSE,  OR  LOSS,  WHETHER  IN  CONTRACT,   STATUTE,  TORT
(INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, NEGLIGENCE), OR OTHERWISE.

     Section 8.3. Indemnification.  The Borrower, the Parent and each Requesting
Party (other than the Board) agrees to indemnify the Loan  Administrator and its
directors, officers, employees, advisors,  sub-servicer and representatives from
and against any and all costs, losses, liabilities,  claims, damages or expenses
(excluding  Taxes)  which may be incurred by or asserted or awarded  against the
Loan  Administrator  in any  way  relating  to or  arising  out of the  services
provided  by the Loan  Administrator  on  behalf of and at the  request  of such
Requesting  Party in  connection  with this  Agreement  or any  action  taken or
omitted  by the Loan  Administrator  under  this  Agreement  or any  other  Loan
Document  or both on  behalf of and at the  request  of such  Requesting  Party;
provided,  that none of the Borrower,  the Parent,  any Requesting  Party or the
Govco  Administrative Agent shall be liable for any portion of such liabilities,
obligations,  losses,  damages,  penalties,  actions,  judgments,  suits, costs,
expenses  or  disbursements   resulting  from  the  Loan  Administrator's  gross
negligence or willful  misconduct.  Without limitation of the foregoing,  and to
the  extent  that the  Loan  Administrator  is not  reimbursed  therefor  by the
Borrower  under any Loan  Document,  any  Requesting  Party  requesting the Loan
Administrator to take any action hereunder on its behalf agrees to reimburse the
Loan Administrator  promptly upon demand (but in all events within 30 days after
written  request)  for any and all  fees of the Loan  Administrator,  reasonable
out-of-pocket  costs and expenses  (including counsel fees) incurred by the Loan
Administrator  in connection  with the  performance  of the  requested  services
requested  by such  Requesting  Party  hereunder  and under the Loan  Documents.
Except as provided in the  preceding  sentence  regarding  reimbursement,  in no
event shall the Board be obligated to indemnify the Loan Administrator or any of
its directors, officers, employees, advisors, representatives or any other party
under any circumstances.

     Section 8.4.  Successor  Loan  Administrator.  The Loan  Administrator  may
resign at any time by giving 30 days prior written  notice thereof to the Agent,
the Lenders,  the Participants and the Board and may be removed at any time with
or without cause by the Requisite Lenders and the Board; provided, however, that
the  Loan  Administrator  shall  continue  to  perform  all  Loan  Administrator
functions  hereunder  until a  successor  Loan  Administrator  shall  have  been
appointed.  Upon any such  resignation or removal,  the Requisite  Lenders shall
have  the  right  to  appoint  a  successor  Loan   Administrator,   subject  to
confirmation  by the  Board.  If no  successor  Loan  Administrator  shall  have
accepted   such   appointment   within   120  days  after  the   retiring   Loan
Administrator's  giving of  notice of  resignation  or the  removal  of the Loan
Administrator, the Loan Administrator may appoint a successor Loan Administrator
who shall be willing to accept  such  appointment.  Upon the  acceptance  of any
appointment as Loan Administrator  hereunder by a successor Loan  Administrator,
such successor Loan  Administrator  shall thereupon succeed to and become vested
with all the rights,  powers,  privileges  and duties of the retiring or removed
Loan  Administrator,  and the  retiring or removed Loan  Administrator  shall be
discharged  from its duties and  obligations  as Loan  Administrator  under this
Agreement.  After any Loan  Administrator's  resignation or removal hereunder as
Loan  Administrator  the  provisions  of this  Article  VIII shall  inure to its
benefit as to any  actions  taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Loan
Administrator under this Agreement.

     Section 8.5. Conflict of Interest.

     (a) The  parties  hereto  acknowledge  and agree  that (i) in  addition  to
serving as Loan Administrator  under this Agreement,  the Loan Administrator may
at any time and from time to time service, manage or enter into other commercial
arrangements with respect to other property,  loans and assets of the Agent, any
Lender or any participant (each a "Loan  Administrator  Relationship");  (ii) in
the course of  conducting  such  activities or the services to be provided by it
hereunder,  or both, the Loan Administrator may from time to time have conflicts
of  interest  by  virtue  of a Loan  Administrator  Relationship;  and (iii) the
parties hereto expressly recognize that such conflicts of interest may arise, do
hereby waive such conflicts and agree that when such conflicts of interest arise
the Loan Administrator shall perform the services to be provided by it hereunder
in a professional,  diligent and workmanlike fashion. The parties hereto and the
Participants  further acknowledge and agree that the Loan Administrator,  in its
capacity  as Loan  Administrator,  is not acting as an  Affiliate  of any of the
parties  hereto,  and the  performance of the Loan  Administrator's  obligations
hereunder  shall not affect any right or remedy  which the Agent,  any Lender or
any participant may have under any Loan Document, any participation or the Board
Guarantee.  Each Requesting Party expressly  acknowledges and agrees that at all
times it shall take such action or omit to take such action  hereunder  based on
its own independent analysis of the relevant transaction and attendant facts and
circumstances.

     (b) Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary,  if in connection
with the provision of services,  a conflict of interest shall exist that, in the
good  faith  opinion  of  the  Loan  Administrator,   requires  an  arm's-length
negotiation between the Loan Administrator, on the one hand, and any Person with
a Loan Administrator Relationship, on the other hand, and the Loan Administrator
believes it would not be appropriate for the Loan Administrator to act on behalf
of  the  Requesting  Party  in  connection  with  such  matter,  then  the  Loan
Administrator  shall  withdraw from acting as Loan  Administrator  in connection
with the matter  giving rise to such  conflict  of  interest  by giving  written
notice to the Requesting Party not more than ten (10) Business Days after it has
made such  determination.  In such event, the Requesting Party shall be entitled
to appoint an independent representative to act on its behalf and at its expense
for purposes of the matter  giving rise to such  conflict of  interest,  and the
Loan  Administrator  shall have no responsibility or liability to the Requesting
Party  with  respect  to such  matter.  During  the  period of such  independent
representative's  appointment,  the Loan Administrator shall continue to perform
its ordinary  functions as Loan Administrator to the extent that the performance
of the Loan  Administrator does not, in the reasonable opinion of the Requesting
Party,  directly or indirectly  affect the matter giving rise to the conflict of
interest.

     Section  8.6.  Representations,   Warranties  and  Covenants  of  the  Loan
Administrator.  The Loan Administrator hereby represents, warrants and covenants
with the Lenders and the Board as follows:

     (a) it is duly  incorporated  and  validly  existing  under the laws of its
jurisdiction of incorporation;

perform its obligations  under this Agreement,  and this Agreement has been duly

regulatory  body  or  other  Person  is  required  for  the  due  authorization,
execution, delivery or performance by it of this Agreement;

     (d)  this  Agreement  has  been  duly  executed  and  delivered  by it  and
constitutes  a legal and binding  obligation  of it,  enforceable  against it in
accordance with its terms, except as enforceability may be limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,  moratorium or other similar laws now or
hereinafter  in effect,  relating to the  enforcement  of  creditors'  rights in
general and except as such  enforceability  may be limited by general principles
of equity (whether considered in a proceeding at law or in equity);

     (e) the  execution,  delivery and  performance by it of this Agreement does
not violate any  provision  of any existing  law or  regulation  or any material
agreement  to which it is  subject  or to which it is a party or  result  in the
creation of any Lien;

     (f) it has all corporate power and governmental  licenses,  authorizations,
and consents and approvals  required to carry on its business as now  conducted,
except where the failure to have such licenses, authorizations, and consents and
approvals would not have a material adverse effect on its ability to perform its
duties under this Agreement; and

     (g) it will maintain and implement administrative and operating procedures,
and  keep  and  maintain  all  documents,  books,  computer  records  and  other
information  reasonably  necessary  or  advisable  for  the  performance  of the
services to be provided by it hereunder.

     Section 9.1. Authorization and Action. Each Lender and the Board (and, with
respect to clause (ii) only,  each  Participant)  hereby appoints and authorizes
(i) the Agent to take such action as  administrative  agent on its behalf and to
exercise  such  powers  under  this  Agreement,  the Notes  and the  other  Loan
Documents  as are  delegated  by such Lender and the Board to it as Agent by the

collateral  agent on its behalf and to exercise  such powers  under the Security
Agreement as are delegated by such Lender,  such Participant and the Board to it
as  Collateral  Agent by the terms hereof and thereof,  together,  in each case,
with  such  powers  as are  reasonably  incidental  thereto  (the  Agent and the
Collateral  Agent are referred to in this Article IX individually as a "Facility
Agent" and  collectively,  as the "Facility  Agents"),  and each Facility  Agent

                                       93
<PAGE>

hereby  accepts  such  authorization  and  appointment.  As to any  matters  not
expressly  provided for by this Agreement,  the Notes, the Security Agreement or
any other Loan Document or provided for with specific  reference to this Section
9.1  (including,  without  limitation,  enforcement or collection of the Notes),
neither  Facility Agent shall be required to exercise any discretion or take any
action,  but shall be  required  to act or to refrain  from acting (and shall be
fully protected in so acting or refraining from action) upon the instructions of
the Board or, if the Board Guarantee is no longer in full force and effect,  the
Requisite  Lenders  and such  instructions  shall be binding  upon all  Lenders;
provided,  however,  that neither  Facility  Agent shall be required to take any
action which  exposes such  Facility  Agent to liability or which is contrary to
this Agreement,  the Board Guarantee,  the Security Documents, any Participation
Agreement,  any Note or applicable  law. As to any provision of this  Agreement,
the  Security  Agreement  or any other Loan  Document  under which action may be
taken or approval  given by the  Requisite  Lenders or the Board or both, as the
case may be, the action taken or approval given by the Requisite  Lenders or the
Board  or both,  as the case may be,  shall  be  binding  upon all  Lenders  and
Participants  to the same  extent and with the same effect as if each Lender and
each  Participant had joined  therein.  Each Facility Agent shall be entitled to
rely upon any note, notice, consent,  certificate,  affidavit, letter, telegram,
teletype message,  facsimile transmission,  statement,  order, other document or
other instrument or writing believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have
been  signed or sent by the proper  person or persons  and,  in respect of legal
matters,  upon the opinion of counsel selected by such Facility Agent. The Agent
may deem and treat the payee of each Note as the owner  thereof for all purposes
hereof unless and until a written notice of the  assignment or transfer  thereof
shall have been filed with the Agent.  Any request,  authority or consent of any
Person  who at the time of making  such  request  or giving  such  authority  or
consent  is  the  holder  of a Note  shall  be  conclusive  and  binding  on any
subsequent  holder,  transferee or assignee of such Note. Subject to the proviso
contained in Section 9.7(b),  neither Facility Agent shall be required to expend
or risk any of its own funds or otherwise incur any financial or other liability
in the performance of any of its duties hereunder.

     Upon  any  delivery  of any  instructions  to the  Collateral  Agent by the
Requisite  Lenders  pursuant to this  Agreement,  the Agent shall certify to the
Collateral Agent that the Lenders  delivering such  instructions  constitute the
Requisite Lenders under this Agreement.

     Section 9.2. Facility Agents' Reliance, Etc. Neither Facility Agent nor any
of its directors,  officers,  agents or employees shall be liable to any Lender,
any  Participant,  the Loan  Administrator  or the Board for any action taken or
omitted to be taken by it or by such  directors,  officers,  agents or employees
under or in connection with this Agreement, any Note or any other Loan Document,
except for its or their own gross  negligence or willful  misconduct as actually
and  finally  determined  by a  final,  non-appealable  judgment  of a court  of
competent  jurisdiction and only to the extent of direct (as opposed to special,
indirect,   consequential  or  punitive)  damages.  Without  limitation  of  the
generality of the  foregoing,  each Facility  Agent:  (a) may consult with legal
counsel,  independent  public  accountants and other experts  selected by it and
shall not be liable to any Lender,  any Participant,  the Loan  Administrator or
the Board for any  action  taken or  omitted  to be taken in good faith by it in

                                       94
<PAGE>

accordance  with  the  advice  of  such  experts;   (b)  makes  no  warranty  or
representation to any Lender, any Participant, the Loan Administrator or, except
as  expressly  provided  in the  Board  Guarantee,  the  Board  and shall not be
responsible to any Lender, any Participant, the Loan Administrator or, except as
expressly  provided  in the  Board  Guarantee,  the  Board  for any  statements,
warranties or representations (whether oral or written) made in or in connection
with this Agreement, any Note or any other Loan Document; (c) shall not have any
duty,  and shall incur no liability for its failure,  to ascertain or to inquire
as to the performance or observance of any of the terms, covenants or conditions
of this Agreement, any Note or any other Loan Document on the part of the Parent
or the Borrower or to inspect the property  (including the books and records) of
the Parent, the Borrower or any of their respective Subsidiaries;  (d) shall not
be responsible to any Lender,  any  Participant,  the Loan  Administrator or the
Board for the due execution,  legality, validity,  enforceability,  genuineness,
sufficiency or value of this Agreement,  any Note or any other Loan Document, or
any other instrument or document furnished pursuant thereto;  (e) shall incur no
liability  under or in  respect  to this  Agreement,  any Note or any other Loan
Document  by acting  upon any note,  notice,  consent,  certificate,  affidavit,
letter, telegram, teletype message, facsimile transmission,  statement, order or
other instrument or writing (which may be by telegram,  facsimile  transmission,
cable or telex)  believed  by it to be genuine  and signed or sent by the proper
party or  parties;  and (f) may deem and treat each  Lender  which  makes a loan
hereunder as the holder of the indebtedness resulting therefrom for all purposes
hereof  until the Agent  receives  and  accepts  an  Assignment  and  Acceptance
Agreement entered into by such Lender, as assignor,  and an eligible assignee as
provided in Section 10.2 hereof.

     Section  9.3.  Facility  Agents  and  Affiliates.  If and so long as either
Facility  Agent shall remain a Lender,  such Facility  Agent shall have the same
rights and powers under this  Agreement as any other Lender and may exercise the
same rights and powers under this Agreement as any other Lender and may exercise
the same as  though  it were not a  Facility  Agent;  and the term  "Lender"  or
"Lenders" shall,  unless otherwise  expressly  indicated,  include such Facility
Agent in its individual  capacity.  Unrelated to its role as a Facility Agent as
set forth herein,  each Facility Agent and its  affiliates  may accept  deposits
from, lend money to, act as trustee under indentures of, and generally engage in
any kind of business with,  the Borrower,  the Parent,  any of their  respective
Subsidiaries  and any Person who may do business  with or own  securities of the
Borrower,  all as if it were not a Facility Agent hereunder and without any duty
to account therefor to the Lenders.

     Section 9.4.  Representations of the Lenders and of the Board. Each Lender,
each Participant,  the Loan  Administrator and the Board has actively engaged in
the  negotiation of all of the terms of this  Agreement.  The Board has met with
the  Borrower  and the  Parent  to  discuss  the  business,  affairs,  financial
condition and prospects of the Borrower.  Neither Facility Agent has any duty or
responsibility,  either  initially  or on a  continuing  basis,  to provide  any
Lender, any Participant,  the Loan Administrator or the Board with any credit or
other  information  with  respect  to  the  Borrower  whether  coming  into  its
possession  as of the date of this  Agreement or at any time  thereafter,  or to
notify any Lender,  any Participant,  the Loan Administrator or the Board of any
Event of Default  except as provided in Section 9.5 hereof.  This  Agreement and
all  instruments or documents  delivered in connection  with this Agreement have

                                       95
<PAGE>

been  reviewed  and  approved  by  each  Lender,  each  Participant,   the  Loan
Administrator and the Board and none of the Lenders, the Participants,  the Loan
Administrator nor the Board have relied on any Facility Agent as to any legal or
factual matter in connection  therewith or in connection  with the  transactions
contemplated thereunder.

     Section 9.5. Events of Default; Termination of Board Guarantee.

     (a) In the event of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default,  any
Lender,  any  Participant or the Board knowing of such event may (but shall have
no duty to), or the Borrower  pursuant to Section  5.1(b)(v) hereof shall,  give
the Agent  written  notice  specifying  such Event of Default or other event and
expressly stating that such notice is a "notice of default". The Agent shall not
be deemed to have  knowledge of such events  unless the Agent has received  such
notice,  or unless  the Event of  Default  consists  of a failure  of payment of
principal or interest on the Notes.  In the event that the Agent receives such a
notice of the  occurrence  of an Event of Default,  the Agent shall give written
notice thereof to the Collateral Agent, the Lenders, the Participants,  the Loan
Administrator  and the Board.  Each  Facility  Agent shall take such action with
respect to such Default or Event of Default as shall be  reasonably  directed in
writing by the Board or, if the Board  Guarantee  is no longer in full force and
effect,  the  Requisite  Lenders,  subject to the  provisions  of  Section  9.6;
provided,  however,  that,  unless  and until  such  Facility  Agent  shall have
received such  directions,  such Facility  Agent may (but shall not be obligated
to) take such action,  or refrain from taking such action,  with respect to such
Event of Default  as it shall deem  advisable  and in the best  interest  of the
Lenders and of the Board and shall incur no liability  for acting or  refraining
to act in such manner  except for such  Facility  Agent's  gross  negligence  or
willful  misconduct  as actually and finally  determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction and only to the extent of direct (as opposed to special,  indirect,
consequential or punitive) damages.

     (b) In the event the Agent  shall  receive any notice from the Board to the
effect that (i) the Board has the right to terminate the Board  Guarantee  under
Section 2.05 thereof,  (ii) any portion of the Board  Guarantee  has  terminated
under Section 2.04 thereof or otherwise,  or (iii) the Board Guarantee shall for
any reason  have  ceased to be in full force and effect or the Board  shall have
asserted that any of its obligations thereunder is invalid or unenforceable, the
Agent shall promptly give written notice thereof to the Collateral Agent and the
Lenders.  The Agent  shall not be deemed  to have  knowledge  of any such  event
unless the Agent has received such notice (except if any such event results from
the  failure  of the Agent to  perform  any of its  obligations  under the Board
Guarantee).

     Section  9.6.  Facility  Agents'  Right to  Indemnity.  Except  for  action
expressly  required of a Facility Agent hereunder without  instructions from any
Person,  each Facility Agent shall be fully  justified in failing or refusing to
take any action  hereunder  on behalf of any Lender or the Board unless it shall
first be  indemnified  to its  satisfaction  by such  Person  (or any  affiliate
thereof) or the Board,  as the case may be,  against any and all  liability  and
expense  which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or  continuing  to take
any such action.

                                       96
<PAGE>

     Section 9.7. Indemnification of Facility Agents.

     (a)  The  Lenders  (other  than  the  Primary  Tranche  A  Lender)  and the
Participants  hereby agree to indemnify each Facility Agent and all  affiliates,
directors,  officers,  employees,  advisors and representatives  thereof (to the
extent  not  reimbursed  by  the  Borrower),  ratably  in  accordance  with  the
Obligations  owed  thereto  as  most  recently  in  effect  prior  to  the  date
indemnification  is  sought,  from  and  against  any  and  all  costs,  losses,
liabilities, claims, damages or expenses which may be incurred by or asserted or
awarded  against  such  Facility  Agent in any way relating to or arising out of
this  Agreement,  the Notes or the other Loan  Documents  or any action taken or
omitted by such Facility Agent under this Agreement, the Notes or the other Loan
Documents;  provided,  that the Lenders and the Participants shall not be liable
for any portion of such liabilities,  obligations,  losses, damages,  penalties,
actions,  judgments,  suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from any
Facility Agent's gross negligence or willful  misconduct as actually and finally
determined  by  a  final,  non-appealable  judgment  of  a  court  of  competent
jurisdiction and only to the extent of direct (as opposed to special,  indirect,
consequential or punitive) damages.  Without  limitation of the foregoing,  each
Lender (other than the Primary Tranche A Lender) and each Participant  agrees to
reimburse  each Facility Agent promptly upon demand for its ratable share of any
out-of-pocket  expenses (including counsel fees) incurred by such Facility Agent
in connection with the administration, or enforcement of, or the preservation of
any rights under, this Agreement,  the Notes or the other Loan Documents, to the
extent  that such  Facility  Agent is not  reimbursed  for such  expenses by the
Borrower.

     (b) In addition,  in the event that the Board or the Requisite  Lenders (as
the case may be)  instructs the  Collateral  Agent to take any action under this
Agreement or the Security Documents which requires the payment or advancement of
funds in  connection  with  the  fulfillment  of its  obligations  hereunder  or
thereunder,  the Requisite Lenders or the Board (as the case may be) shall, upon
demand,  advance to the  Collateral  Agent the  necessary  funds to satisfy  the
Collateral Agent's obligations hereunder and thereunder and the Collateral Agent
shall have no  obligation,  and shall incur no  liability  for its  failure,  to
execute such  instruction(s)  prior to the  Collateral  Agent's  receipt of such
funds;  provided,  however, that prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default,
the Collateral  Agent shall not seek the  advancement of funds from the Board or
the Requisite  Lenders prior to the  performance of the requested  action if the
amount required to perform such action is less than $10,000.


     Section 9.8. Successor Facility Agents.

     (a) Each  Facility  Agent may resign at any time by giving  written  notice
thereof to the  Lenders,  the Board and the  Borrower  and may be removed at any
time with cause (or,  following the Board's  honoring of a demand for payment in
accordance with the Board Guarantee,  without cause) by the Board. Upon any such
resignation or removal, the Borrower shall have the right with the prior written
consent of the Board and the Requisite  Lenders to appoint a successor  Facility
Agent.  If no successor  Facility  Agent shall have  accepted  such  appointment
within  30 days  after  the  retiring  Facility  Agent's  giving  of  notice  of
resignation  or the Board's  removal of such Facility  Agent,  the Board and the

                                       97
<PAGE>

Requisite Lenders shall have the right to appoint a successor Facility Agent who
shall be  willing  to  accept  such  appointment.  In any event  such  successor
Facility Agent shall be a commercial bank organized under the laws of the United
States of America or of any State thereof and shall have a combined  capital and
surplus of at least $1,000,000,000.  Upon the acceptance of any appointment as a
Facility Agent hereunder by a successor  Facility Agent, such successor Facility
Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights,  powers,
privileges  and  duties of the  retiring  or  removed  Facility  Agent,  and the
retiring  or removed  Facility  Agent  shall be  discharged  from its duties and
obligations  as agent  under this  Agreement  or as  collateral  agent under the
Security  Agreement,  as the case may be. After any Facility Agent's resignation
or removal hereunder as a Facility Agent the provisions of this Article IX shall
inure to its benefit as to any actions  taken or omitted to be taken by it while
it was a Facility Agent under this Agreement or the Security  Agreement,  as the
case may be.

     (b) Any  corporation  into  which  either  Facility  Agent may be merged or
converted or with which it may be  consolidated,  or any  corporation  resulting
from any merger,  conversion or  consolidation  to which either  Facility  Agent
shall be a party,  or any  corporation  succeeding  to the  business  of  either
Facility  Agent,  provided that such  corporation is a commercial bank organized
under the laws of the United  States of America or any State  thereof  and has a
combined capital and surplus of at least $1,000,000,000,  shall be the successor
of such Facility  Agent  hereunder  without the execution or filing of any paper
with any  party  hereto  or any  further  act on the part of any of the  parties
hereto  except where an  instrument of transfer or assignment is required by law
to effect such succession.


     Section 9.9. Collateral Agent's Further Protections

     (a) Neither this  Agreement nor the Security  Agreement  shall be deemed to
give, either express or implied,  any legal or equitable right, remedy, or claim
to any other  entity or person  whatsoever  except as  provided  in Section  9.8
hereof with respect to the resignation of either Facility Agent.

     (b) If at any time the  Collateral  Agent is served  with any  judicial  or
administrative  order,  judgment,  decree,  writ or other  form of  judicial  or
administrative  process which in any way affects the  Collateral  (including but
not limited to orders of attachment or  garnishment  or other forms of levies or
injunctions or stays relating to the transfer of the Collateral), the Collateral
Agent is  authorized  to comply  therewith in any manner the  Collateral  Agent,
acting in a commercially  reasonable  manner or in accordance with the advice of
legal counsel of the Collateral Agent's own choosing deems  appropriate;  and if
the Collateral  Agent complies with any such judicial or  administrative  order,
judgment,  decree, writ or other form of judicial or administrative process, the
Collateral  Agent  shall not be liable  to any of the  parties  hereto or to any
other person or entity even though such order, judgment, decree, writ or process
may be  subsequently  modified or vacated or otherwise  determined  to have been
without  legal  force or  effect.  The  Collateral  Agent  shall have no duty to
solicit the Collateral.

                                       98
<PAGE>

     (c) In no event  shall the  Collateral  Agent be liable  (i) for  acting in
accordance with or relying upon any instruction,  notice, demand, certificate or
document  from the Board,  the Requisite  Lenders or the Borrower,  (ii) for the
acts or omissions of its nominees, correspondents,  designees, agents, subagents
or  subcustodians,  (iii) for the investment or reinvestment of any cash held by
it hereunder,  in each case in good faith,  in accordance with the terms hereof,
including  without  limitation any liability for any delays in the investment or
reinvestment  of the  Collateral,  or any loss of interest  incident to any such
delays and (iv) for any action taken or omitted or any loss or injury  resulting
from  its  actions  or its  performance  or lack of  performance  of its  duties
hereunder,  in  each  case,  in the  absence  of  gross  negligence  or  willful
misconduct on its part.

     (d) The  Collateral  Agent shall not incur any liability for not performing
any act or fulfilling any duty, obligation or responsibility hereunder by reason
of any occurrence  beyond the control of the Collateral Agent (including but not
limited to any act or  provision of any present or future law or  regulation  or
governmental authority,  any act of God, terrorism or war, or the unavailability
of the Federal  Reserve Bank wire or  facsimile  or other wire or  communication
facility).

     (e) The  Collateral  Agent shall not be  responsible in any respect for the
form,  execution,  validity,  value or  genuineness  of documents or  securities
deposited  hereunder,  or for any  description  therein,  or for  the  identity,
authority or rights of persons  executing or delivering or purporting to execute
or deliver any such document,  security or  endorsement.  The  Collateral  Agent
shall not be called  upon to advise  any party as to the  wisdom in  selling  or
retaining or taking or refraining from any action with respect to any securities
or other property deposited hereunder.

     (f) In the  event  of any  ambiguity  or  uncertainty  hereunder  or in any
notice,  instruction or other  communication  received by the  Collateral  Agent
hereunder, the Collateral Agent may, in its sole discretion, refrain from taking
any  action  other  than to retain  possession  of the  Collateral,  unless  the
Collateral Agent receives written  instructions,  signed by the Borrower and the
Board (or if the Board Guarantee is no longer in effect, the Requisite Lenders),
which eliminates such ambiguity or uncertainty.

     (g) The  Collateral  Agent  does not have any  interest  in the  Collateral
deposited  hereunder  but is serving as  Collateral  holder only and having only
possession  thereof.  The Borrower shall pay or reimburse the  Collateral  Agent
upon request for any transfer  taxes or other taxes  relating to the  Collateral
incurred in connection  with its duties as Collateral  Agent hereunder and shall
indemnify  and hold  harmless the  Collateral  Agent from any amounts that it is
obligated  to pay in the way of such  taxes.  Any  payments  of income  from any
Collateral  account shall be subject to  withholding  regulations  then in force
with respect to United  States taxes.  The Obligors will provide the  Collateral
Agent with  appropriate W-9 forms for tax I.D.,  number  certifications,  or W-8
forms for  non-resident  alien  certifications.  This  paragraph  shall  survive
notwithstanding  any termination of this Agreement or the Security  Agreement or
the resignation or removal of the Collateral Agent.

                                       99
<PAGE>

     (h)  Notwithstanding  anything  contained  herein to the contrary,  (i) the
Collateral Agent does not assume any  responsibility  and shall not be deemed to
have  assumed any  responsibility,  either  express or  implied,  to monitor the
compliance  by  the  Borrower  with  any  statement,  representation,  covenant,
agreement,  or  undertaking  provided for in the Loan  Documents,  including the
Security  Documents,  or to  monitor or verify the  accuracy  of any  statement,
representation,  covenant, agreement, or undertaking made by the Borrower in any
documents,  certificates,  or instruments  delivered by the Borrower pursuant to
the  terms  of  this  Agreement  or any  of the  Security  Documents,  (ii)  the
Collateral  Agent shall be authorized  to rely upon,  and to act or refrain from
acting, in accordance with the terms of the Security  Documents in reliance upon
any certificate or instrument submitted to it and certified by an officer of the
Borrower  in  circumstances  in  which  the  delivery  or  such  certificate  or
instrument  is  contemplated  by the  terms of this  Agreement  or the  Security
Documents,  (iii) the Collateral  Agent does not assume any  responsibility  and
shall  not be deemed to have  assumed  any  responsibility,  either  express  or
implied, to inspect any of the Collateral, to observe any maintenance or repairs
in respect  thereof,  or to pay any  expenses  incurred in  connection  with any
inspection  of the  Collateral  or  observation  of the  maintenance  or repairs
and(iv) the  Collateral  Agent may assume  without  inquiry,  and shall incur no
liability  with such  assumption,  that the Borrower has performed and fulfilled
its  obligations  under this  Agreement  and the  Collateral  Agent shall not be
charged with notice or knowledge of any Default or any Event of Default,  unless
written  notice  of any  such  event  is  received  by the  Collateral  Agent in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

     (i)  Notwithstanding  anything contained herein or in any of the other Loan
Documents to the contrary, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that (i) any
of  the  acknowledgements,  consents,  agreements  and  statements  made  by the
Collateral  Agent in respect of the  Collateral  in the  exercise  of its duties
under the Security Documents are being made as directed agent for, and on behalf
and at the request of, the Lenders and the Board and that such acknowledgements,
consents,  or agreements are being made without  independent  investigation  and
without  liability  as a  principal,  (ii) the  Collateral  Agent  shall have no
obligation,  and shall incur no liability for its failure,  to monitor or verify
the  filing  of  UCC  financing  statements  (or  amendments  thereto)  and  the
information  contained  therein and (iii) the  provisions of the Loan  Documents
which empower  and/or entitle the  Collateral  Agent to take action,  to refrain
from taking action,  or to request the taking or refraining  from taking action,
with  respect to the  Collateral  shall not  impose,  and shall not be deemed to
impose,  on the  Collateral  Agent an obligation to act  independently  from the
instructions  of the Lenders  and/or the Board or to monitor  the  contingencies
that may give rise to the exercise of such power or entitlement.

     Section 10.1. Amendments, Waivers, Etc.

     (a) No amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement

and with respect to any such amendment,  modification,  waiver or consent (i) so
long as the Board Guarantee is in full force and effect,  signed by the Board or

Lenders,  and then any such  waiver or consent  shall be  effective  only in the

notice to or demand on the  Obligors in any case shall  entitle the  Obligors to
any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances.

     (c) Notwithstanding  anything herein to the contrary, in the event that the
Obligors shall have requested  each of the Lenders,  in writing,  to agree to an
amendment,  modification,  waiver or  consent  with  respect  to any  particular
provision or provisions  hereof, and any such Lender shall have failed to state,
in writing,  that it either  agrees or disagrees  (in full or in part) with such
request (in the case of its  statement  of  agreement,  subject to  satisfactory
documentation  and such other  conditions it may specify) within 30 days of such
request,  then such Lender hereby  irrevocably  authorizes the Agent to agree or
disagree,  in full or in  part,  and in the  Agent's  sole  discretion,  to such
requests  on behalf  of such  Lender as such  Lender's  attorney-in-fact  and to
execute  and deliver any  writing  approved  by the Agent which  evidences  such
agreement as such Lender's duly authorized agent for such purposes.

     (d) In  connection  with any proposed  amendment,  modification,  waiver or
termination (a "Proposed Change") requiring the consent of all affected Lenders,
if the consent of the  Requisite  Lenders is obtained,  but the consent of other
Lenders whose consent is required is not obtained (any such Lender whose consent
is not  obtained  as  described  in this  Section  10.1 being  referred  to as a
"Non-Consenting  Lender"),  then,  so long as the  Lender  that is acting as the
Agent is not a Non-Consenting Lender, at the Borrower's request, the Agent or an
Eligible  Lender  that is  acceptable  to the Agent and the Board shall have the
right with the Agent's  consent and in the Agent's  sole  discretion  (but shall
have no  obligation)  to  purchase  from such  Non-Consenting  Lender,  and such
Non-Consenting  Lender agrees that it shall, upon the Agent's request,  sell and
assign to the Lender that is acting as the Agent or such Eligible Lender, all of
the portion of the Loan of such Non-Consenting Lender for an amount equal to the
principal balance of such portion of the Loan held by the Non-Consenting  Lender
and all accrued interest and fees with respect thereto through the date of sale,
such purchase and sale to be consummated  pursuant to an executed Assignment and
Acceptance.

     Section 10.2. Assignments and Participations.

     (a) Each Lender may sell, transfer,  negotiate or assign either in whole or
in part to one or more Eligible Lenders its rights and obligations hereunder and
under the Notes and the other Loan  Documents  without the prior  consent of the
Obligors but, except as otherwise provided in Section 10.2(d), with the consent,
not to be unreasonably withheld, of the Agent, and the prior written approval of
the Board (such  consent,  in the case of an  assignment  to an Affiliate of any
Lender that is an Eligible Lender, not to be unreasonably  withheld);  provided,
that (i) the assigning  Lender shall give prompt written notice to the Agent and
the  Board of the  terms of and the  parties  to any such  assignment,  (ii) the
proposed assignee shall provide to the Agent and the Board all documentation and
certificates  as  required  by the Agent and the Board to confirm to the Agent's
and the Board's  satisfaction that such proposed assignee is an Eligible Lender,
and (iii) the Borrower  will not be  obligated  to pay any greater  amount under
Section 2.10(c) or Section 2.12(a) (in respect of increased costs or Indemnified
Taxes  imposed  pursuant  to  applicable  law in  effect  on the  date  of  such
assignment)  to the assignee  than the Borrower is then  obligated to pay to the
assigning Lender under such Sections; provided, however, that the consent of the
Board shall not be required for any assignment  which occurs after the Board has
been  reimbursed in full for all payments under the Board Guarantee or the Board
Guarantee  shall have  terminated.  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing  the Primary
Tranche A Lender may assign its rights and  obligations  hereunder and under the
Tranche A Note to the  Alternate  Tranche A Lender  without the prior consent of
any party to this Agreement or any other Loan Document.


     Without  prejudice to any restrictions or limitations in the  Participation
Agreements or any other Loan Document,  each  Participant may sell,  transfer or
assign  either  in whole  or in part to one or more  Eligible  Participants  its
rights and obligations  hereunder and the other Loan Documents without the prior
consent of the Obligors but with the consent,  not to be unreasonably  withheld,
of the Agent, and the prior written approval of the Board (such consent,  in the
case of an  assignment  to an Affiliate of any  Participant  that is an Eligible
Participant, not to be unreasonably withheld);  provided, that (i) the assigning
Participant  shall give prompt  written notice to the Agent and the Board of the
terms of and the  parties to any such  assignment,  (ii) the  proposed  assignee
shall provide to the Agent and the Board all  documentation  and certificates as
required  by the Agent and the Board to confirm to the  Agent's  and the Board's
satisfaction that such proposed assignee is an Eligible  Participant,  and (iii)
the  Borrower  will not be obligated  to pay any greater  amount  under  Section
2.10(c) or Section 2.12(a) (in respect of increased  costs or Indemnified  Taxes
imposed  pursuant to applicable law in effect on the date of such assignment) to
the  assignee  than  the  Borrower  is then  obligated  to pay to the  assigning
Participant  under such  Sections;  provided,  however,  that the consent of the
Board shall not be required for any assignment  which occurs after the Board has
been  reimbursed in full for all payments under the Board Guarantee or the Board
Guarantee shall have terminated.

     (b) The parties to each assignment  shall execute and deliver to the Agent,
for  its  acceptance  and  recording,  an  Assignment  and  Acceptance,  and the
assignee,  if a Non-U.S.  Person, shall deliver to the Borrower and the Agent on
or prior to the date of the assignment,  two completed copies of either IRS Form


                                      103
<PAGE>

W-8BEN or W-8ECI or other applicable form,  certificate or document  required to
satisfy the  requirements  of Section 2.12.  Upon such  execution,  delivery and
acceptance  and the receipt by the Agent of an  assignment  fee in the amount of
$10,000  (except  that so long as Citibank,  N.A. is the Agent,  no fee shall be
payable in connection  with any assignment to any affiliate of Citibank,  N.A.),
the Agent shall record such  Assignment  and  Acceptance  and from and after the
effective  date  specified in such  Assignment  and  Acceptance (i) the assignee
thereunder of all or any portion of the Loan shall become a party hereto and, to
the  extent  that  rights and  obligations  under the Loan  Documents  have been
assigned to such assignee  pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance,  have the
rights and  obligations of a Lender and (ii) the assignor  thereunder  shall, to
the extent that rights and  obligations  under this Agreement have been assigned
by it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance,  relinquish its rights (except
those which survive the payment in full of the Obligations) and be released from
its obligations under the Loan Documents, other than those relating to events or
circumstances  occurring  prior  to  such  assignment  (and,  in the  case of an
Assignment and Acceptance  covering all or the remaining portion of an assigning
Lender's  rights and  obligations  under the Loan  Documents,  such Lender shall
cease to be a party hereto).

     (c) Upon  its  receipt  of an  Assignment  and  Acceptance  executed  by an
assigning  Lender and an  assignee,  the Agent  shall,  if such  Assignment  and
Acceptance has been completed,  (i) accept such Assignment and Acceptance,  (ii)
record the  information  contained  therein in the  Register,  (iii) give prompt
notice  thereof to the Borrower and (iv) give prompt written notice of the terms
of and parties to any such assignment to the Board.

     (d) In addition to the other  assignment  rights  provided in this  Section
10.2,  each Lender may assign,  without the prior consent of the  Obligors,  the
Agent or the Board,  as collateral  or  otherwise,  any of its rights under this
Agreement to any Federal  Reserve Bank  pursuant to  Regulation A of the Federal
Reserve Board,  provided,  however,  that no such  assignment  shall release the
assigning Lender from any of its obligations hereunder.

     (e) Each Lender may, without the prior consent of the Obligors or any other
Person,  sell  participations in addition to the  Participations,  to the extent
permitted by the  Regulations  and except as provided in Section  5.04(b) of the
Board  Guarantee,  in or to  all or a  portion  of its  rights  and  obligations
hereunder and under any Note and the other Loan  Documents;  provided,  that (i)
neither  any  Note  nor the  Board  Guarantee  is  assigned,  conveyed,  sold or
transferred in whole or in part in connection with any  participation,  (ii) the
Board's  ability to assert any and all defenses  available to it under the Board
Guarantee and the law is not adversely  affected and (iii) the Borrower will not
be obligated to pay any greater amount under Section  2.10(c) or Section 2.12(a)
(in  respect  of  increased  costs or  Indemnified  Taxes  imposed  pursuant  to
applicable law in effect on the date of such  participation) to such participant
than the  Borrower is then  obligated  to pay to any selling  Lender  under such
Sections. In the event of the sale of any participation by any Lender, except as
otherwise  expressly  provided herein,  (A) such Lender's  obligations under the
Loan  Documents  shall remain  unchanged,  (B) such Lender  shall remain  solely

                                      104
<PAGE>

responsible to the other parties for the  performance of such  obligations,  (C)
such Lender shall remain the holder of such Obligations for all purposes of this
Agreement, (D) the Agent, the Board and the other Lenders shall continue to deal
solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and
obligations  under this Agreement,  and (E) each holder of such a participation,
if a Non-U.S.  Person, shall deliver to the Borrower, the Agent and such Lender,
on or prior to the date of the sale of the  participation,  two completed copies
of either IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI or other  applicable  form,  certificate  or
document  required to satisfy the  requirements  of Section 2.12.  Any holder of
such a  participation  will be  entitled to the  benefits  of Sections  2.10(c),
2.10(f),  2.11 and 2.12 to the same  extent as if such Person were a Lender (but
subject to the restrictions of Section 2.12(i)).

     (f)  Without   prejudice  to  any   restrictions   or  limitations  in  the
Participation  Agreements  or any other Loan  Document,  each  Participant  may,
without  the  prior  consent  of the  Obligors,  the  Agent or the  Board,  sell
subparticipations  in respect of the Participations,  to the extent permitted by
the Regulations;  provided, that (i) neither any Note nor the Board Guarantee is
assigned,  conveyed,  sold or transferred in whole or in part in connection with
any  subparticipation,  (ii) the Board's  ability to assert any and all defenses
available to it under the Board Guarantee and the law is not adversely  affected
and (iii) the Borrower  will not be  obligated  to pay any greater  amount under
Section 2.10(c) or Section 2.12(a) (in respect of increased costs or Indemnified
Taxes  imposed  pursuant  to  applicable  law in  effect  on the  date  of  such
subparticipation)  to such subparticipant than the Borrower is then obligated to
pay to any selling Participant under such Sections.  In the event of the sale of
any subparticipation by any Participant,  except as otherwise expressly provided
herein, (A) such Participant's obligations under the Loan Documents shall remain
unchanged,  (B) such  Participant  shall remain solely  responsible to the other
parties for the  performance of such  obligations,  (C) such  Participant  shall
remain the  holder of the  applicable  Participation  for all  purposes  of this
Agreement,  (D) the Agent,  the Board and the  Lenders  shall  continue  to deal
solely and directly with such Participant in connection with such  Participant's
rights and  obligations  under  this  Agreement,  and (E) each  holder of such a
subparticipation, if a Non-U.S. Person, shall deliver to the Borrower, the Agent
and   such   Participant,   on  or  prior  to  the  date  of  the  sale  of  the
subparticipation,  two  completed  copies of either IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI or
other  applicable  form,   certificate  or  document  required  to  satisfy  the
requirements of Section 2.12.

     Section  10.3.  Costs  and  Expenses.   Whether  or  not  the  transactions
contemplated hereby shall be consummated, the Obligors agree to pay promptly (i)
all costs and expenses  incurred by the Loan  Administrator,  the Lenders,  each
Participant,  the  Collateral  Agent  and  the  Agent  in  connection  with  the
negotiation,  preparation,  execution  and delivery of the Loan  Documents,  the
Board  Guarantee and all documents  (including,  without  limitation,  documents
required to be delivered  after the Closing Date under any provision of the Loan
Documents,   including,  without  limitation,  under  Section  2(b)(ii)  of  the
Participation  Agreements)  relating  thereto  (including,  without  limitation,
reasonable legal fees and expenses), (ii) all costs and expenses incurred by the
Loan Administrator,  the Lenders, the Participants,  any other participant,  the
Collateral  Agent and the Agent in  connection  with any  consents,  amendments,
waivers or other modifications hereto or thereto (including, without limitation,

                                      105
<PAGE>

reasonable  legal fees and expenses),  (iii) all costs and expenses  incurred by
the Agent in connection  with the syndication of the Loan (if any), and (iv) all
costs and  expenses,  including,  without  limitation,  legal fees and  expenses
incurred  by  the  Agent,   the  Collateral   Agent,   the  Lenders,   the  Loan
Administrator,  each  Participant  and any other  participant  in enforcing  any
Obligations  of, or in collecting any payments due from, the Obligors  hereunder
or under the other Loan Documents  (including  without  limitation the costs and
expenses  contemplated  under  Section  4.02 of the  Security  Agreement)  or in
connection with the  administration,  or enforcement of, or the  preservation of
any rights under any Loan Document.

     Section 10.4.  Indemnities.  Whether or not the  transactions  contemplated
hereby shall be  consummated,  the Obligors  agree,  jointly and  severally,  to
defend,  indemnify,  pay and hold harmless the Board,  the Agent, the Collateral
Agent, the Lenders, the Participants,  the Govco Administrative  Agent, the Loan
Administrator and their respective Affiliates,  officers, directors,  employees,
agents and advisors (collectively called the "Indemnitees") from and against any
and  all  liabilities,   obligations,   losses,  damages,  penalties,   actions,
judgments,  suits,  claims,  costs,  expenses and  disbursements  of any kind or
nature  whatsoever   (including  without  limitation  the  reasonable  fees  and
disbursements of counsel for such  Indemnitees,  but excluding  Taxes),  whether
direct,  indirect or  consequential  and whether based on any federal,  state or
foreign laws,  statutes,  rules or  regulations  (including  without  limitation
securities and commercial laws,  statutes and rules or  regulations),  on common
law or  equitable  cause or on  contract or  otherwise,  that may be imposed on,
incurred by, or asserted against any such Indemnitee,  in any manner arising out
of this  Agreement,  the other Loan Documents or the  transactions  contemplated
hereby or thereby (including, without limitation, the use or intended use of the
proceeds of the Loan) or the syndication of the Loan or any statement  contained
in the  Application  or otherwise  made by or on behalf of either Obligor to the
Board or any breach or default by either  Obligor of any  provision  of the Loan
Documents  (collectively called the "Indemnified  Liabilities");  provided, that
neither  Obligor shall have any  obligation  to any  Indemnitee  hereunder  with
respect  to  any  Indemnified   Liabilities  to  the  extent  such   Indemnified
Liabilities  arise (i) from the gross  negligence or willful  misconduct of that
Indemnitee  (as  actually  and  finally  determined  by a final,  non-appealable
judgment  of a court of  competent  jurisdiction)  and only to the  extent  such
Indemnified  Liabilities  constitute  direct (as opposed to  special,  indirect,
consequential  or  punitive)  damages  or (ii)  constitute  ordinary  and  usual
operating or overhead expenses of an Indemnitee (excluding,  without limitation,
costs and expenses of any outside counsel,  consultant or agent).  To the extent
that the  undertaking to defend,  indemnify,  pay and hold harmless set forth in
the preceding  sentence may be unenforceable  because it is violative of any law
or public policy,  the Obligors shall  contribute the maximum  portion that they
are  permitted  to pay and  satisfy  under  applicable  law to the  payment  and
satisfaction of all Indemnified  Liabilities  incurred by the Indemnitees or any
of them. No Indemnitee shall have any liability (whether direct or indirect,  in
contract,  tort or otherwise) to either of the Obligors or any of their security
holders or creditors for or in  connection  with the  transactions  contemplated
hereby,  except  to  the  extent  such  liability  is  determined  by  a  final,
non-appealable  judgment of a court of competent  jurisdiction  to have resulted
primarily from such Indemnitee's gross negligence or willful  misconduct.  In no
event,  however,  shall any  Indemnitee be liable on any theory of liability for

                                      106
<PAGE>

any special,  indirect,  consequential or punitive damages  (including,  without
limitation, any loss of profits, business or anticipated savings).

     Section 10.5. Right of Set-off.

     (a) In addition to any rights now or hereafter granted under applicable law
and not by way of limitation of any such rights,  upon the occurrence and during
the continuance of any Event of Default, to the fullest extent permitted by law,
each  Lender is hereby  authorized  by the  Borrower at any time or from time to
time,  without  notice to the Borrower or to any other  Person,  any such notice
being hereby  expressly  waived,  to set off and to appropriate and to apply any
and  all  deposits  (general  or  special,   including,   but  not  limited  to,
Indebtedness evidenced by certificates of deposit, whether matured or unmatured)
and any other  Indebtedness  at any time held or owing by that  Lender to or for
the  credit  or the  account  of the  Borrower  against  and on  account  of the
obligations and liabilities of the Borrower to that Lender under this Agreement,
the Notes,  and the other Loan  Documents,  including,  but not  limited to, all
claims of any  nature  or  description  arising  out of or  connected  with this
Agreement, the Notes, or any other Loan Document, irrespective of whether or not
(i) that Lender shall have made any demand hereunder or (ii) the principal of or
the interest on the Loan or any other  amounts due  hereunder  shall have become
due and payable  pursuant  to Section  7.2 and  although  said  obligations  and
liabilities, or any of them, may be contingent or unmatured.

     (b) If any fees, expenses or costs incurred by, or any obligations owed to,
the  Collateral  Agent or its counsel  hereunder are not promptly paid when due,
the Collateral  Agent may reimburse itself therefor from any cash held by it and
may sell,  convey or  otherwise  dispose of any  securities  held by it for such
purpose.  The  Collateral  Agent may in its sole  discretion  withhold  from any
distribution of Collateral an amount of Collateral it believes would,  upon sale
or  liquidation,  produce  proceeds  equal to any  unpaid  amounts  to which the
Collateral Agent is entitled to hereunder.

     Section 10.6.  Sharing of Payments,  Etc. The Lenders and the  Participants
(collectively  the  "Recipients")  hereby agree among  themselves that if any of
them shall, whether by voluntary payment, by realization upon security,  through
the exercise of any right of set-off or banker's lien, by  counterclaim or cross
action or by the enforcement of any right under the Loan Documents or otherwise,
or as adequate  protection  of a deposit  treated as cash  collateral  under the
Bankruptcy  Code,  receive payment or reduction of a proportion of the aggregate
amount of principal, interest, fees and other amounts then due and owing to that
Recipient  hereunder  or under  the  other  Loan  Documents  (collectively,  the
"Aggregate  Amounts Due" to each Recipient) which is greater than the proportion
received by any other Recipient in respect of the Aggregate  Amounts Due to such
other  Recipient,  then the Recipient  receiving  such  proportionately  greater
payment  shall (i) notify the Agent and each other  Recipient  of the receipt of
such payment and (ii) apply a portion of such payment to purchase participations
(which it shall be deemed to have purchased from each seller of a  participation
simultaneously  upon the receipt by such seller of its portion of such  payment)
in the Aggregate Amounts Due to the other Recipients so that all such recoveries
of Aggregate  Amounts Due shall be shared by all Recipients in proportion to the
Aggregate  Amounts  Due  to  them;  provided,  that  if  all  or  part  of  such

                                      107
<PAGE>

proportionately  greater  payment  received  by  such  purchasing  Recipient  is
thereafter  recovered from such Recipient upon the bankruptcy or  reorganization
of either  Obligor or  otherwise,  those  purchases  shall be rescinded  and the
purchase  prices  paid  for  such  participations  shall  be  returned  to  such
purchasing  Recipient  ratably  to the  extent  of such  recovery,  but  without
interest.  The Obligors expressly consent to the foregoing arrangement and agree
that any holder of a participation  so purchased may exercise any and all rights
of banker's  lien,  set-off or  counterclaim  with respect to any and all monies
owing by the  Obligors to that holder with  respect  thereto as fully as if that
holder were owed the amount of the participation held by that holder.

     Section 10.7. Notices, Etc. Unless otherwise  specifically provided herein,
any notice,  request or other  communication  herein required or permitted to be
given shall be in writing and may be personally  served or sent by telefacsimile
or United States mail or courier  service and shall be deemed to have been given
when   delivered  in  person  or  by  courier   service,   or  upon  receipt  of
telefacsimile,  or five (5)  Business  Days  after  depositing  it in the United
States mail with postage prepaid and properly addressed;  provided, that notices
shall not be effective until received.  For the purposes hereof,  the address of
each party hereto and each Participant  shall be as set forth under such party's
name on Annex A, or (i) as to either of the Obligors  and the Agent,  such other
address as shall be designated by such Person in a written  notice  delivered to
the other  parties  hereto and (ii) as to each other  party  hereto,  such other
address as shall be  designated by such party in a written  notice  delivered to
the Agent.  A copy of any and all notices,  requests,  communications,  demands,
reports, documents or other materials (including, without limitation, any of the
materials  delivered by the Obligors under Section 5.1(b))  delivered or sent by
any party  pursuant to the terms of this  Agreement or any other Loan  Document,
shall be given to the Loan Administrator.

     Section 10.8. No Waiver; Remedies. No failure on the part of the Board, any
Lender,  the  Collateral  Agent  or the  Agent  to  exercise,  and no  delay  in
exercising, any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any
single or  partial  exercise  of any such  right  preclude  any other or further
exercise  thereof  or the  exercise  of any other  right.  The  remedies  herein
provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies provided by law.

     Section 10.9.  Independence of  Representations,  Warranties and Covenants.
All  representations  and warranties  made in and covenants under this Agreement
shall be given independent effect so that (a) if a particular representation and
warranty is unqualified,  the fact that another  representation  and warranty is
qualified shall not affect the operation of the former  provision;  and (b) if a
particular  action or condition is not permitted by any of such  covenants,  the
fact that it would be permitted by an exception to, or would otherwise be within
the limitations of, another  covenant shall not avoid the occurrence of an Event
of Default or Default if such action is taken or condition exists.

     Section 10.10. Governing Law. This Agreement and the rights and obligations
of the parties  hereto shall be governed by, and construed in  accordance  with,

                                      108
<PAGE>

the law of the State of New York; provided,  that in the event the Board becomes
a Lender  pursuant to the Board  Guarantee,  the rights and  obligations  of the
Board  hereunder  shall be governed by, and  construed in accordance  with,  the
Federal law of the United  States of America,  if and to the extent such Federal
law is applicable,  and otherwise in accordance with the law of the State of New
York.

     Section 10.11. Submission to Jurisdiction; Service of Process.

     (a) Any legal action or  proceeding  with respect to this  Agreement or any
other Loan  Document may be brought in the courts of the State of New York or of
the United  States of America for the  Southern  District  of New York,  and, by
execution and delivery of this  Agreement,  each of the Obligors  hereby accepts
for itself and in respect of its property,  generally and  unconditionally,  the
jurisdiction  of the aforesaid  courts.  The parties  hereto hereby  irrevocably
waive any objection,  including any objection to the laying of venue or based on
the grounds of forum non conveniens, which any of them may now or hereafter have
to  the  bringing  of  any  such  action  or  proceeding   in  such   respective
jurisdictions.

     (b) Each of the Obligors hereby irrevocably  consents to the service of any
and all legal  process,  summons,  notices and documents in any suit,  action or
proceeding  brought  in  the  United  States  of  America  arising  out of or in
connection with this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents by the mailing

such process to such Obligor in accordance  with the provisions of Section 10.7.
Each of the  Obligors  agrees  that a  final  judgment  in any  such  action  or
proceeding  shall be conclusive  and may be enforced in other  jurisdictions  by
suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law.

     (c) Nothing  contained in this Section  10.11 shall affect the right of the
Agent  or any  Lender  or  other  party to serve  process  in any  other  manner
permitted by law or commence  legal  proceedings  or otherwise  proceed  against
either Obligor in any other jurisdiction.

     Section 10.12. Waiver of Jury Trial. Each of the parties hereto irrevocably
waives trial by jury in any action or proceeding  with respect to this Agreement
or any other Loan Document.

     Section 10.13.  Marshaling;  Payments Set Aside.  Neither the Agent nor any
Lender  shall be under any  obligation  to  marshal  any  assets in favor of the
Obligors  or any  other  party or  against  or in  payment  of any or all of the
Obligations.  To the  extent  that  either of the  Obligors  make a  payment  or
payments to the Agent for the account of the Board, the Loan Administrator,  any
Lender or any Participant  (each, a "Payee") or any Payee receives  payment from
exercise of their rights of setoff, and such payment or payments or the proceeds
of such setoff or any part thereof are subsequently invalidated,  declared to be
fraudulent  or  preferential,  set aside or  required to be repaid to a trustee,
receiver  or any  other  party,  then (i) to the  extent of such  recovery,  the
obligation or part thereof originally  intended to be satisfied,  and all rights
and remedies  therefor,  shall be revived and continued in full force and effect

                                      109
<PAGE>

as if such  payment  had not been made or such  enforcement  or  setoff  had not
occurred,  and (ii) each Payee  shall pay and return such amount to the Agent as
the Agent may be required to disgorge or otherwise pay to a trustee, receiver or
any other  party in respect  of the  portion of the  payment  from the  Obligors
distributed by the Agent to such Payee hereunder.

     Section  10.14.  Section  Titles.  The  Section  titles  contained  in this
Agreement  are and shall be without  substantive  meaning or content of any kind
whatsoever and are not a part of the agreement between the parties hereto.

     Section 10.21. Acknowledgement Regarding Federal Authority.

     (a) Each of the parties  hereto and each of the  Participants  acknowledges
and agrees that:

     (i) the  operations  and  assets of the  Obligors  and  their  Subsidiaries
(including, without limitation, Aircraft Related Equipment and other assets that
constitute  Collateral) are subject,  directly and  indirectly,  to the actions,
inaction  and  policies  of  various  Governmental  Authorities,  including,  in
particular   but  without   limitation,   the  United   States   Department   of
Transportation (of which the Federal Aviation Administration is a component) and
the United States Department of Justice;

     (ii)  Governmental  Authorities,  in  discharging  their current and future
statutory  or  regulatory  responsibilities,  may act,  decline to act, or adopt
policies  resulting in material  adverse effects on (A) the business,  condition
(financial  or  otherwise),  operations,   performance,   prospects,  assets  or
properties  of the  Obligors  and their  Subsidiaries,  (B) the  ability  of the
Obligors  and their  Subsidiaries  to perform  their  payment or other  material
obligations under the Loan Documents, and (C) the value of the Collateral or the
practical  ability of the Collateral Agent to realize such value in the event of
a  Default  or  an  Event  of  Default;

     (iii) no Governmental Authority, in discharging its statutory or regulatory
responsibilities,  has or shall have any obligation  whatsoever to either of the
Obligors,  any of their Subsidiaries,  or to any secured party by reason of such
Governmental  Authority's  representation  on the Board, the Board's issuance of
the Board Guarantee,  or the Board's  participation as a party to the other Loan
Documents,  to consider the potential that any of the material  adverse  effects
referred to in clause (ii) above may result from such  Governmental  Authority's
discharge of its statutory or regulatory responsibilities; and

     (iv) neither the Board, in discharging its rights and responsibilities,  or
in  exercising  its  discretion,  under  the Act,  the  Regulations,  the  Board
Guarantee or the other Loan Documents, nor any of the Board's members, acting in
their capacities as such, has or shall have any obligation  whatsoever to either
of the Obligors,  any of their  Subsidiaries or to any of the secured parties to
take any action in connection with a Governmental  Authority's  discharge of its
statutory  or  regulatory  responsibilities  which may have any of the  material
adverse effects referred to in clause (ii) above, and the Board may not take any
action depriving a Governmental  Authority of its rights and powers to discharge
its statutory and regulatory responsibilities in any manner that may have any of
the material adverse effects referred to in clause (ii) above.

     (b) Without  limiting the generality of the foregoing,  the parties and the
Participants  acknowledge  and agree that (i) the Department of  Transportation,
through the Federal Aviation Administration,  has broad authority under Title 49

                                      112
<PAGE>

of the United States Code to regulate the use of the  navigable  airspace of the
United  States  so as to ensure  its safe and  efficient  utilization,  (ii) the
exercise of such authority may substantially  impair or eliminate altogether the
utility to the Obligors and their  Subsidiaries and value to the secured parties
of Aircraft  Related  Equipment  pledged as  Collateral  and other assets of the
Obligors and their  Subsidiaries  such as gates and slots  utilized at airports,
and (iii) no assurance,  express or implied,  has been given by any Governmental
Authority, including the Board, to the Obligors or to any secured party, nor has
either of the Obligors or any secured party relied upon any such assurance, with
respect  to any  future  action,  inaction  or  policy of the  Federal  Aviation
Administration  or  any  other  Governmental  Authority  relating  to  any  such
Collateral or other assets.

     (c) Nothing in this Section  10.21 shall be construed to limit or otherwise
affect the Board's obligations under the Board Guarantee.

     Section  10.22.  Cumulative  Rights and  Remedies.  The rights and remedies
conferred  upon the parties  hereto  shall be  cumulative,  and the  exercise or
waiver of any such right or remedy shall not preclude or inhibit the exercise of
any additional  rights or remedies.  The waiver of any right or remedy hereunder
shall not preclude the subsequent exercise of such right or remedy.

                                      113
