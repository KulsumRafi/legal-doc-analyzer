<P ALIGN="CENTER">CHANGE OF CONTROL SEVERANCE AGREEMENT</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This Change of Control Severance Agreement (the &quot;Agreement&quot;) is made and entered into by and between Darrel Slack (the &quot;Employee&quot;) and Centillium Communications, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the &quot;Company&quot;), effective as of January 14, 2003 (the &quot;Effective Date&quot;).</P>

</B></U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>It is expected that the Company from time to time will consider the possibility of an acquisition by another company or other change of control.  The Board of Directors of the Company (the &quot;Board&quot;) recognizes that such consideration can be a distraction to the Employee and can cause the Employee to consider alternative employment opportunities.  The Board has determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to assure that the Company will have the continued dedication and objectivity of the Employee, notwithstanding the possibility, threat or occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined herein) of the Company.</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>The Board believes that it is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to provide the Employee with an incentive to continue his or her employment and to motivate the Employee to maximize the value of the Company upon a Change of Control for the benefit of its stockholders.</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>The Board believes that it is imperative to provide the Employee with certain severance benefits upon the Employee's termination of employment following a Change of Control.  These benefits will provide the Employee with enhanced financial security and incentive and encouragement to remain with the Company notwithstanding the possibility of a Change of Control.</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Certain capitalized terms used in the Agreement are defined in Section 6 below.</LI></P>
<U><P ALIGN="CENTER">AGREEMENT</P>

The Company and the Employee acknowledge that the Employee's employment is and shall continue to be at-will, as defined under applicable law, except as may otherwise be specifically provided under the terms of any written formal employment agreement between the Company and the Employee (an &quot;Employment Agreement&quot;).  If the Employee's employment terminates for any reason, including (without limitation) any termination prior to a Change of Control, the Employee shall not be entitled to any payments, benefits, damages, awards or compensation other than as provided by this Agreement or under his or her Employment Agreement.</LI></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(ii)  <U>Involuntary Termination Other than for Cause or Occurrence of Good Reason Following a Change of Control</U>.  If within eighteen (18) months following a Change of Control (i) any of the events constituting &quot;Good Reason&quot; (as defined herein) occurs or (ii) the Company (or any parent or subsidiary of the Company) terminates the Employee's employment for other than &quot;Cause&quot; (as defined herein), then the following shall automatically occur:</P>

<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Timing of Severance Payments</U>.  The severance payment to which Employee is entitled shall be paid by the Company to Employee in cash and in full, not later than thirty (30) calendar days after the date of the termination of Employee's employment as provided in Section 3(a).

In the event the Employee's employment is terminated for any reason, either prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control or after the eighteen (18)-month period following a Change of Control, then the Employee shall be entitled to receive severance and any other benefits only as may then be established under the Company's existing written severance and benefits plans and practices or pursuant to other written agreements with the Company.</LI></P>
<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Exclusive Remedy</U>.  In the event of a termination of Employee's employment within eighteen (18) months following a Change of Control, the provisions of this Section 3 are intended to be and are exclusive and in lieu of any other rights or remedies to which the Employee or the Company may otherwise be entitled, whether at law, tort or contract, in equity, or under this Agreement.

Unless the Company and the Employee otherwise agree in writing, any determination required under this Section shall be made in writing by the Company's independent public accountants (the &quot;Accountants&quot;), whose determination shall be conclusive and binding upon the Employee and the Company for all purposes.

The Company and the Employee shall furnish to the Accountants such information and documents as the Accountants may reasonably request in order to make a determination under this Section.  The Company shall bear all costs the Accountants may reasonably incur in connection with any calculations contemplated by this Section.</LI></OL>
