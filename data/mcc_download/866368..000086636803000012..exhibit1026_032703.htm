          If the Partnership gives a notice of redemption in respect of Series G Preferred
          Units (which notice will be irrevocable) then, by 12:00 noon, New York City
          time, on the redemption date, the Partnership will deliver into escrow with an
          escrow agent acceptable to the Partnership and the holders of the Series G
          Preferred Units (the &#147;<B><U>Escrow Agent</U></B><U></U>&#148;) the Series G
          Redemption Price and an executed Redemption Agreement, in substantially the form
          attached hereto as <U>Exhibit A</U> (the &#147;<B><U>Redemption
          Agreement</U></B><U></U>&#148;), and an Amendment to the Agreement of Limited
          Partnership evidencing the redemption, in substantially the form attached hereto
          as <U>Exhibit B</U>. The holders of the Series G Preferred Units shall also, by
          12:00 noon, New York City time, on the redemption date, deliver into escrow with
          the Escrow Agent an executed Redemption Agreement and an executed Amendment to
          the Agreement of Limited Partnership evidencing the redemption. Upon delivery of
          all of the above-described items by both parties, Escrow Agent shall release the
          Series G Redemption Price to the holders of the Series G Preferred Units and the
          fully-executed Redemption Agreement and Amendment to Agreement of Limited
          Partnership to both parties. On and after the date of redemption, distributions
          will cease to accumulate on the Series G Preferred Units called for redemption,
          unless the Partnership defaults in the payment thereof. If any date fixed for
          redemption of Series G Preferred Units is not a Business Day, then payment of
          the Series G Redemption Price payable on such date will be made on the next
          succeeding day that is a Business Day (and without any interest or other payment
          in respect of any such delay) except that, if such Business Day falls in the
          next calendar year, such payment will be made on the immediately preceding
          Business Day, in each case with the same force and effect as if made on such
          date fixed for redemption. If payment of the Series G Redemption Price is
          improperly withheld or refused and not paid by the Partnership, distributions on
          such Series G Preferred Units will continue to accumulate from the original
          redemption date to the date of payment, in which case the actual payment date
          will be considered the date fixed for redemption for purposes of calculating the
          applicable Series G Redemption Price. </FONT></P>

          <U>Procedure for Exchange</U>. (i) Any exchange shall be exercised pursuant to a
          notice of exchange (the <B>&#147;<U>Exchange Notice</U></B><U></U>&#148;)
          delivered to the General Partner by the holder who is exercising such exchange
          right, by (a) fax and (b) by certified mail postage prepaid. The exchange of
          Series G Preferred Units may be effected after the fifth (5th) Business Day
          following receipt by the General Partner of the Exchange Notice by delivering
          certificates, if any, representing such Series G Preferred Units to be exchanged
          together with, if applicable, written notice of exchange and a proper assignment
          of such Series G Preferred Units to the office of the General Partner maintained
          for such purpose. Currently, such office is c/o PS Business Parks, Inc., 701
          Western Avenue, Glendale, California 91201, Attention: Jack E. Corrigan. Each
          exchange will be deemed to have been effected immediately prior to the close of
          business on the date on which such Series G Preferred Units to be exchanged
          (together with all required documentation) shall have been surrendered and
          notice shall have been received by the General Partner as aforesaid and the
          Series G Exchange Price shall have been paid. Any Series G Preferred Stock
          issued pursuant to this Section 8<B> </B>shall be delivered, as promptly as
          practicable, as shares which are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and
          nonassessable, free of pledge, lien, encumbrance or restriction other than those
          provided in the Charter, the Bylaws of the General Partner, the Securities Act
          of 1933, as amended, and relevant state securities or blue sky laws. </FONT></P>

          In the event of an exchange of Series G Preferred Units for shares of Series G
          Preferred Stock, an amount equal to the accrued and unpaid Priority Return,
          whether or not declared, to the date of exchange on any Series G Preferred Units
          tendered for exchange shall (a) accrue on the shares of the Series G Preferred
          Stock into which such Series G Preferred Units are exchanged, and (b) continue
          to accrue on such Series G Preferred Units, which shall remain outstanding
          following such exchange, with the General Partner as the holder of such Series G
          Preferred Units. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, in
          no event shall a holder of a Series G Preferred Unit that was validly exchanged
          into Series G Preferred Stock pursuant to this section (other than the General
          Partner now holding such Series G Preferred Unit), receive a distribution from
          the Partnership, if such holder, after exchange, is entitled to receive a
          distribution from the General Partner with respect to the share of Series G
          Preferred Stock for which such Series G Preferred Unit was exchanged or
          redeemed. </FONT></P>

          Fractional shares of Series G Preferred Stock are not to be issued upon exchange
          but, in lieu thereof, the General Partner will pay a cash adjustment based upon
          the fair market value of the Series G Preferred Stock on the day prior to the
          exchange date as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the
          General Partner. </FONT></P>

          <U>Adjustment of Series G Exchange Price</U>. (i) The Series G Exchange Price is
          subject to adjustment upon certain events, including, (a) subdivisions,
          combinations and reclassification of the Series G Preferred Stock, and (b)
          distributions to all holders of Series G Preferred Stock of evidences of
          indebtedness of the General Partner or assets (including securities, but
          excluding dividends and distributions paid in cash out of equity applicable to
          Series G Preferred Stock). </FONT></P>

          In case the General Partner shall be a party to any transaction (including,
          without limitation, a merger, consolidation, statutory share exchange, tender
          offer for all or substantially all of the General Partner&#146;s capital stock
          or sale of all or substantially all of the General Partner&#146;s assets), in
          each case as a result of which the Series G Preferred Stock will be converted
          into the right to receive shares of capital stock, other securities or other
          property (including cash or any combination thereof), each Series G Preferred
          Unit will thereafter be exchangeable into the kind and amount of shares of
          capital stock and other securities and property receivable (including cash or
          any combination thereof) upon the consummation of such transaction by a holder
          of that number of shares of Series G Preferred Stock or fraction thereof into
          which one Series G Preferred Unit was exchangeable immediately prior to such
          transaction. The General Partner may not become a party to any such transaction
          unless the terms thereof are consistent with the foregoing. In addition, so long
          as the Contributor or any of its permitted successors or assigns holds any
          Series G Preferred Units, the General Partner shall not, without the affirmative
          vote of the holders of at least a majority of the Series G Preferred Units
          outstanding at the time: (a) designate or create, or increase the authorized or
          issued amount of, any class or series of shares ranking senior to the Series G
          Preferred Stock with respect to the payment of distributions or rights upon
          liquidation, dissolution or winding-up or reclassify any authorized shares of
          the General Partner into any such shares, or create, authorize or issue any
          obligations or securities convertible into or evidencing the right to purchase
          any such shares; or (b) amend, alter or repeal the provisions of the Charter or
          Bylaws of the General Partner, whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise,
          that would materially and adversely affect the powers, special rights,
          preferences, privileges or voting power of the Series G Preferred Stock or the
          holders thereof; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that any increase in the
          amount of authorized Preferred Shares or the creation or issuance of any other
          series or class of Preferred Shares, or any increase in the amount of authorized
          shares of each class or series, in each case ranking either (1) junior to the
          Series G Preferred Stock with respect to the payment of distributions and the
          distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, or (2) on a
          parity with the Series G Preferred Stock with respect to the payment of
          distributions and the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or
          winding-up shall not be deemed to materially and adversely affect such rights,
          preferences, privileges or voting powers. In the event of a conflict between the
          provisions of this Section 8(c)(ii)<B> </B>and any provision of the Partnership
          Agreement, the provisions of this Section 8(c)(ii) shall control. </FONT></P>
