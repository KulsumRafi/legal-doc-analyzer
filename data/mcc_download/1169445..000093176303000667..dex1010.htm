specified to be paid, performed and observed by the Tenant, does hereby let, lease and demise to the Tenant, and the Tenant does hereby lease and take from the Landlord, that certain real estate with accompanying improvements and appurtenances

hereinafter contained, the Landlord and the Tenant do hereby covenant, promise and agree as follows: </font></p> <p> <font size="2"
face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Landlord does hereby lease unto Tenant and
Tenant does hereby lease from Landlord the Demised Premises for a term of one hundred twenty (120) calendar months commencing as of October 1, 2002 (hereinafter referred to as the &#147;Lease Term&#148;).</font></p> <p> <font size="2"
face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tenant shall during the first year of the
Lease Term, pay to the Landlord an annual rental of Seventy Two Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($72,000.00) unless abated or diminished as hereinafter provided, in equal monthly installments of Six Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($6,000.00) in advance, on
the 1st day of each month, commencing upon the 1<sup>st</sup> day of October, 2002.&#160; For each of the remaining nine years of the Lease Term, the rental rate shall be adjusted, as of March 31, 2003 and on March 31 of each year thereafter, in
accordance with changes in the Consumer Price Index (&#147;CPI&#148;) as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U), 1982-84 = 100.&#160; Upon each such lease rate adjustment date, the lease rate for the upcoming
year of the Lease Term shall be an amount equal to the monthly lease rate for the immediately preceding year multiplied by a fraction, the denominator of which shall be the CPI for April, 2002 and the numerator of which shall be the CPI for the
month of such lease rate adjustment. It is the intention of the parties that the determination of the adjusted lease rate shall not be distorted by any changes in the method by which the CPI is determined</font></p>

<p Style='page-break-before:always'>

Accordingly, if the method by which the CPI is determined or the form in which the CPI is presented is hereafter changed, the index used in the numerator of the fraction described above shall be adjusted so that such index is determined and
presented on the same basis as the CPI used in the denominator of such fraction.&#160; To the extent possible, such adjustment shall be based on any adjustment factor published by the U.S. Department of Labor or any successor governmental
agency.&#160; If for any reason the index used in the numerator of such fraction cannot be determined on the same basis as the CPI used in the denominator of such fraction, or if the CPI is not hereafter published, the adjusted lease rate shall be
determined by reference to the index of consumer prices then published by the U.S. Government, or an agency thereof, that most nearly resembles the CPI as in effect for April, 2002.</font></p> <p> <font size="2"

Demised Premises.</font></p> <p> <font size="2" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties hereby agree that ninety (90) days prior to the expiration of the first
five (5) years of the Lease Term, they shall obtain an appraisal, in accordance with the procedures set forth below, in order to determine the Fair Market Rental Value of the Demised Premises.&#160; Upon the completion of such appraisal, the rental
rate for the sixth (6<sup>th</sup>) year of the Lease Term shall be adjusted to an amount equal to the Fair Market Rental Value as set forth in said appraisal.</font></p> <p> <font size="2"
face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On or about the date that is ninety (90) days prior to the expiration of the fifth (5<sup>th</sup>) year of the Lease Term, Landlord and Tenant shall consult with one
another for the purpose of appointing a mutually acceptable qualified independent appraiser.&#160; If the parties are unable to agree on an appraiser within ten (10) days, such Fair Market Rental Value shall be determined by a panel of three
independent appraisers, one of whom shall be selected by each of Landlord and Tenant within five (5) days thereafter.&#160; If one party appoints an appraiser pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, and if the other party fails to appoint a
second appraiser within the applicable time limit, the appraisal shall be made by such appraiser.&#160; On or before the tenth day after appointment of the second appraiser, a third appraiser shall be selected by agreement of the first two
appraisers.&#160; Landlord and Tenant shall split all fees and expenses of the appraisers.&#160; Each appraiser appointed pursuant to the foregoing procedure shall be experienced, have equivalent qualifications to those of a senior member of the
American Society of Appraisers, shall be independent of Landlord and Tenant, and shall be instructed to determine Fair Market Rental Value in accordance with the uniform standards for professional appraisal practice or the equivalent, before the
45<sup>th</sup> day after the appointment of the last of such appraisers to be appointed, and such determination shall be final, binding and conclusive upon the parties.&#160; If three appraisers shall be appointed, the determination of Fair Market
Rental Value shall be the average of the three appraisals rendered by the appraisers.&#160; In the event, however, that the lowest or the highest of the three appraisals, or both, varies by more than ten percent (10%) from the middle appraisal, the
appraisal or appraisals so varying shall be disregarded and the average of the remaining appraisals, or the remaining appraisal, shall be the determination of Fair Market Rental Value.</font></p> <p><font size="2"
