Currency on the Equivalent in Dollars determined on the date of delivery of the
applicable Notice of Revolving Credit Borrowing), not to exceed at any time
outstanding such Lender's Commitment, provided that the aggregate amount of the
Commitments of the Lenders shall be deemed used from time to time to the extent
of the aggregate amount (based in respect of any Competitive Bid Advance
denominated in a Foreign Currency on the Equivalent in Dollars at such time) of
the Competitive Bid Advances then outstanding and such deemed use of the
aggregate amount of the Commitments shall be allocated among the Lenders ratably
according to their respective Commitments (such deemed use of the aggregate
amount of the Commitments being a "Competitive Bid Reduction"). Each Revolving
Credit Borrowing shall be in an aggregate amount not less than $10,000,000 (or
the Equivalent thereof in any Major Currency determined on the date of delivery
of the applicable Notice of Revolving Credit Borrowing) or an integral multiple
of $1,000,000 (or the Equivalent thereof in any Major Currency determined on the
date of delivery of the applicable Notice of Revolving Credit Borrowing) in
excess thereof and shall consist of Revolving Credit Advances of the same Type
made on the same day by the Lenders ratably according to their respective
Commitments; provided, however, that if there is no unused portion of the
Commitment of one or more Lenders at the time of any requested Revolving Credit
Borrowing such Borrowing shall consist of Revolving Credit Advances of the same
Type made on the same day by the Lender or Lenders who do then have an unused
portion of their Commitments ratably according to the unused portion of such
Commitments. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no Revolving
Credit Borrowing may be made in a Major Currency if, after giving effect to the
making of such Revolving Credit Borrowing, the Equivalent in Dollars of the
aggregate amount of outstanding Revolving Credit Advances denominated in Major
Currencies, together with the Equivalent in Dollars of the aggregate amount of
outstanding Competitive Bid Advances denominated in Foreign Currencies, would
exceed $500,000,000. Within the limits of each Lender's Commitment, any Borrower
may borrow under this Section 2.01, prepay pursuant to Section 2.09 and reborrow
under this Section 2.01.

          SECTION 2.02. Making the Revolving Credit Advances. (a) Each Revolving
Credit Borrowing shall be made on notice, given not later than (x) 10:00 A.M.
(New York City time) on the third Business Day prior to the date of the proposed
Revolving Credit Borrowing in the case of a Revolving Credit Borrowing
consisting of Eurocurrency Rate Advances denominated in any Major Currency, (y)
11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the third Business Day prior to the date of
the proposed Revolving Credit Borrowing in the case of a Revolving Credit
Borrowing consisting of Eurocurrency Rate Advances denominated in Dollars or (z)
9:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the day of the proposed Revolving Credit
Borrowing in the case of a Revolving Credit Borrowing consisting of Base Rate
Advances, by any Borrower to the Agent (and the Agent shall, in the case of a
Revolving Credit Borrowing consisting of Eurocurrency Rate Advances, immediately
relay such notice to the Sub-Agent), which shall give


                                       17




<PAGE>

to each Lender prompt notice thereof by telecopier or telex. Each such notice of
a Revolving Credit Borrowing (a "Notice of Revolving Credit Borrowing") shall be
by telephone, confirmed immediately in writing, or telecopier or telex in
substantially the form of Exhibit B-1 hereto, specifying therein the requested
(i) date of such Revolving Credit Borrowing, (ii) Type of Advances comprising
such Revolving Credit Borrowing, (iii) aggregate amount of such Revolving Credit
Borrowing, and (iv) in the case of a Revolving Credit Borrowing consisting of
Eurocurrency Rate Advances, initial Interest Period and currency for each such
Revolving Credit Advance. Each Lender shall, before 11:00 A.M. (New York City
time) on the date of such Revolving Credit Borrowing, in the case of a Revolving
Credit Borrowing consisting of Advances denominated in Dollars, and before 11:00
A.M. (London time) on the date of such Revolving Credit Borrowing, in the case
of a Revolving Credit Borrowing consisting of Eurocurrency Rate Advances
denominated in any Major Currency, make available for the account of its
Applicable Lending Office to the Agent at the applicable Agent's account, in
same day funds, such Lender's ratable portion (as determined in accordance with
Section 2.01) of such Revolving Credit Borrowing. After the Agent's receipt of
such funds and upon fulfillment of the applicable conditions set forth in
Article III, the Agent will make such funds available to the Borrower requesting
the Revolving Credit Borrowing at the Agent's aforesaid address or at the
applicable Payment Office, as the case may be.

          (b) Anything in subsection (a) above to the contrary notwithstanding,
a Borrower may not select Eurocurrency Rate Advances for any proposed Revolving
Credit Borrowing if the obligation of the Lenders to make Eurocurrency Rate
Advances shall then be suspended pursuant to Section 2.08 or 2.11.

          (c) Each Notice of Revolving Credit Borrowing of any Borrower shall be
irrevocable and binding on such Borrower. In the case of any Revolving Credit
Borrowing that the related Notice of Revolving Credit Borrowing specifies is to
be comprised of Eurocurrency Rate Advances, the Borrower requesting such
Revolving Credit Borrowing shall indemnify each Lender against any loss, cost or
expense incurred by such Lender as a result of any failure by such Borrower to
fulfill on or before the date specified in such Notice of Revolving Credit
Borrowing for such Revolving Credit Borrowing the applicable conditions set
forth in Article III, including, without limitation, any loss (including loss of
anticipated profits), cost or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or
reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by such Lender to fund the
Revolving Credit Advance to be made by such Lender as part of such Revolving
Credit Borrowing when such Revolving Credit Advance, as a result of such
failure, is not made on such date.

          (d) Unless the Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to
the date of any Revolving Credit Borrowing that such Lender will not make
available to the Agent such Lender's ratable portion of such Revolving Credit
Borrowing, the Agent may assume that such Lender has made such portion available
to the Agent on the date of such Revolving Credit Borrowing in accordance with
subsection (a) of this Section 2.02 and the Agent may, in reliance upon such
assumption, make available to the Borrower proposing such Revolving Credit
Borrowing on such date a corresponding amount. If and to the extent that such
Lender shall not have so made such ratable portion available to the Agent, such
Lender and such Borrower severally agree to repay to the Agent forthwith on
demand such corresponding amount together with interest thereon, for each day
from the date such amount is made available to such Borrower


                                       18




<PAGE>

until the date such amount is repaid to the Agent, at (i) in the case of such
Borrower, the higher of (A) the interest rate applicable at the time to
Revolving Credit Advances comprising such Revolving Credit Borrowing and (B) the
cost of funds incurred by the Agent in respect of such amount and (ii) in the
case of such Lender, (A) the Federal Funds Rate in the case of Advances
denominated in Dollars or (B) the cost of funds incurred by the Agent in respect
of such amount in the case of Advances denominated in any Major Currency. If
such Lender shall repay to the Agent such corresponding amount, such amount so
repaid shall constitute such Lender's Revolving Credit Advance as part of such
Revolving Credit Borrowing for purposes of this Agreement.

          (e) The failure of any Lender to make the Revolving Credit Advance to
be made by it as part of any Revolving Credit Borrowing shall not relieve any
other Lender of its obligation, if any, hereunder to make its Revolving Credit
Advance on the date of such Revolving Credit Borrowing, but no Lender shall be
responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make the Revolving Credit
Advance to be made by such other Lender on the date of any Revolving Credit
Borrowing.

          SECTION 2.03. The Competitive Bid Advances. (a) Each Lender severally
agrees that any Borrower may request Competitive Bid Borrowings under this
Section 2.03 from time to time on any Business Day during the period from the
date hereof until the date occurring seven days prior to the Termination Date in
the manner set forth below; provided that, following the making of each
Competitive Bid Borrowing, the aggregate amount (based in respect of any Advance
denominated in a Foreign Currency on the Equivalent in Dollars on such Business
Day) of the Advances then outstanding shall not exceed the aggregate amount of
the Commitments of the Lenders (computed without regard to any Competitive Bid
Reduction). Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no Competitive Bid
Borrowing may be made in a Foreign Currency if, after giving effect to the
making of such Revolving Credit Borrowing, the Equivalent in Dollars of the
aggregate amount of outstanding Competitive Bid Advances denominated in Foreign
Currencies, together with the Equivalent in Dollars of the aggregate amount of
outstanding Revolving Credit Advances denominated in Major Currencies, would
exceed $500,000,000.

          (i) Any Borrower may request a Competitive Bid Borrowing under this
     Section 2.03 by delivering to the Agent (and the Agent shall, in the case
     of a Competitive Bid Borrowing not consisting of Fixed Rate Advances or
     LIBO Rate Advances to be denominated in Dollars, immediately notify the
     Sub-Agent), by telecopier or telex, a notice of a Competitive Bid Borrowing
     (a "Notice of Competitive Bid Borrowing"), in substantially the form of
     Exhibit B-2 hereto, specifying therein the requested (A) date of such
     proposed Competitive Bid Borrowing, (B) aggregate amount of such proposed
     Competitive Bid Borrowing, (C) interest rate basis and day count convention
     to be offered by the Lenders, (D) currency of such proposed Competitive Bid
     Borrowing, (E) in the case of a Competitive Bid Borrowing consisting of
     LIBO Rate Advances, Interest Period of each Competitive Bid Advance to be
     made as part of such Competitive Bid Borrowing, or in the case of a
     Competitive Bid Borrowing consisting of Fixed Rate Advances or Local Rate
     Advances, maturity date for repayment of each Fixed Rate Advance or Local
     Rate Advance to be made as part of such Competitive Bid Borrowing (which
     maturity date may not be earlier than the date occurring five days after
     the date of


                                       19




<PAGE>

     such Competitive Bid Borrowing or later than the Termination Date), (F)
     interest payment date or dates relating thereto, (G) location of such
     Borrower's account to which funds are to be advanced, and (H) other terms
     (if any) to be applicable to such Competitive Bid Borrowing, not later than
     (w) 10:00 A.M. (New York City time) at least one Business Day prior to the
     date of the proposed Competitive Bid Borrowing, if such Borrower shall
     specify in its Notice of Competitive Bid Borrowing that the rates of
     interest to be offered by the Lenders shall be fixed rates per annum (each
     Advance comprising any such Competitive Bid Borrowing being referred to
     herein as a "Fixed Rate Advance") and that the Advances comprising such
     proposed Competitive Bid Borrowing shall be denominated in Dollars, (x)
     10:00 A.M. (New York City time) at least four Business Days prior to the
     date of the proposed Competitive Bid Borrowing, if such Borrower shall
     instead specify in its Notice of Competitive Bid Borrowing that the
     Advances comprising such Competitive Bid Borrowing shall be LIBO Rate
     Advances denominated in Dollars, (y) 3:00 P.M. (New York City time) at
     least three Business Days prior to the date of the proposed Competitive Bid
     Borrowing, if such Borrower shall specify in the Notice of Competitive Bid
     Borrowing that the Advances comprising such proposed Competitive Bid
     Borrowing shall be either Fixed Rate Advances denominated in any Foreign
     Currency or Local Rate Advances denominated in any Foreign Currency and (z)
     3:00 P.M. (New York City time) at least five Business Days prior to the
     date of the proposed Competitive Bid Borrowing, if such Borrower shall
     instead specify in its Notice of Competitive Bid Borrowing that the
     Advances comprising such Competitive Bid Borrowing shall be LIBO Rate
     Advances denominated in any Foreign Currency. Each Notice of Competitive
     Bid Borrowing shall be irrevocable and binding on such Borrower. Any Notice
     of Competitive Bid Borrowing by a Designated Subsidiary shall be given to
     the Agent in accordance with the preceding sentence through the Company on
     behalf of such Designated Subsidiary. The Agent shall in turn promptly
     notify each Lender of each request for a Competitive Bid Borrowing received
     by it from such Borrower by sending such Lender a copy of the related
     Notice of Competitive Bid Borrowing.

          (ii) Each Lender may, if, in its sole discretion, it elects to do so,
     irrevocably offer to make one or more Competitive Bid Advances to the
     Borrower proposing the Competitive Bid Borrowing as part of such proposed
     Competitive Bid Borrowing at a rate or rates of interest specified by such
     Lender in its sole discretion, by notifying the Agent (which shall give
     prompt notice thereof to such Borrower and to the Sub-Agent, if
     applicable), (A) before 9:30 A.M. (New York City time) on the date of such
     proposed Competitive Bid Borrowing, in the case of a Competitive Bid
     Borrowing consisting of Fixed Rate Advances denominated in Dollars, (B)
     before 10:00 A.M. (New York City time) three Business Days before the date
     of such proposed Competitive Bid Borrowing, in the case of a Competitive
     Bid Borrowing consisting of LIBO Rate Advances denominated in Dollars, (C)
     before 10:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the second Business Day prior to
     the date of such proposed Competitive Bid Borrowing, in the case of a
     Competitive Bid Borrowing consisting of either Fixed Rate Advances
     denominated in any Foreign Currency or Local Rate Advances denominated in
     any Foreign Currency and (D) before 10:00 A.M. (New York City time) four
     Business Days before the date of such proposed Competitive Bid Borrowing,
     in the case of a Competitive Bid Borrowing consisting of LIBO Rate Advances
     denominated in any Foreign Currency, of the


                                       20




<PAGE>

     minimum amount and maximum amount of each Competitive Bid Advance which
     such Lender would be willing to make as part of such proposed Competitive
     Bid Borrowing (which amounts, or the Equivalent thereof in Dollars, as the
     case may be, may, subject to the proviso to the first sentence of this
     Section 2.03(a), exceed such Lender's Commitment, if any), the rate or
     rates of interest therefor and such Lender's Applicable Lending Office with
     respect to such Competitive Bid Advance; provided that if the Agent in its
     capacity as a Lender shall, in its sole discretion, elect to make any such
     offer, it shall notify such Borrower of such offer at least 30 minutes
     before the time and on the date on which notice of such election is to be
     given to the Agent, by the other Lenders. If any Lender shall elect not to
     make such an offer, such Lender shall so notify the Agent, before 10:00
     A.M. (New York City time) (and the Agent shall notify the Sub-Agent, if
     applicable) on the date on which notice of such election is to be given to
     the Agent by the other Lenders, and such Lender shall not be obligated to,
     and shall not, make any Competitive Bid Advance as part of such Competitive
     Bid Borrowing; provided that the failure by any Lender to give such notice
     shall not cause such Lender to be obligated to make any Competitive Bid
     Advance as part of such proposed Competitive Bid Borrowing.

          (iii) The Borrower proposing the Competitive Bid Advance shall, in
     turn, (A) before 10:30 A.M. (New York City time) on the date of such
     proposed Competitive Bid Borrowing, in the case of a Competitive Bid
     Borrowing consisting of Fixed Rate Advances denominated in Dollars, (B)
     before 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) three Business Days before the date
     of such proposed Competitive Bid Borrowing, in the case of a Competitive
     Bid Borrowing consisting of LIBO Rate Advances denominated in Dollars, (C)
     before 10:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the Business Day prior to the
     date of such Competitive Bid Borrowing, in the case of a Competitive Bid
     Borrowing consisting of either Fixed Rate Advances denominated in any
     Foreign Currency or Local Rate Advances denominated in any Foreign Currency
     and (D) before 10:00 A.M. (New York City time) three Business Days before
     the date of such proposed Competitive Bid Borrowing, in the case of a
     Competitive Bid Borrowing consisting of LIBO Rate Advances denominated in
     any Foreign Currency, either:

               (x) cancel such Competitive Bid Borrowing by giving the Agent
          notice to that effect, or

               (y) accept one or more of the offers made by any Lender or
          Lenders pursuant to paragraph (ii) above, in its sole discretion, by
          giving notice to the Agent (and the Agent shall give notice to the
          Sub-Agent, if applicable) of the amount of each Competitive Bid
          Advance (which amount shall be equal to or greater than the minimum
          amount, and equal to or less than the maximum amount, notified to such
          Borrower by the Agent on behalf of such Lender for such Competitive
          Bid Advance pursuant to paragraph (ii) above) to be made by each
          Lender as part of such Competitive Bid Borrowing, and reject any
          remaining offers made by Lenders pursuant to paragraph (ii) above by
          giving the Agent notice to that effect; provided, however, that such
          Borrower shall not accept any offer in excess of the requested bid
          amount for any maturity. Such Borrower shall accept the offers made by
          any Lender or Lenders to make Competitive Bid


                                       21




<PAGE>

          Advances in order of the lowest to the highest rates of interest
          offered by such Lenders. If two or more Lenders have offered the same
          interest rate, the amount to be borrowed at such interest rate will be
          allocated among such Lenders in proportion to the amount that each
          such Lender offered at such interest rate.

          (iv) If the Borrower proposing the Competitive Bid Borrowing notifies
     the Agent that such Competitive Bid Borrowing is canceled pursuant to
     paragraph (iii)(x) above, the Agent shall give prompt notice thereof to the
     Lenders and such Competitive Bid Borrowing shall not be made.

          (v) If the Borrower proposing the Competitive Bid Borrowing accepts
     one or more of the offers made by any Lender or Lenders pursuant to
     paragraph (iii)(y) above, the Agent shall in turn promptly notify (A) each
     Lender that has made an offer as described in paragraph (ii) above, of the
     date and aggregate amount of such Competitive Bid Borrowing and whether or
     not any offer or offers made by such Lender pursuant to paragraph (ii)
     above have been accepted by the Borrower, (B) each Lender that is to make a
     Competitive Bid Advance as part of such Competitive Bid Borrowing, of the
     amount of each Competitive Bid Advance to be made by such Lender as part of
     such Competitive Bid Borrowing, and (C) each Lender that is to make a
     Competitive Bid Advance as part of such Competitive Bid Borrowing, upon
     receipt, that the Agent has received forms of documents appearing to
     fulfill the applicable conditions set forth in Article III. Each Lender
     that is to make a Competitive Bid Advance as part of such Competitive Bid
     Borrowing shall, before 11:00 A.M. (New York City time), in the case of
     Competitive Bid Advances to be denominated in Dollars or 11:00 A.M. (London
     time), in the case of Competitive Bid Advances to be denominated in any
     Foreign Currency, on the date of such Competitive Bid Borrowing specified
     in the notice received from the Agent pursuant to clause (A) of the
     preceding sentence or any later time when such Lender shall have received
     notice from the Agent pursuant to clause (C) of the preceding sentence,
     make available for the account of its Applicable Lending Office to the
     Agent (x) in the case of a Competitive Bid Borrowing denominated in
     Dollars, at its address referred to in Section 9.02, in same day funds,
     such Lender's portion of such Competitive Bid Borrowing in Dollars, and (y)
     in the case of a Competitive Bid Borrowing in a Foreign Currency, at the
     Payment Office for such Foreign Currency as shall have been notified by the
     Agent to the Lenders prior thereto, in same day funds, such Lender's
     portion of such Competitive Bid Borrowing in such Foreign Currency. Upon
     fulfillment of the applicable conditions set forth in Article III and after
     receipt by the Agent of such funds, the Agent will make such funds
     available to such Borrower's account at the location specified by such
     Borrower in its Notice of Competitive Bid Borrowing. Promptly after each
     Competitive Bid Borrowing the Agent will notify each Lender of the amount
     of such Competitive Bid Borrowing, the consequent Competitive Bid Reduction
     and the dates upon which such Competitive Bid Reduction commenced and will
     terminate.

          (vi) If the Borrower proposing the Competitive Bid Borrowing notifies
     the Agent that it accepts one or more of the offers made by any Lender or
     Lenders pursuant to paragraph (iii)(y) above, such notice of acceptance
     shall be irrevocable and binding on such Borrower. Such Borrower shall
     indemnify each Lender against any loss, cost or


                                       22




<PAGE>

     expense incurred by such Lender as a result of any failure by such Borrower
     to fulfill on or before the date specified in the related Notice of
     Competitive Bid Borrowing for such Competitive Bid Borrowing the applicable
     conditions set forth in Article III, including, without limitation, any
     loss (including loss of anticipated profits), cost or expense incurred by
     reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds
     acquired by such Lender to fund the Competitive Bid Advance to be made by
     such Lender as part of such Competitive Bid Borrowing when such Competitive
     Bid Advance, as a result of such failure, is not made on such date.

          (b) Each Competitive Bid Borrowing shall be in an aggregate amount not
less than $10,000,000 (or the Equivalent thereof in any Foreign Currency,
determined as of the time of the applicable Notice of Competitive Bid Borrowing)
or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 (or the Equivalent thereof in any Foreign
Currency, determined as of the time of the applicable Notice of Competitive Bid
Borrowing) in excess thereof and, following the making of each Competitive Bid
Borrowing, the Borrower that has borrowed such Competitive Bid Borrowing shall
be in compliance with the limitation set forth in the proviso to the first
sentence of subsection (a) above.

          (c) Within the limits and on the conditions set forth in this Section
2.03, any Borrower may from time to time borrow under this Section 2.03, repay
or prepay pursuant to subsection (d) below, and reborrow under this Section
2.03, provided that a Competitive Bid Borrowing shall not be made within three
Business Days of the date of any other Competitive Bid Borrowing.

          (d) Any Borrower that has borrowed through a Competitive Bid Borrowing
shall repay to the Agent for the account of each Lender that has made a
Competitive Bid Advance, on the maturity date of such Competitive Bid Advance
(such maturity date being that specified by such Borrower for repayment of such
Competitive Bid Advance in the related Notice of Competitive Bid Borrowing
delivered pursuant to subsection (a)(i) above and provided in the Competitive
Bid Note evidencing such Competitive Bid Advance), the then unpaid principal
amount of such Competitive Bid Advance. Such Borrower shall have no right to
prepay any principal amount of any Competitive Bid Advance unless, and then only
on the terms, specified by such Borrower for such Competitive Bid Advance in the
related Notice of Competitive Bid Borrowing delivered pursuant to subsection
(a)(i) above and set forth in the Competitive Bid Note evidencing such
Competitive Bid Advance.

          (e) Each Borrower that has borrowed through a Competitive Bid
Borrowing shall pay interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Competitive
Bid Advance comprising such Competitive Bid Borrowing from the date of such
Competitive Bid Advance to the date the principal amount of such Competitive Bid
Advance is repaid in full, at the rate of interest for such Competitive Bid
Advance specified by the Lender making such Competitive Bid Advance in its
notice with respect thereto delivered pursuant to subsection (a)(ii) above,
payable on the interest payment date or dates specified by such Borrower for
such Competitive Bid Advance in the related Notice of Competitive Bid Borrowing
delivered pursuant to subsection (a)(i) above, as provided in the Competitive
Bid Note evidencing such Competitive Bid Advance. Upon the occurrence and during
the continuance of an Event of Default under Section 6.01(a), such Borrower
shall pay interest on the amount of unpaid principal of and interest on each


                                       23




<PAGE>

Competitive Bid Advance owing to a Lender, payable in arrears on the date or
dates interest is payable thereon, at a rate per annum equal at all times to 1%
per annum above the rate per annum required to be paid on such Competitive Bid
Advance under the terms of the Competitive Bid Note evidencing such Competitive
Bid Advance unless otherwise agreed in such Competitive Bid Note.

          (f) The indebtedness of any Borrower resulting from each Competitive
Bid Advance made to such Borrower as part of a Competitive Bid Borrowing shall
be evidenced by a separate Competitive Bid Note of the Borrower payable to the
order of the Lender making such Competitive Bid Advance.

          SECTION 2.04. Fees. (a) Facility Fee. The Company agrees to pay to the
Agent for the account of each Lender a facility fee on the aggregate amount of
such Lender's Commitment from the date hereof in the case of each Initial Lender
and from the effective date specified in the Assumption Agreement or the
Assignment and Acceptance, as the case may be, pursuant to which it became a
Lender in the case of each other Lender until the Termination Date at a rate per
annum equal to the Applicable Percentage in effect from time to time, payable in
arrears quarterly on the last day of each March, June, September and December,
commencing December 31, 2002, and on the Termination Date.

          (b) Agent's Fees. The Company shall pay to the Agent for its own
account such fees, and at such times, as the Company and the Agent may
separately agree.

          SECTION 2.05. Termination or Reduction of the Commitments. (a)
Optional Ratable Termination or Reduction. The Company shall have the right,
upon at least three Business Days' notice to the Agent, to terminate in whole or
reduce ratably in part the unused portions of the respective Commitments of the
Lenders, provided that each partial reduction shall be in an aggregate amount
not less than $10,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess
thereof and provided further that the aggregate amount of the Commitments of the
Lenders shall not be reduced to an amount that is less than the sum of the
aggregate principal amount of the Competitive Bid Advances denominated in
Dollars then outstanding plus the Equivalent in Dollars (determined as of the
date of the notice of prepayment) of the aggregate principal amount of the
Competitive Bid Advances denominated in Foreign Currencies then outstanding. The
aggregate amount of the Commitments, once reduced as provided in this Section
2.05(a), may not be reinstated.

          (b) Non-Ratable Termination by Assignment. The Company shall have the
right, upon at least ten Business Days' written notice to the Agent (which shall
then give prompt notice thereof to the relevant Lender), to require any Lender
to assign, pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of Section 9.07,
all of its rights and obligations under this Agreement and under the Notes to an
Eligible Assignee selected by the Company; provided, however, that (i) no Event
of Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of such request and
at the time of such assignment; (ii) the assignee shall have paid to the
assigning Lender the aggregate principal amount of, and any interest accrued and
unpaid to the date of such assignment on, the Note or Notes of such Lender;
(iii) the Company shall have paid to the assigning Lender any and all facility

(including, but not limited to, any increased costs or other additional amounts
owing under Section 2.10 and any indemnification for Taxes under Section 2.13)
as of the effective date of such assignment; and (iv) if the assignee selected
by the Company is not an existing Lender, such assignee or the Company shall
have paid the processing and recordation fee required under Section 9.07(a) for
such assignment; provided further that the Company shall have no right to
replace more than three Lenders in any calendar year pursuant to this Section
2.05(b); and provided further that the assigning Lender's rights under Sections
2.10, 2.13 and 9.04, and its obligations under Section 8.05, shall survive such
assignment as to matters occurring prior to the date of assignment.

          (c) Non-Ratable Reduction. (i) The Company shall have the right, at
any time other than during any Rating Condition, upon at least ten Business
Days' notice to a Lender (with a copy to the Agent), to terminate in whole such
Lender's Commitment (determined without giving effect to any Competitive Bid
Reduction). Such termination shall be effective, (i) with respect to such
Lender's unused Commitment, on the date set forth in such notice, provided,
however, that such date shall be no earlier than ten Business Days after receipt
of such notice and (ii) with respect to each Advance outstanding to such Lender,
on the last day of the then current Interest Period relating to such Advance;
provided further, however, that such termination shall not be effective, if,
after giving effect to such termination, the Company would, under this Section
2.05(c), reduce the Lenders' Commitments in any calendar year by an amount in
excess of the Commitments of any three Lenders or $480,000,000, whichever is
greater on the date of such termination. Notwithstanding the preceding proviso,
the Company may terminate in whole the Commitment of any Lender in accordance
with the terms and conditions set forth in Section 2.05(b) or 2.16(b). Upon
termination of a Lender's Commitment under this Section 2.05(c), the Company
will pay or cause to be paid all principal of, and interest accrued to the date
of such payment on, Advances owing to such Lender and pay any facility fees or
other fees payable to such Lender pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.04,
and all other amounts payable to such Lender hereunder (including, but not
limited to, any increased costs or other amounts owing under Section 2.10 and
any indemnification for Taxes under Section 2.13); and upon such payments, the
obligations of such Lender hereunder shall, by the provisions hereof, be
released and discharged; provided, however, that such Lender's rights under
Sections 2.10, 2.13 and 9.04, and its obligations under Section 8.05 shall
survive such release and discharge as to matters occurring prior to such date.
The aggregate amount of the Commitments of the Lenders once reduced pursuant to
this Section 2.05(c) may not be reinstated.

          (ii) For purposes of this Section 2.05(c) only, the term "Rating
Condition" shall mean a period commencing with notice (a "Rating Condition
Notice") by the Agent to the Company and the Lenders to the effect that the
Agent has been informed that the rating of the senior public Debt of the Company
is unsatisfactory under the standard set forth in the next sentence, and ending
with notice by the Agent to the Company and the Lenders to the effect that such
condition no longer exists. The Agent shall give a Rating Condition Notice
promptly upon receipt from the Company or any Lender of notice stating, in
effect, that both of S&P and Moody's (or any successor by merger or
consolidation to the business of either thereof), respectively, then rate the
senior public Debt of the Company lower than BBB- and Baa3. The Company agrees
to give notice to the Agent forthwith upon any change in a rating by either such
organization of the senior public Debt of the Company; the Agent shall have no
duty whatsoever to verify the accuracy of any such notice from the Company or
any Lender or to monitor


                                       25




<PAGE>

independently the ratings of the senior public Debt of the Company and no Lender
shall have any duty to give any such notice. The Agent shall give notice to the
Lenders and the Company as to the termination of a Rating Condition promptly
upon receiving a notice from the Company to the Agent (which notice the Agent
shall promptly notify to the Lenders) stating that the rating of the senior
public Debt of the Company does not meet the standard set forth in the second
sentence of this clause (ii), and requesting that the Agent notify the Lenders
of the termination of the Rating Condition. The Rating Condition shall terminate
upon the giving of such notice by the Agent.

          (d) Termination by a Lender. In the event that a Change of Control
occurs, each Lender may, by notice to the Company and the Agent given not later
than 50 calendar days after such Change of Control, terminate its Commitment,
which Commitment shall be terminated effective as of the later of (i) the date
that is 60 calendar days after such Change of Control or (ii) the end of the
Interest Period for any Advance outstanding at the time of such Change of
Control or for any Advance made pursuant to the next sentence of this Section
2.05(d). Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, each Borrower's right to
make a Borrowing under this Agreement shall be suspended for a period of 60
calendar days, except for Advances having an interest period ending not later
than 90 calendar days after such Change of Control. A notice of termination
pursuant to this Section 2.05(d) shall not have the effect of accelerating any
outstanding Advance of such Lender and the Notes of such Lender.

          (e) Mandatory Reduction. On the Termination Date, if the Company has
made the Term Loan Election in accordance with Section 2.06 prior to such date,
and from time to time thereafter upon each prepayment of the Revolving Credit
Advances, the Commitments of the Lenders shall be automatically and permanently
reduced on a pro rata basis by an amount equal to the amount by which (i) the
aggregate Commitments immediately prior to such reduction exceeds (ii) the
aggregate unpaid principal amount of all Revolving Credit Advances outstanding
at such time.

          SECTION 2.06. Repayment of Advances. (a) Revolving Credit Advances.
Each Borrower shall, subject to the next succeeding sentence, repay to the Agent
for the ratable account of the Lenders on the Termination Date the aggregate
principal amount of the Revolving Credit Advances then outstanding. The Company
may, upon not less than 15 days' notice to the Agent, elect (the "Term Loan
Election") to convert all of the Revolving Credit Advances outstanding on the
Termination Date in effect at such time into a term loan which the Borrowers
shall repay in full ratably to the Lenders on the Maturity Date; provided that
the Term Loan Election may not be exercised if on the date of notice of the Term
Loan Election or on the date on which the Term Loan Election is to be effected
(x) a Default has occurred and is continuing or (y) the representations and
warranties in Section 4.01 (other than the representations set forth in the last
sentence of subsection (e) thereof and in subsections (f), (h)-(l) and (n)
thereof) are not true and correct as though made on and as of such date. All
Revolving Credit Advances converted into a term loan pursuant to this Section
2.06(a) shall continue to constitute Revolving Credit Advances except that the
Borrowers may not reborrow pursuant to Section 2.01 after all or any portion of
such Revolving Credit Advances have been prepaid pursuant to Section 2.09.

          (b) Competitive Bid Advances. Each Borrower shall repay to the
Administrative Agent, for the account of each Lender that has made a Competitive
Bid Advance, the aggregate outstanding principal amount of each Competitive Bid
Advance made to such


                                       26




<PAGE>

Borrower and owing to such Lender on the earlier of (i) the maturity date
therefor, specified in the related Notice of Competitive Bid Borrowing delivered
pursuant to Section 2.03(a)(i) and (ii) the Termination Date.

          SECTION 2.07. Interest on Revolving Credit Advances. (a) Scheduled
Interest. Each Borrower shall pay interest on the unpaid principal amount of
each Revolving Credit Advance owing by such Borrower to each Lender from the
date of such Revolving Credit Advance until such principal amount shall be paid
in full, at the following rates per annum:

          (i) Base Rate Advances. During such periods as such Revolving Credit
     Advance is a Base Rate Advance, a rate per annum equal at all times to the
     sum of (x) the Base Rate in effect from time to time plus (y) the
     Applicable Margin in effect from time to time plus (z) the Applicable
     Utilization Fee in effect from time to time, payable in arrears quarterly
     on the last day of each March, June, September and December during such
     periods and on the date such Base Rate Advance shall be paid in full.

          (ii) Eurocurrency Rate Advances. During such periods as such Revolving
     Credit Advance is a Eurocurrency Rate Advance, a rate per annum equal at
     all times during each Interest Period for such Revolving Credit Advance to
     the sum of (x) the Eurocurrency Rate for such Interest Period for such
     Revolving Credit Advance plus (y) the Applicable Margin in effect from time
     to time plus (z) the Applicable Utilization Fee in effect from time to
     time, payable in arrears on the last day of such Interest Period and, if
     such Interest Period has a duration of more than three months, on each day
     that occurs during such Interest Period every three months from the first
     day of such Interest Period and on the date such Eurocurrency Rate Advance
     shall be Converted or paid in full.

          (b) Default Interest. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance
of an Event of Default under Section 6.01(a), each Borrower shall pay interest
on (i) the unpaid principal amount of each Revolving Credit Advance owing by
such Borrower to each Lender, payable in arrears on the dates referred to in
clause (a)(i) or (a)(ii) above, at a rate per annum equal at all times to 1% per
annum above the rate per annum required to be paid on such Revolving Credit
Advance pursuant to clause (a)(i) or (a)(ii) above and (ii) to the fullest
extent permitted by law, the amount of any interest, fee or other amount payable
hereunder by such Borrower that is not paid when due, from the date such amount
shall be due until such amount shall be paid in full, payable in arrears on the
date such amount shall be paid in full and on demand, at a rate per annum equal
at all times to 1% per annum above the rate per annum required to be paid on
such Revolving Credit Advance pursuant to clause (a)(i) or (a)(ii) above.

          SECTION 2.08. Interest Rate Determination. (a) Each Reference Bank
agrees to furnish to the Agent timely information for the purpose of determining
each Eurocurrency Rate and each LIBO Rate if the applicable Telerate Page is
unavailable. If any one or more of the Reference Banks shall not furnish such
timely information to the Agent for the purpose of determining any such interest
rate, the Agent shall determine such interest rate on the basis of timely
information furnished by the remaining Reference Banks. The Agent shall give
prompt notice to the Company and the Lenders of the applicable interest rate
determined by the Agent


                                       27




<PAGE>

for purposes of Section 2.07(a)(i) or (ii), and the rate, if any, furnished by
each Reference Bank for the purpose of determining the interest rate under
Section 2.07(a)(ii).

          (b) If, with respect to any Eurocurrency Rate Advances, the Majority
Lenders notify the Agent that (i) they are unable to obtain matching deposits in
the London interbank market at or about 11:00 A.M. (London time) on the second
Business Day before the making of a Borrowing in sufficient amounts to fund
their respective Revolving Credit Advances as part of such Borrowing during its
Interest Period or (ii) the Eurocurrency Rate for any Interest Period for such
Advances will not adequately reflect the cost to such Majority Lenders of
making, funding or maintaining their respective Eurocurrency Rate Advances for
such Interest Period, the Agent shall forthwith so notify each Borrower and the
Lenders, whereupon (A) the Borrower will, on the last day of the then existing
Interest Period therefor, (1) if such Eurocurrency Rate Advances are denominated
in Dollars, either (x) prepay such Advances or (y) Convert such Advances into
Base Rate Advances and (2) if such Eurocurrency Rate Advances are denominated in
any Major Currency, either (x) prepay such Advances or (y) redenominate such
Advances into an Equivalent amount of Dollars and Convert such Advances into
Base Rate Advances, and (B) the obligation of the Lenders to make Eurocurrency
Rate Advances in the same currency as such Eurocurrency Rate Advances shall be
suspended until the Agent shall notify each Borrower and the Lenders that the
circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist.

          (c) If any Borrower, in requesting a Revolving Credit Borrowing
comprised of Eurocurrency Rate Advances, shall fail to select the duration of
the Interest Period for such Eurocurrency Rate Advances in accordance with the
provisions contained in the definition of "Interest Period" in Section 1.01, the
Agent will forthwith so notify the Borrower and the Lenders and such Advances
will (to the extent such Eurocurrency Rate Advances remain outstanding on such
day) automatically, on the last day of the then existing Interest Period
therefor, (i) if such Eurocurrency Rate Advances are denominated in Dollars,
Convert into Base Rate Advances and (ii) if such Eurocurrency Rate Advances are
denominated in any Major Currency, be redenominated into an Equivalent amount of
Dollars and be Converted into Base Rate Advances.

          (d) Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of
Default under Section 6.01(a), (i) each Eurocurrency Rate Advance will (to the
extent such Eurocurrency Rate Advance remains outstanding on such day)
automatically, on the last day of the then existing Interest Period therefor,
(A) if such Eurocurrency Rate Advance is denominated in Dollars, be Converted
into a Base Rate Advance and (B) if such Eurocurrency Rate Advance is
denominated in any Major Currency, be redenominated into an Equivalent amount of
Dollars and Converted into a Base Rate Advance and (ii) the obligation of the
Lenders to make Eurocurrency Rate Advances shall be suspended.

          (e) If the applicable Telerate Page is unavailable and fewer than two
Reference Banks furnish timely information to the Agent for determining the
Eurocurrency Rate or LIBO Rate for any Eurocurrency Rate Advances or LIBO Rate
Advances, as the case may be,


                                       28




<PAGE>

          (i) the Agent shall forthwith notify the relevant Borrower and the
     Lenders that the interest rate cannot be determined for such Eurocurrency
     Rate Advances or LIBO Rate Advances, as the case may be,

          (ii) with respect to Eurocurrency Rate Advances, each such Advance
     will (to the extent such Eurocurrency Rate Advance remains outstanding on
     such day) automatically, on the last day of the then existing Interest
     Period therefor, (A) if such Eurocurrency Rate Advance is denominated in
     Dollars, be prepaid by the applicable Borrower or be automatically
     Converted into a Base Rate Advance and (B) if such Eurocurrency Rate
     Advance is denominated in any Major Currency, be prepaid by the applicable
     Borrower or be automatically redenominated into an Equivalent amount of
     Dollars and Converted into a Base Rate Advance (or if such Advance is then
     a Base Rate Advance, will continue as a Base Rate Advance), and

          (iii) the obligation of the Lenders to make Eurocurrency Rate Advances
     or LIBO Rate Advances shall be suspended until the Agent shall notify the
     Borrowers and the Lenders that the circumstances causing such suspension no
     longer exist.

          SECTION 2.09. Prepayments of Revolving Credit Advances. (a) Optional
Prepayments. Each Borrower may, upon notice to the Agent stating the proposed
date and aggregate principal amount of the prepayment, given not later than
11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the second Business Day prior to the date of
such proposed prepayment, in the case of Eurocurrency Rate Advances, and not
later than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the day of such proposed
prepayment, in the case of Base Rate Advances, and, if such notice is given,
such Borrower shall, prepay the outstanding principal amount of the Revolving
Credit Advances comprising part of the same Revolving Credit Borrowing in whole
or ratably in part, together with accrued interest to the date of such
prepayment on the principal amount prepaid; provided, however, that (x) each
partial prepayment shall be in an aggregate principal amount not less than
$10,000,000 or the Equivalent thereof in a Major Currency (determined on the
date notice of prepayment is given) or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 or the
Equivalent thereof in a Major Currency (determined on the date notice of
prepayment is given) in excess thereof and (y) in the event of any such
prepayment of a Eurocurrency Rate Advance other than on the last day of the
Interest Period therefor, such Borrower shall be obligated to reimburse the
Lenders in respect thereof pursuant to Section 9.04(c). Each notice of
prepayment by a Designated Subsidiary shall be given to the Administrative Agent
through the Company.

          (b) Mandatory Prepayments. (i) If, on any date, the sum of (A) the
aggregate principal amount of all Advances denominated in Dollars then
outstanding plus (B) the Equivalent in Dollars (determined on the third Business
Day prior to such date) of the aggregate principal amount of all Advances
denominated in Foreign Currencies then outstanding exceeds 103% of the aggregate
Commitments of the Lenders on such date, the Company and each other Borrower, if
any, shall thereupon promptly prepay the outstanding principal amount of any
Advances owing by such Borrower in an aggregate amount sufficient to reduce such
sum to an amount not to exceed 100% of the aggregate Commitments of the Lenders
on such date, together with any interest accrued to the date of such prepayment
on the principal amounts prepaid and, in the case of any prepayment of a
Eurocurrency Rate Advance, a LIBO Rate Advance or a Local Rate Advance on a date
other than the last day of an Interest Period or at its maturity, any


                                       29




<PAGE>

additional amounts which such Borrower shall be obligated to reimburse to the
Lenders in respect thereof pursuant to Section 9.04(c). The Agent shall give
prompt notice of any prepayment required under this Section 2.09(b)(i) to the
Borrowers and the Lenders.

          (ii) If, on any date, the sum of (A) the Equivalent in Dollars of the
aggregate principal amount of all Eurocurrency Rate Advances denominated in
Major Currencies then outstanding plus (B) the Equivalent in Dollars of the
aggregate principal amount of all Competitive Bid Advances denominated in
Foreign Currencies then outstanding, shall exceed 110% of $500,000,000, the
Company and each other Borrower shall prepay the outstanding principal amount of
any such Eurocurrency Rate Advances or any such LIBO Rate Advances owing by such
Borrower, on the last day of the Interest Periods relating to such Advances, in
an aggregate amount sufficient to reduce such sum to an amount not to exceed
$500,000,000, together with any interest accrued to the date of such prepayment
on the principal amounts prepaid. The Agent shall give prompt notice of any
prepayment required under this Section 2.09(b)(ii) to the Borrowers and the
Lenders.

          SECTION 2.10. Increased Costs. (a) If, due to either (i) the
introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation of any law or
regulation or (ii) the compliance with any guideline or request from any central
bank or other governmental authority including, without limitation, any agency
of the European Union or similar monetary or multinational authority (whether or
not having the force of law), there shall be any increase in the cost to any
Lender of agreeing to make or making, funding or maintaining Eurocurrency Rate
Advances or LIBO Rate Advances (excluding for purposes of this Section 2.10 any
such increased costs resulting from (i) Taxes or Other Taxes (as to which
Section 2.13 shall govern) and (ii) changes in the basis of taxation of overall
net income or overall gross income by the United States or by the foreign
jurisdiction or state under the laws of which such Lender is organized or has
its Applicable Lending Office or any political subdivision thereof), then the
Borrower of such Advances shall from time to time, upon demand by such Lender
(with a copy of such demand to the Agent), pay to the Agent for the account of
such Lender additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Lender for such
increased cost. A certificate as to the amount of such increased cost, submitted
to such Borrower and the Agent by such Lender, shall be conclusive and binding
for all purposes, absent manifest error.

          (b) If any Lender determines that compliance with any law or
regulation or any guideline or request from any central bank or other
governmental authority including, without limitation, any agency of the European
Union or similar monetary or multinational authority (whether or not having the
force of law) affects or would affect the amount of capital required or expected
to be maintained by such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender and
that the amount of such capital is increased by or based upon the existence of
such Lender's commitment to lend hereunder and other commitments of this type,
then, upon demand by such Lender (with a copy of such demand to the Agent), the
Company shall pay to the Agent for the account of such Lender, from time to time
as specified by such Lender, additional amounts sufficient to compensate such
Lender or such corporation in the light of such circumstances, to the extent
that such Lender reasonably determines such increase in capital to be allocable
to the existence of such Lender's commitment to lend hereunder. A certificate as
to such amounts submitted to the Company and the Agent by such Lender shall be
conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.


                                       30




<PAGE>

          (c) Any Lender claiming any additional amounts payable pursuant to
this Section 2.10 shall, upon the written request of the Company delivered to
such Lender and the Agent, assign, pursuant to and in accordance with the
provisions of Section 9.07, all of its rights and obligations under this
Agreement and under the Notes to an Eligible Assignee selected by the Company;
provided, however, that (i) no Default shall have occurred and be continuing at
the time of such request and at the time of such assignment; (ii) the assignee
shall have paid to the assigning Lender the aggregate principal amount of, and
any interest accrued and unpaid to the date of such assignment on, the Note or
Notes of such Lender; (iii) the Company shall have paid to the assigning Lender
any and all facility fees and other fees payable to such Lender and all other
accrued and unpaid amounts owing to such Lender under any provision of this
Agreement (including, but not limited to, any increased costs or other
additional amounts owing under this Section 2.10, and any indemnification for
Taxes under Section 2.13) as of the effective date of such assignment and (iv)
if the assignee selected by the Company is not an existing Lender, such assignee
or the Company shall have paid the processing and recordation fee required under
Section 9.07(a) for such assignment; provided further that the assigning
Lender's rights under Sections 2.10, 2.13 and 9.04, and its obligations under
Section 8.05, shall survive such assignment as to matters occurring prior to the
date of assignment.

          SECTION 2.11. Illegality. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, if any Lender shall notify the Agent that the introduction of or any
change in or in the interpretation of any law or regulation makes it unlawful,
or any central bank or other governmental authority asserts that it is unlawful,
for any Lender or its Eurocurrency Lending Office to perform its obligations
hereunder to make Eurocurrency Rate Advances in Dollars or any Major Currency or
LIBO Rate Advances in Dollars or in any Foreign Currency or to fund or maintain
Eurocurrency Rate Advances in Dollars or in any Major Currency or LIBO Rate
Advances in Dollars or in any Foreign Currency hereunder, (a) each such
Eurocurrency Rate Advance or such LIBO Rate Advance, as the case may be, will
automatically, upon such demand, (i) if such Eurocurrency Rate Advance or LIBO
Rate Advance is denominated in Dollars, be Converted into a Base Rate Advance or
an Advance that bears interest at the rate set forth in Section 2.07(a)(i), as
the case may be, and (ii) if such Eurocurrency Rate Advance or LIBO Rate Advance
is denominated in any Foreign Currency, be redenominated into an Equivalent
amount of Dollars and Converted into a Base Rate Advance or an Advance that
bears interest at the rate set forth in Section 2.07(a)(i), as the case may be,
and (b) the obligation of the Lenders to make such Eurocurrency Rate Advances or
such LIBO Rate Advances shall be suspended until the Agent shall notify the
Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances causing such suspension no
longer exist.

          SECTION 2.12. Payments and Computations. (a) Each Borrower shall make
each payment hereunder and under any Notes, except with respect to principal of,
interest on, and other amounts relating to, Advances denominated in a Foreign
Currency, not later than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the day when due in
Dollars to the Agent at the applicable Agent's Account in same day funds. Each
Borrower shall make each payment hereunder and under any Notes with respect to
principal of, interest on, and other amounts relating to Advances denominated in
a Foreign Currency not later than 12:00 Noon (at the Payment Office for such
Foreign Currency) on the day when due in such Foreign Currency to the Agent in
same day funds by deposit of such funds to the applicable Agent's Account. The
Agent will promptly thereafter cause to be distributed like funds relating to
the payment of principal or interest or


                                       31




<PAGE>

facility fees ratably (other than amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.03,
2.05(b), 2.05(c), 2.10, 2.13, 2.16 or 9.04(c)) to the Lenders for the account of
their respective Applicable Lending Offices, and like funds relating to the
payment of any other amount payable to any Lender to such Lender for the account
of its Applicable Lending Office, in each case to be applied in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement. Upon its acceptance of an Assignment and Acceptance
and recording of the information contained therein in the Register pursuant to
Section 9.07(c), from and after the effective date specified in such Assignment
and Acceptance, the Agent shall make all payments hereunder and under any Notes
in respect of the interest assigned thereby to the Lender assignee thereunder,
and the parties to such Assignment and Acceptance shall make all appropriate
adjustments in such payments for periods prior to such effective date directly
between themselves. Upon any Assuming Lender becoming a Lender hereunder as a
result of the effectiveness of an extension of the Termination Date pursuant to
Section 2.16, and upon the Agent's receipt of such Lender's Assumption Agreement
and recording the information contained therein in the Register, from and after
the Increase Date or the Extension Date, as the case may be, the Agent shall
make all payments hereunder and under any Notes in respect of the interest
assumed thereby to the Assuming Lender.

          (b) All computations of interest based on the Base Rate and of
facility fees shall be made by the Agent on the basis of a year of 365 or 366
days, as the case may be, all computations of interest based on the Eurocurrency
Rate or the Federal Funds Rate shall be made by the Agent on the basis of a year
of 360 days and all computations in respect of Competitive Bid Advances shall be
made by the Agent or the Sub-Agent, as the case may be, as specified in the
applicable Notice of Competitive Bid Borrowing (or, in each case of Advances
denominated in Foreign Currencies where market practice differs, in accordance
with market practice), in each case for the actual number of days (including the
first day but excluding the last day) occurring in the period for which such
interest or facility fees are payable. Each determination by the Agent of an
interest rate hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent
manifest error.

          (c) Whenever any payment hereunder or under the Notes shall be stated
to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the
next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be
included in the computation of payment of interest or facility fee, as the case
may be; provided, however, that, if such extension would cause payment of
interest on or principal of Eurocurrency Rate Advances or LIBO Rate Advances to
be made in the next following calendar month, such payment shall be made on the
next preceding Business Day.

          (d) Unless the Agent shall have received notice from any Borrower
prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Lenders hereunder that such
Borrower will not make such payment in full, the Agent may assume that such
Borrower has made such payment in full to the Agent on such date and the Agent
may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each Lender on
such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Lender. If and to the
extent such Borrower shall not have so made such payment in full to the Agent,
each Lender shall repay to the Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed
to such Lender together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such
amount is distributed to such Lender until the date such Lender repays such
amount to the Agent, at (i) the Federal


                                       32




<PAGE>

Funds Rate in the case of Advances denominated in Dollars or (ii) the cost of
funds incurred by the Agent in respect of such amount in the case of Advances
denominated in Foreign Currencies.

          SECTION 2.13. Taxes. (a) Any and all payments by any Borrower
(including the Company in its capacity as a guarantor under Article VII hereof)
hereunder or under the Notes shall be made, in accordance with Section 2.12,
free and clear of and without deduction for any and all present or future taxes,
levies, imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings, and all liabilities with
respect thereto, excluding, in the case of each Lender and the Agent, net income
taxes imposed by the United States and taxes imposed on its overall net income,
and franchise taxes imposed on it in lieu of net income taxes, by the
jurisdiction under the laws of which such Lender or the Agent (as the case may
be) is organized or any political subdivision thereof and, in the case of each
Lender, taxes imposed on its overall net income, and franchise taxes imposed on
it in lieu of net income taxes, by the jurisdiction of such Lender's Applicable
Lending Office or any political subdivision thereof (all such non-excluded
taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges, withholdings and liabilities in
respect of payments hereunder or under the Notes being hereinafter referred to
as "Taxes"). If any Borrower (including the Company in its capacity as a
guarantor under Article VII hereof) shall be required by law to deduct any Taxes
from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder or under any Note to any Lender
or the Agent, (i) the sum payable shall be increased as may be necessary so that
after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to
additional sums payable under this Section 2.13) such Lender or the Agent (as
the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had
no such deductions been made, (ii) such Borrower shall make such deductions and
(iii) such Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant taxation
authority or other authority in accordance with applicable law.

          (b) In addition, each Borrower agrees to pay any present or future
stamp or documentary taxes or any other excise or property taxes, charges or
similar levies that arise from any payment made hereunder or under the Notes or
from the execution, delivery or registration of, performing under, or otherwise
with respect to, this Agreement or the Notes (hereinafter referred to as "Other
Taxes").

          (c) Each Borrower shall indemnify each Lender and the Agent for the
full amount of Taxes or Other Taxes (including, without limitation, any taxes
imposed by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this Section 2.13) imposed
on or paid by such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) and any liability
(including penalties, interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect
thereto; provided, however, that a Borrower shall not be obligated to pay any
amounts in respect of penalties, interest or expenses pursuant to this paragraph
that are payable solely as a result of (i) the failure on the part of the
pertinent Lender or the Agent to pay over those amounts received from the
Borrowers under this clause (c) or (ii) the gross negligence or willful
misconduct on the part of the pertinent Lender or the Agent. This
indemnification shall be made within 30 days from the date such Lender or the
Agent (as the case may be) makes written demand therefor. Each Lender agrees to
provide reasonably prompt notice to the Agent, the Company and any Borrower of
any imposition of Taxes or Other Taxes against such Lender; provided that
failure to give such notice shall not affect such Lender's rights to
indemnification hereunder. Each Lender agrees that it will, promptly upon a
request by the Company or a Borrower having made an indemnification payment
hereunder, furnish to the Company or such Borrower, as the case may be, such
evidence as is reasonably available to such


                                       33




<PAGE>

Lender as to the payment of the relevant Taxes or Other Taxes, and that it will,
if requested by the Company or such Borrower, cooperate with the Company or such
Borrower, as the case may be, in its efforts to obtain a refund or similar
relief in respect of such payment.

          (d) Within 30 days after the date of any payment of Taxes, each
Borrower shall furnish to the Agent, at its address referred to in Section 9.02,
the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof. In the
case of any payment hereunder or under the Notes by or on behalf of any Borrower
through an account or branch outside the United States or by or on behalf of any
Borrower by a payor that is not a United States person, if such Borrower
determines that no Taxes are payable in respect thereof, such Borrower shall
furnish, or shall cause such payor to furnish, to the Agent, at such address, an
opinion of counsel acceptable to the Agent stating that such payment is exempt
from Taxes. For purposes of this subsection (d) and subsection (e), the terms
"United States" and "United States person" shall have the meanings specified in
Section 7701 of the Internal Revenue Code.

          (e) Each Lender organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside the
United States, on or prior to the date of its execution and delivery of this
Agreement in the case of each Initial Lender and on the date of the Assignment
and Acceptance or the Assumption Agreement, as the case may be, pursuant to
which it becomes a Lender in the case of each other Lender, and from time to
time thereafter as requested in writing by any Borrower (but only so long as
such Lender remains lawfully able to do so), shall provide the Agent and each
Borrower with two original Internal Revenue Service forms W-8ECI or W-8BEN, as
appropriate, or any successor or other form prescribed by the Internal Revenue
Service, certifying that such Lender is exempt from or entitled to a reduced
rate of United States withholding tax on payments pursuant to this Agreement or
the Notes. In addition, each Lender further agrees to provide any Borrower with
any form or document as any Borrower may request which is required by any taxing
authority outside the United States in order to secure an exemption from, or
reduction in the rate of, withholding tax. If the forms provided by a Lender at
the time such Lender first becomes a party to this Agreement indicates a United
States interest withholding tax rate in excess of zero, withholding tax at such
rate shall be considered excluded from Taxes unless and until such Lender
provides the appropriate forms certifying that a lesser rate applies, whereupon
withholding tax at such lesser rate only shall be considered excluded from Taxes
for periods governed by such form; provided, however, that, if at the date of
the Assignment and Acceptance or the Assumption Agreement, as the case may be,
pursuant to which a Lender becomes a party to this Agreement, such Lender was
entitled to payments under subsection (a) in respect of United States
withholding tax with respect to interest paid at such date, then, to such
extent, the term Taxes shall include (in addition to withholding taxes that may
be imposed in the future or other amounts otherwise includable in Taxes) United
States withholding tax, if any, applicable with respect to such Lender on such
date. If any form or document referred to in this subsection (e) requires the
disclosure of information, other than information necessary to compute the tax
payable and information required on the date hereof by Internal Revenue Service
form W-8ECI or W-8BEN, that a Lender reasonably considers to be confidential,
such Lender shall give notice thereof to each Borrower and shall not be
obligated to include in such form or document such confidential information.

          (f) For any period with respect to which a Lender has failed to
provide each Borrower with the appropriate form described in Section 2.13(e)
(other than if such failure is due


                                       34




<PAGE>

to a change in law occurring subsequent to the date on which a form originally
was required to be provided, or if such form otherwise is not required under the
first sentence of subsection (e) above), such Lender shall not be entitled to
indemnification under Section 2.13(a) or (c) with respect to Taxes imposed by
the United States by reason of such failure; provided, however, that should a
Lender become subject to Taxes because of its failure to deliver a form required
hereunder, each Borrower shall take such steps as such Lender shall reasonably
request to assist such Lender to recover such Taxes.

          (g) If any Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any
Lender or to the Agent or on behalf of any of them to any taxing authority
pursuant to this Section 2.13, such Lender shall, upon the written request of
the Company delivered to such Lender and the Agent, assign, pursuant to and in
accordance with the provisions of Section 9.07, all of its rights and
obligations under this Agreement and under the Notes to an Eligible Assignee
selected by the Company; provided, however, that (i) no Default shall have
occurred and be continuing at the time of such request and at the time of such
assignment; (ii) the assignee shall have paid to the assigning Lender the
aggregate principal amount of, and any interest accrued and unpaid to the date
of such assignment on, the Note or Notes of such Lender; (iii) the Company shall
have paid to the assigning Lender any and all facility fees and other fees
payable to such Lender and all other accrued and unpaid amounts owing to such
Lender under any provision of this Agreement (including, but not limited to, any
increased costs or other additional amounts owing under Section 2.10, and any
indemnification for Taxes under this Section 2.13) as of the effective date of
such assignment; and (iv) if the assignee selected by the Company is not an
existing Lender, such assignee or the Company shall have paid the processing and
recordation fee required under Section 9.07(a) for such assignment; provided
further that the assigning Lender's rights under Sections 2.10, 2.13 and 9.04,
and its obligations under Section 8.05, shall survive such assignment as to
matters occurring prior to the date of assignment.

          SECTION 2.14. Sharing of Payments, Etc. If any Lender shall obtain any
payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of
setoff, or otherwise) on account of the Revolving Credit Advances owing to it
(other than pursuant to Section 2.03, 2.05(b), 2.05(c), 2.10, 2.13, 2.16 or
9.04(c)) in excess of its ratable share of payments on account of the Revolving
Credit Advances obtained by all the Lenders, such Lender shall forthwith
purchase from the other Lenders such participations in the Revolving Credit
Advances owing to them as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to
share the excess payment ratably with each of them; provided, however, that if
all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from such
purchasing Lender, such purchase from each Lender shall be rescinded and such
Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the purchase price to the extent of
such recovery together with an amount equal to such Lender's ratable share
(according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such Lender's required
repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender) of
any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect
of the total amount so recovered. Each Borrower agrees that any Lender so
purchasing a participation from another Lender pursuant to this Section 2.14
may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment
(including the right of setoff) with respect to such participation as fully as
if such Lender were the direct creditor of such Borrower in the amount of such
participation.


                                       35




<PAGE>

          SECTION 2.15. Use of Proceeds. The proceeds of the Advances shall be
available (and each Borrower agrees that it shall use such proceeds) for general
corporate purposes of such Borrower and its Subsidiaries, including, without
limitation, backstop of commercial paper.

          SECTION 2.16. Extension of Termination Date. (a) At least 45 (but no
earlier than 60) days prior to the Termination Date then in effect and provided
all representations and warranties are true and correct in all material respects
and no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Company may, at its
option, by written notice to the Agent, request that the Lenders extend the
Termination Date for an additional 364 days from the Termination Date then in
effect; provided, however, that the Company shall not have made the Term Loan
Election for Revolving Credit Advances outstanding on such Termination Date
prior to such time. Each Lender, in its sole discretion, shall consent or not
consent to such extension and shall notify the Agent of its consent or
nonconsent to such extension within 20 Business Days of notice of such request
from the Agent. If all of the Lenders consent in writing, the then applicable
Termination Date shall, effective as at such Termination Date (the "Extension
Date"), be extended for a period of 364 days from such Extension Date.

          (b) If not all of the Lenders consent, pursuant to subsection (a) of
this Section 2.16, to an extension of the Termination Date then in effect (the
Lenders so consenting in writing being the "Consenting Lenders", and any Lender
not so consenting being a "Non-Consenting Lender"), the Company may:

          (i) arrange for one or more Consenting Lenders or other Eligible
     Assignees as Assuming Lenders to assume, effective on the Extension Date,
     any Non-Consenting Lender's Commitment and all of the obligations of such
     Lender under this Agreement thereafter arising, and effective on such
     Extension Date, each such Consenting Lender or such Assuming Lender will be
     substituted for such Non-Consenting Lender under this Agreement; provided,
     however, that the amount of the Commitment of any such Assuming Lender as a
     result of such substitution shall in no event be less than $10,000,000;
     provided further that (i) any such Consenting Lender or Assuming Lender
     shall have paid to such Non-Consenting Lender the aggregate principal
     amount of, and any interest accrued and unpaid to the date of the
     assignment on, the Advances of such Non-Consenting Lender; (ii) the Company
     shall have paid to such Non-Consenting Lender any and all facility fees and
     other fees payable to such Non-Consenting Lender and all other accrued and
     unpaid amounts owing to such Non-Consenting Lender under any provision of
     this Agreement (including, but not limited to, any increased costs or other
     additional amounts owing under Section 2.10, and any indemnification for
     Taxes under this Section 2.13) as of the effective date of such assignment;
     and (iii) with respect to any such Assuming Lender, such Assuming Lender or
     the Company shall have paid the applicable processing and recordation fee
     required under Section 9.07(a) for such assignment; provided further that
     such Non-Consenting Lender's rights under Sections 2.10, 2.13 and 9.04, and
     its obligations under Section 8.05, shall survive such substitution as to
     matters occurring prior to the date of substitution; provided further that,
     on or prior to the tenth day prior to the Extension Date, (x) any such
     Assuming Lender shall have delivered to the Company and the Agent an
     Assumption Agreement in substantially the form of Exhibit D hereto, duly
     executed by such Assuming Lender, such Non-Consenting


                                       36




<PAGE>

     Lender and the Company, (y) any such Consenting Bank shall have delivered
     confirmation in writing satisfactory to the Agent as to its increased
     Commitment and (z) each Non-Consenting Lender being replaced pursuant to
     this clause (i) shall have delivered to the Agent any Revolving Credit Note
     or Notes held by such Non-Consenting Lender; and provided further that, if
     requested by any Assuming Lender, each Borrower, at its own expense, shall
     have executed and delivered to the Agent no later than 10:00 A.M. (New York
     City time) on the Extension Date, Revolving Credit Notes payable to the
     order of each such Assuming Lender, if any, dated as of the Extension Date
     and substantially in the form of Exhibit A-1 hereto; or

          (ii) subject to the giving of notice to such Non-Consenting Lender at
     least four days prior to the Extension Date, pay, prepay or cause to be
     prepaid, on and effective as of the Extension Date, all principal of, and
     interest accrued to the date of such payment on, Advances and all other
     amounts owing to such Non-Consenting Lender hereunder (including, but not
     limited to, any increased costs or other additional amounts owing under
     Section 2.10 and any indemnification for Taxes under Section 2.13) and
     terminate in whole any Non-Consenting Lender's Commitment, notwithstanding
     the provisions of Section 2.05; and, upon such payment or prepayment, the
     obligations of such Non-Consenting Lender hereunder shall, by the
     provisions hereof, be released and discharged; provided, however, that such
     Non-Consenting Lender's rights under Sections 2.10, 2.13 and 9.04, and its
     obligations under Section 8.05 shall survive such release and discharge as
     to matters occurring prior to the Extension Date.

          (c) In the event that, on or prior to the then applicable Extension
Date, all Non-Consenting Lenders shall have been superseded by Consenting
Lenders or Assuming Lenders or shall have had their Commitments terminated
pursuant to subsection (b)(i) or (b)(ii) above, the Termination Date then in
effect shall be extended for the additional one-year period as described in
subsection (a) above, each Non-Consenting Lender shall have no further
Commitment hereunder, and each Assuming Lender, if any, shall thereafter be
substituted as a party to this Agreement and be a Lender for the purposes of
this Agreement, without any further acknowledgment by or the consent of the
Lenders. The Agent shall thereupon promptly deliver the new Revolving Credit
Notes to the respective Assuming Lenders requesting such Notes and record in the
Register the relevant information with respect to each Consenting Lender and
each such Assuming Lender.

          (d) In the event that (x) as to a Non-Consenting Lender, neither
procedure contemplated by subsection (b)(i) or (b)(ii) above is implemented in a
timely basis or (y) the Company shall, by written notice to the Agent at least
four days prior to the Extension Date, withdraw its request for the extension of
the Termination Date then in effect, such request by the Company shall be deemed
not to have been made, all actions theretofore taken under subsection (b)(i) or
(b)(ii) above shall be deemed to be of no effect, the Agent shall return any
Revolving Credit Notes received from any Non-Consenting Lender to such
Non-Consenting Lender and all the rights and obligations of the parties shall
continue as if no such request had been made.

          SECTION 2.17. Evidence of Debt. (a) Each Lender shall maintain in
accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the
indebtedness of each Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Revolving
Credit Advance owing to such Lender


                                       37




<PAGE>

from time to time, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and
paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder in respect of Revolving Credit
Advances. Each Borrower agrees that upon request of any Lender to such Borrower
(with a copy of such notice to the Agent) that such Lender receive a Revolving
Credit Note to evidence (whether for purposes of pledge, enforcement or
otherwise) the Revolving Credit Advances owing to, or to be made by, such
Lender, such Borrower shall promptly execute and deliver to such Lender a
Revolving Credit Note payable to the order of such Lender in a principal amount
up to the Commitment of such Lender.

          (b) The Register maintained by the Agent pursuant to Section 9.07(d)
shall include a control account, and a subsidiary account for each Lender, in
which accounts (taken together) shall be recorded (i) the date and amount of
each Borrowing made hereunder, the Type of Advances comprising such Borrowing
and, if appropriate, the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the terms of
each Assumption Agreement and each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to and
accepted by it, (iii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or
to become due and payable from each Borrower to each Lender hereunder and (iv)
the amount of any sum received by the Agent from each Borrower hereunder and
each Lender's share thereof.

          (c) Entries made in good faith by the Agent in the Register pursuant
to subsection (b) above, and by each Lender in its account or accounts pursuant
to subsection (a) above, shall be prima facie evidence of the amount of
principal and interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the
Borrowers to, in the case of the Register, each Lender and, in the case of such
account or accounts, such Lender, under this Agreement, absent manifest error;
provided, however, that the failure of the Agent or such Lender to make an
entry, or any finding that an entry is incorrect, in the Register or such
account or accounts shall not limit or otherwise affect the obligations of any
Borrower under this Agreement.

          (g) Following application of the proceeds of each Advance, not more
     than 25 percent of the value of the assets (either of the Borrower of such
     Advance or of such Borrower and its Subsidiaries on a Consolidated basis)
     subject to the provisions of Section 5.02(a) or subject to any restriction
     contained in any agreement or instrument between such Borrower and any
     Lender or any Affiliate of any Lender relating to Debt and within the scope
     of Section 6.01(e) will be margin stock (within the meaning of Regulation U
     issued by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System).

          (h) The Company and each wholly-owned direct Subsidiary of the Company
     have, in the aggregate, met their minimum funding requirements under ERISA
     with respect to their Plans in all material respects and have not incurred
     any material liability to the PBGC, other than for the payment of premiums,
     in connection with such Plans.

          (i) No ERISA Event has occurred or is reasonably expected to occur
     with respect to any Plan of the Company or any of its ERISA Affiliates that
     has resulted in or is reasonably likely to result in a material liability
     of the Company or any of its ERISA Affiliates.

          (j) The Schedules B (Actuarial Information) to the 2001 annual reports
     (Form 5500 Series) with respect to each Plan of the Company or any of its
     ERISA Affiliates, copies of which have been filed with the Internal Revenue
     Service (and which will be furnished to any Bank through the Administrative
     Agent upon the request of such Bank through the Administrative Agent to the
     Company), are complete and accurate in all material respects and fairly
     present in all material respects the funding status of such Plans at such
     date, and since the date of each such Schedule B there has been no material
     adverse change in funding status.

          (k) Neither the Company nor any of its ERISA Affiliates has incurred
     or reasonably expects to incur any Withdrawal Liability to any
     Multiemployer Plan in an annual amount exceeding 6% of Net Tangible Assets
     of the Company and its Consolidated Subsidiaries.

          (l) Neither the Company nor any of its ERISA Affiliates has been
     notified by the sponsor of a Multiemployer Plan that such Multiemployer
     Plan is in reorganization or has been terminated, within the meaning of
     Title IV of ERISA. No such Multiemployer Plan is reasonably expected to be
     in reorganization or to be terminated, within the meaning of Title IV of
     ERISA, in a reorganization or termination which might reasonably be
     expected to result in a liability of the Company in an amount in excess of
     $5,000,000.

          (m) The Company is not, and immediately after the application by the
     Company of the proceeds of each Loan will not be, (a) an "investment
     company" within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as
     amended, or (b) a "holding company" within the meaning of the Public
     Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended.

          (n) To the best of the Company's knowledge, the operations and
     properties of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole comply in
     all material respects with all Environmental Laws, all necessary
     Environmental Permits have been applied for or have been obtained and are
     in effect for the operations and properties of the Company and its
     Subsidiaries and the Company and its Subsidiaries are in compliance in all


                                       44




<PAGE>

     material respects with all such Environmental Permits. To the best of the
     Company's knowledge no circumstances exist that would be reasonably likely
     to form the basis of an Environmental Action against the Company or any of
     its Subsidiaries or any of their properties that could have a Material
     Adverse Effect.

     consecutive days during which a stay of enforcement of such judgment or
     order, by reason of a pending appeal or otherwise, shall not be in effect;
     provided, however, that any such judgment or order shall not be an Event of

                                   GUARANTEE

          SECTION 7.01. Unconditional Guarantee. For valuable consideration,
receipt whereof is hereby acknowledged, and to induce each Lender to make
Advances to the Designated Subsidiaries and to induce the Agent to act
hereunder, the Company hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees to each
Lender and the Agent that:

          (a) the principal of and interest on each Advance to each Designated
     Subsidiary shall be promptly paid in full when due (whether at stated
     maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) in accordance with the terms
     hereof, and, in case of any extension of time of payment, in whole or in
     part, of such Advance, that all such sums shall be promptly paid when due
     (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) in accordance
     with the terms of such extension; and

          (b) all other amounts payable hereunder by any Designated Subsidiary
     to any Lender or the Agent or the Sub-Agent, as the case may be, shall be
     promptly paid in full when due in accordance with the terms hereof (the
     obligations of the Designated Subsidiaries under these subsections (a) and
     (b) of this Section 7.01 being the "Obligations").

In addition, the Company hereby unconditionally and irrevocably agrees that upon
default in the payment when due (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or
otherwise) of any principal of, or interest on, any Advance to any Designated
Subsidiary or such other amounts payable by any Designated Subsidiary to any
Lender or the Agent, the Company will forthwith pay the same, without further
notice or demand.

          SECTION 7.02. Guarantee Absolute. The Company guarantees that the
Obligations will be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, regardless of any law, regulation or order now or hereafter in effect
in any jurisdiction affecting any of such terms or the rights of any Lender or
the Agent with respect thereto. The liability of the Company under this
guarantee shall be absolute and unconditional irrespective of:

          (a) any lack of validity or enforceability of this Agreement or any
     other agreement or instrument relating thereto;

          (b) any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any
     other term of, all or any of the Obligations, or any other amendment or
     waiver of or any consent to departure from this Agreement (including,
     without limitation, any extension of the Termination Date pursuant to
     Section 2.16);

          (c) any exchange, release or non-perfection of any collateral, or any
     release or amendment or waiver of or consent to departure from any other
     guaranty, for all or any of the Obligations; or

          (d) any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a defense
     available to, or a discharge of, the Company, any Borrower or a guarantor.


                                       54




<PAGE>

This guarantee shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may
be, if at any time any payment of any of the Obligations is rescinded or must
otherwise be returned by any of the Lenders or the Agent upon the insolvency,
bankruptcy or reorganization of the Company or any Borrower or otherwise, all as
though such payment had not been made.

          SECTION 7.03. Waivers. The Company hereby expressly waives diligence,
presentment, demand for payment, protest, any requirement that any right or
power be exhausted or any action be taken against any Designated Subsidiary or
against any other guarantor of all or any portion of the Advances, and all other
notices and demands whatsoever.

          SECTION 7.04. Remedies. Each of the Lenders and the Agent may pursue
its respective rights and remedies under this Article VII and shall be entitled
to payment hereunder notwithstanding any other guarantee of all or any part of
the Advances to the Designated Subsidiaries, and notwithstanding any action
taken by any such Lender or the Agent to enforce any of its rights or remedies
under such other guarantee, or any payment received thereunder. The Company
hereby irrevocably waives any claim or other right that it may now or hereafter
acquire against any Designated Subsidiary that arises from the existence,
payment, performance or enforcement of the Company's obligations under this
Article VII, including, without limitation, any right of subrogation,
reimbursement, exoneration, contribution or indemnification and any right to
participate in any claim or remedy of the Agent or the Lenders against any
Designated Subsidiary, whether or not such claim, remedy or right arises in
equity or under contract, statute or common law, including, without limitation,
the right to take or receive from the Designated Subsidiary, directly or
indirectly, in cash or other property or by set-off or in any other manner,
payment or security on account of such claim, remedy or right. If any amount
shall be paid to the Company in violation of the preceding sentence at any time
when all the Obligations shall not have been paid in full, such amount shall be
held in trust for the benefit of the Lenders and the Agent and shall forthwith
be paid to the Agent for its own account and the accounts of the respective
Lenders to be credited and applied to the Obligations, whether matured or
unmatured, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, or to be held as
collateral for any Obligations or other amounts payable under this Agreement
thereafter arising. The Company acknowledges that it will receive direct and
indirect benefits from the financing arrangements contemplated by this Agreement
and that the waiver set forth in this section is knowingly made in contemplation
of such benefits.

          SECTION 7.05. No Stay. The Company agrees that, as between (a) the
Company and (b) the Lenders and the Agent, the Obligations of any Designated
Subsidiary guaranteed by the Company hereunder may be declared to be forthwith
due and payable as provided in Article VI hereof for purposes of this Article
VII by declaration to the Company as guarantor notwithstanding any stay,
injunction or other prohibition preventing such declaration as against such
Designated Subsidiary and that, in the event of such declaration to the Company
as guarantor, such Obligations (whether or not due and payable by such
Designated Subsidiary), shall forthwith become due and payable by the Company
for purposes of this Article VII.

          SECTION 7.06. Survival. This guarantee is a continuing guarantee and
shall (a) remain in full force and effect until payment in full (after the
Termination Date) of the Obligations and all other amounts payable under this
guaranty, (b) be binding upon the Company, its successors and assigns, (c) inure
to the benefit of and be enforceable by each


                                       55




<PAGE>

Lender (including each Assuming Lender and each assignee Lender pursuant to
Section 9.07) and the Agent and their respective successors, transferees and
assigns and (d) shall be reinstated if at any time any payment to a Lender or
the Agent hereunder is required to be restored by such Lender or the Agent.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing clause (c), each Lender may
assign or otherwise transfer its interest in any Advance to any other person or
entity, and such other person or entity shall thereupon become vested with all
the rights in respect thereof granted to such Lender herein or otherwise.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                                   THE AGENT

          SECTION 8.01. Authorization and Action. Each Lender hereby appoints
and authorizes the Agent to take such action as agent on its behalf and to
exercise such powers and discretion under this Agreement as are delegated to the
Agent by the terms hereof, together with such powers and discretion as are
reasonably incidental thereto. As to any matters not expressly provided for by
this Agreement (including, without limitation, enforcement or collection of the
Notes), the Agent shall not be required to exercise any discretion or take any
action, but shall be required to act or to refrain from acting (and shall be
fully protected in so acting or refraining from acting) upon the instructions of
the Majority Lenders, and such instructions shall be binding upon all Lenders
and all holders of Notes; provided, however, that the Agent shall not be
required to take any action that exposes the Agent to personal liability or that
is contrary to this Agreement or applicable law. The Agent agrees to give to
each Lender prompt notice of each notice given to it by any Borrower pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement.

          SECTION 8.02. Agent's Reliance, Etc. Neither the Agent nor any of its
directors, officers, agents or employees shall be liable for any action taken or
omitted to be taken by it or them under or in connection with this Agreement,
except for its or their own gross negligence or willful misconduct. Without
limitation of the generality of the foregoing, the Agent: (a) may treat the
Lender that made any Advance as the holder of the Debt resulting therefrom until
the Agent receives and accepts an Assignment and Acceptance entered into by such
Lender, as assignor, and an Eligible Assignee, as assignee, as provided in
Section 9.07; (b) may consult with legal counsel (including counsel for the
Company), independent public accountants and other experts selected by it and
shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken in good faith by
it in accordance with the advice of such counsel, accountants or experts; (c)
makes no warranty or representation to any Lender and shall not be responsible
to any Lender for any statements, warranties or representations (whether written
or oral) made in or in connection with this Agreement; (d) shall not have any
duty to ascertain or to inquire as to the performance or observance of any of
the terms, covenants or conditions of this Agreement on the part of any Borrower
or to inspect the property (including the books and records) of any Borrower;
(e) shall not be responsible to any Lender for the due execution, legality,
validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of this Agreement or
any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto; and (f) shall incur
no liability under or in respect of this Agreement by acting upon any notice,
consent, certificate or other instrument or writing (which may be by telecopier,
telegram or telex) believed by it to be genuine and signed or sent by the proper
party or parties.

the Advances made by it and the Note issued to it, Citibank shall have the same
rights and powers under this Agreement as any other Lender and may exercise the
same as though it were not the Agent; and the term "Lender" or "Lenders" shall,
unless otherwise expressly indicated, include Citibank in its individual
capacity. Citibank and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to,
act as trustee under indentures of, accept investment banking engagements from
and generally engage in any kind of business with, the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries and any Person who may do business with or own securities of the
Company or any such Subsidiary, all as if Citibank were not the Agent and
without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders.

          SECTION 8.04. Lender Credit Decision. Each Lender acknowledges that it
has, independently and without reliance upon the Agent or any other Lender and
based on the financial statements referred to in Section 4.01 and such other
documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit
analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also
acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Agent or
any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall deem
appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or
not taking action under this Agreement.

          SECTION 8.05. Indemnification. The Lenders agree to indemnify the
Agent (to the extent not reimbursed by a Borrower), ratably according to the
respective principal amounts of the Revolving Credit Advances then owed to each
of them (or if no Revolving Credit Advances are at the time outstanding, ratably
according to the respective amounts of their Commitments), from and against any
and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions,
judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature
whatsoever that may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against the Agent in
any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any action taken or
omitted by the Agent under this Agreement, provided that no Lender shall be
liable for any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages,
penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting
from the Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct. Without limitation of
the foregoing, each Lender agrees to reimburse the Agent promptly upon demand
for its ratable share of any out-of-pocket expenses (including counsel fees)
incurred by the Agent in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery,
administration, modification, amendment or enforcement (whether through
negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice in respect of
rights or responsibilities under, this Agreement, to the extent that the Agent
is not reimbursed for such expenses by a Borrower.

          SECTION 8.06. Successor Agent. The Agent may resign at any time by
giving written notice thereof to the Lenders and the Company and may be removed
at any time with or without cause by the Majority Lenders. The Company may at
any time, by notice to the Agent, propose a successor Agent (which shall meet
the criteria described below) specified in such notice and request that the
Lenders be notified thereof by the Agent with a view to their removal of the
Agent and their appointment of such successor Agent; the Agent agrees to forward
any such notice to the Lenders promptly upon its receipt by the Agent. Upon any
such resignation or removal, the Majority Lenders shall have the right to
appoint a successor Agent. If no successor Agent shall have been so appointed by
the Majority Lenders, and shall have accepted such appointment, within 30 days
after the retiring Agent's giving of notice of resignation or the


                                       57




<PAGE>

Majority Lenders' removal of the retiring Agent, then the retiring Agent may, on
behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Agent, which shall be a commercial
bank organized under the laws of the United States of America or of any State
thereof and having a combined capital and surplus of at least $500,000,000. Upon
the acceptance of any appointment as Agent hereunder by a successor Agent, such
successor Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the
rights, powers, discretion, privileges and duties of the retiring Agent, and the
retiring Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations under this
Agreement. After any retiring Agent's resignation or removal hereunder as Agent,
the provisions of this Article VIII shall inure to its benefit as to any actions
taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Agent under this Agreement.

          SECTION 8.07. Sub-Agent. The Sub-Agent has been designated under this
Agreement to carry out duties of the Agent. The Sub-Agent shall be subject to
each of the obligations in this Agreement to be performed by the Sub-Agent, and
each of the Borrowers and the Lenders agrees that the Sub-Agent shall be
entitled to exercise each of the rights and shall be entitled to each of the
benefits of the Agent under this Agreement as relate to the performance of its
obligations hereunder.

                                   ARTICLE IX

                                 MISCELLANEOUS

          SECTION 9.01. Amendments, Etc. No amendment or waiver of any provision
of this Agreement or the Revolving Credit Notes, nor consent to any departure by
any Borrower therefrom, shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be
in writing and signed by the Majority Lenders, and then such waiver or consent
shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose
for which given; provided, however, that no amendment, waiver or consent shall,
unless in writing and signed by all the Lenders, do any of the following: (a)
increase the Commitments of the Lenders or subject the Lenders to any additional
obligations, (b) reduce the principal of, or interest on, the Revolving Credit
Advances or any fees or other amounts payable hereunder, (c) postpone any date
fixed for any payment of principal of, or interest on, the Revolving Credit
Advances or any fees or other amounts payable hereunder (other than as permitted
by Section 2.16 to the extent any Lender consents thereunder), (d) release the
Company from any of its obligations under Article VII, (e) require the duration
of an Interest Period to be nine months if such period is not available to all
Lenders or (f) amend this section 9.01; and provided further that no amendment,
waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by the Agent in addition
to the Lenders required above to take such action, affect the rights or duties
of the Agent under this Agreement or any Note.

          SECTION 9.02. Notices, Etc. All notices and other communications
provided for hereunder shall be in writing (including telecopier, telegraphic or
telex communication) and mailed (return receipt requested), telecopied,

other address as shall be designated by such party in a written notice to the
other parties and, as to each other party, at such other address as shall be

executed counterpart of any amendment or waiver of any provision of this
Agreement or the Notes or of any Exhibit hereto to be executed and delivered
hereunder shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart
thereof.

          SECTION 9.03. No Waiver; Remedies. No failure on the part of any
Lender or the Agent to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right hereunder
or under any Note shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or
partial exercise of any such right preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right. The remedies herein provided are
cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies provided by law.

          SECTION 9.04. Costs and Expenses. (a) The Company agrees to pay on
demand all costs and expenses of the Agent in connection with the
administration, modification and amendment of this Agreement, the Notes and the
other documents to be delivered hereunder, including, without limitation, (i)
all due diligence, syndication (including printing, distribution and bank
meetings), transportation, computer, duplication, appraisal, consultant, and
audit expenses and (ii) the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel for the
Agent with respect thereto. The Company further agrees to pay on demand all
costs and expenses of the Agent and the Lenders, if any (including, without
limitation, reasonable counsel fees and expenses), in connection with the
enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of
this Agreement, the Notes and the other documents to be delivered hereunder,
including, without limitation, reasonable fees and expenses of counsel for the
Agent and each Lender in connection with the enforcement of rights under this
Section 9.04(a).

          (b) Each Borrower agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Agent and
each Lender and each of their Affiliates and their officers, directors,
employees, agents and advisors (each, an "Indemnified Party") from and against
any and all claims, damages, losses, liabilities and expenses (including,
without limitation, reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) that may be
incurred by or asserted or awarded against any Indemnified Party, in each case
arising out of or in connection with or by reason of, or in connection with the
preparation for a defense of, any investigation, litigation or proceeding
arising out of, related to or in connection with the Notes, this Agreement, any
of the transactions contemplated herein or the actual or proposed use of the
proceeds of the Advances whether or not such investigation, litigation or
proceeding is brought by the Company, its directors, shareholders or creditors
or an Indemnified Party or any other Person or any Indemnified Party is
otherwise a party thereto and whether or not the transactions contemplated
hereby are consummated, except to the extent any such claim, damage, loss,
liability or expense has resulted from such Indemnified Party's gross negligence
or willful misconduct.


                                       59




<PAGE>

The Company also agrees not to assert any claim against any Indemnified Party on
any theory of liability for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages
arising out of or otherwise relating to the Notes, this Agreement, any of the
transactions contemplated herein or the actual or proposed use of the proceeds
of the Advances.

          (c) If any payment of principal of, or Conversion of, any Eurocurrency
Rate Advance or LIBO Rate Advance is made by the Borrower to or for the account
of a Lender other than on the last day of the Interest Period for such Advance,
as a result of a payment or Conversion pursuant to Section 2.03(d), 2.05(b),
2.09(a) or (b), 2.11 or 2.16, acceleration of the maturity of the Notes pursuant
to Section 6.01 or for any other reason, the Borrower shall, upon demand by such
Lender (with a copy of such demand to the Agent), pay to the Agent for the
account of such Lender any amounts required to compensate such Lender for any
additional losses, costs or expenses that it may reasonably incur as a result of
such payment or Conversion, including, without limitation, any loss (including
loss of anticipated profits), cost or expense incurred by reason of the
liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by any Lender to
fund or maintain such Advance.

          (d) Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement of the
Borrower hereunder, the agreements and obligations of the Borrower contained in
Sections 2.10, 2.13 and 9.04 shall survive the payment in full of principal,
interest and all other amounts payable hereunder and under the Notes and the
termination in whole of any Commitment hereunder.

          SECTION 9.05. Right of Set-off. Upon (a) the occurrence and during the
continuance of any Event of Default and (b) the making of the request or the
granting of the consent specified by Section 6.01 to authorize the Agent to
declare the Notes due and payable pursuant to the provisions of Section 6.01,
each Lender and each of its Affiliates is hereby authorized at any time and from
time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any
and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at
any time held and other indebtedness at any time owing by such Lender or such
Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of any Borrower against any and
all of the obligations of such Borrower now or hereafter existing under this
Agreement and the Note of such Borrower held by such Lender, whether or not such
Lender shall have made any demand under this Agreement or such Note and although
such obligations may be unmatured. Each Lender agrees promptly to notify the
relevant Borrower after any such set-off and application, provided that the
failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and
application. The rights of each Lender and its Affiliates under this Section are
in addition to other rights and remedies (including, without limitation, other
rights of set-off) that such Lender and its Affiliates may have.

          SECTION 9.06. Binding Effect. This Agreement shall become effective
(other than Sections 2.01 and 2.03, which shall only become effective upon
satisfaction of the conditions precedent set forth in Section 3.01) when it
shall have been executed by the Company and the Agent and when the Agent shall
have been notified by each Initial Lender that such Initial Lender has executed
it and thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of each
Borrower, the Agent and each Lender and their respective successors and assigns,
except that no Borrower shall not have the right to assign its rights hereunder
or any interest herein without the prior written consent of the Lenders.

<PAGE>

          SECTION 9.07. Assignments and Participations. (a) Each Lender may at
any time, with notice to the Company prior to making any proposal to any
potential assignee and with the consent of the Company, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld (and shall at any time, if requested to do so by the
Company pursuant to Section 2.05(b), 2.10 or 2.13) assign to one or more Persons
all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including,
without limitation, all or a portion of its Commitment, the Revolving Credit
Advances owing to it and the Revolving Credit Note or Notes held by it);
provided, however, that (i) the Company's consent shall not be required (A) in
the case of an assignment to an Affiliate of such Lender, provided that notice
thereof shall have been given to the Company and the Agent, or (B) in the case
of an assignment of the type described in subsection (g) below; (ii) each such
assignment shall be of a constant, and not a varying, percentage of all rights
and obligations under this Agreement (other than any right to make Competitive
Bid Advances, Competitive Bid Advances owing to it and Competitive Bid Notes);
(iii) except in the case of an assignment to a Person that, immediately prior to
such assignment, was a Lender or an assignment of all of a Lender's rights and
obligations under this Agreement, the amount of the Commitment of the assigning
Lender being assigned pursuant to each such assignment (determined as of the
date of the Assignment and Acceptance with respect to such assignment) shall in
no event be less than $10,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in
excess thereof; (iv) each such assignment shall be to an Eligible Assignee, (v)
each such assignment made as a result of a demand by the Company pursuant to
this Section 9.07(a) shall be arranged by the Company after consultation with,
and subject to the approval of, the Agent, and shall be either an assignment of
all of the rights and obligations of the assigning Lender under this Agreement
or an assignment of a portion of such rights and obligations made concurrently
with another such assignment or other such assignments that together cover all
of the rights and obligations of the assigning Lender under this Agreement, (vi)
no Lender shall be obligated to make any such assignment as a result of a demand
by the Borrower pursuant to this Section 9.07(a) unless and until such Lender
shall have received one or more payments from either the Borrower or one or more
Eligible Assignees in an aggregate amount at least equal to the aggregate
outstanding principal amount of the Advances owing to such Lender, together with
accrued interest thereon to the date of payment of such principal amount and all
other amounts payable to such Lender under this Agreement and all of the
obligations of the Borrower to such Lender shall have been satisfied; and (vii)
the parties to each such assignment shall execute and deliver to the Agent, for
its acceptance and recording in the Register, an Assignment and Acceptance,
together with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500 and, if the assigning
Lender is not retaining a Commitment hereunder, any Revolving Credit Note
subject to such assignment. Upon such execution, delivery, acceptance and
recording, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and
Acceptance, (x) the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the
extent that rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned to it pursuant
to such Assignment and Acceptance, have the rights and obligations of a Lender
hereunder and (y) the Lender assignor thereunder shall, to the extent that
rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned by it pursuant to such
Assignment and Acceptance, relinquish its rights and be released from its
obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and
Acceptance covering all or the remaining portion of an assigning Lender's rights
and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party
hereto, provided, however, that such assigning Lender's rights under Sections
2.10, 2.13 and 9.04, and its obligations under Section 8.05, shall survive such
assignment as to matters occurring prior to the effective date of such
assignment).


                                       61




<PAGE>

          (b) By executing and delivering an Assignment and Acceptance, the
Lender assignor thereunder and the assignee thereunder confirm to and agree with
each other and the other parties hereto as follows: (i) other than as provided
in such Assignment and Acceptance, such assigning Lender makes no representation
or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to any statements,
warranties or representations made in or in connection with this Agreement or
any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto or the execution,
legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of this
Agreement or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto; (ii)
such assigning Lender makes no representation or warranty and assumes no
responsibility with respect to the financial condition of any Borrower or the
performance or observance by such Borrower of any of its obligations under this
Agreement or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto; (iii)
such assignee confirms that it has received a copy of this Agreement, together
with copies of the financial statements referred to in Section 4.01 and such
other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate to make its own
credit analysis and decision to enter into such Assignment and Acceptance; (iv)
such assignee will, independently and without reliance upon the Agent, such
assigning Lender or any other Lender and based on such documents and information
as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit
decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement; (v) such assignee
confirms that it is an Eligible Assignee; (vi) such assignee appoints and
authorizes the Agent to take such action as agent on its behalf and to exercise
such powers and discretion under this Agreement as are delegated to the Agent by
the terms hereof, together with such powers and discretion as are reasonably
incidental thereto; and (vii) such assignee agrees that it will perform in
accordance with their terms all of the obligations that by the terms of this
Agreement are required to be performed by it as a Lender.

          (c) Upon its receipt of an Assignment and Acceptance executed by an
assigning Lender and an assignee representing that it is an Eligible Assignee,
together with any Revolving Credit Note or Notes subject to such assignment, the
Agent shall, if such Assignment and Acceptance has been completed and is in
substantially the form of Exhibit C hereto, (i) accept such Assignment and
Acceptance, (ii) record the information contained therein in the Register and
(iii) give prompt notice thereof to the Company and to each other Borrower.

          (d) The Agent shall maintain at its address referred to in Section
9.02 a copy of each Assumption Agreement and each Assignment and Acceptance
delivered to and accepted by it and a register for the recordation of the names
and addresses of the Lenders and the Commitment of, and principal amount of the
Advances owing to, each Lender from time to time (the "Register"). The entries
in the Register shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent
manifest error, and the Company, each other Borrower, the Agent and the Lenders
may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register as a Lender
hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement. The Register shall be available
for inspection by the Company, any other Borrower or any Lender at any
reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

          (e) Each Lender may sell participations to one or more banks or other
entities (other than the Company or any of its Affiliates) in or to all or a
portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including, without
limitation, all or a portion of its Commitment, the Advances owing to it and any
Note or Notes held by it); provided, however,


                                       62




<PAGE>

that (i) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement (including, without
limitation, its Commitment to the Company and the other Borrowers hereunder)
shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the
other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations, (iii) such Lender
shall remain the holder of any such Note for all purposes of this Agreement,
(iv) the Company, any other Borrower, the Agent and the other Lenders shall
continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such
Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, (v) no participant under
any such participation shall have any right to approve any amendment or waiver
of any provision of this Agreement or any Note, or any consent to any departure
by any Borrower therefrom, except to the extent that such amendment, waiver or
consent would reduce the principal of, or interest on, the Notes or any fees or
other amounts payable hereunder, in each case to the extent subject to such
participation, or postpone any date fixed for any payment of principal of, or
interest on, the Notes or any fees or other amounts payable hereunder, in each
case to the extent subject to such participation and (vi) within 30 days of the
effective date of such participation, such Lender shall provide notice of such
participation to the Company.

          (f) Any Lender may, in connection with any assignment or participation
or proposed assignment or participation pursuant to this Section 9.07, disclose
to the assignee or participant or proposed assignee or participant, any
information relating to the Company or any Borrower furnished to such Lender by
or on behalf of such Borrower; provided that, prior to any such disclosure, the
assignee or participant or proposed assignee or participant shall agree to
preserve the confidentiality of any confidential information relating to such
Borrower received by it from such Lender.

          (g) Notwithstanding any other provision set forth in this Agreement,
any Lender may at any time assign or create a security interest in all or any
portion of its rights under this Agreement (including, without limitation, the
Advances owing to it and any Note or Notes held by it) in favor of any Federal
Reserve Bank in accordance with Regulation A of the Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System.

          SECTION 9.08. Designated Subsidiaries (a) Designation. The Company may
at any time, and from time to time, by delivery to the Agent of a Designation
Letter duly executed by the Company and the respective Subsidiary and
substantially in the form of Exhibit E hereto, designate such Subsidiary as a
"Designated Subsidiary" for purposes of this Agreement and such Subsidiary shall
thereupon become a "Designated Subsidiary" for purposes of this Agreement and,
as such, shall have all of the rights and obligations of a Borrower hereunder.
The Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of each such designation by the
Company and the identity of the respective Subsidiary.

          (b) Termination. Upon the payment and performance in full of all of
the indebtedness, liabilities and obligations under this Agreement and the Notes
of any Designated Subsidiary then, so long as at the time no Notice of Revolving
Credit Borrowing or Notice of Competitive Bid Borrowing in respect of such
Designated Subsidiary is outstanding, such Subsidiary's status as a "Designated
Subsidiary" shall terminate upon notice to such effect from the Agent to the
Lenders (which notice the Agent shall give promptly upon its receipt of a
request therefor from the Company). Thereafter, the Lenders shall be under no
further obligation to make any Advance hereunder to such Designated Subsidiary.


                                       63




<PAGE>

          SECTION 9.09. Confidentiality. Each of the Lenders and the Agent
hereby agrees that it will use reasonable efforts (e.g., procedures
substantially comparable to those applied by such Lender or the Agent in respect
of non-public information as to the business of such Lender or the Agent) to
keep confidential any financial reports and other information from time to time
supplied to it by the Company hereunder to the extent that such information is
not and does not become publicly available and which the Company indicates at
the time is to be treated confidentially, provided, however, that nothing herein
shall affect the disclosure of any such information (i) by the Agent to any
Lender, (ii) to the extent required by law (including statute, rule, regulation
or judicial process), (iii) to counsel for any Lender or the Agent or to their
respective independent public accountants, (iv) to bank examiners and auditors
and appropriate government examining authorities, (v) to the Agent or any other
Lender, (vi) in connection with any litigation to which any Lender or the Agent
is a party, (vii) to actual or prospective assignees and participants as
contemplated by Section 9.07(f) or (viii) to any Affiliate of the Agent or any
Lender or to such Affiliate's officers, directors, employees, agents and
advisors, provided that, prior to any such disclosure, such Affiliate or such
Affiliate's officers, directors, employees, agents or advisors, as the case may
be, shall agree to preserve the confidentiality of any confidential information
relating to the Company received by it; a determination by a Lender or the Agent
as to the application of the circumstances described in the foregoing clauses
(i)-(viii) being conclusive if made in good faith; and each of the Lenders and
the Agent agrees that it will follow procedures which are intended to put any
transferee of such confidential information on notice that such information is
confidential.

          SECTION 9.10. Mitigation of Yield Protection. Each Lender hereby
agrees that, commencing as promptly as practicable after it becomes aware of the
occurrence of any event giving rise to the operation of Section 2.10(a), 2.11 or
2.13 with respect to such Lender, such Lender will give notice thereof through
the Agent to the respective Borrower. A Borrower may at any time, by notice
through the Agent to any Lender, request that such Lender change its Applicable
Lending Office as to any Advance or Type of Advance or that it specify a new
Applicable Lending Office with respect to its Commitment and any Advance held by
it or that it rebook any such Advance with a view to avoiding or mitigating the
consequences of an occurrence such as described in the preceding sentence, and
such Lender will use reasonable efforts to comply with such request unless, in
the opinion of such Lender, such change or specification or rebooking is
inadvisable or might have an adverse effect, economic or otherwise, upon it,
including its reputation. In addition, each Lender agrees that, except for
changes or specifications or rebookings required by law or effected pursuant to
the preceding sentence, if the result of any change or change of specification
of Applicable Lending Office or rebooking would, but for this sentence, be to
impose additional costs or requirements upon the respective Borrower pursuant to
Section 2.10(a), Section 2.11 or Section 2.13 (which would not be imposed absent
such change or change of specification or rebooking) by reason of legal or
regulatory requirements in effect at the time thereof and of which such Lender
is aware at such time, then such costs or requirements shall not be imposed upon
such Borrower but shall be borne by such Lender. All expenses incurred by any
Bank in changing an Applicable Lending Office or specifying another Applicable
Lending Office of such Lender or rebooking any Advance in response to a request
from a Borrower shall be paid by such Borrower. Nothing in this Section 9.10
(including, without limitation, any failure by a Lender to give any notice
contemplated in the first sentence hereof) shall limit, reduce or postpone any
obligations of the respective Borrower under Section 2.10(a), Section 2.11 or
Section 2.13, including any obligations payable


                                       64




<PAGE>

in respect of any period prior to the date of any change or specification of a
new Applicable Lending Office or any rebooking of any Advance.

          SECTION 9.11. Governing Law. This Agreement and the Notes shall be
governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New
York.

          SECTION 9.12. Execution in Counterparts. This Agreement may be
executed in any number of counterparts and by different parties hereto in
separate counterparts, each of which when so executed shall be deemed to be an
original and all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same
agreement. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this
Agreement by telecopier shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed
counterpart of this Agreement.

          SECTION 9.13. Jurisdiction, Etc. (a) Each of the parties hereto hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the
nonexclusive jurisdiction of any New York State court or federal court of the
United States of America sitting in New York City, and any appellate court from
any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the Notes, or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment, and
each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that
all claims in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and
determined in any such New York State court or, to the extent permitted by law,
in such federal court. Each Designated Subsidiary hereby agrees that service of
process in any such action or proceeding brought in the any such New York State
court or in such federal court may be made upon CT Corporation System at its
offices at 1633 Broadway, New York, New York 10019 (the "Process Agent") and
each Designated Subsidiary hereby irrevocably appoints the Process Agent its
authorized agent to accept such service of process, and agrees that the failure
of the Process Agent to give any notice of any such service shall not impair or
affect the validity of such service or of any judgment rendered in any action or
proceeding based thereon. Each Borrower hereby further irrevocably consents to
the service of process in any action or proceeding in such courts by the mailing
thereof by any parties hereto by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid,
to such Borrower at its address specified pursuant to Section 9.02. Each of the
parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding
shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by law. Nothing in this Agreement shall
affect any right that any party may otherwise have to serve legal process in any
other manner permitted by law or to bring any action or proceeding relating to
this Agreement or the Notes in the courts of any jurisdiction. To the extent
that each Designated Subsidiary has or hereafter may acquire any immunity from
jurisdiction of any court or from any legal process (whether through service or
notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution, execution
or otherwise) with respect to itself or its property, each Designated Subsidiary
hereby irrevocably waives such immunity in respect of its obligations under this
Agreement.

          (b) Each of the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally waives,
to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection that
it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Notes in any New
York State or federal court. Each of the parties hereto


                                       65

hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the defense
of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any
such court.

          SECTION 9.14. Substitution of Currency. If a change in any Foreign
Currency occurs pursuant to any applicable law, rule or regulation of any
governmental, monetary or multi-national authority, this Agreement (including,
without limitation, the definitions of Eurocurrency Rate and LIBO Rate) will be
amended to the extent determined by the Agent (acting reasonably and in
consultation with the Company) to be necessary to reflect the change in currency
and to put the Lenders and the Borrowers in the same position, so far as
possible, that they would have been in if no change in such Foreign Currency had
occurred.

          SECTION 9.15. Final Agreement. This written agreement represents the
full and final agreement between the parties with respect to the matters
addressed herein and supercedes all prior communications, written or oral, with
respect thereto. There are no unwritten agreements between the parties.

          SECTION 9.16. Judgment. (a) If for the purposes of obtaining judgment
in any court it is necessary to convert a sum due hereunder or under the Notes
in any currency (the "Original Currency") into another currency (the "Other
Currency"), the parties hereto agree, to the fullest extent that they may
effectively do so, that the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in
accordance with normal banking procedures the Agent could purchase the Original
Currency with the Other Currency at 9:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the first
Business Day preceding that on which final judgment is given.

          (b) The obligation of each Borrower in respect of any sum due in the
Original Currency from it to any Lender or the Agent hereunder or under the
Revolving Credit Note or Revolving Credit Notes held by such Lender shall,
notwithstanding any judgment in any Other Currency, be discharged only to the
extent that on the Business Day following receipt by such Lender or the Agent
(as the case may be) of any sum adjudged to be so due in such Other Currency,
such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) may in accordance with normal
banking procedures purchase Dollars with such Other Currency; if the amount of
Dollars so purchased is less than the sum originally due to such Lender or the
Agent (as the case may be) in the Original Currency, such Borrower agrees, as a
separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify such
Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) against such loss, and if the amount of
Dollars so purchased exceeds the sum originally due to any Lender or the Agent
(as the case may be) in the Original Currency, such Lender or the Agent (as the
case may be) agrees to remit to such Borrower such excess.

          SECTION 9.17. Waiver of Jury Trial. Each Borrower, the Agent and each
Lender hereby irrevocably waive all right to trial by jury in any action,
proceeding or counterclaim (whether based on contract, tort or otherwise)
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Notes or the actions of the
Agent or any Lender in the negotiation, administration, performance or
enforcement thereof.

          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to
be executed by their respective officers thereunto duly authorized, as of the
date first above written.

                                SCHEDULE 3.01(b)

                              DISCLOSED LITIGATION

          While not giving an opinion as to whether any item is "reasonably
likely to have a Material Adverse Effect," we hereby disclose the litigation
matters as stated in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2002,
under the heading "Legal Proceedings," the relevant portions of which are
attached.

     SHAREOWNER LITIGATION - Honeywell and seven of its current and former
officers were named as defendants in several purported class action lawsuits
filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey (the
Securities Law Complaints). The Securities Law Complaints principally allege
that the defendants violated federal securities laws by purportedly making false
and misleading statements and by failing to disclose material information
concerning Honeywell's financial performance, thereby allegedly causing the
value of Honeywell's stock to be artificially inflated. The purported class
period for which damages are sought is December 20, 1999 to June 19, 2000. On
January 15, 2002, the District Court dismissed the consolidated complaint
against four of Honeywell's current and former officers.

     We believe that there is no factual or legal basis for the allegations in
the Securities Law Complaints. Although it is not possible at this time to
predict the result of these cases, we expect to prevail. However, an adverse
outcome could be material to our consolidated financial position or results of
operations. As a result of the uncertainty regarding the outcome of this matter,
no provision has been made in our financial statements with respect to this
contingent liability.

     ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS - We are subject to various federal, state and local
government requirements relating to the protection of employee health and safety
and the environment. We believe that, as a general matter, our policies,
practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of
environmental damage and personal injury to our employees and employees of our
customers and that our handling, manufacture, use and disposal of hazardous or
toxic substances are in accord with environmental laws and regulations. However,
mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies, we,
like other companies engaged in similar businesses, have incurred remedial
response and voluntary cleanup costs for site contamination and are a party to
lawsuits and claims associated with environmental matters, including past
production of products containing toxic substances. Additional lawsuits, claims
and costs involving environmental matters are likely to continue to arise in the
future.

     With respect to environmental matters involving site contamination, we
continually conduct studies, individually at our owned sites, and jointly as a
member of industry groups at non-owned sites, to determine the feasibility of
various remedial techniques to address environmental matters. It is our policy
to record appropriate liabilities for environmental matters when environmental
assessments are made or remedial efforts or damage claim payments are probable
and the costs can be reasonably estimated. With respect to site contamination,
the timing of these accruals is generally no later than the completion of
feasibility studies. We expect that we will be able to fund expenditures for
these matters from operating cash flow. The timing of cash expenditures depends
on a number of factors, including the timing of litigation and settlements of




<PAGE>

personal injury and property damage claims, regulatory approval of cleanup
projects, remedial techniques to be utilized and agreements with other parties.

     Although we do not currently possess sufficient information to reasonably
estimate the amounts of liabilities to be recorded upon future completion of
studies, litigation or settlements, and neither the timing nor the amount of the
ultimate costs associated with environmental matters can be determined, they
could be material to our consolidated results of operations. However,
considering our past experience and existing reserves, we do not expect that
these matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial
position.

     ASBESTOS MATTERS - Like more than a thousand other industrial companies,
Honeywell is a defendant in personal injury actions related to asbestos. Our
involvement is limited because we did not mine or produce asbestos, nor did we
make or sell insulation products or other construction materials that have been
identified as the primary cause of asbestos-related disease in the vast majority
of claimants. Rather, we made several products that contained small amounts of
asbestos.

     Honeywell's Bendix Friction Materials business manufactured automotive
brake pads that included asbestos in an encapsulated form. There is a limited
group of potential claimants consisting largely of professional brake mechanics.
From 1981 through September 30, 2002, we have resolved approximately 56,000
Bendix claims at an average cost per claim of approximately one thousand two
hundred dollars. Through the second quarter of 2002, Honeywell had no
out-of-pocket costs for these cases since its insurance deductible was satisfied
many years ago. There are currently approximately 50,000 claims pending and we
have no reason to believe that the historic rate of dismissal will change. We
have $2 billion of insurance remaining, which we expect to cover the vast
majority of claims. Although it is impossible to predict the outcome of pending
or future claims, in light of our potential exposure, our prior experience in
resolving these claims, and our insurance coverage, we do not believe that the
Bendix asbestos-related claims will have a material adverse effect on our
consolidated results of operations or financial position.

     Another source of claims is refractory products (high temperature bricks
and cement) sold largely to the steel industry in the East and Midwest by North
American Refractories Company (NARCO), a business we owned from 1979 to 1986.
Less than 2 percent of NARCO's products contained asbestos.

     When we sold the NARCO business in 1986, we agreed to indemnify NARCO with
respect to personal injury claims for products that had been discontinued prior
to the sale (as defined in the sale agreement). NARCO retained all liability for
all other claims. NARCO has resolved approximately 176,000 claims through
January 4, 2002 at an average cost per claim of two thousand two hundred
dollars. Of those claims, 43 percent were dismissed on the ground that there was
insufficient evidence that NARCO was responsible for the claimant's asbestos
exposure. There are approximately 116,000 claims currently pending against
NARCO, including approximately 7 percent in which Honeywell is also named as a
defendant. During the past 18 years, Honeywell and our insurers have contributed
to the cost of the NARCO defense. We have


                                       2




<PAGE>

approximately $2 billion of insurance remaining that can be specifically
allocated to NARCO-related liability.

     On January 4, 2002, NARCO filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the
U.S. Bankruptcy Code. As a result, all of the claims pending against NARCO are
automatically stayed pending the reorganization of NARCO. In addition, because
the claims pending against Honeywell necessarily will impact the liabilities of
NARCO, because the insurance policies held by Honeywell are essential to a
successful NARCO reorganization, and because Honeywell has offered to commit the
value of those policies to the reorganization, the bankruptcy court has
temporarily enjoined any claims against Honeywell, current or future, related to
NARCO. Although the stay has been extended eight times since January 4, 2002,
there is no assurance that such stay will remain in effect. In connection with
NARCO's bankruptcy filing, we paid NARCO's parent company $40 million and agreed
to provide NARCO with up to $20 million in financing. We also agreed to pay $20
million to NARCO's parent company upon the filing of a plan of reorganization
for NARCO acceptable to Honeywell, and to pay NARCO's parent company $40
million, and to forgive any outstanding NARCO indebtedness, upon the
confirmation and consummation of such a plan.

     We are involved in ongoing negotiations with counsel representing more than
75% of the NARCO-related asbestos claimants regarding settlement of all pending
and potential NARCO-related asbestos claims against Honeywell. We believe that,
as part of the NARCO plan of reorganization, a trust will be established for the
benefit of all asbestos claimants, current and future. If the trust is put in
place and approved by the court as fair and equitable, Honeywell as well as
NARCO will be entitled to a permanent channeling injunction barring all present
and future individual actions in state or federal courts and requiring all
asbestos-related claims based on exposure to NARCO products to be made against
the federally-supervised trust. As part of its ongoing settlement negotiations,
Honeywell is seeking to cap its annual contributions to the trust with respect
to future claims at a level that would not have a material impact on Honeywell's
operating cash flows. Although there is no assurance that ongoing settlement
negotiations will be successfully completed or that a plan of reorganization
will be proposed or confirmed, the cost of securing a settlement which would
resolve all future, as well as all pending, NARCO-related asbestos claims could
exceed the value of our existing insurance and reserves plus the existing NARCO
assets. While any such settlement could have a material adverse impact on our
consolidated operating results or operating cash flows in the periods recognized
or paid, we do not believe that it would have a material adverse impact on our
consolidated financial position.

Agreement, and its obligations under Section 8.05 of the Credit Agreement, shall
survive the assignment pursuant to this Assignment and Acceptance as to matters
occurring prior to the Effective Date.

Effective Date, the Agent shall make all payments under the Credit Agreement and
the Revolving Credit Notes in respect of the interest assigned hereby
(including, without limitation, all payments of principal, interest and facility
fees with respect thereto) to the Assignee. The Assignor and Assignee shall make

                    ASSISTANT GENERAL COUNSEL FOR THE COMPANY

                                                             __________ __, 2002

To each of the Lenders parties
 to the Credit Agreement
 (as defined below),
 and to Citibank, N.A.,
 as Agent for said Lenders

                          Honeywell International Inc.

Ladies and Gentlemen:

          This opinion is furnished to you pursuant to Section 3.01(e)(iv) of
the 364-Day Credit Agreement dated as of November 27, 2002 among Honeywell
International Inc. (the "Company"), the Lenders parties thereto, and Citibank,
N.A., as Agent for said Lenders (the "Credit Agreement"). Terms defined in the
Credit Agreement are, unless otherwise defined herein, used herein as therein
defined.

          I have acted as counsel for the Company in connection with the
preparation, execution and delivery of the Credit Agreement.

          In that connection I have examined:

          (1) The Credit Agreement.

          (2) The documents furnished by the Company pursuant to Article III of
     the Credit Agreement, including the Certificate of Incorporation of the
     Company and all amendments thereto (the "Charter") and the By-laws of the
     Company and all amendments thereto (the "By-laws").

          (3) A certificate of the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware,
     dated ____________, 2002, attesting to the continued corporate existence
     and good standing of the Company in that State.

I have also examined the originals, or copies certified to my satisfaction, of
such corporate records of the Company (including resolutions adopted by the
Board of Directors of the Company), certificates of public officials and of
officers of the Company, and agreements, instruments and documents, as I have
deemed necessary as a basis for the opinions hereinafter expressed. As to
questions of fact material to such opinions, I have, when relevant facts were
not




<PAGE>

independently established by me, relied upon certificates of the Company or
its officers or of public officials. I have assumed the due execution and
delivery, pursuant to due authorization, of the Credit Agreement by the Initial
Lenders and the Agent.

          I am qualified to practice law in the State of New York, and I do not
purport to be expert in, or to express any opinion herein concerning, any laws
other than the laws of the State of New York, the General Corporation Law of the
State of Delaware and the Federal laws of the United States.

          Based upon the foregoing and upon such investigation as I have deemed
necessary, I am of the following opinion:

          1. The Company (a) is a corporation duly organized, validly existing
     and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, (b) is duly
     qualified as a foreign corporation in each other jurisdiction in which it
     owns or leases property or in which the conduct of its business requires it
     to so qualify or be licensed and (c) has all requisite corporate power and
     authority to own or lease and operate its properties and to carry on its
     business as now conducted and as proposed to be conducted.

          2. The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the
     Credit Agreement and the Notes of the Company, and the consummation of the
     transactions contemplated thereby, are within the Company's corporate
     powers, have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action, and do
     not (i) contravene the Charter or the By-laws or (ii) violate any law
     (including, without limitation, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the
     Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Chapter of the Organized
     Crime Control Act of 1970), rule, regulation (including, without
     limitation, Regulation X of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
     System) or any material order, writ, judgment, decree, determination or
     award or (iii) conflict with or result in the breach of, or constitute a
     default under, any material indenture, loan or credit agreement, lease,
     mortgage, security agreement, bond, note or any similar document. The
     Credit Agreement and the Notes of the Company have been duly executed and
     delivered on behalf of the Company.

          3. No authorization, approval, or other action by, and no notice to or
     filing with, any governmental authority, administrative agency or
     regulatory body, or any third party is required for the due execution,
     delivery and performance by the Company of the Credit Agreement or the
     Notes of the Company, or for the consummation of the transactions
     contemplated thereby.

          4. The Credit Agreement is, and each Note of the Company when
     delivered under the Credit Agreement will be, the legal, valid and binding
     obligation of the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance
     with their respective terms, except as the enforceability thereof may be
     limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or moratorium or other
     similar laws relating to the enforcement of creditors' rights generally or
     by the application of general principles of equity (regardless of whether
     such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law), and


                                       2




<PAGE>

     except that I express no opinion as to (i) the subject matter jurisdiction
     of the District Courts of the United States of America to adjudicate any
     controversy relating to the Credit Agreement or the Notes of the Company or
     (ii) the effect of the law of any jurisdiction (other than the State of New
     York) wherein any Lender or Applicable Lending Office may be located or
     wherein enforcement of the Credit Agreement or the Notes of the Company may
     be sought which limits rates of interest which may be charged or collected
     by such Lender.

          5. There is no action, suit, investigation, litigation or proceeding
     against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries before any court,
     governmental agency or arbitrator now pending or, to the best of my
     knowledge, Threatened that is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse
     Effect (other than the Disclosed Litigation) or that purports to affect the
     legality, validity or enforceability of the Credit Agreement or any Note of
     the Company or the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby,
     and there has been no adverse change in the status, or financial effect on
     the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, of the Disclosed Litigation from
     that described on Schedule 3.01(b) of the Credit Agreement.

          6. The Company is not an "investment company" within the meaning of
     the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

          7. The Company is not a "holding company" within the meaning of the
     Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended.

          In connection with the opinions expressed by me above in paragraph 4,
I wish to point out that (i) provisions of the Credit Agreement that permit the
Agent or any Lender to take action or make determinations may be subject to a
requirement that such action be taken or such determinations be made on a
reasonable basis and in good faith, (ii) that a party to whom an advance is owed
may, under certain circumstances, be called upon to prove the outstanding amount
of the Advances evidenced thereby and (iii) the rights of the Agent and the
Lenders provided for in Section 9.04(b) of the Credit Agreement may be limited
in certain circumstances.

                                                    Very truly yours,

To each of the Lenders parties
 to the Credit Agreement
 (as defined below),
 and to Citibank, N.A., as Agent
 for said Lenders

Ladies and Gentlemen:

          In my capacity as counsel to _____________________ ("Designated
Subsidiary"), I have reviewed that certain 364-Day Credit Agreement dated as of
November 27, 2002 among Honeywell International Inc., the Lenders named therein,
and Citibank, N.A., as Agent for such Lenders (the "Credit Agreement"). In
connection therewith, I have also examined the following documents:

          (i) The Designation Letter (as defined in the Credit Agreement)
     executed by the Designated Subsidiary.

          [such other documents as counsel may wish to refer to]

          I have also reviewed such matters of law and examined the original,
certified, conformed or photographic copies of such other documents, records,
agreements and certificates as I have considered relevant hereto.

          Except as expressly specified herein all terms used herein and defined
in the Credit Agreement shall have the respective meanings ascribed to them in
the Credit Agreement.

          Based upon the foregoing, I am of the opinion that:

     and to carry on its business as now conducted and as proposed to be
     conducted.

          2. The execution, delivery and performance by the Designated
     Subsidiary of its Designation Letter, the Credit Agreement and its Notes,
     and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, are within

     all necessary corporate action, and do not and will

     not cause or constitute a violation of any provision of law or regulation
     or any material order, writ, judgment, decree, determination or award or
     any provision of the charter or by-laws or other constituent documents of
     the Designated Subsidiary or result in the breach of, or constitute a
     default or require any consent under, or result in the creation of any
     lien, charge or encumbrance upon any of the properties, revenues, or assets
     of the Designated Subsidiary pursuant to, any material indenture or other
     agreement or instrument to which the Designated Subsidiary is a party or by
     which the Designated Subsidiary or its property may be bound or affected.
     The Designation Letter and each Note of the Designated Subsidiary has been
     duly executed and delivered on behalf of the Designated Subsidiary.

          3. The Credit Agreement and the Designation Letter of the Designated
     Subsidiary are, and each Note of the Designated Subsidiary when delivered
     under the Credit Agreement will be, the legal, valid and binding obligation
     of the Designated Subsidiary enforceable in accordance with their
     respective terms, except as the enforceability thereof may be limited by
     bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or moratorium or other similar laws
     relating to the enforcement of creditors' rights generally or by the
     application of general principles of equity (regardless of whether such
     enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law), and
     except that I express no opinion as to (i) the subject matter jurisdiction
     of the District Courts of the United States of America to adjudicate any
     controversy relating to the Credit Agreement, the Designation Letter of the
     Designated Subsidiary or the Notes of the Designated Subsidiary or (ii) the
     effect of the law of any jurisdiction (other than the State of New York)

     enforcement of the Credit Agreement, the Designation Letter of the
     Designated Subsidiary or the Notes of the Designated Subsidiary may be
     sought which limits rates of interest which may be charged or collected by
     such Lender.

          4. There is no action, suit, investigation, litigation or proceeding
     at law or in equity before any court, governmental agency or arbitration
     now pending or, to the best of my knowledge and belief, Threatened against
     the Designated Subsidiary that is reasonably likely to have a Material
     Adverse Effect or that purports to affect the legality, validity or

     Credit Agreement or any Note of the Designated Subsidiary or the
     consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby.

To the Initial Lenders party to the
 Credit Agreement referred
 to below and to Citibank, N.A.,
 as Agent

Ladies and Gentlemen:

          We have acted as special New York counsel to Citibank, N.A., as Agent,
in connection with the preparation, execution and delivery of the 364-Day Credit
Agreement dated as of November 27, 2002 (the "Credit Agreement"), among
Honeywell International Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and each
of you (each a "Lender"). Unless otherwise defined herein, terms defined in the
Credit Agreement are used herein as therein defined.

          In that connection, we have examined a counterpart of the Credit
Agreement executed by the Company, the Revolving Credit Notes executed by the
Company and delivered on the date hereof (for purposes of this opinion letter,
the "Notes") and, to the extent relevant to our opinion expressed below, the
other documents delivered by the Company pursuant to Section 3.01 of the Credit
Agreement.

          In our examination of the Credit Agreement, the Notes and such other
documents, we have assumed, without independent investigation (a) the due
execution and delivery of the Credit Agreement by all parties thereto and of the
Notes by the Company, (b) the genuineness of all signatures, (c) the
authenticity of the originals of the documents submitted to us and (d) the
conformity to originals of any documents submitted to us as copies.

          In addition, we have assumed, without independent investigation, that
(i) the Company is duly organized and validly existing under the laws of the
jurisdiction of its organization and has full power and authority (corporate and
otherwise) to execute, deliver and perform the Credit Agreement and the Notes
and (ii) the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Credit
Agreement and the Notes have been duly authorized by all necessary action
(corporate or otherwise) and do not (A) contravene the certificate of
incorporation, bylaws or other constituent documents of the Company, (B)
conflict with or result in the breach of any document or instrument binding on
the Company or (C) violate or require any governmental or regulatory
authorization or other action under any law, rule or regulation applicable to
the Company other than New York law or United States federal law applicable to
borrowers generally or, assuming the correctness of the Company's statements
made as representations and




<PAGE>

warranties in Section 4.01(c) of the Credit Agreement, applicable to the
Company. We have also assumed that the Credit Agreement is the legal, valid and
binding obligation of each Lender, enforceable against such Lender in accordance
with its terms.

          Based upon the foregoing examination and assumptions and upon such
other investigation as we have deemed necessary and subject to the
qualifications set forth below, we are of the opinion that the Credit Agreement
and each of the Notes are the legal, valid and binding obligations of the
Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their respective
terms.

          Our opinion above is subject to the following qualifications:

               (i) Our opinion above is subject to the effect of any applicable
          bankruptcy, insolvency (including, without limitation, all laws
          relating to fraudulent transfers), reorganization, moratorium or
          similar law affecting creditors' rights generally.

               (ii) Our opinion above is also subject to the effect of general
          principles of equity, including (without limitation) concepts of
          materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing (regardless
          of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

               (iii) We express no opinion as to the enforceability of the
          indemnification provisions set forth in Section 9.04 of the Credit
          Agreement to the extent enforcement thereof is contrary to public
          policy regarding the exculpation of criminal violations, intentional
          harm and acts of gross negligence or recklessness.

               (iv) We also express no opinion as to the enforceability of the
          provisions of Section 9.16 of the Credit Agreement (concerning
          currency conversion for judgments, and judgments in a currency other
          than that of the primary currency).

               (v) Our opinion above is limited to the law of the State of New
          York and the federal law of the United States of America and we do not
          express any opinion herein concerning any other law. Without limiting
          the generality of the foregoing, we express no opinion as to the
          effect of the law of a jurisdiction other than the State of New York
          wherein any Lender may be located or wherein enforcement of the Credit
