SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Validity.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision or provisions of this Agreement shall not

SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Counterparts.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to
be an original but all of which together will constitute one and the same instrument. </FONT></P>

SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Injunctive Relief.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Executive acknowledges that he has carefully read and considered all the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, including the restraints imposed upon him pursuant to Section&nbsp;11 hereof. The Executive agrees that said restraints are necessary for the reasonable and proper
protection
of the Company and that each and every one of the restraints is reasonable in respect to subject matter, length of time and geographic area. The Executive further acknowledges that, were he to breach
any of the covenants contained in Section&nbsp;11 hereof, the damage to the Company would be irreparable. The Executive therefore agrees that the Company, in addition to any other remedies available
to it, and notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, shall be entitled to seek preliminary and permanent injunctive relief against any breach or threatened breach by the
Executive of any of said covenants, without having to post bond. The parties further agree that, in the event that any provisions of Section&nbsp;11 hereof shall be determined by any court of
competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable by reason of its being extended over too great a time, too large a geographic area or too great a range of activities, such provision shall be deemed to be
modified to permit its enforcement to the maximum extent permitted by law. </FONT></P>

SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolution of Disputes.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any disputes arising under or in connection with this Agreement shall be resolved by
binding arbitration, to be held in Arlington, Virginia in accordance with the rules and procedures of the American Arbitration Association. Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be
entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. All costs and expenses of any arbitration or court proceeding (including fees and disbursements of counsel) shall be borne by the respective party
incurring such costs and expenses; </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>provided,</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> that the Company shall reimburse the Executive for such reasonable costs and expenses in the event he
substantially prevails in such arbitration or court proceeding; and further provided, that if the events to which such dispute relates occurred on or after a Change in Control, the Executive shall be
reimbursed by the Company for all such reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the Executive in seeking good faith to enforce his rights hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall
be entitled to seek equitable relief pursuant to Section&nbsp;17 hereof without otherwise waiving the right to exclusive arbitration of all other disputes. </FONT></P>

SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Release.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company shall not be required to make any payment pursuant to Section&nbsp;8 hereof in
connection with the termination of Executive's employment (other than by reason of death) unless and until the Executive executes a standard form of release provided by the Company. </FONT></P>

SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Entire Agreement.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Agreement sets forth the entire agreement of the parties hereto in respect of the
subject matter contained herein and supersedes all prior agreements, promises, covenants, arrangements, communications, representations or warranties, whether oral or written, by any officer, employee
or representative of any party hereto; and any prior agreement of the parties hereto in respect of the subject matter contained herein is hereby terminated and canceled. In the event of any
inconsistency between any provision of this Agreement and any provision applicable to the Executive in any plan, program, policy or other agreement of the Company, the provisions of this Agreement
shall control to the extent that such provisions of this Agreement are more favorable to the Executive. </FONT></P>
