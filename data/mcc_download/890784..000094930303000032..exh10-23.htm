               10.11 <I>No  General  Solicitation</I>.  T3 Group  did not  learn of the
          investment  in the Buyer Shares as a result of any public  advertising
          or general solicitation.


     11. <B><U>Representations of Buyer</U></B>. Buyer represents and warrants to Seller that:

          11.1  <I>Organization and Corporate Power</I>.  Buyer is a corporation,  duly
     organized,  validly  existing  and in good  standing  under the laws of the
     State of Colorado, and has all requisite corporate power,  franchises,  and
     licenses to own the assets and its  property  and  conduct the  business in
     which it is engaged.

          11.2 <I>Authority</I>.  This Agreement has been duly and validly  executed by
     Buyer and represents the valid and binding  obligation of Buyer enforceable
     in accordance with its terms.

          11.3 <I>No  Violations</I>.  Neither the execution of this  Agreement nor the
     consummation  of  the  transactions   contemplated  by  this  Agreement  is
     prohibited  by, nor will it result in, a breach of any term or provision of
     Buyer's certificate of incorporation or by-laws.

          11.4 <I>Capitalization</I>. The authorized capital stock of Buyer on the date
     hereof is  125,000,000  shares of common stock,  par value $.001 per share,
     and 2,500,000  shares of preferred  stock, par value $.001 per share. As of
     December 31, 2002, Buyer had outstanding 77,160,815 shares of common stock,
     1 share of 1996  Preferred  Stock and 75 shares of 1999  Series C Preferred
     Stock. As of that date,  approximately 33,153,728 shares were issuable upon
     the exercise of  outstanding  options,  warrants or other  rights,  and the
     conversion of preferred stock and debt.  Substantially  all of these shares
     and the shares  obligated to be issued in the future are freely  trading or
     subject to registration rights agreements.

          11.5  <I>Valid  Issuance</I>.  The Buyer  Shares  have been duly and  validly
     authorized and, when issued and paid for pursuant to this  Agreement,  will
     be  validly  issued,  fully paid and  nonassessable,  and shall be free and
     clear of all  encumbrances  and  restrictions,  except for  restrictions on
     transfer set forth in this Agreement and the Registration  Rights Agreement
     or imposed by applicable securities laws.

          11.6 <I>SEC Filings</I>. At the time of filing thereof,  the Annual Report on
     Form  10-K/A for the fiscal year ended  December  31,  2001,  and all other
     reports filed by Buyer pursuant to the Securities  Exchange Act of 1934, as
     amended (the "<U>Exchange Act</U>"), since the filing of the Annual Report on Form
     10-K/A and prior to the date  hereof  (the "<U>SEC  Filings</U>"),  complied as to
     form in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and
     did not contain any untrue  statement  of a material  fact or omit to state
     any material fact necessary in order to make the  statements  made therein,
     in the  light  of  the  circumstances  under  which  they  were  made,  not
     misleading.

          11.7 <I>Litigation</I>.  Except as set forth in the SEC Filings, there are no
     material   investigations,   claims,   disputes,   or  other   governmental
     proceedings  pending  against  Buyer or, to Buyer's  knowledge,  threatened
     against  Buyer nor to Buyer's  knowledge is Buyer  subject to any judgment,
     order or decree or other governmental  action or proceeding in which relief
     is sought  against  Buyer  which  would have an adverse  effect on Buyer or
     Buyer's  ability  to  consummate  the  transactions  contemplated  by  this
     Agreement.

          11.8 <I>Brokers and  Finders</I>.  No person or entity has, as a result of the
     transactions  contemplated by this Agreement,  any valid right, interest or
     claim  against  or upon Buyer or Seller  for any  commission,  fee or other
     compensation  pursuant  to  any  agreement,  arrangement  or  understanding
     entered into by or on behalf of Buyer.

     12.  <B><U>Taxes</U></B>.  To the extent there are any taxes due and owing by Seller with
respect to the Business  and/or the  Purchased  Assets after the date hereof but
relating to any period prior to the date hereof including,  without  limitation,
sales,  transfer and use and/or  similar  taxes or fees which may become due and
owing as a result of the  completion of the  transactions  contemplated  hereby,
Seller agrees to pay such taxes when due.

     13. <B><U>Indemnification; Survival</U></B>.

          13.1  <I>Seller  Indemnification</I>.  Seller  agrees to  indemnify  and hold
     Buyer,  and  each  of  Buyer's  owners,  officers,  directors,  agents  and
     affiliates,  harmless  from  and  against  any  claims,  losses,  expenses,
     obligations,  deficiencies,  liabilities  and lawsuits  (including  but not
     limited to  reasonable  attorney's  fees) which arise or result from or are
     related  to: (a) any  breach or  failure  of Seller to  perform  any of its
     covenants  or  agreements  set  forth  herein;  (b) the  inaccuracy  of any
     representation  or warranty made by Seller  herein;  (c) any  obligation or
     liability  of  Seller,  whether  arising  before or after the date  hereof,
     including  without  limitation taxes (including sales tax),  obligations to
     employees, and obligations and liabilities to suppliers or other creditors;
     and (d) any claims of Seller's  creditors  asserted against Buyer or any of
     Buyer's owners, officers,  directors,  agents or affiliates, or against the
     Purchased Assets by reason of noncompliance  with any applicable bulk sales
     laws (the "<U>Seller Indemnifiable Damages</U>").  Without limiting the generality
     of the foregoing with respect to the  measurement  of Seller  Indemnifiable
     Damages, Buyer shall have the right to be put in the same pre-tax financial
     position  as it  would  have  been  in had  each  of  the  representations,
     warranties, and covenants of Seller hereunder been true and correct and had
     the   agreements   and   covenants  of  Seller  been   performed  in  full.
     Notwithstanding the foregoing,  the aggregate amount payable by Seller with
     respect to Seller  Indemnifiable  Damages  shall in no event  exceed  Three
     Hundred Thousand Dollars ($300,000).  The  representations,  warranties and
     covenants of Seller in this  Agreement,  in any other document  executed in
     connection  herewith,  in any  certificate or Schedule  delivered  pursuant
     hereto or thereto and the liability of Seller for breaches thereof, and the
     indemnities referred to in this Section 10.1 shall survive the consummation
     of the  transactions  contemplated by this Agreement for a period of twelve
     (12) months following the date of the Closing provided,  however,  that the
     covenants, representations, and warranties described in Sections 6.4 (Clear
     Title) and 6.5  (Litigation)  shall survive the date of the Closing for the
     duration of the applicable statutes of limitations.

          13.2 <I>Buyer Indemnification</I>. Buyer agrees to indemnify and hold Seller,
     and each of Seller's owners,  officers,  directors,  agents and affiliates,
     harmless  from and  against  any  claims,  losses,  expenses,  obligations,
     deficiencies,  liabilities  and  lawsuits  (including  but not  limited  to
     reasonable  attorney's  fees)  which arise or result from or are related to
     (a) any  breach or  failure of Buyer to  perform  any of its  covenants  or
     agreements set forth herein;  and (b) the inaccuracy of any  representation
     or  warranty  made by Buyer  herein (the  "<U>Buyer  Indemnifiable  Damages</U>").
     Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  the aggregate amount payable by Buyer with
     respect  to Buyer  Indemnifiable  Damages  shall in no event  exceed  Three
     Hundred Thousand Dollars ($300,000).  The  representations,  warranties and
     covenants of Buyer in this  Agreement,  in any other  document  executed in
     connection  herewith,  in any  certificate or Schedule  delivered  pursuant
     hereto or thereto and the liability of Seller for breaches thereof, and the
     indemnities referred to in this Section 10.2 shall survive the consummation
     of the  transactions  contemplated by this Agreement for a period of twelve
     (12) months  following the date of the Closing,  provided  however that the
     covenants,   representations,  and  warranties  described  in  Section  8.7
     (Litigation)  shall survive the date of the Closing for the duration of the
     applicable statutes of limitations.

          13.3 <I>Miscellaneous</I>.  All statements contained in any Exhibit, schedule
     or other  instrument  delivered  or to be  delivered by or on behalf of the
     parties hereto, or in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby,
     shall be deemed  representations and warranties hereunder.  Notwithstanding
     any  knowledge  of  facts  determined  or  determinable  by  any  party  by
     investigation,  each  party  shall  have the  right  to  fully  rely on the
     representations,  warranties,  covenants and  agreements of the other party
     contained in this Agreement or in any other  documents or papers  delivered
     in  connection  herewith.  Each  representation,   warranty,  covenant  and
     agreement of the parties contained in this Agreement is independent of each
     other representation, warranty, covenant and agreement.

     14. <B><U>Bulk Sales</U></B>.  Seller shall  cooperate  with Buyer in complying  with all
provisions of the bulk sales statutes of all states having jurisdiction, in such
a way as to  provide  Buyer the  greatest  measure  of  protection  against  the
creditors of Seller allowable under all such statutes.

     15. <U><B>Notices</B></U>. Any notice or other communication  required by or permitted to
be given in  connection  with  this  Agreement  shall be in  writing,  except as
expressly   otherwise  permitted  herein,  and  shall  be  delivered  in  person
(including  via overnight  courier  service) or sent by telecopy or certified or
registered mail, return receipt  requested,  postage prepaid,  to the respective
parties at the addresses  referenced  below.  Each of the parties may change the
address to which it desires notices to be sent if it notifies the other party of
such  change in  accordance  with the  provisions  of this  Section 11. Any such
notice will be deemed to be given when received, if personally delivered or sent
by telecopy and, if mailed,  three (3) business days after deposit in the United
States mail, properly addressed, with proper postage affixed.

     16. <B><U>Entire Agreement</U></B>. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement among
the parties hereto  pertaining to the subject matter hereof and, except for Part
I,  Sections  2(b) and 2(c) and Part II,  Section  2(j) of the Letter of Intent,
supersedes   all   prior   and   contemporaneous   agreements,   understandings,
negotiations,  and  discussions,  whether oral or written,  of the  parties.  No
supplement,  modification,  amendment,  or  waiver  of this  Agreement  shall be
binding unless  executed in writing by the party to be bound thereby.  No waiver
of  any of the  provisions  of  this  Agreement  shall  be  deemed  to or  shall
constitute a waiver of any other provisions hereof (whether or not similar), nor
shall such waiver  constitute a continuing  waiver  unless  otherwise  expressly
provided.

     17.  <B><U>Governing Law</U></B>. This  Agreement  shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the internal laws of the State of New York,  without  reference
to the choice of law principles thereof.  Each of the parties hereto irrevocably
submits to the co-exclusive  jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York
and the United States District Courts for the Southern  District of New York for
the purpose of any suit,  action,  proceeding or judgment relating to or arising
out of this  Agreement and the  transactions  contemplated  hereby.  Each of the
parties hereto irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction of any such court in any
such suit,  action or proceeding and to the laying of venue in such court.  Each
party hereto irrevocably waives any objection to the laying of venue of any such
suit,  action or proceeding  brought in such courts and  irrevocably  waives any
claim that any such  suit,  action or  proceeding  brought in any such court has
been brought in an inconvenient  forum. In the event that litigation pursuant to
this  Agreement is commenced or in the event that any other  dispute  resolution
method is commenced,  the prevailing party's legal fees and court costs shall be
paid by the unsuccessful party.

     18. <B><U>Further  Assurances</U></B>.  At any time after the date hereof, at the request
of Buyer,  Seller will  execute,  acknowledge  and deliver all such  further and
other  assurances and documents and will take such other action  consistent with
the terms of this  Agreement  as may be  requested  by Buyer for the  purpose of
assigning,  transferring  and conveying to Buyer, or reducing to its possession,
any or all of the assets and rights being conveyed hereunder.

     19. <B><U>Expenses</U></B>.  Except as otherwise  provided herein,  the parties shall pay
their own fees and  expenses,  including  their own  counsel  fees,  incurred in
connection with this Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby.

     20.  <B><U>Amendment;  Waiver</U></B>.  This  Agreement  may  not be  modified,  amended,
supplemented,  canceled or discharged,  except by written instrument executed by
all parties.  No failure to  exercise,  and no delay in  exercising,  any right,
power or privilege under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver, nor shall any
single or partial exercise of any right,  power or privilege  hereunder preclude
the exercise of any other right, power or privilege.  No waiver of any breach of
any  provision  shall be deemed to be a waiver of any  preceding  or  succeeding
breach of the same or any other provision,  nor shall any waiver be implied from
any course of dealing between the parties.  No extension of time for performance
of any obligations or other acts hereunder or under any other agreement shall be
deemed to be an extension of the time for  performance of any other  obligations
or any other acts.  The rights and remedies of the parties under this  Agreement
are in addition to all other rights and  remedies,  at law or equity,  that they
may have  against  each other.  Consummation  of the  transactions  contemplated
hereby  shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any right or remedy  possessed  by
any party,  notwithstanding that such party should have known that such right or
remedy existed; provided,  however, that if any party had actual knowledge prior
to the Closing that such right or remedy  existed and chose not to exercise such
right or remedy prior to the Closing, such right or remedy shall be deemed to be
waived.

     21.  <B><U>Counterparts</U></B>.  This  Agreement  may  be  executed  in  any  number  of
counterparts, each of which shall be an original but all of which together shall
constitute one and the same instrument.  A telecopy signature of any party shall
be considered to have the same binding legal effect as an original signature.

     22.  <B><U>Severability</U></B>.  Any provision of this  Agreement  that is prohibited or
unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective
to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability  without  invalidating the
remaining provisions hereof but shall be interpreted as if it were written so as
to be  enforceable to the maximum  extent  permitted by applicable  law, and any
such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or
render  unenforceable  such provision in any other  jurisdiction.  To the extent
permitted by applicable law, the parties hereby waive any provision of law which
renders any provisions hereof prohibited or unenforceable in any respect.

     23.  <B><U>Headings</U></B>.  Section  headings  are  not to be  considered  part of this
Agreement, are included solely for convenience,  and are not intended to be full
or accurate descriptions of the contents hereof.

     24. <B><U>Parties Bound</U></B>. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and shall inure to
the benefit of, the parties  hereto,  their  respective  heirs,  administrators,
personal representatives, successors and assigns.
