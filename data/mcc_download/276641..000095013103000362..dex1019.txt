                              ---------------------

     A.   Certain of the Banks have issued commercial letters of credit for the
          account of the Company from time to time to finance purchases of
          inventory for itself and certain Material Subsidiaries. To facilitate
          such arrangement, the Company is the account party on all such letters
          of credit even though some commercial letters of credit have been or
          may be requested to be issued in the name of Material Subsidiary (as
          defined herein).

     B.   The Company has requested those Banks which are currently issuing such
          commercial letters of credit to consolidate a large portion of the
          various commercial letter of credit issuance arrangements into one
          agreement.

     C.   The Banks party thereto have agreed to terminate the Risk
          Participation Agreements, NT&SA has agreed to a cancellation of the
          Revolver Standby and the Banks have agreed to make available to the
          Company a revolving commercial letter of credit facility on the terms
          and conditions set forth herein. Commercial letters of credit issued
          by such Banks which are outstanding on the date hereof are defined as
          "Existing Letters of Credit" herein and will become part of this
          facility and be counted as utilization of this facility.

     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual agreements, provisions and

the Company; provided, however, that (A) no Issuing Bank shall be obligated to
             --------  -------
Issue Letters of Credit (x) in excess of its Issuance Allocation or, if an
Issuing Bank has received a Tenor Allocation, for a period of time longer than
its Tenor Allocation or (y) if the L/C Obligations owed to such Issuing Bank
would exceed its Issuance Allocation and (B) no Bank shall be obligated to
participate in any Letter of Credit if as of the date of Issuance of such Letter
of Credit (the "Issuance Date") the participation of such Bank in the Effective
                -------------
Amount of all L/C Obligations would exceed such Bank's Commitment. Within the
foregoing limits, and subject to the other terms and conditions hereof, the
Company's ability to obtain Letters of Credit shall be fully revolving, and,
accordingly, the Company may, during the foregoing period, obtain Letters of
Credit to replace Letters of Credit which have expired or which have been drawn
upon and reimbursed.

          An Issuing Bank may Issue Letters of Credit itself or may cause one of
its Affiliates to Issue Letters of Credit. Any such Affiliate Issuing Letters
of Credit shall have all of the rights of an Issuing Bank hereunder and may
exercise any of the remedies available to an Issuing Bank hereunder even though
such Affiliate is not a signatory to this Agreement or to the L/C-Related
Documents (other than Letters of Credit), and any Affiliate of an Issuing Bank
so Issuing Letters of Credit shall be an express third party beneficiary of this
Agreement and the L/C-Related Documents between the Issuing Bank with respect
to which it is an Affiliate and the Company. The Letter of Credit Offices of
each Issuing Bank and any Affiliate of such Issuing Bank through which such
Issuing Bank Issues Letters of Credit are set forth on Schedule 1.01, as such
                                                       -------------
schedule may change from time to time. Promptly after receipt by the Agent of
information from an Issuing Bank as to changes in its Letter of Credit Offices,
the Agent shall deliver an updated Schedule 1.01 to the Company and each Bank.
                                   -------------

          (b)   No Issuing Bank has an obligation to Issue any Letter of Credit
if:

               (i)  any order, judgment or decree of any Governmental Authority
     or arbitrator purports by its terms to enjoin or restrain such Issuing Bank
     from Issuing such Letter of Credit or any Requirement of Law applicable to
     the Issuing Bank or any request or directive (whether or not having the
     force of law) from any Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over the
     Issuing Bank prohibits, or requests that the Issuing Bank refrain from, the
     Issuance of commercial letters of credit generally or such Letter of

                                      -12-

<PAGE>

          Credit in particular or imposes upon such Issuing Bank with respect to
          such Letter of Credit any restriction, reserve or capital requirement
          (for which such Issuing Bank is not otherwise compensated hereunder)
          not in effect on the Closing Date, or imposes upon such Issuing Bank
          any unreimbursed loss, cost or expense which was not applicable on the
          Closing Date and which such Issuing Bank in good faith deems material
          to it;

               (ii)  such Issuing Bank has received written notice from any
          Bank, the Agent or the Company, on or prior to the Business Day
          prior to the requested date of Issuance of such Letter of Credit, that
          one or more of the applicable conditions contained in Article IV is
          not then satisfied;

               (iii) the expiry date of any requested Letter of Credit is more
          than 180 days after the date of Issuance; provided, however, that up
                                                    --------  -------
          to $20,000,000 of Letters of Credit may expire up to 364 days after
          the date of Issuance but in no event later than June 23, 1998; or

               (iv)  any requested Letter of Credit is not in form and substance
          acceptable to the relevant Issuing Bank, or the Issuance of a Letter
          of Credit violates any applicable policies of the Issuing Bank.

          (c)  If any Issuing Bank Issues a Letter of Credit which (i) causes
the aggregate amount of outstanding Letters of Credit Issued by such Bank to
exceed its Issuance Allocation, (ii) causes the outstanding L/C Obligations to
exceed the Commitments or (iii) does not comply with Section 2.0l(b)(iii) or
such Issuing Bank's Tenor Allocation, if any, such Issuing Bank shall be
solely responsible for collecting payment therefor from the Company, and the
Banks shall not be required to participate in the L/C Obligations relating
thereto. For purposes of determining the outstanding L/C Obligations and a
Bank's Issuance Allocation and Tenor Allocation on any date of determination,
each outstanding Letter of credit shall be deemed to be outstanding in the
undrawn face amount thereof for the thirty day period following its expiry date
unless previously cancelled, but in no event shall any Letter of Credit
constitute an L/C Obligation more than 30 days after its expiry date.

          (d)  Issuance of Letters of Credit by`an Issuing Bank under this
Agreement does not preclude an Issuing Bank from issuing Other Letters of
Credit; provided, however, that (i) Other Letters of Credit shall not be counted
        --------  -------
as utilization of an Issuing Bank's Issuance Allocation and (ii) the Banks shall
not be required to purchase risk participations pursuant to Section 2.03(b) in
such Other Letters of Credit.

     2.02 Issuance, Amendment and Renewal of Letters of Credit. (a) Each Letter
          ----------------------------------------------------
of Credit shall be issued, amended or renewed

                                      -13-

<PAGE>

upon the request of the Company (which request shall be irrevocable) received by
an Issuing Bank in accordance with arrangements between each Issuing Bank and
the Company to provide each Issuing Bank electronically with the information
necessary to issue, amend or renew Letters of Credit. The arrangements between
the Company and the various Issuing Banks are set forth in the L/C-Related
Documents (other than the Letters of Credit) between each Issuing Bank and the
Company. To the extent any term in any such L/C-Related Documents (other than a
Letter of Credit) conflicts with or is inconsistent with the terms of this
Agreement, the term most favorable to the Issuing Bank shall apply, and an
Issuing Bank may exercise its rights under either such L/C-Related Document or
this Agreement vis-a-vis the Company, but subject in any event to the
provisions herein with respect to sharing and notification. If any such
inconsistency exists, the Agent and the Banks shall not be deemed to have waived
any rights hereunder, nor shall any Issuing Bank be deemed to have waived any
rights under such L/C-Related Document, by reason of such inconsistency.

          (b)  No Issuing Bank shall be under an obligation to amend any Letter
of Credit if: (i) such Issuing Bank would have no obligation at such time to
issue such Letter of Credit in its amended form under the terms of this
Agreement or (ii) the beneficiary of any such Letter of Credit does not accept
the proposed amendment to the Letter of Credit. For purposes of determining the
tenor of a Letter of Credit which is to be amended or renewed, the periods of
180 days and 364 days referred to in Section 2.0l(b)(iii) shall be calculated
from the date of amendment or renewal of such Letter of Credit prior to or as of
the expiry date thereof.

          (c)  No Issuing Bank shall be under an obligation to renew any Letter
of Credit if such Issuing Bank would have no obligation at such time to issue
such Letter of Credit under the terms of this Agreement.

     2.03 Existing Letters of Credit; Risk Participations, Drawings and
          -------------------------------------------------------------
Reimbursements. (a) The Existing Letters of Credit shall be deemed for all
--------------
purposes, including for purposes of the fees to be collected pursuant to Section
2.08 and reimbursement of costs and expenses hereunder (but without duplication
of fees already paid under any other agreement with respect to any Existing
Letter of Credit), Letters of Credit outstanding under this Agreement and
entitled to the benefits of this Agreement and the L/C-Related Documents, and
shall be governed by the applications and agreements pertaining thereto and by
this Agreement. Each Bank shall be deemed to irrevocably and unconditionally
purchase from the Issuing Banks of Existing Letters of Credit on the Closing
Date a participation in each such Existing Letter of Credit and each drawing
thereunder in an amount equal to the product of (i) such Bank's Pro Rata Share
times (ii) the maximum amount available to be drawn under such

                                      -14-

<PAGE>

Letter of Credit and the amount of such drawing, respectively. The Existing
Letters of Credit shall be deemed to utilize pro rata the Commitment of each
Bank, and each Issuing Bank's Issuance Allocation shall be deemed utilized by
outstanding Existing Letters of Credit and unpaid drawings in respect thereof.

          (b)  Immediately upon the Issuance of each Letter of Credit in
addition to those described in subsection 2.03(a), each Bank shall be deemed to,
and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from each Issuing
Bank a participation in such Letter of Credit and each drawing thereunder in an
amount equal to the product of (i) the Pro Rata Share of such Bank, times (ii)
the maximum amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit and the
amount of such drawing, respectively. Each Issuance of a Letter of Credit shall
be deemed to utilize the Commitment of each Bank by an amount equal to the
amount of such participation.

          (c)  Each Issuing Bank will promptly notify the Company of any drawing
under a Letter of Credit. The Company shall reimburse the Issuing Bank on each
date that any amount is paid by the Issuing Bank under any Letter of Credit
(each such date, an "Honor Date") at such time(s) as are agreed upon by the
                     ----------
Company and the Issuing Bank's Letter of Credit Offices, in an amount equal to
the amount so paid by such Issuing Bank. If the Company fails to reimburse any
Issuing Bank for the full amount of any drawing under any Letter of Credit at
such agreed upon time on the.Honor Date, such Issuing Bank will promptly notify
the Agent and the Agent will promptly notify each Bank thereof, and the Company
shall be deemed to have incurred from the affected Issuing Bank an L/C Borrowing
in the amount of such drawing, which L/C Borrowing shall be due and payable on
demand (together with interest) and shall bear interest at a rate per annum
equal to the Base Rate plus 2% per annum.

          (d) Upon receipt of any notice from the Agent of any failure by the
Company to reimburse an Issuing Bank, each Bank shall make available to the
Agent for the account of the relevant Issuing Bank its Pro Rata Share of the
amount of such L/C Borrowing. If any Bank fails to transfer its Pro Rata Share
of the amount of-such L/C Borrowing to the Agent, interest shall accrue on such
Bank's obligation to make such payment from the Honor Date to the date such Bank
makes such payment, at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate in
effect from time to time during such period. Any failure of the Agent to give
notice to the Banks on an Honor Date or in sufficient time to enable any Bank to
effect such payment on such date shall not relieve such Bank from its
obligations under this subsection (d).

          (e) Each Bank's payment to the Issuing Bank pursuant to subsection
2.03(d) shall, be deemed payment in respect of its participation in such L/C
Borrowing and shall constitute an L/C

                                      -15-

<PAGE>

Advance from such Bank in satisfaction of its participation obligation.

          (f)  The Company hereby promises to pay all L/C Borrowings in
accordance with the terms set forth herein. The accounts or records maintained
by the Agent, each Issuing Bank and each Bank shall be conclusive absent
manifest error of the amount of Letters of Credit Issued for the account of the
Company, any L/C Borrowings and the interest and payments thereon. Any failure
to record or any error in recording such amounts shall. not limit or otherwise
affect the obligation of the Company hereunder to pay any amount owing in
respect thereof. To the extent that the records of the Agent conflict with the
records of any Bank or any Issuing Bank, the records of the Bank or the Issuing
Bank, as the case may be, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

          (g)  Each Bank's obligation to make L/C Advances as a result of a
drawing under a Letter of Credit, shall be absolute and unconditional and
without recourse to the Issuing Banks and shall not be affected by any
circumstance, including (i) any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or
other right which such Bank may have against the Issuing Banks, the Company or
any other Person for any reason whatsoever; (ii) the occurrence or continuance
of a Default, an Pvent of Default or a Material Adverse Effect; or (iii) any
other circumstance, happening or event whatsoever, whether or not similar to any
of the foregoing; provided, however, that after paying in full its reimbursement
                  --------  -------
obligation hereunder, nothing herein shall adversely affect the right of the
company or such Bank, as the case may be, to commence any proceeding against an
Issuer for any wrongful disbursement made by such. Issuer under a Letter of
Credit as a result of acts or omissions constituting gross negligence or willful
misconduct on the part of such Issuer.

          ---------------------------
(i) reimbursement from the company for any payment made by such Issuing Bank
under a Letter of Credit with respect to which any Bank has paid for its
participation in such Letter of Credit or (ii) payment of interest thereon, such
Issuing Bank will pay such amounts to the Agent, in the same funds as those
received by such Issuing Bank. The Agent shall promptly distribute to each Bank
its Pro Rata Share thereof.

          (b)  If the Agent or any Issuing Bank is required at any time to
return to the Company, or to a trustee, receiver, liquidator, custodian, or any
official in any Insolvency Froceeding, any portion of the payments made by the
Company to izhe Agent or to an Issuing Bank pursuant to subsection 2.04(a) in

time to time.

obligation of the Company in respect of the payment or set-off required to be
returned shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as if such
payment had not been made or such set-off had not been effected.

any beneficiary or transferee with respect to its use of any Letter of Credit;
provided, however, that this assumption is not intended to, and shall not,
--------  -------
preclude the Company's pursuing such rights and remedies as it may have
against the beneficiary or transferee at law or under any other agreement. No
Agent-Related Person, nor any of the respective correspondents, participants
or assignees of any Issuing Bank, shall be liable or responsible for any of the
matters described in clauses (i) through (vii) of Section 2.11; provided,

however, that the Company may have a claim against an Issuing Bank, and an
-------
Issuing Bank may be liable to the Company, to the extent of any direct, as
opposed to consequential or exemplary, damages suffered by the Company which the
Company proves were caused by such Issuing Bank's willful misconduct or gross
negligence or such Issuing Bank's willful failure to pay under any Letter of
Credit after the presentation to it by the beneficiary of a sight draft and
certificate(s) strictly complying with the terms and conditions of a Letter of

To each of the Banks parties to the Letter of Credit Facility Agreement
    hereinafter referred to and to Bank of America National Trust and Savings
    Association as Agent for the Banks

                              September ____, 1996

    Re:    Letter of Credit Facility Agreement, dated as of September 26, 1996

Ladies and Gentlemen:

    I am the General counsel of Spiegel, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the,
"Company"), and have acted as counsel to the Company in connection with the
 -------
negotiation, execution and de1ivery of the Letter of Credit Facility
Agreement, dated as of September 26, 1996 (the "Agreement"), among the Company,
                                                ---------
the various financial institutions which are or may become parties thereto
(collectively, the "Banks"), and Bank of America National Trust and Savings
                    -----
Association, the Agent.

    Unless otherwise defined herein, capitalized terms used herein shall have
the meanings assigned to such terms in the Agreement.

    I am familiar with the corporate proceedings taken by the Company in
connection with the foregoing agreements and documents and the transactions
contemplated thereby. In addition, I have examined such corporate records,
certificates and other documents and such questions of law as I have considered
necessary or appropriate for the basis of the opinions hereinafter expressed. As
to certain factual matters, I have relied, where I deemed appropriate, upon
information provided to me by other officers and employees of the Company.

    In making the examination of all documents and agreements in connection
with the opinions pressed herein, I have assumed the genuineness of all
signatures and authenticity of all documents submitted to me as originals and
the conformity with the originals of all documents submitted to me as copies.

    I have further assumed that the documents which are the subject of this
opinion letter constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the parties
thereto other than the Company, and that all such other parties have taken or
obtained

                                    EXHIBIT B

                                  Page 1 of 3

<PAGE>

all actions, consents and approvals required in connection with their execution,
delivery and performance of such documents.

     Based upon, and subject to, the foregoing, I am of the opinion that:

     1.   The Company is a corporation validly existing and in good standing
          under the laws of the State of Delaware. The Company is duly qualified
          and in good standing as a foreign corporation authorized to do
          business in each jurisdiction where its ownership or leasing of real
          estate, ownership of substantial assets other than real estate,
          conduct of substantial business, or location of employees require it
          to be so qualified and where the failure so to qualify would
          reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

     2.   Each Subsidiary is a corporation validly existing and in good standing
          under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation. Each
          Subsidiary is duly qualified in good standing as a foreign corporation
          authorized to do business in each jurisdiction where its ownership or
          leasing of real estate, ownership of substantial assets other than
          real estate, conduct of substantial business, or location of employees
          require it to be so qualified and where the failure so to qualify
          would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

     3.   The Company has full corporate power and authority to own and operate
          its properties and assets, carry on its business as currently
          conducted, and enter into and perform its obligations under the
          Agreement and each other L/C Related Document executed by it.

     4.   Each Subsidiary has full corporate power and authority to own and
          operate its properties and assets, carry on its business as currently
          conducted, and enter into and perform its obligations under the L/C
          Related Documents.

     5.   There is no provision in the articles or certificate of incorporation
          or the by-laws of the Company, nor any provision in any document
          evidencing any Contractual Obligation known to me after due inquiry
          to which the Company is a party or by which it or any of its
          properties may be bound, nor any writ, order or decision known to me
          after due inquiry of any court or governmental instrumentality binding
          on the Company which would be contravened by the execution and
          delivery by the Company of the Agreement or the other L/C Related
          Documents to which the Company is a party, nor do any of the foregoing
          prohibit performance by the Company of any term, provision, condition,
          covenant or

                                    EXHIBIT B

                                   Page 2 of 3

<PAGE>

          my other obligation of the Company contained therein. To the best of
          my knowledge after due inquiry, the execution and delivery by the
          Company of the Agreement and each such other L/C Related Document and
          the performance thereof and borrowing thereunder by the Company will
          not i) result in or require the creation or imposition of any Lien in
          any of its properties pursuant to the provisions of any document
          evidencing any Contractual Obligation binding on the Company, nor ii)
          violate any Requirement of Law.

     6.   Except as described in Schedule 5.05 of the Agreement, to the best of
          my knowledge after due inquiry, there are no actions, suits, claims,
          disputes or proceedings pending, or to the best of my knowledge,
          threatened against the Company or any Subsidiary before any court,
          arbitrator or Governmental Authority which i) purport to affect or
          pertain to the Agreement or any L/C Related Document or the
          transactions contemplated thereby, or ii) if determined adversely to
          the Company or its Subsidiaries would reasonably be expected to have a
          Material Adverse Effect.

     7.   Neither the making nor the performance of the Aqreement or any L/C
          Related Document by the Company requires any authorization, exemption,
          action, consent or approval of any Governmental Authority known to me
          after due inquiry.

     I am licensed to practice law only in the State of Illinois and,
accordingly, the foregoing opinions are limited solely to the laws of the State
of Illinois (other than the laws, regulations and ordinances of political
subdivisions thereof, as to which no opinion is given), the Delaware General
Corporation Law, and applicable federal laws of the United States.

     This opinion letter is being furnished to the Agent and the Banks and their
respective permitted assignees and participants for their use and the use of
their respective counsel, solely in connection with the transactions occurring
on the date hereof under the Agreement. No other use of this opinion may be made
without my prior written consent. I undertake no obligation to update any matter
herein.

                                                              Very truly yours,



                                                              Michael R. Moran
