                DEBTORS' JOINT PLAN OF REORGANIZATION PURSUANT TO
                 CHAPTER 11 OF THE UNITED STATES BANKRUPTCY CODE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

         Pursuant to Title 11 of the United States Code, 11 U.S.C. ss.ss. 101 et
seq., the Debtors and Debtors in Possession in the above-captioned and numbered
cases, hereby respectfully propose the following Joint Plan of Reorganization
under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code:

                                   Article I.

                     DEFINED TERMS, RULES OF INTERPRETATION,
                      COMPUTATION OF TIME AND GOVERNING LAW

A.       Rules of Interpretation, Computation of Time and Governing Law

         1. For purposes herein: (a) whenever from the context it is
appropriate, each term, whether stated in the singular or the plural, shall
include both the singular and the plural, and pronouns stated in the masculine,
feminine or neuter gender shall include the masculine, feminine and the neuter
gender; (b) any reference herein to a contract, instrument, release, indenture
or other agreement or document being in a particular form or on particular terms
and conditions means that such document shall be substantially in such form or
substantially on such terms and conditions; (c) any reference herein to an
existing document or exhibit Filed, or to be Filed, shall mean such document or
exhibit, as it may have been or may be amended, modified or supplemented; (d)
unless otherwise specified, all references herein to Sections, Articles and
Exhibits are references to Sections, Articles and Exhibits hereof or hereto; (e)
the words "herein," "hereof" and "hereto" refer to the Plan in its entirety
rather than to a particular portion of this Plan; (f) captions and headings to
Articles and Sections are inserted for convenience of reference only and are not
intended to be a part of or to affect the interpretation hereof; (g) the rules
of construction set forth in section 102 of the Bankruptcy Code shall apply; and
(h) any term used in capitalized form herein that is not otherwise defined but
that is used in the Bankruptcy Code or the Bankruptcy Rules shall have the
meaning assigned to such term in the Bankruptcy Code or the Bankruptcy Rules, as
the case may be.

         2. In computing any period of time prescribed or allowed hereby, the
provisions of Bankruptcy Rule 9006(a) shall apply.

         3. Except to the extent that the Bankruptcy Code or Bankruptcy Rules
are applicable, and subject to the provisions of any contract, instrument,
release, indenture or other agreement or document entered into in connection
herewith, the rights and obligations arising hereunder shall be governed by, and
construed and enforced in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York,
without giving effect to the principles of conflict of laws thereof.

B.       Reorganizing and Liquidating Debtors

         This Plan provides for two categories of Debtors: the Reorganizing
Debtors on the one hand, and the Liquidating Debtors on the other. The
classification and treatment of Claims and Equity Interests against the
Reorganizing Debtors is contained in Article III and the classification and
treatment of Claims and Equity Interests against the Liquidating Debtors is
reserved for in Article IV.

C.       Severability of Plan Provisions

         1. The Plan is comprised of a number of subplans of reorganization, one
for each Reorganizing Debtor and one for each of the Liquidating Debtors. The
confirmation requirements of section 1129 of the Bankruptcy Code must be
satisfied separately with respect to each subplan. If any subplan is not
confirmed, the Debtors reserve the right, with the prior written consent of the
Official Unsecured Committee, to either (a) request that the other subplans be
confirmed or (b) withdraw some or all subplans; provided that (i) the subplan
for CIHC may not be confirmed unless the subplan for CNC is confirmed and (ii)
the subplan for CNC may not be confirmed

<PAGE>

unless the subplan for CIHC is confirmed. Subject to the preceding provision,
the Debtors' inability to confirm or election to withdraw any subplan(s) shall
not impair the confirmation of any other subplan(s).

D.       Substantive Consolidation

         The estates of the Debtors have not been substantively consolidated.
The Claims held solely against one of the Debtors will be satisfied solely from
the cash and assets of such Debtor except as provided for herein. Except as
specifically set forth herein, nothing in this Plan or the Disclosure Statement
shall constitute or be deemed to constitute an admission that one of the Debtors
is subject to or liable for any Claim against any other Debtor. Except as
specifically set forth herein, the Claims of Creditors that hold Claims against
multiple Debtors will be treated as separate Claims with respect to each
Debtor's estate for all purposes (including, but not limited to, distributions
and voting), and such Claims will be administered as provided in the Plan. Any
Claims against any Debtor will be satisfied according to the terms of the Plan.

E.       Defined Terms

            practicable; provided that, Class 1A Claims representing obligations
            incurred in the ordinary course of business will be paid in full in
            Cash when such Class 1A Claims become due and owing in the ordinary
            course of business; or

                (ii) The Distribution Agent will treat such Claim in any other
            manner so that such Claim shall otherwise be rendered Unimpaired
            pursuant to section 1124 of the Bankruptcy Code;

            (c) Voting: Class 1A is Unimpaired and the Holders of Class 1A

            of the Bankruptcy Code; or

                (iii) such Claim will be otherwise treated in any other manner
            so that such Claim shall otherwise be rendered Unimpaired pursuant
            to section 1124 of the Bankruptcy Code;

            (c) Voting: Class 2A is Unimpaired and the Holders of Class 2A
         Claims are conclusively deemed to have accepted the Plan pursuant to
         section 1126(f) of the Bankruptcy Code. Therefore, the Holders of

         Senior Notes Claims in order to facilitate a consensual Plan. The
         Junior Recovery is being provided with the consent of the Holders of
         the Lender Claims and Senior Notes Claims. If Class 10A fails to accept
         the Plan, Holders of Class 10A, 11A and 12A Claims or Interests will
         not receive a distribution under the Plan, and the distributions that
         are reserved for Class 10A under this paragraph shall instead be
         included in the Senior Notes CNC Distribution. The Debtors reserve the
         right (i) to request that the Bankruptcy Court confirm the Plan in
         accordance with section 1129(b) of the Bankruptcy Code and/or (ii) to

director, officer or employee of any other corporation or legal entity, to the
extent provided in such Debtor's constitutive documents, by a written agreement

permitted thereunder), shall be deemed and treated as executory contracts that
are assumed by the relevant Reorganized Debtor (it being understood that
Reorganized CNC is the relevant Reorganized Debtor of CNC) pursuant hereto and
section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code as of the Effective Date. Accordingly, such
indemnification obligations shall survive Unimpaired and unaffected by entry of
the Confirmation Order, irrespective of whether such indemnification is owed for

E.       Compensation and Benefit Programs

         Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all employment and

assumed pursuant to the provisions of sections 365 and 1123 of the Bankruptcy
Code; and the Debtors' obligations under such programs to Persons shall survive
confirmation of this Plan, except for (i) executory contracts or employee
benefit plans specifically rejected pursuant to this Plan (to the extent such
rejection does not violate sections 1114 and 1129(a)(13) of the Bankruptcy
Code), (ii) all employee equity or equity-based incentive plans, and (iii) such

"retiree benefits" as defined in section 1114(a) of the Bankruptcy Code shall
continue.

F.       Assumption of D&O Insurance

the Debtors are hereby assumed. Entry of the order confirming the Plan by the
clerk of the Bankruptcy Court shall constitute approval of such assumptions
pursuant to section 365(a) of the Bankruptcy Code. The Reorganized Debtors shall
maintain for a period not less than 10 years from the Effective Date coverage
for the individuals covered, as of the Petition Date, by such policies at levels
and on terms no less favorable to such individuals than the terms and levels
provided for under the policies assumed pursuant to the Plan. Solely with
respect to directors and officers of any of the Debtors who served in such
capacity at any time on or after the Petition Date, the Debtors shall be deemed
to assume, as of the Effective Date, their respective obligations to indemnify
such individuals (and only such individuals) with respect to or based upon any
act or omission taken or omitted in any of such capacities, or for or on behalf
of any Debtor, pursuant to and to the extent provided by the Debtors' respective
articles of incorporation, certificates of formation, corporate charters,
bylaws, and similar corporate documents as in effect as of the date of entry of
the Confirmation Order. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, such assumed indemnity obligations shall not be discharged, Impaired, or
otherwise modified by confirmation of this Plan and shall be deemed and treated
as executory contracts that have been assumed by the Debtors pursuant to this
Plan as to which no proofs of claim need be Filed.

made at the address of the Holder of such Claim or Equity Interest as indicated
on the records of the Debtors as of the date that such distribution is made.

         2. Undeliverable Distributions

            (a) Holding of Undeliverable Distributions

         If any distribution to a Holder of an Allowed Claim or Allowed Equity
Interest is returned to the Distribution Agent as undeliverable, no further
distributions shall be made to such Holder unless and until the Distribution
Agent is notified in writing of such Holder's then-current address.
Undeliverable distributions shall remain in the possession of the Distribution
Agent subject to Subsection (b) below until such time as a distribution becomes
deliverable. Undeliverable Cash shall not be entitled to any interest, dividends
or other accruals of any kind. As soon as reasonably practicable, the
Distribution Agent shall make all distributions that become deliverable.

            (b) Failure to Claim Undeliverable Distributions

                                       34
<PAGE>

         In an effort to ensure that all Holders of Allowed Claims and Equity
Interests receive their allocated distributions, ninety (90) days after the
Effective Date, the Reorganized Debtors will file with the Bankruptcy Court a
listing of unclaimed distributions. This list will be maintained for as long as
the Chapter 11 Cases stay open. Any Holder of an Allowed Claim or Equity
Interest (irrespective of when a Claim or Equity Interest became an Allowed
Claim or Equity Interest) that does not assert a Claim or Equity Interest
pursuant hereto for an undeliverable distribution (regardless of when not
deliverable) within two years after the Effective Date shall have its Claim or
Equity Interest for such undeliverable distribution discharged and shall be
forever barred from asserting any such Claim or Equity Interest against the
relevant Reorganized Debtor or its property. In such cases: (i) any Cash held
for distribution on account of such Claims or Equity Interests shall be property
of the relevant Reorganized Debtor free of any restrictions thereon; and (ii)
any securities issued hereunder held for distribution on account of such Claims
or Equity Interests shall be canceled and of no further force or effect. Nothing
contained herein shall require any Reorganized Debtor or the Distribution Agent
to attempt to locate any Holder of an Allowed Claim or Allowed Equity Interest.

         3. Compliance with Tax Requirements/Allocations

         In connection with the Plan, to the extent applicable, each
Reorganizing Debtor, Reorganized Debtor and the Distribution Agent shall comply
with all tax withholding and reporting requirements imposed on it by any
governmental unit, and all distributions pursuant hereto shall be subject to
such withholding and reporting requirements. Each Reorganizing Debtor,
Reorganized Debtor and the Distribution Agent shall be authorized to take all
actions necessary or appropriate to comply with such withholding and reporting
requirements. For tax purposes, distributions received in respect of Allowed
Claims will be allocated first to the principal amount of Allowed Claims, with
any excess allocated to unpaid interest that accrued on such Claims.

D.       Timing and Calculation of Amounts to be Distributed

         On the Effective Date or as soon as practicable thereafter, each Holder
of an Allowed Claim against or Allowed Equity Interest in the Debtors shall
receive the full amount of the distributions that the Plan provides for Allowed
Claims or Allowed Equity Interests in the applicable Class. If and to the extent
that there are Disputed Claims or Disputed Equity Interests, distributions on
account of such Disputed Claims or Equity Interests shall be made pursuant to
the provisions set forth in Article X.A.4.

E.       Minimum Distribution

         Any other provision of the Plan notwithstanding, payments of fractions
of shares of New CNC Common Stock or New CNC Preferred Stock or fractions of New
CNC Warrants will not be made and will be deemed to be zero. Any other provision
of the Plan notwithstanding, the Reorganized Debtors or the Distribution Agent
will not be required to make distributions or payments of fractions of dollars.
Whenever any payment of a fraction of a dollar under the Plan would otherwise be
called for, the actual payment will reflect a rounding of such fraction to the
nearest whole dollar (up or down), with half dollars or less being rounded down.

F.       Setoffs

         Except as expressly provided for herein, each Reorganizing Debtor and
Reorganized Debtor may, as the case may be, pursuant to section 553 of the
Bankruptcy Code or applicable non-bankruptcy law, set off against any Allowed
Claim or Equity Interest and the distributions to be made pursuant hereto on
account of such Allowed Claim or Equity Interest (before any distribution is
made on account of such Claim or Equity Interest), any Claims, Equity Interests,
rights and Causes of Action of any nature that such Reorganizing Debtor or
Reorganized Debtor, as the case may be, may hold against the Holder of such
Allowed Claim or Equity Interest to the extent the Claims, Equity Interests,
rights or Causes of Action against such Holder have not been compromised or
settled on or prior to the Effective Date (whether pursuant to the Plan or
otherwise); provided that, neither the failure to effect such a setoff nor the
allowance of any Claim or Equity Interest hereunder shall constitute a waiver or
release by such Reorganizing Debtor or Reorganized Debtor of any such Claims,
Equity Interests, rights and Causes of Action that such Reorganizing Debtor or
Reorganized Debtor may possess against such Holder.

                                       35
<PAGE>

         Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, on the Effective
Date, prior to effectuating the distribution contemplated by this Plan, the
CIHC/CFC Intercompany Notes shall be offset against (i) the CFC/CIHC
Intercompany Notes, (ii) all other prepetition amounts owed by CFC and (iii) all
postpetition amounts owed by CFC that are not repaid in full in Cash by CFC,
including, without limitation, health and welfare benefits, insurance, other
direct CFC expenses and an appropriate allocation of the postpetition
professional fees paid by CIHC. Any balance of the CIHC/CFC Intercompany Notes
remaining after giving effect to all the setoffs in the preceding sentence will
be Class 6B Claims.

         In addition, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of
the Reorganizing Debtors shall offset against Claims by any of the Liquidating
Debtors all (x) prepetition Claims owing by the Liquidating Debtors to the
Reorganizing Debtors, including without limitation, (i) amounts owing under the
prepetition tax sharing payments, (ii) in connection with EXL Services.com,
(iii) an appropriate allocation of prepetition professional fees incurred by the
Debtors in connection with restructuring of the Debtors and the preparation for
these Chapter 11 Cases, (iv) prepetition amounts owing by the Liquidating
Debtors to Conseco Services LLC or CIHC, and (y) postpetition amounts owing by
the Liquidating Debtors to the Reorganizing Debtors that are not repaid in full
in Cash, including without limitation, (i) postpetition tax sharing payments
owed by the Liquidating Debtors, (ii) an appropriate allocation of the
postpetition professional fees incurred by the Reorganizing Debtors during these
Chapter 11 Cases and (iii) postpetition amounts owed by the Liquidating Debtors
to Conseco Services LLC or CIHC.

G.       Surrender of Canceled Instruments or Securities

or Equity Interest relating to the (i) Senior Credit Facility, (ii) CIHC
Guarantee of Senior Credit Facilities, (iii) CNC Guarantee of D&O Credit
Facilities, (iv) CIHC Guarantee of D&O Credit Facilities, (v) Exchanged Notes,
(vi) Original Notes, (vii) Subordinated Debentures, (viii) CNC Common Stock, or

underlying such Claim or Equity Interest, and all such surrendered certificates
and other documentations shall be marked as canceled.

Senior Credit Facility, (ii) CIHC Guarantee of Senior Credit Facility, (iii) CNC
Guarantee of D&O Credit Facilities, (iv) CIHC Guarantee of D&O Credit
Facilities, (v) Exchanged Notes, (vi) Original Notes, (vii) Subordinated

surrender or is deemed to have failed to surrender its certificates or other
documentation representing such Claim or Equity Interest required to be tendered
hereunder within one year after the Effective Date shall have its Claim for a
distribution pursuant hereto on account of such Allowed Claim or Allowed Equity
Interests discharged and shall be forever barred from asserting any such Claim
or Equity Interest against any Reorganizing Debtor, Reorganized Debtor, the
Distribution Agent or their assets.

I.       Lost, Stolen, Mutilated or Destroyed Debt Securities

         Any Holder of Allowed Claims or Equity Interests relating to the (i)
Senior Credit Facility, (ii) CIHC Guarantee of Senior Credit Facility, (iii) CNC
Guarantee of D&O Credit Facilities, (iv) CIHC Guarantee of D&O Credit
Facilities, (v) Exchanged Notes, (vi) Original Notes, (vii) Subordinated
Debentures, (viii) CNC Common Stock, or (ix) CNC Preferred Stock that is
evidenced by a note or by a stock certificate which has been lost, stolen,
mutilated or destroyed shall, in lieu of surrendering such note or stock
certificate, deliver to the Distribution Agent: (a) an affidavit of loss
reasonably satisfactory to the Distribution Agent setting forth the
unavailability of the note or the stock certificate; and (b) such additional
indemnity as may reasonably be required by the Distribution Agent to hold the
Distribution Agent harmless from any damages, liabilities or costs incurred in
treating such individual as a Holder of an Allowed Claim or Equity Interest.
Upon compliance with this procedure by a Holder of an Allowed Claim or Equity
Interest evidenced by such a lost, stolen, mutilated or destroyed note or stock
certificate, such Holder shall, for all purposes under the Plan, be deemed to
have surrendered such note or certificate.

                                  Article IX.

                PROCEDURES FOR RESOLUTION OF DISPUTED, CONTINGENT
                   AND UNLIQUIDATED CLAIMS OR EQUITY INTERESTS

A.       Resolution of Disputed Claims

         1. Prosecution of Objections to Claims

         After the Effective Date, the Reorganized Debtors (for Claims against
the Reorganized Debtors) shall have the exclusive authority on or before the
Claims Objection Bar Date to file objections, settle, compromise, withdraw or
litigate to judgment objections to Claims or Equity Interests. From and after
the Effective Date, the Debtors and Reorganized Debtors may settle or compromise
any Disputed Claim or Equity Interest without approval of the Bankruptcy Court.
The Debtors, Reorganizing Debtors and Reorganized Debtors also reserve the right
to resolve any Disputed Claims or Equity Interests outside the Bankruptcy Court
under applicable governing law.

         2. Estimation of Claims and Equity Interests

         The Reorganizing Debtors and the Reorganized Debtors may, at any time,
request that the Bankruptcy Court estimate any contingent or unliquidated Claim
or Equity Interest pursuant to section 502(c) of the Bankruptcy Code regardless
of whether such Reorganizing Debtor or Reorganized Debtor has previously
objected to such Claim or Equity Interest or whether the Bankruptcy Court has
ruled on any such objection, and the Bankruptcy Court will retain jurisdiction
to estimate any Claim or Equity Interest at any time during litigation
concerning any objection to any Claim or Equity Interest, including during the
pendency of any appeal relating to any such objection. In the event that the
Bankruptcy Court estimates any contingent or unliquidated Claim, that estimated
amount will constitute either the Allowed amount of such Claim or a maximum
limitation on such Claim, as determined by the Bankruptcy Court. If the
estimated amount constitutes a maximum limitation on such Claim, the relevant
Reorganizing Debtor or Reorganized Debtor may elect to pursue any supplemental
proceedings to object to any ultimate payment on such Claim. All of the
aforementioned Claims or Equity Interests and objection, estimation and
resolution procedures are cumulative and not necessarily exclusive of one
another. Claims and Equity Interests may be estimated and subsequently
compromised, settled, withdrawn or resolved by any mechanism approved by the
Bankruptcy Court.

         3. Payments and Distributions on Disputed Claims and Equity Interests

         Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, except as
otherwise agreed by a Reorganizing Debtor or Reorganized Debtor (for Claims
against the Reorganized Debtors) in its sole discretion, no partial payments and
no partial distributions will be made with respect to a Disputed Claim or Equity
Interest until the resolution of such disputes by settlement or Final Order. On
the date or, if such date is not a Business Day, on the next successive Business
Day that is 20 calendar days after the calendar quarter in which a Disputed
Claim or Equity Interest becomes an Allowed Claim or Allowed Equity Interest,
the Holder of such Allowed Claim or Allowed Equity Interest will receive all
payments and distributions to which such Holder is then entitled under the Plan.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Person or Entity who holds both an Allowed
Claim(s) and a Disputed Claim(s) (or an Allowed Equity Interest(s) and a
Disputed Equity Interest(s)) will not receive the appropriate payment or
distribution on the Allowed Claim(s) (or Allowed Equity Interest(s)) except, as
otherwise agreed by such Reorganizing Debtor or Reorganized Debtor, as the case
may be, in its sole discretion, until the Disputed Claim(s) or Disputed Equity
Interest(s) are resolved by settlement or Final Order. In the event that there
are Disputed Claims or Equity Interests requiring adjudication and resolution,
the Reorganizing Debtors and Reorganized Debtors reserve the right, or upon
order of the Court, to establish appropriate reserves for potential payment of
such Claims or Equity Interests.

                                       37
<PAGE>

B.       Allowance of Claims and Equity Interests

         Except as expressly provided herein or in any order entered in the
Chapter 11 Cases prior to the Effective Date (including the Confirmation Order),
no Claim or Equity Interest shall be deemed Allowed, unless and until such Claim
or Equity Interest is deemed Allowed under the Bankruptcy Code or the Bankruptcy
Court enters a Final Order in the Chapter 11 Cases allowing such Claim or Equity
Interest. Except as expressly provided in the Plan or any order entered in the
Chapter 11 Cases prior to the Effective Date (including the Confirmation Order),
the Reorganizing Debtors (for Claims against the Reorganizing Debtors) or
Reorganized Debtors after confirmation will have and retain any and all rights
and defenses such Debtor had with respect to any Claim or Equity Interest as of
Petition Date.

C.       Controversy Concerning Impairment

         If a controversy arises as to whether any Claims or Equity Interests,
or any Class of Claims or Equity Interests, are Impaired under the Plan, the
Bankruptcy Court shall, after notice and a hearing, determine such controversy
before the Confirmation Date.

D.       Reserve of New CNC Common Stock

         On the Effective Date, CNC shall maintain in reserve shares of New CNC
Common Stock as the New CNC Common Stock Holdback. The New CNC Common Stock
Holdback, along with any dividends or other distributions accruing with respect
thereto, shall be held for the Holders of Disputed Class 4A, 6A, 7A, 8A, 4B-1,
4B-2, 5B and 6B Claims and Equity Interests. As Disputed Class 4A, 6A, 7A, 8A,
4B-1, 4B-2,5B and 6B Claims and Equity Interests are resolved, (a) CNC shall
distribute, in accordance with the terms hereof, New CNC Common Stock to Holders
of Allowed Class 4A, 6A, 7A, 8A, 4B-1, 4B-2,5B and 6B Claims and Equity
Interests (along with dividends and distributions that accrue after the
Effective Date), and (b) the New CNC Common Stock Holdback shall be adjusted.

with the Plan or any other act taken or omitted to be taken in connection with

E.       Preservation of Rights of Action

         1. Maintenance of Causes of Action

         Except as otherwise provided in the Plan, the Reorganized Debtors shall
retain all rights to commence and pursue, as appropriate, any and all Causes of
Action, whether arising before or after the Petition Date, in any court or other
tribunal including, without limitation, in an adversary proceeding Filed in one
or more of the Chapter 11 Cases including the actions specified on Exhibit G to
the Disclosure Statement.

         Except as otherwise provided in the Plan, in accordance with section
1123(b)(3) of the Bankruptcy Code, any Claims, rights, and Causes of Action that
the respective Reorganizing Debtors may hold against any Entity shall vest in
the Reorganized Debtors, as the case may be. The applicable Reorganized Debtor,
through its authorized agents or representatives, shall retain and may
exclusively enforce any and all such Claims, rights or Causes of Action. The
Reorganized Debtors shall have the exclusive right, authority, and discretion to
institute, prosecute, abandon, settle, or compromise any and all such Claims,
rights, and Causes of Action without the consent or approval of any third party
and without any further order of court.

         2. Preservation of All Causes of Action Not Expressly Settled or
Released

         Unless a Claim or Cause of Action against a Creditor or other Person is
expressly waived, relinquished, released, compromised or settled in the Plan or
any Final Order, the Debtors expressly reserve such Claim or Cause of Action for
later adjudication by the Debtors, and, therefore, no preclusion doctrine,
including, without limitation, the doctrines of res judicata, collateral
estoppel, issue preclusion, Claim preclusion, waiver, estoppel (judicial,
equitable or otherwise) or laches shall apply to such Claims or Causes of Action
upon or after the confirmation or Consummation of the Plan based on the
Disclosure Statement, the Plan or the Confirmation Order, except where such
Claims or Causes of Action have been waived, relinquished, released, compromised
or settled in the Plan or a Final Order. In addition, the Debtors and the
successor entities under the Plan expressly reserve the right to pursue or adopt
any Claims not so waived, relinquished, released, compromised or settled that is
alleged in any lawsuit in which the Debtors are a defendant or an interested
party, against any person or entity, including, without limitation, the
plaintiffs or co-defendants in such lawsuits.

         Any Person to whom the Debtors have incurred an obligation (whether on
account of services, purchase or sale of goods or otherwise), or who has
received services from the Debtors or a transfer of money or property of the
Debtors, or who has transacted business with the Debtors, or leased equipment or
property from the Debtors should assume that such obligation, transfer, or
transaction may be reviewed by the Debtors subsequent to the Effective Date and
may, to the extent not theretofore waived, relinquished, released, compromised
or settled, be the subject of an action after the Effective Date, whether or not
(i) such Person has Filed a proof of Claim against the Debtors in the Chapter 11
Cases; (ii) such Person's proof of Claim has been objected to; (iii) such
Person's Claim was included in the Debtors' Schedules; or (iv) such Person's
scheduled Claim has been objected to by the Debtors or has been identified by
the Debtors as disputed, contingent, or unliquidated.

F.       Discharge of Claims and Termination of Equity Interests

Liquidating Debtors: (1) the rights afforded herein and the treatment of all
Claims and Equity Interests herein, shall be in exchange for and in complete
satisfaction, discharge and release of Claims and Equity Interests of any nature
whatsoever, including any interest accrued on Claims from and after the Petition

properties, (2) on the Effective Date, all such Claims against, and Equity
Interests in, the Reorganizing or Reorganized Debtors shall be satisfied,

their assets or properties any other or further Claims or Equity Interests based
upon any act or omission, transaction or other activity of any kind or nature
that occurred prior to the Confirmation Date.

G.       Injunction
