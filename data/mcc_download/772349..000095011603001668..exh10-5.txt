                                    Preamble

         This 12/02 Amendment to the Senior Secured Credit Agreement dated as of
December 18, 2002 (the "12/02 Amendment") amending the 3/02 Amended and Restated
Senior Secured Credit Agreement dated March 15, 2002 (the "3/02 Credit
Agreement", as supplemented by the 10/02 Supplement, as amended hereby and as it
may be further supplemented, further amended or restated from time to time, the
"Current Credit Agreement" or, within itself, this "Agreement"), among:

         AMERICAN BUSINESS CREDIT, INC. ("ABC"), a Pennsylvania corporation,
         HOMEAMERICAN CREDIT, INC. ("HAC"), a Pennsylvania corporation doing
         business under the assumed or fictitious name Upland Mortgage, and

         formerly named New Jersey Mortgage & Investment Corp., Inc., TIGER
         RELOCATION COMPANY ("TRC"), a Pennsylvania corporation formerly named

         each with its principal office at BalaPointe Office Centre, 111
         Presidential Boulevard, Suite 215, Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania 19004
         (ABC, HAC, ABMS, TRC, and ABFSR2002 are herein collectively the
         "Companies" and are sometimes individually referred to as a "Company");

         AMERICAN BUSINESS FINANCIAL SERVICES, INC. (the "Parent"), a Delaware
         corporation and owner of all of the capital stock of ABC, which owns
         all of the capital stock of each of the other Companies;

         JPMORGAN CHASE BANK ("Chase"), a New York banking corporation, acting
         herein as a Lender and as agent and representative of the Lenders and
         Eligible Assignees (in that capacity, Chase is called the "Agent"); and

         such other Lender(s) as may from time to time be party to the Current
         Credit Agreement;

         recites and provides as follows:

                                    Recitals

         The parties wish to amend the 3/02 Credit Agreement, as supplemented by
the 10/02 Supplement (as so supplemented, the "Supplemented Credit Agreement")
to extend the maturity of the facility to March 6, 2003 and the Termination Date
to March 5, 2003, to provide for an additional Class R Certificate to be Pledged

used but not defined differently in this Amendment have the same meanings here
as there.

         The Sections of this 12/02 Amendment are numbered to correspond with
the numbers of the Sections of the 3/02 Credit Agreement (and, in one instance,
of the LC Supplement) and are consequently nonsequential.

and other good and valuable consideration paid by each party to each other party

         the Current Credit Agreement, or of the Current Credit Agreement
         itself, for so long as the Lenders or any of them have any LC Exposure,
         all provisions of the Current Credit Agreement, including this LC
         Supplement, except only those permitting the Companies to borrow or to
         obtain new Letters of Credit (or any modifications, extensions,
         reissuances or replacements of existing Letters of Credit), shall
         remain in full force and effect to the same effect as if such
         expiration or termination had not occurred, including, but not limited
         to, the obligations of the Companies to maintain Collateral for the LC
         Exposure, to timely pay all of their liabilities under the Current

         remedies, powers, options and privileges provided for in or
         contemplated by the Current Credit Agreement, all such applications and
         other agreements and all Security Instruments or other Facilities
         Papers and under applicable Law.
