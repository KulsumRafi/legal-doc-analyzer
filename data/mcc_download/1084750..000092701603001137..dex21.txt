     dividing: (A) $6,111,390.60 (the total liquidation preference of the Series
     A-P Preferred Stock) by (B) $23,750,159.60 (the total liquidation
     preference of the combined Series A-P, B-P, C-P and D Preferred Stock), and

<PAGE>

               (ii) The "Series B-P Per Share Fraction" shall be determined by

     preference of the combined Series A-P, B-P, C-P and D Preferred Stock), and
     dividing that result by 114,161 (the total number of outstanding shares of
     Series B-P Preferred Stock, including any dissenting shares).

               (iii) The "Series C-P Per Share Fraction" shall be determined by
     dividing: (A) $1,542,646.20 (the total liquidation preference of the Series
     C-P Preferred Stock) by (B) $23,750,159.60 (the total liquidation
     preference of the combined Series A-P, B-P, C-P and D Preferred Stock), and
     dividing that result by 530,287 (the total number of outstanding shares of
     Series C-P Preferred Stock, including any dissenting shares).

               (iv) The "Series D Per Share Fraction" shall be determined by
     dividing: (A) $14,843,868 (the total liquidation preference of the Series D
     Preferred Stock) by (B) $23,750,159.60 (the total liquidation preference of
     the combined Series A-P, B-P, C-P and D Preferred Stock), and dividing that
     result by 49,479,567 (the total number of outstanding shares of Series D
     Preferred Stock, including any dissenting shares).

     1.6 Earn-Out.

          (a) Amount of Earn-Out Payment. If the Company has generated more than
$1,125,000 in Earn-out Revenue (as defined below) between February 1 and June
30, 2003 ("Earn-out Period"), then NaviSite will issue to the Avasta
Shareholders as additional consideration the number of shares of NaviSite Common
Stock set forth on Exhibit B hereto (with linear interpolation between the
numbers set forth on Exhibit B in the event that Earn-out Revenue are achieved
at a level in between the numbers set forth therein). The number of shares of
NaviSite Common Stock issued under this Section 1.6, in the aggregate, to the
Avasta Shareholders shall be referred to as the "Earn-out Shares."

     For purposes of this Section 1.6, "Earn-out Revenue" shall mean the sum of
MRR and revenue from transition fees charged in connection with the Company's
contracts involving MRR ("Transition Fees"), measured from the later of contract
execution or February 1, 2003; provided that all contracts generating Earn-out
Revenue must be invoiced by September 30, 2003. (For example, a contract signed
on May 29, 2003 providing for $100,000 in MRR and $50,000 of Transition Fees,
and for which services to the customer begin on June 15, 2003 and invoicing
occurs on June 15, 2003, will result in $250,000 of Earn-out Revenue ($100,000
in MRR in May 2003, $100,000 in MRR in June 2003 and $50,000 in Transition
Fees.)) If Earn-out Shares are issued pursuant to this Section 1.6, they shall
be allocated and distributed to the Avasta Shareholders as follows:

               (i) each share of Series A-P Preferred Stock outstanding
     immediately prior to the Effective Time shall receive that number of shares
     of NaviSite Common Stock equal to the product of multiplying (A) the Series
     A-P Per Share Fraction by (B) the Earnout Shares;

               (ii) each share of Series B-P Preferred Stock outstanding
     immediately prior to the Effective Time shall receive that number of shares
     of NaviSite Common Stock equal to the product of multiplying (A) the Series
     B-P Per Share Fraction by (B) the Earnout Shares;

               (iii) each share of Series C-P Preferred Stock outstanding
     immediately prior to the Effective Time shall receive that number of shares
     of NaviSite Common

                                       -3-

<PAGE>

     Stock equal to the product of multiplying (A) the Series C-P Per Share
     Fraction by (B) the Earnout Shares; and

               (iv) each share of Series D Preferred Stock outstanding
     immediately prior to the Effective Time shall receive that number of shares
     of NaviSite Common Stock equal to the product of multiplying (A) the Series
     D Per Share Fraction by (B) the Earn-out Shares.

          (b) Earn-out Process. The Earn-out Shares (if any) shall be issued
promptly after September 30, 2003. Promptly after September 30, 2003, NaviSite
shall provide a written statement (the "NaviSite Notice") to the Avasta
Shareholders' Agent as to (i) the number of Earn-out Shares to be issued, and
(ii) a summary, in reasonable detail and certified as accurate by the chief
financial officer of NaviSite, as to the calculations supporting the number of
Earn-out Shares to be issued. NaviSite shall permit the Avasta Shareholders'
Agent (or its designees) reasonable access to NaviSite's books and records to
permit the Avasta Shareholders' Agent to verify the accuracy and reasonableness
of the NaviSite Notice. The NaviSite Notice shall be conclusive and binding upon
all parties unless, within 30 days following receipt, the Avasta Shareholders'
Agent notifies NaviSite (the "Objection Notice") in writing that the Avasta
Shareholders' Agent disagrees with the NaviSite Notice. If the parties are in
disagreement following such process, NaviSite's chief financial officer, or his
designee, shall promptly meet with the Avasta Shareholders' Agent, or his
designee, and the parties shall attempt in good faith to reach a resolution of
such disagreement. If such disagreement is not resolved within ten (10) business
days after delivery of the Objection Notice, then the dispute shall be resolved
in accordance with the dispute resolution procedures set forth in Section 9.6.

          (c) Right of Set-Off. NaviSite's obligation to deliver the Earn-out
Shares shall be subject to a right of set-off, such that the number of Earn-out
Shares to be delivered may be reduced by the number of shares deliverable in
connection with indemnification pursuant to Section 9.4 hereof, subject to the
dispute resolution procedures of Section 9.6.

          (d) Certain Earn-out Provisions. NaviSite agrees to the following with
respect to this Section 1.6: (i) prior to February 1, 2003, two additional sales
persons and one additional sales engineer will be provided to the Company as a
resource (either as a new hire or made available by NaviSite), (ii) a pool of
$200,000 (to be paid at the same time the Earn-out Shares are paid) will be made
available as incentive compensation to the Company's senior management team
(excluding joint employees of the Company and NaviSite), tied to the Company's
achieving the maximum Earn-out under this Section 1.6 (to be reduced on a
pro-rata basis in accordance with Exhibit B if the Company achieves less than
the maximum Earn-out) and (iii) acknowledging that it will control the Company
as a whollyowned subsidiary, NaviSite agrees to act in good faith with respect
to such control as it may affect the Earn-out Revenues, and further agrees not
to take any action in bad faith with the purpose of depressing the Earn-out
Revenues.

     1.7 Employee Stock Options. The stock options of the Company are not being
assumed by NaviSite in the Merger. All outstanding Company stock options and
Company warrants to acquire shares of the Company's capital stock shall be
terminated at or prior to the Effective Time. The Company has no stock option
plans other than its Tollgate, Inc. 1999 Stock Option Plan and Tollgate, Inc.
2000 Stock Option Plan.

     1.8 Closing of the Company's Transfer Books. At the Effective Time, holders
of certificates representing shares of the Company's capital stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any
rights as shareholders of the Company, and the stock transfer books of the
Company shall be closed with respect to all shares of such capital stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. No further transfer of any
such shares of the Company's capital

                                      -4-

<PAGE>

stock shall be made on such stock transfer books after the Effective Time. If,
after the Effective Time, a valid certificate previously representing any of
such shares of the Company's capital stock (a "Company Stock Certificate") is
presented to the Surviving Corporation or NaviSite, such Company Stock
Certificate shall be canceled and shall be exchanged as provided in Section 1.9.

     1.9 Exchange of Certificates.

          (a) At or as soon as practicable after the Effective Time, NaviSite
will send to the holders of Company Stock Certificates receiving NaviSite common
stock a letter of transmittal in customary form with instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of Company Stock Certificates in exchange for
certificates representing NaviSite Common Stock. Upon surrender of a Company
Stock Certificate to NaviSite for exchange, together with a duly executed letter
of transmittal and lockup agreement, the holder of such Company Stock
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a certificate
representing the number of whole shares of NaviSite Common Stock that such
holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this Section 1,
and the Company Stock Certificate so surrendered shall be canceled. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this Section 1.9, each Company Stock Certificate
shall be deemed, after the Effective Time, to represent only the right to
receive upon such surrender a certificate representing shares of NaviSite Common
Stock as contemplated by this Section 1. If any Company Stock Certificate shall
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, NaviSite may require the owner of such
lost, stolen or destroyed Company Stock Certificate to provide an appropriate
affidavit as indemnity against any claim that may be made against NaviSite or
the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Company Stock Certificate.

          (b) No dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect
to NaviSite Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be
paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Company Stock Certificate with respect
to the shares of NaviSite Common Stock represented thereby until such holder
surrenders such Company Stock Certificate in accordance with this Section 1.9
(at which time such holder shall be entitled to receive all such dividends and
distributions).

          (c) No fractional shares of NaviSite Common Stock shall be issued in
connection with the Merger; any fractional share shall be rounded down such that
no certificates for any such fractional shares shall be issued.

     1.10 Dissenting Shares.

          (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, any shares of capital stock of the Company that, as of the Effective
Time, are or may become "dissenting shares" within the meaning of Section
1300(b) of the California Corporations Code shall not be converted into or
represent the right to receive NaviSite Common Stock in accordance with Section
1.5, and the holder or holders of such shares shall be entitled only to such
rights as may be granted to such holder or holders in Chapter 13 of the
California General Corporation Law; provided, however, that if the status of any
such shares as "dissenting shares" shall not be perfected, or if any such shares
shall lose their status as "dissenting shares," then, as of the later of the
Effective Time or the time of the failure to perfect such status or the loss of
such status, such shares shall automatically be converted into and shall
represent only the right to receive (upon the surrender of the certificate or
certificates representing such shares) NaviSite Common Stock in accordance with
Section 1.5.

          (b) The Company shall give NaviSite prompt notice of any written
demand received by the Company prior to the Effective Time to require the
Company to purchase shares of capital stock of the Company pursuant to Chapter
13 of the California General Corporation Law and of any other demand, notice or
instrument delivered to the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the

                                      -5-

<PAGE>

California General Corporation Law. The Company shall not make any payment or
settlement offer prior to the Effective Time with respect to any such demand
unless NaviSite shall have consented in writing to such payment or settlement
offer.

     1.11 Tax Consequences. For federal income tax purposes, the Merger is
intended to constitute a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the
Code. The parties to this Agreement hereby adopt this Agreement as a "plan of
reorganization" within the meaning of Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a) of the
United States Treasury Regulations.

     1.12 Further Action. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further
action is determined by NaviSite to be necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation or NaviSite with
full right, title and possession of and to all rights and property of Merger Sub
and the Company, the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation and
NaviSite shall be fully authorized (in the name of Merger Sub, in the name of
the Company and otherwise) to take such action.

acquisition from the Company of any equity securities.

          (c) Section 2.2 of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth the name and

provide funds for, or make any investment in (in the form of a loan, capital
contribution, or otherwise) any corporation, association, other business entity,
or person.

     2.4 Authorization. All corporate action on the part of the Company, its
officers, directors and shareholders necessary for the authorization, execution
and delivery of this Agreement and the performance of all obligations of the
Company under this Agreement has been taken or will be taken prior to the
Closing, and this Agreement constitutes a valid and legally binding obligation
of the Company, enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy

except to the extent that the availability of any equitable remedy is subject to
the discretion of a court.

     2.5 Governmental Consents. No consent, approval, order or authorization of,

<PAGE>

or consultant of the Company has excluded works or inventions made prior to his
or her employment with the Company from his or her assignment of inventions
pursuant to such employee, officer or consultant's proprietary information and
inventions agreement. The Company is not aware that any of its past or current
employees, officers or consultants are in violation thereof, and the Company
will use its best efforts to prevent any such violation. All past or current
vendors of the Company with access to confidential information of the Company
are parties to a written agreement substantially similar to the Proprietary
Information Agreements under which, among other things, each such vendor is
obligated to maintain the confidentiality of information of the Company.

     2.8 Patents and Trademarks.

          (a) Schedule 2.8 lists (i) each patent, patent application, copyright
registration or application therefor, mask work registration or application

application therefor owned or licensed by the Company and (ii) a description of
all components of software developed or in development by the Company,
indicating for each such component its current production status and the
identity of any third party software included in it (provided that for purposes
of this clause (ii), commercially available off-the-shelf software, shrinkwrap
license agreements to which the Company is a party and unregistered copyrights
will be excluded from Schedule 2.8). Schedule 2.8 shall distinguish between
Company Intellectual Property that is owned by the Company, licensed by the
Company from a third party or licensed by the Company to a third party.

          (b) The Company owns or has the right to use all Intellectual Property
used or useful in its business ("Company Intellectual Property"). The Company
Intellectual Property represents all Intellectual Property that is necessary for
the operation of the Company's business as presently conducted. Each item of
Company Intellectual Property will be owned or available for use by the Company
immediately following the Closing on substantially identical terms and
conditions as it was immediately prior to the Closing. The Company has taken all
reasonable measures to protect the proprietary nature of each item of the
Company Intellectual Property, and to maintain in confidence all trade secrets
and confidential information, that it owns or uses. No other person or entity
has any rights to any of the Company Intellectual Property (except pursuant to
agreements or licenses specified on the Disclosure Schedule), and, to the
knowledge of the Company, no other person or entity is infringing, violating or
misappropriating any Company Intellectual Property.

          (c) None of the Customer Deliverables, or the marketing, distribution,
provision or use thereof, materially infringes or violates, or constitutes a
material misappropriation of, any Intellectual Property rights of any person or
entity. None of the Internal Systems, or the use thereof, infringes or violates,
or constitutes a misappropriation of, any Intellectual Property rights of any
person or entity in any material respect. The Company has provided to NaviSite
complete and accurate copies of all written documentation in the Company's
possession relating to any complaint, claim or notice, or written threat
thereof, received by the Company alleging any infringement, violation or
misappropriation known to the Company concerning any Company Intellectual
Property.

          (d) Schedule 2.8(d) identifies each license or other agreement
pursuant to which the Company has licensed, distributed or otherwise granted any
rights to any third party with respect to, any Company Intellectual Property.
Except as described in Schedule 2.8(d), the Company has not agreed to indemnify
any person or entity against any infringement, violation or misappropriation of
any Intellectual Property rights with respect to any Customer Deliverables.

          (e) Schedule 2.8(e) identifies each item of Company Intellectual
Property that is owned by a party other than the Company, and the license or
agreement pursuant to which the

                                      -8-

<PAGE>

Company uses it (excluding off-the-shelf software programs licensed by the
Company pursuant to "shrink wrap" licenses).

          (f) The Customer Deliverables and the Internal Systems are free from
significant defects or programming errors and conform in all material respects
to the written documentation and specifications therefor.

     2.9 Compliance with Other Instruments. The Company is not in violation or
default of any provisions of its Articles or Bylaws or of any material
instrument, mortgage, indenture, agreement, judgment, order, writ, decree, lease
or contract to which it is a party or by which it is bound or, to its knowledge,
of any provision of federal or state statute, rule or regulation applicable to
the Company. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement, and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby will not result
in any violation, which, individually or in the aggregate, would result in a
material and adverse effect on the Company's business or properties, or be in
conflict with or constitute, with or without the passage of time and giving of
notice, either a default under any such provision, instrument, judgment, order,
writ, decree, lease or contract or an event which results in the creation of any
lien, charge or encumbrance upon any assets of the Company or the suspension,
revocation, impairment, forfeiture or nonrenewal of any material permit,
license, authorization or approval applicable to the Company, its business or
operations, or any of its assets or properties.

assemble, license, market or sell its products to any other person or affecting
the Company's exclusive right to develop, manufacture, assemble, distribute,
market or sell its products, or (iv) indemnification by the Company with respect

and proposed transactions involving the same person or entity (including persons
or entities the Company has reason to believe are affiliated therewith) shall be
aggregated for the purpose of meeting the individual minimum dollar amounts of
such subsections.

          (d) There are no agreements, understandings or proposed transactions
between the Company and any of its officers, directors, affiliates or any
affiliate thereof, other than (i) for

payment of salary for services rendered, (ii) reimbursement for reasonable
expenses incurred on behalf of the Company, (iii) warrants held by shareholders
affiliated with the Company's directors Russ Irwin and William del Biaggio, and
(iv) other standard employee benefits made generally available to all employees
(including stock option agreements outstanding under any stock option plan
approved by the Board of Directors of the Company).

          (e) The Company is not a party to and is not bound by any contract,
agreement or instrument, or subject to any restriction under its Articles or
Bylaws, which materially adversely affects its business as now conducted or as
proposed to be conducted, its properties or its financial condition.

          (f) Schedule 2.10(f) sets forth a list of (i) all of the Company's
customers in contract with the Company and (ii) all of the Company's suppliers

          (h) The Company has no indebtedness for borrowed money.

     2.11 Disclosure. The Company has provided NaviSite with all the information
which NaviSite has requested for deciding whether to enter into this Agreement.
Neither this Agreement nor any other documents, exhibits or certificates made or
delivered by or on behalf of the Company in connection herewith or therewith
taken together as a whole contains any untrue statement of a material fact or
omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements herein or
therein not misleading which has not been, prior to the Closing, corrected or
amended and such corrected or amended information provided to NaviSite.

     2.12 Voting Rights. To the Company's knowledge, except as contemplated in
the Company's Amended and Restated Voting Agreement, dated as of October 9,
2002, no shareholder of the Company has entered into any agreement with respect
to the voting of equity securities of the Company.

     2.13 Title to Property and Assets. The Company owns its property and assets
(excluding leased assets) free and clear of all mortgages, liens, loans and
encumbrances, except such encumbrances and liens which arise in the ordinary
course of business and do not materially impair the Company's ownership or use
of such property or assets. With respect to the property and assets it leases,
the Company is in compliance with such leases and, to its knowledge, holds a
valid leasehold interest free of any liens, claims or encumbrances. Schedule

investigations before any governmental entity or before any arbitrator (except
claims for benefits payable in the normal operation of the Company Plans and
proceedings with respect to qualified domestic relations orders) against or
involving any Company Plan or asserting any rights or claims to benefits under
any Company Plan that could give rise to any material liability.

          (d) Each Company Plan which is required to satisfy Section 401(k)(3)

of each Company Plan which is funded are reported at their fair market value on
the books and records of such Company Plan.

          (h) No act or omission has occurred and no condition exists with
respect to any Company Plan that would subject the Company or any ERISA
Affiliate to (i) any material fine, penalty, tax or liability of any kind
imposed under ERISA or the Code or (ii) any contractual indemnification or
contribution obligation protecting any fiduciary, insurer or service provider
with respect to any Company Plan.

Company at any time without liability or expense to the Company or such Company
Plan as a result thereof (other than for benefits accrued through the date of
termination or amendment and reasonable administrative expenses related thereto)

that if, at any time prior to September 30, 2003, any Indemnitee (acting in good
faith) delivers to the Avasta Shareholder a written notice alleging the
existence of an inaccuracy in or a breach of any of the representations and
warranties made by the Company (and setting forth in reasonable detail the basis
for such Indemnitee's belief that such an inaccuracy or breach may exist) and
asserting a claim for recovery under Section 9.2 based on such alleged
inaccuracy or breach, then the claim asserted in such notice shall survive until
such time as such claim is fully and finally resolved.

          (b) The representations and warranties made by NaviSite shall survive
the Closing and shall expire on September 30, 2003; provided, however, that if,
at any time prior to September 30, 2003, any Avasta Indemnitee (acting in good
faith) delivers to NaviSite a written notice alleging the existence of an

the NaviSite (and setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for such
Indemnitee's belief that such an inaccuracy or breach may exist) and asserting a
claim for recovery under Section 9.2 based on such alleged inaccuracy or breach,
then the claim asserted in such notice shall survive until such time as such
claim is fully and finally resolved.

     9.2 Indemnification.

          (a) From and after the Effective Time (but subject to Section 9.1(a)),
the Avasta Shareholders, severally and not jointly, shall hold harmless and
indemnify each of the Indemnitees from and against, and shall compensate and
reimburse each of the Indemnitees for, any Damages which are directly or
indirectly suffered or incurred by any of the Indemnitees or to which any of the
Indemnitees may otherwise become subject (regardless of whether or not such
Damages relate to any third-party claim) and which arise from or as a result of,
or are directly or indirectly connected with:

               (i) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty
     set forth in Section 2 as of the date of this Agreement;

               (ii) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or
     warranty set forth in Section 2 as of the as of the Closing Date;

               (iii) any failure to perform or breach of any covenant or

                                      -25-

<PAGE>

               (iv) any stockholder or former stockholder of the Company seeking
     to exercise his, her or its "dissenters rights" within the meaning of
     Section 1300(b) of the California Corporation's Code;

               (v) any dispute or claim relating to the allocation of NaviSite
     Common Stock among the Avasta Shareholders; or

               (vi) any Legal Proceeding relating to any inaccuracy or breach of
     the type referred to in clauses (i) - (v) above (including any Legal
     Proceeding commenced by any Indemnitee for the purpose of enforcing any of
     its rights under this Section 9).

          (b) From and after the Effective Time (but subject to Section 9.1(b)),
NaviSite shall hold harmless and indemnify each of the Avasta Indemnitees from
and against, and shall compensate and reimburse each of the Indemnitees for, any
Damages which are directly or indirectly suffered or incurred by any of the
Indemnitees or to which any of the Avasta Indemnitees may otherwise become
subject (regardless of whether or not such Damages relate to any third-party
claim) and which arise from or as a result of, or are directly or indirectly
connected with:

               (i) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty
     set forth in Section 3 as of the date of this Agreement;

               (ii) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or
     warranty set forth in Section 3 as of the Closing Date;

               (iii) any failure to perform or breach of any covenant or
     obligation of NaviSite; or

               (iv) any Legal Proceeding relating to any inaccuracy or breach of
     the type referred to in clauses (i) - (iii) above (including any Legal
     Proceeding commenced by any Avasta Indemnitee for the purpose of enforcing
     any of its rights under this Section 9).

          (c) If the Surviving Corporation suffers, incurs or otherwise becomes
subject to any Damages as a result of or in connection with any inaccuracy in or
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or obligation, then (without
limiting any of the rights of the Surviving Corporation as an Indemnitee)
NaviSite shall also be deemed, by virtue of its ownership of the stock of the
Surviving Corporation, to have incurred Damages as a result of and in connection
with such inaccuracy or breach.

     9.3 Threshold; Earn-Out Shares Exclusive Source of Indemnity by the Avasta
Shareholders.

          (a) Neither NaviSite nor the Avasta Shareholders shall be required to
make any indemnification payment pursuant to Section 9.2(a) for any inaccuracy
in or breach of any of their representations and warranties set forth in Section
2 until such time as the total amount of all Damages that have been directly or
indirectly suffered or incurred by any one or more of the Indemnitees exceeds
$100,000 in the aggregate. If the total amount of such Damages exceeds $100,000,
then the Indemnitees (or the Avasta Indemnitees, as the case may be) shall be
entitled to be indemnified against and compensated and reimbursed only for the
portion of such Damages exceeding $100,000.

          (b) The exclusive source of indemnity for the benefit of NaviSite
under this Section 9 shall be the Earn-out Shares not yet issued to the Avasta
Shareholders pursuant to the Earn-out,

                                      -26-

<PAGE>

and in the event that indemnification is due NaviSite, NaviSite shall have the
right to withhold Earn-out Shares from the Avasta Shareholders (pro rata in
accordance with the number of shares of NaviSite Common Stock issued to them at
Closing). No Avasta Shareholder shall have any liability for indemnification
under this Agreement except in the form of such forfeiture of Earn-out Shares.

     9.4 Satisfaction of Indemnification Claim. In the event Avasta Shareholders
shall have any liability to any Indemnitee under this Section 9, NaviSite may
cause such liability to be satisfied (subject to the dispute resolution
procedures of Section 9.6) by withholding from the Avasta Shareholders in
accordance with the provisions of this Section 9 that number of Earn-out Shares
determined by dividing (a) the aggregate dollar amount of such liability by (b)
the fair market value of NaviSite's Common Stock as of the date the notice
provided for in this Section 9.4 is delivered, as determined in good faith by
NaviSite's Board of Directors, and multiplying the result by 150%. Prior to
withholding any such shares, NaviSite shall give written notice (the
"Indemnification Notice") to the Avasta Shareholders' Agent, which notice shall
contain (i) a description in reasonable detail as to the amount and nature of
the claim for which NaviSite seeks indemnification and (ii) NaviSite's
determination of the fair market value of the NaviSite Common Stock, together
with justification for such determination in reasonable detail. If the Avasta
Shareholders' Agent does not contest the Indemnification Notice within 30 days,
then NaviSite shall be conclusively entitled to withhold Earn-out Shares from
distribution to the Avasta Shareholders as provided above (without the 150%
multiple). If the Avasta Shareholders' Agent does contest the Indemnification
Notice by providing an Objection Notice to NaviSite within 30 days of receipt of
the Indemnification Notice (which Objection Notice may dispute, without
limitation, either the Damages asserted by NaviSite or the fair market value of
NaviSite Common Stock claimed by NaviSite), then the parties rights will be
determined in accordance with the dispute resolution procedures of Section 9.6.
In such event, and notwithstanding the foregoing, the fair market value of
NaviSite's Common Stock for purposes of satisfying any claim for indemnification
under this Section 9 shall be finally determined as of the date such shares are
delivered to NaviSite in satisfaction of such claim.

     9.5 Defense of Third Party Claims. In the event of the assertion or
commencement by any Person of any claim or Legal Proceeding (whether against the
Surviving Corporation, against NaviSite or against any other Person) with
respect to which any of the Avasta Shareholders may become obligated to hold
harmless, indemnify, compensate or reimburse any Indemnitee pursuant to this
Section 9, NaviSite shall have the right to proceed with the defense of such
claim or Legal Proceeding. If NaviSite so proceeds with the defense of any such
claim or Legal Proceeding:

          (a) all reasonable expenses relating to the defense of such claim or
Legal Proceeding shall be borne and paid exclusively by the Avasta Shareholders
(but only by forfeiture of Earn-Out Shares); and

          (b) NaviSite shall have the right to settle, adjust or compromise such
claim or Legal Proceeding with the consent of the Avasta Shareholders' Agent (as
defined in Section 11.1); provided, however, that such consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld.

          (c) NaviSite shall give the Avasta Shareholders' Agent prompt notice
of the commencement of any such Legal Proceeding against NaviSite or the
Surviving Corporation; provided, however, that any failure on the part of
NaviSite to so notify the Avasta Shareholders' Agent shall not limit any of the
obligations of the Avasta Shareholders under this Section 9 (except to the
extent such failure materially prejudices the defense of such Legal Proceeding).

                                      -27-

     9.6 Dispute Resolution.

          (a) In case the Avasta Shareholders' Agent delivers an Objection
Notice in accordance with Section 1.6 or Section 9.4, or the parties hereto are
otherwise in dispute over a matter relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, the Avasta Shareholders' Agent and NaviSite
shall attempt in good faith for a period of 30 days to agree upon the rights of
the respective parties with respect to each of such claims.

          (b) If no such agreement can be reached within such 30 day period
after good faith negotiation, then such dispute shall be resolved pursuant to
the neutral binding alternative dispute resolution process ("ADR Process")
described below. In such event, any Party (acting together or individually)
shall submit a notice of such dispute ("Notice of Dispute") to JAMS (defined
below) which notice sets forth the details of the disputes) and requests JAMS to
implement the ADR Process set forth below.

     9.7 ADR Process. The Notice Of Dispute shall be delivered to the San
Francisco office of Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Service ("JAMS") for
binding resolution pursuant to the ADR Process. The ADR Process shall be
conducted according to the following procedure:

          (a) The ADR Process shall be conducted in San Francisco, California.

          (b) JAMS shall promptly select a single retired California Superior
Court Judge to be the hearing officer ("Hearing Officer"). The Hearing Officer
shall not have any actual or perceived conflict of interest with any Party to
this Agreement, or to any Affiliate or subsidiary or their respective counsel
and absent any conflict, no Party shall have the right to object to the Hearing
Officer. The Hearing Officer shall have extensive and recent civil trial
experience and shall not have been primarily a criminal courts judge during
his/her career. The first hearing day shall be scheduled not later than thirty
(30) calendar days following appointment of the Hearing Officer and the hearing
process shall be concluded within sixty (60) calendar days from commencement.

          (c) The Hearing Officer shall preside over the ADR Process, shall
accept relevant evidence, and may (in her/her discretion) hear live testimony of
the parties and their expert and other witnesses, examine and cross-examine the
parties and their witnesses, allow counsel to examine and cross-examine
witnesses, to conduct discovery, to hear arguments of counsel, and otherwise
conduct and control a hearing as if he/she were sitting as a California Superior
Court Judge without a jury. At the conclusion of the hearing, the Hearing
Officer shall orally announce a tentative decision as to the disagreement(s)
which form the basis of the dispute. In announcing the tentative decision and in
rendering the Final Award (defined below), the Hearing Officer shall be required
to follow California law in the interpretation of any document or agreement
(including this Agreement), in admitting evidence and in fashioning a remedy.
The Hearing Officer shall not have the power or authority to award any amount in
the nature or character of punitive or exemplary damages, but shall have the
power to issue an award for compensatory damages based on breach or default of
the Agreement, shall have the power to issue injunctive or other equitable
relief where appropriate, and shall have the power to issue an award for
attorneys' fees and costs as allowed by this Agreement.

          (d) Within thirty (30) calendar days following conclusion of the oral
hearing, the Hearing Officer shall prepare and deliver to each of the parties a
written decision, accompanied by a statement of facts, law, underlying reasons
and conclusions necessary to fully explain his/her decision ("Final Award"). If
the Final Award requires payment by one party of any amount of money to the
other

                                      -28-

<PAGE>

party, the Hearing Officer shall require that payment be made within thirty (30)
calendar days following issuance of the Final Award, and, if payment is not
timely made, the Final Award shall provide the party to whom payment is due with
the right but not the obligation to seek immediate enforcement of the Final
Award by a court of competent jurisdiction.

          (e) The Final Award shall be final and binding on each party to the
dispute, shall be admissible in any court of law for any purpose reasonably
related thereto (including, but not limited to, for the purpose of determining
whether or not a breach or default under the Agreement has occurred), and either
party may petition the California Superior Court to enter the Final Award as the
final judgment and award of the court and/or to enforce enforcement of a Final
Award.

          (f) Each party shall pay one-half of the fees and costs for JAMS and
the Hearing Officer. If advance payment or deposit is required prior to
commencement of the ADR Process, each party to the dispute hereby represents and
warrants that it will timely pay and deposit said amount. The failure to timely
pay any amounts requested by the Hearing Officer of JAMS shall constitute an
immediate and material event of default and if said amounts are not timely paid
following receipt of a five (5) business day notice and demand to pay, the
Hearing Officer shall be required (without the taking of any evidence or
testimony) to issue a Final Award in favor of the party to the dispute timely
paying its fees, on the terms and conditions requested by said party, which
shall be final and binding.

          (a) In the event NaviSite proposes to file a Registration Statement at
any time during the period beginning on the six-month anniversary of the Closing

prior to such filing, give written notice to all former stockholders of Avasta
who received Merger Shares in the Merger (each a "Merger Holder") of its
intention to do so; provided, that no such notice need be given if no shares
other than those sold for the account of NaviSite are to be included therein as
a result of advice from the managing underwriter pursuant to Section 10.2. Upon
the written request of a Merger Holder given within 10 days after NaviSite
provides such notice (which request shall state the intended method of
disposition of such Merger Shares), NaviSite shall use best efforts to cause all
Merger Shares which NaviSite has been requested by such Merger Holder to
register to be included in such registration; provided that NaviSite shall have
the right, in its sole discretion, to delay the filing of, postpone, suspend the
effectiveness of (and require that the Merger Holders immediately cease sales of
shares pursuant to the Registration Statement), or withdraw any registration
effected pursuant to this Section 10.1 without obligation to any Merger Holder.

          (b) In the event NaviSite proposes to file a Registration Statement at
any time during the period beginning on the Earn-out Registration Trigger Date
and ending on the nine-month anniversary of the Earn-out Registration Trigger
Date, NaviSite will, prior to such filing, give written notice to all former
stockholders of Avasta who received Earn-out Shares in the Merger (each a
"Earn-out Holder"; together with the Merger Holders; the "Holders") of its
intention to do so; provided, that no such notice need be given if no shares
other than those sold for the account of NaviSite are to be included therein as
a result of advice from the managing underwriter pursuant to Section 10.2. Upon
the written request of an Earn-out Holder given within 10 days after NaviSite
provides such notice (which request shall state the intended method of
disposition of such Earn-out Shares), NaviSite shall use best efforts to cause
all Earnout Shares which NaviSite has been requested by such Earn-out Holder to
register to be included in such registration; provided that NaviSite shall have
the right, in its sole discretion, to delay the filing of, postpone, suspend the
effectiveness of (and require that the Earn-out Holders immediately cease sales

shares pursuant to the Registration Statement), or withdraw any registration
effected pursuant to this Section 10.1 without obligation to any Earn-out
Holder.

          (c) If such registration pursuant to subsections (a) or (b) above is a
CBA Registration Statement, the Holders shall have the right to include the
percentage of such Holder's total number of Merger Shares and/or Earn-out Shares
as is equal to the percentage of the total number of CBA's NaviSite Common Stock
to be included in the registration relative to all shares of NaviSite Common
Stock held by CBA (on a fully-diluted basis).

     10.2 Underwritten Offering.

          (a) If the registration for which NaviSite gives notice pursuant to
Section 10.1 is a registered public offering involving an underwriting, NaviSite
shall so advise the applicable Holders as a part of the written notice given
pursuant to Section 10.1. In such event, (i) the right of any Holder to include
its Shares in such registration pursuant to this Section 10.2 shall be
conditioned upon such Holder's participation in such underwriting on the terms
set forth herein and (ii) all Holders including Shares in such registration
shall enter into an underwriting agreement upon customary terms with the
underwriter or underwriters selected for the underwriting by NaviSite. If any
Holder who has requested inclusion of its Shares in such registration as
provided above disapproves of the terms of the underwriting, such Holder may
elect, by written notice to NaviSite, to withdraw his, her or its Shares from
such Registration Statement and underwriting. If the managing underwriter
advises NaviSite that marketing factors require a limitation on the number of
shares to be underwritten, the Shares held by the Holders shall be first
excluded from such Registration Statement and underwriting (in proportion, as
nearly as practicable, to the respective number of Merger Shares held by all
Holders on the date NaviSite gave the applicable notice specified in Section
10.1 above) to the extent deemed advisable by the managing underwriter.

          (b) Notwithstanding Section 10.2(a) above, in the case of an
underwritten offering relating to a CBA Registration Statement, in the event the
managing underwriter advises NaviSite that marketing factors require a
limitation on the number of shares to be underwritten, the Shares held by the
Holders shall be reduced by the same relative percentage as the reduction in the
number of shares of CBA's NaviSite Common Stock to be included in such
registration.

          (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, NaviSite shall not be required,
pursuant to this Section 10.2, to include any Shares in a Registration Statement
if such Shares are eligible for sale under Rule 144 under the Securities Act.

     10.3 Holder Information. NaviSite shall not be required to include any
Shares in a Registration Statement unless:

          (a) each Holder owning such Shares to be included in the Registration
Statement provides to NaviSite in writing such information regarding such Holder
and the proposed sale of Shares by such Holder as NaviSite may reasonably
request in writing in connection with the Registration Statement or as shall be
required in connection therewith by the SEC or any state securities law
authorities;

          (b) such Holder shall have provided to NaviSite his/her or its written
agreement:

               (i) to indemnify NaviSite and each of its directors and officers
     against, and hold NaviSite and each of its directors and officers harmless
     from, any losses, claims, damages, expenses or liabilities (including
     reasonable attorneys fees) to which NaviSite

                                      -30-

<PAGE>

     or such directors and officers may become subject by reason of any
     statement or omission in the Registration Statement made in reliance upon,
     or in conformity with, a written statement by such Holder furnished
     pursuant to this Section 10; and

               (ii) to report to NaviSite sales made by such Holder pursuant to
     the Registration Statement.

     10.4 Indemnity. NaviSite agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Holder
whose Shares are included in a Registration Statement against any losses,
claims, damages, expenses or liabilities to which such Holder may become subject
by reason of any untrue statement of a material fact contained in the
Registration Statement or any omission to state therein a fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading,
except insofar as such losses, claims, damages, expenses or liabilities arise
out of or are based upon information furnished to NaviSite by or on behalf of a
Holder for use in the Registration Statement. NaviSite shall have the right to
assume the defense and settlement of any claim or suit for which NaviSite may be
responsible for indemnification under this Section 10.

     10.5 Assignment. A Holder may not assign any of its rights under this
Section 10 except in connection with the transfer of some or all of his, her or
its Shares to a child or spouse, or trust for their benefit or, in the case of a
partnership, limited liability company or corporation, to its partners, members
or stockholders, respectively, pursuant to a pro rata distribution of its
Shares, provided each such transferee agrees in a written instrument delivered
to NaviSite to be bound by the provisions of this Section 10.

SECTION 11. Miscellaneous Provisions

     11.1 Avasta Shareholders' Agent. Convergence Partners shall be the agent of
the Avasta Shareholders for all purposes under this Agreement after the Closing,
including without limitation determinations under Sections 1.6 and Section 9
(the "Avasta Shareholders' Agent"). NaviSite shall be entitled to deal
exclusively with the Avasta Shareholders' Agent on all matters under this
Agreement (including without limitation under Sections 1.6 and Section 9), and
shall be entitled to rely conclusively (without further evidence of any kind
whatsoever) on any document executed or purported to be executed on behalf of
any Avasta Shareholder by the Avasta Shareholders' Agent, and on any other
action taken or purported to be taken on behalf of any Avasta Shareholder by the
Avasta Shareholders' Agent, as fully binding upon such Avasta Shareholder. If
the Avasta Shareholders' Agent shall for any reason be unwilling or unable to
fulfill its responsibilities as agent of the Avasta Shareholders, then the
Avasta Shareholders shall, within ten days after such death or disability,
appoint a successor agent and, promptly thereafter, shall notify NaviSite of the
identity of such successor. Any such successor shall become the "Avasta
Shareholders' Agent" for purposes of Section 9 and this Section 11.1. If for any
reason there is no Avasta Shareholders' Agent at any time, all references herein
to the Avasta Shareholders' Agent shall be deemed to refer to the Avasta
Shareholders.

     11.2 Further Assurances. Each party hereto shall execute and cause to be
delivered to each other party hereto such instruments and other documents, and

of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

     11.3 Fees and Expenses; Cooley Godward Fees and Expenses. Each party to
this Agreement shall bear and pay all fees, costs and expenses (including legal
fees and accounting fees) that have been incurred or that are incurred by such

Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement, NaviSite

                                      -31-

<PAGE>

agrees that, in the event the parties to this Agreement break off negotiations
(for any reason) with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, NaviSite
will be responsible for and will promptly pay Cooley Godward LLP's ("Cooley
Godward") actual fees and costs incurred by the Company on and after November 1,
2002, up to a maximum obligation of $25,000 and NaviSite agrees that this
obligation will survive any termination of this Agreement. In the event that the
Merger is consummated, NaviSite will be responsible for and will pay at Closing
all of Cooley Godward's actual fees and costs incurred by the Company on and
after November 1, 2002, up to an aggregate maximum amount (for both fees and
costs) of $85,000. The Company will cause Cooley Godward to provide NaviSite
with regular updates as to the amount of fees and costs incurred (within the
limitations of Cooley Godward's intra-month billing system).

     11.4 Attorneys' Fees. If any action or proceeding relating to this
Agreement or the enforcement of any provision of this Agreement is brought
against any party hereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover
reasonable attorneys' fees, costs and disbursements (in addition to any other
relief to which the prevailing party may be entitled).
