<BR>
</B>2.2  The Merger shall have the effect provided therefor by the General Corporation Law. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at Closing (i) all the rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises, of a public as well as of a private nature, and all property, real, personal and mixed, and all debts due on whatever account, including without limitation subscriptions to shares, and all other choses in action, and all and every other interest of or belonging to or due to Atlas or the Acquirer, as a group, subject to the terms hereof, shall be taken and deemed to be transferred to, and vested in, the Surviving Company without further act or deed; and all property, rights and privileges, immunities, powers and franchises and all and every other interest shall be thereafter as effectually the property of the Surviving Company, as they were of Atlas and the Acquirer, as a group, and (ii) all debts, liabilities, duties and obligations of Atlas and the Acquirer, as a group, subject to the terms hereof, shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Company and the Surviving Company shall thenceforth be responsible and liable for all debts, liabilities, duties and obligations of Atlas and the Acquirer, as a group, and neither the rights of creditors nor any liens upon the property of Atlas or the Acquirer, as a group, shall be impaired by the Merger, and may be enforced against the Surviving Company. <BR>
<BR>

<BR>
</B>2.3  The Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Company from and after the Closing shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of Atlas until thereafter amended in accordance with the provisions therein and as provided by the applicable provisions of the General Corporation Law.  The Bylaws of the Surviving Company from and after the Closing shall be the Bylaws of the Acquirer as in effect immediately prior to the Closing, continuing until thereafter amended in accordance with their terms, the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Company and as provided by the General Corporation Law.

<BR>
<B>Conversion of Securities<BR>
<BR>
</B>2.4  At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Atlas or the Acquirer, the shares of capital stock of each of Atlas and the Acquirer shall be converted as follows:<BR>
<BR>
(a)<U> Capital Stock of the Acquirer</U>. Each issued and outstanding share of the Acquirers capital stock shall continue to be issued and outstanding and shall be converted into one share of validly issued, fully paid, and non assessable common stock of the Surviving Company. Each stock certificate of the Acquirer evidencing ownership of any such shares shall continue to evidence ownership of such shares of capital stock of the Surviving Company.<BR>
<BR>
(b) <U>Conversion of Atlas Shares</U>. Each Atlas Share that is issued and outstanding at the Effective Time shall automatically be cancelled and extinguished and converted, without any action on the part of the holder thereof, into the right to receive at the time and in the amounts described in this Agreement an amount of Acquisition Shares equal to the number of Acquisition Shares divided by the number of the Atlas<U> </U>Shares outstanding immediately prior to Closing. All such Atlas<U> </U>Shares, when so converted, shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate representing any such shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Acquisition Shares paid in consideration therefor upon the surrender of such certificate in accordance with this Agreement.<BR>
<BR>
2.5  Platoro agrees that it is acquiring the Acquisition Shares for investment purposes and will not offer, sell or otherwise transfer, pledge or hypothecate any of the Acquisition Shares issued to it (other than pursuant to an effective registration statement under the <I>Securities Act</I>) directly or indirectly unless:<BR>
<BR>
(a) the sale is to Quincy;<BR>
<BR>
(b) the sale is made pursuant to the exemption from registration under the <I>Securities Act,</I> provided by Rule 144 thereunder; or<BR>

<BR>
Platoro acknowledges that the certificate representing the Acquisition Shares shall bear the following legend:<BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933.  THE SHARES HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED FOR INVESTMENT.
