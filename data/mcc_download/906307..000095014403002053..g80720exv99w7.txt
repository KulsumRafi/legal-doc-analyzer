Projected sales continued...

The projections include one new supermarket that was opened in the San Juan
area of Puerto Rico in mid November 2002. No other new stores are included in
the projection.

The projections include the impact of disposing certain under performing stores
at the beginning of the fiscal year that ends on October 29, 2005.

Further, the change in same store sales for the Retail Food Division are
projected based on management's estimate of the impact that the competitive
situation in Puerto Rico will have on sales. In addition to expansion of
locally owned and managed supermarket chains, U. S. food retailers such as
Sam's, Walmart (conventional Walmart stores, Walmart Superstores and Walmart
supermarkets through acquisition of a local supermarket chain), K-mart and
Costco have expanded into the market.

Projected Video Rental Division same store sales have also been adjusted for
the negative impact from increased competition. Additionally, the sales have
been adjusted for the negative impact of competing technological advances in
satellite and pay-per-view television.

GROSS MARGIN:

The rates of gross margin for both the supermarkets and Blockbuster are
projected based on the gross margin trends and sales mix among merchandise
categories developed during the 52 weeks ended November 2, 2002 adjusted for
the projected impact of promotional discounts with both the PuebloCard and the
anticipated competitive situation in Puerto Rico.

Vendor allowances are included in the operations when earned. Consequently, any
upfront money for vendor allowances is amortized over the life of the deal and
the related volume.

SELLING GENERAL & ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES:

Selling General and Administrative expenses are projected based on their fixed
or variable nature.

Variable expenses are projected based on their normal relationship to sales,
changes in that relationship as indicated by trends developed during the 52
weeks ended November 2, 2002, and the impact of contractual changes such as the
new collective Bargaining Agreement effective July 5, 2002.

Variable expenses include salaries (both store and administrative), all
benefits except for pension expense which is projected based on actuarial
estimates, operating supplies, advertising, sales tax, bank card charges,
unrecoverable returned checks, royalty and the cost of transferring tapes from
rental to sell-through in the Video Rental Division. These expenses are offset
by miscellaneous income from services such as money orders, wire transfers,
vending machine, & lottery, which tend to be variable in nature.

Fixed expenses have been projected based on their trend, in dollars, during the
52 weeks ending November 2, 2002. Fixed expenses include utilities, rent,
insurance premiums, the cost of the Company's self insured general liability
program, services, repair and maintenance, real and personal property tax
payments, communications, non-salary type administrative expenses, and other
miscellaneous expenses. Any fixed expenses with contractual obligations, such
as leases, have been projected based on the contract. Additionally, increases
have been projected based on anticipated increases in insurance premiums,
property tax rates, utility costs, and inflation.

EBITDA (EARNINGS BEFORE NET INTEREST, INCOME TAXES, DEPRECIATION AND
AMORTIZATION):

EBITDA per the accompanying Consolidated Operating Statement does not include,
by definition, any cost of the rental tapes of the Video Rental Division as
they are amortized over twelve months. Such costs are integral to the success
of the business and are on-going annually. Consequently, to determine earnings
before net interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization but after the
cost of the rental tapes it is necessary to adjust EBITDA, as depicted below,
for the cost of the tapes:

LOSS ON DISPOSAL OF UNDER-PERFORMING STORES:

The projection includes the disposal of six under-performing stores at the
beginning of the fiscal year ending October 29, 2005.

The loss on the disposal is based on the transaction involving the purchaser
assuming all leases and paying for the inventory at cost net of the related
accounts payable the purchaser assumes. Consequently the loss on disposal is
computed as follows:

DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION:

With the exception of goodwill amortization, depreciation and amortization are
projected on the future depreciation and amortization of assets in place and
applying the company's depreciation policies to the capital expenditures
outlined in the Consolidated Cash Flow section.

In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 142
which, when adopted, will result in no longer amortizing goodwill. Rather,
recorded goodwill will be periodically evaluated and, should that evaluation
indicate that the value of goodwill is less than that recorded an adjustment
will be made to reduce its recorded value. The company will be adopting this
accounting pronouncement during the fiscal year ending November 1, 2003.

For the sake of comparability, depreciation and amortization expense herein,
for all years presented (including the actual results for the fiscal year that
ended November 2, 2002), have been adjusted to exclude any amortization of
goodwill as if the new accounting rule had been adopted before the earliest
year presented.

facility on January 31, 2003 and refinancing the Company's remaining debt on
May 17, 2003:

New Bank Facility to provide:

         -        A Revolving Credit Facility - the Company's borrowings under
                  the revolver varies each period in these projections by
                  borrowing enough to maintain a minimum $3.0 in book cash.
                  Interest on the revolver borrowings is 6.0% per annum for the
                  first 12 months of the agreement and 7.0% per annum
                  thereafter.

         -        Three Term Loans totaling $43.5 bearing annual interest at
                  7.0% per annum for the first 12 months and 8.0% per annum

INCOME TAXES:

The fluctuations in the effective tax rates for the projected years are a
result of the variance in rates in the various tax jurisdictions that the
Company's operating subsidiaries do business in, the items of permanent
difference between financial reporting of income and tax reporting of income,
the utilization of the net operating loss carry-forwards ("NOL's") of the
Company's operating subsidiaries in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands tax
jurisdictions and the interplay of utilizing those NOL's and the foreign tax
credit available on the Company's consolidated U.S. tax return.

The taxes projected to be paid, (refunded) when the related tax returns are
filed are as follows (dollars in millions):

For the 52 Weeks ending:

         11/01/03    $(1.1)

</TABLE>

Based on the tax basis of the Company's assets and liabilities and the
pertinent sections of the United States Internal Revenue Code the gain will not
be taxed at the time of the reorganization nor will the tax basis of its assets
be reduced in the future. Consequently, no income taxes have been provided on
the gain.

RESTRUCTURING COSTS:

Restructuring costs include the projected professional fees of the Debtor
(Nutritional Sourcing Corporation) and the noteholders from the time the
Chapter 11 proceeding commenced through May 17, 2003. The professional fees
include the costs of legal counsel and financial advisors to both.

The costs of legal counsel and bank fees associated with the new bank facility
for the Debtor's operating subsidiaries is not included in restructuring costs.
These costs are capitalized and amortized as part of interest over the 5-year
term of the new bank facility.

EBITDA:

An analysis of EBITDA may be found in the EBITDA section of the EXPLANATORY
COMMENTS & ASSUMPTIONS to the Projected Consolidated Operating Statement.

EXISTING REVOLVER:

During the fiscal year ended November 2, 2002 $2.0 was borrowed under the
existing revolver. This money was repaid in $1.0 payments during the first two
periods of the fiscal year ending November 1, 2003.

The existing revolver balance of $30.0 will be purchased by a new bank lender
on or about January 31, 2003. The new lender will also provide term loan
financing to the operating subsidiaries at the time the Debtor emerges from
Chapter 11.

NEW REVOLVER:

Borrowings under the new revolver will initially be $30.0 when a new lender
purchases the existing debt from the existing bank lenders. The terms of the
new revolver are discussed in the NEW REVOLVER section of the EXPLANATORY
COMMENTS & ASSUMPTIONS to the Consolidated Balance Sheet Projection.

CONSIDERATION TO EXISTING NOTEHOLDERS AND NEW 10.125% SIX YEAR NOTES:

The consideration to existing noteholders is described in the EXTRAORDINARY ITEM
section of the EXPLANATORY COMMENTS & ASSUMPTIONS to the Projected
Consolidating Operating Statement. The new notes are part of that
consideration.


                                                                             15

RESTRUCTURING COSTS, UNEARNED RETAINERS & NEW REVOLVER AND TERM LOAN FEES AND
EXPENSES:

The restructuring costs and unearned retainers are related. Restructuring costs
include the projected professional fees of the Debtor (Nutritional Sourcing
Corporation) and the noteholders from the time the Chapter 11 proceeding
commenced through May 17, 2003. The professional fees include the costs of legal
counsel and financial advisors to both.

Unearned retainers are the portion of the retainers paid to the Debtor's
professionals prior to November 2, 2002 that were unearned as of that date.
These fees and the $3.5 of restructuring costs during the year ending November
1, 2003 comprise the total of $4.5 in restructuring costs projected to be
expensed in the Projected Operating Statement during the fiscal year ending
November 1, 2003.

The new revolver and term loan fees and expenses are the estimated bank and
legal costs associated with the new bank facility discussed in the New Revolver
and New Term Loans sections of the EXPLANATORY COMMENTS & ASSUMPTIONS to the
Projected Consolidated Balance Sheet. These costs will be deferred and
amortized to interest expense over the 5 year term of the New Revolver and New
Term Loans.

AMORTIZATION OF CAPITAL LEASES:

This is the principal portion of the lease payments for existing capital leases
based on their terms and amortization schedule. No new capital leases are
projected.

INVESTED FUNDS are invested in money management accounts and currently earning
interest at between 1.82% and 2.08% annually. Invested funds as of the balance
sheet dates in the Projection are a "result" of the assumptions for other cash
funds.

STORE DEPOSITORY ACCOUNTS are cash from sales that have not been transferred to
the investment accounts. Projected amounts have been held constant with the
prior year actual as they do not vary significantly.

ACCOUNTS PAYABLE DISBURSEMENT ACCOUNT AND PAYROLL ACCOUNT represents checks
issued that have not cleared as of the balance sheet date. When presented for
payment the funds are "swept" from the investment accounts to pay them. These
disbursements are held constant in the Projection as the Company expects the
same level of weekly payments in future periods as was made at the end of the
fiscal year ended November 2, 2002.

IN-STORE FUNDS are the on-hand cash at the stores for safe funds, cash register
drawer funds and petty cash. They are held constant in the Projection as they
will not vary significantly even with a new supermarket and a new Blockbuster
at the beginning of the 52 weeks ending November 1, 2003.

</TABLE>

VENDORS represents the receivables from primarily inventory vendors for coupons
and deal money billed to the vendor rather than deducted at the time of paying
vendor invoices. Deal money obtained through billing the vendor will vary
depending on the vendor, the time of year and the type of promotion the vendor
is running. During the 52 weeks ended November 3, 2001, the Company agreed that
Topco would keep the dividend it normally pays during the year as a credit
enhancement rather than paying it to the Company. This dividend receivable is
also in vendor receivables. The projected receivable balances are based on the
operating plan activity involving the items that result in receivables from
vendors.

TENANTS is the receivable from the 300 + retail tenants and subtenants at the
Company's supermarket locations. The projection anticipates that tenant
receivables will remain consistent with the level existing as of November 2,
2002.

EXTENDED VIEWING FEES are receivables from customers of the Video Rental
Division for late fees for returning rented videos after the time allotted for
the original rental fee. Extended viewing fees have declined as a result of
more aggressive collections efforts. The projection anticipates that tenant
receivables will remain consistent with the level existing as of November 2,
2002.

GIFT CERTIFICATES are receivables for gift certificates sold, primarily, to
corporate customers for the benefit of their employees. The projection
anticipates that they will remain constant throughout the plan period.

ALL OTHER receivables in the Projection are held constant with the actual
balance at the end of the fiscal year ended November 2, 2002.

COST represents landed costs (ie.: vendor invoice costs, freight-in, import
taxes) and an up-charge for the management services of the Company's Traffic
Department. For Blockbuster cost includes video tapes and games purchased for
rental which are amortized (see accumulated amortization).

For projected periods, supermarket inventory cost has been determined based on
the operating projection. Purchases are based on the ensuing month's cost of
sales at the "bill-out" level and relief from inventory is based on the current
month's "bill-out". In the case of the new store, which opened in the 1(st)
period of the 52 weeks ending November 1, 2003, the initial inventory of $1.0
million is purchased one period prior to the period the store commences
operations.

COST (CONTINUED)

For projected periods Blockbuster non-rental tapes and games inventory cost has
been determined based on the operating projection. Purchases are based on the
ensuing month's cost of sales at the "bill-out" level and relief from inventory
is based on the current month's "bill-out". In the case of the new store, which
opened in the 1(st) period of the 52 weeks ending November 1, 2003, the initial
inventory of $0.1 million is purchased one period prior to the period the store
commences operations. The additions to inventory are based on the purchases of
rental tapes and games per the cash flow plan. For the 5 years being projected,
rental tape purchases are projected to total $5.6 million, $5.6 million, $5.7
million, $5.9 million, and $5.8 million and are spread equally across the 13
Periods.

Relief from Blockbuster inventory for the historical cost of rental video tapes
and games damaged, lost or put up for sale as previously viewed tapes is based
on the operating projection cost of these three categories of expense and the
historical relationship of that cost to the historical relief from inventory
for them which is 16.64% of the three expenses combined.

SHRINKAGE RESERVE is the reserve the Company establishes, based on experience,
for the loss of inventory in the departments accounted for on the retail
method. Loss of inventory results from theft, spoilage and billing errors. The
reserve is established for each store based on each stores average rate of
shrinkage (retail value of lost inventory divided by the retail value of sales
for the period between physical inventory counts) for the last three physical
inventories. Any difference between the shrinkage reserve and the actual
shrinkage determined on the basis of physical inventory counts is charged to
operations at the time it is determined. Physical inventories of the retail
departments (grocery, health and beauty care/general merchandise, and dairy)
are done at least twice annually in each store.

No shrinkage reserve is recorded for the inventories of the departments
accounted for on a cost basis (meat, produce, bakery and deli) as the physical
inventories for each of these departments, in each store, are done at the end
of each accounting period and any shrinkage is charged to operations in that
period.

The shrinkage reserve for all periods in the Projection is based on the actual
relationship of the reserve to gross inventory at cost for the fiscal year
ended November 2, 2002, which was 2.3% in both Puerto Rico the U. S. Virgin
Islands.


                                                                            28

CONTRA - TRAFFIC INCOME RESERVE is a reserve established to reduce the value of
reported inventory at the balance sheet date for the internal up-charge in Cost
(discussed above) for the services of the Company's Traffic Department. The
reserves for the projection period were established on the basis of it's actual
average historical relationship (0.82% in the Retail Food Division) to gross
inventory at cost for the supermarkets for the 52 week year ended November 2,
2002.

IN-TRANSIT inventory is the cost value of inventory that the company has taken
title to but has not yet taken possession of in either Puerto Rico or the U.S.
Virgin Islands. The amount of inventory in-transit for the projection is based
on the actual average historical relationship (12.16% in the Retail Food
Division) of in-transit inventory to the ensuing month's purchases for the 52
weeks ended November 2, 2002.

DIVERTER/EXPORT INVENTORY is inventory which was bought specifically to sell to
other retailers in the Caribbean exclusive of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin
Islands. The amount of such inventory on hand is usually minor. Consequently,
the inventory throughout the projections has been held constant with the
balance as of November 2, 2002.

SLOW MOVING RESERVE is the reserve established to reduce the cost of slow
moving inventory to its net realizable value. This reserve is established based
on specific identification of items in the Company's Puerto Rico warehouse in
excess of supply based on recent and projected movement. The value of the
reserve is determined on the basis of the estimated mark-downs that will be
taken to sell the inventory. For the projections, the reserve has been held
constant with the balance as of November 2, 2002.

LIFO RESERVE is the reserve established to reduce the cost of certain inventory
to its value using the Last-in First-out accounting convention. Approximately
89% of the Retail Food Division inventory is accounted for using this
convention. The remainder of the Retail Food Division Inventory is accounted
for using the First-in, First-out accounting convention. The reserve was
analyzed in detail as of the end of the Fiscal Year ended November 2, 2002 and
was established at $2.2 in Puerto Rico and $0.4 in the U.S. Virgin Islands.
Historically adjustments to the reserve have been minor. Consequently, the
reserve has been held constant throughout the projections.

STEP UP IN BASIS is the amount established at the time of the Company's
acquisition in July 1993 to increase the value of inventories accounted for
using the LIFO convention to their fair market value at that time as required
by generally accepted accounting principals applicable to Purchase Accounting.
Based on the related accounting rules this balance does not change throughout
the projections.

ACCUMULATED AMORTIZATION - RENTAL VIDEO TAPES is the accumulated amortization
on the Video Rental Division rental tapes and games included in cost. These are
amortized over 13 periods (one year) on a straight line basis. In the
projections, amortization is based on the Company's amortization policies for
both existing rental tapes and those projected to be purchased.

The accumulated amortization related to rental tapes and games converted from
rental inventory to being presented for sale as previously viewed tapes or
determined to be lost or damaged are removed from accumulated amortization. The
relief from accumulated amortization is based on the operating projection cost
for these three categories of expense and the historical relationship of that
cost to the historical relief from accumulated amortization for them which is
19.96% of the three expenses combined.

REAL, SALES & PERSONAL PROPERTY TAXES:

Real property taxes for owned properties are prepaid to the government of
Puerto Rico semiannually for the following six month periods, 1/1-6/30 and
7/1-12/31. The related prepaid amounts included above as of 11/02/02 are $0.2
million. Additionally, some real property taxes (leased properties) are prepaid
to the landlord with the lease payments. The related balance of these
prepayments as of 11/02/02 was $0.1 million.

Approximately $3.2 million of the 11/02/02 balance is for personal property
taxes. Personal property taxes are prepaid annually to the government of Puerto
Rico in June of each year and cover the period from 7/1 through 6/30 of the
following year. The personal property tax rate for Puerto Rico is 6.33% and is
based on the net book value or 10% of the cost of all personal property owned
as of the end of the previous calendar year, whichever is higher.

Note that some real and personal property has not been assessed and thus we are
accruing for estimated payments based on the value of improvements / additions
made on these properties (discussed in the Accrued Expenses section of this
analysis). No real or personal property taxes are prepaid in the Virgin
Islands.

Sales tax is a volume of business tax that is prepaid annually to the
government of Puerto Rico around May of each year and covers the period from
7/1 through 6/30 of the following year. The volume of business tax rate varies
by municipality and is between 0.35% and 0.50%. The prepaid balance of $1.6 at
11/02/02 is based on the sales volume of each supermarket and video store in
Puerto Rico for the fiscal year that ended 01/27/01 due to the way the
Company's fiscal year ends and the government due dates for the related
reports. In the Virgin Islands, a gross receipts tax of 4.0% is paid
immediately after the end of each period and thus is accrued for on a periodic
basis (discussed in the Accrued Expenses section of this analysis).

Prepayments for projected periods is based on current tax rates, assets
employed at the tax measurement dates in the case of real and personal property
taxes, and a combination of actual and projected sales for the measurement
periods for the sales and gross receipts taxes. The decrease in the balances
for the projected periods are a result of the expected decrease in the Volume
of Business tax in May of 2002 and 2003 as a result of the decrease in sales
during the fiscal years ended January 27, 2001 and November 3, 2001.
Amortization is on a straight line basis for the period of prepayment.

RENT - The balance of prepaid rent as of 11/02/02 is a result of already making
the November 2002 lease payments. The projected balances are based on the same
practice and the related rental payments, per the leases, during the projected
periods.

INSURANCE - General Liability Insurance is prepaid in November of each year and
covers the period from 11/1 through 10/31 of the following year. As a result,
there was no balance as of 11/02/02. Property Insurance is prepaid in January
of each year and covers the period from 01/31 though 02/01 of the following
year. This insurance makes up the $1.3 million balance as of 11/02/02. Workers
Compensation Insurance is prepaid semiannually to both the Puerto Rico and
Virgin Islands governments for the following periods, 1/1-6/30 and 7/1-12/31.
This insurance made up $0.1 million of the balance as of 11/02/02. Projected
balances are based on the same insurance periods and increases anticipated in
the operating projection.

SUPPLIES consists of the operating supplies and maintenance parts inventory in
the warehouse that has not yet been shipped to the stores. Once shipped, they
are recorded as an expense to the store. Projected balances are held fairly
constant with the balance at the end of the Fiscal Year ended November 2, 2002.

ALL OTHERS consists primarily of un-amortized amounts under prepaid service
contracts that have a contract period different from the Company's fiscal year.
The projected periods have been held fairly constant with the balance at the
end of the fiscal year ended November 2, 2002 as it is not expected to vary
significantly.

BASIC ACCOUNTING POLICIES:
Property and equipment, including expenditures for remodeling and improvements,
are carried at cost. Routine maintenance, repairs and minor betterments are
charged to operations as incurred. Depreciation and amortization are computed
on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets or, in
relation to leasehold improvements and property under capital leases, over the
lesser of the asset's useful life or the lease term, not to exceed 20 years.
Estimated useful lives are 20 years for buildings and improvements, 5 to 12
years for furniture, fixtures and equipment, 4 years for automotive equipment
and 3 years for computer hardware and software.

Upon the sale, retirement or other disposition of assets, the related cost and
accumulated depreciation or amortization are eliminated from the accounts. Any
resulting gains or losses from disposals are included in the consolidated
statements of operations.

During the fiscal year ended January 27, 2001 the company inventoried its fixed
assets and removed all assets that it could not physically identify from its
accounts (both cost and accumulated depreciation). This resulted in $35.9
million, at cost, being removed from its accounts with a $3.5 charge to
depreciation and amortization.

TRADENAMES:
This value relates to the tradenames acquired at the time of the 1993
acquisition and they were valued by independent appraisers at that time.
Tradenames are being amortized over 40 years.

GOODWILL:
In July 1993, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of the common
stock of Pueblo International, Inc. and subsidiaries for an aggregate purchase
price of $283.6 million plus transaction costs. The shares were acquired from
an investor group including affiliates of Metropolitan Life Insurance Company,
The First Boston Corporation and certain current and former members of the
Company's management and its Board of Directors.

The acquisition of shares was accounted for as a purchase effective July 31,
1993. Accordingly, the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and
liabilities assumed. The excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair
market value of net assets acquired of approximately $210.2 million was
recognized as goodwill and is amortized over 40 years.

Since the acquisition goodwill has been reduced $18.2 million primarily to
adjust for the difference between the deferred tax liability recorded on the
books upon the initial acquisition at the statutory rate of 39% and the tax
benefit of asset dispositions since at lower tax rates.

It is projected that the adoption of FAS 142 will result in a write down of
Goodwill to $31.1. In this projection the write down is reflected as if it
occurred on the last day of the 40 week period ended November 3, 2001 and no
Goodwill amortization has been projected subsequent to that date. Goodwill, in
the future, will be reviewed for impairment on an annual basis.

FAVORABLE LEASES represents the difference between the rent required per the
leases and the higher value of rents in the market at the time of the
acquisition of the leases (mostly as part of the 1993 acquisition). This asset
is being amortized over varying periods, depending on the particular leases, on
a straight-line bases. Un-amortized balances are written off at the time the
decision is made to dispose of stores, such as was done at the end of the
second quarter of the fiscal year ended January 27, 2001 when the decision was
made to close the Company supermarkets in Cayey and Hato Tejas, Puerto Rico.
The write offs were approximately $2.7 million.

FRANCHISE FEES includes the unamortized portion of the franchise fees paid to
Blockbuster Inc. when each store was opened and the unamortized portion of a
step up in basis, set up at the time of the 1993 acquisition, for the value of
the Blockbuster Franchise Rights in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.

The Franchise fees paid totaled $1.3 million and were fully amortized over the
first five years of the 20 year life of the franchise agreement for each store.

The Franchise rights were valued at $7.5 million at the time of the acquisition
and are being amortized over 17 years.

BOND ISSUE COSTS are the un-amortized portion of the costs (fees, attorney
costs, etc.) incurred in connection with bonds issued at the time the Company
was acquired in 1993 and at the time of a refinancing in the Spring of 1997.
They are being amortized on a straight-line basis through May of 2003 when they
will be written off as a result of the refinancing. The balance of
approximately $0.2 million at that date will partially offset the projected
gain on the refinancing. The new bond refinancing is projected to cost $5.5
million and is written off as incurred and charged to Restructuring Costs in
the projections.

COMMITMENT FEES at 11/02/02 are the un-amortized portion of fees paid to banks
in connection with establishing the Company's $65.0 credit facility and the
amendment thereto effective August 11, 2000. During the fiscal year ending
November 2, 2002, the Company incurred additional fees of $0.5 million, which
are also being amortized on a straight-line basis through January 25, 2003. On
February 1, 2003, the above fees will be replaced with a new amount of $1.5
million (the projected cost of the new revolver and term loans). This new
amount is being amortized in the projections on a straight-line basis
throughout the term of the new revolving credit facility which is expected to
be 5 years.

UTILITY AND OTHER DEPOSITS are primarily deposits required by the Puerto Rico
and U.S. Virgin Islands power utilities. These have been held constant
throughout the Projections.

MORROW TRUST is the amount paid for an investment made in the Company's bonds
to provide funding for a former employee's severance benefits which is
discussed in the Other Liabilities and Deferred Credits section (Deferred
Compensation). For simplistic reasons, the projections anticipate a similar
type of investment will be made in May of 2003 when the bonds are refinanced.

INVESTMENT IN TOPCO is the required contribution to be a member of a buying
cooperative that the Company is a member of. The company purchases various
merchandise for resale, including Food Club label items for which it has an
exclusive on the island of Puerto Rico, and certain equipment through Topco. In
addition the Company receives annual dividends from the cooperative of $0.4 to
$0.5 million. The dividends are recorded as a reduction in cost of goods sold
in arriving at gross margin in the operating statement.

As of November 2, 2002, accounts payable were approximately 83% of inventory.
For all future years, accounts payable are being projected at approximately 80%
of inventory.

The 80% is the minimum level the Company projects it will need to maintain in
order to maintain its relationships with its vendors and in light of the
expected increased competitive situation in the Puerto Rico market.

</TABLE>

VACATION AND SICK LEAVE represents the Company's liabilities to its employees
for time off that they have accrued pursuant to the Company's vacation and sick
leave plans. Essentially the time off is accrued based on the employee's length
of service and employment anniversary date. With the exception of Puerto Rico
supermarket hourly employees vacation earned and not taken is forfeited. In the
case of Puerto Rico supermarket hourly employees unused vacation is carried
over. The policies as to accrual of paid sick leave and the disposition of sick
leave earned and not taken vary by employee group. For the most part employees
may accumulate, by carrying over from year-to-year unused sick leave days,
between 20 and 30 paid sick leave days. Excess sick leave days accumulated are
paid out. The accrued liability for the Plan periods is based on the actual
relationship of these expenses to salaries and the average monthly payments for
the two benefits. The liability is projected to increase in the projections
based on the employees' ability to carry these benefits over from year-to-year.

BONUSES represents the Company accrued expense pursuant to its store management
and administrative employee (Key Management Incentive Opportunity - KMIO) bonus
plans. The terms of both plans are determined each fiscal year and
qualification to receive a bonus is dependant on meeting certain sales and
earnings goals as defined in the plans. These plans are coordinated with
government mandated bonus plans which are based on the October to September
time frame and paid at Christmas time each year. The accrual for the Plan
periods is based on the company achieving its goals and employees earning their
targeted bonus under the Company's sponsored plans as well as the entire
government mandated bonus. Additionally, the newly signed Collective Bargaining
Agreement with the Company's hourly store employees calls for bonus payments in
November of 2002 and April of 2006. These are being accrued for accordingly.

GROUP MEDICAL AND DISABILITY is an accrual primarily for the Company's medical
benefits to its employees. Although the plans are administered by a third party
administrator in Puerto Rico, they are essentially self funded with stop loss
coverage for any claims over $50 thousand dollars. The accrued liability for
the projected periods is based on the actual relationship of these expenses to
salaries and the average monthly payments for the benefit.

SALARIES represents the accrual for salaries earned for the payroll week that
ended on the balance sheet date. All employees of the Company are paid on a
weekly basis. The accrual for the projected periods is expected to increase
over time as salaries increase with inflation.

VARIOUS WITHHOLDING & ACCRUED PAYROLL TAXES are self explanatory. The accrued
liability for the projected periods is based on the actual relationship of
these expenses to salaries and the average monthly payments for the
benefits/withholdings.

    SELF INSURANCE - GENERAL LIABILITY. See discussion in the Reserve For Self
    Insurance Claims section on page 49.

    ACCRUED RENT & TAXES - Accrued rent consists of Percentage rent, CAM, and
    the share of sub-rental income due to landlords. The value of these accrued
    rent items due as of 11/2/02 was $0.9 million. Accrued Gross Receipts Tax
    for the Virgin Islands and BB-Virgin Islands stores (4.0% of sales)
    accounts for approximately $0.1 million of the balance as of 11/2/02. These
    taxes are paid within 30 days of the end of the period. Also, accrued
    Property Taxes for certain real and personal property that have not yet
    been assessed account for approximately $1.6 million of the balance as of
    11/2/02. These are accruals for property where improvements / additions
    have been made but have not been assessed by the taxing authorities. These
    balances will be reduced as the taxing authorities assess and value these
    liabilities. The projections anticipate minimal decreases in these
    balances.

    ACCRUAL FOR UNVOUCHERED ITEMS - NON MERCHANDISE is the accrual done at the
    end of each accounting period for paperwork in process (not processed on
    the Company's system) for expense and fixed asset items. These balances are
    being held constant for the projected periods.

    INCOME TAXES PAYABLE at 11/2/02 was a debit balance representing the refund
    the Company was due when it filed its tax returns for the fiscal year ended
    November 3, 2001. For Plan purposes this refund is being collected during
    the 2(nd) Quarter of the fiscal year ending November 1, 2003.


                                                                            40

ACCRUED PENSION AND SERP (Supplemental Employee Retirement Plan) are the
amounts due to be paid to the Company's qualified defined benefit plan which
covers approximately 2,700 eligible current and former employees and 28 current
and former employees who are participants in the SERP, a non qualified plan.
Full and part time hourly and salaried employees who are age 21, with 1,000
hours of service in a year are eligible to participate in the defined benefit
pension plan. Participants in the SERP plan must have 5 years of service and
are determined by the Board of Directors.

The accruals are based on the normal relationship of the expenses for these
benefits to salaries/wages and the normal timing of the required payments to
the plans.

LITIGATION RESERVE is an accrued liability for various litigation in progress
involving both former vendor contracts and former employees. The reserve is
periodically evaluated by the Company's in-house counsel in conjunction with
any outside counsel involved in a particular matter and is considered adequate.
The accrual is held constant throughout the projections.

DEFERRED INCOME - VENDOR ALLOWANCES represents monies received from vendors to
participate in various programs which are based on the terms under which the
money is paid and is not recognizable as income. The allowances are amortized
to income as they are earned. Accrual of additional allowances are included in
the projections based on existing arrangements with vendors. Amortization of
the allowances are based on projected sales volume for the anticipated period
of the arrangements.

ACCRUED UTILITY COSTS represents accrual for utility services provided for
which no billing has been received. The Plan does not include any activities
that would cause a significant change in the accrual. It has been held constant
throughout the projections.

SHORT TERM DEFERRED TAX LIABILITY - see the Deferred Income Taxes section.

RESERVE FOR REJECTED CASH DISCOUNTS represents an accrual for cash discounts
taken when vendor invoices were paid that may be rejected by the vendor. The
Company takes all cash discounts whether invoices are paid within terms or not.
Historically, approximately 78% of such discounts are not eventually repaid.
The balance in this reserve is analyzed at least quarterly and adjusted based
on a review of the potential liability for the specific discounts accrued. Any
resulting adjustment is to cost of goods sold. The accrual has been held
constant in the Plan as the Company continues the practice of taking all cash
discounts regardless of whether payments are made within terms.

PROFIT SHARING ACCRUAL is the accrued liability for the Company's contribution
to the plan which is made in the Spring following the end of the plan year. The
accrual is based on 3% of the wages for the plan participants. Eligibility is
for salaried employees who are at least 21 years of age with 1,000 hours of
service in a year. Vesting accrues at the rate of 25% per year starting in the
first year. The accrual at the end of the Plan periods are based on the normal
percentage of wages and the normal portion of total employees being eligible
for participating in the contribution.

ALL OTHER - UNDER $0.5 MILLION includes accrual for specific liabilities due
money order vendors and for audit, bank and royalty fees, etc.

The Company is expecting to take out term loans from the banks when the
refinancing is completed on May 17, 2003. These term loans will be secured by
the two properties the Company owns in Puerto Rico that have an appraised value
of approximately $48.0 million, the value of properties where the Company
leases the land but owns the building, and the value of the equipment at the
Company's new Isla Verde store where the Company also leases the land and owns
the building. The tenant for the owned properties is the Company. Its
distribution facility, a supermarket and a Blockbuster store are located on one
parcel and a supermarket and a Blockbuster are located on the other parcel.
There are also tenants of small facilities on both parcels.

A $35 million term loan will be over 15 years and will include equal principal
payments every month for 180 months. Interest will be paid on the beginning
principal balance each month. The terms proposed for interest are an annual
rate of LIBOR plus 350 basis points with a floor rate of 7.0%.

Two smaller term loans for $5.0 and $3.5 million will be over 5 years and will
include equal principal payments every month for 60 months. Interest will be
paid on the beginning principal balance each month. The terms proposed for
interest are an annual rate of LIBOR plus 400 basis points with a floor rate of
7.0%.

The interest in the Operating Projection for both term loans has been projected
at 7.0% for the initial 12 months and 8.0% for all future years.

Deferred taxes are a result of recognizing certain items of income or expense
at different times for financial reporting and income tax return reporting
purposes.

Deferred tax assets are primarily the result of timing differences related to
certain employee benefit plan expenses, self insurance claim expenses and
various other expenses that are accrued but unpaid at the balance sheet date.
Income tax reporting allows deductions for these expenses only at such time as
they are paid.

Deferred tax liabilities are a result of:

    Depreciation and amortization policies for income tax reporting purposes
    that result in writing off fixed assets and trade names at a greater
    amounts than that used for financial reporting purposes in the earlier
    years of their economic life and a lower rate in their later years.

    Differing accounting policies for inventory for tax purposes than that used
    for financial reporting purposes. This relates to certain operating costs
    that tax rules require be capitalized as part of the value of inventory but
    GAAP requires be expensed.

    Leases accounted for as capital leases for financial reporting purposes but
    as operating leases for tax reporting purposes.

The change in the Long-term deferred tax asset balance in the projected periods
is a result of income tax benefits projected in all future years.

The Company is self insured (a retention) for the first $250 thousand (a
combination of expenses and amounts due under the claim) of each general
liability claim. Expenses and losses in excess of this amount are insured 100%.

Claims are processed, investigated and managed by the Company's Risk Management
staff in consultation with the insurance carriers and the attorney, should one
be involved in a particular claim. The claims are evaluated and valued by an
actuary each year and the related liability established on that basis. The most
recent actuary evaluation was done as of August 31, 2002.

From January of 1997 through November of 2002 the total liability for such
claims decreased approximately $7.7 million dollars primarily as a result of
the following factors:

         The number of claims initiated each year had declined 50% from the
         fiscal 1997 level. This reduction is a result of a change in the
         Company's methods to reduce the circumstances that would cause a claim
         to be initiated.

         Achieving better control over the circumstances of a claim and its
         management immediately upon its occurrence.

         Changing claims administration from a third party administrator (TPA)
         to an in-house staff beginning with the 1999 fiscal year.

The balances have been projected on the basis of the related expense included
in the Operating Projection and a normal level of cash outlays based on the 52
weeks ended November 2, 2002. The total liability is projected to gradually
decline as the number of claims continue to decline.

DEFERRED PENSION PLAN CONTRIBUTION AND SUPPLEMENTAL EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT PLAN
(SERP) - This is the long term liability of the plans discussed in the Accrued
Expenses section. The projected increases in the liability are based on the
total expense, per the Operating Projections, versus the required cash
contributions included in the projection for accrued expenses.

DEFERRED SUPPLEMENTAL PENSION is a reserve for 3 separate non-qualified plans
that cover 3 former employees of the Company. They were provided to these
individuals, upon retirement, who were not participants in the SERP. The plans
are essentially defined benefit plans with the beneficiary receiving benefits
until death. After their death, surviving spouses receive 50% of the
beneficiary's defined benefit amount. These plans are reviewed by an actuary on
an annual basis. The projected increases in the liability are based on the
total expense, per the Operating Projections, versus the required cash
contributions included in the projection for accrued expenses.

DEFERRED COMPENSATION is the present value of an actuarially determined
liability to a former officer for severance pursuant to the terms of his
employment contract. Under the terms of the agreement the former officer
receives a monthly benefit for life equal to one half of his base salary at the
time of retirement and is reduced by the monthly benefits paid to him from the
Company's defined benefit pension plan and the SERP. The payments are funded
from the earnings of the Morrow Trust included in Other Assets.

DEFERRED GAIN ON SALE/LEASEBACK represents the portion of the gain realized at
the time the Company sold and leased back 7 properties in June of 1999 that
must be deferred and amortized over the initial 20 year term of the related
leases pursuant to generally accepted accounting principals (GAAP). The
deferred gain is associated with 4 of the 7 leases and is being amortized on a
straight-line basis for the two leases that are operating leases and using the
interest method for the 2 leases that are capitalized leases.

DEFERRED ESCALATION IN LEASES represents the liability the Company is required
to recognize as a result of certain of its operating leases having required
rent increases during their fixed term. In such cases GAAP requires that the
Company recognize a rent expense in each period that is the proportionate
share, for the period, of the total rent to be paid over the fixed term.
Consequently, the rent recognized is a level (straight - line) amount
regardless of the cash being paid. This liability is the difference between the
cash paid and the level amount of rent expense recorded on the books. The
liability "builds" in the early years of the fixed term portion of the lease
and "turns around" (decreases) in the later years of the fixed term. Projected
balances are based on the specific leases involved and the related lease
expense included in the Operating Projection versus the cash payments required
under the terms of the leases.

PROPERTY INSURANCE DEDUCTIBLE represents the unused portion of the Company's
$1.5 million deductible per occurrence. The balance represents the difference
between the accrual and minor claims that have been charged against it. For
projected periods the increase in the liability is based on the related expense
included in the Operating Projection.

DEPOSITS DUE TENANTS represents the amounts received from tenants/subtenants at
the Company's retail locations for security deposits, last month rent, etc.

DEFERRED GAIN ON BUSINESS INTERRUPTION PORTION OF THE HURRICANE GEORGES CLAIM
as of November 2, 2002 represents the difference between any advances the
Company had received and any unreimbursed claim preparation expenses related to
the Company's claim. In July of 2002, the Company settled the claim and
recorded a gain of $14.7 million as a result of this claim.

Note 1: The actual loss for this period was $8.2 million. The $119.1 million
        difference between actual and the $127.3 above is a result of adjusting
        goodwill to $31.1 million as of November 3, 2001

Note 2: The actual results for this period was a loss of $0.1 million. The
        $4.7 difference is a result of these projections excluding any
        amortization of goodwill.
