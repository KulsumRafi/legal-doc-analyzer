            Base Rent shall be payable in advance of the first day of each Month
            during the Lease Term; provided, however, if the Lease Term
            commences on a day other than the first day of a Month, Tenant shall
            pay to Landlord concurrently with the commencement of the Lease
            Term, the Base Rent for such partial Month on a pro-rated basis
            calculated using a thirty (30) day month. The Base Rent and all
            other sums payable to Landlord hereunder shall be paid by good check
            payable in currency of the United States of America as at the time
            shall be legal tender for the payment of public and private debts,
            at the Landlord's address specified for notices in Section 30, or at
            such other place as Landlord may designate in writing from time to
            time. Such payments shall be made without any abatement, deduction
            or offset whatsoever, and without any prior demand therefor. In the
            event that the Lease Term is terminated for any reason on a date
            other than the last day of a calendar month, on the first day of the
            last calendar month of the Lease Term Tenant shall pay to Landlord
            as Base Rent for the period from said first day of said last
            calendar month to and including the last day of the Lease Term that
            proportion of the monthly Base Rent hereunder which the number of
            days between said first day of said last calendar month and the last
            day of the term hereof bears to thirty (30). If a check of Tenant's
            is dishonored for insufficient funds, Landlord may require Tenant to
            make future payments due hereunder via electronic transfer or
            cashier's check.

      5.    ADDITIONAL CHARGES. Tenant also shall pay from time to time during
            the Lease Term as additional charges ("ADDITIONAL CHARGES"):

            a.    all amounts and obligations other than Base Rent which Tenant
                  herein assumes or agrees to pay, including without limitation
                  all Impositions; and

            b.    interest at the Default Rate on such of the foregoing amounts
                  and obligations other than Base Rent as are payable to
                  Landlord which are not paid on or before the fifth (5th) day
                  after written notice by Landlord to Tenant that such amount is
                  due, with such interest to accrue from each date that such
                  amount was due until paid.

      6.    LATE CHARGES AND INTEREST. Tenant acknowledges that late payment by
            Tenant to Landlord of Rent under this Lease will cause Landlord to
            incur costs not contemplated by this Lease, the exact amount of
            which is extremely difficult or impracticable to determine. Such
            costs include, but are not limited to, processing and accounting
            charges, late charges that may be imposed on Landlord by the terms
            of any mortgage or deed of trust secured by the Leased Premises.
            Therefore, if any installment of Base Rent or any payment of
            Additional Charges, Impositions or other rent due from Tenant is not
            received by Landlord in good funds by the applicable due date,
            Tenant shall pay to Landlord an additional sum equal to five percent
            (5%) of the amount overdue as a late charge. The parties acknowledge
            that this late charge represents a fair and reasonable estimate of
            the costs that Landlord will incur by reason of late payment by
            Tenant. In no event shall this provision for a late charge be deemed
            to grant to Tenant a grace period or extension of time within which
            to pay any Rent or prevent Landlord from exercising any right or
            remedy available to Landlord upon Tenant's failure to pay any Rent
            due under this Lease in a timely fashion, including any right to
            terminate this Lease as set forth elsewhere herein. If any Base Rent
            remains delinquent for a period in excess of five (5) days then, in
            addition to such late charge, Tenant shall pay to Landlord interest
            on any Base Rent, Rent and/or Additional Charges that is not paid
            when due at the Default Rate following the date such amount became
            due until paid.

      7.    USE OF LEASED PREMISES. Tenant may use the Leased Premises for any
            lawful purpose permitted by applicable zoning, building and other
            Legal Requirements of municipal, state or

                                  Page 5 of 42
<PAGE>
            federal authorities now in force, or which hereafter may be in force
            with respect to the Leased Premises. Tenant will not commit, omit or
            permit any act, condition or event which is contrary to any Legal
            Requirement or Insurance Requirement. Tenant shall not commit any
            waste in or about the Leased Premises, and Tenant shall keep the
            Leased Premises in a neat, clean, attractive and orderly condition,
            free of any nuisances.

      8.    TRIPLE NET LEASE. This Lease shall be deemed an absolute triple net
            lease and Tenant shall do all acts and make all payments connected
            with or arising out of any use or occupation of the Leased Premises,
            or any part thereof, whether now or hereafter existing, levied or
            imposed, and whether foreseen or unforeseen. Landlord shall not be
            obligated to perform any acts or be subject to any liabilities or to
            make any payments except as otherwise specifically and expressly
            provided in this Lease.

      9.    MAINTENANCE AND REPAIRS.

            a.    Tenant at its sole Cost and Expense will keep in good, clean,
                  first class and operable condition the Leased Premises and
                  every part thereof, including, but not limited to, all
                  plumbing, heating, roof, parking lot, ventilation, air
                  conditioning and electrical systems and equipment in, on or
                  serving the Leased Premises, windows, doors, floors, interior
                  walls, the roof, exterior walls, ceiling and basement which
                  are part of the Leased Premises, and will make or cause to be
                  made all necessary or appropriate repairs, replacements or
                  renewals thereof, whether interior or exterior, structural or
                  non-structural, ordinary or extraordinary, foreseen or
                  unforeseen, capital or ordinary.

            b.    In addition to the foregoing, Tenant shall be required to make
                  such repairs, maintenance and replacements at such reasonable
                  intervals as the parties may agree, which intervals are
                  initially designated on Exhibit D. Tenant will maintain a
                  software package that schedules all preventative maintenance
                  procedures with the settings consistent with those set forth
                  on Exhibit D. Such repairs, maintenance and replacements shall
                  be done in a good, workmanlike and first class manner. If
                  Landlord so requires, Tenant shall obtain Landlord's consent,
                  which shall not be unreasonably withheld, as to the selection
                  of contractors prior to commencement of such work. Subject to
                  Tenant's right to use internal personnel for repair,
                  replacement and maintenance obligations, Tenant shall contract
                  for regular maintenance and upkeep for landscaping, elevators,
                  janitorial and the HVAC system, and shall provide Landlord
                  with copies of such concurrently herewith and within five (5)
                  business days after Landlord's request. If Landlord and/or a
                  successor in interest to Tenant shall be bound by such
                  contracts, such contracts shall include a clause that makes
                  them terminable upon thirty (30) days written notice from
                  Landlord. Unless Tenant has contracted for repair, replacement
                  and maintenance obligations with a third-party, at all times
                  during the Lease Term, Tenant shall maintain internal
                  maintenance personnel adequate to maintain the Leased Premises
                  in good, clean, first class and operable condition. If Tenant
                  does not maintain such internal maintenance personnel, as
                  Landlord shall reasonably determine, Tenant shall enter into
                  such maintenance contracts on such terms and conditions as
                  Landlord shall reasonably require.

            c.    Tenant shall also cause the Leased Premises to be inspected by
                  a licensed contractor on an annual basis, or at such other
                  times as Landlord shall reasonably designate, and Tenant shall
                  perform, subject to Unavoidable Delays, within forty five (45)
                  days after the presentation of the contractor's findings, all
                  repairs, maintenance and replacements designated by said
                  contractor. If Landlord so requires, Tenant shall obtain
                  Landlord's consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
                  as to the selection of said contractor.

                                  Page 6 of 42
<PAGE>
                  Tenant shall also cause the roof, parking lot, plumbing and
                  electrical systems to be inspected by a licensed roofing
                  contractor, paving company, plumbing company or electrical
                  company as applicable, on an annual basis, or at such other
                  times as Landlord shall designate and Tenant shall perform,
                  subject to Unavoidable Delays, within forty five (45) days
                  after the presentation of the contractor's findings, all
                  repairs, maintenance and replacements designated by said
                  contractor. Tenant shall provide Landlord with a copy of any
                  reports or findings pursuant to any inspection required
                  hereunder within five (5) business days after Tenant's receipt
                  thereof.

            d.    If Tenant does not timely perform all of its maintenance,
                  repair and replacement obligations as required by the terms of
                  this Lease, Landlord may, but shall have no obligation to,
                  perform such obligations at Tenant's sole Cost and Expense. In
                  such event, Tenant shall reimburse Landlord for all Costs and
                  Expenses associated therewith upon demand, with interest at
                  the Default Rate from date of payment by Landlord. Such sums
                  shall be considered Rent for all purposes hereunder.

            e.    Tenant shall be required to maintain the Leased Premises in a
                  first class condition through the Lease Term, at its sole Cost
                  and Expense. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the
                  contrary, Tenant shall be solely responsible for all
                  maintenance, repairs and replacements affecting the Leased
                  Premises during the Lease Term and in no event shall Tenant be
                  deemed an agent of Landlord for the purpose of conducting such
                  maintenance, repairs, and replacements without the express
                  written acknowledgement of agency by Landlord.

      10.   TENANT'S EQUIPMENT. All of Tenant's Equipment shall remain the
            property of Tenant, provided that:

            a.    Tenant shall have the right at any time during the Lease Term
                  while not in Default to remove from the Leased Premises all or
                  any part of Tenant's Equipment in or on the Leased Premises
                  without regard to the manner placed on or affixed to the
                  Leased Premises, provided that Tenant at its expense
                  immediately will repair or be obligated for all Costs and
                  Expenses in connection with all damage to the Leased Premises
                  caused by the removal of Tenant's Equipment therefrom.

            b.    Any of Tenant's Equipment not removed by Tenant at its expense
                  within thirty (30) days after the expiration or earlier
                  termination of this Lease or the Lease Term shall be
                  considered abandoned by Tenant and may be appropriated, sold,
                  destroyed, or otherwise disposed of by Landlord without any
                  further notice to Tenant, and without obligation to account
                  therefor. Tenant at its expense will immediately repair or be
                  obligated for all Costs and Expenses in connection with all
                  damage to the Leased Premises caused by any removal of
                  Tenant's Equipment therefrom. Landlord shall not be
                  responsible for any loss of or damage to Tenant's Equipment,
                  except to the extent caused by Landlord's gross negligence or
                  willful acts.

      11.   ALTERATIONS AND ADDITIONS. Tenant shall have the right at any time
            during the Lease Term, at Tenant's sole Cost and Expense, while not
            in Default to make changes, alterations, additions or improvements
            (collectively, "ALTERATIONS", or singularly, an "ALTERATION") in or
            to the Leased Premises, subject to the following:

            a.    Tenant shall not construct any Alterations or otherwise alter
                  the Leased Premises without Landlord's prior written approval,
                  which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or

                                  Page 7 of 42
<PAGE>
                  delayed, except that provided Tenant complies with each and
                  every other term and condition applicable to Alterations, no
                  approval by Landlord shall be required provided:

                          i.  The cost of the Alteration in question does not
                              cost in excess of Fifty Thousand Dollars
                              ($50,000.00);

                         ii.  The total cost of all Alterations for the Lease
                              Year in which Tenant commences construction of the
                              Alteration in question does not total more than
                              One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000.00);
                              provided, however, that the cost of Alterations
                              costing less than Fifty Thousand Dollars
                              ($50,000.00) shall not apply to the total
                              Alteration amount of One Hundred Thousand Dollars
                              ($100,000.00) for the applicable Lease Year unless
                              and until the total cost of all Alterations for
                              such Lease Year costing less than Fifty Thousand
                              Dollars ($50,000.00) each shall total at least One
                              Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000.00), and then,
                              all of such Alterations shall apply to the total
                              Alteration amount for said Lease Year and the
                              Tenant shall be required to obtain Landlord's
                              consent for any and all subsequent Alterations
                              during said Lease Year;

                        iii.  Such Alteration does not affect the structural
                              integrity of the Leased Premises or any
                              base-building system; and

                         iv.  Such Alteration does not adversely affect the
                              future leaseability of the Leased Premises to a
                              subsequent lessee.

                  Except for any Alterations permitted under this Section 1l(a)
                  without Landlord's consent, Tenant shall not construct any
                  Alteration until Landlord has approved in writing the plans
                  and specifications therefor, and such Alteration shall be
                  constructed substantially in compliance with such approved
                  plans and specifications by a licensed contractor first
                  approved by Landlord (who shall not unreasonably withhold,
                  condition or delay its approval of any such contractor). All
                  Alterations constructed by Tenant shall be constructed by a
                  reputable licensed contractor in a good and workmanlike first
                  class manner and using new materials of good quality, in
                  accordance with all applicable laws and regulations.

            b.    Tenant shall not commence construction of any Alterations
                  until:

                          i.  All required governmental approvals and permits
                              have been obtained;

                         ii.  All requirements regarding insurance imposed by
                              this Lease have been satisfied;

                        iii.  Tenant has given Landlord at least ten (10) day's
                              prior written notice of its intention to commence
                              such construction,

                         iv.  For any Alteration requiring Landlord's consent
                              hereunder, Tenant has obtained contingent
                              liability and broad form builders' risk insurance
                              in an amount equal to the cost of the Alteration
                              if there are any perils relating to the proposed
                              construction not covered by insurance required to
                              be carried pursuant to Section 19.

                          v.  For any Alteration requiring Landlord's consent
                              hereunder, Tenant has deposited into an escrow
                              account an amount equal to not less than one
                              hundred fifty

                              percent (150%) of the amount of the estimated hard
                              and soft costs of the Alteration, securing
                              Tenant's payment and performance of its
                              obligations related to the applicable Alteration.

            c.    All Alterations shall remain the property of Tenant during the
                  Lease Term but shall not be altered or removed from the Leased
                  Premises except in further accordance with this Section 11;
                  provided, however, that any Alteration which involves Tenant's
                  Equipment may be altered and removed in accordance with
                  Section 10. At the expiration or sooner termination of the
                  Lease Term, all Alterations shall be surrendered to Landlord
                  as part of the realty and shall then become Landlord's
                  property, and Landlord shall have no obligation to reimburse
                  Tenant for all or any portion of the value or cost thereof,
                  provided, however, Landlord expressly reserves the right to
                  require Tenant to remove any Alterations prior to the
                  expiration or sooner termination of the Lease Term by
                  providing Tenant with written notice thereof within sixty (60)
                  days prior to the expiration of the Lease Term or within
                  thirty (30) days after the earlier termination of the Lease
                  Term, as applicable.

            d.    For any Alteration reasonably determined by Landlord to
                  adversely affect the future leaseability of the Leased
                  Premises, Tenant shall post a letter of credit, in form and
                  content and with a bank reasonably acceptable to Landlord (or
                  other security reasonably satisfactory to Landlord) in an
                  amount equal to one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the
                  estimated cost (as determined by a licensed contractor's bid
                  good for reasonable period of time) to remove such Alteration
                  and restore the Leased Premises to its state immediately prior
                  to the commencement of construction of said Alteration. In
                  addition to the foregoing, Tenant shall cause a licensed
                  contractor reasonably acceptable to Landlord (if Landlord so
                  desires to maintain acceptance of such contractor) to prepare
                  a bid for the removal of said Alteration and restoration of
                  the Leased Premises to its state immediately prior to the
                  commencement of construction of said Alteration on each fifth
                  anniversary of the completion of construction of said
                  Alteration and shall increase the amount of the letter of
                  credit or other security, as applicable, to the extent
                  necessary to provide Landlord with one hundred fifty percent
                  (150%) security for such removal and restoration. Such letter
                  of credit or security may be drawn upon only upon Tenant's
                  failure to act in accordance with Landlord's request under
                  Section 31. The foregoing notwithstanding, Tenant shall not be
                  required to comply with the requirements of this Section 1l(d)
                  if it obtains a minimum credit rating of at least BBB-
                  (minimum investment grade rating).

            e.    Every six (6) months Tenant shall notify Landlord in writing
                  of the nature and cost of any and all Alterations performed by
                  Tenant hereunder, and, to the extent Landlord has not already
                  been provided with plans, specifications, approvals, permits,
                  the final cost and such other information as Landlord shall
                  reasonably determine related to said Alteration, Tenant shall
                  provide Landlord with such information concurrently therewith.

            f.    Tenant shall, at its sole Cost and Expense, make any
                  Alteration of any sort to the Leased Premises when and if
                  required by applicable current or future law, including, but
                  not limited to, the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990
                  and all applicable fire and safety codes. Tenant-shall not be
                  required to make such Alterations solely as a result of a
                  change in the law as to such requirements, but only at such
                  times as are required by the applicable law or code. Tenant
                  may take advantage of any phase in or "grandfathering"
                  provisions in such laws and codes. Any such Alterations shall
                  be made by Tenant in accordance with and subject to the
                  provisions of this Section 11.

                                  Page 9 of 42
<PAGE>
            g.    In performing Alterations, Tenant shall not be deemed the
                  agent of Landlord for any purpose without the express written
                  acknowledgement of such agency by Landlord.

            h.    The provisions and conditions of Sections 13 and 14 below
                  shall apply to any work performed by Tenant under this Section
                  11.

      12.   IMPOSITIONS. Subject to Section 15 relating to permitted contests,
            Tenant during the Lease Term (i) will pay when due (or such earlier
            date as may be required by the installment payment provisions below
            in this Section 12) and prior to delinquency all Real Property Taxes
            levied or assessed against the Leased Premises; and (ii) will pay
            all other Impositions; both subsections (i) and (ii), before any
            interest, penalty, fine or cost may be added for non-payment, and
            will furnish to Landlord for inspection within thirty (30) days
            after such payment, receipts of the appropriate taxing authority or
            other proof satisfactory to Landlord evidencing payment of such
            other Impositions. Tenant will protect, indemnify and hold Landlord
            harmless from and against all liabilities, obligations, claims,
            damages, penalties, causes of action and Costs and Expenses imposed
            upon or incurred by or asserted against Landlord or the Leased
            Premises by reason of Tenant's failure to pay all Impositions as
            required herein. If Real Property Taxes or any other Impositions are
            payable in installments, Tenant may, at its election, make payment
            thereof in installments which are due and payable during the Lease
            Term; provided, however, Tenant shall pay Real Property Taxes in
            quarterly installments during each tax year; provided further,
            however, that Tenant shall not be required to make such quarterly
            payments of Real Property Taxes if it obtains a minimum credit
            rating of at least BBB- (minimum investment grade rating). To the
            extent Tenant is required to make quarterly payments of Real
            Property Taxes pursuant to the preceding sentence, Tenant shall make
            such payments directly to the relevant governmental authority if
            permitted by such authority; provided, however, that if the relevant
            taxing authority does not accept quarterly payments, Tenant shall
            make such payments into an interest bearing escrow account, with the
            escrow agent being directed to make such payments to the relevant
            taxing authority when directed by either Tenant or Landlord. Any
            Impositions relating to a fiscal period, part of which is within and
            part of which is subsequent to the Lease Term, whether or not such
            Impositions shall become due and payable or a lien upon the Leased
            Premises or any part thereof, or be assessed, levied, confirmed or
            imposed during the Lease Term, shall be adjusted and apportioned
            between Tenant and Landlord so that Tenant shall pay only that
            portion of such Impositions computed by multiplying the total amount
            of such Impositions relating to the fiscal period by a fraction, the
            numerator of which is the number of days constituting the remainder
            of the Lease Term and the denominator of which is the number of days
            constituting the entire fiscal period. The amount due from either
            party to the other based upon the adjustment and apportionment of
            such Impositions shall be paid at or promptly following expiration
            or termination of the Lease Term.

      13.   COMPLIANCE WITH REQUIREMENTS. Subject to Section 15 relating to
            permitted contests, Tenant during the Lease Term will:

            a.    comply with all Legal Requirements and Insurance Requirements;
                  and

            b.    procure, maintain and comply with all permits, licenses,
                  franchises and other authorizations required for the use of
                  the Leased Premises or any part thereof then being made by
                  Tenant, and for the proper erection, installation, operation
                  and maintenance of the Improvements and Tenant's Equipment or
                  any part thereof.

                                  Page 10 of 42
<PAGE>
      14.   LIENS. If the Leased Premises, or any part thereof shall at any time
            become subject to any vendor's, mechanic's, laborer's or
            materialmen's lien based upon Tenant's Work, any Alteration or the
            furnishing of material, labor or professional services to Tenant or
            the Leased Premises and contracted for by or on behalf of Tenant or
            its contractors or subcontractors, Tenant shall cause the same, at
            Tenant's expense, to be discharged or bonded over (pursuant to
            applicable state law) within twenty (20) days after notice thereof,
            and Tenant shall defend, indemnify, protect and hold Landlord
            harmless from all liability, loss, Costs and Expenses arising from
            such lien, Alteration, material, labor and/or professional services.

      15.   PERMITTED CONTESTS. Tenant at its expense, after prior written
            notice to Landlord and while not in Default, may contest in its own
            name or in the name of Landlord, or both, by appropriate action
            taken in good faith and with due diligence, the amount or validity
            or application, in whole or in part, of any Impositions or any Legal
            Requirement, provided that:

            a.    in the case of any Impositions or Legal Requirement, Tenant
                  shall first make all contested payments, under protest if it
                  desires, unless Tenant's action in some manner suspends the
                  collection of such payments or unless Tenant is not required
                  to make such payments;

            b.    neither the Leased Premises nor any part thereof or interest
                  therein could realistically under the then existing
                  circumstances be deemed to be in danger of being sold,
                  forfeited or lost by reason of the contest;

            c.    in the case of any Impositions or Legal Requirement, Tenant
                  shall have furnished such security, if any, as may be required
                  by governmental authority and reasonably approved by Landlord;

            d.    in the case of any Legal Requirement, Landlord could not
                  realistically and under the then existing circumstances be in
                  danger of any criminal or civil liability for failure to
                  comply therewith; and

            e.    in the case of any Imposition or Legal Requirement which
                  remains unpaid at any time during such contest, Tenant shall
                  have furnished to Landlord such security as Landlord shall
                  reasonably require in an amount not less than one hundred
                  twenty five percent (125%) of the amount claimed to be owed by
                  a governmental authority.

      16.   NO CLAIMS AGAINST LANDLORD. Nothing contained in this Lease shall
            constitute any consent (except where consent is expressly required
            and given under this Lease) or request by Landlord, express or
            implied, for the performance of any labor or services or the
            furnishing of any materials or other property in respect of the
            Leased Premises or any part thereof, or as giving Tenant any right,
            power or authority to contract for or permit the performance of any
            labor or services or the furnishing of any materials or other
            property in such fashion as would permit the making of any claim
            against Landlord, except as any such claim is expressly provided for
            by statute despite the provisions of this Section. Any labor,
            services or material furnished to the Leased Premises in connection
            with the fulfillment of Tenant's obligations hereunder shall be the
            sole responsibility of Tenant.

      17.   INDEMNIFICATION BY TENANT. Tenant will indemnify, defend, protect
            and hold Landlord harmless from and against all liabilities,
            obligations, claims, damages, penalties, causes of action, and
            proceedings, and all Costs and Expenses incurred in connection
            therewith, imposed upon or incurred by or asserted against Landlord
            or the Leased Premises by reason of the occurrence or existence of
            any matter or thing relating to this Lease or the

                                  Page 11 of 42
<PAGE>
            Leased Premises during the Lease Term, unless resulting from the
            negligence or willful acts of Landlord, including but not limited
            to:

            a.    any accident, injury to or death of persons (including
                  workers) or loss of or damage to property occurring on or
                  about the Leased Premises or any part thereof;

            b.    any condition or use of the Leased Premises or any part
                  thereof;

            c.    any failure on the part of Tenant to perform or comply with
                  any of the terms of this Lease;

            d.    performance of any labor or services or the furnishing of any
                  materials or other property in respect of the Leased Premises
                  or any part thereof; and

            e.    all claims for loss or damage to the Leased Premises
                  uncompensated by Tenant's insurance.

      18.   UTILITIES. In addition to the Rent and other payments herein
            provided, Tenant during the Lease Term shall pay prior to
            delinquency for all water, gas, light, power, telephone, sewage,
            refrigeration, air conditioning, heat and ventilating, janitorial,
            and all other materials and utilities used in connection with or
            supplied to the Leased Premises. To the extent not already
            installed, Tenant at its Cost and Expense shall have separate meters
            installed for power, gas, water and other utilities for which
            separate meters are available, and Tenant solely shall be obligated
            for all utility connect, disconnect and security deposit charges
            applicable to the Leased Premises. Landlord shall not be liable for,
            and Tenant shall not be entitled to any other relief, by reason of
            the unavailability or limited availability of the foregoing
            utilities and services.

      19.   INSURANCE.

            a.    Risks To Be Insured. Tenant at its Cost and Expense during the

                             representatives of Tenant, which, in the absence of
                             this Section 19(d)(i), would arise in favor of any
                             insurance company insuring Landlord against loss by
                             fire or casualty and loss of any other type

                             Landlord's insurer, if any, Landlord hereby
                             releases and waives its right of recovery against
                             Tenant for loss or damage resulting from damage to

                             in this Lease, to the extent mat Landlord is

                              this release and waiver shall not constitute a
                              release and waiver by Landlord of any right of
                              recovery against Tenant for loss or damage,
                              whether arising in connection with the same claim
                              or separate claims, in excess of insurance
                              proceeds actually received by Landlord.

                         ii. To the extent permitted by Tenant's insurer, if
                             any, Tenant hereby releases and waives any and all
                             rights of subrogation against Landlord, and against
                             the officers, employees, agents and representatives
                             of Landlord, which, in the absence of this Section
                             19(d), would arise in favor of any insurance
                             company insuring Tenant against loss by fire or
                             casualty and loss of any other type resulting from

                             portion thereof, or in damage to or destruction of
                             the Leased Premises of Tenant or the property of

                             Premises, and, to the extent permitted by Tenant's
                             insurer, if any, Tenant hereby releases and waives
                             its right of recovery against Landlord for loss or
                             damage resulting from damage to or destruction of

                             the extent that Tenant is compensated for such loss
                             or damage by actual receipt of proceeds from
                             insurance policies covering such loss or damage or
                             portions thereof, it being expressly understood and
                             agreed that this release and waiver shall not
                             constitute a release and waiver by Tenant of any
                             right of recovery against Landlord for loss or
                             damage, whether arising in connection with the same
                             claim or separate claims, in excess of insurance

                             rights and releases and waivers of the rights of
                             the Landlord and of the Tenant respectively are
                             expressly conditioned upon the Landlord and the
                             Tenant each being able to obtain in present and
                             future policies required under this Lease of fire,

                             subrogation against third parties responsible for
                             loss, and in the event either the Landlord or the
                             Tenant at any time is unable to obtain policies
                             containing such subrogation waiver clauses or
                             endorsements at a commercially reasonable cost,

                             shall be considered withdrawn and shall in no wise
                             be effective as to loss or damage arising from
                             risks covered by such policies.

                         iv. Notwithstanding anything contained in Sections
                             19(d)(i)-(iii), the insurance required to be

                  Costs and Expenses incurred by the Landlord and Tenant in the
                  collection thereof, including, without limitation, adjusters
                  fees and expenses) shall be paid only for the Restoration,
                  subject to Sections 20(d) and (e) below.

            d.    Abatement. During any period when Tenant's use of the Leased
                  Premises is prevented in whole or part by reason of total or
                  partial damage to or destruction of the Improvements, or by
                  reason of such restoration, the Rent shall be temporarily
                  abated in proportion to the degree that Tenant's use of the
                  Leased Premises is so prevented, but only to the extent of any
                  business interruption or loss of income insurance proceeds
                  actually received by Landlord from Tenant's insurance
                  described in Section 19.

            e.    Limited Termination. Except as set forth below, in case of any
                  damage or destruction occurring, during the Lease Term,
                  whether or not insurance proceeds are available for the
                  purpose of Restoration, this Lease shall remain in full force
                  and effect without any abatement, suspension, deferment,
                  diminution or reduction. If twenty percent (20%) or more of
                  the then replacement value of the Improvements is damaged by
                  fire or other casualty occurring during the final two (2)
                  Lease Years of the then running initial or extended Lease Term
                  and Landlord receives insurance proceeds sufficient to cover
                  any Rent loss due to such termination, Tenant may terminate
                  this Lease by written notice to Landlord within thirty (30)
                  days after the date of the fire or other casualty, effective
                  as of the date set forth in such termination notice, which
                  shall in no event be earlier than the thirtieth (30th) day
                  after the date of said termination notice, with Tenant to be
                  responsible for the payment of all Rent and Additional Charges
                  becoming due hereunder until the date of such termination;
                  provided, that Tenant shall pay or assign its right to receive
                  insurance proceeds from such damage or destruction over to
                  Landlord, with Tenant to also pay Landlord contemporaneously
                  with such termination the insurance deductible amount, if any,
                  applicable to such damage or destruction.

      21.   EMINENT DOMAIN.

            a.    Whole or Substantial Taking. If all or substantially all of
                  the Leased Premises shall be lawfully taken by condemnation or
                  other eminent domain proceedings pursuant to any law, general
                  or special, this Lease shall terminate on the date of such
                  taking. All Rent

                                  Page 16 of 42
<PAGE>
                  and Additional Charges required to be paid by Tenant under
                  this Lease shall be paid up to the date of such termination
                  and upon such termination this Lease shall be of no further
                  force and effect, except that any obligation or liability of
                  either party, actual or contingent, under this Lease which has
                  accrued on or prior to such termination date shall survive and
                  any prepayment of Rent and Additional Charges shall be
                  prorated between the parties. For purposes of this Section
                  "substantially all of the Leased Premises" shall be deemed to
                  mean such portion of the Leased Premises as, when so taken,
                  would leave remaining a balance of the Leased Premises which,
                  due either to the area so taken or the location of the part so
                  taken, in relation to the part not so taken, would not under
                  economic conditions, applicable zoning laws, building
                  regulations then existing or prevailing, reasonably
                  accommodate Tenant's business as conducted at the date of such
                  taking and after performance of all covenants, agreements,
                  terms and provisions herein and by law provided to be
                  performed and paid by Tenant. Tenant, in cooperation with
                  Landlord, shall have the right to participate in any
                  condemnation proceedings and be represented by legal counsel
                  for the purpose of protecting its interests hereunder.

            b.    Partial Taking. If only a portion of the Leased Premises shall
                  be so taken and Section 21(a) does not apply, this Lease shall
                  be unaffected by such taking, except that Rent payable by
                  Tenant pursuant to the provisions of this Lease shall be
                  equitably reduced by Landlord to a just and appropriate amount
                  according to the nature and extent of the taking.

            c.    Award. No award for any partial or total taking shall be
                  apportioned, it being agreed and understood that Landlord
                  shall be entitled to the entire award for any partial or
                  entire taking. Tenant assigns to Landlord its interest in any
                  award which may be made in such taking or condemnation,
                  together with any and all rights of Tenant arising in or to
                  the same or any part thereof. Nothing contained herein shall
                  be deemed to give Landlord any interest in or require Tenant
                  to assign to Landlord any separate award made to Tenant for
                  the taking of Tenant's Equipment, for the interruption of
                  Tenant's business or its moving costs or for the loss of
                  goodwill. Nothing herein contained shall prohibit Tenant from
                  making a separate claim, to the extent permitted by law, for
                  the value of Tenant's Equipment, moving expenses or relocation
                  benefits.

            d.    Temporary Taking. If the temporary use or occupancy of all or
                  any part of the Leased Premises shall be lawfully taken for
                  not more than one hundred eighty (180) days by condemnation or
                  in any other manner for any public or quasi-public use or
                  purpose during the Lease Term, Tenant shall be entitled to
                  receive that portion of the award for such taking which
                  represents compensation for the taking of Tenant's Equipment,
                  moving expenses or relocation benefits, and that portion which
                  represents reimbursement for the cost of Restoration pursuant
                  to Section 21(e). This Lease shall be and remain unaffected by
                  such taking and Tenant shall be responsible for all
                  obligations hereunder not affected by such taking and shall
                  continue to pay in full when due the Rent, Additional Charges
                  and all other sums, required to be paid by Tenant pursuant to
                  the provisions of this Lease. If the period of temporary use
                  or occupancy shall extend beyond the end of the Lease Term,
                  that part of the award which represents compensation for the
                  use or occupancy of the Leased Premises (or a part thereof)
                  shall be divided between Landlord and Tenant so that Tenant
                  shall receive so much thereof as represents the period to and
                  including the end of the Lease Term, and Landlord shall
                  receive so much as represents the period subsequent to the end
                  of the Lease Term.

            e.    Restoration. In the event of any taking of the Leased Premises
                  which does not result in a termination of this Lease, or in
                  the event of a taking for a temporary use or occupancy of all
                  or any part of the Leased Premises, Tenant at its expense
                  shall proceed with reasonable diligence with the Restoration
                  of the remaining parts of the Leased Premises to substantially
                  the condition existing immediately prior to the date of taking
                  to the extent that the same may be feasible to constitute a
                  complete and tenantable Leased Premises. Landlord shall
                  reimburse Tenant for the reasonable costs of the Restoration
                  of the Leased Premises in an amount not to exceed the amount
                  of the condemnation award specifically allocated to the
                  restoration of the Leased Premises; provided, however, that
                  Landlord shall use commercially reasonable efforts to seek
                  recovery of the reasonable costs of such Restoration as part
                  of the condemnation award and a specific allocation of such
                  costs in the award. If the condemnation award does not
                  specifically allocate any portion thereof for the restoration
                  of the Leased Premises, the Landlord shall reimburse Tenant
                  for the reasonable costs of the Restoration of the Leased
                  Premises in an amount not to exceed the amount of the
                  condemnation award in excess of the portion of the award
                  allocable to the real property taken, as Landlord shall
                  reasonably determine.

      22.   PERFORMANCE ON BEHALF OF TENANT. If Tenant shall fail to make any
            payment or perform any act required hereunder to be made or
            performed by Tenant, and provided Landlord has given Tenant ten (10)
            days written notice of its intent to do so and Tenant has failed
            during said period to make such payment or perform the act required
            to be performed by Tenant, subject to Unavoidable Delays, then
            Landlord may, but shall be under no obligation to, make such payment
            or perform such act with the same effect as if made or performed by
            Tenant. Notwithstanding, the immediately preceding sentence,
            Landlord may proceed immediately in the event of an emergency
            without any notice to Tenant other than bona fide attempts to
            contact by telephone as soon as reasonably possible under the
            circumstances either of Tenants' two (2) representatives (whom
            Tenant may change from time to time by providing written notice
            thereof) whose names and telephone numbers Tenant has furnished in
            writing to Landlord prior to such emergency. Entry by Landlord upon
            the Leased Premises for such purpose shall not waive or release
            Tenant from any obligation or an Event of Default hereunder. Tenant
            shall reimburse Landlord for all reasonable sums so paid by Landlord
            and all reasonable Costs and Expenses incurred by Landlord in
            connection with Landlord's payment or performance under this Section
            with interest at the Default Rate from the date of such payment by
            Landlord, and no such payment or performance by Landlord pursuant
            hereto, shall be deemed to suspend or delay the payment of any
            amount of money or charge at the time the same becomes due or
            payable, nor limit any right of Landlord or relieve Tenant from any
            Default hereunder.

      23.   ASSIGNMENTS AND SUBLEASES.

            a.    Tenant shall not do any of the following (collectively
                  referred to herein as a "TRANSFER"). whether voluntarily,
                  involuntarily or by operation of law, without the prior
                  written consent of Landlord, which consent shall not be
                  unreasonably withheld or delayed:

                          i. sublet all or any part of the Leased Premises or
                             allow it to be sublet, occupied or used by any
                             person or entity other than Tenant; or

                         ii. assign its interest in this Lease

                  In no event shall Tenant mortgage or encumber the Lease (or
                  otherwise use the Lease as a security device) in any manner.
                  Tenant shall reimburse Landlord for all reasonable costs

                                 Page 18 of 42
<PAGE>
                  and attorneys' and consultants' fees incurred by Landlord in
                  connection with the evaluation, processing and/or
                  documentation of any requested Transfer whether or not
                  Landlord's consent is granted. Any Transfer so approved by
                  Landlord shall not be effective until Tenant has delivered to
                  Landlord an executed counterpart of the document evidencing
                  the Transfer which: (x) is in a form reasonably approved by
                  Landlord; (y) contains the same terms and conditions as stated
                  in Tenant's notice given to Landlord pursuant to Section 23
                  (b); and (z) in the case of an assignment of the Lease,
                  contains the agreement of the proposed transferee to assume
                  all obligations of Tenant under this Lease arising after the
                  effective date of such Transfer and to remain jointly and
                  severally liable therefor with Tenant. Any Transfer without
                  Landlord's consent, where such consent is required, shall, at
                  Landlord's election in its sole and absolute discretion,
                  constitute a Default by Tenant and shall be voidable at
                  Landlord's option. Landlord's consent to any one Transfer
                  shall not constitute a waiver of the provisions of this
                  Section 23(a) as to any subsequent Transfer or a consent to
                  any subsequent Transfer. No Transfer, even with the consent of
                  Landlord, shall relieve Tenant of its personal and primary
                  obligation to pay the Rent and Additional Charges and to
                  perform all of the other obligations to be performed by Tenant
                  hereunder. The acceptance of Rent by Landlord from any person
                  shall not be deemed to be a waiver by Landlord of any
                  provision of this Lease nor to be a consent to any Transfer.

                  Subject to the following, any Transfer shall be upon then fair
                  market value. Tenant shall provide Landlord with a certified
                  appraisal performed by a Qualified Appraiser (as defined
                  hereinafter) justifying the proposed rent and terms of the
                  proposed Transfer ("TRANSFER APPRAISAL"). Tenant hereby agrees
                  that it shall not be unreasonable for the Landlord to withhold
                  its consent to a proposed Transfer if it is not on such terms
                  and conditions at least as beneficial to the Landlord as set
                  forth in the Transfer Appraisal; provided, however, that if
                  Tenant is unable to consummate a sublease or assignment after
                  two hundred seventy (270) days of marketing the property or
                  negotiating the sublease at fair market value as determined by
                  the Transfer Appraisal, Tenant enter into a Transfer upon such
                  terms as reasonably become available from potential subtenants
                  and/or assignees.

            b.    At least thirty (30) days before a proposed Transfer is to
                  become effective, Tenant shall give Landlord written notice of
                  the proposed terms of such Transfer and request Landlord's
                  approval, which notice shall include the following:

                          i. the name and legal composition of the proposed
                             transferee;

                         ii. a current financial statement of the transferee,
                             financial statements of the transferee covering the
                             preceding three (3) years if the same exist, and
                             (if available) an audited financial statement of
                             the transferee for a period ending not more than
                             one year prior to the proposed effective date of
                             the Transfer, all of which statements are prepared
                             in accordance with generally accepted accounting
                             principles;

                        iii. the nature of the proposed transferee's business to
                             be carried out in the Leased Premises;

                         iv. all consideration to be given on account of the
                             Transfer;

                          v. the proposed use of the proposed transferee;

                                  Page 19 of 42
<PAGE>
                         vi. the nature of any proposed tenant improvements or
                             Alterations;

                        vii. a copy of the Transfer Appraisal; and

                       viii. a current financial statement of Tenant (except
                             that such financial statement shall not be required
                             if Tenant is current in all filings required by the
                             Securities and Exchange Commission).

            c.    If Landlord consents to a Transfer proposed by Tenant, Tenant
                  may enter into such Transfer, and if Tenant does so, the
                  following shall apply:

                           i. Tenant shall not be released of its liability for
                              the performance of all of its obligations under
                              this Lease.

                          ii. If Tenant assigns its interest in this Lease, then
                              Tenant shall pay to Landlord two-thirds (2/3) of
                              all Transfer Consideration (as defined
                              hereinafter) received by Tenant over and above the
                              assignee's agreement to assume the obligations of
                              Tenant under this Lease.

                         iii. If Tenant sublets any part of the Leased Premises,
                              then with respect to the space so subleased,
                              Tenant shall pay to Landlord two-thirds (2/3) of
                              the positive difference, if any, between all
                              Transfer Consideration paid by the subtenant to
                              Tenant, less Base Rent, allocable to the space
                              sublet. Landlord shall reasonably determine the
                              Base Rent fairly allocable to the portion so
                              subleased. Such amount shall be paid to Landlord
                              on the same basis and at the same time, whether
                              periodic or in lump sum, that such Transfer
                              Consideration is paid to Tenant by its subtenant.

                          iv. Tenant's obligations under this .Section 23(c)
                              shall survive any Transfer, and Tenant's failure
                              to perform its obligations hereunder shall be an
                              Event of Tenant's Default. Landlord shall have the
                              right at reasonable intervals to inspect Tenant's
                              books and records relating to the payments due
                              hereunder. Upon request therefor, Tenant shall
                              deliver to Landlord copies of all bills, invoices
                              or other documents upon which its calculations are
                              based. Landlord may condition its approval of any
                              Transfer upon obtaining a certification from both
                              Tenant and the proposed transferee of all Transfer
                              Consideration and other amounts that are to be
                              paid to Tenant in connection with such Transfer.

                           v. As used in this Section 23(c), the term "TRANSFER
                              CONSIDERATION" shall mean the positive difference,
                              if any of: (i) any consideration of any kind
                              received, or to be received, by Tenant as a
                              result of the Transfer, if such, sums are related
                              to Tenant's interest in this Lease or in the
                              Leased Premises; minus (ii) all Costs and Expenses
                              reasonably related to the Transfer, including,
                              without limitation, brokerage fees and
                              commissions, legal fees, and Costs and Expenses of
                              Alterations and tenant improvements related to the
                              Transfer. The Costs and Expenses set forth in
                              Section 23(c)(v)(ii) shall not exceed two (2)
                              months base rent under the applicable sublease or
                              assignment.

                          vi. Tenant shall conditionally assign and transfer to
                              Landlord its interests in the sublease and all
                              rentals and income arising therefrom. Unless and
                              until Tenant Defaults in performing any of its
                              obligations under this Lease, Tenant may

                                 Page 20 of 42
<PAGE>
                              receive, collect, and enjoy the rents accruing
                              under the sublease. The condition to the
                              assignment shall be that if Tenant Defaults in any
                              performing any of its obligations under this
                              Lease, Landlord may, at its option (which may be
                              exercised in Landlord's sole and absolute
                              discretion) by notice to Tenant and the sublessee,
                              do either of the following:

                                    1.   in pursuit of Landlord's remedies
                                         hereunder, terminate the sublease in
                                         conjunction with a termination of this
                                         Lease; or

                                    2.   elect to receive and collect, directly
                                         from the sublessee, all rent and any
                                         other sums owing and to be owed under
                                         the sublease, as further set forth in
                                         Section 23(c)(vii) below.

                              If the Landlord elects to receive and collect rent
                              and other sums owing under the sublease, such
                              shall not limit the Tenant's right to receive any
                              Transfer Consideration it is entitled to pursuant
                              to Section 23(c)(ii) or (iii), as applicable;
                              provided, however, the Landlord may receive and
                              collect such Transfer Consideration on behalf of
                              Tenant and apply such to remedy any Default of
                              Tenant and/or apply such to the Security Deposit.

                         vii. Landlord will not, as a result of the sublease, or
                              as a result of the collection of rents or any
                              other sums from the sublessee under Section
                              23(c)(vi) above, be liable to the sublessee for
                              any failure of Tenant, as sublessor, to perform
                              any obligation of Tenant, as sublessor, under the
                              sublease. Amongst such other provisions as the
                              Landlord shall reasonably require, the sublease
                              document and/or the consent to sublease document
                              shall contain the following provisions:

                                    1.   Tenant shall irrevocably authorize and
                                         direct the sublessee, on receipt of any
                                         written notices from Landlord stating
                                         that a Default exists in the
                                         performance of any of Tenant's
                                         obligations under this Lease, to pay to
                                         Landlord the rents and any other sums
                                         due and to become due under the
                                         sublease.

                                    2.   Tenant shall agree that the sublessee
                                         has the right to rely on any such
                                         statement from Landlord, and that the
                                         sublessee will pay those rents and
                                         other sums to Landlord without any
                                         obligation or right to inquire as to
                                         whether a default exists and despite
                                         any notice or claim from Tenant to the
                                         contrary.

                                    3.   Tenant will not have any right or claim
                                         against the sublessee for those rents
                                         or other sums paid by the sublessee to
                                         Landlord. Landlord will credit Tenant
                                         with any rent actually received by
                                         Landlord under this assignment, but the
                                         acceptance of any payment on account of
                                         rent from the sublessee as the result
                                         of a default by Tenant will not:

                                             a.   be an attornment by Landlord
                                                  to the sublessee or by the
                                                  sublessee to Landlord;

                                             b.   be a waiver by Landlord of any
                                                  provision of the Lease; or

                                  Page 21 of 42
<PAGE>
                                             c.   release the Tenant from any
                                                  liability under the terms,
                                                  agreements or conditions of
                                                  the Lease;

                                         No payment of rent by the sublessee
                                         directly to Landlord, regardless of the
                                         circumstance or reasons for that
                                         payment, will be deemed an attornment
                                         to Landlord by the sublessee in the
                                         absence of a specific written agreement
                                         signed by Landlord to that effect.

                                    4.   In the event the Lease is terminated
                                         prior to the expiration of the term of
                                         the sublease, Landlord shall have the
                                         right, at Landlord's option (which may
                                         be exercised in Landlord's sole and
                                         absolute discretion), pursuant to
                                         notice to the sublessee, to succeed to
                                         Tenant's interest as sublessor in the
                                         sublease and cause the sublessee to
                                         attorn to Landlord on the terms and
                                         conditions of the sublease. Within ten
                                         (10) days of Landlord's request, the
                                         sublessee shall execute and deliver to
                                         Landlord an attornment agreement in
                                         such form and with such content as
                                         Landlord may reasonably require. If
                                         Landlord exercises its option, Landlord
                                         will so assume the obligations of
                                         Tenant, as sublessor, under the
                                         sublease from the time of the exercise
                                         of the option, but Landlord will not
                                         be:

                                             a.   liable for any rent paid by
                                                  the sublessee to Tenant more
                                                  than one month in advance, or
                                                  for any security deposit paid
                                                  by the sublessee to Tenant
                                                  (unless actually received by
                                                  Landlord);

                                             b.   liable for any act or omission
                                                  of the Tenant under the Lease
                                                  or for any default of Tenant,
                                                  as sublessor, under the
                                                  sublease which occurred prior
                                                  to Landlord's assumption;

                                             c.   subject to any defenses or
                                                  offsets that the sublessee may
                                                  have against Tenant, as
                                                  sublessor, which arose prior
                                                  to Landlord's assumption; or

                                             d.   bound by any changes or
                                                  modifications made to the
                                                  sublease without the prior
                                                  written consent of Landlord.

                                         If Landlord does not elect to assume
                                         Tenant's interest as sublessor in the
                                         sublease, the sublease shall terminate
                                         concurrently with the termination of
                                         this Lease.

                                    5.   The sublease shall not be subject to
                                         amendment or modification without the
                                         prior written consent of Landlord,
                                         which consent shall not be unreasonably
                                         withheld.

                                    6.   The sublessee shall not be permitted to
                                         terminate the sublease without first
                                         providing written notice to the
                                         Landlord and providing Landlord with a
                                         reasonable period of time (of not less
                                         than thirty (30) days) to cure Tenant's
                                         default, as sublessor, under the
                                         Sublease. Such notice shall specify the
                                         nature of the default giving rise to
                                         the sublessee's right to terminate the
                                         Lease. Under no circumstances shall the
                                         Landlord be required to cure such
                                         default and may do so in its sole and
                                         absolute discretion.

            d.    The sale of all or substantially all of Tenant's assets (other
                  than bulk sales in the ordinary course of business), any
                  dissolution of Tenant, or, the transfer, assignment and/or
                  hypothecation of any stock in Tenant, in the aggregate in
                  excess of twenty-five percent (25%) during the Lease Term;
                  excepting therefrom transfers in the aggregate in excess of
                  twenty-five percent (25%) during the Lease Term, but not more
                  than fifty percent (50%) during the Lease Term, where no
                  change in the controlling interests of Tenant occurs as a
                  result thereof, shall be deemed an assignment within the
                  meaning and provisions of this Section 23.

            e.    Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary,
                  Tenant may, without Landlord's consent or participation,
                  transfer this Lease or sublease all or a portion of the Leased
                  Premises to:

                           i. any corporation or other legal entity which

                              ("AFFILIATE");

                          ii. any corporation or other legal entity not less
                              than fifty percent (50%) of whose outstanding
                              stock or beneficial interest shall, at the time,
                              be owned directly or indirectly by Tenant
                              ("SUBSIDIARY"); or

                              for merger or consolidation, if any, provided that
                              by operation of law or by effective provisions
                              contained in the instruments of merger or

                              assumed by the corporation or other legal entity
                              surviving such merger or created by such
                              consolidation ("SUCCESSOR").

                  For purposes of this Section 23(e), "CONTROL" shall mean the
                  possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or
                  cause the direction of the management and policies of such
                  corporation or other legal entity, whether through the

                  a portion the Leased Premises to an Affiliate, Subsidiary or
                  Successor, Tenant shall, within ten (10) days after the
                  effective date of such Transfer, provide Landlord with an
                  assignment and assumption agreement or sublease, as
                  applicable, in substance and form reasonably acceptable to
                  Landlord.

            f.    Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section 23 to the
                  contrary, in the event that Tenant requests Landlord's consent
                  to a Transfer, Landlord shall have the following rights:

                           i. The right to terminate this Lease; or

                          ii. In the case of a sublease of less than fifty
                              percent (50%) of the Leased Premises, terminate
                              this Lease as to that part of the Leased Premises
                              requested to be sublet; or

                              this Lease in full or as to that part of the
                              Leased Premises requested to be so sublet, as
                              Landlord shall determine in its sole and absolute
                              discretion, either;

                                    1.   On the condition that the proposed
                                         transferee immediately enter into a
                                         direct lease of the Leased Premises
                                         with Landlord (or, in the case of a
                                         partial sublease, a lease for the
                                         portion requested to be so sublet) on
                                         the same terms and conditions contained
                                         in the requested sublease or such other
                                         terms and conditions as Landlord may
                                         reasonably designate; or

                                    2.   So that Landlord is thereafter free to
                                         lease the Leased Premises (or, in the
                                         case of a partial sublease, the portion
                                         requested to be so sublet) to whomever
                                         (including, without limitation, the
                                         proposed transferee) it pleases on
                                         whatever terms are acceptable to
                                         Landlord in its sole and absolute
                                         discretion.

                          iv. In the event Landlord elects to so terminate this
                              Lease as set forth above, then:

                                    1.   If such termination is conditioned upon
                                         the execution of a lease between
                                         Landlord and the proposed transferee,
                                         Tenant's obligations under this Lease
                                         shall not be terminated until such
                                         transferee executes a new lease with
                                         Landlord, enters into possession and
                                         commences the payment of rent; and

                                    2.   If Landlord elects simply to terminate
                                         this Lease (or, in the case of a
                                         partial sublease, terminate this Lease
                                         as to the portion requested to be so
                                         sublet), the Lease shall so terminate
                                         in its entirety (or as to the space
                                         requested to be so sublet) fifteen (15)
                                         days after Landlord has notified Tenant
                                         in writing of such election.

                                    3.   Upon such termination, Tenant shall be
                                         released from any further obligation
                                         under this Lease if it is terminated in
                                         its entirety (or shall be released
                                         from any further obligation under the
                                         Lease with respect to the space
                                         requested to be so sublet in the case
                                         of requested partial sublease), except
                                         that the foregoing release shall not
                                         apply to, and Tenant shall not be
                                         released from:

                                                  a.   Any obligations under
                                                       this Lease accruing prior
                                                       to such termination;

                                                  b.   Any obligations under
                                                       Section 31 below relating
                                                       to the surrender of the
                                                       Leased Premises or such
                                                       space requested to be so
                                                       sublet, as applicable;
                                                       and

                                                  c.   Any obligations which, by
                                                       their terms, are to
                                                       survive the expiration or
                                                       sooner termination of
                                                       this Lease.

                                    4.   In the case of a partial termination of
                                         the Lease, Landlord shall equitably
                                         adjust, as Landlord shall reasonably
                                         determine, the Base Rent and allocate
                                         costs and expenses related to common
                                         area maintenance and Impositions to the
                                         Tenant based upon the value of the
                                         Leased Premises not so terminated.

                                         execute a separate termination
                                         agreement evidencing any termination of
                                         this Lease and/or amendment to this
                                         Lease evidencing the matters set forth
                                         herein.

      24.   EVENTS OF DEFAULT; TERMINATION.

            a.    Events of Default. Any one or more of the following specified
                  events shall be a "DEFAULT":

                           i. if Tenant shall fail to pay any Base Rent when the
                              same becomes due and payable, and if such failure
                              continues for more than five (5) days after
                              written notice of non-payment of Rent has been
                              given by Landlord to Tenant. If so stated in the
                              notice of default, the notice of default shall
                              also constitute a demand for possession under the
                              forcible entry and detainer statutes; or

                          ii. if Tenant shall fail to pay, when the same becomes
                              due and payable, any Additional Charges or other
                              Rent and such failure shall continue for more than
                              five (5) days after written notice of such
                              non-payment has been given by Landlord to Tenant;
                              or

                         iii. if Tenant shall fail to perform or comply with any
                              other obligation of Tenant under this Lease, and
                              such failure shall continue for more than thirty
                              (30) days after notice thereof has been given by
                              Landlord to Tenant, and Tenant shall not, subject
                              to Unavoidable Delays, within such thirty (30) day
                              period commence with due diligence the curing of
                              such default, or, having so commenced, shall
                              thereafter fail or neglect, for reasons other than
                              Unavoidable Delays, to diligently pursue or
                              complete the curing of such default, such extended

                              after notice thereof from Landlord; or

                          iv. if Tenant shall make a general assignment for the
                              benefit of creditors, or shall admit in writing
                              its inability to pay its debts as they become due
                              or shall file a petition in bankruptcy, or shall
                              be adjudicated a bankrupt or insolvent, or shall
                              file a petition seeking any reorganization,

                              any present or future statute, law or regulation
                              due to its bankrupt or insolvent financial status;

                           v. if, as a result of any proceeding against Tenant,
                              a decree or order of a court or agency or
                              supervisory authority having jurisdiction in the

                              to the Tenant or of or relating to all or
                              substantially all of its property, or for the
                              winding-up or liquidation of its affairs or for
                              the supervision of the business or affairs of
                              Tenant, shall have been entered, and such decree
                              or order shall have remained in force undischarged

                          vi. Tenant shall have sublet the Leased Premises or
                              assigned its interest in this Lease in violation

                        viii. Tenant shall have failed to deliver documents
                              required of it pursuant to Sections 25(a) or (b)
                              within the time periods specified therein;

                          ix. Tenant shall have defaulted beyond applicable cure
                              periods under any loan, security agreement,
                              security instrument, promissory note, or other
                              obligation whatsoever under which Tenant is
                              required to perform in any manner whatsoever; or

                           x. Chronic delinquency by Tenant in the payment of
                              any Rent. For purposes of this Lease, "CHRONIC
                              DELINQUENCY" shall mean failure by Tenant to pay
                              within five (5) days of the due date any Rent for
                              any two (2) months (consecutive or
                              non-consecutive) during any Lease Year. This
                              section shall in no way limit, nor be construed as
                              a waiver of the rights and remedies of Landlord
                              provided hereunder or by law in the event of even
                              one (1) instance of delinquency in the payment of
                              Rent by Tenant. In the event of chronic
                              delinquency, at Landlord's option, Landlord shall
                              have the right, in addition to all other rights
                              under this Lease and at law, to require that
                              Tenant pay all Rent on a quarterly basis, in
                              advance, and make all Rent payments via electronic
                              transfer of funds.

            b.    Remedies.

                           i. In the event of any default and breach by Tenant
                              of any of its obligations under this Lease and
                              notwithstanding the vacation or abandonment of the
                              Leased Premises by Tenant, this Lease shall
                              continue in effect so long as Landlord does not
                              expressly terminate Tenant's right to possession
                              in any of the manners specified in this paragraph
                              and Landlord may, at Landlord's option and without
                              limiting Landlord in the exercise of any other
                              rights or remedies which it may have by reason of
                              such default and breach, exercise all of its
                              rights and remedies hereunder, including, without
                              limitation:

                                    1.   The right to declare the Lease Term
                                         ended and to reenter the Leased
                                         Premises and take possession thereof
                                         and remove all persons therefrom, and
                                         Tenant shall have no further claim in
                                         or to the Leased Premises or under this
                                         Lease; or

                                    2.   The right without declaring this Lease
                                         ended to reenter the Leased Premises,
                                         take possession thereof, remove all
                                         persons therefrom and occupy or lease
                                         the whole or any part thereof for and
                                         on account of Tenant and upon such
                                         terms and conditions and for such rent
                                         as Landlord may deem proper and to
                                         collect such rent or any other rent
                                         that may hereafter become payable and
                                         apply the same as provided in Section
                                         24(b)(ii); or

                                    3.   The right, even though Landlord may
                                         have relet the Leased Premises or
                                         brought an action to collect Rent and
                                         other charges without terminating this
                                         Lease, to thereafter elect to terminate
                                         this Lease and all of the rights of
                                         Tenant in or to the Leased Premises; or

                                    4.   The right, without terminating this
                                         Lease, to bring an action or actions to
                                         collect Rent and other charges
                                         hereunder which are from time to time
                                         past due and unpaid or to enforce any
                                         other provisions of this Lease

                                         imposing obligations on Tenant, it
                                         being understood that the bringing of
                                         any such action or actions shall not
                                         terminate this Lease unless written
                                         notice of termination is given.

                          ii. Should Landlord relet the Leased Premises under
                              the provisions of Section 24(b)(i)(2), Landlord
                              may execute any lease either in its own name or in
                              the name of Tenant, but Tenant hereunder shall
                              have no right or authority whatever to collect any
                              rent from the new tenant. The proceeds of any such
                              reletting shall first be applied to the payment of
                              the costs and expenses of reletting the Leased
                              Premises, including without limitation, reasonable
                              brokerage commissions and alterations and repairs
                              which Landlord, in its sole and absolute
                              discretion, deems necessary and advisable and to
                              the payment of reasonable attorneys' fees and
                              costs incurred by Landlord in connection with
                              Tenant's default, the retaking of the Leased
                              Premises and such reletting and, second, to the
                              payment of any indebtedness, other than Rent, due
                              hereunder, including, without limitation, storage
                              charges owing from Tenant to Landlord. When such
                              costs and expenses of reletting have been paid,
                              and if there is no such indebtedness or such
                              indebtedness has been paid, Tenant shall be
                              entitled to a credit for the net amount of rental
                              received from such reletting each month during the
                              unexpired balance of the Lease Term, and Tenant
                              shall pay Landlord monthly on the first day of
                              each month as specified herein such sums as may
                              be required to make up the rentals provided for in
                              this Lease. Nothing contained herein shall be
                              construed as obligating Landlord to relet the
                              whole or any part of the Leased Premises.

                         iii. Should Landlord elect to terminate this Lease
                              under the provisions of Section 24(b)(i)(1) or (3)
                              above, Landlord shall be entitled to recover
                              immediately from Tenant (in addition to any other
                              amounts recoverable by Landlord as provided by
                              law), the following amounts:

                                    1.   The worth at the time of award of the
                                         unpaid rent which had been earned at
                                         the time of termination;

                                    2.   The worth at the time of award of the
                                         amount by which the unpaid rent which
                                         would have been earned after
                                         termination until the time of award
                                         exceeds the amount of such rental loss
                                         that Tenant proves could have been
                                         reasonably avoided;

                                    3.   The worth at the time of award of the
                                         amount by which the unpaid rent for the
                                         balance of the Term after the time of
                                         award exceeds the amount of such rental
                                         loss that Tenant proves could be
                                         reasonably avoided; and

                                    4.   Any other amount necessary to
                                         compensate Landlord for all the
                                         detriment proximately caused by
                                         Tenant's failure to perform its
                                         obligations under the Lease or which in
                                         the ordinary course of things would be
                                         likely to result therefrom.

                              For purposes of computing "the worth at the time
                              of the award" of the amount specified in Section
                              24(b)(iii)(3) above, such amount shall be
                              discounted at the discount rate of the Federal
                              Reserve Bank of San Francisco at the time of
                              award. For purposes of computing "the worth at the
                              time of the award" under

                                  Page 27 of 42

                              Section 24(b)(iii)(l) or (2) above, an interest
                              rate of ten percent (10%) per annum shall be
                              utilized.

                          iv. If Landlord shall elect to reenter the Leased
                              Premises as provided above, Landlord shall not be
                              liable for damages by reason of any reentry.
                              Tenant hereby waives all claims and demands
                              against Landlord for damages or loss arising out
                              of or in connection with any reentering and
                              taking possession of the Leased Premises and
                              waives all claims for damages or loss arising out
                              of or in connection with any destruction of or
                              damage to the Leased Premises, or for any loss of
                              property belonging to Tenant or to any other
                              person, firm or corporation which may be in or
                              upon the Leased Premises at the time of such
                              reentry.

                           v. Landlord shall not be deemed to have terminated
                              this Lease, Tenant's right to possession of the
                              Leased Premises or the liability of Tenant to pay
                              Rent thereafter to accrue or its liability for
                              damages under any of the provisions hereof by any
                              reentry hereunder or by any action in unlawful
                              detainer or otherwise to obtain possession of the
                              Leased Premises, unless Landlord shall notify
                              Tenant in writing that Landlord has so elected to
                              terminate this Lease. Tenant agrees that the
                              service by Landlord of any notice pursuant to the
                              unlawful detainer statutes or comparable statutes
                              of the state or locality in which the Leased
                              Premises are located and the surrender of
                              possession pursuant to such notice shall not
                              (unless Landlord elects to the contrary at the
                              time of or at any time subsequent to the service
                              of such notice and such election shall be
                              evidenced by a written notice to Tenant) be deemed
                              to be a termination of this Lease or of Tenant's
                              obligations hereunder. No reentry or reletting
                              under this paragraph shall be deemed to constitute
                              a surrender or termination of this Lease, or of
                              any of the rights, options, elections, powers
                              and remedies reserved by Landlord hereunder, or a
                              release of Tenant from any of its obligations
                              hereunder, unless Landlord shall specifically
                              notify Tenant, in writing, to that effect. No such
                              reletting shall preclude Landlord from thereafter
                              at any time terminating this Lease as herein
                              provided.

                          vi. All fixtures, furnishings, goods, equipment,
                              chattels or other personal property of Tenant
                              remaining on the Leased Premises at the time that
                              Landlord takes possession thereof may at
                              Landlord's election be stored at Tenant's expense
                              or sold or otherwise disposed of by Landlord in
                              any manner permitted by applicable law.

                         vii. In the event of the exercise by Landlord of any
                              one or more of its rights and remedies hereunder,
                              Tenant hereby expressly waives any and all rights
                              of redemption, if any, granted by or under any
                              present or future laws.

            c.    Cumulative Remedies. Each right, option, power, election and
                  remedy of Landlord provided for in this Lease or now or
                  hereafter existing at law or in equity or by statute or
                  otherwise shall be, cumulative and concurrent and shall be in
                  addition to every other right, power or remedy provided for in
                  this Lease or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or
                  by statute or otherwise, and the exercise or beginning of the
                  exercise by Landlord of any one or more of the rights, powers
                  or remedies provided for in this Lease or now or hereafter
                  existing at law or in equity or by statute or otherwise shall
                  not prejudice, preclude or impair the simultaneous or later
                  exercise by Landlord of any or all such other rights, options,
                  powers, elections or remedies Landlord may have upon a

                                  Page 28 of 42
<PAGE>
                  breach and default under this Lease and shall not be deemed to
                  be a waiver of Landlord's rights or remedies thereupon or to
                  be a release of Tenant from Tenant's obligations thereon
                  unless such waiver or release is expressed in writing and
                  signed by Landlord.

            d.    Recovery of Costs and Expenses. If any action, whether at law
                  or equity, is instituted by either party for default by the
                  other under this Lease, the prevailing party shall be awarded
                  all Costs and Expenses incident thereto.

            e.    Limitation of Landlord Liability. Any claim, demand or right
                  of any kind by Tenant which is based upon or arises in
                  connection with this Lease shall be barred unless Tenant
                  commences an action thereon within twelve (12) months after
                  the date that Tenant discovers or, in the exercise of
                  reasonable diligence, should have discovered, the act,
                  omission, event or default upon which the claim, demand or
                  right in question arises, has occurred. In consideration of
                  the benefits accruing hereunder, Tenant and all successors and
                  assigns covenant and agree that, in the event of any actual or
                  alleged breach or default hereunder by Landlord:

                           i. the sole and exclusive remedy and source of
                              recovery for any judgment or award shall be
                              against Landlord's interest in the Leased
                              Premises;

                          ii. no limited partner, member, shareholder or other
                              owner of Landlord (excepting general partners)
                              (collectively, "LANDLORD OWNER") shall be sued or
                              named as a party in any suit or action (except as
                              may be necessary to secure jurisdiction of the
                              partnership);

                         iii. no service of process shall be made against any
                              Landlord Owner (except as may be necessary to
                              secure jurisdiction of Landlord);

                          iv. no Landlord Owner shall be required to answer or
                              otherwise plead to any service of process;

                           v. no judgment will be taken against any Landlord
                              Owner;

                          vi. any judgment taken against any Landlord Owner may
                              be vacated and set aside at any time without
                              hearing;

                         vii. no writ of execution will ever be levied against
                              the assets of any Landlord Owner;

                        viii. in no event shall Landlord be liable to Tenant for
                              punitive, special, indirect or consequential
                              damages; and

                          ix. these covenants and agreements are enforceable
                              both by Landlord and also by any Landlord Owner.

                  Tenant agrees that each of the foregoing covenants and
                  agreements shall be applicable to any covenant or agreement
                  either expressly contained in this Lease or imposed by statute
                  or at common law.

      25.   ESTOPPEL CERTIFICATES AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

            a.    Estoppel Certificate by Tenant. Tenant, any sublessee or
                  assignee or all of any portion of Tenant's interest under
                  this Lease, will execute, acknowledge and deliver to Landlord,
                  within fifteen (15) days of Landlord's written request, a
                  certificate certifying:

                           i. this Lease is unmodified and in full force and
                              effect (or, if there have been modifications, that
                              the Lease is in full force and effect, as
                              modified, and stating the modifications);

                          ii. the dates, if any, to which Rent, Additional
                              Charges and other sums payable hereunder have been
                              paid;

                         iii. no notice has been received by Tenant of any
                              Default which has not been cured, except as
                              otherwise specified in such certificate, or, if
                              there is an uncured Default, specifying the nature
                              of such;

                          iv. Landlord is not in default hereunder and no event
                              which, with the passing of time, giving of notice,
                              or both, would constitute a default by Landlord
                              hereunder; and

                           v. certifying such other information about the status
                              of the Lease and the Leased Premises as may be
                              required by Landlord.

                  A failure to deliver an estoppel certificate within fifteen
                  (15) days after delivery of a request therefor shall be a
                  conclusive admission that, as of the date of the request for
                  such statement: (w) this Lease is unmodified except as may be
                  represented by Landlord in said request and is in full force
                  and effect, (x) there are no uncured defaults in Landlord's
                  performance, (y) no rent has been paid more than thirty (30)
                  days in advance; and (z) the information regarding the status
                  of the Lease, as represented by Landlord in said request, is
                  true and correct. Any such certificate may be relied upon by
                  any permitted prospective transferee, deed of trust
                  beneficiary or mortgagee of Landlord's interest under this
                  Lease.

            b.    Tenant's Financial Statements. At any time during the Lease
                  Term, Tenant shall, upon ten (10) days' prior written notice
                  from Landlord, provide Tenant's most recent financial
                  statement and financial statements covering the twenty-four
                  (24) month period prior to the date of such most recent
                  financial statement to any lender of Landlord, any potential
                  lender of Landlord or potential buyer of the Leased Premises.
                  Such statements shall be prepared in accordance with generally
                  accepted accounting principles and shall be certified by
                  Tenant's chief financial officer as true and correct in all
                  material respects or, if such is the normal practice of
                  Tenant, shall be audited by an independent certified public
                  accountant. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenant shall not be
                  obligated to provide Landlord with financial information as
                  set forth in this Section 25(b) for so long as Tenant is
                  required to, and does, file such information with the
                  Securities and Exchange Commission.

            c.    Estoppel Certificate by Landlord. Landlord will execute,
                  acknowledge and deliver to Tenant, within fifteen (15) days of
                  Tenant's written request, a certificate certifying:

                           i. that this Lease is unmodified and in full force
                              and effect (or, if there have been modifications,
                              that this Lease is in full force and effect as
                              modified, and stating the modifications);

                                  Page 30 of 42
<PAGE>
                          ii. the dates, if any, to which Rent, Additional
                              Charges and other sums payable hereunder have been
                              paid; and

                        iii.  whether or not, to the knowledge of Landlord,
                              there then exists any Default under this Lease
                              (and if so, specifying the same).

                  A failure to deliver an estoppel certificate within fifteen
                  (15) days after delivery of a request therefor shall be a
                  conclusive admission that, as of the date of the request for
                  such statement: (w) this Lease is unmodified except as may be
                  represented by Landlord in said request and is in full force
                  and effect, (x) there are no uncured defaults in Tenant's
                  performance, (y) no rent has been paid more than thirty (30)
                  days in advance; and (z) the information regarding the status
                  of the Lease, as represented by Tenant in said request, is
                  true and correct. Any such certificate may be relied upon by
                  any permitted prospective assignee, sublessee or other
                  transferee of all or part of Tenant's interest under this
                  Lease.

      26.   SUBORDINATION AND ATTORNMENT. This Lease, at Landlord's option,
            shall be subordinate to any mortgage or deed of trust which may be
            placed against the Leased Premises and to any and all advances made
            or to be made pursuant to any such mortgage or deed of trust, and to
            all renewals, replacements and extensions of any such mortgage or
            deed of trust; provided that each such subordination shall be on the
            condition that the mortgagee or deed of trust beneficiary and
            trustee shall execute and deliver to Tenant an agreement ("SNDA") to
            the effect that, so long as a Default caused by Tenant is not
            occurring hereunder, such mortgagee, beneficiary or trustee will
            recognize this Lease and not disturb or otherwise interfere with
            Tenant's leasehold and other rights under this Lease. The form and
            substance of such document shall be in form and content as may
            reasonably be required by Landlord's lender or potential lender, as
            the case may be. Tenant shall execute and deliver the SNDA within
            fifteen (15) days after written request by Landlord.

      27.   OPTIONS TO EXTEND. Subject to the provisions of Section 24(a)(ix)
            above and provided that no Default shall have occurred and be
            continuing at the time this Option is exercised, Landlord hereby
            grants to Tenant three (3) successive options (collectively, the
            "OPTIONS", and each an "OPTION") to extend the Lease Term of this
            Lease for three (3) successive periods of five (5) consecutive Lease
            Years each. Tenant may exercise each Option only by giving Landlord
            written notice thereof not less than twelve (12) months, no more
            than eighteen (18) months prior to the expiration of the then
            running initial or extended Lease Term, as the case may be. The
            covenants, terms and conditions between Landlord and Tenant during
            each such extended term shall be the same as contained in this Lease
            for the initial Lease Term, except that Tenant shall have no further
            right to extend the Lease Term, and the Base Rent payable during
            each such extended term for which Tenant exercises this Option shall
            be adjusted for the first Lease Year of the applicable Option to
            equal the greater of:

            a.    one hundred and two percent (102%) of the Base Rent due for
                  the preceding Lease Year; and

            b.    Fair Market Rental of the Leased Premises as of the beginning
                  of the extended term ("OPTION DATE") as hereinafter set forth:
                  '

                           i. Between the three hundred sixty-fifth (365th) and
                              one hundred eightieth (180th) day prior to the
                              Option Date, Landlord and Tenant shall attempt to
                              agree by a written and signed addendum to this
                              Lease on the Fair Market Rental to be payable
                              during such extended term. If Landlord and Tenant
                              are unable to agree

                              on such Fair Market Rental or fail to execute the
                              addendum by the one hundred eightieth (180th) day
                              preceding the Option Date, then, within thirty
                              (30) days thereafter Landlord and Tenant shall
                              each select a Qualified Appraiser and use the
                              appraisal mechanism set forth in Section 28 to
                              determine the Fair Market Rental.

                          ii. If for any reason the Fair Market Rental has not
                              been determined as of the Option Date, Tenant
                              shall continue to pay Base Rent to Landlord in an
                              amount of Landlord's lowest proposal during the
                              negotiations set forth in Section 27(b)(i) above,
                              and, when the Fair Market Rental for the extended
                              term is determined, Tenant within thirty (30) days
                              following Landlord's notice thereof, shall pay to
                              Landlord the amount of any increase for each month
                              during which Tenant paid a lower monthly
                              installment of Base Rent, or, if Tenant has over
                              paid Base Rent, Tenant shall receive a credit for
                              such amounts against Base Rent next coming due.

            c.    Further, the Base Rent for each Lease Year during an Option
                  after the first Lease Year during said Option shall be
                  increased by two percent (2%) over the preceding Lease Year.

            d.    The exercise of all preceding Option(s) is a condition
                  precedent to the exercise of any subsequent Option(s).

            e.    Any references in this Lease to the Lease Term shall mean the
                  initial Lease Term as extended pursuant to this Section.

      28.   APPRAISAL. Any appraisal of the Fair Market Rental of the Leased
            Premises required or permitted hereunder shall be made by either
            Landlord or Tenant selecting and notifying the other party hereto of
            the name and address of an appraiser who is duly licensed in the
            state where the Leased Premises are located, who is a member of the
            American Institute of Real Estate Appraisers ("M.A.I") and who is
            knowledgeable concerning the sale and rental values of properties
            similar to and located in the same State and County as the Leased
            Premises (a "QUALIFIED APPRAISER"). Within fifteen (15) days after
            being notified of the name and address of a Qualified Appraiser,
            such other party hereto shall select and notify Landlord or Tenant
            (as the case may be) of the name and address of a second Qualified
            Appraiser. Within ten (10) days after the expiration of the
            aforesaid fifteen (15) day period, the two Qualified Appraisers
            shall select and notify Landlord and Tenant of the name and address
            of a third Qualified Appraiser ("THIRD APPRAISER"). The first two
            Qualified Appraisers selected by Landlord and Tenant each shall make
            an independent and separate appraisal ("APPRAISAL") of the Fair
            Market Rental of the Leased Premises, and shall furnish copies of
            each such Appraisal to each other, to the Third Appraiser, and to
            Landlord and Tenant within thirty (30) days after the expiration of
            the aforesaid fifteen (15) day period. Within fifteen (15) days
            after the expiration of the aforesaid thirty (30) day period, the
            Third Appraiser will notify Landlord and Tenant of which Appraisal
            the Third Appraiser has selected as the closer to the Fair Market
            Rental of the Leased Premises. For the purposes hereof, the term
            "FAIR MARKET RENTAL" means the rental during the applicable term
            that a willing tenant would pay a willing landlord, neither of whom
            is compelled to rent. In no event shall the Fair Market Rental
            during the extended term under Section 27 be less than one hundred
            two percent (102%) of the Base Rent payable by Tenant for the Lease
            Year immediately prior to the Option Date for such extended term. If
            either Landlord or Tenant fails to appoint its Qualified Appraiser
            and send notice thereof to the other party as required herein, the
            one appointed Qualified

                                  Page 32 of 42
<PAGE>
            Appraiser promptly shall appoint a second Qualified Appraiser and
            the Third Appraiser shall be selected as set forth hereinabove. If
            Landlord and Tenant each shall appoint a Qualified Appraiser, but
            such two Qualified Appraisers are unable to agree within the
            required time upon the selection of a Third Appraiser, the Third
            Appraiser shall be selected by the mutual agreement of the Landlord
            and Tenant, if the Landlord and Tenant are unable to so agree within
            ten (10) days, the Third Appraiser shall be selected by the then
            presiding civil judge of the Superior Court of Arizona in and for
            Maricopa County. The determination of the Fair Market Rental in
            accordance with the foregoing procedures shall be final and binding
            upon Landlord and Tenant and enforceable by any court of competent
            jurisdiction. All appraisal fees and expenses of the Qualified
            Appraiser selected by Landlord shall be paid by Landlord, of the
            Qualified Appraiser selected by Tenant shall be paid by Tenant, and
            of the Third Appraiser shall be paid equally by Landlord and Tenant.

            Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Fair Market Rental as
            determined by the Third Appraiser pursuant to the foregoing
            procedures is greater than the lowest proposal of Landlord during
            the negotiation period, the Tenant shall pay one hundred percent
            (100%) of the fees and expenses of both Qualified Appraisers and the
            Third Appraiser. However, if the Fair Market Rental as determined by
            the Third Appraiser pursuant to the foregoing procedures is lower
            than the highest proposal of Tenant during the negotiation period,
            the Landlord shall pay one hundred percent (100%) of the fees and
            expenses of both Qualified Appraisers and the Third Appraiser. If
            the Fair Market Rental as determined by the Third Appraiser pursuant
            to the foregoing procedures is between Landlord's lowest proposal
            during the negotiation period and Tenant's highest proposal during
            the negotiation period, each of the parties shall bear the fees and
            expenses of their respectively appointed Qualified Appraiser and
            shall split the fees and expenses of the Third Appraiser.

      29.   RIGHT OF ENTRY. Provided that Landlord has given Tenant at least
            twenty-four (24) hours prior notice (except in the event of an
            emergency in which case no advance notice is required), and subject
            to reasonable security precautions of Tenant, Landlord may, at all
            reasonable times and during usual business hours, enter upon the
            Leased Premises for the purpose of inspecting, repairing or
            preserving the same, or to show the Leased Premises to prospective
            purchasers, and in addition may, at any time within the last
            eighteen (18) months of the then running Lease Term show the Leased
            Premises to prospective tenants. Any entry into the Leased Premises
            obtained by Landlord in accordance with this Section 29 shall not be
            deemed to be a forcible or unlawful entry into, or a detainer of,
            the Leased Premises, or an eviction, actual or constructive, of
            Tenant from the Leased Premises. Tenant hereby waives any claims for
            damages for any injury or inconvenience to or interference with
            Tenant's business, any loss of occupancy or quiet enjoyment of the
            Leased Premises, and any other loss occasioned thereby.

      30.   NOTICES. All notices and other communications to be given hereunder
            by Landlord or Tenant shall be in writing and shall be deemed to
            have been given upon (i) personal delivery when personally
            delivered; (ii) upon the earlier of receipt or the third Business
            Day following the date of deposit in the mail (at the addresses

            attention notice is directed at such address) after having been
            mailed by first class registered or certified mail, return receipt
            requested, postage prepaid; (iii) the next business day when sent

            The parties hereto may change the address for delivery by providing
            ten (10) days written notice to the other parties in the manner set
            forth herein. The copies of notices sent to Frank H. Maiorana and
            Robert C. Bates are informational and are not required in order for
            the notices given to Landlord and Tenant to be effective.

      31.   SURRENDER. Upon the expiration of the Lease Term, or upon the
            earlier termination of this Lease, Tenant shall vacate and surrender
            the Leased Premises to Landlord in first class condition and repair
            and in full compliance with the maintenance, repair and replacement
            provisions of this Lease. In any event, Tenant shall cause the
            following to be done prior to the expiration or the sooner
            termination of this Lease:

            a.    all interior walls shall be painted or cleaned so that they
                  appear freshly painted;

            b.    all non-carpeted floor coverings shall be cleaned and waxed to
                  the extent they are in first class condition;

            c.    to the extent non-carpeted floor coverings are not in first
                  class condition, said floor coverings shall be repaired or
                  replaced, as necessary;

            d.    all carpets not in first class condition shall be cleaned and
                  shampooed to the extent necessary to place them in first class
                  condition as reasonably determined by Landlord;

            e.    to the extent cleaning and shampooing does not place the
                  carpets in first class condition as reasonably determined by
                  Landlord, such carpets shall be replaced, to the extent
                  necessary, with neutral carpets of equal or better quality;

            f.    all broken, marred, stained or nonconforming acoustical
                  ceiling tiles shall be replaced; and

            g.    all windows shall be washed.

            If Landlord so requests, Tenant shall, prior to the expiration or
            sooner termination of this Lease, remove any Alterations which
            Tenant is required to remove pursuant to Section 11 and repair
            all damage caused by such removal.

                                  Page 34 of 42
<PAGE>
            If the Leased Premises are not so surrendered upon the expiration or
            sooner termination of this Lease, Tenant shall be liable to Landlord
            for all costs incurred by Landlord in conforming the Leased Premises
            to the required condition, plus interest on all such costs at the
            Default Rate. Tenant shall indemnify Landlord against loss or
            liability to the extent resulting from delay by Tenant in so
            surrendering the Leased Premises, including, without limitation, any
            claims made by any succeeding tenant to the extent related to such
            delay.

      32.   NO BROKER. Landlord and Tenant each represents to the other that
            there are no broker's commissions in connection with this Lease and
            each party shall indemnify, defend, protect and hold the other
            harmless from and against any and all Costs and Expenses related to
            a claim of commission owing by and through the applicable party.

      33.   WAIVER. Any waiver by Landlord of any Default, breach or failure by
            Tenant shall not constitute a waiver of any other Default, breach or
            failure by Tenant hereunder. The subsequent acceptance of Base Rent,
            Rent or Additional Charges hereunder by Landlord shall not be deemed
            to be a waiver of any preceding Default or breach by Tenant of this
            Lease, other than a failure of Tenant to pay the particular Base
            Rent, Rent or Additional Charges so accepted. No covenant, term or
            condition of this Lease shall be deemed to have been waived by
            Landlord unless such waiver be in writing by Landlord.

      34.   NO PARTNERSHIP. The relationship of the parties hereto as solely
            that of landlord and tenant, and under no circumstances shall the
            parties hereto be considered as partners, joint venturers or lender
            and borrower. Tenant represents, warrants and acknowledges that the
            transaction by which the Landlord acquired title to the Leased
            Premises and the subsequent lease of the Leased Premises hereunder
            are separate and distinct transactions and the Tenant has no rights
            of first refusal or options to purchase the Leased Premises.

      35.   PARTIAL INVALIDITY. The invalidity or unenforceability of any
            covenant, term or condition of this Lease shall not affect any other
            covenant, term or condition of this Lease.

      36.   RECORDING. Neither Landlord nor Tenant shall record this Lease
            without the prior written consent of the other, which consent may be
            withheld in the other party's sole and absolute discretion. Either
            party, however, may record a memorandum hereof and, in the event of
            a request to execute such memorandum by one party, the other party
            shall execute and deliver to the requesting party within ten (10)
            days after the request therefor, such memorandum to be in a form
            reasonably acceptable to both parties. If either party requests a
            memorandum of this Lease be executed and recorded, concurrently with
            the execution and delivery of said memorandum, Tenant shall execute
            and deliver to Landlord a Quitclaim Deed in such form and content as
            Landlord shall require. Such Quitclaim Deed shall be held by
            Landlord unrecorded unless and until this Lease has expired or been
            terminated. Tenant hereby irrevocably authorizes and directs
            Landlord to record said Quitclaim Deed upon the expiration or
            earlier termination of this Lease; provided, however, Landlord shall
            provide Tenant with notice of Landlord's intent to record the
            Quitclaim Deed at least five (5) business days prior to such
            recording.

      37.   HAZARDOUS MATERIALS. Landlord and Tenant agree as follows with
            respect to the existence or use of Hazardous Materials in, on or
            about the Leased Premises:

            a.    Except as otherwise permitted pursuant to Section 37(c) below,
                  any handling, transportation, storage, treatment, disposal or
                  use of Hazardous Materials by Tenant and Tenant's agents,
                  employees, contractors, or invitees (collectively "AGENTS")
                  after the

                                  Page 35 of 42
<PAGE>
                  Effective Date in or about the Leased Premises is strictly
                  prohibited. Tenant shall indemnify, defend upon demand with
                  counsel reasonably acceptable to Landlord and hold harmless
                  Landlord from and against any liabilities, losses, claims,
                  damages, lost profits, consequential damages, interest,
                  penalties, fines, monetary sanctions, attorneys' fees,
                  experts' fees, court costs, remediation costs, investigation
                  costs, and other expenses which result from or arise in any
                  manner whatsoever out of the use, storage, treatment,
                  transportation, release, or disposal of any Hazardous
                  Materials on or about the Leased Premises caused or permitted
                  by Tenant or Tenant's Agents.

            b.    If the presence of Hazardous Materials in, on or about the
                  Leased Premises caused or permitted by Tenant or Tenant's
                  Agents results in contamination or deterioration of water or
                  soil resulting in a level of contamination greater than the
                  levels established as acceptable by any governmental agency
                  having jurisdiction over such contamination, then Tenant shall
                  promptly take any and all action necessary to investigate and
                  remediate such contamination if required by Law or as a
                  condition to the issuance or continuing effectiveness of any
                  governmental approval which relates to the use of me Leased
                  Premises or any part thereof.

            c.    Landlord acknowledges that Tenant uses numerous chemicals
                  classified as Hazardous Materials in the operation of its
                  business and that Tenant shall be permitted to do so provided
                  that Tenant does so in a manner consistent with the
                  requirements of this Section 37(c) and provided that Tenant
                  discloses the use of such materials to Landlord as required by
                  Section 37(k). In addition, Tenant may use reasonable
                  quantities of household chemicals such as adhesives,
                  lubricants and cleaning fluids in order to conduct its
                  business at the Leased Premises. Tenant agrees that during its
                  use and occupancy of the Leased Premises it will: (1) not (A)
                  permit Hazardous Materials to be present on or about the
                  Leased Premises except in a manner and quantity necessary for
                  the ordinary performance of Tenant's business or (B) release,
                  discharge or dispose of any Hazardous Materials on, in, at,
                  under, or emanating from, the Leased Premises; (2) comply with
                  all Hazardous Materials Laws relating to the Leased Premises
                  and the use of Hazardous Materials on or about the Leased
                  Premises and not engage in or permit others to engage in any
                  activity at the Leased Premises in violation of any Hazardous
                  Materials Laws; and (3) immediately notify Landlord of (A) any
                  inquiry, test, investigation or enforcement proceeding by any
                  governmental agency or authority against Tenant, Landlord or
                  the Leased Premises relating to any Hazardous Materials or
                  under any Hazardous Materials Laws; (B) any contamination of
                  the Leased Premises by Hazardous Materials which constitutes a
                  violation of any Hazardous Materials Laws; or (C) the
                  occurrence of any event or existence of any condition that
                  would cause a breach of any of the covenants set forth in this
                  Section 37.

            d.    Upon reasonable notice to Tenant, Landlord may inspect the
                  Leased Premises and surrounding areas for the purpose of
                  determining whether there exists on or about the Leased
                  Premises any Hazardous Material or other condition or activity
                  that is in violation of the requirements of this Lease or of
                  any Hazardous Materials Laws. Such inspections may include,
                  but are not limited to, entering the Leased Premises or
                  adjacent property with drill rigs or other machinery for the
                  purpose of obtaining laboratory samples. Landlord shall not be
                  limited in the number of such inspections during the Lease
                  Term. In the event (i) such inspections reveal the presence of
                  any such Hazardous Material or other condition or activity in
                  violation of the requirements of this Lease or of any
                  Hazardous Materials Laws, or (ii) Tenant or its Agents
                  contribute or knowingly consent to the presence of any
                  Hazardous Materials in, on, under, through or about the Leased

                                  Page 36 of 42
<PAGE>
                  Premises or exacerbate the condition of or the conditions
                  caused by any Hazardous Materials in, on, under, through or
                  about the Leased Premises, Tenant shall reimburse Landlord for
                  the cost of such inspections within ten (10) days of receipt
                  of a written statement therefor. Tenant will supply to
                  Landlord such historical and operational information regarding
                  the Leased Premises and surrounding areas as may be reasonably
                  requested to facilitate any such inspection and will make
                  available for meetings appropriate personnel having knowledge
                  of such matters. Tenant agrees to give Landlord at least sixty
                  (60) days prior notice of its intention to vacate the Leased
                  Premises so that Landlord will have an opportunity to perform
                  such an inspection prior to such vacation. The right granted
                  to Landlord herein to perform inspections shall not create a
                  duty on Landlord's part to inspect the Leased Premises, or
                  liability on the part of Landlord for Tenant's use, storage,
                  manufacture, treatment or disposal of Hazardous Materials, it
                  being understood that Tenant shall be solely responsible for
                  all liability in connection with the use, storage,
                  manufacture, treatment or disposal of Hazardous Materials by
                  Tenant or Tenant's Agents.

                  Quality which regulates the use, storage, release or disposal
                  of any Hazardous Materials.

            f.    If Tenant's use of Hazardous Materials on or about the Leased
                  Premises results in a release, discharge or disposal of
                  Hazardous Materials on, in, at, under, or emanating from, the
                  Leased Premises, Tenant agrees to investigate, clean up,
                  remove or remediate such Hazardous Materials in full
                  compliance with: (i) the requirements of (A) all Hazardous
                  Materials Laws and (B) any governmental agency or authority
                  responsible for the enforcement of any Hazardous Materials
                  Laws; and (ii) any additional requirements of Landlord that
                  are reasonably necessary to protect the value of the Leased
                  Premises.

            g.    Landlord shall have the right, but not the obligation, prior
                  or subsequent to Tenant's Default, without in any way limiting
                  Landlord's other rights and remedies under this Lease, to
                  enter upon the Leased Premises, or to take such other actions
                  as it deems reasonably necessary or advisable, to investigate,
                  clean up, remove or remediate any Hazardous Materials or
                  contamination by Hazardous Materials present on, in, at,
                  under,

                                  Page 37 of 42
<PAGE>
                  or emanating from, the Leased Premises in violation of
                  Tenant's obligations under this Lease or under any Hazardous
                  Materials Laws. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
                  Lease, Landlord shall also have the right, at its election, in
                  its own name or as Tenant's agent, to negotiate, defend,
                  approve and appeal, at Tenant's expense, any action taken or
                  order issued by any governmental agency or authority with
                  regard to any such Hazardous Materials or contamination by
                  Hazardous Materials. The reasonable Costs and Expenses paid or
                  incurred by Landlord in the exercise of the rights set forth
                  in this Section 37 shall be payable by Tenant upon demand.

            h.    Notwithstanding any provision contained herein to the
                  contrary, Tenant shall surrender the Leased Premises to
                  Landlord upon the expiration or earlier termination of this
                  Lease free of debris, waste or Hazardous Materials placed on,
                  about or near the Leased Premises by Tenant or Tenant's
                  Agents, and, with respect to any contamination or other
                  conditions resulting from the actions or inaction of Tenant or
                  Tenant's Agents, in a condition which complies with all
                  Hazardous Materials Laws and any additional requirements of
                  Landlord that are reasonably necessary to protect the value of
                  the Leased Premises, including, without limitation, the
                  obtaining of any closure permits or other governmental permits
                  or approvals related to Tenant's use of Hazardous Materials in
                  or about the Leased Premises. If it is determined by Landlord
                  that the condition of all or any portion of the Leased
                  Premises is not in compliance with the provisions of this
                  Lease with respect to Hazardous Materials, including, without
                  limitation, all Hazardous Materials Laws, at the expiration or
                  earlier termination of this Lease, then at Landlord's sole
                  option, Landlord may require Tenant to hold over possession of
                  the Leased Premises until Tenant can surrender the Leased
                  Premises to Landlord in the condition in which the Leased
                  Premises existed on the Effective Date and in any case prior
                  to the appearance of such Hazardous Materials, including,
                  without limitation, the conduct or performance of any closures
                  as required by any Hazardous Materials Laws. Any such holdover
                  by Tenant will be with Landlord's consent, will not be
                  terminable by Tenant in any event or circumstance and will
                  otherwise be subject to the provisions of Section 38 of this
                  Lease.

            i.    Tenant agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Landlord from and
                  against any and all claims, losses (including, without
                  limitation, loss in value of the Leased Premises), liabilities
                  and expenses (including attorneys' fees) sustained by Landlord
                  attributable to (i) any Hazardous Materials placed on or about
                  the Leased Premises by Tenant or Tenant's Agents, or (ii)
                  Tenant's breach of any provision of this Section 37.

            j.    The obligations of Tenant under this Section 37 shall survive
                  the expiration or earlier termination of the Lease Term. The
                  rights and obligations of Landlord and Tenant with respect to
                  issues relating to Hazardous Materials are exclusively
                  established by this Section 37. In the event of any
                  inconsistency between any other part of this Lease and this
                  Section 37, the terms of this Section 37 shall control.

            k.    Prior to the execution of this Lease, Tenant has completed,
                  executed and delivered to Landlord a Hazardous Materials
                  Disclosure Certificate ("CERTIFICATE") in form and content
                  attached hereto as Exhibit C. Tenant covenants, represents and
                  warrants to Landlord that the information in the Certificate
                  is true and correct and accurately describes the Hazardous
                  Materials that will be manufactured, treated, used or stored
                  on or about the Leased Premises by Tenant or Tenant's Agents.
                  Tenant shall (a) on each six (6) month anniversary of the
                  commencement date of this Lease; and (b) at such other times
                  as Landlord reasonably requests, complete, execute and deliver
                  to Landlord an updated Hazardous Materials Disclosure
                  Certificate (each, an "UPDATED CERTIFICATE") describing

                                  Page 38 of 42
<PAGE>
                  Tenant's then current and known proposed future uses of
                  Hazardous Materials on or about the Leased Premises, which
                  Updated Certificates shall be in the same format as that which
                  is set forth in Exhibit C or in such updated format as
                  Landlord may reasonably require from time to time. Landlord
                  shall have the right to approve or disapprove such new or
                  additional Hazardous Materials in its sole and absolute
                  discretion; provided, however, that this requirement shall not
                  apply to Hazardous Materials manufactured, treated, used or
                  stored by Tenant in connection with Tenant's business, which
                  Hazardous Materials may be used in accordance with this
                  Section 37. Tenant shall make no use of Hazardous Materials on
                  or about the Leased Premises except as described in the
                  Certificate, an Updated Certificate or as otherwise approved
                  by Landlord in writing in accordance with this Section 37;
                  provided, however, that Landlord shall have no right to
                  approve or disapprove of Hazardous Materials manufactured,
                  treated, used or stored by Tenant in connection with Tenant's
                  business, which Hazardous Materials may be used in accordance
                  with this Section 37; provided further, however, that Tenant
                  shall not be required to provide Landlord prior notice of a
                  new or different chemical which is classified as a Hazardous
                  Material which is used in connection with Tenant's business.
                  The Certificate and each Updated Certificate shall be
                  completed and signed by Tenant's environmental risk manager.

      38.   HOLDING OVER. No holding over by Tenant of the Leased Premises after
            the expiration of the Lease Term shall operate to extend the Lease
            Term or this Lease, and Tenant shall indemnify, defend and hold
            Landlord harmless from all Costs and Expenses and claims for damages
            by any other tenant to whom Landlord may have leased to Leased
            Premises effective upon the expiration of the Lease Term or
            termination of this Lease. Any such holding over shall be deemed a
            tenancy at sufferance, subject to all conditions, provisions and
            obligations of this Lease insofar as the same are applicable to a
            tenancy at sufferance, except that the Base Rent shall be an amount
            equal to one hundred ten percent (110%) of the greater of (i) Base
            Rent that was applicable at the expiration of the Lease; and (ii)
            the fair market rental value as reasonably determined by Landlord.

      39.   AUTHORITY. The person or persons executing this Lease on behalf of
            Landlord and Tenant each hereby represent and warrant to the other
            party (Landlord or Tenant, as the case may be) that authority for
            the same was duly given as evidenced by the certified copy of
            resolution(s) of their respective Boards of Directors.

      40.   PARKING. Tenant, its officers, directors, employees, agents,
            contractors, vendors, licensees and other authorized persons, shall
            be entitled to use throughout the Lease Term all vehicular parking
            spaces, free of charge on and about the Leased Premises.

      41.   QUIET TITLE. Provided that Tenant is not in Default under this
            Lease, Landlord covenants that, subject to the terms and conditions
            of this Lease, from and after the commencement of the Lease Term,
            Tenant shall not be disturbed or hindered in Tenant's enjoyment of
            the Leased Premises and that Landlord shall not interfere with
            Tenant's business activities involving the Leased Premises.

      42.   BENEFIT. The covenants, terms and conditions of this Lease shall
            inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and,
            subject to Section 23, their respective successors and assigns.

      43.   SIGNAGE. Tenant shall be permitted to place such signage on and
            about the Leased Premises as are permitted by applicable law;
            provided, however, prior to the expiration or

                                  Page 39 of 42
<PAGE>
            earlier termination of this Lease, Tenant shall remove such signage
            from the Leased Premises and restore the Leased Premises to its
            condition immediately preceding the installation of such signage.

      44.   TELECOMMUNICATIONS. Tenant's use of the Leased Premises shall not
            include using the Leased Premises to provide telecommunications
            services (including, without limitation, Internet connections) to
            third parties, it being intended that Tenant's telecommunications
            activities within the Leased Premises be strictly limited to such
            activities as are incidental to general office use.

      45.   APPROVALS AND CONSENTS. Unless a party's sole discretion is
            otherwise expressly provided for in a particular provision of this
            Lease, all approvals and consents required of either party hereunder
            shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, regardless of whether
            or not the provision in question expressly so states.

      46.   SECURITY DEPOSIT. Concurrently herewith, Tenant shall deposit with
            Landlord the sum of Six Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars
            ($650,000.00), as security for the performance by Tenant of its
            obligations under this Lease, and not as prepayment of Rent (the
            "SECURITY DEPOSIT"). Landlord may from time to time apply such
            portion of the Security Deposit as is necessary for the following
            purposes:

            a.    to remedy any default by Tenant in the payment of Rent;

            b.    to repair damage to the Leased Premises caused by Tenant;

            c.    to clean the Leased Premises upon the expiration or sooner
                  termination of the Lease; and/or

            d.    to remedy any other default of Tenant to the extent permitted
                  by applicable law, including, without limitation, on account
                  of damages owing to Landlord under Section 24(b), and, in this
                  regard, Tenant hereby waives any restriction on the uses to
                  which the Security Deposit may be put, if any.

            In the event the Security Deposit or any portion thereof is so used,
            Tenant agrees to pay to Landlord promptly upon demand an amount in
            cash sufficient to restore the Security Deposit to the full original
            amount. Landlord shall not be deemed a trustee of the Security
            Deposit, may use the Security Deposit in business, and shall not be
            required to segregate it from its general accounts. Tenant shall not
            be entitled to any interest on the Security Deposit. If Landlord
            transfers the Leased Premises during the Lease Term, Landlord shall
            pay the Security Deposit to any transferee of Landlord's interest,
            in which event the transferring Landlord will be released from all
            liability for the return of the Security Deposit. If Tenant performs
            every provision of this Lease to be performed by Tenant, the unused
            portion of the Security Deposit shall be returned to Tenant (or, at
            Tenant's direction, the last assignee of Tenant's interest under
            this Lease), to the extent not applied, within fifteen (15) days
            following the expiration or sooner termination of this Lease and the
            surrender of the Leased Premises by Tenant to Landlord in accordance
