(p) to read as follows:

          (p) The Company is, individually and together with its Subsidiaries,
     Solvent. "Solvent" means, with respect to any Person on a particular date,
     that on such date (i) the fair value of the property of such Person is
     greater than the total amount of liabilities, including, without
     limitation, contingent liabilities, of such Person, (ii) the present fair
     salable value of the assets of such Person is not less than the amount that
     will be required to pay the probable liability of such Person on its debts
     as they become absolute and matured, (iii) such Person does not intend to,
     and does not believe that it will, incur debts or liabilities beyond such
     Person's ability to pay such debts and liabilities as they mature and (iv)
     such Person is not engaged in business or a transaction, and is not about
     to engage in business or a transaction, for which such Person's property
     would constitute an unreasonably small capital. The amount of contingent
     liabilities at any time shall be computed as the amount that, in the light
     of all the facts and circumstances existing at such time, represents the
     amount that can reasonably be expected to become an actual or matured
     liability.

     (e) Section 5.01(i)(xi) is amended by (i) deleting the reference "Section
5.03(c)" and substituting therefor the reference "Section 5.03" and (ii)
deleting the punctuation "." at the end thereof and substituting therefor the
punctuation ";" and adding a new clause (xii) to read as follows:

          (xii) as soon as available and in any event within 30 days after the
     end of each calendar month other than December, and within 45 days after

     commencing at the end of the previous fiscal year and ending with the end
     of such month.

     (f) Section 5.02(b) is amended by deleting the phrase "except that any
Subsidiary of the Company may merge or consolidate with or into, or dispose of
assets to, any other Subsidiary of the Company" and substituting therefor the
phrase "except that any Subsidiary Guarantor may merge or consolidate with or
into, or dispose of assets to, any other Subsidiary Guarantor and any Subsidiary
(other than a Subsidiary Guarantor) may merge or consolidate with or into, or
dispose of assets to, any other Subsidiary of the Company".

     (g) Section 5.02(f) is amended (i) by adding to the end of clause (i) a
proviso to read "provided, that additional investment in wholly owned
Subsidiaries organized outside of the United States shall be made only by other
Subsidiaries organized outside of the United States for the period from January
1, 2003 through June 30, 2003" and (ii) clause (iv) is amended by deleting the
phrase "acquisitions of Techmer, PM, LLC and SoFteR S.p.a. for an aggregate
amount not to exceed $37,000,000" and substituting therefor the phrase "the
contribution of up to $10,000,000 to a joint venture to consist of the
polyurethane system businesses of the Company and Bayer Corporation".

     (h) Section 5.02(g) is amended (i) by deleting the phrase "At any time
after December 31, 2001 that the Borrowed Debt/EBITDA Ratio is greater than or
equal to 4.00:1 and until the Borrowed Debt/EBITDA Ratio is less than or equal
to 3.50:1 for two consecutive fiscal quarters," and (ii) by deleting clauses

     plus Investments permitted pursuant to Section 5.02(f)(iv), provided that
     the aggregate amount of Capital Expenditures made during the period from
     January 1, 2003 through June 30, 2003 shall not exceed $25,000,000.
