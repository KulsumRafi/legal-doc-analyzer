INC., a New York corporation (the &#147;Company&#148;), the Lenders signing

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>RECITALS</FONT></H1>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       Pursuant to that certain Revolving Credit Agreement dated as of December 17, 2001 by and
among the Company, the Lenders from time to time party thereto, the Managing Administrative Agent, the
Administrative Agents, the Co-Syndication Agents, the Documentation Agent, and the Other Facility Agents (as
amended, extended and replaced from time to time, the "Credit Agreement," and with capitalized terms used
herein and not otherwise defined used with the meanings given such terms in the Credit Agreement), the Short
Term Lenders currently party to the Credit Agreement (the "Existing Short Term Lenders") agreed to extend
credit on a short-term basis to the Company on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       The Short Term Lenders signing below have agreed to extend the Short Term Facility Maturity
Date on the terms and conditions set forth below.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       In addition, the Lenders (including both the Short Term Lender and the Multi-Year Lenders)
have agreed to amend the Credit Agreement in certain respects.
</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW,
THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing Recitals and for other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby
acknowledged, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows: </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
                                                       AGREEMENT
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
       <U>Extension of Short Term Facility Maturity Date</U>.  To reflect the agreement of the Company
and those Short Term Lenders signing this Amendment to extend the Short Term Facility Maturity Date,
effective as of the Effective Date (as defined in Paragraph 7 below), the definition of the term "Short Term
Facility Maturity Date" set forth in the Glossary to the Credit Agreement is hereby amended by deleting the
date "December 16, 2002" set forth therein and replacing the same with the date "December 15, 2003."
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
       <U>Addition of New Lenders</U>.  To reflect the fact that certain financial institutions which are
not currently Short Term Lenders may desire to become Short Term Lenders under the Credit Agreement, any such
financial institution signing below as an "Applicant Financial Institution" (and defined herein as such)
shall become a "Short Term Lender" under the Credit Agreement as of the Effective Date, and shall be deemed
approved by each of the Company and the Managing Administrative Agent pursuant to Paragraph 14(a) of the
Credit Agreement, on the following terms and conditions:
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                  (a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Each such Applicant Financial Institution hereby acknowledges and agrees that from
and after the Effective Date it will be a "Short Term Lender" under the Credit Agreement and the other Credit
Documents with all the rights and benefits and with all the obligations of the Short Term Lenders thereunder.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                  (b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      On and after the Effective Date, the Maximum Short Term Facility Commitment and
Short Term Swing Line Commitment of each such Applicant Financial Institution shall be consistent with the
Commitment Schedule attached hereto as <U>Annex 1</U> (the "Replacement Commitment Schedule") and, if necessary,
each such Applicant Financial Institution hereby agrees to purchase on the Effective Date and to accept the
assignment and transfer of a portion of the Maximum Short Term Facility Commitments and, as applicable, the
Short Term Swingline Commitments held by the Existing Short Term Lenders consistent with the Replacement
Commitment Schedule.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                  (c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      The Managing Administrative Agent hereby waives:  (1) receipt of any Additional
Lender Agreement or Assignment Agreement that would otherwise be required to be executed and delivered by
such Applicant Financial Institution pursuant to Paragraph 14(a)(2)(iii) of the Credit Agreement, and (2) the
registration fee of $3,500.00 required to be delivered by each Applicant Financial Institution pursuant to
Paragraph 14(a)(2)(iv) of the Credit Agreement.
</FONT></P>


<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
       <U>Reallocation of Commitments</U>.  Notwithstanding whether any Applicant Financial Institution
becomes a "Short Term Lender" under the Credit Agreement on the Effective Date pursuant to Paragraph 2 above,
no later than 12:30 p.m. (Los Angeles time) on the Effective Date, each Short Term Lender signing this
Amendment (including each Applicant Financial Institution, if any) will pay to the Managing Administrative
Agent any amount necessary to cause such Short Term Lender's Short Term Facility Percentage Share of Short
Term Loans outstanding and, as applicable, such Short Term Lender's Short Term Swing Line Percentage Share of
Short Term Swing Loans outstanding to be consistent with the Replacement Commitment Schedule, and the
Managing Administrative Agent shall thereupon remit to the Existing Short Term Lenders, as applicable, their
shares of such funds.  Fees and interest accrued with respect to Short Term Loans and Short Term Swing Loans
to but not including the Effective Date shall be payable to the Existing Short Term Lenders in accordance
with their respective Short Term Facility Percentage Shares and Short Term Swing Line Percentage Shares, as
appropriate, in effect prior to the Effective Date.
