               Loan to be made by the Seller to the Issuer on the Closing Date,
               shall be deposited by the Issuer to the Reserve Account pursuant
               to Section 2.7 and such amount shall be added to the Outstanding
               Amount of the Class D Notes issued to the Seller on the Closing
               Date.

         (c)   Subsequent Purchase Price. Each Subsequent Purchase Price shall
               be paid and satisfied as follows: (i) the amount equal to the
               Subsequent Purchase Price minus the Reserve Account Initial
               Deposit for the related Subsequent Transfer Date shall be paid by
               the Issuer to the Seller on the related Subsequent Transfer Date
               from the Pre-Funding Account pursuant to Section 5.8(b) in cash,
               by certified cheque or bank draft or by wire transfer in
               immediately available funds, in each case, payable to or to the
               order of the Seller and (ii) the balance, being the principal
               amount of the Subordinated Reserve Account Loan to be made by the
               Seller to the Issuer on the related Subsequent Transfer Date, and
               shall be deposited by the Issuer to the Reserve Account pursuant
               to Section 2.7.

         (d)   Payment of the Residual Purchase Price. The unpaid portion of the
               Residual Purchase Price shall be paid and satisfied on each
               Monthly Payment Date by the payment by the Issuer to the Seller
               of the Monthly Residual Purchase Price Amount, if any, for such
               Monthly Payment Date in cash or by wire transfer in immediately
               available funds to the Seller or by way of offset against the

               made by the Seller to the Issuer on such Monthly Payment Date in
               accordance with Section 2.7(d). For greater certainty, if the
               Seller is obligated to make a Subordinated Reserve Account Loan
               to the Issuer on any Monthly Payment Date pursuant to Section
               2.7(c), the payments the Issuer is obligated to make pursuant to
               this Section 2.4(d) shall be due and payable on such date but
               will not be paid unless and until the Seller makes such
               Subordinated Reserve Account Loan, and it is the intention of the
               parties that such payments by the Issuer under this Section
               2.4(d) shall be netted and set-off pursuant to Section 2.7(d)
               against the obligation of the Seller to make such Subordinated
               Reserve Account Loan to the Issuer.

               the beneficial interest in and title to the Receivables and such

2.7      SUBORDINATED RESERVE ACCOUNT LOAN.

         (a)   The Seller agrees to make interest bearing subordinated loans to

               Reserve Account Loan") on the Closing Date, on each Subsequent
               Transfer Date and on each Monthly Payment Date in accordance with
               the terms and provisions of this Agreement.

         (b)   On the Closing Date and on each Subsequent Transfer Date, the

               Issuer in a principal amount equal to 2.00% of the Principal
               Balance as of the related Cut-Off Date of the Receivables to be
               sold and transferred by the Seller to the Issuer on the Closing
               Date or Subsequent Transfer Date, as applicable. The Seller
               hereby irrevocably directs the Issuer to retain the principal
               amount of the Subordinated Reserve Account Loan for each such
               date from the cash portion of the Initial Purchase Price or
               Subsequent Purchase Price otherwise payable to the Seller on the
               Closing Date or Subsequent Transfer Date, as applicable. The
               Issuer shall deposit each Subordinated Reserve Account Loan to
               the Reserve Account on the Closing Date or related Subsequent
               Transfer Date.

         (c)   On each Monthly Payment Date following the Closing Date, the
               Seller shall make an additional Subordinated Reserve Account Loan
               to the Issuer in a principal amount equal to the sum of:

               (i)    the lesser of (A) the Monthly Residual Purchase Price
                      Amount for such Monthly Payment Date and (B) the excess,
                      if any, of (1) the Principal Balance of all Receivables
                      that became Liquidated Receivables during the preceding
                      Collection Period over (2) the Principal Balance of all
                      Liquidated Receivables for the preceding Collection Period
                      described in clauses (ii) and (iv) of the definition of
                      Liquidated Receivables;

               (ii)   the lesser of (A) the excess, if any, of the amount
                      determined under clause (i)(A) above over the amount, if
                      any, determined under clause (i)(B) above, and (B) the
                      Reserve Account Deposit Amount, if any, for such Monthly
                      Payment Date; and

               (iii)  the lesser of (A) the excess, if any, of the amount
                      determined under clause (ii)(A) above over the amount, if
                      any, determined under clause (ii)(B) above, and (B) the
                      Accelerated Principal Payment Amount for such Monthly
                      Payment Date.

         (d)   The amount of each Subordinated Reserve Account Loan to be
               advanced by the Seller to the Issuer on any Monthly Payment Date
               shall be set off and netted against the Monthly Residual Purchase
               Price Amount and the accrued and unpaid interest on the
               Subordinated Reserve Account Loan for such Monthly Payment Date
               otherwise payable by the Issuer to the Seller on such date. The
               Issuer shall retain in the Reserve Account the amount of the
               Subordinated Reserve Account Loan due from the Seller to the
               Issuer on such Monthly Payment Date from the funds on deposit in
               the Reserve Account that would otherwise be available to pay the
               Monthly Residual Purchase Price Amount and the accrued and unpaid
               interest on the Subordinated Reserve Account Loan due to the
               Seller on such Monthly Payment Date in full satisfaction, to the
               extent of the amount of such Subordinated Reserve Account Loan,
               of the Issuer's obligation to pay such Monthly Residual Purchase
               Price Amount and such accrued and unpaid interest. On any Monthly
               Payment Date, such setoff and netting shall be made, first,
               against the Monthly Residual Purchase Price Amount due and
               payable by the Issuer to the extent thereof pursuant to Section
               2.4(d), and second, against the accrued and unpaid interest on
               the Subordinated Reserve Account Loan otherwise due and payable
               by the Issuer pursuant to Section 5.6(c)(xiv), in each case, to
               the extent of the Subordinated Reserve Account Loan due and
               payable by the Seller to the Issuer on such Monthly Payment Date.

         (e)   The outstanding principal balance of the Subordinated Reserve
               Account Loan (the "Subordinated Reserve Account Loan Balance")
               shall bear interest at the rate of 15% per annum calculated on
               the Subordinated Reserve Account Loan Balance as of the close of
               the immediately preceding Monthly Payment Date (or the Closing
               Date in the case of the initial Monthly Payment Date) on the
               basis of a 365 day year for the actual number of days elapsed.
               Accrued and unpaid interest on the Subordinated Reserve Account
               Loan (including interest on overdue interest at the same rate)
               shall be due and payable on each Monthly Payment Date to the
               extent of the funds on deposit in the Reserve Account which are
               available for release to the Seller for the payment of such
               interest as herein provided.

         (f)   The Seller's recourse for payment of the Subordinated Reserve
               Account Loan and any interest accrued and unpaid thereon
               (including interest on overdue interest) and the Residual
               Purchase Price shall be limited to the amounts which are
               available from time to time (subject to Sections 2.4(d) and
               2.7(d), as applicable) to be released to the Seller pursuant to
               and in accordance with clauses (xi), (xiii) and (xiv) of Section
               5.6(c) and Sections 5.7 and 5.9 of this Agreement or Section 3.2

               interest on the Subordinated Reserve Account Loan or the Residual
               Purchase Price (in each case, after all deposits, withdrawals or
               payments to or for the benefit of the Series C2002-1 Debtholders
               and the other Related Specified Creditors to be made thereunder
               in accordance with this Agreement and the other Basic Documents).
               The Seller hereby subordinates payment or repayment of the
               Subordinated Reserve Account Loan and the Residual Purchase Price
               to the prior payment in full of the Series C2002-1 Notes and the
               debts, liabilities and obligations of the Issuer to the other
               Related Specified Creditors. The Seller acknowledges and agrees
               that the Subordinated Reserve Account Loan and the Residual
               Purchase

               15.3, 15.4 and 15.5 of the Indenture and the Series Supplement
               and is otherwise a Related Obligation for and of the Series
               C2002-1 Notes for the purposes of the Indenture. The Seller
               hereby irrevocably waives and agrees not to assert, claim or
               endeavour to exercise, and irrevocably bars and estops itself
               from asserting, claiming or exercising, any security interest,
               right of set-off, right or other purported form of claim with
               respect to or in any of the monies, funds or other property of
               the Issuer (including Collections on the Receivables) which may
               now or hereafter be in the possession of or under the control of
               the Seller (in its capacity a Seller or Servicer), it being
               acknowledged and agreed that the Seller's only recourse for
               payment of amounts now or hereafter due or owing by the Issuer to
               the Seller shall be as set forth above in this Section.

         (g)   None of the Issuer, the Trustee or the Indenture Trustee shall
               have any personal liability to the Seller to pay or repay the
               Subordinated Reserve Account Loan or any accrued and unpaid
               interest thereon nor shall the Seller have recourse to any
               Related Collateral for payment of the Subordinated Reserve
               Account Loan other than amounts on deposit in or credited to the
               Reserve Account from time to time and available for payment of
               the Subordinated Reserve Account Loan and accrued and unpaid
               interest thereon in accordance with the terms and provisions of

2.8      CLASS VPN LOANS; ADDITIONAL CLASS VPN LOANS.

         (a)   On or before the Closing Date, the Issuer will enter into the
               Initial Class VPN Loan Agreement with the Initial Class VPN
               Lender and will obtain the Initial Class VPN Loan on the Closing
               Date. The Issuer may obtain additional Class VPN Loans (i) on the
               Business Day preceding any Targeted Final Payment Date for each
               Class of Class A Notes, (ii) on any Class A Note Payment Date for
               a Class during a Sequential Amortization Period, or (iii) on the
               Business Day preceding any such date. Pursuant to the Initial
               Class VPN Loan Agreement, the Issuer may (a) on the Closing Date
               obtain the Initial Class VPN Loan to fund the payment of a
               portion of the Initial Purchase Price, (b) on any Targeted Final
               Payment Date or the Business Day preceding such date obtain
               additional Class VPN Loans to repay maturing Class A Notes having
               that Targeted Final Payment Date as their Targeted Final Payment
               Date, and (c) on any Class A Note Payment Date during a
               Sequential Amortization Period or the Determination Date
               preceding such date obtain additional Class VPN Loans to repay
               any Class of outstanding Class A Notes which was not paid in full
               on its Targeted Final Payment Date. Under the Initial Class VPN
               Loan Agreement, Class VPN Loans will be advanced to the Issuer on
               the Business Day preceding each Targeted Final Payment Date.

         (b)   The Initial Class VPN Loan will bear interest at an annual rate
               (the "Interest Rate" for such Class VPN Loans) equal to the BA 1
               Month Rate plus 0.59%, subject to adjustment to a fixed rate as
               described in the definition of Interest Rate. Additional Class
               VPN Loans obtained after the Closing Date will have an Interest
               Rate equal to the BA 1 Month Rate plus a margin; provided,
               however, that in no

<PAGE>

                                       11

               event will such margin over the BA 1 Month Rate exceed 1.50%,
               subject to adjustment to a fixed rate as described in the
               definition of Interest Rate. The Interest Rate for any Class VPN
               Loan made after the Closing Date will be determined at the time
               of advance of such Class VPN Loan and will reflect then current
               market conditions.

         (c)   Subject to Section 2.8(d), the Servicer agrees to request
               advances of Class VPN Loans that may be obtained for any Class A
               Note Payment Date on which Class VPN Loans may be obtained from
               the Initial Class A Lender and, if such Initial Class VPN Lender
               does not advance such Class VPN Loans in accordance with the
               terms of the Initial Class VPN Loan Agreement, then, subject to
               the Initial Class VPN Loan Agreement, the Issuer may enter into
               additional committed or uncommitted Class VPN Loan Agreements
               with additional Class VPN Lenders pursuant to which the Issuer
               may obtain additional Class VPN Loans. In each case, the
               aggregate principal amount of the Class VPN Loans to be requested
               by the Servicer in respect of any Class A Note Payment Date on
               which Class VPN Loans may be obtained will be such that (i) the
               Total Noteholders' Principal Payment Amount for a Targeted Final
               Payment Date (except during a Sequential Amortization Period) or
               (ii) the requested Class VPN Loan Proceeds, together with the
               Aggregate Principal Distributable Amount for such Monthly Payment
               Date, the Accelerated Principal Payment Amount, if any, for such
               Monthly Payment Date, and the Accumulation Amount, if any, for
               such Monthly Payment Date, will be sufficient to pay the
               applicable Class of Class A Notes in full on such Class A Note
               Payment Date. Neither the Seller nor the Servicer shall be liable
               to the Issuer for any failure to identify any other prospective
               Class VPN Lenders to make Class VPN Loans or to obtain any Class
               VPN Loans on any Determination Date or for any Class A Note
               Payment Date.

         (d)   No Class VPN Loans shall be requested by the Servicer or be
               obtained by the Issuer for any Monthly Payment Date on which
               Class VPN Loans may be obtained by the Issuer unless the
               following conditions are satisfied:

               (i)    after giving effect to the advance of such Class VPN Loans
                      and all payments of principal on the Series C2002-1 Debt
                      Obligations on that Monthly Payment Date (including the
                      application of any Class VPN Loan Proceeds on such date),
                      the sum of the Outstanding Amount of the Series C2002-1
                      Debt Obligations shall not exceed the Pool Balance of the
                      Receivables on the last day of the Collection Period
                      immediately preceding that Monthly Payment Date;

               (ii)   the Class VPN Swap shall be in full force and effect and
                      no Early Termination Date shall have occurred thereunder;
                      and

               (iii)  no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing.

         (e)   With respect to each Class VPN Loan Agreement and each Class VPN
               Loan entered into or obtained after the Closing Date, the
               Servicer shall provide the Rating Agencies with written notice of
               the entering into, and a true copy of, such

<PAGE>

                                       12

               Class VPN Loan Agreement, together with the Interest Rate
               applicable to such Class VPN Loan.

2.9      LIQUIDITY ADVANCES; MATURITY ADVANCES.

         (a)   If:

               (i)    on any Class A Note Payment Date for the Class A-1 Notes
                      or Class A-2 Notes, the Issuer has a binding agreement for
                      the advance of a Class VPN Loan but the Servicer
                      determines that the proceeds from that advance will not be
                      received on that date in time to make payments on the
                      Class A Notes of that Class on that date, the Servicer
                      may, in its sole discretion, make an advance (each, a
                      "Liquidity Advance") to the Issuer in an amount equal to
                      those anticipated proceeds if it determines, in its sole
                      discretion, that it has received reasonable assurances
                      from the prospective lender of the Class VPN Loan to the
                      effect that the full amount of the proceeds will be
                      delivered to the Issuer later on that date or within two
                      Business Days thereafter; or

               (ii)   on any Targeted Final Payment Date for the Class B Notes
                      or Class C Notes, the amount on deposit in the Note
                      Distribution Account on such date available for payment of
                      principal on the applicable Class is less than the
                      outstanding principal amount of that Class, the Servicer
                      will have the option to make an advance (each, a "Maturity
                      Advance") on that date in an amount up to the amount of
                      such shortfall.

         (b)   If the Servicer makes a Liquidity Advance or a Maturity Advance,
               the proceeds thereof will be deposited into the Note Distribution
               Account on the date of advance and distributed on that date in
               payment of the outstanding principal amount of the related Class
               of Offered Notes in respect of which such Liquidity Advance or
               Maturity Advance was made.

         (c)   If the Servicer has made a Liquidity Advance, the Servicer will
               be immediately reimbursed for such Liquidity Advance upon receipt
               by the Issuer of the proceeds of the additional Class VPN Loan.
               If the proceeds of any Class VPN Loan in respect of which a
               Liquidity Advance has been made are not paid to the Issuer within
               two Business Days after the date on which such Liquidity Advance
               is made, the Servicer shall have the right to be reimbursed for
               such Liquidity Advance in priority to payments of principal on
               the Offered Notes or the Class VPN Loans as provided in Section
               5.6(c).

         (d)   If the Servicer has made any Maturity Advances, (i) the amount of
               such Maturity Advances will be repaid to the Servicer in
               accordance with the Series Supplement after the Outstanding
               Amounts of all Offered Notes and Class VPN Loans have been paid
               in full and (ii) for all purposes of this Agreement, the
               Indenture and the Series Supplement (including clause (c)(i)
               above), the outstanding Maturity Advances shall be deemed to be
               (A) non-interest bearing Class B Notes having an Outstanding
               Amount equal to the principal amount of such Maturity Advances,
               in the case of Maturity Advances made to repay the Class B Notes,
               and (B) non-interest

<PAGE>

                                       13

               bearing Class C Notes having an Outstanding Amount equal to the
               principal amount of such Maturity Advances, in the case of
               Maturity Advances made to repay the Class C Notes.

obligation of the Seller to repurchase any Receivable with respect to which a
breach of the representations and warranties pursuant to Section 3.1 or Section
6.1 has occurred and is continuing shall, if such obligation is fulfilled,
constitute the sole remedy of the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee, the Series
C2002-1 Debtholders or the other Related Specified Creditors with respect to for
such breach.

3.3      CUSTODY OF RECEIVABLE FILES.

         (a)   To assure uniform quality in servicing the Receivables and to
               reduce administrative costs, (x) the Issuer and the Indenture
               Trustee hereby revocably appoints the Servicer, and the Servicer
               hereby accepts such appointment, to act as the agent of the

               terms and conditions set forth in the Custodian Agreement, all of
               which are incorporated herein by reference, and (y) in connection
               with the sale, transfer and assignment of the Purchased Assets to
               the Issuer pursuant to this Agreement and simultaneously with the
               execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Servicer shall

               forth in the Custodian Agreement, which Receivables Files shall
               be delivered to the Custodian as agent

                                       14

               of the Indenture Trustee on or before the Closing Date (with
               respect to each Initial Receivable) and on or before the
               Subsequent Transfer Date (with respect to each Subsequent
               Receivable), and the Indenture Trustee and the Servicer shall
               enter into the Custodian Agreement with the Custodian on the
               Closing Date. The Receivables File for each Receivable consists
               of:

               (i)    the fully executed original of the Receivable (together
                      with any agreements modifying the Receivable, including,
                      without limitation, any extension agreements);

               (ii)   the original credit application, or a copy thereof, of
                      each Obligor, fully executed by each such Obligor on
                      AmeriCredit's customary form, or on a form approved by

               (iii)  the original acknowledgement copy or time-stamped receipt
                      copy of the financing statements or other such documents
                      or instruments that the Servicer shall keep on file, in
                      accordance with its customary procedures, perfecting the
                      security interest of the Seller in the Financed Vehicles;
                      and

               (iv)   any and all other documents that the Servicer or the
                      Seller shall keep on file, in accordance with its
                      customary procedures, relating to a Receivable, an Obligor
                      or any of the Financed Vehicles.

         (b)   The Indenture Trustee may act as the Custodian, in which case the
               Indenture Trustee shall be deemed to have assumed the obligations
               of the Custodian specified in the Custodian Agreement. Upon
               payment in full of any Receivable, the Servicer will notify the
               Custodian pursuant to a certificate of an officer of the Servicer
               (which certificate shall include a statement to the effect that
               all amounts received in connection with such payments which are
               required to be deposited in the Collection Account pursuant to
               Section 4.1 have been so deposited) and shall request delivery of
               the Receivable and Receivable File to the Servicer. From time to
               time as appropriate for servicing and enforcing any Receivable,
               the Custodian shall, upon written request of an officer of the
               Servicer and delivery to the Custodian of a receipt signed by
               such officer, cause the original Receivable and the related
               Receivable File to be released to the Servicer. The Servicer's
               receipt of a Receivable and/or Receivable File shall obligate the
               Servicer to return the original Receivable and the related
               Receivable File to the Custodian when its need by the Servicer
               has ceased unless the Receivable is repurchased as described in
               Section 3.2 or 4.7.

                   Administration and Servicing of Receivables

4.1      DUTIES OF THE SERVICER

         (a)   The Servicer is hereby authorized to act as agent for the Issuer
               and in such capacity shall manage, service, administer and make
               collections on the Receivables, and perform the other actions
               required by the Servicer under this Agreement. The Servicer
               agrees that its servicing of the Receivables shall be

                                       15

               carried out in accordance with customary and usual procedures of
               institutions which service motor vehicle retail installment sales
               contracts and, to the extent more exacting, the degree of skill
               and attention that the Servicer exercises from time to time with
               respect to all comparable receivables that it services for itself
               or others. In performing such duties, so long as AmeriCredit
               Canada is the Servicer, it shall substantially comply with the
               policies and procedures described on Schedule C, as such policies
               and procedures may be updated from time to time. The Servicer's
               duties shall include, without limitation, collection and posting
               of all payments, responding to inquiries of Obligors on the
               Receivables, investigating delinquencies, sending payment coupons
               to Obligors, reporting any required tax information to Obligors,
               monitoring the collateral, complying with the terms of the
               Depository Account Agreement, accounting for collections and
               furnishing monthly and annual statements to the Indenture Trustee
               and the Issuer with respect to distributions, monitoring the
               status of Insurance Policies with respect to the Financed
               Vehicles and performing the other duties specified herein.

         (b)   The Servicer shall also administer and enforce all rights and
               responsibilities of the holder of the Receivables provided for in
               the Dealer Agreements (and shall maintain possession of the
               Dealer Agreements to the extent it is necessary to do so), the
               Dealer Assignments and the Insurance Policies, to the extent that
               such Dealer Agreements, Dealer Assignments and Insurance Policies
               relate to the Receivables, the Financed Vehicles or the Obligors.
               To the extent consistent with the standards, policies and
               procedures otherwise required hereby, the Servicer shall follow
               its customary standards, policies, and procedures and shall have
               full power and authority, acting alone, to do any and all things
               in connection with such managing, servicing, administration and
               collection that it may deem necessary or desirable. Without
               limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Servicer is hereby
               authorized and empowered by the Issuer to execute and deliver, on
               behalf of the Issuer, any and all instruments of satisfaction or
               cancellation, or of partial or full release or discharge, and all
               other comparable instruments, with respect to the Receivables and
               with respect to the Financed Vehicles; provided, however, that
               notwithstanding the foregoing, the Servicer shall not, except
               pursuant to an order from a court of competent jurisdiction,
               release an Obligor from payment of any unpaid amount under any
               Receivable or waive the right to collect the unpaid balance of
               any Receivable from the Obligor, except in accordance with the
               Servicer's customary practices. For greater certainty, the
               Servicer is granted a power of attorney and a mandate for the
               purpose of executing with respect to the Receivables and the
               security interests created thereby, on behalf of the Issuer, the
               Indenture Trustee, the Series C2002-1 Debtholders and other
               Related Specified Creditors, any and all acquittances,
               mainlevees, radiations, cancellations, reductions, retrocessions
               and all other documents for the purpose of discharging,
               releasing, reassigning, retroceding, waiving or subordinating any
               reservation of title, hypothec, lease, right of ownership under a
               leasing contract (credit-bail), security interest, charge in
               respect of accounts receivable and any other personal or real
               right contained in or created by the Receivables and which may
               from time to time be registered in the Province of Quebec against
               on Obligor under or with respect to the Receivables, and more
               particularly, at the Register of Personal and Moveable Real
               Rights,

<PAGE>

                                       16

               including endorsing the Issuer's, the Indenture Trustee's, the
               Series C2002-1 Debtholders' or the other Related Specified
               Creditors' name on any consent, filings, registrations or other
               documents in furtherance thereof.

         (c)   The Servicer is hereby authorized to commence, in its own name or
               in the name of the Issuer, a legal proceeding to enforce a
               Receivable pursuant to Section 4.3 or to commence or participate
               in any other legal proceeding (including, without limitation, a
               bankruptcy proceeding) relating to or involving a Receivable, an
               Obligor or a Financed Vehicle. If the Servicer commences or
               participates in such a legal proceeding in its own name, the
               Issuer shall thereupon be deemed to have automatically assigned
               such Receivable to the Servicer solely for purposes of commencing
               or participating in any such proceeding as a party or claimant,
               and the Servicer is authorized and empowered by the Issuer to
               execute and deliver in the Servicer's name any notices, demands,
               claims, complaints, responses, affidavits or other documents or
               instruments in connection with any such proceeding. The Issuer
               and the Indenture Trustee shall furnish the Servicer with any
               limited powers of attorney and other documents which the Servicer
               may reasonably request and which the Servicer deems necessary or
               appropriate and take any other steps which the Servicer may deem
               necessary or appropriate to enable the Servicer to carry out its
               servicing and administrative duties under this Agreement.

4.2      COLLECTION OF RECEIVABLE PAYMENTS; MODIFICATIONS OF RECEIVABLES;
         DEPOSITORY ACCOUNT AGREEMENTS.

         (a)   Consistent with the standards, policies and procedures required
               by this Agreement, the Servicer shall make reasonable efforts to
               collect all payments called for under the terms and provisions of
               the Receivables as and when the same shall become due, and shall
               follow such collection procedures as it follows with respect to
               all comparable receivables that it services for itself or others
               and otherwise act with respect to the Receivables, the Dealer
               Agreements, the Dealer Assignments, the Insurance Policies and
               the Related Collateral in such manner as will, in the reasonable
               judgement of the Servicer, maximize the amount to be received by
               the Issuer with respect thereto. The Servicer is authorized in
               its discretion to waive any prepayment charge, late payment
               charge or any other similar fees that may be collected in the
               ordinary course of servicing any Receivable.

         (b)   The Servicer may (A) at any time agree to a modification or
               amendment of a Receivable in order to (i) change the Obligor's
               regular due date to a date within the Collection Period in which
               such due date occurs or (ii) re-amortize the Scheduled
               Receivables Payments on the Receivable following a partial
               prepayment of principal, in accordance with its customary
               procedures or (B) may direct the Issuer to sell Receivables
               pursuant to Section 4.3(c) if the Servicer believes in good faith
               that such extension, modification, amendment or sale is necessary
               to avoid a default on such Receivable, will maximize the amount
               to be received by the Issuer with respect to such Receivable, and
               is otherwise in the best interests of the Issuer.

<PAGE>

                                       17

         (c)   The Servicer may grant payment extensions on, or other
               modifications or amendments to, a Receivable (in addition to
               those modifications permitted by Section 4.2(b)) in accordance
               with its customary procedures if the Servicer believes in good
               faith that such extension, modification or amendment is necessary
               to avoid a default on such Receivable, will maximize the amount
               to be received by the Issuer with respect to such Receivable, and
               is otherwise in the best interests of the Issuer; provided,
               however, that:

               (i)    the aggregate period of all extensions on a Receivable
                      shall not exceed 12 months; and

               (ii)   in no event may a Receivable be extended beyond the
                      Collection Period immediately preceding the latest Final
                      Scheduled Monthly Payment Date.

         (d)   The Servicer shall maintain the following system for collecting
               and processing payments on the Receivables and the other motor
               vehicle retail instalment sale contracts or security agreements
               owned or serviced by the Servicer or AmeriCredit Canada. The
               Servicer shall establish and maintain one or more segregated
               deposit accounts (collectively, the "Depository Account") at the
               Depository Bank. The Depository Account shall be maintained by
               the Servicer for and on behalf of AmeriCredit Canada, the
               Custodian and each other owner of motor vehicle retail instalment
               sale contracts or security agreements originated and owned or
               serviced by the Servicer or AmeriCredit Canada. The Servicer
               shall use its best efforts to notify or direct Obligors to make
               all cheque or other mail payments on the Receivables directly to
               the Depository Account and all direct debit payments on the
               Receivables to the Depository Account. The Servicer shall not
               permit any payments other than payments on the Receivables and
               other motor vehicle retail instalment sale contracts or security
               agreements originated and owned or serviced by the Servicer or
               AmeriCredit Canada to be made to the Depository Account. The
               Servicer shall use its best efforts to notify or direct the
               Depository Bank to deposit all payments on the Receivables in the
               Depository Account no later than the Business Day after receipt,
               and to cause all amounts credited to the Depository Account on
               account of such payments to be transferred to the Depository
               Account no later than the second Business Day after receipt of
               such payments. The Servicer shall cause all amounts credited to
               the Depository Account on account of payments on the Receivables
               to be transferred to the Collection Account no later than the
               second Business Day after receipt of such payments in the
               Depository Account. The Depository Account shall be a demand
               deposit account held by the Depository Bank, and shall be an
               Eligible Deposit Account. The Servicer may at any time move the
               Depository Account to another Eligible Deposit Account provided
               the Servicer shall give the Indenture Trustee and the Backup
               Servicer written notice of such new Depository Account.

         (e)   Prior to the Closing Date, the Servicer shall have notified each
               Obligor that makes its payments on the Receivables by cheque to
               make such payments thereafter directly to the Depository Bank
               (except in the case of Obligors that have already been making
               such payments to the Depository Bank), and shall have provided
               each such Obligor with remittance invoices in order to enable
               such Obligors to

<PAGE>

                                       18

               make such payments directly to the Depository Bank for deposit
               into the Depository Account, and the Seller will continue, not
               less often than every three months, to so notify those Obligors
               who have failed to make payments to the Depository Bank. The
               Servicer shall request each Obligor that makes payment on the
               Receivables by direct debit of such Obligor's bank account, to
               execute a new authorization for automatic payment sufficient to
               authorize direct debit by the Depository Bank. If at any time,
               the Depository Bank is unable to directly debit an Obligor's bank
               account that makes payment on the Receivables by direct debit and
               if such inability is not cured within 15 days or cannot be cured
               by execution by the Obligor of a new authorization for automatic
               payment, the Servicer shall notify such Obligor that it cannot
               make payment by direct debit and must thereafter make payment by
               cheque.

         (f)   In the event of a termination of the Servicer, the Successor
               Servicer shall establish a new Depository Account or similar
               collection processing system in accordance with and subject to
               the terms hereof. The outgoing Servicer shall deliver to the
               Successor Servicer all documents and records relating to each
               such Depository Account and an accounting of amounts collected
               and held by the Depository Bank and otherwise use its best
               efforts to effect the orderly and efficient transfer of any
               Depository Account to the Successor Servicer.

         (g)   The Servicer shall deposit all payments by or on behalf of the
               Obligors received directly by the Servicer to the Depository Bank
               without deposit into any intervening account and as soon as
               practicable, but in no event later than three Business Days after
               receipt thereof.

4.3      REALIZATION UPON RECEIVABLES.

         (a)   Consistent with the standards, policies and procedures required
               by this Agreement, the Servicer shall use its best efforts to
               repossess (or otherwise comparably convert the ownership of) and
               liquidate any Financed Vehicle securing a Receivable with respect
               to which the Servicer has determined that payments thereunder are
               not likely to be resumed, as soon as is practicable after default
               on such Receivable but in no event later than the date on which
               all or any portion of a Scheduled Receivables Payment has become
               91 days delinquent; provided, however, that the Servicer may
               elect not to repossess a Financed Vehicle within such time period
               if in its good faith judgement it determines that the proceeds
               ultimately recoverable with respect to such Receivable would be
               increased by forbearance. The Servicer is authorized to follow
               such customary practices and procedures as it shall deem
               necessary or advisable, consistent with the standard of care
               required by Section 4.1, which practices and procedures may
               include reasonable efforts to realize upon any recourse to
               Dealers, the sale of the related Financed Vehicle at public or
               private sale, the submission of claims under an Insurance Policy
               and other actions by the Servicer in order to realize upon such a
               Receivable. The foregoing is subject to the provision that, in
               any case in which the Financed Vehicle shall have suffered
               damage, the Servicer shall not expend funds in connection with
               any repair or towards the repossession of such Financed Vehicle
               unless it shall determine in its discretion that such repair
               and/or

<PAGE>

                                       19

               repossession shall increase the proceeds of liquidation of the
               related Receivable by an amount greater than the amount of such
               expenses. All amounts received upon liquidation of a Financed
               Vehicle shall be remitted directly by the Servicer to the
               Collection Account without deposit into any intervening account
               as soon as practicable, but in no event later than the Business
               Day after receipt thereof. The Servicer shall be entitled to
               recover all reasonable expenses incurred by it in the course of
               repossessing and liquidating a Financed Vehicle into cash
               proceeds, but only out of the cash proceeds of such Financed
               Vehicle, any deficiency obtained from the Obligor or any amounts
               received from the related Dealer, which amounts in reimbursement
               may be retained by the Servicer (and shall not be required to be
               deposited as provided in Section 4.2(e)) to the extent of such
               expenses. The Servicer shall pay on behalf of the Issuer any
               personal property taxes assessed on repossessed, liquidated
               Financed Vehicles. The Servicer shall be entitled to
               reimbursement of any such tax from Net Liquidation Proceeds with
               respect to such Receivable.

         (b)   If the Servicer elects to commence a legal proceeding to enforce
               a Dealer Agreement or Dealer Assignment, the act of commencement
               shall be deemed to be an automatic assignment from the Issuer to
               the Servicer of the rights under such Dealer Agreement or Dealer
               Assignment for purposes of collection only. If, however, in any
               enforcement suit or legal proceeding it is held that the Servicer
               may not enforce a Dealer Agreement or Dealer Assignment on the
               grounds that it is not a real party in interest or a Person
               entitled to enforce the Dealer Agreement or Dealer Assignment,
               the Issuer or the Indenture Trustee, at the Servicer's expense,
               or the Seller, at the Seller's expense, shall take such steps as
               the Servicer deems reasonably necessary to enforce the Dealer
               Agreement or Dealer Assignment, including bringing suit in its
               name or the name of the Seller or of the Issuer and the Trustee
               or the Indenture Trustee for the benefit of the Series C2002-1
               Debtholders and the other Related Specified Creditors. All
               amounts recovered shall be remitted directly by the Servicer as
               provided in Section 4.2(e).

         (c)   Consistent with the standards, policies and procedures required
               by this Agreement, the Servicer may use its best efforts to
               locate a third party purchaser that is not affiliated with the
               Servicer, the Seller or the Issuer to purchase from the Issuer
               any Receivable that has become more than 60 days delinquent, and
               shall have the right to direct the Issuer to sell any such
               Receivable to the third party purchaser; provided, that only
               Receivables having an aggregate Principal Balance of no more than
               20% of the number of Receivables purchased by the Issuer from the
               Seller may be sold by the Issuer pursuant to this Section 4.3(c);
               provided further, that the Servicer may elect to not direct the
               Issuer to sell a Receivable that has become more than 60 days
               delinquent if in its good faith judgement the Servicer determines
               that the proceeds ultimately recoverable with respect to such
               Receivable would be increased by forbearance. The aggregate
               Purchase Amounts received by the Issuer for all Receivables sold
               to a single third-party purchaser on a single date must be at
               least equal to the sum of the Minimum Sale Prices for all such
               Receivables. The Servicer shall remit or cause the third-party
               purchaser to remit all sale proceeds from the sale of Receivables
               directly to the Collection

                                       20

               Account without deposit into any intervening account as soon as
               practicable, but in no event later than the Business Day after
               receipt thereof.

4.4      INSURANCE.

         (a)   The Servicer shall require, in accordance with its customary
               servicing policies and procedures, that each Financed Vehicle be
               insured by the related Obligor under the Insurance Policies
               referred to in item 16 of the Schedule of Representations and
               shall monitor the status of such physical loss and damage
               insurance coverage thereafter, in accordance with its customary
               servicing procedures. Each Receivable requires the Obligor to
               maintain such physical loss and damage insurance, naming
               AmeriCredit Canada and its successors and assigns as additional
               insureds, and permits the holder of such Receivable to obtain
               physical loss and damage insurance at the expense of the Obligor
               if the Obligor fails to maintain such insurance. If the Servicer
               shall determine that an Obligor has failed to obtain or maintain
               a physical loss and damage Insurance Policy covering the related
               Financed Vehicle which satisfies the conditions set forth in item
               16 of the Schedule of Representations (including, without
               limitation, during the repossession of such Financed Vehicle) the
               Servicer may enforce the rights of the holder of the Receivable
               under the Receivable to require the Obligor to obtain such
               physical loss and damage insurance in accordance with its
               customary servicing policies and procedures. The Servicer may
               maintain a vendor's single interest or other collateral
               protection insurance policy with respect to all Financed Vehicles
               ("Collateral Insurance") which policy shall by its terms insure
               against physical loss and damage in the event any Obligor fails
               to maintain physical loss and damage insurance with respect to
               the related Financed Vehicle. All policies of Collateral
               Insurance shall be endorsed with clauses providing for loss
               payable to the Servicer. Costs incurred by the Servicer in
               maintaining such Collateral Insurance shall be paid by the
               Servicer.

         (b)   The Servicer may, if an Obligor fails to obtain or maintain a
               physical loss and damage Insurance Policy, obtain insurance with
               respect to the related Financed Vehicle and advance on behalf of
               such Obligor, as required under the terms of the insurance
               policy, the premiums for such insurance (such insurance being
               referred to herein as "Force-Placed Insurance"). All policies of
               Force-Placed Insurance shall be endorsed with clauses providing
               for loss payable to the Servicer. Any cost incurred by the
               Servicer in maintaining such Force-Placed Insurance shall only be
               recoverable out of premiums paid by the Obligors or Net
               Liquidation Proceeds with respect to the Receivable, as provided
               in Section 4.4(c).

         (c)   In connection with any Force-Placed Insurance obtained hereunder,
               the Servicer may, in the manner and to the extent permitted by
               applicable law, require the Obligors to repay the entire premium
               to the Servicer. In no event shall the Servicer include the
               amount of the premium in the Amount Financed under the
               Receivable. For all purposes of this Agreement, the Insurance
               Add-On Amount with respect to any Receivable having Force-Placed
               Insurance will be treated as a separate obligation of the Obligor
               and will not be added to the Principal Balance of such
               Receivable, and amounts allocable thereto will not be available
               for

<PAGE>

                                       21

               distribution on the Notes and the Certificates. The Servicer
               shall retain and separately administer the right to receive
               payments from Obligors with respect to Insurance Add-On Amounts
               or rebates of Forced-Placed Insurance premiums. If an Obligor
               makes a payment with respect to a Receivable having Force-Placed
               Insurance, but the Servicer is unable to determine whether the
               payment is allocable to the Receivable or to the Insurance Add-On
               Amount, the payment shall be applied first to any unpaid
               Scheduled Receivables Payments and then to the Insurance Add-On
               Amount. Net Liquidation Proceeds on any Receivable will be used
               first to pay the Principal Balance and accrued interest on such
               Receivable and then to pay the related Insurance Add-On Amount.
               If an Obligor under a Receivable with respect to which the
               Servicer has placed Force-Placed Insurance fails to make
               scheduled payments of such Insurance Add-On Amount as due, and
               the Servicer has determined that eventual payment of the
               Insurance Add-On Amount is unlikely, the Servicer may, but shall
               not be required to, purchase such Receivable from the Issuer for
               the Purchase Amount on any subsequent Determination Date. Any
               such Receivable, and any Receivable with respect to which the
               Servicer has placed Force-Placed Insurance which has been paid in
               full (excluding any Insurance Add-On Amounts) will be assigned to
               the Servicer.

         (d)   The Servicer may sue to enforce or collect upon the Insurance
               Policies, in its own name, if possible, or as agent of the
               Issuer. If the Servicer elects to commence a legal proceeding to
               enforce an Insurance Policy, the act of commencement shall be
               deemed to be an automatic assignment of the rights of the Issuer
               under such Insurance Policy to the Servicer for purposes of
               collection only. If, however, in any enforcement suit or legal
               proceeding it is held that the Servicer may not enforce an
               Insurance Policy on the grounds that it is not a real party in
               interest or a holder entitled to enforce the Insurance Policy,
               the Issuer and/or the Indenture Trustee, at the Servicer's
               expense, or the Seller, at the Seller's expense, shall take such
               steps as the Servicer deems necessary to enforce such Insurance
               Policy, including bringing suit in its name or the name of the
               Issuer and the Trustee and/or the Indenture Trustee for the
               benefit of the Series C2002-1 Debtholders.

         (e)   The Servicer will cause itself and may cause the Issuer, the
               Trustee and the Indenture Trustee to be named as named insured
               under all policies of Collateral Insurance.

4.5      MAINTENANCE OF SECURITY INTERESTS IN VEHICLES.

         (a)   Consistent with the policies and procedures required by this
               Agreement, the Servicer shall take such steps on behalf of the
               Issuer as are necessary to maintain perfection of the security
               interest created by each Receivable in the related Financed
               Vehicle, including, but not limited to, recording, registering,
               filing, re-recording, re-filing, and re-registering of all
               Financing Statements as are necessary to maintain the security
               interest granted by the Obligors under the respective
               Receivables. The Indenture Trustee hereby authorizes the
               Servicer, and the Servicer agrees, to take any and all steps
               necessary to re-perfect such security interest on behalf of the
               Issuer as necessary because of the relocation of a Financed
               Vehicle or for any other reason.

<PAGE>

                                       22

         (b)   AmeriCredit Canada hereby agrees to pay all expenses related to
               such perfection or reperfection and to take all action necessary
               therefor. AmeriCredit Canada hereby appoints the Indenture
               Trustee as its attorney-in-fact to take any and all steps
               required to be performed by AmeriCredit Canada pursuant to this
               Section 4.5(b) (it being understood that and agreed that the
               Indenture Trustee shall have no obligation to take such steps
               with respect to all perfection or reperfection, except as
               pursuant to the Basic Documents to which it is a party and to
               which AmeriCredit Canada has paid all expenses), including
               execution of certificates of title or any other documents in the
               name and stead of AmeriCredit Canada, and the Indenture Trustee
               hereby accepts such appointment.

4.6      COVENANTS, REPRESENTATIONS, AND WARRANTIES OF SERVICER

By its execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Servicer makes the
following representations, warranties and covenants on which the Issuer relies
in accepting the Receivables and on which the Indenture Trustee relies in
authenticating the Notes.

         (a)   The Servicer covenants as follows:

               (i)    Liens in Force. The Financed Vehicle securing each
                      Receivable shall not be released in whole or in part from
                      the security interest granted by the Receivable, except
                      upon payment in full of the Receivable or as otherwise
                      contemplated herein;

               (ii)   No Impairment. The Servicer shall do nothing to impair the
                      rights of the Issuer or the Series C2002-1 Debtholders in
                      the Receivables, the Dealer Agreements, the Dealer
                      Assignments, the Insurance Policies or the Related
                      Collateral except as otherwise expressly provided herein;

               (iii)  No Amendments. The Servicer shall not extend or otherwise
                      amend the terms of any Receivable, except in accordance
                      with Section 4.2; and

               (iv)   Restrictions on Liens. The Servicer shall not (i) create,
                      incur or suffer to exist, or agree to create, incur or
                      suffer to exist, or consent to cause or permit in the
                      future (upon the happening of a contingency or otherwise)
                      the creation, incurrence or existence of any Lien or
                      restriction on transferability of the Receivables except
                      for the Lien in favour of the Indenture Trustee for the
                      benefit of the Series C2002-1 Debtholders and the
                      restrictions on transferability imposed by this Agreement
                      or (ii) sign or file under the PPSA of any jurisdiction
                      any financing statement which names AmeriCredit Canada or
                      the Servicer as a debtor, or sign any security agreement
                      authorizing any secured party thereunder to file such
                      financing statement, with respect to the Receivables,
                      except in each case any such instrument solely securing
                      the rights and interests of the Issuer or the rights and
                      preserving the Lien of the Indenture Trustee, for the
                      benefit of the Series C2002-1 Debtholders and the other
                      Related Specified Creditors.

<PAGE>

                                       23

         (b)   The Servicer represents, warrants and covenants as of the Closing
               Date and as of each Subsequent Transfer Date as to itself that
               the representations and warranties set forth in Section 7.1 are
               true and correct; provided that such representations and
               warranties contained therein and herein shall not apply to any
               entity other than AmeriCredit Canada.

4.7      PURCHASE OF RECEIVABLES UPON BREACH OF COVENANT

Upon discovery by any of the Servicer, a Responsible Officer of the Indenture
Trustee or a Responsible Officer of the Trustee of a breach of any of the
covenants set forth in Sections 4.5(a) or 4.6(a), the party discovering such
breach shall give prompt written notice to the others; provided, however, that
the failure to give any such notice shall not affect any obligation of
AmeriCredit Canada as Servicer under this Section 4.7. As of the second
Accounting Date (or, at AmeriCredit Canada's election, the first Accounting
Date) following its discovery or receipt of notice of any breach of any covenant
set forth in Sections 4.5(a) or 4.6(a) which materially and adversely affects
the interests of the Issuer or of the Series C2002-1 Debtholders and the other
Related Specified Creditors in any Receivable (including any Liquidated
Receivable) or the related Financed Vehicle (determined without regard to the
availability of funds from any credit enhancement in the form of the
over-collateralization represented by the Class D Notes or in the form of the
Reserve Account), AmeriCredit Canada shall, unless such breach shall have been
cured in all material respects, purchase from the Issuer the Receivable affected
by such breach and, on the related Determination Date, AmeriCredit Canada shall
pay the related Purchase Amount. It is understood and agreed that the obligation
of AmeriCredit Canada to purchase any Receivable (including any Liquidated
Receivable) with respect to which such a breach has occurred and is continuing
shall, if such obligation is fulfilled, constitute the sole remedy against
AmeriCredit Canada for such breach available to the Series C2002-1 Debtholders,
the Issuer or the Indenture Trustee; provided, however, that AmeriCredit Canada
shall indemnify the Issuer, the Trustee, the Indenture Trustee, the Backup
Servicer and the Series C2002-1 Debtholders from and against all costs,
expenses, losses, damages, claims and liabilities, including reasonable fees and
expenses of counsel, which may be asserted against or incurred by any of them
arising out of the events or facts giving rise to such breach. This section
shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the earlier removal or
resignation of the Backup Servicer, Trustee and/or the Indenture Trustee.

4.8      SERVICING FEE; PAYMENT OF CERTAIN EXPENSES BY SERVICER

On each Monthly Payment Date, the Servicer shall be entitled to receive out of
the Collection Account the Servicing Fee pursuant to Section 5.6. The Servicer
shall be required to pay all expenses incurred by it in connection with its
activities under this Agreement (including taxes imposed on the Servicer,
expenses incurred in connection with distributions and reports made by the
Servicer to the Series C2002-1 Debtholders and all other fees and expenses of
(except taxes of or payable by) the Trustee, the Indenture Trustee, the Backup
Servicer, the Depository Bank and the Independent Accountants). The Servicer
shall be liable for the fees and expenses of the Trustee, the Indenture Trustee,
the Backup Servicer, the Depository Bank (and any fees under the Depository
Account Agreement) and the Independent Accountants.

                                       24

4.9      Servicer's Certificate.

No later than 12:00 p.m. Eastern time on each Determination Date, the Servicer
shall deliver (facsimile delivery being acceptable) to the Issuer, the Indenture
Trustee, the Backup Servicer and each Rating Agency a Servicer's Certificate
executed by a Responsible Officer of the Servicer containing among other things,
(i) all information necessary to enable the Indenture Trustee to make any
withdrawal and deposit required by Section 5.8, (ii) a listing of all Purchased
Receivables, Sold Receivables and Administrative Receivables purchased or sold
as of the related Accounting Date, identifying the Receivables so purchased or
sold, (iii) all information necessary to enable the Indenture Trustee to send
the statements to Series C2002-1 Debtholders required by Section 5.10, and (iv)
all information necessary to enable the Indenture Trustee to reconcile the
aggregate cash flows, the Collection Account for the related Collection Period
and Monthly Payment Date, including the accounting required by Section 5.11.
Receivables purchased by the Servicer or by the Seller on the related Accounting
Date and each Receivable which became a Liquidated Receivable or which was paid
in full during the related Collection Period shall be identified by account
number (as set forth in the Schedule of Receivables).

4.10     ANNUAL STATEMENT AS TO COMPLIANCE, NOTICE OF SERVICER TERMINATION
         EVENT.

         (a)   The Servicer shall deliver to the Trustee, the Indenture Trustee,
               the Backup Servicer and each Rating Agency, on or before October
               31 (or 120 days after the end of the Servicer's fiscal year, if
               other than June 30) of each year, beginning on October 31, 2003,
               an officer's certificate signed by any Responsible Officer of the
               Servicer, dated as of June 30 (or other applicable date) of such
               year, stating that (i) a review of the activities of the Servicer
               during the preceding 12-month period (or such other period as
               shall have elapsed from the Closing Date to the date of the first
               such certificate (which period shall not be less than six
               months)) and of its performance under this Agreement has been
               made under such officer's supervision, and (ii) to such officer's
               knowledge, based on such review, the Servicer has fulfilled all
               its obligations under this Agreement throughout such period, or,
               if there has been a default in the fulfilment of any such
               obligation, specifying each such default known to such officer
               and the nature and status thereof.

         (b)   The Servicer shall deliver to the Trustee, the Indenture Trustee,
               the Backup Servicer and each Rating Agency, promptly after having
               obtained knowledge thereof, but in no event later than two (2)
               Business Days thereafter, written notice in an officer's
               certificate of any event which with the giving of notice or lapse
               of time, or both, would become a Servicer Termination Event under
               Section 8.1(a). The Seller or the Servicer shall deliver to the
               Trustee, the Indenture Trustee, the Servicer, the Backup Servicer
               or the Seller (as applicable) and each Rating Agency promptly
               after having obtained knowledge thereof, but in no event later
               than two (2) Business Days thereafter, written notice in an
               officer's certificate of any event which with the giving of
               notice or lapse of time, or both, would become a Servicer
               Termination Event under any other clause of Section 8.1.

4.11     ANNUAL INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS' REPORT

The Servicer shall cause a firm of nationally recognized independent certified
public accountants (the "Independent Accountants"), who may also render other
services to the Servicer, the Backup Servicer or to the Seller, to deliver to
the Trustee, the Indenture Trustee, the Backup Servicer and each Rating Agency,
on or before October 31 (or 120 days after the end of the Servicer's fiscal
year, if other than June 30) of each year, beginning on October 31, 2003, with
respect to the twelve months ended the immediately preceding June 30 (or other
applicable date) (or such other period as shall have elapsed from the Closing
Date to the date of such certificate (which period shall not be less than six
months)), a statement (the "Accountants' Report") addressed to the Board of
Directors of the Servicer and to the Trustee, to the effect that such firm has
audited the books and records of AmeriCredit Corp., in which the Servicer is
included as a consolidated subsidiary, and issued its report thereon in
connection with the audit report on the consolidated financial statements of
AmeriCredit Corp. and that (1) such audit was made in accordance with generally
accepted auditing standards, and accordingly included such tests of the
accounting records and such other auditing procedures as such firm considered
necessary in the circumstances; (2) the firm is independent of the Seller and
the Servicer within the meaning of the Code of Professional Ethics of the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and (3) includes a report on
the application of agreed upon procedures to three randomly selected Servicer's
Certificates noting whether any exceptions or errors in the Servicer's
Certificates were found.

4.12     ACCESS TO CERTAIN DOCUMENTATION AND INFORMATION REGARDING RECEIVABLES

The Servicer shall provide to representatives of the Trustee, the Indenture
Trustee and the Backup Servicer reasonable access to the Receivables Files and
other documentation regarding the Receivables. In each case, such access shall

                      the Series C2002-1 Debtholders.

               Investments in accordance with the written directions of the
               Servicer (which written direction may be in the form of standing
               instructions). All such Eligible Investments shall be held by the
               Indenture Trustee for the benefit of the Series C2002-1
               Debtholders and other Related Specified Creditors, provided,
               however, that on each Determination Date all Investment Earnings

               Collection Account and shall be deemed to constitute a portion of
               the Available Funds for the following Monthly Payment Date. Funds

               Specified Creditors. If, at any time, any of the Series Accounts
               ceases to be an Eligible Deposit Account, the Indenture Trustee
               (or the Servicer on its behalf) shall within 10 Business Days (or
               such longer period, not to exceed 30 calendar days, as to which
               each Rating Agency may consent) establish a new Series Account as
               an Eligible Deposit Account and shall transfer any cash and/or
               any investments to such new Series Account.

         (d)   With respect to the Series Account Property, the Indenture
               Trustee agrees that:

               (i)    any Series Account Property that is held in deposit
                      accounts shall be held solely in Eligible Deposit
                      Accounts, subject to the last sentence of Section 5.1(c);
                      and each such Eligible Deposit Account shall be subject to
                      the exclusive custody and control of the Indenture
                      Trustee, and the Indenture Trustee shall have sole signing
                      authority with respect thereto;

               (ii)   any Series Account Property that constitutes a
                      certificated security shall be delivered to the Indenture
                      Trustee in accordance with paragraph (b) of the definition
                      of "Delivery" and shall be held, pending maturity or
                      disposition, solely by the Indenture Trustee or its agent;

               (iii)  any Series Account Property that is a book-entry security
                      held through a Clearing Agency shall be delivered in
                      accordance with paragraph (c) of the definition of
                      "Delivery" and shall be maintained, pending maturity or
                      disposition, through continued book-entry registration of
                      such Series Account Property as described in such
                      paragraph; and

               (iv)   any Series Account Property that is an "uncertificated
                      security" as defined under the PPSA as in effect in the
                      Province of Ontario and that is not governed by clause
                      (iii) above shall be delivered to the Indenture Trustee or
                      its agent in accordance with paragraphs (c) or (d) of the
                      definition of "Delivery" and shall be maintained by the
                      Indenture Trustee, pending maturity or disposition,
                      through continued registration of the Indenture Trustee's
                      (or its nominee's) ownership of such security.

         (e)   The Servicer shall have the power, revocable by the Indenture
               Trustee or the Issuer with the consent of the Indenture Trustee,
               to instruct the Indenture Trustee to make withdrawals and
               payments from the Series Accounts for the purpose of permitting
               the Servicer or the Issuer to carry out its respective duties
               hereunder or permitting the Indenture Trustee to carry out its
               duties under the Indenture.

         (f)   The Indenture Trustee shall not in any way be held liable by
               reason of any insufficiency in any of the Series Accounts
               resulting from any loss on any Eligible Investment included
               therein except for losses attributable to the Indenture Trustee's
               negligence or bad faith or its failure to make payments on such
               Eligible Investments issued by the Indenture Trustee, in its
               commercial capacity as principal obligor and not as trustee, in
               accordance with their terms.

         (g)   If (i) the Servicer shall have failed to give investment
               directions in writing for any funds on deposit in the Series
               Accounts to the Indenture Trustee by 1:00 p.m. Eastern Time (or
               such other time as may be agreed by the Issuer and Indenture
               Trustee) on any Business Day; or (ii) a Default or Event of
               Default shall have occurred and be continuing with respect to the
               Series C2002-1 Debt Obligations but the Series C2002-1 Debt
               Obligations shall not have been declared due and payable, or, if
               such Series C2002-1 Debt Obligations shall have been declared due
               and payable following an Event of Default, amounts collected or
               receivable from the Series Account Property are being applied as
               if there had not been such a

               declaration; then the Indenture Trustee shall, to the fullest
               extent practicable, invest and reinvest funds in the Series
               Accounts in the investment described in clause (g) of the
               definition of Eligible Investments.

         (h)   All Series Accounts will initially be established with the
               Indenture Trustee.

         (i)   The Indenture Trustee acknowledges that, pursuant to the
               provisions of the Class VPN Swap and the Class A-1 Swap, the Swap
               Counterparties may be required to post collateral with the
               Indenture Trustee to secure the Swap Counterparty's obligations
               under the related swap. The Indenture Trustee agrees to establish
               and maintain an Eligible Deposit Account to hold such collateral,
               if requested to do so by the Servicer. The Indenture Trustee
               further agrees to follow such written instructions relating to
               the administration of, and transfers from such account, as may be
               delivered by the Servicer.

5.7      RESERVE ACCOUNT

         (a)   On the Closing Date and on each Subsequent Transfer Date, the
               Issuer shall, as provided in Section 2.7(b), deposit the

               released from the Lien of the Indenture and the security interest

               such transferees and assignees) or the Issuer shall in no event
               thereafter be required to refund any such distributed amounts.

         (d)   On the first Monthly Payment Date on which the Outstanding Amount
               of the Series C2002-1 Debt Obligations is less than or equal to

               owing or to be distributed hereunder or under the Indenture to
               the Servicer, the Administrator, the Series C2002-1 Debtholders,
               the other Related Specified Creditors, the Trustee and the

               distributed to the Seller (or any transferee or assignee pursuant
               to clause (e)) and the Issuer as provided in subsection (b)
               above. The Seller (and such transferees and assignees) and the
               Issuer shall in no event be required to refund any amounts
               distributed pursuant to this Section 5.7(e) to which the Seller
               is entitled to hereunder.

         (f)   The Seller may at any time, without consent of the Series C2002-1

               this Agreement with respect to such transfer, instruct the
               Indenture Trustee in writing to withdraw from the Pre-Funding
               Account (i) an amount equal to the Reserve Account Initial
               Deposit for such Subsequent Transfer Date (which amount shall be
               retained by the Issuer and set-off against the Subordinated
               Reserve Account Loan to be made by the Seller to the Issuer on
               such date as provided in Section 2.7(b)) and to deposit such
               amount in the Reserve Account and (ii) an amount equal to the

               amount to or upon the order of the Seller.

         (c)   If: (i) the Pre-Funded Amount has not been reduced to zero on the
               Monthly Payment Date on which the Pre-Funding Period ends (or, if
               the Pre-Funding Period does not end on a Monthly Payment Date, on
               the first Monthly Payment Date following the end of the
               Pre-Funding Period) or (ii) the Pre-Funded Amount has been
               reduced to $100,000 or less on any Determination Date, in either
               case after giving effect to any reductions in the Pre-Funded
               Amount on such date pursuant to paragraph (a), the Servicer shall
               instruct the Indenture Trustee to withdraw from the Pre-Funding
               Account, in the case of clause (i), on such Monthly Payment Date
               or, in the case of clause (ii), on the Monthly Payment Date
               immediately succeeding such Determination Date, the amount
               remaining at the time in the Pre-Funding Account (such remaining
               amount being the "Remaining Pre-Funded Amount") and such amount
               shall be deposited to the Note Distribution Account.

Servicer, however, will account to the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee, Series

distributions and transfers were made individually.

               the Seller enforceable in accordance with their terms.

         (e)   No Violation. The consummation of the transactions contemplated
               by this Agreement and the fulfilment of the terms hereof do not
               conflict with, result in any breach of any of the terms and
               provisions of, or constitute (with or without notice or lapse of
               time or both) a default under, the articles of incorporation or
               by-laws of the Seller, or any indenture, agreement or other
               instrument to which the Seller is a party or by which it shall be
               bound; or result in the creation or imposition of any Lien upon
               any of its properties pursuant to the terms of any such
               indenture, agreement or other instrument (other than pursuant to

               pending or, to the best of the Seller's knowledge, threatened,
               before any court, regulatory body, administrative agency or other

                      this Agreement; or

               (iv)   the Servicer's failure to duly observe or perform in any
                      material respect its covenants and agreements set forth in
                      this Agreement.

         (c)   The Servicer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the
               Issuer, the Backup Servicer and the Indenture Trustee (and their
               respective officers, directors, employees and agents) from and
               against all costs, expenses, losses, claims, damages and
               liabilities arising out of or incurred in connection with the
               acceptance or performance of the trusts and duties herein and, in
               the case of the Issuer, in the Declaration of Trust contained,
               and, in the case of the Indenture Trustee, in the Indenture
               contained, except to the extent that such cost, expense, loss,
               claim, damage or liability:

               (i)    shall be due to the wilful misfeasance, bad faith or gross
                      negligence (except for errors in judgement) of the Issuer,
                      the Backup Servicer or Indenture Trustee, as applicable;
                      or

               (ii)   is a debt, liability or obligation of the Issuer to a
                      Specified Creditor in respect of a Series C2002-1 Note
                      Obligation or otherwise (other than pursuant to Sections
                      7.2(d), (e), or (f)).

         (d)   The Servicer shall pay any and all taxes levied or assessed upon
               all or part of the Related Collateral.

         (e)   The Servicer shall pay the Indenture Trustee and the Issuer from
               time to time reasonable compensation for all services rendered by
               the Indenture Trustee under the Indenture or the Issuer under the
               Declaration of Trust (which compensation shall not be limited by
               any provision of law in regard to the compensation of a trustee
               of an express trust).

         (f)   The Servicer shall, except as otherwise expressly provided in the
               Indenture or Declaration of Trust, reimburse the Indenture
               Trustee and the Issuer upon its request for all reasonable
               expenses, disbursements and advances incurred or made in
               accordance with the Indenture or Declaration of Trust
               respectively (including the reasonable compensation, expenses and
               disbursements of its agents and either in-house counsel or
               outside counsel, but not both), except any such expense,
               disbursement or advance as may be attributable to the Indenture
               Trustee's or Issuer's negligence, bad faith or wilful
               misfeasance.

         (g)   For purposes of this Section, in the event of the termination of
               the rights and obligations of Servicer pursuant to Section 8.1 or
               a resignation by such Servicer

<PAGE>

                                       44

               pursuant to this Agreement, the Servicer shall be deemed to be
               the Servicer pending appointment of a Successor Servicer pursuant
               to Section 8.2.

         (h)   Indemnification under this Section shall survive the resignation
               or removal of the Issuer, the Backup Servicer or the Indenture
               Trustee or the termination of this Agreement and shall include
               reasonable fees and expenses of counsel and expenses of
               litigation. If the Servicer shall have made any indemnity
               payments pursuant to this Section and the Person to or on behalf
               of whom such payments are made thereafter collects any of such
               amounts from others, such Person shall promptly repay such
               amounts to the Servicer, without interest.

         OBLIGATIONS OF, SERVICER OR BACKUP SERVICER

         (a)   Any Person (i) into which the Servicer may be amalgamated, merged
               or consolidated; (ii) that may result from any amalgamation,
               merger or consolidation to which the Servicer shall be a party;
               (iii) that may succeed to the properties and assets of the
               Servicer substantially as a whole; and (iv) that is (a) an
               Affiliate of the Seller, (b) a successor to the retail finance

               circumstances) executes an agreement of assumption to perform
               every obligation of the Servicer hereunder (or is deemed by law
               to have assumed such obligations), shall be the successor to the
               Servicer under this Agreement without further act on the part of
               any of the parties to this Agreement; provided, however, that (1)
               immediately after giving effect to such transaction, no Servicer
               Termination Event, and no event which, after notice or lapse of
               time, or both, would become a Servicer Termination Event shall
               have occurred and be continuing, (2) the Servicer shall have
               delivered to the Issuer, the Backup Servicer and Indenture
               Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel each
               stating that such consolidation, merger or succession and such
               agreement of assumption comply with this Section and that all
               conditions precedent, if any, provided for in this Agreement
               relating to such transaction have been complied with, (3) the
               Rating Agency Condition shall have been satisfied with respect to
               such transaction; and (4) the Servicer shall have delivered to
               the Issuer and Indenture Trustee an Opinion of Counsel either (A)
               stating that, in the opinion of such counsel, all financing
               statements, financing change statements, continuation statements
               and amendments thereto have been executed and filed that are
               necessary fully to preserve and protect the interest of the
               Issuer or Indenture Trustee, respectively, in the Receivables and
               reciting the details of such filings or (B) stating that, in the
               opinion of such counsel, no such action shall be necessary to
               preserve and protect such interests. Notwithstanding anything
               herein to the contrary, the execution of the foregoing agreement
               of assumption and compliance with clauses (1), (2), (3) and (4)
               above shall be conditions to the consummation of the transactions
               referred to in clauses (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) above.

                                       45

         (b)   Any corporation (i) into which the Backup Servicer may be merged
               or consolidated; (ii) resulting from any merger or consolidation
               to which the Backup Servicer shall be a party; (iii) which
               acquires by conveyance, transfer or lease substantially all of
               the assets of the Backup Servicer; or (iv) succeeding to the
               business of the Backup Servicer, in any of the foregoing cases
               shall execute an agreement of assumption to perform every
               obligation of the Backup Servicer under this Agreement and,
               whether or not such assumption agreement is executed, shall be
               the successor to the Backup Servicer under this Agreement without
               the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the
               part of any of the parties to this Agreement, anything in this
               Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding; provided, however,
               that nothing contained herein shall be deemed to release the
               Backup Servicer from any obligation.

7.4      LIMITATION ON LIABILITY OF SERVICER, THE BACKUP SERVICER AND OTHERS

         (a)   Neither the Servicer, the Backup Servicer nor any of their
               respective directors, officers, employees or agents shall be
               under any liability to the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee, the
               Series C2002-1 Debtholders or the other Related Specified
               Creditors, except as provided under this Agreement, for any
               action taken or for refraining from the taking of any action
               pursuant to this Agreement or for errors in judgement; provided,
               however, that this provision shall not protect the Servicer, the
               Backup Servicer or any such Person against any liability that
               would otherwise be imposed by reason of wilful misfeasance, bad
               faith or negligence in the performance of duties or by reason of
               reckless disregard of obligations and duties under this
               Agreement. The Servicer, the Backup Servicer and any director or
               officer or employee or agent of the Servicer or Backup Servicer
               may rely in good faith on any document of any kind prima facie
               properly executed and submitted by any Person acting on behalf of
               the Issuer or the Indenture Trustee respecting any matters
               arising hereunder.

         (b)   Except as provided in this Agreement, the Servicer and the Backup
               Servicer shall not be under any obligation to appear in,
               prosecute or defend any legal action that shall not be incidental
               to its duties to service the Receivables in accordance with this
               Agreement, and that in its opinion may involve it in any expense
               or liability; provided, however, that the Servicer or the Backup
               Servicer may undertake any reasonable action that it may deem
               necessary or desirable in respect of this Agreement, the other
               Basic Documents and the rights and duties of the parties to this
               Agreement, the other Basic Documents and the interests of the
               Series C2002-1 Debtholders and other Related Specified Creditors
               under this Agreement and the Indenture.

         (c)   The Backup Servicer shall not be liable for any obligation of the
               Servicer contained in this Agreement or for any errors of the
               Servicer contained in any computer tape, certificate or other
               data or document delivered to the Backup Servicer hereunder or on
               which the Backup Servicer must rely in order to perform its
               obligations hereunder, and the Indenture Trustee, the Issuer, the
               Seller and the Series C2002-1 Debtholders shall look only to the
               Servicer to perform such obligations. The Backup Servicer and the
               Indenture Trustee shall have no

<PAGE>

                                       46

               responsibility and shall not be in default hereunder or incur any
               liability for any failure, error, malfunction or any delay in
               carrying out any of their respective duties under this Agreement
               if such failure or delay results from the Backup Servicer acting
               in accordance with information prepared or supplied by a Person
               other than the Backup Servicer (or contractual agents) or the
               failure of any such other Person to prepare or provide such
               information. The Backup Servicer shall have no responsibility,
               shall not be in default and shall incur no liability for (i) any
               act or failure to act of any third party (other than its
               contractual agents), including the Servicer, (ii) any inaccuracy
               or omission in a notice or communication received by the Backup
               Servicer from any third party (other than its contractual
               agents), (iii) the invalidity or unenforceability of any
               Receivable under applicable law, (iv) the breach or inaccuracy of
               any representation or warranty made with respect to any
               Receivable, or (v) the acts or omissions of any successor Backup
               Servicer.

7.5      DELEGATION OF DUTIES

AmeriCredit Canada, as Servicer, may at any time appoint a sub-servicer (a
"Sub-Servicer") to perform all or any portion of its obligations as Servicer.
AmeriCredit Canada may appoint as a Sub-Servicer and delegate any of its duties
as Servicer to a direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of AmeriCredit Corp.
and the Rating Agencies need not approve any such delegation. The appointment of
any Sub-Servicer, other than an affiliate of AmeriCredit Corp., is subject to
the condition that the Rating Agencies confirm in writing that the appointment
of any Sub-Servicer will not result in the reduction or withdrawal of the
ratings of the Offered Notes. The Servicer may also at any time perform through
sub-contractors the specific duties of (i) repossession of Financed Vehicles,
(ii) tracking Financed Vehicles' insurance, and (iii) pursuing the collection of
deficiency balances on certain Liquidated Receivables, in each case without the
approval of the Rating Agencies. The Servicer shall remain obligated and be
liable to the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee, the Backup Servicer and the Series
C2002-1 Debtholders for the servicing and administering of the Receivables in
accordance with the Agreement without diminution of those obligations and
liabilities by virtue of the appointment of any Sub-Servicer or the delegation
of the specified duties and to the same extent and under the same terms and
conditions as if the Servicer itself were servicing and administering the
Receivables. The fees and expenses of each Sub-Servicer will be as agreed
between the Servicer and its Sub-Servicer, if any, from time to time and none of
the Issuer, the Trustee, the Indenture Trustee or the Series C2002-1 Debtholders
will have any responsibility therefor.

7.6      SERVICER AND BACKUP SERVICER NOT TO RESIGN

Subject to the provisions of Section 7.3, neither the Servicer nor the Backup
Servicer shall resign from the obligations and duties imposed on it as Servicer
or Backup Servicer under this Agreement except upon determination that the
performance of its duties under this Agreement shall no longer be permissible
under applicable law. Notice of any such determination shall be communicated to
the Issuer and the Indenture Trustee at the earliest practicable time (and, if
such communication is not in writing, shall be confirmed in writing at the
earliest practicable time) and any such determination shall be evidenced by an
Opinion of Counsel to such effect delivered to the Issuer and the Indenture
Trustee concurrently with or promptly after such notice. No resignation of the
Servicer shall become effective until the Backup Servicer or a Successor

<PAGE>

                                       47

Servicer shall have assumed the responsibilities and obligations of the Servicer
in accordance with Section 8.2. No resignation of the Backup Servicer shall
become effective until a Person that satisfies the Rating Agency Condition shall
have assumed the responsibilities and obligations of the Backup Servicer;
provided, however, that in the event a successor Backup Servicer is not
appointed within 60 days after the Backup Servicer has given notice of its
resignation and has provided the Opinion of Counsel required by this Section,
the Backup Servicer may petition a court for its removal.

7.7      REPAYMENT OF ADVANCES.

If the identity of the Servicer shall change, the predecessor Servicer shall be
entitled to receive, to the extent of available funds, reimbursement for
Liquidity Advances and Maturity Advances pursuant to Section 2.9 in the manner
specified in Section 2.9 with respect to all Liquidity Advances and Maturity
Advances made by such predecessor Servicer.

8.1      SERVICER TERMINATION EVENT

If any one of the following events (a "Servicer Termination Event") shall occur:

         (a)   any failure by the Servicer to deliver to the Issuer or the
               Indenture Trustee for distribution to the Series C2002-1
               Debtholders any proceeds or payment required to be so delivered
               that continues unremedied for a period of three Business Days
               (one Business Day with respect to payment of Purchase Amounts)
               after the earlier of written notice of such failure is received
               by the Servicer from the Issuer or the Indenture Trustee or after
               discovery of such failure by a Responsible Officer of the
               Servicer;

         (b)   failure by the Servicer to deliver to the Indenture Trustee the
               Servicer's Certificate by 12:00 p.m. (Toronto time) on any
               Determination Date;

         (c)   any failure by the Servicer duly to observe or to perform in any
               material respect any other covenants or agreements of the
               Servicer set forth in this Agreement or any other Basic Document,
               which failure shall (i) materially and adversely affect the
               rights of the Issuer or the Series C2002-1 Debtholders and the
               other Related Specified Creditors (determined without regard to
               the availability of funds from any credit enhancement in the form
               of the over-collateralization represented by the Class D Notes or
               in the form of the Reserve Account) and (ii) continues unremedied
               for a period of 30 days after the earlier of knowledge thereof by
               the Servicer or the date on which written notice of such failure,
               requiring the same to be remedied, shall have been given (A) to
               the Servicer by the Issuer or the Indenture Trustee or (B) to the
               Servicer and to the Issuer by the holders of not less than 25% of
               the Outstanding Amount of the Series C2002-1 Debt Obligations;

         (d)   an Insolvency Event occurs with respect to the Servicer;

<PAGE>

                                       48

         (e)   any representation, warranty or statement of the Servicer made in
               this Agreement or any certificate, report or other writing
               delivered pursuant hereto shall prove to be incorrect in any
               material respect as of the time when the same shall have been
               made, and the incorrectness of such representation, warranty or
               statement has a material adverse effect on the Issuer or the
               Series C2002-1 Debtholders and the other Related Specified
               Creditors (determined without regard to the availability of funds
               from any credit enhancement in the form of the
               over-collateralization represented by the Class D Notes or in the
               form of the Reserve Account) and, within 30 days after the
               earlier of knowledge thereof by the Servicer or after written
               notice thereof shall have been given to the Servicer by the
               Indenture Trustee or by the holders of the at least 25% of the
               outstanding principal amount of the Series C2002-1 Debt
               Obligations and the circumstances or condition in respect of
               which such representation, warranty or statement was incorrect
               shall not have been eliminated or otherwise cure; or

         (f)   if AmeriCredit Canada or an Affiliate is the Servicer, such
               Servicer shall cease to be a direct or indirect wholly owned
               subsidiary of AmeriCredit Corp.,

then, and in each and every case, so long as the Servicer Termination Event
shall not have been remedied, either the Indenture Trustee or the holders of not
less than 66-2/3% of the Outstanding Amount of the Series C2002-1 Debt
Obligations, by notice then given in writing to the Servicer (and to the
Indenture Trustee and Issuer if given by the Series C2002-1 Debtholders) may
terminate all the rights and obligations (other than the obligations set forth
in Section 7.2 hereof) of the Servicer under this Agreement. On or after the
receipt by the Servicer of such written notice, all authority and power of the
Servicer under this Agreement, whether with respect to the Series C2002-1 Debt
Obligations or the Receivables or otherwise, shall, without further action, pass
to and be vested in the Backup Servicer or such Successor Servicer as may be
appointed under Section 8.2; and, without limitation, the Backup Servicer or the
Successor Servicer is hereby authorized and empowered to execute and deliver, on
behalf of the predecessor Servicer, as attorney-in-fact or otherwise, any and
all documents and other instruments, and to do or accomplish all other acts or
things necessary or appropriate to effect the purposes of such notice of
termination, whether to complete the transfer and endorsement of the Receivables
and related documents, or otherwise. The predecessor Servicer shall co-operate
with the Backup Servicer or the Successor Servicer, the Indenture Trustee and
the Issuer in effecting the termination of the responsibilities and rights of
the predecessor Servicer under this Agreement, including the transfer to the
Backup Servicer or the Successor Servicer for administration by it of (i) all
cash amounts that shall at the time be held by the predecessor Servicer for
deposit, or shall thereafter be received by it with respect to a Receivable and
(ii) all Receivable Files, Monthly Records and Collection Records and a computer
tape in readable form as of the most recent Business Day containing all
information necessary to enable the Successor Servicer to service the
Receivables. All reasonable costs and expenses (including fees and disbursements
of counsel) incurred in connection with transferring the Receivable Files,
Monthly Records and Collection Records to the Backup Servicer or the Successor
Servicer and amending this Agreement to reflect such succession as Servicer
pursuant to this Section shall be paid by the predecessor Servicer. Upon receipt
of notice of the occurrence of a Servicer Termination Event, the Issuer shall
give notice thereof to the Rating Agencies.

         (a)   On and after the time the Servicer receives a notice of
               termination pursuant to Section 8.1(a) or upon the resignation of
               the Servicer pursuant to Section 7.6, the Backup Servicer shall
               be the successor in all respects to the Servicer in its capacity
               as servicer under this Agreement and the transactions set forth
               or provided for in this Agreement, and shall be subject to all
               the rights, responsibilities, restrictions, duties, liabilities
               and termination provisions relating thereto placed on the
               Servicer by the terms and provisions of this Agreement except as
               otherwise stated herein. The Indenture Trustee and such successor
               Servicer (the "Successor Servicer") shall take such action,
               consistent with this Agreement, as shall be necessary to
               effectuate any such succession. If a Successor Servicer is acting
               as Servicer hereunder, it shall be subject to termination under
               Section 8.1(a) upon the occurrence of any Servicer Termination
               Event applicable to it as Servicer.

         (b)   If the Backup Servicer shall be legally unable or unwilling to
               act as Servicer, the Backup Servicer, the Indenture Trustee or
               the holders of not less than a majority of the Outstanding Amount
               of the Series C2002-1 Debt Obligations may petition a court of
               competent jurisdiction to appoint any Eligible Servicer as
               Successor Servicer. Pending appointment pursuant to the preceding
               sentence, the Backup Servicer shall act as Successor Servicer
               unless it is legally unable to do so, in which event the outgoing
               Servicer shall continue to act as Servicer until a successor has
               been appointed and accepted such appointment. Subject to Section
               7.6, no provision of this Agreement shall be construed as
               relieving the Backup Servicer of its obligation to succeed as
               Successor Servicer upon the termination of the Servicer pursuant
               to Section 8.1(a) , or upon the resignation of the Servicer
               pursuant to Section 7.6. If upon the termination of the Servicer
               pursuant to Section 8.1(a) or the resignation of the Servicer
               pursuant to Section 7.6, the Indenture Trustee appoints a
               Successor Servicer other than the Backup Servicer, the Backup
               Servicer shall not be relieved of its duties as Backup Servicer
               hereunder.

         (c)   Any Successor Servicer shall be entitled to the Servicing Fee and
               such other compensation as described in Section 4.8 hereof. If
               any Successor Servicer is appointed as a result of the Backup
               Servicer's refusal (in breach of the terms of this Agreement) to
               act as Servicer although it is legally able to do so, the
               Indenture Trustee or the holders of not less than a majority of
               the Outstanding Amount of the Series C2002-1 Debt Obligations and
               such Successor Servicer may agree on reasonable additional
               compensation to be paid to such Successor Servicer by the Backup
               Servicer, which additional compensation shall be paid by such
               breaching Backup Servicer in its individual capacity and solely
               out of its own funds; provided, however, it being understood and
               agreed that the Indenture Trustee shall give prior notice to the
               Backup Servicer with respect to the appointment of such Successor
               Servicer and the payment of additional compensation, if any. If
               any Successor Servicer is appointed for any reason other than the
               Backup Servicer's refusal to act as Servicer although legally
               able to do so, the Backup Servicer shall not be liable for any
               Servicing Fee, additional

                                       50

               compensation or other amounts to be paid to such Successor
               Servicer in connection with its assumption and performance of the
               servicing duties described herein.

8.3      NOTIFICATION TO SERIES C2002-1 DEBTHOLDERS

Upon any termination of, or appointment of a successor to, the Servicer pursuant
to this Article 8, the Issuer shall give prompt written notice thereof to Series
C2002-1 Debtholders, the other Related Specified Creditors and the Rating
Agencies.

8.4      WAIVER OF PAST DEFAULTS

The Indenture Trustee or the holders of not less than a majority of the
Outstanding Amount of the Series C2002-1 Debt Obligations may, on behalf of all
Series C2002-1 Debtholders, waive in writing any default by the Servicer in the
performance of its obligations hereunder and its consequences. Upon any such
waiver of a past default, if such waiver so provides, such default shall cease
to exist, and any Servicer Termination Event arising therefrom shall be deemed
to have been remedied for every purpose of this Agreement. No such waiver shall
extend to any subsequent or other default or impair any right consequent
thereto.

                                   TERMINATION

9.1      OPTIONAL PURCHASE OF ALL RECEIVABLES

         (a)   On any Monthly Payment Date for which the Pool Balance, as of the
               last day of the Collection Period ended immediately prior to such
               Monthly Payment Date, is 10% or less of the Original Pool
               Balance, the Servicer and the Seller each shall have the option
               to purchase all of the Related Collateral, other than the Series
               Accounts, as of the first day of the Collection Period
               immediately preceding such Monthly Payment Date, for a purchase
               price (the "Optional Purchase Price") equal to the aggregate
               Purchase Amount for the Receivables plus the appraised value of
               any such other Related Collateral, such value to be determined by
               an appraiser mutually agreed upon by the Servicer, the Issuer and
               the Indenture Trustee; provided, however, that the Servicer or
               the Seller shall not be entitled to exercise such option unless,
               upon the exercise thereof as hereinafter provided, the Issuer
               shall have available funds sufficient to pay the Redemption Price
               of the Redeemable Debt Obligations to be redeemed on the
               Redemption Date therefor and to pay all accrued and unpaid
               Additional Class VPN Loan Amounts due and payable and all amounts
               under the Swap Agreements on such Redemption Date. To exercise
               such option, the Servicer or the Seller shall (i) give the Issuer
               and the Indenture Trustee notice of the exercise of such option
               not less than 10 days prior to the Monthly Payment Date on which
               such option is to be exercised and (ii) deposit in the Collection
               Account pursuant to Section 5.5 on such Monthly Payment Date an
               amount equal to the aggregate Purchase Amount for the Receivables
               (including Liquidated Receivables) plus the appraised value of
               any such other Related Collateral and shall succeed to all
               interests in, to and under the Related Collateral, other than the
               Series Accounts.

9.2      EVENT OF DEFAULT SALE.

Upon any sale or other disposition of the Related Collateral pursuant to Section
8.2 of the Indenture (an "Event of Default Sale"), the Servicer shall instruct
the Indenture Trustee to deposit the proceeds of such disposition (the "Event of
Default Proceeds") into the Collection Account.

                            MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

10.1     AMENDMENT

The Agreement may be amended from time to time by a written amendment duly
executed and delivered by the Seller, the Servicer, the Backup Servicer and the
Issuer, with the written consent of the Indenture Trustee, but without the
consent of any of the Series C2002-1 Debtholders or other Related Specified
Creditors, to cure any ambiguity, to correct or supplement any provisions in
this Agreement or for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any
manner or eliminating any of the provisions in this Agreement or of modifying in
any manner the rights of the Series C2002-1 Debtholders or other Related
Specified Creditors; provided, however, that such action shall not, as evidenced
by an Opinion of Counsel delivered to the Issuer and the Indenture Trustee,
adversely affect in any material respect the interests of any Series C2002-1
Debtholders or other Related Specified Creditor.

This Agreement may also be amended from time to time by the Seller, the
Servicer, the Backup Servicer and the Issuer, with the written consent of the
Indenture Trustee, but without the consent of any of the Series C2002-1
Debtholders or other Related Specified Creditors, to: (x) replace the Reserve

Condition is satisfied with respect thereto and the Class VPN Lenders consent
thereto, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or (y) add credit
enhancement for the benefit of any Class of Series C2002-1 Debt Obligations.

This Agreement may also be amended from time to time by the Seller, the
Servicer, the Backup Servicer and the Issuer, with the written consent of (a)
the Indenture Trustee, and (b) Series C2002-1 Debtholders or other Related
Specified Creditors holding Series C2002-1 Debt Obligations evidencing not less
than a majority of the Outstanding Amount for the purpose of adding any
provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of
this Agreement or of modifying in any manner the rights of the Series C2002-1
Debtholders or other Related Specified Creditors; provided, however, that no
such amendment shall: (a) increase or reduce in any manner the amount of, or
accelerate or delay the timing of, collections of payments on Receivables or
distributions that shall be required to be made for the benefit of the Series
C2002-1 Debtholders or other Related Specified Creditors or (b) reduce the

consent to any such amendment, in the case of (a) or (b), without the consent of
the holders of all the outstanding Series C2002-1 Debt Obligations or (c)
adversely affect the interests of any other Related Specified Creditor without
the consent of that affected Related Specified Creditor.

Promptly after the execution of any such amendment or consent (or, in the case
of the Rating Agencies, 10 days prior thereto), the Issuer shall furnish written
notification of the substance of such amendment or consent to the Indenture
Trustee and each of the Rating Agencies.

                                       52

It shall not be necessary for the consent of the Series C2002-1 Debtholders or
other Related Specified Creditors pursuant to this Section to approve the
particular form of any proposed amendment or consent, but it shall be sufficient
if such consent shall approve the substance thereof.

Prior to the execution of any amendment to this Agreement, the Issuer and the
Indenture Trustee shall be entitled to receive and rely upon: (i) an Opinion of
Counsel stating that the execution of such amendment is authorized or permitted
by this Agreement and that all conditions precedent to such execution and
delivery by the Issuer and the Indenture Trustee have been satisfied and (ii)
the Opinion of Counsel referred to in Section 10.2(i)(i). The Issuer and the
Indenture Trustee may, but shall not be obligated to, enter into any such
amendment that affects the Issuer's or the Indenture Trustee's, as applicable,
own rights, duties or immunities under this Agreement or otherwise.

10.2     PROTECTION OF TITLE TO RECEIVABLES AND THE RELATED COLLATERAL.

         (a)   Subject to the last sentence of this Section 10.2(a), the Seller
               and the Servicer shall execute and file such financing
               statements, Forms RG, assignments and other documents and cause
               to be executed, delivered and filed such financing statements,
               financing change statements, Forms UCC-1 or other statements,
               assignments and other documents (collectively, "Financing
               Statements") all at such times, in such manner and in such places
               as may be required by any applicable PPSA to fully preserve,
               maintain, and protect the right, title and interest of the Issuer
               and the interests of the Indenture Trustee in the Receivables,
               the other property sold hereunder, the Related Collateral and in
               the proceeds thereof. The Seller shall deliver (or cause to be
               delivered) to the Issuer and Indenture Trustee duplicate
               registered copies of, or filing receipts for, any document filed
               as provided above, as soon as available following such filing.
               The Issuer and the Indenture Trustee shall co-operate fully with
               the Seller and the Servicer in connection with the obligations
               set forth above and will execute any and all documents reasonably
               required to fulfil the intent of this paragraph.

         (b)   Neither the Seller nor the Servicer shall change its name,
               identity, or corporate structure in any manner that would, could,
               or might make any Financing Statement filed by the Seller or the
               Servicer in accordance with paragraph (a) above misleading or
               ineffective within the meaning of any PPSA, unless it shall have
               given the Issuer and Indenture Trustee at least five days' prior
               written notice thereof and shall have promptly filed appropriate
               Financing Statements amending or validating previously filed
               Financing Statements.

         (c)   Each of the Seller and the Servicer shall give the Issuer and the
               Indenture Trustee at least 60 days' prior written notice of any
               relocation of its chief executive office if, as a result of such
               relocation, the applicable provisions of the PPSA would require
               the filing of any amendment of any previously filed Financing
               Statement or of any new Financing Statement and shall promptly
               file any such amendment or Financing Statement.

                                       53

         (d)   The Servicer shall maintain accounts and records as to each
               Receivable accurately and in sufficient detail to permit: (i) the
               reader thereof to know at any time the status of such Receivable,
               including payments and recoveries made and payments owing (and
               the nature of each) and (ii) reconciliation between payments or
               recoveries on (or with respect to) each Receivable and the
               amounts from time to time deposited in the Collection Account in
               respect of such Receivable.

         (e)   The Servicer shall maintain its computer systems so that, from
               and after the time of sale under this Agreement of the
               Receivables, the Servicer's master computer records (including
               any backup archives) that refer to a Receivable shall indicate
               clearly the interest of the Issuer and the Indenture Trustee in
               such Receivable and that such Receivable is owned by the Issuer
               and has been pledged to the Indenture Trustee. Indication of the
               Issuer's and the Indenture Trustee's interest in a Receivable may
               be deleted from or modified on the Servicer's computer systems
               when, and only when, the related Receivable shall have been paid
               in full, repurchased by the Seller or purchased by the Servicer
               pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

         (f)   If at any time the Seller or the Servicer shall propose to sell,
               grant a security interest in, or otherwise transfer any interest
               in receivables to any prospective purchaser, lender or other
               transferee, the Servicer shall give to such prospective
               purchaser, lender or other transferee computer tapes, records or
               printouts (including any restored from backup archives) that, if
               they shall refer in any manner whatsoever to any Receivable,
               shall indicate clearly that such Receivable has been sold and is
               owned by the Issuer and has been pledged to the Indenture
               Trustee.

         (g)   The Seller shall not (i) create, incur or suffer to exist, or
               agree to create, incur or suffer to exist, or consent to cause or
               permit in the future (upon the happening of a contingency or
               otherwise) the creation, incurrence or existence of any Lien or
               restriction on transferability of the Receivables except for the
               Lien in favour of the Indenture Trustee for the benefit of the
               Series C2002-1 Debtholders and the restrictions on
               transferability imposed by this Agreement or (ii) sign or file
               under the PPSA of any jurisdiction any financing statement which
               names the Seller as a debtor, or sign any security agreement
               authorizing any secured party thereunder to file such financing
               statement, with respect to the Receivables, except in each case
               any such instrument solely securing the rights and interests of
               the Issuer or the rights and preserving the Lien of the Indenture
               Trustee, for the benefit of the Series C2002-1 Debtholders and
               the other Related Specified Creditors.

         (h)   The Servicer shall permit the Indenture Trustee and its agents at
               any time during normal business hours to inspect, audit and make
               copies of and abstracts from the Servicer's records regarding any
               Receivable provided, however that nothing in this Section 10.2
               shall affect the obligation of the Servicer to observe any
               applicable law prohibiting disclosure of information regarding
               the Obligors, and the failure of the Servicer to provide access
               to information as a result of such obligation shall not
               constitute a breach of this Section.

                                       54

         (i)   Upon request, the Servicer shall furnish to the Issuer or to the
               Indenture Trustee, within five Business Days, a list of all

               part of the Related Collateral, together with a reconciliation of
               such list to the Schedule of Receivables and to each of the
               Servicer's Certificates furnished before such request indicating

         (j)   The Servicer shall deliver to the Issuer and the Indenture
               Trustee:

                      necessary fully to preserve and protect the interest of
                      the Issuer and the Indenture Trustee in the Receivables
                      (except as otherwise contemplated by the last sentence of
                      Section 10.2(a)), and reciting the details of such filings
                      or referring to prior Opinions of Counsel in which such
                      details are given, or (B) stating that, in the opinion of
                      such counsel, no such action shall be necessary to
                      preserve and protect such interest; and

               (ii)   within 90 days after the beginning of each calendar year
                      beginning with the first calendar year beginning more than
                      three months after the Initial Cut-Off Date, an Opinion of
                      Counsel, dated as of a date during such 90-day period,
                      either: (A) stating that, in the opinion of such counsel,
                      all Financing Statements have been executed and filed that
                      are necessary fully to preserve and protect the interest
                      of the Issuer and the Indenture Trustee in the Receivables
                      (except as otherwise contemplated by the last sentence of
                      Section 10.2(a)), and reciting the details of such filings
                      or referring to prior Opinions of Counsel in which such
                      details are given, or (B) stating that, in the opinion of
                      such counsel, no such action shall be necessary to

               opinion) to be taken in the following year to preserve and
               protect such interest.

         made when due, shall fully amortize the Amount Financed over the
         original term, and (E) has not been amended or collections with respect
         to which waived, other than as evidenced in the Receivable File
         relating thereto.

2.       Schedule of Receivables. The information set forth on Schedule A to the

         party, which security interest is prior to all other Liens upon and
         security interests in such Financed Vehicle which now exist or may

<PAGE>

                                      - 2 -

         hereafter arise or be created (except, as to priority, for any lien for
         taxes, labour or materials affecting a Financed Vehicle). As of the
         related Cut-Off Date there were no Liens or claims for taxes, work,
         labour or materials affecting a Financed Vehicle which are or may be
         Liens prior or equal to the Liens of the related Receivable.

7.       Receivables in Force. No Receivable has been satisfied, subordinated or
         rescinded, nor has any Financed Vehicles been released from the Lien
         granted by the related Receivable in whole or in part.

8.       No Amendment or Waiver. No provision of a Receivable has been waived,

         has been asserted or threatened or exists with respect to any
         Receivable.

10.      No Default. No Receivable is a non-performing Receivable or has a
         payment that is more than 90 days overdue as of the related Cut-Off
         Date and, except for a payment default continuing for a period of not
         more than 90 days, no default, breach, violation or event permitting
         acceleration under the terms of any Receivable has occurred and is
         continuing; and no continuing condition that with notice or the lapse
         of time or both would constitute such a default, breach, violation or
         event permitting acceleration under the terms of any Receivable has
         arisen; and the Seller has not waived and shall not waive any of the
         foregoing.

11.      Title. No Receivable or portion thereof has been sold, transferred,
         assigned, conveyed or pledged by the Seller to any Person other than
         the Issuer. Immediately prior to the transfer and assignment herein
         contemplated, the Seller had good title to each Receivable, free and
         clear of all Liens, encumbrances, claims, security interests and rights
         of others and, immediately upon the transfer thereof, the Issuer shall
         have good title to each such Receivable, free and clear of all Liens,
         encumbrances, security interests and rights of others; and the transfer
         and assignment of the Receivables to the Issuer has been perfected,
         recorded or published, as the case may be, under the applicable PPSA.

12.      Lawful Assignment. No Receivable has been originated in, or is subject
         to the laws of, any jurisdiction under which the sale, transfer and
         assignment of such Receivable or any Receivable under this Agreement,
         the Purchase Agreement, or the Indenture is unlawful, void or voidable.

13.      All Filings Made. All filings (including PPSA filings) necessary in any
         all applicable jurisdictions necessary or desirable to give the Issuer
         a first priority perfected ownership and/or security interest in the
         Receivables and to give the Indenture Trustee a first priority
         perfected security interest therein have been made.

14.      One Original. There is only one original executed copy of each
         Receivable.

15.      No Default: There has been no default, breach, violation or event
         permitting acceleration under the terms of any Receivable (other than
         payment delinquencies of not more than 30 days), and no condition
         exists or event has occurred and is continuing that with notice,

<PAGE>

                                      - 3 -

         the lapse of time or both would constitute a default, breach, violation
         or event permitting acceleration under the terms of any Receivable, and
         there has been no waiver of any of the foregoing. As of the related
         Cut-Off Date no Financed Vehicle had been repossessed.

16.      Insurance. At the time of an origination of a Receivable by the Seller
         or a purchase of a Receivable by the Seller from a Dealer, each
         Financed Vehicle is required to be covered by a comprehensive and
         collision insurance policy (i) in an amount at least equal to the
         lesser of (a) its maximum insurable value or (b) the principal amount
         due from the Obligor under the related Receivable, (ii) naming
         AmeriCredit Canada as loss payee and (iii) insuring against loss and
         damage due to fire, theft, transportation, collision and other risks
         generally covered by comprehensive and collision coverage. Each
         Receivable requires the Obligor to maintain physical loss and damage
         insurance, naming AmeriCredit Canada and its successors and assigns as
         additional insured parties, and each Receivable permits the holder
         thereof to obtain physical loss and damage insurance at the expense of
         the Obligor if the Obligor fails to do so. No Financed Vehicle is
         insured under a policy of Force-Placed Insurance on the related Cut-Off
         Date.

17.      Remaining Principal Balance. At the related Cut-Off Date the Principal
         Balance of each Receivable set forth in the Schedule of Receivables is

         not more than 33%; (E) no Receivable was in a repossessed status and no
         related Obligor was the subject of any voluntary or involuntary
         bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding as of the related Cut-Off Date; (F)
         no Receivable was more than 60 days past due as of the related Cut-Off
         Date (and if any Receivable was past due as of the related Cut-Off
         Date, such Receivable was not one which caused the percentage of the
         Pool Balance, determined as of the Statistical Calculation Date (in the
         case of the Initial Receivables) and the related Cut-Off Date and,
         which is comprised of Receivables which are 31 to 60 days past due, to
         exceed 5%); and (G) no funds have been advanced by the Seller, any
         Dealer, or anyone acting on behalf of any of them in order to cause any
         Receivable to qualify under clause (F) above.

19.      No Bankruptcies. No Obligor on any Receivable as of the related Cut-Off
         Date was noted in the related Receivable File as being the subject of a
         bankruptcy proceeding.

20.      No Repossessions. None of the Financed Vehicles securing any Receivable
         is in repossession status.

         in the PPSA of the provincial law of which governs the perfection of
         the interest granted in it.

22.      Canadian Obligors. None of the Receivables is denominated and payable
         in any currency other than Canadian Dollars or is due from any Person
         that does not have a mailing address in one of the Provinces of Canada.

<PAGE>

                                      - 4 -

23.      Receivable Not Assumable. No Receivable is assumable by any other
         Person in a manner which would release the Obligor thereof from such
         Obligor's obligations to the Seller with respect to such Receivable.

24.      Marking Records. By the Closing Date, the Seller will have caused the
         portions of the Electronic Ledger relating to the Receivables to be
         clearly and unambiguously marked to show that the Receivables have been
         sold by the Seller to the Issuer in accordance with the terms of the
         Agreement.

25.      Computer Tape. The Computer Tape made available by the Seller to the
         Issuer on the Closing Date and on each Subsequent Transfer Date was
         complete and accurate as of the related Cut-off Date and includes a
         description of the same Receivables that are described in the Schedule
         of Receivables.

26.      Adverse Selection. No selection procedures adverse to the Series
         C2002-1 Debtholders were utilized in selecting the Receivables from
         those receivables owned by the Seller.

27.      Receivables Files Complete. There exists an Receivable File pertaining
         to each Receivable and such Receivable File contains (a) a fully
         executed original of the Receivable and (b) the original executed
         credit application, or a paper or electronic copy thereof. Each of such
         documents which is required to be signed by the Obligor has been signed
         by the Obligor in the appropriate spaces. All blanks on any form have
         been properly filled in and each form has otherwise been correctly
         prepared. The complete Receivable File for each Receivable currently is
         in the possession of the Custodian.

28.      No Impairment. The Seller has not done anything to convey any right to
         any Person that would result in such Person having a right to payments
         due under the Receivable or otherwise to impair the rights of the
         Issuer, the Indenture Trustee and the Series C2002-1 Debtholders in any
