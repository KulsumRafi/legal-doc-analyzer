</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding any provisions in this Plan to the contrary, each Option issued to Non-Insider Directors under Section 10 shall contain the following terms and conditions:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Term of Option.</B> The term of each Option commences on the date it is granted and, unless sooner terminated as set forth herein, expires on the date ("Expiration Date") ten years from the date of grant.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Termination of Service.</B> In the event that the services of a Non-Insider Director to whom a Non-Insider Director Option has been granted terminate for any reason or no reason, other than by reason of death or disability, such Option may be exercised (to the extent that the Non-Insider Director shall have been entitled to do so at the termination of his service) at any time within three months after such termination. To the extent that such Non-Insider Director was not entitled to exercise his Option at the time of his termination, or insofar as he does not exercise such Option to the extent he was entitled within the time specified herein, the Option shall itself terminate at the time of such termination. Notwithstanding any provision in this Section 11(b) to the contrary, the services of a Non-Insider Director shall not be deemed terminated if such Non-Insider Director subsequently becomes an Employee, Director or Consultant.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disability of Optionee.</B> Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 11(b) above, in the event a Non-Insider Director is unable to perform services as a Non-Insider Director for the benefit of the Corporation as a result of his total and permanent disability (as defined in Section 22(e)(3) of the Code), he may, but only within six months after termination due to such disability, exercise his Option to the extent he was entitled to exercise it at the date of such disability.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Death of Optionee.</B> In the event of the death of an Optionee who at the time of his death is a Non-Insider Director of the Corporation and who shall have continuously served as a Non-Insider Director since the date of grant of the Option, or with respect to an Optionee who was a Non-Insider Director within the preceding three months, the Option may be exercised, at any time within six months following the date of death, by the Optionee's estate or by a person who acquired the right to exercise the Option by bequest or inheritance, but only to the extent of the right to exercise that has accrued at the date of such termination or otherwise pursuant to the terms of the Stock Option Agreement.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No Extension.</B> Notwithstanding any provision in this Plan to the contrary, no Option granted to a Non-Insider Director under Section 9 shall terminate later than its original Expiration Date.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Non-Transferability of Options and Stock Purchase Rights.</B> The Options and Stock Purchase Rights may not be sold, pledged, assigned, hypothecated, transferred, or disposed of in any manner other than by will or by the laws of descent or distribution and may be exercised, during the lifetime of the Optionee or Purchaser, only by the Optionee or Purchaser, provided that the Board may grant a Nonstatutory Stock Option that is transferable to the extent provided in the Stock Option Agreement.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>13.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adjustments Upon Changes in Capitalization or Merger.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proportional Adjustments.</B> Subject to any required action by the Stockholders of the Corporation, the number of Shares covered by each outstanding Option and Stock Purchase Right, the number of Shares which have been authorized for issuance under the Plan but as to which no Options or Stock Purchase Rights have yet been granted or which have been returned to the Plan upon cancellation or expiration of an Option or Stock Purchase Right, and the maximum number of Shares subject to award to any person during any calendar year period pursuant to Section 5(e), as well as the price per Share covered by each such outstanding Option or Stock Purchase Right, shall be proportionately adjusted for any increase or decrease in the number of issued Shares resulting from a stock split, the payment of a stock dividend with respect to the stock, or any other increase or decrease in the number of issued Shares effected without receipt of consideration by the Corporation; <I>provided, however,</I> that conversion of any convertible securities of the Corporation shall not be deemed to have been "effected without receipt of consideration." Such adjustment shall be made by the Board, whose determination in that respect shall be final, binding and conclusive. Except as expressly provided herein, no issuance by the Corporation of shares of stock of any class, shall affect, and no adjustment by reason thereof shall be made with respect to, the number or price of Shares subject to an Option or Stock Purchase Right.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reorganization.</B> With respect to Options granted other than to Non-Insider Directors pursuant to Section 9, in the event of the proposed dissolution or liquidation of the Corporation, or in the event of a proposed sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation, or the merger of the Corporation with or into another corporation, at the sole discretion of the Board and to the extent permitted by applicable law: (i) any surviving corporation shall assume any Options outstanding under the Plan or shall substitute similar Options for those outstanding under the plan; (ii) such Options shall continue in full force and effect; or (iii) each Option held by an Optionee then performing services as an Employee, Director or Consultant will become fully exercisable with respect to all of the Shares subject to the Option prior to the consummation of such proposed action at such time as the Board in its discretion may determine and the Option terminated if not exercised prior to such event. The Board may also in its discretion require that all of the Shares purchased pursuant to the foregoing clause (iii) which would not otherwise be purchasable at such time except by operation of such clause (iii) shall be subject to a repurchase right of the Corporation (or its successor) which repurchase right shall expire at the same (or earlier) times and to the same (or greater) extent as such Shares would have become purchasable under the Option had the Option not become fully exercisable pursuant to clause (iii). For this purpose, the Board may require that the Optionee and the Corporation (or its successor) execute an agreement (in such form as determined by the Board) with respect to such Shares to reflect the Corporation's (or its successor's) repurchase right. If such Option is to be assumed or substituted, then such Option shall be appropriately adjusted to apply to the kind, class and number of securities or other property which would have been issuable to the Optionee in the consummation of such transaction had the Option been exercised immediately prior to such transaction and appropriate adjustments shall also be made to the price payable per share, provided that the aggregate Option price payable thereunder shall remain the same. With respect to Options granted to Non-Insider Directors pursuant to Section 9, in the event of the proposed dissolution or liquidation of the Corporation, or in the event of a proposed sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation, or the merger of the Corporation with or into another corporation, to the extent permitted by applicable law, each Option held by an Optionee then performing services as a Non-Insider Director will become fully exercisable with respect to all of the Shares subject to the Option immediately prior to the consummation of such proposed action and the Option terminated if not exercised prior to such event.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>14.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effectiveness of Plan. </B>The Plan became effective on January 22, 1987.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>16.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No Employee Contract.</B> The Plan shall not confer upon any holder of an Option or holder of a Stock Purchase Right any right with respect to continuation of employment by or the rendition of consulting or director services to the Corporation or any Affiliate of the Corporation, nor shall it interfere in any way with his right or the Corporation's or its Affiliates' (and in the case of directors, the Stockholders') right to terminate his employment or services as a Consultant or director at any time.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>17.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Withholding.</B> To the extent provided by the terms of a Stock Option Agreement or Stock Purchase Agreement, any Optionee or Purchaser may satisfy any federal, state or local tax withholding obligation relating to the purchase of Stock by any of the following means or by a combination of such means: (1) tendering a cash payment; (2) authorizing the Corporation to withhold from the Shares otherwise issuable to the purchaser a number of Shares having a fair market value less than or equal to the amount of the withholding tax obligation; or (3) delivering to the Corporation owned and unencumbered Shares having a fair market value less than or equal to the amount of withholding tax obligation.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment.</B> However, except as provided in Section 13(a) relating to adjustments upon changes in Stock, no amendment shall be effective unless approved by the Stockholders of the Corporation with respect to the stockholder approval required by Section 6(a) or otherwise to the extent stockholder approval is necessary to satisfy the requirements of Section 422(b) of the Code, to comply with the requirements of Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act, or to satisfy any Nasdaq or securities exchange listing requirements. The Board may, in its sole discretion, submit any other amendment to the Plan for Stockholder approval, including, but not limited to amendments to the Plan intended to satisfy the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder regarding the exclusion of performance-based compensation from the limit on corporate deductibility of compensation paid to certain executive officers.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>(c)</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is expressly contemplated that the Board may amend the Plan in any respect the Board deems necessary or advisable to provide Optionees with the maximum benefits provided or to be provided under the provisions of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder relating to employee Incentive Stock Options and/or to bring the Plan and/or Incentive Stock Options granted under it into compliance therewith.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>19.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Issuance of Shares.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Corporation shall not be required to issue Shares pursuant to the exercise of an Option or Stock Purchase Right unless the exercise of such Option or Stock Purchase Right and the issuance and delivery of such Shares pursuant thereto shall comply with all relevant provisions of law, including, without limitation, the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the Exchange Act, the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and the requirements of any Stock exchange upon which the Shares may then be listed, and shall be further subject to the approval of counsel for the Corporation with respect to such compliance; <I>provided, however,</I> that this provision shall not require the Corporation to register under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, either the Plan, any Option or Stock Purchase Right, or any Stock issued or issuable pursuant to such Option or Right.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>(b)</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a condition to the exercise of an Option or Stock Purchase Right, the Corporation may impose various conditions, including a requirement that the person exercising such Option represent and warrant, at the time of any such exercise, that the Shares are being purchased only for investment and without any present intention to sell or distribute such Shares.</P>

The inability of the Corporation to obtain authority from any regulatory body having jurisdiction, which authority is deemed by the Corporation's counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any Shares hereunder, shall relieve the Corporation of any liability in respect of the failure to issue or sell such Shares as to which such requisite authority shall not have been obtained.</P></FONT></BODY>
