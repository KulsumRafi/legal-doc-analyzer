permit any Permitted Lessee to) maintain, use, store, service,  repair, overhaul
or operate any  Aircraft or any Spare  Engine in material  violation of any law,
rule, regulation, treaty, order or certificate of any government or Governmental
Authority  (domestic  or foreign)  having  jurisdiction,  or in violation of any
airworthiness  certificate or material  violation of any license or registration
relating to such Aircraft or Spare Engine issued by any such  authority.  In the
event that any such law, rule, regulation,  treaty, order, certificate,  license
or registration requires alteration of any Aircraft or Spare Engine, the Company
will,  at its sole cost and  expense,  conform  thereto  or  obtain  conformance
therewith.  Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  the Company or any Permitted Lessee
may contest in good faith the  validity or  application  of any such law,  rule,
regulation,   treaty,  order,  certificate,   license  or  registration  in  any
reasonable  manner which does not  materially  adversely  affect the  Collateral
Agent,  the Board or any Lender,  or any of their  respective legal and economic
interests in or to any of the  Aircraft,  Spare  Engines or any Loan  Documents,
including the Lien of the Security  Documents.  In every case,  operation,  use,
storage,  maintenance,  servicing, repair or overhaul of the Aircraft is subject
to  compliance  by the  Company  with the  provisions  of Section  2.04.  If the
indemnities or insurance from the United States Government  specified in Section
2.04(g),  or some  combination  thereof in amounts equal to amounts  required by

                                       15
<PAGE>

Section  2.04(g),  have not been obtained  (unless  indemnities  or insurance in
amounts so required are available in the commercial  aviation  insurance  market
and are obtained),  the Company will not operate or locate any Aircraft or Spare
Engine,  or permit any Permitted Lessee or any other Person to operate or locate
any Aircraft or Spare  Engine,  in or to any area  excluded from coverage by any
insurance  required to be  maintained  by the terms of Section  2.04;  provided,
however,  that the failure of the Company to comply with the  provisions of this
Section  2.01(a)(ii)  shall  not give  rise to an Event of  Default  where  such
failure  is  attributable   to  a  hijacking,   medical   emergency,   equipment
malfunction, weather conditions,  navigational error or act of terrorism and the
Company (or such Permitted  Lessee, as the case may be) is taking all reasonable
steps to remedy such failure as soon as practicable.

     (iii)  Reregistration.  (A) So long as the Lien of the  Security  Documents
shall not have been  discharged  and no  Specified  Default  or Event of Default
shall  have  occurred  or be  continuing,  if  the  Company  has  requested  the
Collateral  Agent's  consent to  registration of any Aircraft in the name of the
Company (or, if appropriate,  in the name of a Permitted  Lessee as a "lessee"),
at the Company's own cost and expense,  under the laws of (1) any country listed
on Exhibit G with which the  United  States  then  maintains  normal  diplomatic
relations or, if Taiwan, the United States then maintains  diplomatic  relations
at least as good as those in effect on the Closing Date (a "Scheduled Country"),
or (2) any other  country  with which the  United  States  maintains  diplomatic
relations,  and the Collateral  Agent has  determined,  based on the information
contemplated   below,  that  the  laws  of  such  other  country  would  provide
substantially  equivalent  protection (including the right to take possession of
such Aircraft in the event of the  bankruptcy  of the Company or such  Permitted
Lessee,  if any) for the  rights of lenders  to that  enjoyed by the  Collateral
Agent under the  Security  Documents as provided  under  United  States law, the
Collateral  Agent will not  (subject to the terms of this  Section  2.01) in the
case of either  (1) or (2)  above,  unreasonably  withhold  its  consent to such
change of registration. Such consent shall only be given if the Collateral Agent
shall  have  received  reasonable  evidence  that  after  giving  effect to such
re-registration  the Collateral Agent shall possess a Lien and security interest
over such Aircraft with priority and perfection  (to the extent  perfection is a
relevant  concept  in such  country)  to  substantially  the same  extent  as is
available  under the  corresponding  laws of the United  States (it being agreed
that the lack of such  reasonable  evidence  shall  constitute  sole  reasonable
grounds to  withhold  such  consent  with  respect to a  Scheduled  Country or a
country mentioned in clause (2) above.

     (B) Prior to any such re-registration under the laws of a Scheduled Country
or the United States,  the Collateral Agent shall have received (1) an Officer's
Certificate  from the Company  certifying  that the  conditions  of this Section
2.01(a)(iii)  have been satisfied and (2) a favorable  opinion of counsel (which
opinion and counsel shall be reasonably  satisfactory  to the Collateral  Agent)
addressed  to the  Collateral  Agent to the effect  that (I) the laws of the new
country of  registration  will  recognize the Company's  right of ownership with
respect to such Aircraft and will give effect to the priority and perfection (to
the extent  perfection  is a relevant  concept in such  country) of the Lien and
security interest created by this Security Agreement (or the Company shall enter
into  such  other  instrument  as  shall be  necessary  to  convey  a valid  and
enforceable  first priority  perfected  security  interest (except for Permitted
Liens) to the  Collateral  Agent,  such  instrument  to be in form and substance
reasonably  satisfactory to the Collateral Agent),  (II) this Security Agreement
(or  such  other  instrument)  and the  Collateral  Agent's  Lien  and  right to

                                       16
<PAGE>

repossession  thereunder is valid and enforceable under the laws of such country
and (III) all filing,  recording  and other action  necessary to perfect (to the
extent perfection is a relevant concept in such country) and protect the Lien of
the  Security  Documents  (or other such  instrument)  in such new  jurisdiction
either has been accomplished prior to such change in the country of registry or,
if  such  opinion  cannot  under   applicable  law  be  given  at  the  time  of
registration,  are  specified  in such  opinion  and the Company  undertakes  to
accomplish such filing, recording or other action as soon as practicable (but in
any event no later than five (5)  Business  Days)  after  giving  effect to such
change in  registry  (in which case a further  opinion  shall be received by the
Collateral Agent  immediately  thereafter to the effect that all such recording,
filing and other action have been accomplished).

     (C) Prior to any such  re-registration  under the laws of any country other
than the U.S. or a Scheduled  Country,  the Collateral Agent shall have received
(1) an Officer's  Certificate from the Company certifying that the conditions of
this Section  2.01(a)(iii)  have been  satisfied and (2) a favorable  opinion of
counsel  (which  opinion and counsel  shall be  reasonably  satisfactory  to the
Collateral  Agent) in the new jurisdiction of registry  covering the matters set
forth in the preceding paragraph and addressed to it, and to the effect that (I)
the terms (including,  without limitation, the governing law, service of process
and jurisdictional submission provisions thereof) of this Security Agreement (or
such other  instrument)  are  legal,  valid,  binding  and  enforceable  in such
jurisdiction, (II) that it is not necessary for the Collateral Agent to register
or  qualify to do  business  in such  jurisdiction,  (III) that there is no tort
liability of the lender of an aircraft or engine not in possession thereof under
the laws of such  jurisdiction  other than tort liability  which might have been
imposed on such lender under the laws of the United  States or any state thereof
(it being understood that, such opinion shall be waived if insurance  reasonably
satisfactory to Collateral Agent is provided, at the Company's expense, to cover
such risk),  (IV)  (unless the  Company  shall have agreed to provide  insurance
covering  the  risk of  requisition  of use or  title  of such  Aircraft  by the
government of such jurisdiction so long as such Aircraft is registered under the
laws of such  jurisdiction)  that the  laws of such  jurisdiction  require  fair
compensation by the government of such  jurisdiction  payable in currency freely
convertible  into  Dollars for the loss of use or title of such  Aircraft in the
event of the  requisition  by such  government  of such use or  title,  (V) if a
Permitted Lease is then in effect,  the laws of the new jurisdiction of registry
do not provide the Permitted Lessee or any third party  possessory  rights which
would,  upon the  Company's  bankruptcy  or insolvency or other Event of Default
(assuming that at such time the Permitted  Lessee is not subject to a proceeding
or final order under applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization laws of
such  jurisdiction),  prevent the return of such Aircraft in accordance with the
terms of this Security  Agreement (or such other instrument) (such opinion to be
subject to customary  qualifications  and exceptions in the relevant domicile of
the Permitted Lessee but only to the extent that they do not deny the Collateral
Agent the  practical  realization  of its rights and  benefits  pursuant to this
Security Agreement (or such other instrument)),  and (VI) to such further effect
with  respect  to such  other  matters as the  Collateral  Agent may  reasonably
request.

     (D) In  addition  to the  opinion  contemplated  above,  prior  to any such
re-registration under the laws of any country other than the U.S. or a Scheduled
Country,  the  Collateral  Agent  shall  have  received  assurances,  reasonably
satisfactory  to it, to the effect  that (1) the  insurance  provisions  of this
Security  Agreement  will have been  complied  with after giving  effect to such
change of registry, (2) the original indemnities (and any additional indemnities
for which the  Company  is then  willing to enter  into a binding  agreement  to

                                       17
<PAGE>

indemnify)  in favor of the  Collateral  Agent,  the Board,  the Lenders and the
Participants  under the Loan Agreement afford each such party  substantially the
same  protection as provided  prior to such change of registry,  (3) such change
will not result in the  imposition of, or increase in the amount of, any Tax for
which the Company is not required to indemnify,  or is not then willing to enter
into a binding  agreement to indemnify,  the Collateral  Agent,  the Board,  the
Lenders  or the  Participants  and (4)  such new  country  of  registry  imposes
aircraft  maintenance  standards not materially less stringent than those of the
FAA or the Civil  Aviation  Authority of the United  Kingdom,  France,  Germany,
Japan or Canada.

     (E) In connection with any such re-registration,  the Company shall, at its
cost  and to the  extent  permitted  by the  laws of  such  country,  cause  the
interests of the  Collateral  Agent in such  Aircraft to be duly  registered  or
recorded under the laws of such country and at all times thereafter to remain so
duly  registered or recorded  unless and until changed as provided  herein,  and
shall,  at its sole  cost and  expense,  cause to be done at all times all other
acts (including the filing, recording and delivery of any document or instrument
and the  payment of any sum)  necessary  or, by  reference  to prudent  industry
practice in such country, advisable in order to establish the Collateral Agent's
interest in and to such Aircraft as against the Company, any Permitted Lessee or
any third parties in such jurisdiction.

     (F) The  Collateral  Agent shall  execute  and  deliver,  at the  Company's
expense,  all such documents as the Company may reasonably request and otherwise
cooperate  with the  Company  for the purpose of  effecting,  continuing  or (as
provided  in  this  Section  2.01(a)(iii))  changing  the  registration  of such
Aircraft as may be permissible hereunder.

     (G)  The  Company  shall  pay  all  reasonable  fees  and  expenses  of the
Collateral  Agent,  the Board or any  Lender in  connection  with any  change of
registry of any Aircraft.

     (b) Possession and Permitted Leases.  (i) The Company will not, without the
prior written consent of the Collateral Agent,  lease or otherwise in any manner
deliver, transfer or relinquish possession of any Airframe, Engine, Propeller or
any Spare Engine or install or permit any Engine,  Propeller or any Spare Engine
to be installed on any airframe  other than an Airframe;  provided that, so long
as (x) no  Specified  Default or Event of Default  shall  have  occurred  and be
continuing at the time of such lease,  delivery,  transfer or  relinquishment of
possession or installation  and (y) such action shall not deprive the Collateral
Agent of the first  priority  perfected  Lien of the  Security  Documents on any
Aircraft, any Airframe,  any Engine,  Propeller or any Spare Engine, the Company
(or, except with respect to subparagraph (H) below,  any Permitted  Lessee) may,
without the prior written consent of Collateral Agent:

     (A)  subject the  Airframes,  the  Engines,  the  Propellers  or engines or
propellers  then installed  thereon and the Spare Engines to normal  interchange
agreements  or any Engine,  Propeller or any Spare  Engine to normal  pooling or
similar arrangements, in each case customary in the airline industry and entered
into by the  Company (or any  Permitted  Lessee) in the  ordinary  course of its
business;  provided,  that (1) no such agreement or arrangement  contemplates or
requires the transfer of title to any Airframe, any Engine, any Propeller or any
Spare  Engine,  (2) if the  Company's  title to any  Airframe,  any Engine,  any
Propeller  or any Spare  Engine  shall be divested  under any such  agreement or

                                       18
<PAGE>

arrangement,  such  divestiture  shall be  deemed  to be an  Event of Loss  with
respect to such Airframe,  Engine, Propeller or Spare Engine, as applicable, and
the Company shall (or shall cause any  Permitted  Lessee to) comply with Section
3.01 hereof in respect thereof and (3) no such Airframe interchange  arrangement
shall  (I)  be for a  period  in  excess  of 5  days  or  (II)  result  in  such
Certificated  Air  Carrier,  Permitted  Lessee  or other  approved  air  carrier
obtaining possessory rights for a period in excess of 5 days with respect to, or
a Lien on, any  Airframe,  Engines,  Spare  Engines,  Propellers,  engine(s)  or
propeller(s) then installed on such Airframe;

     (B) deliver  possession of any Airframe,  any Engine,  any Propeller or any
Spare  Engine to the  Manufacturer  thereof or to any other  Person for testing,
service,  repair,  maintenance or overhaul work on such  Airframe,  such Engine,
such  Propeller or such Spare Engine or any part thereof or for  alterations  or
modifications in or additions to such Airframe,  such Engine,  such Propeller or
such Spare Engine to the extent required or permitted by the terms hereof;

     (C) install an Engine,  a Propeller or Spare Engine on an airframe owned by
the Company (or any Permitted  Lessee)  which  airframe is free and clear of all
Liens,  except:  (1)  Permitted  Liens and those which apply only to the engines
(other than  Engines or Spare  Engines),  propellers  (other  than  Propellers),
Appliances,  parts,  instruments,  appurtenances,  accessories,  furnishings and
other  equipment  (other than Parts)  installed on such airframe (but not to the
airframe as an  entirety),  (2) the rights of third  parties  under  interchange
agreements  which  would be  permitted  under  clause (A) above,  provided  that
Company's title to such Engine,  Propeller or Spare Engine shall not be divested
as a  result  thereof  and (3)  mortgage  Liens  or  other  security  interests,
provided,  that (as  regards  this clause  (3)),  such  mortgage  Liens or other
security  interests  effectively  provide that such  Engine,  Propeller or Spare
Engine  shall  not  become  subject  to the Lien of such  mortgage  or  security
interest, notwithstanding the installation thereof on such airframe;

     (D) install an Engine,  Propeller or Spare Engine on an airframe  leased to
the  Company  (or any  Permitted  Lessee) or  purchased  by the  Company (or any
Permitted  Lessee)  subject to a conditional  sale or other security  agreement,
provided that (1) such airframe is free and clear of all Liens,  except: (x) the
rights  of the  parties  to the  lease or  conditional  sale or  other  security
agreement covering such airframe, or their assignees,  and (y) Liens of the type
permitted by  subparagraph  (C) of this Section  2.01(b)(i)  and (2) such lease,
conditional  sale or other  security  agreement  effectively  provides that such
Engine,  Propeller or Spare Engine shall not become  subject to the Lien of such
lease,  conditional  sale  or  other  security  agreement,  notwithstanding  the
installation thereof on such airframe;

     (E) install an Engine,  Propeller or Spare  Engine on an airframe  owned by
the Company (or any Permitted  Lessee),  leased to the Company (or any Permitted
Lessee) or  purchased  by the Company  (or any  Permitted  Lessee)  subject to a
conditional sale or other security agreement under  circumstances  where neither
subparagraph (C) nor subparagraph (D) of this Section  2.01(b)(i) is applicable,
provided that any divestiture of title to such Engine, Propeller or Spare Engine
resulting from such  installation  shall be deemed an Event of Loss with respect
to such Engine,  Propeller or Spare Engine and the Company shall (or shall cause

                                       19
<PAGE>

any Permitted  Lessee to) comply with Section 3.01(b) hereof in respect thereof,
the Collateral  Agent not intending hereby to waive any right or interest it may
have to or in such Engine,  Propeller or Spare Engine under applicable law until
compliance by the Company with such Section 3.01(b);

     (F) transfer (or permit any Permitted Lessee to transfer) possession of any
Airframe,  Engine, Propeller or any Spare Engine to the United States of America
or any instrumentality or agency thereof pursuant to the Civil Reserve Air Fleet
Program  so long as the  Company  (or any  Permitted  Lessee)  shall  notify the
Collateral  Agent (1) prior to  transferring  possession  of any such  Airframe,
Engine,  Propeller or any such Spare  Engine to the United  States of America or
any agency or  instrumentality  thereof  pursuant to the Civil Reserve Air Fleet
Program  and  (2) of  the  name  and  the  address  of  the  Contracting  Office
Representative  for the Air Mobility  Command of the United  States Air Force to
whom notice must be given pursuant to Section 4.01(a) hereof;

     (G) transfer  possession  of any Airframe,  Engine,  Propeller or any Spare
Engine to the United States of America or any  instrumentality or agency thereof
pursuant  to a lease,  contract  or other  instrument,  a copy of which shall be
provided to the Collateral Agent; or

     (H) the Company may, at any time so long as no  Specified  Default or Event
of Default  shall have  occurred  and be  continuing,  enter into a lease of any
Aircraft  or any Spare  Engine  with (1) a  Certificated  Air  Carrier,  (2) any
airline  domiciled  and  principally  located  in a country  listed on Exhibit F
hereto,  or (3) any other Person  approved in writing by the  Collateral  Agent;
provided  that (I) no such lease shall be  permitted to a lessee that is subject
to a  proceeding  or final  order under  applicable  bankruptcy,  insolvency  or
reorganization laws on the date the lease is entered into, (II) in the case of a
lease under subclause (2) or (3) above, on the date of such lease or any renewal
or extension thereof,  the United States and the country in which such lessee is
domiciled and  principally  located  maintain  diplomatic  relations  (which for
purposes of this clause (H) shall  include  Taiwan and any other country that is
similarly  situated),  (III) in the case  only of a lease  to any  Person  under
subclause (3) above,  the Collateral Agent receives at the time of such lease an
opinion of counsel  (in form and from  counsel  reasonably  satisfactory  to the
Collateral Agent) to the effect that (w) the terms of the proposed lease will be
legal, valid,  binding and (subject to customary  exceptions in foreign opinions
generally)  enforceable in accordance with its terms against the proposed lessee
in the country in which the  proposed  lessee is  principally  based,  (x) there
exist no  possessory  rights in favor of the lessee  under such lease  under the
laws of such  lessee's  country of  domicile  that  would,  upon  bankruptcy  or
insolvency  of or other  default by the Company  and  assuming at such time such
lessee is not insolvent or bankrupt,  prevent the return or repossession of such
Aircraft or such Spare Engine in accordance with the lease and when permitted by
the terms of Section 4 upon the exercise by the Collateral Agent of its remedies
pursuant  to such  Section,  (y) the laws of such  lessee's  country of domicile
require fair  compensation  by the  government of such  jurisdiction  payable in
currency freely convertible into Dollars for the loss of use of such Aircraft or
such Spare Engine in the event of the  requisition  by such  government  of such
use,  and (z) in the  case of an  Airframe  or  Spare  Engine,  the laws of such
lessee's  country of domicile would give  recognition to the Company's  title to

                                       20
<PAGE>

the  applicable  Aircraft of which such Airframe is a part or such Spare Engine,
to the registry of the  applicable  Aircraft of which such Airframe is a part or
such Spare Engine (if such country maintains a registry for engines) in the name
of the Company (or the proposed lessee, as "lessee", as appropriate), and to the
Lien of the  Security  Documents,  (IV) if the  lessee  under  such  lease  is a
governmental  entity,  such lessee has waived all rights of sovereign  immunity,
and (V) if the lessee is a  Certificated  Air Carrier  and the  Aircraft or such
Spare Engine was first  placed in service  after  October 22, 1994,  the Company
will be entitled as lessor to the  benefits  of Section  1110 of the  Bankruptcy
Code with  respect to such  Aircraft or such Spare Engine in  connection  with a
proceeding  under Chapter 11 of the  Bankruptcy  Code in which the lessee is the
debtor.

     (ii) The rights of any Permitted Lessee or other  transferee  (other than a
transferee where the transfer is of an Engine, a Propeller or Spare Engine which
is to be an Event of Loss)  shall  be (and  the  sublease,  assignment  or other
transfer  document  under which such  transfer  or  sublease  is governed  shall
explicitly  provide  that)  during the period of such  possession,  subject  and
subordinate to, all the terms of the Security Documents (and any Permitted Lease
shall expressly state that it is so subject and subordinate), including, without
limitation,  the covenants contained in this Article 2, including the inspection
rights  contained in Section 2.05 and the Collateral  Agent's right to repossess
such  Aircraft or such Spare  Engine and to avoid and  terminate  any lease upon
such  repossession,  and the  Company  shall  remain  primarily  liable  for the
performance of all of the terms of the Security Documents,  and the terms of any
such  Permitted  Lease shall not permit any Permitted  Lessee to take any action
not permitted to be taken by the Company in the Security  Documents with respect
to such Aircraft or such Spare Engine. No pooling agreement,  Permitted Lease or
other relinquishment of possession of any Airframe, any Engine, any Propeller or
any Spare  Engine shall in any way  discharge  or diminish any of the  Company's
obligations to the Collateral Agent under the Security Documents or constitute a
waiver of Collateral  Agent's rights or remedies  hereunder or  thereunder.  The
Collateral  Agent  agrees,  for the  benefit of the Company  (and any  Permitted
Lessee)  and for the  benefit  of any  mortgagee  or other  holder of a security
interest  in any engine or  propeller  owned by the  Company  (or any  Permitted
Lessee),  any lessor of any engine  (other than an Engine) or  propeller  (other
than a  Propeller)  leased to the  Company  (or any  Permitted  Lessee)  and any
conditional  vendor of any  engine  (other  than an Engine or Spare  Engine)  or
propeller  (other than a Propeller)  purchased by the Company (or any  Permitted
Lessee) subject to a conditional sale agreement or any other security agreement,
that no interest shall be created under this Security Agreement in any engine or
propeller so owned,  leased or purchased and that neither the  Collateral  Agent
nor its successors or assigns will acquire or claim,  as against the Company (or
any Permitted  Lessee) or any such  mortgagee,  lessor or conditional  vendor or
other holder of a security interest or any successor or assignee of any thereof,
any right,  title or interest in such engine or  propeller as the result of such
engine or propeller being  installed on any Airframe.  The Company shall provide
the  Collateral  Agent with a copy of any Permitted  Lease having a term of more
than one (1) year upon entering into such Permitted Lease.

     (iii) In connection with any Permitted Lease, all necessary action shall be
taken by the Company at its expense which is required to continue the Collateral
Agent's security interest in the Aircraft,  Airframes,  Engines,  Propellers and
Spare Engines,  and such Permitted Lease and all other necessary documents shall

                                       21
<PAGE>

be duly filed,  registered or recorded in such public offices as may be required
to fully preserve the priority of the security  interest of the Collateral Agent
in the Aircraft, Airframes, Engines, Propellers and Spare Engines.

     (iv)  Any  Wet  Lease  shall  not   constitute  a  delivery,   transfer  or
relinquishment  of possession  for purposes of this Section 2.01. The Collateral
Agent   acknowledges  that  any  consolidation  or  merger  of  the  Company  or
conveyance,  transfer  or lease  of all or  substantially  all of the  Company's
assets, in each case as permitted by the Loan Documents, shall not be prohibited
by this Section 2.01.

     (v) No Permitted  Lease entered into pursuant to this Section 2.01(b) shall
permit any subleasing of any Aircraft or any Spare Engine.

     (c)  Insignia.  Within  ninety (90) days after (x) the  Closing  Date (with
respect  to  Aircraft,  Engines  and Spare  Engines  covered  by the Lien of the
Security  Documents  as of the  Closing  Date),  and (y) the date on  which  any
Security  Agreement   Supplement   (Aircraft),   Security  Agreement  Supplement
(Engine/Propeller)  or Security Agreement Supplement (Spare Engine) is delivered
(with  respect  to such  additional  Collateral),  and so long as any  Aircraft,
Engines or Spare Engines are subject to the Lien of the Security Documents,  the
Company agrees to affix and maintain (or cause to be affixed and  maintained) in
the cockpit of each Airframe adjacent to the registration  certificate  therein,
on each Engine and on each Spare Engine a nameplate bearing the inscription:

                     "THIS [AIRCRAFT/ENGINE] IS MORTGAGED TO
                                 CITIBANK, N.A.
 AS COLLATERAL AGENT, FOR THE BENEFIT AND SECURITY OF THE AIR TRANSPORTATION
             STABILIZATION BOARD, THE LENDERS AND THE PARTICIPANTS"

     (such nameplate to be replaced,  if necessary,  with a nameplate reflecting
the name of any successor  collateral agent, in each case as permitted under the
Loan Documents).  Except as above provided,  the Company will not allow the name
of any Person other than the Company to be placed on any  Airframe,  any Engine,
any Propeller or on any Spare Engine as a designation  that might be interpreted
as a claim of ownership or of any rights therein.

     (d) Substitution of Engines/Propellers. The Company may at any time, at its
sole cost and  expense,  replace any Engine,  any  Propeller or any Spare Engine
subjected  to the Lien hereof by causing an  Acceptable  Alternate  Engine or an
Acceptable Alternate  Propeller,  as the case may be, to be substituted for such
Engine,  Propeller or Spare Engine,  as the case may be, hereunder in accordance
with the provisions of Section  3.01(b) hereof to the same extent as if an Event
of Loss has occurred with respect to such Engine,  such  Propeller or such Spare
Engine.

     (e) Additional Aircraft-related Collateral. The Company may at any time, at
its sole cost and expense, subject additional airframes,  engines and propellers
to the Lien of the Security  Documents by entering into any one or more Security
Agreement  Supplements and otherwise complying with the terms of Section 5.14 of
the Loan Agreement with respect to such additional collateral.

     (a) Replacement of Parts.  The Company,  at its own cost and expense,  will
promptly  replace or cause to be replaced  all Parts which may from time to time
become worn out, lost, stolen, destroyed,  seized,  confiscated,  damaged beyond
repair or permanently  rendered unfit for use for any reason whatsoever,  except
as otherwise  provided in Section 2.02(c).  All replacement Parts shall be owned
by the Company  free and clear of all Liens  (except  Permitted  Liens,  pooling
arrangements   permitted  by  Section  2.02(b)  hereof  and  replacement   Parts
temporarily  installed  on an  emergency  basis)  and  shall  be in as  good  an
operating  condition  as, and shall have a value and  utility at least equal to,
the Parts replaced assuming such replaced Parts were in the condition and repair
required to be  maintained  by the terms  hereof.  All Parts at any time removed
from any  Airframe,  any Engine,  any Propeller or any Spare Engine shall remain
the property of the Company and subject to the Lien of the  Security  Documents,
no matter  where  located,  until such time as such Parts  shall be  replaced by
Parts which meet the  requirements  for  replacement  Parts  specified  above as
certified to the Collateral Agent by an Officer's  Certificate from the Company.
Immediately upon any replacement  Part becoming  incorporated or installed in or
attached to any Airframe, any Engine, any Propeller or any Spare Engine, without
further  act  (subject  only to  Permitted  Liens  and any  pooling  arrangement
permitted by Section 2.02(b) hereof and except any replacement  Part temporarily
installed on an emergency  basis),  (i) such  replacement  Part shall become the
property of the Company and subject to the Lien of the Security Documents and be
deemed a Part for all purposes  hereof to the same extent as the Part originally
incorporated  or installed in or attached to such  Airframe,  such Engine,  such
Propeller  or such  Spare  Engine and (ii) the  replaced  Part shall be free and
clear of all rights of the Collateral Agent and shall no longer be deemed a Part
or Spare Part hereunder.

     (b) Pooling of Parts. Any Part removed from any Airframe,  any Engine,  any
Propeller  or any Spare  Engine as  provided  in Section  2.02(a)  hereof may be
subjected by the Company (or any Permitted  Lessee) to a pooling  arrangement of
the type  which  is  permitted  by  clause  (A) of  Section  2.01(b)(i)  hereof;
provided,  that the Part  replacing such removed Part shall be  incorporated  or
installed in or attached to such Airframe,  Engine, Propeller or Spare Engine in
accordance with Section 2.02(a) as promptly as practicable  after the removal of
such removed  Part.  In addition,  any  replacement  Part when  incorporated  or
installed  in or  attached to an  Airframe,  an Engine,  a Propeller  or a Spare
Engine in  accordance  with such Section may be owned by any third party subject
to such a pooling  arrangement,  provided,  that the Company  (or any  Permitted
Lessee),  at its expense,  as promptly  thereafter  as  practicable,  either (i)
causes  such  replacement  Part to become  subject  to the Lien of the  Security
Documents,  free and  clear of all  Liens  other  than  Permitted  Liens or (ii)
replaces  such  replacement  Part with a further  replacement  Part owned by the
Company (or any Permitted Lessee) which shall become the property of the Company
and subject to the Lien of the Security  Documents,  free and clear of all Liens
other than Permitted Liens.

     (c)  Alterations,  Modifications  and  Additions.  The Company,  at its own
expense,  will make (or cause to be made) such alterations and  modifications in
and additions to the Airframes,  Engines, Propellers and Spare Engines as may be
required  to be made  from  time to time so as to  comply  with any  law,  rule,
regulation  or order of any  regulatory  agency or body of any  jurisdiction  in
which any Aircraft may then be registered;  provided,  however, that the Company

                                       23
<PAGE>

or any  Permitted  Lessee  may, in good faith,  and by  appropriate  proceedings
contest the validity or application  of any such law, rule,  regulation or order
in any  reasonable  manner  which  does  not  materially  adversely  affect  the
Collateral  Agent,  the Board or any Lender or any of their respective legal and
economic interests in or to such Airframe, Engine, Propeller or Spare Engine, or
subject any such Person to risk of any material civil or any criminal  penalties
or involve any material risk of loss or  forfeiture  of title to such  Aircraft,
Engine,  Propeller  or such Spare  Engine.  In  addition,  the  Company  (or any
Permitted  Lessee),  at its  own  expense,  may  from  time to  time  make  such
alterations and modifications in and additions to any Airframe,  any Engine, any
Propeller or any Spare Engine as the Company (or any Permitted  Lessee) may deem
desirable  in the proper  conduct of its  business,  including  removal of Parts
which the Company (or any  Permitted  Lessee)  deems to be obsolete or no longer
suitable or appropriate for use on such Airframe, such Engine, such Propeller or
such  Spare  Engine  (such  parts,  "Obsolete  Parts");  provided  that  no such
alteration,   modification,   removal  or  addition  impairs  the  condition  or
airworthiness  of such  Airframe,  such  Engine,  such  Propeller  or such Spare
Engine,  or materially  diminishes the value or utility of such  Airframe,  such
Engine, such Propeller or such Spare Engine below the condition,  airworthiness,
value or utility thereof  immediately  prior to such  alteration,  modification,
removal or addition assuming such Airframe,  such Engine, such Propeller or such
Spare Engine was then in the condition required to be maintained by the terms of
this Security Agreement. In addition, the value (but not the utility,  condition
or airworthiness) of any Airframe, any Engine, any Propeller or any Spare Engine
may be reduced by the value,  if any,  of  Obsolete  Parts which shall have been
removed so long as the  aggregate  value of all Obsolete  Parts which shall have
been removed and not replaced shall not exceed the Obsolete Parts Cap. All Parts
incorporated or installed in or attached or added to an Airframe,  an Engine,  a
Propeller or a Spare Engine as the result of such  alteration,  modification  or
addition  (except those parts which are excluded from the definition of Parts or
which  may be  removed  by the  Company  pursuant  to the  next  sentence)  (the
"Additional  Parts") shall,  without  further act, become subject to the Lien of
the Security Documents.  Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, the Company (or
any  Permitted  Lessee) may, at its own expense,  so long as no Event of Default
shall  have  occurred  and be  continuing,  remove or suffer to be  removed  any
Additional  Part,  provided that such Additional Part (i) is in addition to, and
not in replacement of or substitution  for, any Part originally  incorporated or
installed  in or attached to such  Airframe,  any Engine,  any  Propeller or any
Spare  Engine  at  the  time  of  delivery  thereof  hereunder  or any  Part  in
replacement  of or  substitution  for any such Part,  (ii) is not required to be
incorporated  or installed in or attached or added to any Airframe,  any Engine,
any  Propeller  or any  Spare  Engine  pursuant  to the first  sentence  of this
paragraph  (c) and (iii) can be removed from such  Airframe,  such Engine,  such
Propeller or such Spare Engine without diminishing the condition, airworthiness,
value or utility of the  Airframe,  such  Engine,  such  Propeller or such Spare
Engine which such  Airframe,  such Engine,  such  Propeller or such Spare Engine
would have had at such time had such  alteration,  modification  or addition not
occurred. Upon the removal thereof as provided above, such Additional Part shall
no longer be deemed to be subject to the Lien of the Security  Documents or part
of the Airframe, Engine, Propeller or Spare Engine from which it was removed.

     (d) Certain Matters Regarding Passenger Convenience Equipment.  The Company
may at any time and from time to time  install on any  Airframe,  subject to the
requirements of Section 2.02(c) above,  Passenger  Convenience Equipment that is
(i) owned by another Person and leased to the Company,  (ii) sold to the Company

                                       24
<PAGE>

by another  Person  subject to a  conditional  sale  contract or other  retained
security  interest,  (iii)  leased to the  Company  pursuant to a lease which is
subject to a security  interest in favor of another  Person or (iv) installed on
the applicable  Aircraft  subject to a license granted to the Company by another
Person, and in any such case (A) the Collateral Agent will not acquire or claim,
as against  any such other  Person,  any right,  title or  interest  in any such
Passenger  Convenience  Equipment solely as a result of its installation on such
Airframe,  (B) the  Company  shall  notify  such  Person of  Collateral  Agent's
interest in such  Aircraft,  and (C) the Company shall  procure  that,  upon the
occurrence  of  any  default  under  the  applicable  lease,   conditional  sale
agreement,  security agreement or license,  such Person shall not be entitled to
repossess such Passenger  Convenience  Equipment  unless it shall, in connection
with such  repossession,  undertake to restore such Aircraft to the condition it
had been in had the  installation  of such Passenger  Convenience  Equipment not
occurred.

     Section 2.03 Pledged Spare Parts Use, Possession and Designated  Locations.

     (a) The Company shall have the right,  at any time and from time to time at
its own cost and expense,  without any release from or consent by the Collateral
Agent,  to deal with the Pledged Spare Parts in any manner  consistent  with the
Company's  ordinary course of business,  including without limitation any of the
following:

     (i) to  incorporate  in,  install on or attach or make  appurtenant  to any
aircraft,  engine or Appliance leased to or owned by the Company (whether or not
subject  to any  Lien) or any  Pledged  Spare  Part,  free  from the Lien of the
Security Documents;

     (ii) to  dismantle  any  Pledged  Spare  Part that has  become  worn out or
obsolete or unfit for use, and to sell or dispose of any such Pledged Spare Part
or any  salvage  resulting  from  such  dismantling,  free  from the Lien of the
Security Documents; and

     (iii) to transfer any or all of the Pledged  Spare Parts  located at one or
more Designated Locations to one or more other Designated Locations.

     (b) Without the prior consent of the Collateral Agent, the Company will not
sell,  lease,  transfer or  relinquish  possession  of any Pledged Spare Part to
anyone other than the Company,  except as  permitted by the  provisions  of this
Section  2.03 and except that the Company  shall have the right in the  ordinary
course of business,  (i) to transfer possession of any Pledged Spare Part to the
Manufacturer  thereof or any service  provider for testing,  overhaul,  repairs,
maintenance,  alterations  or  modifications  purposes  or (ii) to  subject  any
Pledged  Spare  Part  to an  interchange  or  pooling,  exchange,  borrowing  or
maintenance  servicing arrangement customary in the airline industry and entered
into  in the  ordinary  course  of  business;  provided,  however,  that  if the
Company's  title to any such Pledged Spare Part shall be divested under any such
agreement or  arrangement,  such  divestiture  shall be deemed to be an Event of
Loss with  respect to such  Pledged  Spare Part  subject  to the  provisions  of
Section 3.01(c).

     (c) The Company  shall  maintain and keep the Pledged Spare Parts at one or
more of the  Designated  Locations,  except as  otherwise  permitted  under this
Section  2.03.  If any Pledged  Spare Part,  at any time and for any reason,  is
located at any other than a  Designated  Location  or if the  Company  wishes to

                                       25
<PAGE>

subject  additional  Qualified Spare Parts to the Lien of the Security Documents
and such Qualified Spare Parts are not located at any Designated  Location,  the
Company will promptly furnish to the Collateral Agent the following:

     (i) a Security Agreement  Supplement (Pledged Spare Parts) duly executed by
the Company,  identifying each location that is to become a Designated  Location
and specifically subjecting the Pledged Spare Parts at such location to the Lien
of the Security Documents;

     (ii) a legal  opinion  from  counsel  (which  opinion and counsel  shall be
reasonably satisfactory to the Collateral Agent), dated the date of execution of
said Security  Agreement  Supplement  (Pledged  Spare Parts),  stating that said
Security  Agreement  Supplement  (Pledged  Spare  Parts) has been duly filed for
recording in accordance  with the  provisions  of the Federal  Aviation Act, and
either:  (A) no other  filing or recording is required in any other place within
the United States in order to perfect the Lien of the Security  Documents on the
Qualified  Spare  Parts  held  at the  Designated  Locations  specified  in such
Security Agreement Supplement (Pledged Spare Parts) under the laws of the United
States,  or (B) if any such  filing or  recording  shall be  required  that said
filing has been  accomplished  in such other  manner and places,  which shall be
specified  in such legal  opinion,  as are  necessary to perfect the Lien of the
Security Documents; and

     (iii) an Officer's  Certificate  stating that in the opinion of the officer
executing the Officers'  Certificate,  all conditions  precedent provided for in
this Security  Agreement relating to the subjection of such property to the Lien
of the Security Documents have been complied with.

     The Company shall,  on an ongoing  basis,  effect any filings or recordings
(or amend any existing  filings or recordings)  which are necessary or desirable
to perfect the security  interest of the Collateral Agent in the Qualified Spare
Parts  which are being  subjected  to the Lien  hereof in  accordance  with this
Section 2.03 and shall promptly deliver copies of any such filings or recordings
to the Collateral Agent.

     Section 2.04 Insurance.

     (a) Public Liability and Property Damage Insurance.  (i) Except as provided
in clause (ii) of this Section  2.04(a),  and subject to  self-insurance  to the
extent  permitted by Section 2.04(e) hereof at all times, the Company will carry
or cause to be carried  with  respect to each  Aircraft and each Spare Engine at
its or any  Permitted  Lessee's  expense  (A)  comprehensive  airline  liability
(including,  without  limitation,  passenger,  contractual,  bodily injury,  and
property  damage  liability  and  product  liability)  insurance  (exclusive  of
Manufacturer's  product liability insurance),  (B) cargo liability insurance and
(C) war risk  liability  insurance in each case (I) in an amount per  occurrence
not less than the greater of (x) the amounts of comprehensive  airline liability
insurance  from time to time  applicable  per occurrence to aircraft and engines
owned or leased and  operated by the  Company of the same type as such  Aircraft
and such Spare Engines and (y) the Minimum Liability  Insurance Amount,  (II) of
the same type (subject,  however,  to Section 2.04(h)) and covering at least the

                                       26
<PAGE>

same risks as from time to time are  applicable to aircraft and engines owned or
leased and  operated by the Company of the same type as such  Aircraft  and such
Spare  Engines,  and (III)  which is  maintained  in effect  with  insurers  (or
reinsurers)  of  nationally  or   internationally   recognized   reputation  and
reasonably believed to be financially sound.

     (ii) During any period that an Airframe, Engine, Propeller or Spare Engine,
as the case may be, is on the ground and not in operation, the Company may carry
or  cause  to be  carried  as to  such  non-operating  property,  in lieu of the
insurance required by clause (i) above, and subject to the self-insurance to the
extent permitted by Section 2.04(e) hereof,  insurance by insurers of recognized
reputation and reasonably believed to be financially sound otherwise  conforming
with the  provisions of clause (i) except that (A) the amounts of coverage shall
not be  required  to exceed  the  amounts  of  comprehensive  airline  liability
insurance  from  time to time  applicable  to  property  owned or  leased by the
Company  of the same  type as such  non-operating  property  and which is on the
ground and not in operation; and (B) the scope of the risks covered and the type
of  insurance  shall be the same as from  time to time  shall be  applicable  to
property  owned or leased by the Company of the same type as such  non-operating
property and which is on the ground and not in operation.

     (iii)  The  Company  will  carry  or  cause  to be  carried  at  all  times
comprehensive  airline  liability  insurance,   including,  without  limitation,
property damage liability  insurance with respect to the Pledged Spare Parts and
Pledged  Equipment,  which is (A) of  amount  and  scope  as may be  customarily
maintained by similar  corporations  engaged in the same or similar business and
similarly  situated  as the Company for  property  similar to the Pledged  Spare
Parts and  Pledged  Equipment,  (B)  maintained  in  effect  with  insurers  (or
reinsurers)  of  nationally  or   internationally   recognized   reputation  and
reasonably  believed to be financially sound and (C) with such retentions as the
Company  customarily  maintains  (provided,  however,  that  any  self-insurance
retention or deductible shall not exceed $1,000,000 per occurrence).

     (b) Insurance Against Loss or Damage to an Aircraft, a Spare Engine, etc.

     (i) With respect to Aircraft  only,  subject to the  provisions  of Section
2.04(e) hereof permitting self-insurance, the Company shall maintain or cause to
be maintained in effect, at its or any Permitted Lessee's expense, with insurers
of recognized  reputation  and reasonably  believed to be financially  sound (A)
"all-risk"  aircraft hull  insurance  covering  each  Aircraft,  (B)  "all-risk"
coverage  of Spare  Engines,  Engines,  Propellers  and Parts  (while such Spare
Engines,  Engines,  Propellers  and  Parts  are  temporarily  removed  from such
Aircraft and not replaced by similar  components)  and (C)  "all-risk"  coverage
with  respect to Pledged  Spare Parts and Pledged  Equipment,  in such forms and
amounts and with such  retentions  as the  Company  customarily  maintains  with
respect to similar property owned or operated by the Company (provided, however,
that any self-insurance  retention or deductible shall not exceed $1,000,000 per
occurrence);  provided,  that  such  insurance  shall at all  times  while  such
Aircraft  and Spare  Engines are  subject to the  Security  Documents  be for an
amount (taking into account  self-insurance  to the extent  permitted by Section
2.04(e)  hereof) not less than the Insured  Amount for such  Aircraft  and Spare
Engines.  In the case of a loss with respect to an engine  (other than an Engine
or  Spare  Engine)  or  propeller  (other  than a  Propeller)  installed  on any
Airframe,  the  Collateral  Agent shall,  subject to Section  2.6(c) of the Loan

                                       27
<PAGE>

Agreement,  as  promptly  as  practicable  remit any  payment  made to it of any
insurance  proceeds  in respect of such loss to the  Company or any other  third
party  identified,  to the  Collateral  Agent  by the  Company  in an  Officer's
Certificate, entitled to receive such proceeds.

     (ii) All losses will be  adjusted by the Company  (giving due regard to the
interest of the Collateral  Agent) with the insurers;  provided,  however,  that
during a period  when any  Specified  Default  or Event of  Default  shall  have
occurred and be continuing,  the Company shall not agree to any such  adjustment
without  the prior  written  consent of the  Collateral  Agent.  As between  the
Collateral  Agent and the  Company,  it is agreed that all proceeds of insurance
maintained in compliance with the preceding paragraph and received as the result
of the occurrence of an Event of Loss will be applied in accordance with Section
3.01.

     (c) War-Risk, Hijacking and Related Perils Insurance.

     (i) The Company shall at all times maintain hull coverage, in an amount not
less than the Insured  Amount for each Aircraft and Spare Engine,  for war risk,
hijacking and related perils at least as broad as Lloyd's of London Form LSW555B
as in effect on the date hereof,  or its  substantive  equivalent  as reasonably
determined  by  the  Collateral  Agent  (such  determination  to be  made  after
consultation with the Company's insurance broker).

     (ii) At all times when  Section  2.04(a)(ii)  shall not apply,  the Company
shall  maintain  or cause to be  maintained  world-wide  liability  coverage  of
war-risk, hijacking and related perils insurance at least as broad as AVN 52D as
in  effect on the date  hereof,  or its  substantive  equivalent  as  reasonably
determined  by  the  Collateral  Agent  (such  determination  to be  made  after
consultation with the Company's  insurance broker) in an amount,  subject to the
provisions of Section  2.04(e),  not less than the Minimum  Liability  Insurance
Amount.

     (d) Reports,  Certificates,  etc. The Company will furnish,  or cause to be
furnished,  to the  Collateral  Agent on or before the  Closing  Date,  and each
annual  renewal  of  the  applicable  insurances,  (i) a  report,  signed  by an
authorized  representative  of Aon Risk Services,  Inc. or any other independent
firm of insurance  brokers  reasonably  acceptable to the Collateral Agent which
brokers may be  regularly  retained by the Company  (the  "Insurance  Brokers"),
describing in reasonable  detail the hull and liability  insurance (and property
insurance  for  detached  engines,  parts  and other  items)  then  carried  and
maintained  with respect to the  Collateral and stating the opinion of such firm
that (A) such  insurance  complies  with the terms  hereof,  (B) all premiums in
connection  with such  insurance  then due have been paid and (C) such insurance
together with any  self-insurance  permitted hereby provides  coverages  against
risks that are customarily insured against by Certificated Air Carriers and that
such coverages are in  substantially  similar forms,  are of such types and have
limits as are  customarily  carried by  Certificated  Air  Carriers;  and (ii) a
certificate of insurance  evidencing  the due compliance  with the terms of this
Section 2.04 relating to insurance with respect to the  Collateral.  The Company
will cause such  Insurance  Broker to agree to advise  the  Collateral  Agent in
writing of any  default in the payment of any premium and of any act or omission
on the part of the Company of which it has knowledge and which might  invalidate
or render  unenforceable,  in whole or in part,  any insurance on the applicable
Collateral  and to advise the  Collateral  Agent in writing at least thirty (30)
days (twenty (20) days in the case of lapse for nonpayment of premiums and seven
(7)  days in the  case of war  risk and  allied  perils  coverage)  prior to the

                                       28
<PAGE>

cancellation (but not expiration),  lapse for non-payment of premium or material
adverse  change of any  insurance  maintained  pursuant  to this  Section  2.04;
provided that if the notice period specified above is not reasonably obtainable,
the Company will cause the  Insurance  Broker to provide for as long a period of
prior notice as shall then be reasonably  obtainable.  In addition,  the Company
will also cause such Insurance  Broker to deliver to the Collateral  Agent on or
prior  to the  date  of  expiration  of any  insurance  policy  referenced  in a
previously delivered  certificate of insurance,  a new certificate of insurance,
substantially  in the same form as  delivered  by the Company to the  Collateral
Agent on the  Closing  Date  except for  changes  in the report or the  coverage
consistent  with the terms  hereof.  In the event that the Company shall fail to
maintain or cause to be maintained insurance as herein provided,  the Collateral
Agent  may,  at its sole  option,  but shall be under no duty to,  procure  such
insurance on behalf of the Company and, in such event,  the Company shall,  upon
demand,  reimburse the  Collateral  Agent for the cost thereof to the Collateral
Agent,  together with interest on such cost at the Overdue Rate from the date of
such payment by the Collateral Agent to the date of reimbursement without waiver
of any other rights the Collateral Agent may have;  provided,  however,  that no
exercise by the  Collateral  Agent of said option shall affect the provisions of
this Security  Agreement or the other Loan  Documents,  including the provisions
that  failure  by  the  Company  to  maintain  the  prescribed  insurance  shall
constitute  an Event of Default.  Upon  receipt of any  notices or reports,  the
Collateral Agent shall as promptly as practicable  forward copies of the same to
the Agent, the Loan  Administrator,  the Board,  each of the Lenders and each of
the  Participants.  The  Collateral  Agent  shall  have  no  responsibility  for
independently   verifying  the  accuracy  or  completeness  of  any  information
contained in any report or certificate provided by the Insurance Brokers.

     (e)  Self-Insurance.  The Company (but no Permitted Lessee) may self-insure
the risks required to be insured  against  pursuant to this Section 2.04 under a
program  applicable to all aircraft  (whether  owned or leased) in the Company's
fleet,  but in no case  shall the  aggregate  amount of such  self-insurance  in
regard to Sections 2.04(a) and 2.04(b) hereof exceed for any calendar year, with
respect to all of the aircraft  (whether owned or leased) in the Company's fleet
(including,  without limitation,  the Aircraft)  $2,500,000.  In addition to the
foregoing  right to  self-insure,  the Company  (and any  Permitted  Lessee) may
self-insure, to the extent of any applicable mandatory minimum per aircraft (or,
if  applicable,  per  annum or other  period)  the hull or  liability  insurance
deductible  imposed  by the  aircraft  hull  or  liability  insurer,  which  are
commensurate with the standard deductibles in the aircraft insurance industry.

     (f) Additional  Insurance by the Company.  The Company (and, if applicable,
any Permitted Lessee) may at its own expense carry insurance with respect to its
interest in the Aircraft, Engines,  Propellers,  Spare Engines and Pledged Spare
Parts in amounts in excess of that  required to be  maintained  by this  Section
2.04;  provided,  however,  that such insurance does not prevent the Company (or
such Permitted Lessee) from carrying the insurance required or permitted by this
Section  2.04 or  adversely  affect  such  insurance  or the cost  thereof;  and
provided,  further,  that the  proceeds  of such  insurance  shall be subject to
Section 2.6(c) of the Loan Agreement.

     (g) Indemnification by Government in Lieu of Insurance. Notwithstanding any
provisions of this Section 2.04 requiring insurance, the Collateral Agent agrees
to accept, in lieu of insurance against any risk with respect to the Aircraft or
Spare Engines, indemnification from, or insurance provided by, the United States

                                       29
<PAGE>

Government,  against such risk in an amount  which,  when added to the amount of
insurance  against such risk maintained by the Company (or any Permitted Lessee)
shall be at least equal to the amount of insurance  against such risk  otherwise
required by this Section 2.04 (taking into account  self-insurance  permitted by
Section 2.04(e) hereof).  Any such  indemnification or insurance provided by the
United States Government shall provide  substantially  similar protection as the
insurance  required  by this  Section  2.04.  The Company  shall  furnish to the
Collateral  Agent,  in advance of attachment of such indemnity or insurance,  an
Officer's  Certificate  stating that such  indemnification or insurance complies
with  the  preceding  sentence,  and  promptly  following  such  attachment,  an
Officer's  Certificate  confirming in reasonable  detail the amount and scope of
such indemnification or insurance and an FAA Certificate of Insurance confirming
that such  insurance  has been  obtained  from the United  States  Government in
compliance with this Section 2.4.

     (h) Terms of Insurance  Policies.  Any policies  carried in accordance with
Sections 2.04(a) through 2.04(c) hereof covering the applicable Collateral,  and
any policies taken out in substitution or replacement for any such policies, (i)
shall name the Additional  Insureds as additional  insureds and, for purposes of
Sections  2.04(b),  2.04(c)(i) and 2.04(i),  the  Collateral  Agent as sole loss
payee,  as their  respective  interests may appear (but without  imposing on any
such party liability to pay premiums with respect to such  insurance),  (ii) may

Event of Default.  Any amount  referred to in this Section 2.04 which is payable
to or retainable  by the Company (or any Permitted  Lessee) shall not be paid to
or  retained by the  Company  (or any  Permitted  Lessee) if at the time of such
payment or  retention  a  Specified  Default  or an Event of Default  shall have
occurred and be continuing,  but shall be held by or paid over to the Collateral
Agent  and  applied  against  the  obligations  of the  Company  under  the Loan
Documents.  At such time as there  shall not be  continuing  any such  Specified
Default or Event of  Default,  such  amount  shall be paid to the Company to the
extent not previously applied in accordance with the preceding  sentence.  Prior
to  remitting  any such funds to the  Company,  the  Collateral  Agent  shall be
authorized  to request and  receive an  Officer's  Certificate  from the Company
certifying  that no  Specified  Default or Event of Default has  occurred and is
continuing.

     Section 2.05  Inspection.  (a) At reasonable times not more often than once
in any twelve (12) month  period,  and upon at least ten (10) days prior written
notice to the Company (provided,  however,  that if a Specified Default or Event

at  reasonable  times without any limit on the number of times and upon at least
three (3)  Business  Days'  prior  written  notice to and at the  expense of the
Company),  the  Collateral  Agent or the  Board or their  respective  authorized

and inspect  and make  copies of the books and of the Company and any  Permitted
Lessee  required  to be  maintained  by the FAA or other  applicable  regulatory
agency or body (at the Company's risk and expense).  Any such  inspection of any
Aircraft,  any Spare  Engine or any  Pledged  Spare Part shall be subject to the
Company's (or any Permitted  Lessee's)  safety and security rules  applicable at
the location of such Collateral and, so long as no Specified Default of Event of
Default shall have occurred and be  continuing,  no exercise of such  inspection
right  shall  interfere  with  the  normal  operation  or  maintenance  of  such
Collateral  by, or the  normal  business  operations  of,  the  Company  (or any
Permitted  Lessee).  Neither the  Collateral  Agent nor the Board shall have any
duty to make any such  inspection  and shall incur no liability or obligation by
reason of not making any such inspection.

     (b) The  Collateral  Agent may by  written  notice to the  Company  request
notice of the next  scheduled  heavy  maintenance  visit of any Aircraft and the
Company  shall  permit  observation  of such  visit  subject  to the  terms  and
conditions set forth above.

the Collateral  Agent upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event
of Default to so notify the Account  Debtors  without  giving prior notice to or
making a demand  upon the Company  including,  without  limitation,  any notices
required  to be given  under the  Anti-Assignment  Act (41 U.S.C.  ss. 15 and 31
U.S.C.  ss. 3727)) and (ii) transfer to the Collateral Agent or its designee all
funds  received  by it from or on behalf of an Account  Debtor in respect of the
Pledged  Accounts (it being  acknowledged  and agreed that the Company  shall be

                                       31
<PAGE>

deemed to be holding all such funds as trustee for the Collateral  Agent and, as
such, shall not commingle such funds with other funds of the Company);

     (b) upon the  acquisition  after  the date  hereof  by the  Company  of any
additional or replacement Pledged Equipment covered by a certificate of title or
ownership,  cause the  Collateral  Agent to be listed as the  lienholder on such

of which list the Company shall deliver to the  Collateral  Agent promptly after
the  end of each  fiscal  quarter  of the  Company  and as  soon as  practicable
following the Collateral Agent's request,  and (ii) stamp or otherwise mark such
books and records in such  manner as may be  required  to perfect  the  security
interest in such  Collateral or at the request of the Collateral  Agent in order
to reflect the security interests granted by this Security Agreement;

the  Company's  place of business to receive  copies of all  communications  and
remittances relating to the UCC Collateral, and forward copies of any notices or
communications  received by the Company with respect to the UCC Collateral,  all
in such manner as may be deemed necessary or advisable;

     (e) if it wishes to subject any  additional  Accounts,  Equipment  or other
Goods to the Lien of the Security Documents, at its sole cost and expense, amend
or supplement this Agreement to include such Accounts,  Equipment or other Goods
(which  amendment  or  supplement   shall   constitute  a  "Security   Agreement
Supplement" under the Loan Agreement),  and the Collateral Agent shall take, and
the Company  shall  authorize the  Collateral  Agent to take (to the extent such
authorization is necessary or required),  at the Company's sole cost and expense
such action (including,  without limitation, filing UCC financing statements and
the provision of requisite notices of assignment  pursuant to applicable law and

Goods and the Company shall  otherwise  comply with the terms of Section 5.14 of
the Loan Agreement with respect to such additional collateral;

     (f) use commercially  reasonable  efforts to cause to be collected from its
Account  Debtors,  as and when due all amounts owing under or on account of each

are delinquent,  which shall be collected in accordance  with lawful  collection
procedures)  and shall apply  forthwith upon receipt thereof all such amounts as
are so collected to the outstanding balance of such Pledged Accounts;

     (g) keep the UCC  Collateral  (as  applicable)  in good  working  order and
repair,  ordinary  wear  and  tear  excepted,  and not use  such  Collateral  in
violation of law or any policy of insurance thereon;

     (h) not change (i) its name, identity or corporate structure in any manner,
(ii) the location of its chief  executive  office or (iii) its  jurisdiction  of
organization  in any manner unless it shall have given the  Collateral  Agent at
least thirty (30) days' prior  written  notice  thereof;  and

     (i) not  change  the  location  of any UCC  Collateral  owned by it if such
change  would  cause the  security  interests  of the  Collateral  Agent in such
Collateral to lapse or cease to be perfected.

     Section 2.07 Liens.  The Company will not  directly or  indirectly  create,
incur,  assume or suffer to exist any Lien on or with respect to any Collateral,

occurrence) give the Collateral Agent written notice of such Event of Loss; and

     (B) not later than the earlier of (x) 60 days after the  occurrence of such
Event of Loss or (y) the fifth (5th) Business Day following  notification to the
Company of receipt by the loss payee of the  insurance  proceeds with respect to
such Event of Loss, give the Collateral  Agent written notice of its election to
perform one of the following  options (it being  understood  that the failure to

                                       33
<PAGE>

give such  notice  shall be deemed to be an  election of the option set forth in
subclause (1) below):

     (1) Not later than the earlier of (x) the Business Day next  succeeding the
one hundred eightieth (180th) day following the occurrence of such Event of Loss

insurance provider,  the Collateral Agent shall apply such insurance proceeds on
behalf of the Company as a prepayment in accordance  with Section  2.6(c) of the
Loan Agreement. If such insurance proceeds are less than the Insured Amount, the
Company  shall pay or cause to be paid to the  Collateral  Agent the  difference
between the Insured Amount and the amount of such proceeds; or

     (2) Not  later  than the  Business  Day  next  succeeding  the one  hundred
eightieth  (180th)  day  following  the  occurrence  of such Event of Loss,  the
Company shall substitute an aircraft  (together with engines and, if applicable,
propellers installed thereon) in accordance with the terms hereof subject to the
provisions  of  Section  2.6(c) of the Loan  Agreement,  provided  that if (x) a
Specified  Default or Event of Default  shall have occurred and be continuing as
of  such  election  date  or (y)  the  Company  shall  have  elected  to  make a
substitution  under  this  clause (2) and shall fail for any reason to make such
substitution  in accordance  with the terms hereof,  then the Company shall make
the payments required by clause (1) above on such date.

provisions of clause (1) above, the Collateral Agent shall release from the Lien
of the Security  Documents  such  Aircraft by executing  and  delivering  to the
Company all documents and  instruments,  prepared at the Company's sole cost and
expense, as the Company may reasonably request to evidence such release.

     (iii)  The  Company's  right  to  substitute  any   Replacement   Airframe,

satisfactory to the Collateral Agent), addressed to the Collateral Agent, to the
effect  that each  Replacement  Airframe,  Replacement  Engine  and  Replacement

change in law, the protections  afforded to the Collateral Agent by Section 1110

                                       35

counsel in any jurisdiction  outside the United States where the Aircraft may be
registered in accordance with Section  2.01(a)(iii))  (which opinion and counsel

States  Government  or  other  government  of  registry  of an  Aircraft  or any
instrumentality or agency of any thereof not constituting an Event of Loss, will
be applied as follows:

     (i) if payments  are  received  with respect to an Airframe (or an Airframe

     (iii) if such  payments are received with respect to any Pledged Spare Part
under circumstances  contemplated by Section 3.01(c) hereof, such payments shall

of any Airframe and the Engines or engines or Propellers or propellers installed

registry of such Aircraft or any  instrumentality or agency of any thereof,  the
Company shall promptly notify the Collateral Agent of such requisition,  and all
of the Company's  obligations under this Security Agreement with respect to such
Aircraft  shall  continue  to the same  extent  as if such  requisition  had not
occurred. Subject to the rights of the Collateral Agent, upon the occurrence and
during the continuance of a Specified Default or Event of Default,  all payments
received by the Collateral Agent or the Company from such government for the use
of such Airframe and Engines or engines or  Propellers  or  propellers  shall be

Engine  hereunder and Collateral  Agent and the Company (or Permitted  Lessee as
the case may be) shall  comply with the terms of Section  3.01(b)  hereof to the
same extent as if an Event of Loss had occurred at the time of such  requisition
with  respect  to such  Engine,  such  Propeller  or  such  Spare  Engine.  Upon

Section 3.01(b) hereof, any payments received by Collateral Agent or the Company
from such government with respect to such requisition  shall be paid over to, or
retained by the Company.

     (g)  Application  of Payments  During  Existence of Specified  Defaults and

payment or  retention  a  Specified  Default or any Event of Default  shall have

                                       39
<PAGE>

occurred  and be  continuing,  but shall be held by or paid  over to  Collateral
Agent and applied  against  the  obligations  of the Company (or such  Permitted
Lessee) under the Loan Documents.  At such time as there shall not be continuing

Company to the extent not  previously  applied in accordance  with the preceding
sentence. Prior to remitting any such funds to the Company, the Collateral Agent
shall be  authorized  to request and receive an Officer's  Certificate  from the
Company  certifying  that no Specified  Default or Event of Default has occurred
and is continuing.

     (h)  Treatment of Insurance  Proceeds in  Accordance  with Loan  Agreement.

Company  elects  pursuant  to this  Section  3.01  to  substitute  an  aircraft,
Replacement  Airframe,  Replacement Engine,  Replacement  Propeller,  Acceptable

     (a) For the purpose of enforcing any and all rights and remedies under this
Security Agreement, after an Event of Default shall have occurred and so long as
such Event of Default shall be  continuing:  (i) upon the written  demand of the
Collateral  Agent and at the  Company's  expense,  the  Company  shall  promptly
deliver  possession of any Collateral as the  Collateral  Agent may so demand to
the  Collateral  Agent or its designee in the manner and condition  required by,
and otherwise in accordance with all the provisions of, this Security Agreement,
or the  Collateral  Agent at its option may enter upon the premises where all or
any part of the  Collateral  is located  and take  immediate  possession  of and
remove the same by  summary  proceedings  or  otherwise  (and at the  Collateral
Agent's option,  store the same at the Company's premises until disposal thereof
by the Collateral Agent), all without liability accruing to the Collateral Agent
(other than that caused by the Collateral  Agent's  willful  misconduct or gross
negligence  as  actually  and  finally  determined  by a  final,  non-appealable
judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction) for or by reason of such entry or
taking of  possession  or  removing  whether  for the  restoration  of damage to
property caused by such action or otherwise;  and (ii) the Company shall, at the
request of the Collateral Agent,  promptly execute and deliver to the Collateral
Agent such  instruments  or other  documents as may be necessary or advisable to
enable the  Collateral  Agent or an agent or  representative  designated  by the
Collateral  Agent,  at such time or times and place or places as the  Collateral
Agent may specify, to obtain possession of all or any part of the Collateral the
possession  of which  the  Collateral  Agent  shall at the time be  entitled  to
hereunder;  provided, that during any period any Aircraft is activated under the
Civil  Reserve Air Fleet Program in  accordance  with the  provisions of Section
2.01(b)(i)(F)  hereof  and in the  possession  of the  government  of the United
States of America or an instrumentality or agency thereof,  the Collateral Agent
shall not,  on account of any Event of Default,  be entitled to exercise  any of
its rights under this Section 4.01 against the  Collateral  in such manner as to

                                       40
<PAGE>

limit the Company's control of the associated  Airframe or any Engines installed
thereon,  unless at least sixty (60) days' (or such lesser period as may then be
applicable  under  the  Air  Mobility  Command  program  of  the  United  States
Government)  prior written notice of Default  hereunder shall have been given by
the  Collateral  Agent to the Company with a copy  addressed to the  Contracting
Office  Representative  for the Air  Mobility  Command of the United  States Air
Force under the contract with the Company relating to such Aircraft.

     (b) After an Event of Default shall have occurred and so long as such Event
of  Default  shall be  continuing,  then and in every  such case the  Collateral
Agent, as holder of a security interest in the Collateral may, and when required
pursuant to the provisions of Section 7.2 of the Loan Agreement shall, exercise,
any or all of the rights  and  powers  and  pursue  any and all of the  remedies
accorded to a secured  party under the UCC and under any other  applicable  law,
may recover  judgment in its own name as Collateral Agent against the Collateral
and may take possession of all or any part of the Collateral and may exclude the
Company and all Persons  claiming under any of them wholly or partly  therefrom.
Any proceeds  received or realized by the Collateral  Agent at any time pursuant
to the  exercise of remedies  hereunder  shall be  promptly  transferred  by the
Collateral  Agent to the account of the Agent specified in Section 2.9(a) of the
Loan Agreement for  application in accordance  with the priority of payments set
forth in Section 2.9(e) of the Loan Agreement.

     (c) So long as an Event of Default shall have  occurred and be  continuing,
the  Collateral  Agent may,  if at the time such action may be lawful and always
subject to compliance  with any  mandatory  legal  requirements,  either with or
without  taking  possession,  and either before or after taking  possession  and
without  instituting any legal  proceedings  whatsoever,  and having first given
notice of such sale by registered mail to the Company, at least 20 days prior to
the date of such sale,  and any other notice which may be required by law,  sell
and dispose of the  Collateral,  or any part thereof,  or interest  therein,  at
public  auction or private sale, in one lot as an entirety or in separate  lots,
and either for cash or on credit and on such terms as the  Collateral  Agent may
determine, and at any place (whether or not it be the location of the Collateral
or any part thereof) and time designated in the notice above referred to.

     (d) Any such sale may be adjourned from time to time by announcement at the
time and place appointed for such sale, or for any such adjourned sale,  without
further  notice,  and the Collateral  Agent or any Lender may bid and become the
purchaser  at any such sale and each  Lender  shall be  entitled  at any  public
auction  sale to credit  against any purchase  price bid at such public  auction
sale by such  Lender  all or any part of any  unpaid  obligations  owing to such
Lender secured by the Lien of the Security Documents.

     (e) If an Event of Default has occurred and is  continuing,  the Collateral
Agent  shall  also be  entitled  to  pursue  all or any  part of the  Collateral
wherever it may be found and may enter any of the premises of the Company or any
other Person  wherever the Collateral may be or be supposed to be and search for
the  Collateral and take  possession of any item of the  Collateral  pursuant to
this  Section  4.01(e).  The  Collateral  Agent may,  from time to time,  at the
expense  of  the  Company,  make  all  such  expenditures  for  the  collection,
maintenance,  insurance,  repairs,  replacements,   alterations,  additions  and
improvements to and of the Collateral, as it may deem proper. In each such case,
the Collateral  Agent shall have the right to collect,  maintain,  use,  insure,
operate,  store,  lease,  control  or  manage  the  Collateral,  and to carry on
business  and  exercise  all rights and powers of the  Company  relating  to the
Collateral as the Collateral Agent shall deem  appropriate,  including the right

                                       41
<PAGE>

to enter  into any and all  such  agreements  with  respect  to the  collection,
maintenance, use, insurance,  operation, storage, leasing, control or management
of the Collateral or any part thereof. The Collateral Agent shall be entitled to
collect,  sue for and receive  directly all monies due or to become due,  tolls,
rents,  issues,  profits,  products,  revenues or other income  pursuant to this
Section  4.01(e).  In accordance  with the terms of this Section  4.01(e),  such
monies due or to become due, tolls, rents, issues, profits,  products,  revenues
and other  income  shall be applied to pay the  expenses of  collecting,  using,
operating,  storing, leasing, controlling or managing the Collateral, and of all
maintenance,  insurance,  repairs,  replacements,   alterations,  additions  and
improvements,  and to make  all  payments  which  the  Collateral  Agent  may be
required or may elect to make,  if any,  for taxes,  assessments,  insurance  or
other proper  charges upon the  Collateral  or any part thereof  (including  the
employment of engineers  and  accountants  to examine,  inspect and make reports
upon the  properties  and  books  and  records  of the  Company),  and all other
payments which the Collateral  Agent may be required or authorized to make under
any provision of this Security  Agreement,  including this Section  4.01(e),  as
well as just and  reasonable  compensation  for the  services of the  Collateral
Agent, and of all persons properly engaged and employed by the Collateral Agent.

     (f) Subject to Section 4.01(c), the Collateral Agent may proceed to protect
and enforce this Security  Agreement by suit or suits or  proceedings in equity,
at law or in  bankruptcy,  and  whether  for  the  specific  performance  of any
covenant or  agreement  herein  contained  or in  execution  or aid of any power
herein  granted;  or for  foreclosure  hereunder,  or for the  appointment  of a
receiver  or  receivers  for the  Collateral  or any  part  thereof,  or for the
recovery of judgment for the indebtedness secured by the Lien created under this
Security  Agreement  or for  the  enforcement  of any  other  proper,  legal  or
equitable remedy available under applicable law.

     (g) Each and every right,  power and remedy herein given to the  Collateral
Agent  specifically or otherwise in this Security  Agreement shall be cumulative
and  shall  be in  addition  to every  other  right,  power  and  remedy  herein
specifically given or now or hereafter existing at law, in equity or by statute,
and each and every right, power and remedy whether  specifically herein given or
otherwise existing may be exercised from time to time and as often in such order
as may be deemed  expedient  by the  Collateral  Agent,  and the exercise or the
beginning  of the exercise of any power or remedy shall not be construed to be a
waiver of the right to exercise at the same time or thereafter  any other right,
power or remedy. No delay or omission by the Collateral Agent in the exercise of
any  right,  remedy or power or in  pursuing  any remedy  shall  impair any such
right, power or remedy or be construed to be a waiver of any default on the part
of the Company or to be an acquiescence therein.

     (h) Upon and during the  continuance  of an Event of Default the Collateral
Agent shall be  entitled  to  undertake  an  acceptance  of all or a part of the
Collateral  in  satisfaction  of  all or a  specified  part  of the  Obligations
pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of Sections 9-620 and 9-621 of
the UCC and, if pursuant  to such  Sections  and after such Event of Default the
Company  consents to such  acceptance,  which consent shall not be  unreasonably
withheld,  then the Company shall execute and deliver such deeds of  conveyance,
assignments  and other  documents  or  instruments  (including  any  notices  or
applications to the FAA or any other Governmental  Authority having jurisdiction
over the Collateral subject to such conveyance) as shall be reasonably  required
to effectuate the transfer of such Collateral,  together with the  certificates,

                                       42

thereto,  to the Collateral  Agent or any designee or designees  selected by the
Collateral Agent.

     Section 4.02  Expenses.  The Company agrees that it will upon demand pay to
the Collateral Agent:

     (a) the  amount of any taxes  payable by reason of the  Collateral  Agent's
security interests in respect of the Collateral or to free any of the Collateral
from any Lien thereon; and

     (b) the amount of any and all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, including,
but not limited to, any excise, property,  transfer, sales and use taxes imposed
by any state,  federal or other local  authority on any of the  Collateral,  and
reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel and of any other experts payable in
connection with the enforcement of this Security  Agreement after and during the
continuance of any Event of Default,  including such expenses as are incurred in
connection with:

     (i) the collection, sale or other disposition of the Collateral;

     (ii) any  action  taken by the  Collateral  Agent to effect  compliance  on
behalf of the  Company in respect of a failure by the Company to comply with the
provisions of this Security  Agreement which results (or is likely to result) in
the diminution of the value of the Collateral or the validity,  perfection, rank
or value of the Collateral Agent's security interest in the Collateral;

     (iii) protecting,  storing,  warehousing,  appraising,  insuring, handling,
maintaining, shipping, overhauling and repairing the Collateral; or

     (iv) the  exercise by the  Collateral  Agent of any of the rights or powers
conferred upon it hereunder.

     Any such  amount  not paid to the  Collateral  Agent on demand  shall  bear
interest  for each day until paid at a rate per annum equal to the sum of 2% per
annum plus the Applicable Tranche A Interest Rate for such day.

Security  Agreement,  the Company hereby waives, to the maximum extent permitted
by applicable law, notice and judicial hearing in connection with the Collateral
Agent's taking  possession,  retention,  disposition or sale of any  Collateral,
including  any and all prior  notice and hearing for any  prejudgment  remedy or
remedies  and any such right which the Company  would  otherwise  have under any
applicable  law, and the Company  hereby further  waives,  to the maximum extent
permitted by law:

     (i) provided that the actions taken comply, in all material respects,  with
applicable  law,  including but not limited to all applicable  provisions of the
UCC, all claims,  damages and demands against the Collateral  Agent,  the Board,
the Lenders  and the  Participants  arising  out of such  taking of  possession,

demands  as may  arise out of such  Person's  own gross  negligence  or  willful
misconduct as actually and finally determined by a final non-appealable judgment
of a court of  competent  jurisdiction  and only to the  extent  of  direct  (as
opposed to special, indirect, consequential or punitive) damages;

     (ii) all  other  requirements  as to the  time,  place and terms of sale or
other  requirements  with respect to the  enforcement of the Collateral  Agent's
rights hereunder; and

     (iii) all rights of redemption,  appraisal,  valuation,  stay, extension or
moratorium  now or  hereafter  in force  under  any  applicable  law in order to
prevent or delay the enforcement of this Security Agreement or the absolute sale
or other disposition of any part of the Collateral,  and the Company, for itself
and all who may claim under it, insofar as it or they now or hereafter  lawfully
may,  hereby waives the benefit of all such laws;  provided,  however,  that the
actions  taken by the  Collateral  Agent as  described  in Section  4.03  herein
comply, in all material respects, with applicable law, including but not limited
to all applicable provisions of the UCC.

     (b) The Company, for itself and all who claim through it, hereby waives all
right to have the Collateral  marshaled upon any  foreclosure  hereof and agrees
that any court having  jurisdiction  to foreclose  this  Security  Agreement may
order the sale of the Collateral as an entity.

     Section 4.04  Discontinuance  of Proceedings.  In case the Collateral Agent
shall have instituted any proceeding to enforce any right, power or remedy under
this Security  Agreement by  foreclosure,  sale,  entry or  otherwise,  and such
proceeding  shall have been  discontinued  or abandoned  for any reason or shall
have been determined  adversely to the Collateral  Agent, then and in every such
case the  Company,  the  Collateral  Agent and each Lender  shall be restored to
their former  positions  and rights  hereunder  with  respect to the  Collateral
subject to the security  interest and Lien created under the Security  Documents
and all rights, remedies and powers of the Collateral Agent shall continue as if
no such proceeding had been instituted.
