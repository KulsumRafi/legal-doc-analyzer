EMPLOYEES' STOCK PURCHASE PLAN<br>

<p>Effective as of April 16, 2002, the Corporation hereby
amends, restates and continues in its entirety, the Applied Materials,
Inc. Employees' Stock Purchase Plan on the following terms and
conditions.  The Plan is intended to encourage ownership of Common
Stock of the Corporation by all Eligible Employees and to provide
incentives for them to exert maximum efforts for the success of the
Corporation and its Affiliates.  By extending to Eligible Employees the
opportunity to acquire proprietary interests in the Corporation and to
participate in its success, the Plan may be expected to benefit the
Corporation and its shareholders by making it possible for the
Corporation to attract and retain qualified employees.  The Plan is
intended to qualify as an employee stock purchase plan under section

<p>4.1     The Plan shall be administered by the Board, except
to the extent that the Board shall delegate responsibility for the
administration of the Plan as stated in Section 4.3.

<p>4.2     The Board shall have the plenary power, subject to
and within the limits of the express provisions of the Plan:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>(a)     To construe and interpret the Plan and Options
granted under it, and to establish, amend and revoke rules and
regulations for its administration.  The Board, in the exercise of this
power, shall generally determine all questions of policy and expediency
that may arise, and may correct any defect, supply any omission or
reconcile any inconsistency in the Plan or in any instrument associated
with the Plan, in such manner and to such extent as the Board shall
deem necessary to make the Plan fully effective.

<p>(b)     To establish the terms of each Offering of
Common Stock under the Plan.

<p>(c)     Adopt such procedures and subplans as are
necessary or appropriate to permit participation in the Plan by

United States.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>4.3     The Board, by resolution, may delegate responsibility
for the administration of the Plan or any part thereof, to a committee

to act, all references in this Plan to the Board shall include the
Committee, subject, however, to such resolutions, not inconsistent with
the provisions of the Plan, as, from time to time, may be adopted by
the Board.  The Board at any time, by resolution, may revoke such
delegation and re-vest in the Board all or any part of the
responsibility for the administration of the Plan.

<p>4.4     The Board or the Committee (if authorized by the
Board under Section 4.3) may delegate to the Plan Administrator the
responsibility to perform certain ministerial duties in the
administration of the Plan as are specified in this Plan.  To the
extent that the Board or Committee has not delegated such duties to the
Plan Administrator, all references in this Plan to Plan Administrator
shall include the Board or Committee as appropriate.

<p><strong>5.      ELIGIBILITY</strong></p>

<p>Subject to the provisions of Section 7.14, an individual
shall be eligible to participate in any Offering under the Plan if he
or she (a) has been continuously employed by the Corporation and/or an
Affiliate for such minimum period (not to exceed two years) prior to
such Grant Date as the Board shall fix and (b) is customarily employed
by the Corporation and/or an Affiliate at least 20 hours per week and
five months per calendar year.  A member of the Board who is not also
an employee of the Corporation and/or an Affiliate shall not be
eligible to participate in the Plan.

<p><strong>6.      OFFERINGS</strong></p>

<p>During the term of the Plan, the Corporation will make one
or more offerings ("Offering") in which Options to purchase Common
Stock will be granted to Eligible Employees under the Plan.  The terms
and conditions of Options to be granted in any such Offering will be
determined by the Board under Section 7.  In connection with any
Offering, if the number of shares for which Eligible Employees elect to
participate shall be greater than the shares remaining available, the
available shares shall, at the end of the Offering Period, be allocated
among the Participating Employees pro rata on the basis of the number
of shares for which each has elected to participate.

<p><strong>7.      TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF OPTIONS</strong></p>


<p>7.1     Subject to the limitations herein contained, the
Board shall determine the terms of Options in each Offering all of
which shall be granted on the same date (the "Grant Date").

<p>7.2     The Option price per share for each Offering shall be
determined by the Board, but shall in no instance be less than the
lower of 85% of the fair market value of a share of the Common Stock on
the Grant Date, or 85% of the fair market value of a share of the
Common Stock on the date the Option is exercised (the "Exercise Date").
The fair market value of a share of the Common Stock on the Grant Date
or the Exercise Date shall be the last trade price of the Common Stock
as reported in the NASDAQ over-the-counter market for National Market
Issues by The Wall Street Journal on such Grant Date or Exercise Date,
as determined by the Board, or if no report is available for such date,
on the next subsequent date for which such a report is available.

<p>7.3     The expiration date of the Options granted under each
Offering shall be determined by the Board on or prior to the Grant Date
for such Offering, but in no event shall such expiration be more than
27 months from the Grant Date for such Offering.

<p>7.4     All Eligible Employees to whom Options are granted
shall have the same rights and privileges within the meaning of
Section 423 of the Code, and applicable rules and regulations
thereunder.

<p>7.5     Each Eligible Employee who desires to participate in
an Offering shall elect to do so in such manner as may be prescribed
from time to time by the Board.

<p>7.6     A Participating Employee shall exercise his or her
Option by delivering notice of exercise to the Plan Administrator or a
person designated by the Plan Administrator at such time and in such
manner as the Board shall prescribe.

<p>7.7     Upon exercise of an Option, full payment for the
shares subject to the Option shall be made in such form or manner as
the Board shall fix.

<p>7.8     The Board may (but is not required to) establish on
such terms and conditions as it shall determine (subject, however, to
the requirements of Section 423 of the Code) a payroll deduction system
for the purchase of shares covered by the Options hereunder.  If there
are payroll deductions under any Offering, the Corporation or an
Affiliate shall maintain a payroll deduction account for each
Participating Employee.  The Board may (but is not required to) provide
for interest at such rate as the Board shall determine to be credited
to the payroll deduction accounts.

<p>7.9     Subject to such requirements or limitations of
Section 423 of the Code as shall apply, the Board shall establish
rules, terms and conditions for each Offering governing the exercise of
outstanding Options in the event of a Participating Employee's
termination of employment or change in employment status.

<p>7.10    The Corporation will seek to obtain from each
regulatory committee or agency having jurisdiction such authority as
may be required to issue and sell shares of Common Stock to satisfy
Options granted under the Plan.  Inability of the Corporation to obtain
from any such regulatory commission or agency authority which counsel
for the Corporation deems necessary for the lawful issuance and sale of
its Common Stock to satisfy Options granted under the Plan, shall
relieve the Corporation from any liability for failure to issue and
sell Common Stock to satisfy such Options pending the time when such
authority is obtained or is obtainable.

<p>7.11    Neither an Eligible Employee to whom an Option is
granted under the Plan nor his or her transferee shall have any rights
as a stockholder with respect to any shares covered by his or her
Option until the date of the issuance of a stock certificate to him or
her for such shares.

<p>7.12    Options granted under the Plan shall not be
transferable, except by will or by the laws of descent and
distribution, and may be exercised during the lifetime of a
Participating Employee only by him or her.

<p>7.13    Each Option granted under the Plan shall be evidenced
by such instrument or documentation, if any, as the Board shall
establish, which shall be dated the Grant Date and shall comply with
and be subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan.

<p>7.14    No Eligible Employee shall be granted an Option under
the Plan if such Eligible Employee, immediately after the Option is
granted, would own stock possessing 5% or more of the total combined
voting power or value of all classes of stock of the Corporation,
determined in accordance with Section 423(b)(3) of the Code.  No
Eligible Employee shall be granted an Option under the Plan which
permits his or her right to purchase Common Stock under all employee
stock purchase plans of the Corporation (qualifying under Section 423
of the Code) to accrue at a rate which exceeds $25,000 (or such other
maximum as may be prescribed from time to time by the Code) of fair
market value of the Common Stock (determined at the time the Option is
granted) for each calendar year in which the Option is outstanding at
any time, in accordance with the provisions of Section 423(b)(8) of the
Code.

<p>7.15    Nothing in the Plan or in any Option granted under
the Plan shall confer on any Participating Employee any right to
continue in the employ of the Corporation or any of its Affiliates or
to interfere in any way with the right of the Corporation or any of its
Affiliates to terminate his or her employment at any time.

<p><strong>8.      FUNDS</strong></p>

<p>All amounts held by the Corporation or an Affiliate in
payroll deduction accounts under the Plan may be used for any corporate
purpose of the Corporation or Affiliate.

<p><strong>9.      ADJUSTMENT IN NUMBER OF SHARES AND IN OPTION PRICE</strong></p>

<p>In the event there is any change in the Common Stock
through declarations of stock dividends or stock split-ups,
recapitalizations resulting in stock split-ups, or combinations or
exchanges of shares, or otherwise, appropriate adjustments in the
number of shares available for Option, as well as the shares subject to
any Option and the Option price thereof, shall be made, provided that
no fractional shares shall be subject to an Option and each Option
shall be adjusted down to the nearest full share.

<p><strong>10.     AMENDMENT OF THE PLAN</strong></p>

<p>The Board at any time, and from time to time, may amend the
Plan, provided however, that except as provided in Section 9, approval
by the Shareholders of the Company shall be required (i) to increase
the aggregate number of shares which may be issued under the Plan and
(ii) to the extent necessary to preserve the qualification of the Plan
under Rule 16b-3.

<p><strong>11.     TERMINATION OR SUSPENSION OF THE PLAN</strong></p>

<p>The Board may at any time suspend or terminate the Plan.
No Offering shall be made under the Plan while it is suspended or after
it is terminated.
