      The parties hereto covenant and agree to take the following actions:

necessary information and reasonable assistance as any other party may request
in connection with its preparation of necessary filings or submissions pursuant

Department of Justice requests additional information from the parties or
imposes any condition upon the transactions contemplated hereby, the parties
will cooperate with each other, the Federal Trade Commission and the Department
of Justice; provided, however, that nothing herein shall compel either party or
any Affiliate of such party to comply with any condition imposed upon such party
or such Affiliate that is adverse to the interests of such party or its
Affiliates as determined by such party in the exercise of its reasonable
business judgment. Buyer shall pay all filing fees, if any, required under the
HSR Act.

            (d) Each party shall furnish to the other party all information
concerning such party and its Affiliates reasonably required for inclusion in

to or affecting any of the Licenses or their use. Seller will perform all of its
material obligations required to be performed under all of the Licenses. On the
Closing Date, Seller will be the exclusive, authorized, legal holder of the
Licenses.

become, subject or by which Seller is, or shall become, bound or any of Seller's
assets are, or shall become, bound (in each case, including, without limitation,
those as of the date hereof), or (B) any Court Order to which Seller is, or
shall become, a party or any of the Licenses are, or shall become, subject or by

                                   ARTICLE 9

                                 INDEMNIFICATION

      9.1 Survival. All of the representations, warranties and covenants of the
parties contained herein shall survive the Closing and shall continue in full
force and effect until the second anniversary of the Closing Date, except that
the representations and warranties set forth in Sections 4.2, 4.5 and 5.2 shall
survive the Closing until the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations, and the covenants to be performed in whole or in part after the
Closing shall survive the Closing until performed in full. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if any claim for indemnification pursuant to this Article 9 with
respect to a breach of the representations, warranties or covenants contained
herein is made on or before the end of any such applicable period, such
representations, warranties or covenants shall be deemed to survive with respect
to the matter claimed as of the end of such period until resolved as provided
herein.

      9.2 Indemnification by Seller. After the Closing, Seller agrees to
indemnify and hold Buyer and its Affiliates and their respective officers,
directors, Representatives, shareholders, members, partners, agents and
employees harmless against and with respect to, and shall reimburse Buyer and
its Affiliates and such other Persons for (a) any and all Losses and Expenses
resulting from any untrue representation or breach of warranty by Seller or the
nonfulfillment of any covenant to be performed by Seller contained in this
Agreement or in any Ancillary Document, and (b) any Pre-Closing Claim.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Seller will not be
required to indemnify, and will not otherwise be liable to, Buyer with respect
to any Losses or Expenses arising under this Section 9.2 with respect to any
breach of the representations and warranties of Seller set forth herein unless
Buyer gives Seller written notice of such claim pursuant to Section 9.4 on or
prior to the expiration of the period for bringing such claim set forth in
Section 9.1 hereof.

      9.3 Indemnification by Buyer. After the Closing, Buyer agrees to indemnify
and hold Seller and its Affiliates and their respective officers, directors,
Representatives, shareholders, members, partners, agents and employees harmless
against and with respect to, and shall reimburse Seller and its Affiliates and
such other Persons for (a) any and all Losses and Expenses resulting from any
untrue representation, breach of warranty by Buyer, or nonfulfillment of any
covenant to be performed by Buyer contained in this Agreement or any Ancillary
Document, and (b) any Post-Closing Claim. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, Buyer will not be required to indemnify, and will not
otherwise be liable to


                                     - 16 -
<PAGE>

Seller with respect to any Losses or Expenses arising under this Section 9.3
with respect to any breach of the representations and warranties of Buyer set
forth herein unless Seller gives Buyer written notice of such claim pursuant to
Section 9.4 on or prior to the expiration of the period for bringing such claim
set forth in Section 9.1 hereof.

      9.4 Procedure for Indemnification.

            (a) The party claiming indemnification (the "CLAIMANT") shall
promptly give notice to the party from which indemnification is claimed (the
"INDEMNIFYING PARTY") of any claim, whether between the parties or brought by a
third party, specifying in reasonable detail the factual basis for the claim and
the amount thereof (if known and quantifiable).

            (b) With respect to claims solely between the parties, following
receipt of notice from the Claimant of a claim, the Indemnifying Party shall
have thirty (30) days to make such investigation of the claim as the
Indemnifying Party deems necessary or desirable. For the purposes of such
investigation, the Claimant agrees to make available to the Indemnifying Party
and its authorized Representatives the information relied upon by the Claimant
to substantiate the claim. If the Claimant and the Indemnifying Party agree at
or prior to the expiration of the thirty-day period (or any mutually agreed upon
extension thereof) to the validity and amount of such claim, the Indemnifying
Party shall immediately pay to the Claimant the full amount of the claim,
subject to the terms hereof. If the Claimant and the Indemnifying Party do not
agree within thirty (30) days following receipt of notice of the claim from the
Claimant (or any mutually agreed upon extension thereof), the Claimant may seek
an appropriate remedy.

            (c) With respect to any claim by a third party as to which the
Claimant is entitled to indemnification under this Agreement, the Indemnifying
Party shall have the right, at its own expense, to participate in or assume
control of the defense of such claim, and the Claimant shall cooperate fully
with the Indemnifying Party, subject to reimbursement for actual out-of-pocket
expenses incurred by the Claimant as the result of a request by the Indemnifying
Party. If the Indemnifying Party elects to assume control of the defense of any
third-party claim, the Claimant shall have the right to participate in the
defense of such claim at its own expense; provided, however, that the
Indemnifying Party shall pay the Claimant's Expenses if, in the reasonable
judgment of Claimant's counsel, representation of both the Claimant and
Indemnifying Party with respect to such claim would result in a conflict of
interests or legal defenses and theories are available to Claimant that are not
available to the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party does not elect to
participate or assume control of the defense of any third-party claim, the
Claimant will not enter into any settlement of such claim which could result in
indemnification liability without the Indemnifying Party's prior written consent
(which shall not be unreasonably withheld). Any such settlement will be binding
upon Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, for purposes of determining whether
any indemnification payment is required pursuant to this Article 9.

            (a) by the mutual written consent of Seller and Buyer;

            (b) by either Buyer or Seller upon written notice to the other, in
the event that Buyer, in the case of a termination by Seller, or Seller, in the
case of a termination by Buyer, has materially breached its representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement and, if such
breach is capable of being cured, failed to cure such breach within thirty (30)
days of written notice by the terminating party of such breach; provided,
however, that the terminating party is not itself in material breach of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained herein;

            (c) by either Buyer or Seller upon written notice to the other, if a
court of competent jurisdiction shall have issued an order, decree or ruling

Seller Termination Event (as defined below); or

            (f) subject to Section 10.2, by either Buyer or Seller upon written
notice to the other party hereto if the Closing shall not have occurred on or
before the first anniversary of the date of this Agreement and Buyer, in the
case of a termination by Buyer, or Seller, in the case of a termination by
Seller, is not then in material breach of any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements under this Agreement.

petition in bankruptcy, or suffers the filing of an involuntary petition in
bankruptcy, or seeks protection from creditors under any state law provision, or
becomes subject to the appointment of a trustee or receiver over its assets; or
(4) if Buyer is not then in default or breach of its obligations hereunder, if
the conditions to Buyer's obligations contained in Article 7 hereof have not
been satisfied (or waived by Buyer) by the date scheduled for the Closing
pursuant to Section 3.1 (as such date may be postponed pursuant thereto).

      For the purposes of Section 10.1(e) above, "SELLER TERMINATION EVENT"
means any of the following: (1) failure of Buyer to pay the Purchase Price in

pursuant thereto).

      10.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of termination of this Agreement
by either party, all rights and obligations of the parties under this Agreement
shall terminate without any liability of either party to the other party (except
for any liability of either party for any breach of this Agreement, in which
case the non-breaching party shall have all rights and remedies available at law
or in equity), and all filings, applications and other submissions relating to
the transactions contemplated hereby shall, to the extent practicable, be
withdrawn from the Person to which made. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, the provisions of Sections 10.2, 11.1, 11.2, 11.3,
11.4, 11.5, 11.6, 11.7, 11.9, 11.11 and 11.12 shall expressly survive the
expiration or termination of this Agreement.

                                   ARTICLE 11

                               GENERAL PROVISIONS

      11.1 Confidential Nature of Information. Each party agrees that it shall,
and shall cause each of its Affiliates and its and their respective
shareholders, members, managers, directors, officers, employees, agents and
representatives (collectively, "REPRESENTATIVES") to, treat in confidence all
documents, materials and other information which it shall have obtained
regarding the other party during the course of the negotiations leading to the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (whether obtained before or
after the date of this Agreement), the investigation provided for herein and the
preparation of this Agreement and other related documents. Such documents,
materials and information shall not be communicated to any third Person, except
to employees, Representatives or Affiliates of Buyer or Seller with a need to
know and such Persons shall be informed of the confidential nature of such
information. No such Person shall use any such confidential information obtained
from the other in any manner whatsoever except solely for the purpose of
evaluating the proposed purchase and sale of the Licenses and consummating the
transactions contemplated hereby. The obligation of each party to treat such
documents, materials and other information in confidence, or to keep such
documents, materials and other information in confidence, shall not apply to any
information which (a) is or becomes available to a party hereto from a source
other than the other party hereto which source, to the knowledge of such party
hereto, is not bound by an obligation of confidentiality with respect to such
information, (b) is or becomes available to the public other than as a result of
disclosure by a party hereto or its Affiliates or Representatives, (c) is
required to be disclosed under applicable Law or judicial process, but only to
the extent it must be disclosed, (d) is independently developed by such party
without reference to the confidential information of the other party; or (e) a
party reasonably deems necessary to disclose to a Governmental Authority in
order to obtain any of the consents or approvals contemplated hereby. In the
event a party reasonably deems necessary the disclosure of this Agreement to a


                                     - 19 -
<PAGE>

Governmental Authority, the parties shall use reasonable commercial efforts to
secure confidential treatment of this Agreement by such Governmental Authority.

      11.2 No Public Announcement. No party shall, without the approval of the
other, make any press release or other public announcement concerning the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except as and to the extent that
any such party shall be so obligated by Law, in which case the other party shall
be advised and the parties shall use their reasonable efforts to cause a
mutually agreeable release or announcement to be issued; provided, that the
foregoing shall not preclude communications or disclosures necessary to
implement the provisions of this Agreement or to comply with accounting or
Securities and Exchange Commission disclosure obligations or applicable FCC
disclosure obligations, including in connection with obtaining the FCC Consent,
by a party or any of its Affiliates.

consent of the other party hereto.

            (b) This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of
the parties hereto and their successors and permitted assigns. Except as

Agreement.

Exhibits referred to herein and the documents delivered pursuant hereto contain

      11.6 Waivers. Any failure of either Buyer or Seller to comply with any
obligation, covenant, agreement or condition herein may be waived by the other
party only by a written instrument signed by the party granting such waiver, but
such waiver or failure to insist upon strict compliance with such obligation,
covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel
with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

pay all of its own costs and expenses incident to its negotiation and
preparation of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions

      11.8 Partial Invalidity. Wherever possible, each provision hereof shall be
interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable Law,
but in case any one or more of the provisions contained herein shall, for any
reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such
provision shall be ineffective to the extent, but only to the extent, of such
invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without invalidating the remainder of
such provision or provisions or any other provisions hereof; provided, however,
that if the removal of such offending term or provision materially alters the
burdens or benefits of any of the parties under this Agreement, the parties

Agreement are reasonably comparable to the burdens and benefits originally

and delivered to Seller.

deliver to Buyer, or cause to be executed and delivered to Buyer, such other
instruments of conveyance and transfer as Buyer may from time to time reasonably
request or as may be otherwise necessary to more effectively convey and transfer
the Licenses to Buyer, to vest title to the Licenses in Buyer, and to put the
Buyer in possession of any part of the Licenses.

construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,
