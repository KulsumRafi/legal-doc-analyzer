                          NOTICE REGARDING CONSENT OF
                       MEMBER FIRM OF ANDERSEN WORLDWIDE

     Section 11(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 provides that in case any part
of a registration statement, when such part became effective, contained an
untrue statement of a material fact, or omitted to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading, any person acquiring a security pursuant to such registration
statement (unless it is proved that at the time of such acquisition such person
knew of such untruth or omission) may sue, among others, an accountant who has
with his consent been named as having certified any part of the registration
statement, or as having prepared any report which is used in connection with the
registration statement.

     Until December 31, 2001, the consolidated financial statements filed in our
annual report on Form 20-F were audited by Barbier Frinault & Autres, a Member
Firm of Andersen Worldwide. After reasonable efforts, we have been unable to

any liability under Section 11(a) of the Securities Act for any untrue

Barbier Frinault & Autres or any omissions of a material fact required to be
