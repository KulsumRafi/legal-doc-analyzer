(including, without limitation, any Permitted Assignee) may not dispose of or distribute any of the real properties listed on Schedule&nbsp;A hereto (each a "Property" and collectively, the
"Properties") prior to the dates (for each Property, the "Restricted Period") determined from Schedule&nbsp;A with respect to each Property (which Schedule provides for an average Restricted Period
of approximately five (5)&nbsp;years following June&nbsp;27, 2000) without the express written consent of Martin S. Berger (the "RM Representative") (or, if he shall not be alive, his successor
selected by a majority of the remaining parties who received limited partnership interests ("Units") in MCRLP pursuant to the Agreement (the "Robert Martin Unit Holders")) except (i)&nbsp;in
connection with a tax-free transaction which does not result in recognition of any Built-in Gain (as defined below) by any Robert Martin Unit Holders listed on
Schedule&nbsp;B hereto (each a "RM Holder" and collectively, the "RM Holders"); (ii)&nbsp;in the event a taxable sale or disposition of any of the Properties would not result in recognition of any
Built-in Gain; (iii)&nbsp;in case of a disposition that is otherwise in compliance with the provisions of Section&nbsp;1.1.1 through Section&nbsp;1.1.9 hereof; (iv)&nbsp;if MCRC or
MCRLP promptly pays to the RM Holders an amount equal to the sum of (A)&nbsp;the federal, state, and local income taxes payable by the RM Holders resulting from the recognition of any
Built-in Gain triggered by such sale or disposition and (B)&nbsp;an additional payment in an amount equal to the amount such that after payment by the RM Holders of all taxes (including
interest or penalties) on amounts received under Section&nbsp;1.1.1 (iv)(A) and this Section&nbsp;1.1.1 (iv)(B) the RM Holders retain an amount equal to the amount described in
Section&nbsp;1.1.1 (iv)(A); or (v)&nbsp;a disposition of any Property which is subject to an option to purchase by a RM Holder to such RM Holder. For purposes of calculating the amounts payable
pursuant to clause&nbsp;(iv) of this Section&nbsp;1.1.1, the amount of taxes payable by a RM Holder shall be calculated by assuming a tax rate equal to the highest combined marginal rate of
federal, state and local tax applicable to an individual in the jurisdiction in which such RM Holder is a taxpayer (and if such taxpayer, either directly or indirectly, is subject to tax in more than
one state or local jurisdiction, the state or local tax rate to be used in the foregoing combined marginal rate shall be the highest rate of tax in such jurisdiction), and by assuming that such
individual has no tax attributes that would otherwise reduce such tax payments. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Built-in Gain" for any Property shall mean the excess, if any, of
the fair market value of such Property on the date such </FONT></P>

Property was contributed to MCRLP or its predecessor entity (as set forth in Schedule&nbsp;27.4 of the Agreement) over such Property's adjusted tax basis for federal income tax purposes on such
date. The RM Holders agree to cooperate with MCRC and MCRLP and their independent certified public accountants regarding the calculation of the amount of actual Built-in Gain attributable
to any Property recognized upon any transfer. In the event a Property is sold with the consent of Martin S. Berger or the RM Representative prior to the expiration of the Restricted Period determined
from Schedule&nbsp;A for such Property, then the Restricted Period for other Property or Properties (determined from Schedule&nbsp;A and designated by Martin S. Berger or the RM Representative)
having an Allocated Property Value approximately equal to the Allocated Property Value of the first Property being sold shall be extended for a time period equal to the period from the date on which
the sale of such Property closes to the end of the Restricted Period for such Property. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.1.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During
the Restricted Period, MCRC and MCRLP and their Subsidiaries and affiliates (including, without limitation, any Permitted Assignee), may dispose of any of the
Properties at any time in connection with (i)&nbsp;the sale of all or substantially all of the properties owned by MCRLP under such terms and conditions which the Board of Directors of MCRC
("Board"), in its sole judgment, determines to be in the best interests of MCRC and its public stockholders, or (ii)&nbsp;a sale (including without limitation a transfer to a secured lender in lieu
of foreclosure) which the Board, in its sole judgment, determines is reasonably necessary (1)&nbsp;to satisfy any material monetary default on any
unsecured debt, judgment or liability of MCRC, MCRLP or any Subsidiary or Permitted Assignee when they become due (at maturity or otherwise) or (2)&nbsp;to cure or satisfy any material monetary
default on any mortgage secured by a Property; </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>provided, however</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, that no such sales will be made under clause&nbsp;(ii) unless MCRLP is unable to
settle or refinance any such debts, judgments or liabilities, or cure or satisfy any such defaults, after making commercially reasonable efforts to do so under then prevailing market conditions. In
the event the Board, after MCRLP has made the commercially reasonable efforts described in the preceding sentence, in its sole judgment, determines that it is reasonably necessary to dispose of any of
the Properties to satisfy a material monetary default on any unsecured debt, judgment or liability of MCRLP when it becomes due (at maturity or otherwise), MCRLP covenants and agrees that it shall
treat all of its properties proportionately, including the Properties, in its determination of what properties to dispose of to satisfy such material debt, judgment or liability and shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to minimize any adverse tax consequences to holders of the Units, including the RM Holders, the holders of Units originating from the initial public offering of Cali
Realty Corporation on August&nbsp;31, 1994 (the "Cali Holders") and the holders of Units (the "Mack Group Holders") originating from that certain Contribution and Exchange Agreement among The MK
Contributors, the MK Entities, The Patriot Contributors, The Patriot Entities, Patriot American Management And Leasing Corp., Cali Realty, L.P. and Cali Realty Corporation dated September&nbsp;18,
1997 (the "Mack Contribution and Exchange Agreement"). Such proportionate treatment shall mean that the ratio of the unencumbered fair market value of the Properties that are sold over the
unencumbered fair market value of the total amount of property that are sold shall be no greater than the ratio of the unencumbered fair market value of the total Properties over the unencumbered fair
market value of the total properties owned by MCRLP, MCRC and their Subsidiaries. In the case of any disposition of any of the Properties pursuant to this Section&nbsp;1.1.2, the RM Holders may
attempt to obtain title to the Properties in question so long as any equity in the Properties which MCRLP may otherwise be seeking to preserve is not lost or jeopardized. Moreover, in the event of an
anticipated transfer of any of the Properties to a secured lender in lieu of foreclosure or foreclosure, MCRLP shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide the RM Holders the right to
(a)&nbsp;cure the default including the right to loan MCRLP the funds necessary to cure the default on an unsecured basis, as well as the right to loan such funds to MCRLP and to receive security
for any such loan from MCRLP (or its appropriate affiliate) in the form of a second mortgage secured solely by such Property (but only if the lender or lenders holding any prior mortgage or mortgages
on the relevant Property expressly consent in writing to the grant of the second mortgage, provided that </FONT></P>

such fraction's value being equal to one thousand ($1,000.00) dollars), such Property from MCRLP subject to the debt or liability; or (c)&nbsp;permit the RM Holders to exercise MCRLP's right of
redemption with respect to such Property; </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>provided, however</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, that MCRLP shall not have any obligation to grant the RM Holders the rights described in
clauses (a)&nbsp;and/or (b)&nbsp;of this sentence until the RM Holders (whose financial position and resources as determined by MCRLP using commercially reasonable standards to be satisfactory for
the purpose of acting as indemnitors pursuant to this provision) have agreed with MCRLP in writing to indemnify and hold harmless MCRLP, MCRC and their Subsidiaries and affiliates from and against all
costs (including reasonable attorneys fees), expenses, taxes (including without limitation any deed, mortgage or real estate transfer taxes), claims, judgments, liabilities or damages incurred or
arising from or in connection with or attributable to or resulting from the grant or exercise of such rights, or the acquisition of such Property by the RM Holders, but only to the extent such costs
would not have been incurred otherwise. </FONT></P>

shall use commercially reasonable efforts to prevent any such sale, transfer or other
disposition of the Properties, or any distribution of the Properties which is treated as a taxable disposition, from resulting in the recognition of Built-in Gain by the RM Holders, and </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><I>provided further</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>

the event MCRLP desires to sell or otherwise desires to dispose of, or receives an offer to purchase any of, the Properties pursuant to Sections 1.1.2 or 1.1.3
above, MCRLP shall give notice (the "Offering Notice") thereof to the RM Holders. The Offering Notice shall specify the nature of the sale, and the consideration and other terms upon which it intends
to undertake such sale. Within thirty (30)&nbsp;days thereafter, the RM Holders may elect, by notice to MCRLP, to purchase the Property which is the subject of the Offering Notice. If the RM Holders
elect to so purchase, then such purchase shall be consummated on the terms and conditions set forth in the Offering Notice; </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>provided, however</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, to the
extent that the Property in question is then subject to separately allocated debt and the lender thereof consents to the RM Holders assuming such debt, or acquiring such Property subject to such debt,
at no cost, expense or liability to MCRLP (or if there is any such cost, liability or expense, the RM Holders shall have reimbursed MCRLP for all such costs, liabilities or expenses and agreed in
writing with MCRLP to indemnify and hold harmless MCRLP from and against any additional costs, liabilities or expenses arising from or in connection with or attributable to (i)&nbsp;such assumption,
(ii)&nbsp;the acquisition of the Property subject to such debt or (iii)&nbsp;the payment of any such costs, liabilities or expenses, but only to the extent such costs would not have been incurred
otherwise), MCRLP will convey the Property subject to such debt. The RM Holders may use their Units as currency, in whole or in part, in connection with the purchase of any of the Property from MCRLP
pursuant to this Section&nbsp;1.1.4. In addition, as part of a transfer of any Property pursuant to Sections 1.1.2 (ii)(1) or (2), if the RM Holders can cause the third party which is otherwise to
obtain title to any Property to accept Units, in whole or in part, in lieu of obtaining title to such Property, the RM Holders shall have the right to do so provided that such third party agrees to be
bound by all of the terms and conditions of the OP Agreement and performs in accordance therewith, including, without limitation, performing the requirements pertaining to a transfer of Units (other
than the need to obtain the consent of the general partner of MCRLP, which consent is hereby deemed to be given); in such event, title to the Property which would otherwise have been transferred to
such third party shall be transferred to the RM Holders. If within the thirty (30)&nbsp;day period during which the RM Holders have the right to elect to purchase the Property for sale under the
Offering Notice, the RM Holders do not make the election or fail to respond to the Offering Notice, then MCRLP may undertake to sell such Property on such </FONT></P>

thirty (30)&nbsp;day period described above shall be reduced to ten (10)). If the RM Holders notify MCRLP of their intention not to purchase the Property as set forth in the revised Offering Notice,
then MCRLP may consummate the sale at any time thereafter, provided that such sale shall not be consummated at less than 95% of the price specified in the revised Offering Notice unless MCRLP again

the event that the RM Holders elect to purchase Property pursuant to Section&nbsp;1.1.4, MCRLP agrees to cooperate with the RM Holders, at no cost, expense or
liability to MCRLP, to cause debt to be placed on the Property immediately prior to the closing of the conveyance of said Property,
provided that (i)&nbsp;the RM Holders arrange for such debt at their sole cost and expense, (ii)&nbsp;the RM Holders are unconditionally prepared to close such conveyance immediately after said
closing of the loans, (iii)&nbsp;the RM Holders agree to assume the debt and thereafter assume same at the closing and (iv)&nbsp;MCRLP is released of all liability thereunder immediately following

order to allow the RM Holders to defer the recognition of gain for federal income tax purposes resulting from the contribution of property to MCRLP, MCRLP and its
affiliates will continue to permit the members of the RM Holders to guarantee, or indemnify MCRLP or MCRC for the bottom portion (i.e. the least risky portion) of the debt of MCRLP in the aggregate
amount of up to $184,000,000 (the "RM Debt Amount") in the same manner as currently provided to and </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>pari passu</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> with the Mack Group Holders and the Cali

Holder, or (iv)&nbsp;receives an allocation under Treas. Reg. Section&nbsp;1.704-3(b) using the "traditional method" without curative allocation that reduces the amount of any
