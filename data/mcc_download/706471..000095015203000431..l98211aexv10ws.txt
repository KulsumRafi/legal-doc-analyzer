         THIS AMENDMENT NO. 1 ("Amendment No. 1") dated as of April 30, 2002

                           1.1.1. Commitment. The Bank agrees, on the terms and
                  conditions of this Agreement and provided that no Event of
                  Default or Default (the definitions of those and other

                  Maturity Date.

                           1.1.2. Maximum Commitment. The Bank agrees to extend
                  the following credit term facilities: (a) a term loan (the
                  "Term Loan") in the original principal amount of $23,000,000,
                  evidenced by the Term Promissory Note dated as of the date
                  hereof in the amount of $23,000,000, payable by the Company to
                  the Bank in 12 equal quarterly installments of principal of
                  $600,000 plus interest commencing May 1, 2002 and terminating
                  on February 1, 2005 (the "Term Loan Maturity Date") pursuant
                  to the terms thereof and Section 1.4 hereof, as such Term Loan
                  Maturity Date may be extended pursuant to Section 1.1.4 hereof
                  (the "Term Note") and (b) a revolving loan in the original
                  principal amount of $12,800,000 pursuant to the terms of a
                  Revolving Credit Note dated as of the date hereof (the

                  "Notes"). The maximum amount of all outstanding Loans of the
                  Bank to the Company under this Agreement shall not exceed
                  $35,800,000 (the "Maximum Commitment"). The Maximum Commitment
                  of the Bank



<PAGE>

                  as adjusted from time to time is hereinafter called the
                  "Commitment" of the Bank.

                           1.1.3. Revolving Commitment. The $12,800,000
                  available to the Company under the Revolving Note shall be
                  hereinafter called the "Revolving Commitment." As of the
                  Revolving Credit Maturity Date, the Bank shall have no further
                  obligation to fund any Revolving Credit Loans under this
                  Agreement. Any amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit
                  Note shall become due and payable on February 1, 2005
                  ("Revolving Credit Maturity Date") pursuant to the terms
                  thereof and Section 1.4 hereof, as such Revolving Credit
                  Maturity Date may be extended pursuant to Section 1.1.5
                  hereof. No Commitment shall become effective until each of the
                  parties hereto shall have executed this Agreement or a
                  counterpart hereof.

                           1.1.4. Term Note Extension. The Term Loan may, at the
                  option of the Bank, be extended for a 12 month period on each
                  February 1, commencing February 1, 2003. If the Bank agrees to
                  extend the Term Loan or fails to deliver a notice of
                  non-extension by February 1, then the Term Loan Maturity Date
                  will be automatically redefined to mean the date one year
                  hence (i.e., February 1, 2005 to February 1, 2006). If the
                  Bank delivers a notice of non-extension on or before any
                  February 1, then the Term Loan Maturity Date shall be
                  automatically extended to the date 36 months after the then
                  existing Term Loan Maturity Date (the "Former Term Loan
                  Maturity Date") (i.e., February 1, 2005 to February 1, 2008),
                  and the Term Loan shall become payable in $600,000
                  installments (commencing on the May 1 occurring immediately
                  after the delivery of the Bank's notice of non-extension)
                  until the Former Term Loan Maturity Date, at which time the
                  quarterly installments will be paid in 12 installments equal
                  to the amount of principal outstanding on the Former Term Loan
                  Maturity Date divided by 12, so that the Term Loan shall be
                  paid in full when the final equal quarterly installment is
                  made on the extended Term Loan Maturity Date.

                           1.1.5. Revolving Commitment; Extension and
                  Conversion. The Revolving Commitment may, at the option of the
                  Bank, be extended for a 12 month period on each February 1,
                  commencing February 1, 2003.

                                    (a) If the Bank agrees to extend the
                  Revolving Commitment or fails to deliver a notice of
                  non-extension by February 1, then the Revolving Credit
                  Maturity Date will be automatically redefined to mean the date
                  one year hence (i.e., from February 1, 2005 to February 1,
                  2006).

                                    (b) If the Bank delivers a notice of
                  non-extension on or before any February 1, then the Revolving
                  Credit Maturity Date shall not be further extended, and the
                  Company shall have the option to (i) pay off the remaining
                  principal balance on the Revolving Credit Maturity Date or
                  (ii) if the Company sends a conversion notice to the Bank by
                  the March 1 occurring immediately after the Company's receipt
                  of a notice of non-extension, to convert the Revolving Credit
                  Commitment to a term loan, in



<PAGE>

                  which case the balance of the Revolving Note shall
                  automatically convert to a term obligation with a maturity 60
                  months thereafter (the "Extended Maturity Date"), and in which
                  case the Company shall pay the remaining principal balance
                  over the extended term, with equal installments due each
                  quarter (commencing on the May 1 occurring immediately after
                  the delivery of the Bank's notice of non-extension) in an
                  amount equal to the then-remaining (i.e., March 1) principal
                  balance divided by 20, so that the obligations incurred under
                  the Revolving Note shall be paid in full when the final equal
                  quarterly payment is made on the Extended Maturity Date.

         1.2. Section 1.2 is amended and restated in its entirety as follows:

                  1.2 Cancellation or Reduction of the Commitment by the
                  Company. During the period from and including the date of this
                  Agreement to but excluding the later of the Term Loan Maturity
                  Date (as extended) or the Revolving Credit Maturity Date (or
                  the Extended Maturity Date), the Commitment of the Bank may,
                  subject to the payment of the Interest Preservation Amount
                  described in Section 1.5, be cancelled or may be reduced
                  permanently from time to time by the Company in the amount of
                  $100,000 or any larger amount which is a whole multiple of
                  $100,000 upon 10 Banking Days' written notice to the Bank of
                  the Company's election to do so, which notice shall specify
                  the date when such cancellation or reduction shall be
                  effective and on the effective date of such reduction the
                  Commitment of the Bank shall be reduced; provided that-

                           (a) any such cancellation or reduction shall be
                  irrevocable;

                           (b) in the event of a cancellation of the Commitment
                  of the Bank, (i) the Notes shall be paid in full, (ii) all
                  Commitment Fees due to the date of cancellation shall be paid
                  in full and (iii) all expenses due pursuant to Section 10.7
                  hereof shall be paid in full; and

                           (c) in the event of a reduction of the Commitment of
                  the Bank to an amount less than the principal amount then
                  outstanding hereunder, the Notes shall be prepaid so that the
                  unpaid aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding
                  Loans does not exceed the Commitment of the Bank as so
                  reduced.

         1.3. Section 1.3(c) is amended and restated in its entirety as follows:

                           (c) Agency Fee. As consideration for the Bank
                  agreeing to serve as agent and participate a portion of the
                  Commitment, the Company shall pay to the Bank an Agency Fee of
                  $25,000 on each November 1 thereafter until the later of the
                  Term Loan Maturity Date (as extended) or the Revolving Credit
                  Maturity Date (or the Extended Maturity Date).

         1.4. Section 1.4(a) is amended and restated in its entirety as follows:

                  1.4 The Notes.



<PAGE>

                           (a) Form. The Loans made by the Bank pursuant hereto
                  shall be evidenced by the Revolving Note of the Company
                  substantially in the form of Exhibit A-6 and the Term Note of
                  the Company substantially in the form of Exhibit A-7, payable
                  to the order of the Bank and representing the obligation of
                  the Company to pay the amount of the Commitment or, if less,
                  the aggregate unpaid principal amount of all Loans made by the
                  Bank, with interest thereon as prescribed in this Section 1.4.
                  The Notes shall (i) be dated the date of this Agreement, (ii)
                  be stated to mature on the respective Maturity Dates; and
                  (iii) bear interest at the applicable interest rate per annum
                  as provided in, and payable as specified in this Section 1.4.
                  Each Loan made by the Bank and each payment made on account of
                  principal on the Notes shall be recorded by the Bank, on its
                  books and records or endorsed on the grid attached to the
                  applicable Note, such books and records or endorsements to
                  constitute prima-facie evidence of the amount of all Loans and
                  payments; provided, however, that the failure of the Bank to
                  make such recordation shall not limit or otherwise affect the
                  obligations of the Company under the Notes.

         1.5. Section 1.4(d) is amended and restated in its entirety as follows:

                           (d) Principal. Principal on the Loans shall be due
                  and payable pursuant to the terms of the Notes and shall be
                  due and payable in full on the respective Maturity Dates;
                  provided, however, that any Excess Cash Flow payments the
                  Company makes shall be applied to principal reduction of the
                  Term Note in the inverse order of maturity. The Company shall
                  be required to make additional principal payments on the Term
                  Loan based on the annual Net Income of the Company, commencing
                  for the fiscal year ending in 2003. The Company shall pay an
                  amount (the "Excess Cash Flow") equal to forty percent (40%)
                  of the Company's annual Net Income that exceeds the amount of
                  principal paid by the Company on the Term Loan during such
                  fiscal year multiplied by 1.5; provided, however, that such
                  payment shall never be greater than $500,000 for any fiscal
                  year. The Company shall pay the Excess Cash Flow on the
                  February 1 occurring immediately after each fiscal year end.
                  The Company shall be required to pay any Excess Cash Flow to
                  the Bank.

         1.6. Section 1.5 is amended and restated in its entirety as follows:

                           1.5 Prepayments and Right to Reborrow. Except as set
                  forth below, outstanding Loans may be prepaid in whole at any
                  time or in part from time to time without premium or penalty.
                  No prepayment shall affect the Company's right to reborrow
                  from the Bank under the Revolving Commitment of the Bank up to
                  the permissible amount hereunder prior to the Revolving Credit
                  Maturity Date. The Company may prepay all or any portion of
                  the principal amount of the Loans bearing interest at a LIBOR
                  Rate, provided that if the Company makes any such prepayment
                  other than on the last day of an Interest Period, the Company
                  shall pay all accrued interest on the principal amount prepaid
                  with such prepayment and, on demand, shall reimburse the Bank
                  and hold the Bank harmless from all losses and expenses
                  incurred by the Bank as a result of such prepayment,
                  including, without limitation, any losses and expenses arising
                  from the



<PAGE>

                  liquidation or reemployment of deposits acquired to fund or
                  maintain the principal amount prepaid. Such reimbursement
                  shall be calculated as though the Bank funded the principal
                  amount prepaid through the purchase of U.S. Dollar deposits in
                  the London, England interbank market having a maturity
                  corresponding to such Interest Period and bearing an interest
                  rate equal to the LIBOR Rate for such Interest Period, whether
                  in fact that is the case or not. The Bank 's determination of
                  the amount of such reimbursement shall be conclusive in the
                  absence of manifest error.

         1.7. Section 1.7(A) is amended and restated in its entirety as follows:

                  1.7 Letters of Credit.

                                    (A) The Company may request a Letter of
                  Credit by completing the Bank's then standard application for
                  a Letter of Credit and delivering the application to the Bank
                  at least two days before the date on which the Letter of
                  Credit is to be issued. On the date the Letter of Credit is to
                  be issued, the Bank shall deliver the Letter of Credit to the
                  Company, or to the Person designated by the Company. No Letter
                  of Credit shall be issued with an expiration date after the
                  Revolving Credit Maturity Date or which is payable in a
                  currency other than United States dollars. Except as otherwise
                  provided herein, all the terms of the Letter of Credit and
                  such standard application shall govern the Letter of Credit.
                  The amount of each Letter of Credit must be approved by the
                  Bank (provided that there shall never be more than $500,000 in
                  face amount of Letters of Credit outstanding), and the Bank
                  may disapprove a Letter of Credit request at any time for any
                  reason. The Revolving Commitment shall be reduced by the face
                  amount of any Letter of Credit.

         1.8. Section 5.4 is amended and restated in its entirety as follows:

                           5.4 Quarterly Compliance Certificate. The quarterly
                  and annual financial statements furnished pursuant to Sections
                  5.2 and 5.3 shall be accompanied by a certificate of the chief
                  financial officer of the Company:

                                    (a) No Event of Default. Stating that except
                  as disclosed in the certificate, such officer, after
                  reasonable investigation, has no knowledge of any (i) Event of
                  Default or (ii) Default;

                                    (b) Financial Ratios. Setting forth, in

                  during such accounting Period) in respect of the restrictions
                  contained in Sections 6.2 and 6.3 hereof; and

                                    (c) Interest Rate. Setting forth, in summary
                  form, calculations showing the ratio set forth in Section
                  1.4(b).

         1.9. Sections 6.2(b), 6.2(c), 6.2(e) and 6.2(f) are hereby amended and
