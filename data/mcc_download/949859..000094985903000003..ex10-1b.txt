any security agreement, guaranty or other undertaking affecting this Note, shall
operate as a waiver of such right or any other right under this Note,  nor shall
any  omission  in  exercising  any right on the part of the Bank under this Note

circumstance  is held invalid or  unenforceable,  the remainder of this Note and
the application of such provision to other parties or circumstances  will not be
affected  thereby and the provisions of this Note shall be severable in any such

conditions  under which the due date of this Note or any payment  thereon may be
accelerated  or is  automatically  accelerated,  or under which this Note may be
prepaid or is required to be prepaid.  All capitalized  terms used herein shall,
unless  otherwise  defined  herein,  have  the  meanings  set  forth in the Loan
Agreement.  The holder of this Note is entitled to all of the benefits  provided
in said Loan  Agreement  and the Loan  Documents  referred  to herein.  Borrower

     Except  as set forth in the Loan  Agreement,  Borrower,  endorsers  and all
other parties to this Note waive presentment,  demand,  notice,  protest and all
other  demands  and  notices  in  connection  with  the  delivery,   acceptance,
performance,  default or enforcement of this Note and the Loan Agreement. In any
action on this Note, the Bank or its assignee need not file the original of this
Note,  but need only file a photocopy of this Note certified by the Bank or such

     This is the Second Term Note referred to in the Loan  Agreement.  This Note

     No delay on the part of the Bank in  exercising  any right under this Note,
any security agreement, guaranty or other undertaking affecting this Note, shall
operate as a waiver of such right or any other right under this Note,  nor shall
any  omission  in  exercising  any right on the part of the Bank under this Note
operate as a waiver of any other rights.

     Upon the  occurrence  and  during the  continuation  of an Event of Default
under the Loan  Agreement  and the  expiration of any  applicable  grace or cure
periods under the Loan Agreement, the outstanding indebtedness evidenced by this
Note, together with all accrued interest, shall be due and payable in accordance
with the terms of the Loan  Agreement,  without  notice  to or  demand  upon any
Borrower except as otherwise set forth in the Loan  Agreement,  and the Bank may
exercise all of its rights and remedies  reserved to it under the Loan Agreement
or applicable law.

     If any  provision of this Note or the  application  thereof to any party of
circumstance  is held invalid or  unenforceable,  the remainder of this Note and
the application of such provision to other parties or circumstances  will not be
affected  thereby and the provisions of this Note shall be severable in any such
instance.

     This Note shall be in replacement of and in  substitution  for that certain
Second  Term Note  dated  May 17,  2001,  in the  original  principal  amount of
$5,773,336.00,  made by Borrower and payable to the order of Bank (the "Original
Note").   The  indebtedness   evidenced  by  the  Original  Note  is  continuing
indebtedness,  and  nothing  herein  shall be deemed to  constitute  a  payment,
settlement  or  novation  of the  Original  Note,  or to  release  or  otherwise
adversely  affect  any  lien,   mortgage  or  security  interest  securing  such
indebtedness  or any rights of the Bank against any  guarantor,  surety or other
party primarily or secondarily liable for such indebtedness.

     BORROWER HEREBY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH BORROWER MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO
SUBMIT  ANY  CLAIM,  ISSUE OR  DEFENSE  ARISING  HEREUNDER  OR UNDER  THE  OTHER
DOCUMENTS RELATING TO THIS NOTE TO A TRIAL BY JURY.
