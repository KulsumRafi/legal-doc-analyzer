<p></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(h)&nbsp;&nbsp;Those matters are set forth in <b><u>Schedule A</u></b> attached hereto and

<p></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.&nbsp;&nbsp;TITLE.</p>

<p></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A.&nbsp;&nbsp;TITLE DEFECT.&nbsp;&nbsp;If because of a defect in the
title to the Premises Seller shall be unable on the date of closing to convey title as required hereunder, the closing date shall
be extended for a period of not more than thirty (30) days to permit Seller to perfect title.&nbsp; If at the end of said thirty
(30) day period Seller, after using its best efforts, shall not have perfected title, then the Buyer may elect to accept such title
as Seller can convey upon payment of the purchase price or Buyer, on that ground, may reject acceptance of the deed of
conveyance.&nbsp; Upon such rejection all sums paid hereunder by Buyer shall be repaid by Seller to Buyer.&nbsp; Upon receipt of
such payment by Buyer or Buyer's attorney, this Agreement shall terminate and become null and void and the parties hereto shall be
released and discharged of all further claims and obligations each to the other hereunder.</p>

<p></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is agreed that no matter shall be considered to be a defect in
title if under applicable provisions of the Standards of Title of the Connecticut Bar Association such matter is not considered to
be a defect in title without curative action or if a title insurance company licensed to do business in Connecticut will issue a
commitment to provide an owner's and mortgagee's policy at standard rates without exception for such item or insuring against loss
or damage arising therefrom.</p>

<p></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B.&nbsp;&nbsp;TITLE SEARCH AND CERTIFICATION;
SURVEY.&nbsp;&nbsp;Buyer shall procure at its expense any title search, title certification, or survey desired by it or any lender
providing mortgage financing for this transaction.&nbsp; The Buyer shall deliver to Seller a copy of said title search or
certification within thirty (30) days after the date of this Agreement and shall simultaneously give Seller written notice of any
title defect or any encumbrance which is unsatisfactory to Buyer.&nbsp; The Buyer shall be deemed to have waived objection to any
title defect not specified in such notice that is either set forth in such title search or certification, or is otherwise known to
Buyer.</p>

<p></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9.&nbsp;&nbsp;SELLER'S AFFIDAVIT.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Seller agrees to execute, at the time of closing
of title, an affidavit (a) verifying the non-existence of mechanics' and materialmen's liens (or Waiver of Mechanic's Lien as
provided in the following section), (b) verifying the non-existence of any tenants' rights, except as set forth herein, (c)
verifying the non-existence of any security interests in personal property and fixtures being sold with the Premises, (d) that the
Seller has no notice of any facts or circumstances not of record which could give rise to the claim of any third party to rights of
adverse possession or use over the Premises or any part thereof in derogation of Seller's title, and (e) to the extent of Seller's
knowledge, updating any available survey, which survey Seller agrees to provide to Buyer on or before closing.</p>

<p></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10.&nbsp;&nbsp;WAIVER OF MECHANIC'S LIEN.&nbsp;&nbsp;If any work has been done or material
furnished on the Premises within ninety (90) days prior to closing on behalf of Seller for which a lien could be filed, the Seller
agrees to deliver to the Buyer at the closing evidence of payment of such claims or absolute waivers of mechanic's liens.&nbsp;
Failure to do so shall constitute a representation that no such work has been done nor any materials furnished.</p>

<p></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11.&nbsp;&nbsp;CONTINGENCIES.&nbsp;&nbsp;Buyer's obligations hereunder shall be contingent upon
satisfaction of the following contingencies:</p>

<p></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A.&nbsp;&nbsp;Environmental Contingency.&nbsp;&nbsp;Buyer shall be
entitled at its option and at its sole expense to conduct an environmental investigation of the Premises for the purposes of
verifying the absence of hazardous waste on the Premises at levels above those allowed under applicable state and Federal
law.&nbsp; If Buyer's inspection of the Premises reveals levels of hazardous waste above those allowed, it shall so notify the
Seller or Seller's attorney in writing on or before five (5) business days from May 1, 2002 (the "Environmental Contingency Date"),
whereupon (subject to the terms of Section 11C hereof) this Agreement shall terminate, all deposit monies shall be refunded to
Buyer, and this Agreement shall be of no further force or effect and Seller and Buyer shall be discharged of all liability, each to
the other, hereunder.&nbsp; Seller agrees to cooperate with Buyer in providing access to the Premises for such investigation, and
Seller shall at Buyer's request execute and deliver to Buyer such evidence of Buyer's authorization to conduct such investigation
as Buyer reasonably deems necessary.&nbsp; If Seller or Seller's attorney does not receive such written notice on or before the
Environmental Contingency Date, this contingency shall be deemed to be fulfilled and this Agreement shall remain in full force and
effect.</p>

<p></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B.&nbsp;&nbsp;Inspection Contingency.&nbsp;&nbsp;Buyer shall be
entitled at its sole expense to conduct an inspection of the Premises for the purposes of satisfying itself as to the condition of
the Premises, including without limitation as to zoning matters.&nbsp; If Buyer's inspection of the Premises reveals conditions
unsatisfactory to the Buyer in its reasonable discretion, it shall so notify the Seller or Seller's attorney in writing on or
before five (5) business days from May 1, 2002 (the "Inspection Contingency Date"), whereupon (subject to the terms of Section 11C
hereof) this Agreement shall terminate, all deposit monies shall be refunded to Buyer, and this Agreement shall be of no further
force or effect and Seller and Buyer shall be discharged of all liability, each to the other, hereunder.&nbsp; Seller agrees to
cooperate with Buyer in providing access to the Premises and to any surveys or reports pertaining to the Premises in Seller&rsquo;s
possession, and Seller shall at Buyer's request execute and deliver to Buyer such evidence of Buyer's authorization to conduct such
inspection as Buyer reasonably deems necessary.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Seller or Seller's attorney does not receive such written
notice on or before the Inspection Contingency Date, this contingency shall be deemed to be fulfilled and this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect.</p>

<p></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C.&nbsp;&nbsp;Seller's Right to Cure.&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event that Buyer exercises its rights under any of the foregoing contingencies to terminate this Agreement,
Seller shall at its option have an opportunity to cure or remedy the condition or conditions causing the failure of the
contingency.&nbsp; If Seller desires to effectuate such a cure, it shall give written notice to Buyer of its intent to do so within
five (5) business days following Buyer's notice to Seller of its intent to terminate the Agreement, and thereafter, Seller shall
have a period of thirty (30) days to effectuate such cure to the Buyer's reasonable satisfaction.&nbsp; If at the end of such
thirty (30) day period, Seller has not succeeded in curing the failed contingency to the Buyer's reasonable satisfaction, all
deposit monies shall be refunded to Buyer, and this Agreement shall be of not further force and effect and Seller and Buyer
shall&nbsp; be discharged of all liability, each to the other, hereunder.</p>

<p></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D.&nbsp;&nbsp;Access To Premises.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Buyer, its
employees and agents, at the Buyer's sole cost and expense, shall have the right to enter upon the Premises from time to time prior
to the closing date for the purpose of fulfilling the contingencies set forth in Sections 11A and 11B above.&nbsp; The Buyer shall
give the Seller prior notice of its entry upon the Premises and shall coordinate such entry and inspections with the Seller so that
the entry is at a mutually convenient time. The Buyer shall upon request provide certificates of insurance to the Seller evidencing
liability insurance in the minimum amount of $1,000,000 combined per occurrence limit carried by the Buyer and/or the Buyer's
agents in order to insure any loss arising out of or in connection with entry upon the Premises.&nbsp; The aforesaid insurance
shall be issued by an insurance company licensed in the State of Connecticut and said insurance company shall be acceptable to the
Seller.&nbsp; Upon completion of any inspections, the Buyer shall restore the Premises to the condition in which it existed prior
to said inspections.&nbsp; The Buyer shall and hereby does indemnify, defend, and save harmless the Seller from and against any and
all claims arising out of the entry on and inspection of the Premises by the Buyer and/or the Buyer's employees and agents,
including, without limitation, the Seller's attorneys' fees and costs.&nbsp; Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement
to the contrary, the terms of this paragraph shall survive (i) closing and the delivery of the deed; and (ii) the termination of
this Agreement.</p>

<p></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12.&nbsp;&nbsp;RISK OF LOSS.&nbsp;&nbsp;If a condemnation proceeding is instituted against the
Premises or any portion thereof, or if all or a portion of the Premises is substantially damaged by fire or other casualty, prior
to closing, and if the Seller does not at its option agree to repair or replace any such loss or damage, the Buyer may terminate
this Agreement upon written notice to the Seller, whereupon the Seller shall return the deposit monies to the Buyer and the parties
shall have no further liabilities or obligations hereunder.&nbsp; If the Buyer does not so terminate this Agreement, this Agreement
shall continue to be effective, and the Seller shall assign to the Buyer at closing all of the Seller's right to receive any award
for such condemnation or insurance proceeds as a result of such damage (as the case may be), together with all of the Seller's
rights to litigate such claim and to negotiate a settlement with the condemning authority or the insurance carrier.</p>

<p></p>

the Buyer, (i) the return by the Seller of the Buyer of the deposit monies (in which case this Agreement shall become null and
void, and the parties shall have no further liabilities or obligations hereunder), or (ii) a suit by the Buyer against the Seller
for specific performance only.</p>

<p></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Buyer materially breaches this Agreement prior

for such breach, in which event this Agreement shall become null and void, and the parties shall have no further liabilities or
obligations hereunder; or (ii) as monies to be applied to the Seller's damages to be sought by Seller in a suit against Buyer.</p>

attention to said Premises, showed them to it or any representative of it or in any manner dealt with it or them or been
instrumental in effecting this transaction.&nbsp; The Buyer agrees to save the Seller harmless from any loss, expense or liability
from any commission claim by any broker or agent by virtue of alleged dealings had by such claimant with the Buyer or a
representative of the Buyer, provided the Buyer shall be notified immediately of any such claim and may undertake the defense
thereof.&nbsp; The Seller represents to the Buyer that it has not entered into any listing agreement with any agent or broker which
would entitle such agent or broker to a commission in connection with this transaction.&nbsp; The Seller agrees to save the Buyer
harmless from any loss, expense or liability from any commission claim by any broker or agent by virtue of any such listing
agreement.</p>
