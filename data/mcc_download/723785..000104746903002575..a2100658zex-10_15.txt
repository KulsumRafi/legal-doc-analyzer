     which differ materially from those ordinarily found to exist and generally
     recognized as inherent at facilities similar to MedQuest. Whether a
     condition is materially different shall be subject to agreement by the
     parties, but in no event shall a condition be considered materially

     agrees that it will not in the course of its business relationship with the
     other under the terms of this Agreement or thereafter, divulge, disclose or
     communicate to anyone, without the express written authorization of the

     the other party may have acquired, directly or indirectly, during the
     course of this business relationship. In addition, each party agrees to
