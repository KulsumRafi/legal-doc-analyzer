         of Section 3.3, the number of Shares deliverable under the Plan may not

         the case may be, shall again be available for Awards under the Plan.

         3.3 Adjustments. Subject to Section 5.3, in the event of any change in
         the outstanding Common Stock by reason of a stock split, stock

         sole discretion and any such adjustment shall be binding and conclusive
         on all parties. Any fractional Shares resulting from any such
         adjustment shall be disregarded.

Awards

                                       7
<PAGE>
under the terms of this Plan is made at the discretion of the Committee and does
not entitle a Participant to receive future Awards. The adoption of this Plan
shall not be deemed to give any Employee any right to be granted an Award,
except to the extent as may be determined by the Committee.

Section 5.        Administration.

         5.1. Committee. The Plan and all Awards granted pursuant hereto shall
         be administered by the Committee, which has sole and absolute
         discretion with respect to all decisions and determinations pertaining

                  such grants;

                  (b) determine the terms, conditions and provisions of, and
                  restrictions relating to, each Award granted;

                  (i) employ agents, attorneys, accountants or other persons for
                  such purposes as the Committee considers necessary or
                  desirable; and

                  (j) do and perform all acts which it may deem necessary or
                  appropriate for the administration of the Plan and to carry
                  out the objectives of the Plan.

         5.3. Additional Terms. The Committee may: (i) modify or restrict
         exercise procedures and any other Plan procedures; (ii) establish local
         country plans as subplans to this Plan, each of which may be attached
         as an Appendix hereto and to the extent that the Committee determines
         that the restrictions imposed by the

                                       8
<PAGE>
         Plan preclude the achievement of the material purposes of the Awards in
         jurisdictions outside the United States under such a subplan, the
         Committee will have the authority and discretion to modify those
         restrictions as the Committee determines to be necessary or appropriate
         to conform to applicable requirements or practices of jurisdictions
         outside the United States; (iii) take any action, before or after an

         violate any securities law or any governing statute; and (iv) in the
         event of an extraordinary dividend or other distribution, merger,
         reorganization, consolidation, combination, sale of assets, split up,
         exchange, or spin off, or other extraordinary corporate transaction,
         the Committee may, in such manner and to such extent (if any) as it
         deems appropriate and equitable make provision for a cash payment or
         for the substitution or exchange of any or all outstanding Awards of
         the cash, securities or property deliverable to the holder of any or
         all outstanding Awards based upon the distribution or consideration
         payable to holders of Common Stock upon or in respect of such event.

         5.4. Delegation. The Committee may delegate to appropriate senior
         officers of the Company, or such other persons or committees as it
         deems appropriate, its duties under the Plan pursuant to such
         conditions and limitations as the Committee may establish.

         5.5. Determinations. All determinations, interpretations, or other
         actions made or taken by the Committee pursuant to the provisions of
         the Plan shall be final, binding, and conclusive for all purposes and
         upon all persons. Neither the Committee nor the Board, nor any member
         of the Committee or the Board or anyone acting at the direction of the
         Committee or the Board, shall be liable for any action or determination
         made hereunder in good faith.

Section 6.  Stock Options.

         6.1. Type of Option. It is intended that only non-qualified stock
         options may be granted by the Committee under this Section 6 of the
         Plan.

         6.2. Grant of Option. An Option may be granted to Participants at such
         time or times as shall be determined by the Committee. Each Option
         shall be evidenced by a certificate, notice or agreement that shall
         specify the exercise price, the duration of the Option, the number of
         Shares to which the Option applies, and such other terms and conditions
         not inconsistent with the Plan as the Committee shall determine.

         6.3. Option Price. The per-share Option price shall be at least 100% of
         the Fair Market Value at the time the Option is granted.

                                       9
<PAGE>
         6.4. Exercise of Options. Options awarded under the Plan shall be
         exercisable at such times and shall be subject to such restrictions and
         conditions, including the performance of a minimum period of service
         after the grant, as the Committee may impose, which need not be uniform
         for all Participants; provided, however, that no Option shall be
         exercisable for more than ten (10) years after the date on which it is
         granted.

         6.5. Payment. The Committee shall determine the procedures governing
         the exercise of Options, and shall require that the per-share option
         price be paid in full at the time of exercise. The per-share option
         price shall be payable in full either: (a) in cash or its equivalent
         (acceptable cash equivalents shall be determined by the Committee); (b)
         unless otherwise determined by the Committee, by tendering previously
         acquired shares of Common Stock having an aggregate Fair Market Value
         at the time of exercise equal to the total option exercise price
         (provided that the shares of Common Stock which are tendered must have
         been held by the Participant for at least six (6) months prior to their
         tender); (c) unless otherwise determined by the Committee, pursuant to
         a "cashless exercise" procedure, as permitted under United States
         Federal Reserve Board's Regulation T, subject to securities law
         restrictions; (d) by a combination of (a), (b) and (c); or (e) by any
         other means which the Committee determines to be consistent with the
         Plan's purpose and applicable law.

         6.6. Rights as a Shareholder. Until the exercise of an Option and the
         delivery of the Shares in respect thereof, a Participant shall have no
         rights as a Shareholder with respect to the Shares covered by such
         Option.

Section 7.  Stock Appreciation Rights.

         7.1. Grant of Stock Appreciation Rights. Stock Appreciation Rights may
         be granted to Participants at such time or times as shall be determined
         by the Committee and shall be subject to such terms and conditions as
         the Committee may decide. A grant of an SAR shall be made pursuant to a
         certificate, notice or agreement containing such provisions not
         inconsistent with the Plan as the Committee shall approve.

         7.2. Exercise of SARs. SARs may be exercised at such times and subject
         to such conditions, including the performance of a minimum period of
         service, as the Committee shall impose. SARs that are granted in tandem
         with an Option may only be exercised upon the surrender of the right to
         exercise an equivalent number of Shares under the related Option and
         may be exercised only with respect to the Shares for which the related
         Option is then exercisable. Notwithstanding any other provision of the
         Plan, the Committee may impose conditions on the exercise of an SAR,
         including, without limitation, the right of the Committee to limit the
         time of exercise to specified periods.


                                       10
<PAGE>
         7.3. Payment of SAR Amount. Upon exercise of an SAR, the Participant
         shall be entitled to receive payment of an amount determined by
         multiplying:

                  (a) any increase in the Fair Market Value of a Share at the
                  date of exercise over the Fair Market Value of a Share at the
                  date of grant, by

                  (b) the number of Shares with respect to which the SAR is
                  exercised;

         provided, however, that at the time of grant, the Committee may
         establish, in its sole discretion, a maximum amount per Share which
         will be payable upon exercise of an SAR.

         7.4. Method of Payment. Subject to the discretion of the Committee,
         which may be exercised at the time of grant, the time of payment, or
         any other time, payment of an SAR may be made in cash, Shares or any
         combination thereof.

Section 8.  Restricted Stock or Phantom Stock.

         8.1. Grant of Restricted Stock or Phantom Stock. The Committee may
         grant Shares of Restricted Stock or Phantom Stock rights to such
         Participants at such times and in such amounts, and subject to such
         other terms and conditions not inconsistent with the Plan as it shall
         determine. Each grant of Restricted Stock or Phantom Stock rights shall
         be evidenced by a certificate, notice or agreement setting forth the
         terms of such Award.

         8.2. Restrictions on Transferability. Restricted Stock or Phantom Stock
         rights may not be sold, transferred, pledged, assigned, or otherwise
         alienated until such time, or until the satisfaction of such conditions
         as shall be determined by the Committee (including without limitation,
         the satisfaction of performance goals, the occurrence of such events as
         shall be determined by the Committee, or pursuant to a determination
         under Section 15.1). At the end of the Period of Restriction applicable
         to any Restricted Stock, such Shares will be transferred to the
         Participant free of all restrictions. At the end of the restriction
         period applicable to Phantom Stock, payment shall be made in the manner
         set forth in the applicable award agreement.

         8.3. Rights as a Shareholder. Unless otherwise determined by the
         Committee at the time of grant, Participants holding Restricted Stock
         granted hereunder may exercise full voting rights and other rights as a
         Shareholder with respect to those Shares during the Period of
         Restriction. Holders of Phantom Stock rights shall not be deemed
         Shareholders and, except to the extent provided in accordance with the
         Plan, shall have no rights related to any Shares.

         8.4. Dividends and Other Distributions. Unless otherwise determined by
         the Committee at the time of grant, Participants holding Restricted
         Stock shall be entitled to receive all dividends and other
         distributions paid with respect to those

                                       11
<PAGE>

         Shares, provided that if any such dividends or distributions are paid
         in shares of stock, such shares shall be subject to the same forfeiture
         restrictions and restrictions on transferability as apply to the
         Restricted Stock with respect to which they were paid. Unless otherwise
         determined by the Committee at the time of grant, Participants holding
         shares of Phantom Stock shall be entitled to receive cash payments
         equal to any cash dividends and other distributions paid with respect
         to a corresponding number of Shares; provided, however, that if any
         such dividends or distributions are paid in Shares, the Fair Market
         Value of such Shares shall be converted into shares of Phantom Stock
         which shall be subject to the same forfeiture restrictions and
         restrictions on transferability as apply to the shares of Phantom Stock
         with respect to which they are paid.

         8.5. Payment of Phantom Stock Rights. The Committee may, at the time of
         grant, provide for other methods of payment in respect of Phantom Stock
         rights in cash, Shares, partially in cash and partially in Shares, or
         in any other manner not inconsistent with this Plan.

Section 9.  Awards of Stock.

Subject to the provisions of the Plan, Shares of Stock may be awarded to
Participants in such number, upon such terms, and at such time or times as the
Committee shall determine in its discretion. Each grant of Stock may be
evidenced by a certificate, notice or agreement setting forth the terms of such
Award.

Section 10.  Other Stock-Based Awards and Other Benefits.

         10.1. Other Stock-Based Awards. The Committee shall have the right to
         grant Other Stock-Based Awards which may include, without limitation,
         the grant of Shares based on certain conditions, the payment of cash
         based on the performance of the Common Stock, and the payment of Shares
         in lieu of cash under other Company incentive or bonus programs.
         Payment under or settlement of any such Awards shall be made in such
         manner and at such times as the Committee may determine.

         10.2. Other Benefits. The Committee shall have the right to provide
         types of Awards under the Plan in addition to those specifically listed
         utilizing shares of stock or cash, or a combination thereof, if the
         Committee believes that such Awards would further the purposes for
         which the Plan was established. Payment under or settlement of any such
         Awards shall be made in such manner and at such times as the Committee
         may determine.

         10.3. Substitution or Assumption of Awards. The Committee, from time to
         time, also may substitute or assume outstanding awards granted by
         another company, whether in connection with an acquisition of such
         other company or otherwise, by either (a) granting an Award under the
         Plan in substitution of such other company's award, or (b) assuming
         such award as if it had been granted under

                                       12
<PAGE>
         the Plan if the terms of such assumed award could be applied to an
         Award granted under the Plan. Such substitution or assumption shall be
         permissible if the holder of the substituted or assumed award would
         have been eligible to be granted an Award under the Plan if the other
         company had applied the rules of the Plan to such grant. In the event
         the Company assumes an award granted by another company, the terms and
         conditions of such award shall remain unchanged, except that the
         exercise price and the number and nature of Shares issuable upon
         exercise of any such option will be adjusted pursuant to Section 424(a)
         of the Code, notwithstanding other provisions of the Plan. In the event
         the Company elects to grant a new Award rather than assuming an
         existing option, such new Award may be granted with a similarly
         adjusted exercise price.

Section 11.  Amendment, Modification, and Termination of Plan.

Subject to the terms of the Plan, the Board at any time may terminate or suspend
the Plan, and from time to time may amend or modify the Plan, except that no
amendment or modification by the Board without shareholder approval shall
increase the number of Shares available for delivery under the Plan, decrease
the minimum per-share Option or SAR price or permit Employees to serve on the
Committee. No amendment, modification, or termination of the Plan shall in any
manner adversely affect any Award theretofore granted under the Plan to a
Participant without the consent of such Participant.

Section 12.  Termination of Employment.

         12.1. Termination of Employment Due to Retirement. Unless otherwise
         determined by the Committee at the time of grant, in the event a
         Participant's employment terminates by reason of retirement, any Option
         or SAR granted to such Participant which is then outstanding may be
         exercised at any time prior to the expiration of the term of the Option
         or SAR or within six (6) years following the Participant's termination
         of employment, whichever period is shorter, and any Restricted Stock,
         Phantom Stock rights, or other Award then outstanding for which any
         restriction has not lapsed prior to the effective date of retirement
         shall be forfeited.

         12.2. Termination of Employment Due to Death or Disability. Unless
         otherwise determined by the Committee at the time of grant, in the
         event a Participant's employment is terminated by reason of death or
         Disability, any Option or SAR granted to such Participant which is then
         outstanding may be exercised by the Participant, the Participant's
         designated beneficiary, the Participant's legal representative or other
         person entitled thereto, at any time prior to the expiration date of
         the term of the Option or SAR or within six (6) years following the
         Participant's termination of employment, whichever period is shorter,
         and any Restricted Stock, Phantom Stock rights, or other Award then
         outstanding shall become nonforfeitable and shall become transferable
         or payable, as the case may be, as though any restriction had expired.

                                       13
<PAGE>
         12.3. Termination of Employment for Any Other Reason. Unless otherwise
         determined by the Committee, whether at the time of grant or
         thereafter, in the event the employment of the Participant shall
         terminate for any reason other than misconduct or one described in
         Section 12.1 or 12.2, any Option or SAR granted to such Participant
         which is then outstanding may be exercised by the Participant at any
         time prior to the expiration date of the term of the Option or SAR or
         within three (3) months following the Participant's termination of
         employment, whichever period is shorter; any Restricted Stock, Phantom
         Stock rights, or other Award then outstanding for which any restriction
         has not lapsed prior to the date of termination of employment shall be
         forfeited upon termination of employment. If the employment of a
         Participant is terminated by the Company or a Subsidiary by reason of
         the Participant's misconduct, any outstanding Option or SAR shall
         terminate and cease to be exercisable on the date of the Participant's
         termination of employment; any Restricted Stock, Phantom Stock rights,
         or other Award then outstanding for which any restriction has not
         lapsed prior to the date of termination of employment shall be
         forfeited upon termination of employment. As used herein, "misconduct"
         means that the Participant has engaged, or intends to engage, in
         competition with the Company or a Subsidiary, has induced any customer
         of the Company or a Subsidiary to breach any contract with the Company
         or a Subsidiary, has made any unauthorized disclosure of any of the
         trade secrets or confidential information of the Company or a
         Subsidiary, has committed an act of embezzlement, fraud, or theft with
         respect to the property of the Company or a Subsidiary, or has
         deliberately disregarded the rules of the Company or a Subsidiary in
         such a manner as to cause any loss, damage, or injury to, or otherwise
         endanger the property, reputation, or employees of the Company or a
         Subsidiary. The Committee shall determine whether a Participant's
         employment is terminated by reason of misconduct.

         12.4. Accrual of Right at Date of Termination. The Participant shall
         have the right to exercise an Option or SAR as indicated in Section
         12.3 only to the extent the Participant's right to exercise such Option
         or SAR had accrued at the date of termination of employment pursuant to
         the terms of the Award and had not previously been exercised.

Section 13.  Change in Control.

Except as otherwise provided at the time of grant in the certificate, notice or
agreement relating to a particular Award, if a Change in Control occurs, then:

         (i) the Participant's Restricted Stock, Phantom Stock, or Other
         Stock-Based Awards that were forfeitable shall, unless otherwise
         determined by the Committee, become nonforfeitable and, to the extent
         applicable, shall be converted into Shares; and

                                       14
<PAGE>
         (ii) any unexercised Option or SAR, whether or not exercisable on the
         date of such Change in Control, shall thereupon be fully exercisable
         and may be exercised, in whole or in part.

Section 14.  Effect of Disposition of Facility or Operating Unit.

In the event that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries closes or disposes of
the facility at which a Participant is located or the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries diminish or eliminate ownership interests in any operating unit of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries so that such operating unit ceases to be
majority owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, then, with respect to
Awards held by Participants who subsequent to such event will not be employees
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, the Committee may (i) accelerate the
exercisability of Awards to the extent not yet otherwise exercisable or remove
any restrictions applicable to any Awards and (ii) extend the period during
which Awards will be exercisable to a date subsequent to the date when such
Awards would otherwise have expired by reason of the termination of such
Participant's employment with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (but in no
event to a date later than the expiration date of the Awards or the fifth
anniversary of the transaction in which such facility closes or operating unit
ceases). If the Committee takes no special action with respect to any
disposition of a facility or an operating unit, then any cessation of employment
resulting from such disposition will be treated as an ordinary cessation of
employment as described in Section 12.

Section 15.  Miscellaneous Provisions.

         15.1. Non-transferability of Awards. Unless otherwise determined by the
         Committee, whether at the time of grant or thereafter, and except as
         provided in Sections 12.2 and 15.2, no Award granted under the Plan
         shall be assignable, transferable, or payable to or exercisable by
         anyone other than the Participant to whom it was granted.

         15.2. Beneficiary Designation. Unless otherwise determined by the
         Committee, whether at the time of grant or thereafter, each Participant
         may from time to time name any beneficiary or beneficiaries (who may be
         named contingently or successively) to whom any benefit under the Plan
         is to be paid in the event of such Participant's death before he or she
         receives any or all of such benefit. Each such designation shall revoke
         all prior designations by such Participant, shall be in a form
         prescribed by the Company, and will be effective only when filed by the
         Participant in writing with the Company during the Participant's
         lifetime.

         15.3. No Guarantee of Employment or Participation. Nothing in the Plan
         shall interfere with or limit in any way the right of the Company or a
         Subsidiary to terminate any Participant's employment at any time, nor
         confer upon any Participant any right to continue in the employment of
         the Company or a

                                       15
<PAGE>
         Subsidiary. No Employee shall have a right to be selected as a
         Participant, or, having been so selected, to receive any future Awards.

         15.4. Tax Withholding. The Company shall have the authority to
         withhold, or require a Participant to remit to the Company an amount
         sufficient to satisfy federal, state, and local withholding tax
         requirements on any Award under the Plan, and the Company may defer
         payment of cash or issuance of Shares until such requirements are
         satisfied. Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, a Participant
         may elect, subject to such conditions as the Committee may require, to
         have Shares otherwise deliverable under the Plan withheld by the
         Company and having a Fair Market Value sufficient to satisfy all or
         part of such requirements or, if so determined by the Committee, the
         Participant's estimated total federal, state, and local tax obligation
         associated with the transaction.

         15.5. Governing Law. The Plan and all determinations made and actions
         taken pursuant hereto, to the extent not otherwise governed by the Code
         or Act, shall be governed by the law of the State of Illinois and
         construed in accordance therewith.

         15.6. Effectiveness of Plan. The Plan shall become effective upon its
         approval by the shareholders of the Company; provided, however, that no
         Award requiring the delivery of Shares shall be exercised or paid out
         unless at the time of such exercise or payout (i) such Shares are
         covered by a currently effective registration statement filed under the
         Securities Act of 1933, as amended, if one is then required, or in the
         sole opinion of the Company and its counsel such issuance of Shares is
         otherwise exempt from the registration requirements of such act, and
         (ii) such Shares are listed on any securities exchange upon which the
         Common Stock of the Company is listed.

         15.7. Unfunded Plan. Insofar as the Plan provides for Awards of cash,
         Shares, rights or a combination thereof, the Plan shall be unfunded.
         The Company may maintain bookkeeping accounts with respect to
         Participants who are entitled to Awards under the Plan, but such
         accounts shall be used merely for bookkeeping convenience. The Company
         shall not be required to segregate any assets that may at any time be
         represented by interests in Awards nor shall the Plan be construed as
         providing for any such segregation. None of the Committee, the Company
         or Board shall be deemed to be a trustee of any cash, Shares or rights
         to Awards granted under the Plan. Any liability of the Company to any
         Participant with respect to an Award or any rights thereunder shall be
         based solely upon any contractual obligations that may be created by
         the Plan and any Agreement, and no obligation of the Company under the
         Plan shall be deemed to be secured by any pledge or other encumbrance
         on any property of the Company.

         15.8. Deferrals. The Committee may permit a Participant to defer such
         Participant's receipt of the payment of cash or the delivery of Shares
         that would

                                       16
<PAGE>
         otherwise be due to such Participant by virtue of the exercise of an
         Option or SAR, the lapse or waiver of restrictions with respect to
         Restricted Stock or Phantom Stock, or the satisfaction of any
         requirements or goals with respect to Other Stock-Based Awards. If any
         such deferral election is permitted, the Committee shall, in its sole
         discretion, establish rules and procedures for such payment deferrals
         and the manner in which such deferral shall be accomplished.
