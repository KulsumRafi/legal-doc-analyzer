(&#147;Employee&#148;).</font></p> <p style=' margin-bottom:0pt;text-align:center; margin-top:16pt;'><u><font size=2>Statement of Purpose</font></u></p> <p style=' margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:0.36in; margin-top:8pt;'><font size=2>Employee is
presently employed by the Company as Vice President of Sales. Employee and the Company desire to provide for continued salary payments to Employee in the event Employee is terminated by the Company without cause, all subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement. </font></p> <p style=' margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:0.36in; margin-top:8pt;'><font size=2>Therefore, in consideration of the mutual covenants contained in this Agreement, and for other good and valuable consideration,

size=1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font><u><font size=2>Salary</font></u><font size=2>. The annual salary of Employee is $ 150,000 (the &#147;Initial Annual Salary&#148;) to be paid in accordance with the Company&#146;s payroll
practices as in existence from time to time. </font></p> <p style=' margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:0.36in; margin-top:6pt;'><font size=2>2.</font><font size=1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font><u><font size=2>Salary

business practices in connection with the Company&#146;s business, misappropriation of the Company&#146;s assets (determined on a reasonable basis), disability or material breach of any other provision of this Agreement. The determination of whether
&#147;Just Cause&#148; exists for termination shall be made by the Board of Directors of the Company in its sole discretion. For purposes of this section, the term &#147;disability&#148; means the inability of Employee, due to the condition of her
physical, mental or emotional health, to satisfactorily perform the duties of her employment hereunder for a continuous three month period; provided further that if the Company furnishes long term disability insurance for the Employee, the term
&#147;disability&#148; shall mean that continuous period sufficient to allow for the long term disability payments to commence pursuant to the Company&#146;s long term disability insurance policy. </font></p> <p style=' margin-bottom:0pt;

Company generally are eligible, or comparable plans or coverage, for a period of two years following termination of employment by the Employee, on the same terms as were in effect either (A) at the date of such termination, or (B) if such plans and
programs in effect prior to the Change of Control of Company are, considered together as a whole, materially more generous to the officers of Company, then at the date of the Change of Control. Any equity based incentive compensation (including but
not limited to stock options, SARs, etc.) shall fully vest and be immediately exercisable in full upon a Change in Control, not withstanding any provision in any applicable plan. Any such benefits shall be paid by the Company to the same extent as
