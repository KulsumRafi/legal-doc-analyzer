</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) <I>Prime Lease Terms and Conditions. </I>Other than the obligations for rent,
operating expenses, security deposit and other matters which are expressly
addressed in this Sublease as between Sublandlord and Subtenant, Subtenant
assumes and shall perform all obligations and comply with all covenants and
agreements of Sublandlord as &#147;Tenant&#148; under the Prime Lease with respect to the
Premises throughout the Sublease Term, and shall tender such performance
directly to Prime Landlord, so that the obligation of Sublandlord as Tenant
under the Prime Lease relating to the Premises during the Sublease Term shall
be fully satisfied and discharged by Subtenant. Subtenant agrees that each and
every covenant and agreement of the Prime Lease is agreed to be a term,
condition, covenant and agreement of this Sublease as applicable to the
Premises, and &#147;Landlord&#148; in the Prime Lease shall mean Sublandlord in this
Sublease and &#147;Tenant&#148; in the Prime Lease shall mean the Subtenant in this
Sublease, except where such construction would clearly be inapplicable, in
which event the original meaning shall apply. Subtenant shall have the right
to negotiate directly with Prime Landlord concerning leasing the Premises after
the expiration of the Sublease Term, however, Subtenant shall not request from
Prime Landlord, and shall not have any authority to approve or effect, any
change or modification to the Prime Lease except with the prior written consent
of Sublandlord.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) <I>Subtenant Rights. </I>Subtenant shall have all the rights, and privileges
of &#147;Tenant&#148; under the Prime Lease except as limited or modified by this
Sublease, and Subtenant may exercise the same without further consent or
approval of Sublandlord, except that Subtenant shall have no right to modify or
amend the Prime Lease, take any action inconsistent with the terms of this
Sublease or take any action or fail to take any action that would alone, or
with the passage of time, constitute a default under the Prime Lease or this
Sublease. Sublandlord shall have no obligation to provide any of the services,
or fulfill any of the obligations, of Prime Landlord under the Prime Lease and
if Prime Landlord fails to do so, Sublandlord&#146;s obligation with respect to such
failure to perform shall be limited to using reasonable efforts (which shall
not include the initiation or prosecution of litigation) to obtain performance
by Prime Landlord, provided, that the expenses incurred by Sublandlord in
connection therewith shall be reimbursed by Subtenant upon demand. In no
event shall Sublandlord have a duty to perform any obligations of Prime
Landlord that are, by their nature, the obligation of an owner or manager of
real property. For example, Sublandlord shall not be required to provide the
services or repairs that the Prime Landlord is required to provide under the
Prime Lease. Sublandlord shall have no responsibility for or be liable to
Subtenant for any default, failure

arising under the Prime Lease (through this Sublease) shall inure to the
benefit of both Sublandlord and Prime Landlord. In addition, Subtenant shall
obtain all insurance policies that are required to be obtained by the Tenant

</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) <I>Subtenant Obligations. </I>Subtenant shall submit to Sublandlord for
approval all plans and specifications for any construction, renovation or
alteration to be performed by Subtenant in the Premises prior to submission of
such plans and specifications to the Prime Landlord in accordance with the
Prime Lease, and shall not submit any such plans and specifications to the
Prime Landlord unless and until Sublandlord has approved the same in writing.
Subtenant shall perform all construction work in the Premises at its sole cost
and expense, and in conformance with the procedures set forth in the Prime
Lease.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2"><B>9) Sublandlord&#146;s Remedies</B>. Sublandlord&#146;s rights and remedies shall be subject
to the same notice and cure periods as are applicable under the Prime Lease,
except that, where necessary to prevent a default by Sublandlord under the
Prime Lease, Subtenant shall have no greater time period to cure a breach under
the Sublease than the last day available to cure a breach under the Prime
Lease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event Sublandlord determines in
its sole discretion that Subtenant will not or cannot cure a default under the
Prime Lease caused by Subtenant, Sublandlord may, but is not obligated to, cure
such default, after which, Subtenant shall reimburse and make whole Sublandlord
for all costs and expenses (including reasonable attorney&#146;s&#146; fees) incurred by
Sublandlord in connection therewith within five (5)&nbsp;business days after written
demand for reimbursement is made. In the event Subtenant shall be in default
hereunder (or under the Prime Lease by extension of this Sublease), Sublandlord
shall have all rights and remedies of the Prime Landlord under the Prime Lease
against Subtenant concerning remedies for default, in addition to all other
rights and remedies at law or in equity.

hereunder are expressly conditioned upon the Prime Landlord executing this
Sublease in the space provided on the signature page or in another form
reasonably acceptable to Sublandlord. Sublandlord and Subtenant hereby agree,
for the benefit of Prime Landlord, that this Sublease and Prime Landlord&#146;s
consent hereto shall not (a)&nbsp;create privity of contract between Prime Landlord
and Subtenant; (b)&nbsp;be deemed to have amended the Prime Lease in any regard
