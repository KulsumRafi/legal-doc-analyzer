hereunder, to the extent he desires such advice. *** also acknowledges that a
report of the payments herein may or may not be made by Daisytek or Daisytek's
representatives to the Internal Revenue Service depending upon applicable tax
laws. *** acknowledges that he must pay all of his own legal or tax advice fees,
taxes and COBRA continuation premiums out of the proceeds of the consideration
described in this Agreement.

         14. SEVERABILITY. If any provision of this Agreement is declared to be
illegal, invalid or unenforceable, such provision(s) will be severed from this
Agreement and this Agreement shall be construed as if such illegal, invalid or
unenforceable provision was never part of this Agreement. Any such illegal,
invalid or unenforceable provision will not affect the validity or the
enforceability of this Agreement or its remaining provisions.
