                           NON-COMPETITION AGREEMENT


This Non-Competition Agreement is made this 26th day of March 2003 by and
between Manhattan Associates ("Employer") and Neil Thall ("Employee").

WHEREAS, Employee and Employer mutually desire to terminate their employment
relationship;

WHEREAS, Employee has agreed to waive all rights to any severance payments
which were due to him under his employment agreement dated March 30, 1998.

NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the sufficiency of which
is hereby acknowledged, and in consideration of the mutual promises and
covenants set forth in this Agreement, the parties agree as follows:

1.       CONSIDERATION FOR SIGNING. In consideration for Employee signing this
         agreement, Employee shall receive $210,000.00 with proper withholdings
         for taxes, and paid in 12 equal semi-monthly installments of
         $17,500.00. Further, and in consideration of such payments, Employee
         agrees to provide reasonable telephonic consulting services to
         Employer to assist in matters, which may arise regarding transitioning
         Employee's duties to others. Further, Employee agrees to waive any
         severance payments or any other rights (but not any obligations due to
         Employer) due under his employment agreement dated March 30, 1998.

2.       NON-COMPETITION. Employee agrees that he will not work for any of the
         direct competitors to Employer listed in Schedule A for a period of
         Eighteen (18) months from the date of termination without written
         consent of Employer. Further, Employee agrees that he will not recruit
         or hire, another employee of Employer for a period of Eighteen (18)
         months from the date of termination or cause another employee of
         Employer to be hired by any competitor of Employer for a period of
         Eighteen (18) months from the date of termination.

3.       EFFECT OF VIOLATIONS BY EMPLOYEE. Employee agrees and understands that
         any action by him in violation of this NON-COMPETITION AGREEMENT shall
         void Employer's payment to the Employee of all severance monies and
         benefits provided for herein and shall require immediate repayment by
         the Employee of the value of all consideration paid to Employee by
         Employer pursuant to this Agreement, and shall further require
         Employee to pay all reasonable costs and attorneys' fees in defending
         any action Employee brings, plus any other damages to which the
         Employer may be entitled.

4.       SEVERABILITY. If any provision, or portion thereof, of this NON
         COMPETITION AGREEMENT is held invalid or unenforceable under
         applicable statute or rule of law, only that provision shall be deemed
         omitted from this Agreement, and only to the extent to which it is
         held invalid and the remainder of the Agreement shall remain in full
         force and effect.

5.       OPPORTUNITY FOR REVIEW. Employee understands that he shall have the
         right to have twenty-one (21) days from the date of receipt of this
         Agreement to review this document, and within seven (7) days of
         signing this NON COMPETITION AGREEMENT, to revoke this Agreement.
         Employer agrees and Employee understands that he does not waive any
         rights or claims that may arise after the date this Agreement is
         executed. THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THEY HAVE HAD ACCESS TO
         INDEPENDENT LEGAL COUNSEL OF THEIR OWN CHOOSING IN CONNECTION WITH
         ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, AND THE PARTIES HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT
         THEY FULLY UNDERSTAND THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT AND
         AGREE TO BE FULLY BOUND BY AND SUBJECT THERETO.
