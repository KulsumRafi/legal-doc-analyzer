Manufacturer for all costs and expenses relating to such audit within fifteen (15)

Manufacturer with corrected Resale Certificates. For the avoidance of doubt, such

for any reason, Manufacturer shall have the right to allocate or apportion available
Products among its customers as Manufacturer, in the exercise of its discretion, and upon

other Products upon one hundred eighty (180) days&#146; prior written notice to
Distributor. Manufacturer may materially alter the performance of any or all of the

manufacture or sale of any Analyzer, at Distributor&#146;s request Manufacturer will
negotiate with Distributor an appropriate length of time for the continued support of that
Analyzer beyond the date of discontinuing manufacture or sale, including continuation of
software support. For the &#147;200-series&#148; Analyzer, Manufacturer will continue
support for at least three (3) years from the date of discontinuing manufacture or sale.
