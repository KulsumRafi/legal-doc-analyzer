Incentive Plan (the &#147;Plan&#148;) (which previously was called The Corporate
Executive Board Company Non-Executive Stock Option Plan) is to advance the
interests of the Corporate Executive Board Company (the
&#147;Company&#148;) by stimulating the efforts of employees who are not
executive officers and service providers who are selected to be
participants, by heightening the desire of such persons to continue in
working toward and contributing to the success of the Company. The Plan
provides for grants of stock options and, effective upon the adoption of
this amended and restated document, restricted stock. Stock options granted
pursuant to this Plan are not incentive stock options, as defined in Section
422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#147;Code&#148;).</FONT></TD>

The Administrator may provide that the shares of Common Stock issued
upon exercise of an Option shall be subject to such further agreements,
restrictions, conditions or limitations as the Administrator in its
discretion may specify prior to the exercise of such Option, including
without limitation, conditions on vesting or transferability,
forfeiture or repurchase provisions and method of payment for the
shares issued upon exercise (including the actual or constructive
surrender of Common Stock already owned by the Participant). Without
limiting the foregoing, such restrictions may address the timing and
manner of any resales by the Participant or other subsequent transfers
by the Participant of any shares of Common Stock issued as a result of
the exercise of the Option, including without limitation (a)
restrictions under an insider trading policy, (b)&nbsp;restrictions designed
to delay and/or coordinate the timing and manner of sales by
Participant and other optionholders, and (c)&nbsp;restrictions as to the use
of a specified brokerage firm for such resales or other transfers. The
Administrator may establish rules for the deferred delivery of Common
Stock upon exercise of an Option with the deferral evidenced by use of
&#147;Stock Units&#148; equal in number to the number of shares of Common Stock
whose delivery is so deferred. A &#147;Stock Unit&#148; is a bookkeeping entry
representing an amount equivalent to the fair market value of one share
of Common Stock. Unless the Administrator specifies otherwise, Stock
Units represent an unfunded and unsecured obligation of the Company.
Settlement of Stock Units upon expiration of the deferral period shall
be made in Common Stock or otherwise as determined by the
Administrator. The amount of Common Stock, or other settlement medium,
to be so distributed may be increased by an interest factor or by
dividend equivalents. Until a Stock Unit is so settled, the number of
shares of Common Stock represented by a Stock Unit shall be subject to
adjustment pursuant to Section&nbsp;9. Any Stock Units that are settled
after the holder&#146;s death shall be distributed to the holder&#146;s
designated beneficiary(ies) or, if none was designated, the holder&#146;s
estate.</FONT></TD>
