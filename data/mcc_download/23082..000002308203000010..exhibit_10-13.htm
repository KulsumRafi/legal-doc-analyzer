<U><P ALIGN="CENTER">Purpose</P></DIR>
</DIR>

</U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan ("Supplemental Plan") is to provide retirement benefits to designated officers and key executives of Computer Sciences Corporation (the "Company") in addition to retirement benefits that may be payable under the Computer Sciences Corporation Employee Pension Plan, and in addition to any other retirement plan (other than the social security system to the extent provided herein) under which benefits may be payable with respect to such person.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is intended that this Supplemental Plan be a plan "for a select group of management or highly compensated employees" as set forth in Section 201(2) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject to Article&nbsp;X hereof, benefits under this Supplemental Plan shall be payable solely from the general assets of the Company and no Participant or other person shall be entitled to look to any source for payment of such benefits other than the general assets of the Company.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">ARTICLE ll</P>
<U><P ALIGN="CENTER">Effective Date/Restatement Date</P>
</U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Supplemental Plan was effective as of September 1, 1985. It is hereby amended and restated effective December 9, 2002.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">ARTICLE lll</P>
<U><P ALIGN="CENTER">Participants</P>
</U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No person shall be a Participant in this Supplemental Plan unless (a) such individual is specifically designated as such in a written instrument executed by the Chief Executive Officer of the Company (the "Chief Executive Officer"), and (b)&nbsp;such individual has consented to be governed by the terms of this Supplemental Plan by execution of a written instrument in form satisfactory to the Company.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A person shall cease to be a Participant in this Supplemental Plan in the event of (a) a Plan amendment having such effect, or (b) the occurrence of an event described in this Supplemental Plan which terminates such participation, or (c) prior to a Change in Control (as hereinafter defined), the Chief Executive Officer notifies such person, in writing, of the discontinuance of such person's participation pursuant to Article XVIII of this Supplemental Plan. In determining whether any person shall commence or cease to be a Participant herein, the Chief Executive Officer, acting in such capacity, shall have complete and unfettered discretion.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">ARTICLE IV</P>
<U><P ALIGN="CENTER">Retirement Benefits</P>
</U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amount of retirement benefit payable to each Participant upon Separation from Service (as defined in paragraph (d) below) shall be as determined in this Article IV, except as otherwise provided in Articles XIX, XX and XXI.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Participant who is entitled to receive a benefit under the Computer Sciences Corporation Employee Pension Plan ("Pension Plan"), shall be entitled to receive his Excess Benefit under this Supplemental Plan. The Excess Benefit is the additional monthly amount which the Participant would otherwise be entitled to receive under the Pension Plan as if the Participant had not elected to defer salary under the Company's Deferred Compensation Plan and had elected the normal form of life annuity payment option under the Pension Plan except for the limitations imposed by Sections 401(a)(17) and 415 of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, less any benefits provided for under Appendix M of the Pension Plan. In addition to the benefit described in this paragraph (a), a benefit as described in paragraph (b) following shall be payable to the Participant.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each Participant, upon Separation from Service on or after attainment of age sixty-two (62) (the "Retirement Date"), shall receive an amount as determined under this paragraph (b) which is payable monthly in the form of a life annuity. The amount payable shall be equal to one-twelfth (1/12) of fifty percent (50%) of the Participant's Average Base Salary Rate (as defined in paragraph (d) below) reduced by the amount determined under paragraph (c) below and, as applicable, paragraph (e) below.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amount determined under this paragraph (c) shall generally be equal to the primary social security benefit paid or payable to the Participant at the time benefits commence under this Supplemental Plan, whether or not the Participant is denied social security benefits because of other income or voluntarily forgoes social security income. However, where a Participant commences to receive benefits under this Supplemental Plan prior to attaining the minimum age (the "Minimum Social Security Age") at which he will be entitled to commence receiving social security benefits (currently age sixty-two (62)), his benefits under this Plan shall be reduced by the amount of social security benefits it is estimated he would be entitled to receive monthly. The estimated social security benefit will be calculated based on the Participant's compensation through his Separation from Service date as though he were the Minimum Social Security Age on such date, and in accordance with social security rules in effect at the time of his Separation from Service.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The term "Base Salary Rate" means the annual salary rate of a Participant exclusive of overtime, bonus, incentive or any other type of special compensation. The term "Average Base Salary Rate" means the average of the highest three (3) of the last five (5) Base Salary Rates of a Participant which are the Base Salary Rates in effect on his Retirement Date and on the same day and month for each of the four (4) years (or the period of Continuous Service if fewer than four (4) years) immediately preceding the Retirement Date. If the period of Continuous Service as of a Participant's Retirement Date is (i) less than two years but more than one year, "Average Base Salary Rate" means the average of the Base Salary Rate on his Retirement Date and on the same day and month of the immediately preceding year, or (ii) less than one year, "Average Base Salary Rate" means the Base Salary Rate on his Retirement Date.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless otherwise determined in writing with respect to a Participant by the Chief Executive Officer, the term "Continuous Service" means the period of service without interruption of a person commencing as of the date of hire of such person by the Company or an Affiliate and ending on the date of separation from service for any reason from the Company and all Affiliates ("Separation from Service"). The term "Affiliate" means a corporation or other entity of which fifty-one percent (51%) or more of the capital stock or capital or profits interest (in the case of a noncorporate entity) is directly or indirectly owned by the Company. A medical leave of absence not exceeding twelve (12) months authorized by a Company written policy or any other leave of absence authorized by a Company written policy or approved in writing by the Chief Executive Officer shall not be deemed an interruption in Continuous Service or a Separation from Service.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event the Company acquires a corporation or other entity ("Acquisition"), and any employee of the Acquisition, by written determination of the Chief Executive Officer of the Company, becomes a Participant in the Supplemental Plan, such Participant's period of Continuous Service shall commence no sooner than the date the Acquisition becomes an Affiliate of the Company unless the Company's Chief Executive Officer otherwise determines and so confirms in writing.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If upon Separation from Service on or after attaining age sixty-two (62), or upon the granting of a special early separation benefit pursuant to paragraph (b) of Article V, a Participant has fewer than twelve (12) years of Continuous Service, the benefit otherwise payable under this Supplemental Plan shall be proportionately reduced, except for the benefit payable under paragraph (a) of this Article IV which shall not be reduced. By way of example, if a Participant otherwise entitled to benefits hereunder commencing at age sixty-two (62) has completed only ten (10) years of Continuous Service upon attainment of age sixty-two (62), such Participant's benefit shall be 10/12, or 83.33%, of the benefit otherwise payable hereunder.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless expressly determined to the contrary in writing by the Chief Executive Officer, no period of service completed by a person after attainment of age sixty-five (65) and no adjustment to any person's Base Salary Rate which occurs after attainment of age sixty-five (65) shall be taken into account in computing benefits hereunder.</P>

</U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except as provided in Articles Vll and XIX, benefits payable based on the calculations in Article IV of this Supplemental Plan shall be paid monthly for the life-time of the Participant (unless an optional form is selected under paragraphs (b) or (c) of this Article Vl). Upon the death of the Participant, benefits shall continue to be paid to the Participant's spouse for the lifetime of such spouse at the rate of fifty percent (50%) of Participant's benefit (and to be calculated without regard to the offset in Section IV(a) regarding Appendix M of the Pension Plan), provided certain conditions are met. The conditions of such Spousal Benefit are (1) that the spouse shall be married to the Participant as of the date of the Participant's Separation from Service and (2) the spouse shall be no more than five years younger than the Participant. In the event the spouse is more than five years younger than the Participant, the Participant may elect to receive benefit payments in the form of a joint and survivor option as described in paragraph (c) following.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any Participant, who before September 1, 1993 has commenced to receive benefits and has not made a written election to receive an annuity pursuant to paragraph (a) preceding or paragraph (c) following, shall be entitled to one hundred twenty (120) monthly benefit payments in the amount specified in paragraph (b) of Article IV preceding and a life annuity of the Excess Benefit as defined in paragraph (a) of Article IV preceding. If a Participant, who before September 1, 1993, has commenced to receive benefits and has not made a written election to receive an annuity pursuant to paragraph (a) preceding or paragraph (c) following, dies after Separation from Service and before receiving one hundred and twenty (120) monthly benefit payments, the remainder of the one hundred and twenty (120) monthly benefit payments shall be made to the Participant's designated beneficiary or, if no such beneficiary is then living or no such beneficiary can be located, to the Participant's estate. In the event a Participant has made a written election, prior to September 1, 1993, to receive an annuity pursuant to paragraph (a) preceding or paragraph (c) following, no benefit shall be payable under this paragraph (b), except that any Excess Benefit under the Pension Plan, as provided in paragraph (a) of Article IV, shall be payable at the rate of fifty percent (50%) thereof to the Participant's spouse.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event that the Participant's spouse is more than five years younger than Participant, at any time prior to the later of September 1, 1993 or the commencement of benefits under this Supplemental Plan, a Participant may, in lieu of receiving benefits in the form described in paragraph (a) of this Article Vl, elect to receive benefit payments under this Supplemental Plan in the form of a joint and survivor option providing monthly benefits for the lifetime of the Participant with a stipulated percentage of such amount continued after the Participant's death to the spouse to whom the Participant is married as of the date of the Participant's Separation from Service, for the lifetime of such spouse. The amount of monthly payments available under this option shall be determined by reference to factors such as the Participant's life expectancy, the life expectancy of the Participant's spouse, prior benefits received under the Supplemental Plan, and the percentage of the Participant's monthly benefit which is continued after the Participant's death to the Participant's spouse, so that the value of the joint and survivor option is the actuarial equivalent of the benefits otherwise payable under paragraph (a) (or paragraph (b) if the Participant has elected coverage under paragraph (b) preceding) of this Article Vl inclusive of the Participant and the spousal fifty percent (50%) survivor benefits, which shall be calculated assuming the Participant's spouse was exactly five years younger than Participant. In determining the monthly amount payable under the joint and survivor option with respect to any Participant, the Company may rely upon such information as it, in its sole discretion, deems reliable, including but not limited to, the opinion of an enrolled actuary or annuity purchase rates quoted by an insurance company licensed to conduct an insurance business in the State of California. The election of a joint and survivor option is irrevocable after benefit payments have commenced, and the monthly amount payable during the lifetime of the Participant shall in no event be adjusted by reason of the death of the Participant's spouse prior to the death of the Participant, or by reason of the dissolution of the marriage between the Participant and such spouse, or for any other reason.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(h)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;conduct by the Company, against the Participant's volition, that would cause the Participant to commit fraudulent acts or would expose the Participant to criminal liability;</P>
<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">provided</U> that for purposes of clauses (b) through (e) above, "Good Reason" shall not exist (A) if the aggregate value of all salary, benefits, incentive compensation arrangements, perquisites and other compensation is reasonably equivalent to the aggregate value of salary, benefits, incentive compensation arrangements, perquisites and other compensation as in effect immediately prior to the Change in Control, or as in effect thereafter if the aggregate value of such items has been increased and such increase was approved prior to the Change in Control, or (B) if the reduction in aggregate value is due to reduced performance by the Company, the business unit of the Company for which the Participant is responsible, or the Participant, in each case applying standards reasonably equivalent to those utilized by the Company prior to the Change in Control.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not later than the occurrence of a Change in Control, the Company shall cause to be transferred to a grantor trust described in Section&nbsp;671 of the Internal Revenue Code, assets equal in value to all accrued obligations under this Supplemental Plan as of one day following a Change in Control, in respect of both active employees of the Company and retirees as of that date. Such trust by its terms shall, among other things, be irrevocable.
