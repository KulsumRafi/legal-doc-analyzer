         The parties desire to amend the Loan Agreement as hereinafter set

         NOW, THEREFORE, for TEN DOLLARS ($10.00) in hand paid and other good

severally acknowledged, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound
hereby, agree as follows:

         1.       DEFINITIONS. All capitalized terms used in this Amendment,

Agreement and by substituting in lieu thereof the following:

                           "AVERAGE MONTHLY LOAN BALANCE" shall mean the amount
                  obtained by adding the unpaid balance of Revolver Loans and
                  Letter of Credit Obligations owing by Borrower to Lender at
                  the end of each day for each day during the month in question
                  and by dividing such sum by the number of days in such month.



<PAGE>

                           "MINIMUM LOAN BALANCE" shall mean $2,500,000.

                           "REVOLVER NOTE" shall mean that certain Amended and

                  Borrower to Lender in the original principal amount of up to
                  $10,000,000.

                  (c)      By deleting Section 2(a) of the Loan Agreement and by
substituting in lieu thereof the following:

                           A.       REVOLVING LOANS.

                           Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement
                  and the Other Agreements, during the Original Term and any
                  Renewal Term, Lender agrees to make revolving loans and
                  advances (the "Revolving Loans") in an amount up to the sum of
                  the following sublimits (the "Revolving Loan Limit"):

                                    (i)      Up to eighty-five percent (85%) of
                  the face amount (less maximum discounts, credits and
                  allowances which may be taken by or granted to Account Debtors
                  in connection therewith in the ordinary course of Borrower's
                  business) of Borrower's Eligible Accounts; minus

                                    (ii)     such reserves as Lender elects, in
                  its sole discretion to establish from time to time;

                  provided, that THE REVOLVING LOAN LIMIT SHALL IN NO EVENT
                  EXCEED TEN MILLION AND NO/100 DOLLARS ($10,000,000) (THE
                  "MAXIMUM REVOLVING LOAN LIMIT").

                           The aggregate unpaid principal balance of the
                  Revolving Loans shall not at any time exceed the lesser of:
                  (i) the Revolving Loan Limit minus the Letter of Credit
                  Obligations and (ii) the Maximum Revolving Loan Limit minus
                  the Letter of Credit Obligations. If at any time the
                  outstanding Revolving Loans exceeds either the Revolving Loan
                  Limit or the Maximum Revolving Loan Limit, in each case minus
                  the Letter of Credit Obligations, or any portion of the
                  Revolving Loans and Letter of Credit Obligations exceeds any
                  applicable sublimits under subsections (i) and (ii) above
                  within the Revolving Loan Limit, Borrower shall immediately,
                  and without the necessity of demand


                                      -2-
<PAGE>

                  by Lender, pay to Lender such amount as may be necessary to
                  eliminate such excess and Lender shall apply such payment to
                  the Revolving Loans in such order as Lender shall determine in
                  its sole discretion.

                           Borrower hereby authorizes Lender, (but without any
                  obligation or duty of Lender to do so) to charge any of
                  Borrower's accounts or advance Revolving Loans to make any
                  payments of principal, interest, fees, costs or expenses
                  required to be made under this Agreement or the Other
                  Agreements.

                           A request for a Revolving Loan shall be made or shall
                  be deemed to be made, each in the following manner: Borrower
                  shall give Lender same day notice, no later than 10:30 A.M.
                  (Chicago time) for such day, of its request for a Revolving
                  Loan. In the event that Borrower maintains a controlled
                  disbursement account at LaSalle Bank, each check presented for
                  payment against such controlled disbursement account and any
                  other charge or request for payment against such controlled
                  disbursement account shall constitute a request for a
                  Revolving Loan. As an accommodation to Borrower, Lender may
                  permit telephone requests for Revolving Loans and electronic
                  transmittal of instructions, authorizations, agreements or
                  reports to Lender by Borrower. Unless Borrower specifically
                  directs Lender in writing not to accept or act upon telephonic
                  or electronic communications from Borrower, Lender shall have
                  no liability to Borrower for any loss or damage suffered by
                  Borrower as a result of Lender's honoring of any requests,
                  execution of any instructions, authorizations or agreements or
                  reliance on any reports communicated to it telephonically or
                  electronically and purporting to have been sent to Lender by
                  Borrower and Lender shall have no duty to verify the origin of
                  any such communication or the authority of the Person sending
                  it.

                           Borrower hereby irrevocably authorizes Lender to
                  disburse the proceeds of each Revolving Loan requested by
                  Borrower, or deemed to be requested by Borrower, as follows:
                  (i) the proceeds of each Revolving Loan requested under
                  Section 2(a) shall be disbursed by Lender in lawful money of
                  the United States of America in immediately available funds,
                  in the case of the initial borrowing, in accordance with the
                  terms of the written disbursement letter from Borrower, and
                  (ii) in the case of each subsequent borrowing, by wire
                  transfer or Automated Clearing House (ACH) transfer to such
                  bank account as may be agreed upon


                                      -3-
<PAGE>

                  by Borrower and Lender from time to time, or elsewhere if
                  pursuant to a written direction from Borrower.

                  (d)      By deleting Section 4(b)(ii) of the Loan Agreement
and by substituting in lieu thereof the following:

                           (ii)     Unused Line Fee: Borrower shall pay to
                  Lender an unused line fee of three quarters of one percent
                  (0.75%) of the difference between the Maximum Revolving Loan
                  Limit and the greater of (x) Average Monthly Loan Balance and
                  (y) the Minimum Loan Balance, which fee shall be fully earned
                  by Lender and payable monthly in arrears on the first Business
                  Day of each month. Said fee shall be calculated on the basis
                  of a 360 day year.

                  (e)      By adding a new Section 4(b)(v) to the Loan Agreement
that reads as follows:

                           (v)      Annual Facility Fee. Borrower shall pay to
                  Lender an annual facility fee of $100,000, payable on the
                  first day of each calendar year, in advance, commencing on
                  January 1, 2003.

                  (f)      By deleting Section 4(d) of the Loan Agreement and by
substituting the following in lieu thereof:

                           Regardless of any provision contained in any of the
                  Other Agreements, in no contingency or event whatsoever shall
                  the aggregate of all amounts that are contracted for, charged
                  or received by Lender pursuant to the terms of this Agreement
                  or any of the Other Agreements and that are deemed interest
                  under applicable law exceed the highest rate permissible under
                  any applicable law. No agreements, conditions, provisions or
                  stipulations contained in this Agreement or any of the Other
                  Agreements or the exercise by Lender of the right to
                  accelerate the payment or the maturity of all or any portion
                  of the Obligations, or the exercise of any option whatsoever
                  contained in the Loan Agreement or any of the Other Documents,
                  or the prepayment by Borrower of any of the Obligations, or
                  the occurrence of any contingency whatsoever, shall entitle
                  Lender to charge or receive in any event, interest in excess
                  of the maximum rate permitted by applicable law (the "Maximum
                  Rate") and in no event shall Borrower be obligated to pay any
                  charges, amounts, premiums or fees deemed interest by
                  applicable law (such interest, charges, amounts, premiums and
                  fees referred to herein collectively as "Interest") exceeding
                  such Maximum Rate, and all agreements, conditions or
                  stipulations, if any, which may in any


                                      -4-
<PAGE>

                  event or contingency whatsoever operate to bind, obligate or
                  compel Borrower to pay Interest exceeding the Maximum Rate
                  shall be without binding force or effect, at law or in equity,
                  to the extent only of the excess of Interest over such Maximum
                  Rate. If any Interest is charged or received in excess of the
                  Maximum Rate permitted by applicable law ("Excess"), Borrower
                  acknowledges and stipulates that any such charge or receipt
                  shall be the result of an accident and bona fide error, and
                  such Excess, to the extent received, shall be applied first to
                  reduce the principal Liabilities and the balance, if any,
                  returned to Borrower, it being the intent of the parties
                  hereto not to enter into a usurious or otherwise illegal
                  relationship. All monies paid to Lender hereunder or under any
                  of the Other Agreements, whether at maturity or by prepayment,
                  shall be subject to any rebate of unearned Interest as and to
                  the extent required by applicable law. By the execution of
                  this Agreement, Borrower covenants that (i) the credit or
                  return of any Excess shall constitute the acceptance by
                  Borrower of such Excess, and (ii) Borrower shall not seek or
                  pursue any other remedy, legal or equitable, against Lender,
                  based in whole or in part upon contracting for, charging or
                  receiving any Interest in excess of the Maximum Rate. For the
                  purpose of determining whether or not any Excess has been
                  contracted for, charged or received by Lender, all Interest at
                  any time contracted for, charged or received from Borrower in
                  connection with the Loan Agreement or any of the Other
                  Agreements shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law,
                  be amortized, prorated, allocated and spread in equal parts
                  throughout the full term of the Liabilities. Borrower and
                  Lender shall, to the maximum extent permitted under applicable
                  law, (i) characterize any non-principal payment as an expense,
                  fee or premium rather than as Interest and (ii) exclude
                  voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof. The provisions
                  of this Section shall be deemed to be incorporated into every
                  Other Agreement (whether or not any provision of this Section
                  is referred to therein). All such Other Agreements and
                  communications relating to any Interest owed by Borrower and
                  all figures set forth therein shall, for the sole purpose of
                  computing the extent of Liabilities, be automatically
                  recomputed by Borrower, and by any court considering the same,
                  to give effect to the adjustments or credits required by this
                  Section.

                  (g)      By deleting Section 10 of the Loan Agreement and by
substituting in lieu thereof the following:


                                      -5-

                  10.      TERMINATION; AUTOMATIC RENEWAL.

                           THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE IN EFFECT FROM THE DATE
                  HEREOF UNTIL MARCH 17, 2005 (THE "ORIGINAL TERM") AND SHALL
                  AUTOMATICALLY RENEW ITSELF FROM YEAR TO YEAR THEREAFTER (EACH
                  SUCH ONE-YEAR RENEWAL BEING REFERRED TO HEREIN AS A "RENEWAL
                  TERM") UNLESS (A) LENDER MAKES DEMAND FOR REPAYMENT PRIOR TO
                  THE END OF THE ORIGINAL TERM OR THE THEN CURRENT RENEWAL TERM;
                  (B) THE DUE DATE OF THE LIABILITIES IS ACCELERATED PURSUANT TO
                  SECTION 16 HEREOF; (C) BORROWER ELECTS TO TERMINATE THIS
                  AGREEMENT AT THE END OF THE ORIGINAL TERM OR AT THE END OF ANY
                  RENEWAL TERM BY GIVING LENDER WRITTEN NOTICE OF SUCH ELECTION
                  AT LEAST NINETY (90) DAYS PRIOR TO THE END OF THE ORIGINAL
                  TERM OR THE THEN CURRENT RENEWAL TERM AND BY PAYING ALL OF THE
                  LIABILITIES IN FULL ON THE LAST DAY OF SUCH TERM; OR (D)
                  LENDER ELECTS TO TERMINATE THIS AGREEMENT ON OR AFTER FEBRUARY
                  1, 2004, AS A RESULT OF A TERMINATION EVENT. If one or more of
                  the events specified in clauses (a), (b) and (c) occurs, then
                  (i) Lender shall not make any additional Loans on or after the
                  date identified as the date on which the Liabilities are to be
                  repaid; and (ii) this Agreement shall terminate on the date
                  thereafter that the Liabilities are paid in full. At such time
                  as Borrower has repaid all of the Liabilities and this
                  Agreement has terminated, Borrower shall deliver to Lender a
                  release, in form and substance satisfactory to Lender, of all
                  obligations and liabilities of Lender and its officers,
                  directors, employees, agents, parents, subsidiaries and
                  affiliates to Borrower, and if Borrower is obtaining new
                  financing from another lender, Borrower shall deliver such
                  lender's indemnification of Lender, in form and substance
                  satisfactory to Lender, for checks which Lender has credited
                  to Borrower's account, but which subsequently are dishonored
                  for any reason or for automatic clearinghouse or wire
                  transfers not yet posted to Borrower's account.

                  (h)      By deleting Section 11(d) of the Loan Agreement and
by substituting in lieu thereof the following:


                                      -6-
<PAGE>


                           D.       ACCOUNTS.

                                    Each Account which Borrower shall, expressly
                  or by implication, request Lender to classify as an Eligible
                  Account shall, as of the time when such request is made,
                  conform in all respects to the requirements of such
                  classification as set forth in the definition of "Eligible
                  Account"as set forth herein and as otherwise established by
                  Lender from time to time.

                  (i)      By deleting Section 12(b)(ii) of the Loan Agreement
and by substituting in lieu thereof the following:

                           (ii)     Eligible Accounts. Promptly upon becoming
                  aware thereof, notify Lender if any Account identified by
                  Borrower or any Subsidiary to Lender as an Eligible Account
                  becomes ineligible for any reason.

                  (j)      By deleting Exhibit A, Schedule 11(n) and Schedule 14
to the Loan Agreement in their entirety and by substituting in lieu thereof,
respectively, Exhibit A, Schedule 11(n) and Schedule 14 attached hereto.

                  (k)      By adding to Schedule 11(g) to the Loan Agreement the
information contained on Schedule 11(g) attached hereto.

                  (l)      Any and all references in the Loan Agreement and
Other Agreements to "Stepic Corporation" or "Stepic" shall mean HMP
Distribution, Inc., a New York corporation.

         3.       ELIMINATION OF PREPAYMENT FEE; RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL.
Borrower has requested that Lender eliminate the prepayment fee payable pursuant
to Section 10 of the Loan Agreement. To induce Lender to do so, if Borrower
seeks the refinancing of the Liabilities, Borrower agrees that Lender shall have
a right of first refusal to submit a proposal with regards to any such

                   FORM OF AMENDED AND RESTATED REVOLVING NOTE


Executed as of December ___, 2002                                No.___________
Amount $10,000,000.00

                  FOR VALUE RECEIVED, the Undersigned (jointly and severally, if
more than one) promises to pay to the order of STANDARD FEDERAL BANK NATIONAL
ASSOCIATION, acting by and through LASALLE BUSINESS CREDIT, INC., as its agent
(hereinafter, together with any holder hereof, called "Lender"), at the main
office of the lender, the principal sum of Ten Million and No/100 Dollars
($10,000,000) plus the aggregate unpaid principal amount of all advances made by
Lender to the Undersigned (or any one of them, if more than one) pursuant to and
in accordance with Subsection 2(a) of the Loan Agreement (as hereinafter
defined) in excess of such amount, or, if less, the aggregate unpaid principal
amount of all advances made by Lender to the Undersigned (or any one of them, if
more than one) pursuant to and in accordance with Subsection 2(a) of the Loan
Agreement. The Undersigned (jointly and severally, if more than one) further
promises to pay interest on the outstanding principal amount hereof on the dates
and at the rates provided in the Loan Agreement from the date hereof until
payment in full hereof. The Prime Rate on the date hereof is __________________
percent (_____%) per annum and therefore, the rate of interest in effect
hereunder on the date hereof, expressed in simple interest terms, is
_________________ percent (_____%) per annum.


                  This Note is referred to in and is delivered pursuant to that
certain Loan and Security Agreement, as it may be amended from time to time,
together with all exhibits thereto, dated as of March 18, 2002, between Lender
and the Undersigned (the "Loan Agreement"). All terms which are capitalized and
used herein (which are not otherwise defined herein) shall have the meaning
ascribed to such term in the Loan Agreement.


                  Principal hereunder shall be payable pursuant to the terms of
the Loan Agreement.

                  The Undersigned (and each one of them, if more than one)
hereby authorizes the Lender to charge any account of the Undersigned (and each
one of them, if more than one) for all sums due hereunder. If payment hereunder
becomes due and payable on a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday under the laws of
the United States or the States of Illinois or Georgia, the due date thereof
shall be extended to the next succeeding business day, and interest shall be
payable thereon at the rate specified during such extension. Credit shall be
given for payments made in the manner and at the times provided in the Loan
Agreement. It is the intent of the parties that the rate of interest and other
charges to the Undersigned under this Note shall be lawful; therefore, if for
any reason the interest or other charges payable hereunder are found by a court
of competent jurisdiction, in a final determination, to exceed the limit which
Lender may lawfully charge the Undersigned, then the obligation to pay interest
or other charges shall


                                      -11-
<PAGE>

automatically be reduced to such limit and, if any amount in excess of such
limit shall have been paid, then such amount shall be refunded to the
Undersigned.

                  The principal and all accrued interest hereunder may be
prepaid by the Undersigned, in part or in full, at any time; provided, however,
that the Undersigned shall pay a prepayment fee as provided in the Loan
Agreement.

                  The Undersigned (and each one of them, if more than one)
waives the benefit of any law that would otherwise restrict or limit Lender in
the exercise of its right, which is hereby acknowledged, to set-off against the
Liabilities, without notice and at any time hereafter upon the occurrence and
during the continuation of an Event of Default, any indebtedness matured or
unmatured owing from Lender to the Undersigned (or any one of them). The
Undersigned (and each one of them, if more than one) waives every defense,
counterclaim or setoff which the Undersigned (or any one of them) may now have
or hereafter may have to any action by Lender in enforcing this Note and/or any
of the other Liabilities, or in enforcing Lender's rights in the Collateral and
ratifies and confirms whatever Lender may do pursuant to the terms hereof and of
the Loan Agreement and with respect to the Collateral and agrees that Lender
shall not be liable for any error in judgment or mistakes of fact or law.

                  The Undersigned, any other party liable with respect to the
Liabilities and any and all endorsers and accommodation parties, and each one of
them, if more than one, waive any and all presentment, demand, notice of
dishonor, protest, and all other notices and demands in connection with the
enforcement of Lender's rights hereunder.

                  The loan evidenced hereby has been made and this Note has been
delivered at Atlanta, Georgia. THIS NOTE SHALL BE GOVERNED AND CONTROLLED BY THE
INTERNAL LAWS OF THE STATE OF GEORGIA AS TO INTERPRETATION, ENFORCEMENT,
VALIDITY, CONSTRUCTION, EFFECT, AND IN ALL OTHER RESPECTS, INCLUDING WITHOUT
LIMITATION, THE LEGALITY OF THE INTEREST RATE AND OTHER CHARGES, and shall be
binding upon the Undersigned (and each one of them, if more than one) and the
Undersigned's legal representatives, successors and assigns (and each of them,
if more than one). If this Note contains any blanks when executed by the
Undersigned (or any one of them, if more than one), the Lender is hereby
authorized, without notice to the Undersigned (or any one of them, if more than
one) to complete any such blanks according to the terms upon which the loan or
loans were granted. Wherever possible, each provision of this Note shall be
interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law,
but if any provision of this Note shall be prohibited by or be invalid under
such law, such provision shall be severable, and be ineffective to the extent of
such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remaining provisions of
this Note. If more than one party shall execute this Note, the term
"Undersigned" as used herein shall mean all parties signing this Note, and each
one of them, and all such parties, their respective heirs, executors,
administrators, successors and assigns, shall be jointly and severally obligated
hereunder.

                  To induce the Lender to make the loan evidenced by this Note,
the Undersigned (and each one of them, if more than one) (i) irrevocably agrees
that, subject to Lender's sole and absolute election, all actions arising
directly or indirectly as a result or in consequence of this Note or any other
agreement with the Lender, or the Collateral, shall be instituted and litigated
only in courts having situs in Cobb County, Georgia; (ii) hereby consents to the
exclusive jurisdiction and venue of any State or Federal Court located and
having its situs in said city; and (iii) waives any objection based on forum
non-conveniens. IN ADDITION, LENDER AND THE UNDERSIGNED (OR ANY ONE OF THEM, IF
MORE THAN ONE) HEREBY WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING WHICH
PERTAINS DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY TO THIS NOTE, THE LIABILITIES, THE COLLATERAL,
ANY ALLEGED TORTIOUS CONDUCT BY THE UNDERSIGNED OR LENDER OR WHICH IN ANY WAY,
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, ARISES OUT OF OR RELATES TO THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE
UNDERSIGNED AND LENDER. In addition, the Undersigned agrees that all service of
process shall be made as provided in the Loan Agreement. This Note is intended
to take effect as an instrument under seal under Georgia law.


                  As used herein, all provisions shall include the masculine,
feminine, neuter, singular and plural thereof, wherever the context and facts
require such construction and in particular the word "Undersigned" shall be so
construed.


                  This Note amends, restates, renews, replaces and supersedes
that certain Revolving Note dated as of March 18, 2002 (the "Original Revolving
Note"). It is the intention of the Undersigned and Lender that while this Note
amends, restates, renews, replaces and supersedes the Original Revolving Note,
it is not in payment or satisfaction of the Original Revolving Note, but rather
constitutes the substitution of one evidence of debt for another without any
intent to extinguish the old. Should there be any conflict between any of the
terms of the Original Revolving Note and the terms of this Note, the terms of
this Note shall control.


                  IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Undersigned has caused this Note to be
executed under seal and delivered by its duly authorized officer on the date
first written above.
