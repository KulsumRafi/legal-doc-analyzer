          concerning the Accounts are 870 Remington Drive, Madison, North

          or on behalf of Factors in connection with the execution, delivery and
          performance of this Agreement that has not been obtained. Each Patent
          License, Trademark License and Account constituting Collateral is in
          full force and effect and constitutes a valid and legally enforceable
          obligation of Factors and (to the knowledge of Factors) each other
          party thereto except as enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy,
          insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting the
          enforcement of creditor's rights generally and by general equitable
          principles (whether enforcement is sought by proceedings in equity or

          Effect on the value of the Collateral. Except as set forth in

          validity or enforceability of any of the Patent Licenses ,Trademark
          Licenses and Accounts constituting Collateral by any party thereto
          other than those which have been duly obtained, made or performed and
          are in full force and effect and those the failure of which to make or
          obtain could not be reasonably expected, in the aggregate, to have a
          Material Adverse Effect on the value of the Collateral. Except as set
          forth in Schedules I and II hereto, neither Factors nor (to the
          knowledge of Factors) any other party to any Patent License or
          Trademark License or Account constituting Collateral is in default in
          the performance or observance of any of the terms thereof, except for
          such defaults as could not reasonably be expected, in the aggregate,
          to have a Material Adverse Effect on the value of the Collateral. The
          right, title and interest of Factors in, to and under each Patent
          License and Trademark License and each Account constituting Collateral
          are not subject to any defense, offset, counterclaim or claim which
          could be reasonably expected, either individually or in the aggregate,
          to have a Material Adverse Effect on the value of the Collateral.

          Equipment are kept at the locations listed in Schedule III hereto or

                 (j)      Copyrights. As of the date hereof, Factors does not

          Ordinary Course of Business) which are material to the business of
          Factors and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Factors agrees that
          the foregoing representations and warranties shall be deemed to have
          been made by Factors on and as of each date on which a Revolver Loan
          is made by the Lenders to the Borrowers under the Credit Agreement, in
          each case as though made on and as of each such date (or, if any such
          representation or warranty is expressly stated to have been made as of
          a specific date, as of such specific date).

          5.     Covenants. Factors covenants and agrees with the Agent and the

          financing or continuation statement without the signature of Factors
          to the extent permitted by Applicable Law. The Agent agrees to notify
          Factors and Factors agrees to notify the Agent of any financing or
          continuation statement filed by it pursuant to this Section 5(a),
          provided that any failure to give any such notice shall not affect the
          validity or effectiveness of any such filing. Unless an Event of
          Default shall have occurred and be continuing, Factors shall be
          entitled to retain possession of all Collateral evidenced by any
          Instrument or Chattel Paper, and shall hold all such Collateral in
          trust for the Agent, and shall not commingle any of such Collateral
          with any other assets of Factors. In the event an Event of Default
          shall have occurred and be continuing, upon the request of the Agent,
          such Collateral shall be immediately delivered to the Agent, duly
          endorsed in a manner satisfactory to the Agent, to be held as
          Collateral pursuant to this Agreement. Factors shall not permit any
          other Person to possess any such Collateral other than in connection
          with any sale or other disposition of such Collateral as permitted by
          the Credit Agreement, or as otherwise consented to by Agent in
          writing.

          harmless and defend the Agent and the Lenders from, any and all
          liabilities and reasonable costs and expenses (including, reasonable

          delay by Factors in paying, any and all excise, sales or other similar
          taxes which may be payable or determined to be payable with respect to
          any of the Collateral, (ii) with respect to, or resulting from, any
          delay by Factors in complying with any material requirement of
          Applicable Law with respect to any of the Collateral or (iii) in
          connection with any of the transactions contemplated by this
          Agreement, provided that such indemnity shall not, as to the Agent or
          any Lender, be available to the extent that such liabilities, costs
          and expenses resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct
          of the Agent or any Lender. In any suit, proceeding or action brought
          by the Agent or any Lender under any Account for any sum owing
          thereunder, or to enforce any provisions of any Account, Factors will
          save, indemnify and keep harmless and defend the Agent and such Lender
          from and against all expense, loss or damage suffered by reason of any
          defense, setoff, counterclaim, recoupment or reduction or liability
          whatsoever of the account debtor thereunder, arising out of a material
          breach by Factors of any obligation thereunder.

          at its own cost and expense reasonably satisfactory and complete
          records of the Collateral, including a record of all payments received
          and all credits granted with respect to the Accounts constituting
          Collateral. For the Agent's and the Lenders' further security, the
          Agent, shall have a security interest in all of Factors's books and
          records pertaining to the Collateral, and Factors shall permit the
          Agent or its representatives to review such books and records upon
          reasonable advance notice during normal business hours at the location
          where such books and records are kept and at the reasonable request of
          the Agent.

          Default, the Agent and the Lenders shall have reasonable access during
          normal business hours to all the books, correspondence and records of
          Factors, and the Agent and the Lenders and their respective

          and their respective representatives shall also have the right upon
          reasonable advance notice to Factors to enter during normal business
          hours into and upon any premises where any of Factors's Inventory or
          Equipment is located for the purpose of inspecting the same, observing
          its use or otherwise protecting its interests therein.

                 (e)      Compliance with Laws, etc. Factors will comply in all
          material respects with all Applicable Law with respect to the
          Collateral or any part thereof, except to the extent that the failure
          to so comply could not be reasonably expected to have a Material
          Adverse Effect, in the aggregate, on the Agent's or the Lenders'
          rights hereunder, the priority of their Liens on the Collateral or the
          value of the Collateral.

                 (f)      Compliance with Contractual Obligations. Factors will
          perform and comply in all material respects with all its contractual

          compliance is fully excused by breach by the other party or parties
          thereto or (ii) such failure to comply or perform could not be
          reasonably expected, in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse
          Effect on the value of the Collateral.

                 (g)      Payment of Obligations. Factors will pay promptly when
          due all taxes, assessments and governmental charges or levies imposed
          upon the Collateral, as well as all claims of any kind (including
          claims for labor, materials and supplies) against or with respect to
          the Collateral, except that no such tax, assessment, charge or levy
          need be paid if (i) the validity thereof is being contested in good
          faith by appropriate proceedings diligently conducted and (ii) such
          tax, assessment, charge or levy is adequately reserved against on
          Factors's books in accordance with GAAP.

                 (h)      Limitation on Liens on Collateral. Factors will not
          create, incur or permit to exist, will defend the Collateral against,
          and will take such other action as is reasonably necessary to remove,
          any Lien or material adverse claim on or to any of the Collateral,
          other than the Liens created hereby and other than Permitted Liens,
          and will defend the right, title and interest of the Agent and the
          Lenders in and to any of the Collateral against the claims and demands
          of all Persons whomsoever.

                 (i)      Limitations on Dispositions of Collateral. Without the
          prior written consent of the Agent, Factors will not sell, assign,

          Contracts, Licenses and Accounts. Factors will not, except in the
          Ordinary Course of Business, amend, modify, terminate or waive any
          provision of any material Trademark License or any agreement giving
          rise to a material Account constituting Collateral in any manner which
          could reasonably be expected to materially adversely affect the value
          of such Trademark License or Account as Collateral.

                 (k)      Limitations on Discounts, Compromises, Extensions of
          Accounts. At all times, Factors will not, except in the Ordinary

          repairs necessary for such purpose, except to the extent that the
          failure to do any of the foregoing could not be reasonably expected to

          Agreement or (iii) change its name, identity or corporate structure to

          the future acquire any right, title or interest in or to any Copyright
          or Copyright License which is material to the business of Factors and
          its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, other than (i) with respect to
          Computer Hardware and Software licenses or other Copyright licenses
          granted to Factors in the Ordinary Course of Business, (ii) in
          connection with any rights of Factors in respect of security interests
          in collateral or (iii) with respect to which (A) the Agent shall have
          been given prior written notice of the acquisition of any right, title
          or interest therein or thereto and (B) if reasonably requested by the
          Agent, a security agreement reasonably satisfactory to the Agent shall
          have been executed by Factors.

                 (r)      Commercial Tort Claims. If Factors shall at any time
          hold or acquire a Commercial Tort Claim, Factors shall promptly notify
          Agent in a writing signed by Factors of the brief details thereof and
          grant to Agent in such writing a security interest therein and in the
          proceeds thereof, all upon the terms of this Agreement, with such
          writing to be in form and substance satisfactory to Agent.

          6.     Agent's Appointment as Attorney-in-Fact.

                 (a)      Powers. Factors hereby irrevocably constitutes and
          appoints the Agent and any officer or agent thereof, with full power
          of substitution, as its true and lawful attorney-in-fact with full
          irrevocable power and authority in the place and stead of Factors and
          in the name of Factors or in its own name, from time to time in the
          Agent's discretion, for the purpose of carrying out the terms of this
          Agreement, to take any and all appropriate action and to execute any
          and all documents and instruments which may be necessary or desirable
          to accomplish the purposes of this Agreement, and, without limiting
          the generality of the foregoing, Factors hereby gives the Agent the
          power and right, on behalf of Factors, without notice to or assent by
          Factors, to do the following at any time when any Event of Default
          shall have occurred and be continuing, and to the extent permitted by
          Applicable Law:

                          (i) in the name of Factors or its own name, or
                 otherwise, to take possession of and indorse and collect any
                 checks, drafts, notes, acceptances or other instruments for the
                 payment of moneys due under any Account, Contract, Instrument
                 or General Intangible (to the extent that any of the foregoing
                 constitute Collateral) or with respect to any other Collateral
                 and to file any claim or to take any other action or institute
                 any proceeding in any court of law or equity or otherwise
                 deemed appropriate by the Agent for the purpose of collecting
                 any and all such moneys due under any such Account, Contract,
                 Instrument or General Intangible or with respect to any such
                 other Collateral whenever payable;

                          (ii) to pay or discharge taxes and Liens levied or
                 placed on the Collateral, other than Permitted Liens, to effect
                 any repairs or any insurance required by the terms of this
                 Agreement and to pay all or any part of the premiums therefor
                 and the costs thereof; and

                          (iii) (A) to direct any party liable for any payment
                 with respect to any of the Collateral to make payment of any
                 and all moneys due or to become due thereunder directly to the
                 Agent or as the Agent shall direct; (B) to ask for, or demand,
                 collect, receive payment of and receipt for, any and all
                 moneys, claims and other amounts due or to become due at any
                 time in respect of or arising out of any Collateral; (C) to
                 sign and indorse any invoices, freight or express bills, bills
                 of lading, storage or warehouse receipts, drafts against
                 debtors, assignments, verifications, notices and other
                 documents in connection with any of the Collateral; (D) to
                 commence and prosecute any suits, actions or proceedings at law
                 or in equity in any court of competent jurisdiction to collect
                 the Collateral or any thereof and to enforce any other right in
                 respect of any Collateral; (E) to defend any suit, action or
                 proceeding brought against Factors with respect to any of the
                 Collateral; (F)

                                       15

<PAGE>

                 to settle, compromise or adjust any suit, action or proceeding
                 described in clause (E) above and, in connection therewith, to
                 give such discharges or releases as the Agent may deem
                 appropriate; (G) subject to any pre-existing rights or
                 licenses, to assign any Patent or Trademark (along with the
                 goodwill of the business to which any such Patent or Trademark
                 pertains), for such term or terms, on such conditions, and in
                 such manner, as the Agent shall in its sole discretion
                 determine; and (H) generally, to sell, transfer, pledge and
                 make any agreement with respect to or otherwise deal with any
                 of the Collateral as fully and completely as though the Agent
                 were the absolute owner thereof for all purposes, and to do, at
                 the Agent's option and Factors's expense, at any time, or from
                 time to time, all acts and things which the Agent deems
                 necessary to protect, preserve or realize upon the Collateral
                 and the Agent's Liens thereon and to effect the intent of this
                 Agreement, all as fully and effectively as Factors might do.

          Factors hereby ratifies all that said attorneys shall lawfully do or
          cause to be done by virtue hereof. This power of attorney is a power
          coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable until payment in
          full of the Obligations (except for contingent obligations of any
          Obligor under indemnifications that survive termination of the
          Revolver Commitments) and the termination of all Revolver Commitments.

                 (b)      Other Powers. Factors also authorizes the Agent, from
          time to time if an Event of Default shall have occurred and be
          continuing, to execute, in connection with any sale provided for in
          Section10 hereof, any endorsements, assignments or other instruments
          of conveyance or transfer with respect to the Collateral.

                 (c)      No Duty on the Part of Agent or Lenders. The powers
          conferred on the Agent and the Lenders hereunder are solely to protect
          the Agent's and the Lenders' interests in the Collateral and shall not
          impose any duty upon the Agent or any Lender to exercise any such
          powers. The Agent and the Lenders shall be accountable only for
          amounts that they actually receive as a result of the exercise of such
          powers, and neither they nor any of their officers, directors,
          employees or agents shall be responsible to Factors for any act or
          failure to act hereunder, except for their own gross negligence or
          willful misconduct.

          7.     Performance by Agent of Factors's Obligations. If Factors fails
to perform or comply with any of its agreements contained herein and the Agent,
as provided for by the terms of this Agreement, shall itself perform or comply,
or otherwise cause performance or compliance, with such agreement, the
reasonable expenses of the Agent incurred in connection with such performance or
compliance, together with interest thereon at the Default Rate shall be payable
by Factors to the Agent on demand and shall constitute Obligations secured
hereby.

          8.     Proceeds. It is agreed that if an Event of Default shall occur
and be continuing, (a) all Proceeds of any Collateral received by Factors
consisting of cash, checks and other near-cash items

                                       16

<PAGE>

shall be held by Factors in trust for the Agent and the Lenders, segregated from
other funds of Factors, and at the request of the Agent shall, forthwith upon
receipt by Factors, be turned over to the Agent in the exact form received by
Factors (duly indorsed by Factors to the Agent, if required by the Agent), and
(b) any and all such Proceeds received by the Agent (whether from Factors or
otherwise) may, in the sole discretion of the Agent, be held by the Agent, as
collateral security for the Obligations (whether matured or unmatured), and then
or at any time thereafter may be applied by the Agent against, the Obligations
then due and owing. Any balance of such Proceeds remaining after the payment in
full of the Obligations (except for contingent obligations of any Obligor under
indemnifications that survive termination of the Revolver Commitments) and the
termination of all the Revolver Commitments, shall be paid over to Factors or to
whomsoever may be lawfully entitled to receive the same.

          9.     Events of Default. It is understood and agreed that an event of
default shall be deemed to have occurred under this Agreement, and Agent shall
be entitled to take such actions as are elsewhere provided herein, in the event
that an Event of Default under and (as defined in) the Credit Agreement or any
of the other Credit Documents shall have occurred.

          10.    Remedies. If an Event of Default shall occur and be continuing,
the Agent may (and, upon written instructions to do so from the Required
Lenders, shall) exercise all rights and remedies of a secured party under the
UCC, together with every right and remedy available to Agent, under any other
Applicable Law, and, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, all other rights
and remedies granted to them in this Agreement and in any other instrument or
agreement securing, evidencing or relating to the Obligations. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, the Agent, without demand of performance or
other demand, presentment, protest, advertisement or notice of any kind (except
any notice required by law referred to below) to or upon Factors or any other
Person (all and each of which demands, defenses, advertisements and notices are
hereby waived), may (and upon written instructions to do so from the Required
Lenders, shall) in such circumstances, to the extent permitted by Applicable
Law, forthwith collect, receive, appropriate and realize upon the Collateral, or
any part thereof, and may forthwith sell, lease, assign, give option or options
to purchase, or otherwise dispose of and deliver the Collateral or any part
thereof (or contract to do any of the foregoing), whether on Factors's premises
or elsewhere, but subject to any pre-existing rights or licenses, in one or more
parcels at public or private sale or sales, at any exchange, broker's board or
office of the Agent or any Lender or elsewhere upon such terms and conditions as
it may deem advisable and at such prices as it may deem best, for cash or on
credit or for future delivery without assumption of any credit risk. The Agent
or any Lender shall have the right, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law,
upon any such sale or sales, to purchase the whole or any part of the Collateral
so sold, free of any right or equity of redemption in Factors, which right or
equity is hereby waived or released. Factors further agrees, at the Agent's
request, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default,
to assemble the Collateral and make it available to the Agent at places which
the Agent shall reasonably select, whether at Factors's premises or elsewhere.
Alternatively, Agent may peaceably by its own means or with judicial assistance
enter Factors's premises and take possession of the Collateral or dispose of the
Collateral on Factors's premises without resistance or interference by Factors.
The Agent shall apply the net proceeds of any such

                                       17

<PAGE>

collection, recovery, receipt, appropriation, realization or sale, after
deducting all reasonable costs and expenses of every kind incurred therein or
incidental to the care or safekeeping of any of the Collateral or in any way
relating to the Collateral or the rights of the Agent and the Lenders hereunder,
including reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements, to the payment in whole
or in part of the Obligations then due and owing, and only after such
application and after the payment by the Agent of any other amount required by
any provision of Applicable Law, need the Agent account for the surplus, if any,
to Factors. To the extent permitted by Applicable Law, Factors waives all
claims, damages and demands it may acquire against the Agent or any Lender
arising out of the repossession, retention or sale of the Collateral, other than
any such claims, damages and demands that may arise from the gross negligence or
willful misconduct of any of them. If any notice of a proposed sale or other
disposition of Collateral shall be required by law, such notice shall be deemed
reasonable and proper if given at least 10 days before such sale or other
disposition. Factors shall remain liable for any deficiency if the proceeds of
any sale or other disposition of the Collateral are insufficient to pay the then
outstanding Obligations, including the reasonable fees and disbursements of any
attorneys employed by the Agent or any Lender to collect such deficiency.

          11.    Limitation on Duties Regarding Preservation of Collateral. The
Agent's sole duty with respect to the custody, safekeeping and physical
preservation of the Collateral in its possession, under Section 9-207 of the UCC
or otherwise, shall be to deal with it in the same manner as the Agent deals
with similar property for its own account. Except as provided in the foregoing
sentence or elsewhere herein or in any other Credit Document, neither the Agent
nor any Lender shall be liable or responsible to Factors in any way for the
safeguarding of any of the Collateral, for any loss or damage thereto, for any
diminution in the value thereof, or for any act or default of any carrier,
warehouseman, forwarding agency, or other person whomsoever, but the same shall
be at all times at Factors's risk.

          12.    Waivers. In addition to the other waivers contained herein and
in any other Credit Document, Factors hereby expressly waives, to the extent
permitted by Applicable Law: demand, protest, notice of protest, notice of
default or dishonor, notice of payments and nonpayments, or of any default,
release, compromise, settlement, extension or renewal of all commercial paper,
instruments or guaranties at any time held by Agent or any of the Lenders on
which Factors may in any way be liable; notice or hearing in connection with,
and the requirement to post a bond as a condition to, the issuance of an
immediate writ of possession with respect to any of the Collateral; any
requirement that the Agent or any of the Lenders protect, secure, perfect or
insure any Lien or any property subject thereto or exhaust any right or take any
action against any Obligor or any other Person or any Collateral, including any
rights any Obligor may otherwise have under the New York General Obligations
Law; and notice of any action taken by Agent, in each case unless expressly
required by this Agreement, any other Credit Document or by Applicable Law.

          13.    Powers Coupled with an Interest. All authorizations and
agencies herein contained with respect to the Collateral are powers coupled with
an interest and are irrevocable until payment in full of the Obligations (except
for contingent obligations of any Obligor under indemnifications

                                       18

<PAGE>

that survive termination of the Revolver Commitments) and the termination of all
Revolver Commitments.

          14.    Severability. Any provision of this Agreement which is
prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction,
be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without
invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or
unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render
unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.

          15.    Section Headings. The section headings used in this Agreement
are for convenience of reference only and are not to affect the construction
hereof or be taken into consideration in the interpretation hereof.

          16.    No Waiver; Cumulative Remedies. Neither the Agent nor any
Lender shall by any act (except by a written instrument pursuant to Section 17
hereof), delay, indulgence, omission or otherwise be deemed to have waived any
right or remedy hereunder or to have acquiesced in any Default or Event of
Default or in any breach of any of the terms and conditions hereof. No failure
to exercise, nor any delay in exercising, on the part of the Agent or any
Lender, any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver
thereof. No single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege
hereunder shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise
of any other right, power or privilege. A waiver by the Agent or any Lender of
any right or remedy hereunder on any one occasion shall not be construed as a
bar to any right or remedy which the Agent or such Lender would otherwise have
on any future occasion. The rights and remedies herein provided are cumulative,
may be exercised singly or concurrently and are not exclusive of any rights or
remedies provided by law.

          17.    Amendments in Writing; No Waiver; Cumulative Remedies;
Successors and Assigns. None of the terms or provisions of this Agreement may be
waived, amended, supplemented or otherwise modified except by a written
instrument executed by Factors and the Agent. This Agreement shall be binding
upon the successors and assigns of Factors and shall inure to the benefit of the
Agent and the Lenders and their respective successors and assigns, except that
Factors may not assign, transfer or delegate any of its rights or obligations
under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the Agent.

          18.    Notices. All notices, requests and demands to or upon the
respective parties hereto shall be made in accordance with Section 15.9 of the
Credit Agreement.

          19.    Authority of Agent. Factors acknowledges that the rights and
responsibilities of the Agent under this Agreement with respect to any action
taken by the Agent or the exercise or non-exercise by the Agent of any option,
voting right, request, judgment or other right or remedy provided for herein or
resulting or arising out of this Agreement shall, as among the Agent and the
Lenders be governed by the Credit Documents and by such other agreements with
respect thereto as may exist from time to time among them, but, as between the
Agent and Factors, the Agent shall be

                                       19

<PAGE>

conclusively presumed to be acting as agent for the Lenders with full and valid
authority so to act or refrain from acting, and Factors shall not be under any
obligation to make any inquiry respecting such authority.

          20.    GOVERNING LAW. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND
CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK (WITHOUT GIVING
EFFECT TO THE CONFLICT OF LAWS PRINCIPLES THEREOF, OTHER THAN SECTION 5-1401 OF
THE NEW YORK GENERAL OBLIGATIONS LAW); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT IF ANY COLLATERAL
SHALL BE LOCATED IN ANY JURISDICTION OTHER THAN NEW YORK, THE LAWS OF SUCH
JURISDICTION SHALL GOVERN THE METHOD, MANNER AND PROCEDURE FOR FORECLOSURE OF
AGENT'S LIEN UPON COLLATERAL AND THE ENFORCEMENT OF AGENT'S OTHER REMEDIES OF
COLLATERAL TO THE EXTENT THAT THE LAWS OF SUCH JURISDICTION ARE DIFFERENT FROM
OR INCONSISTENT WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK. NOTWITHSTANDING THE
FOREGOING PROVISION FOR THE NOTICE AND SALE OF COLLATERAL UNDER THE LAW OF THE
SITUS, IT IS THE PARTIES' INTENTION THAT NEW YORK LAW CONTROL THE OBLIGATIONS OF
FACTORS UNDER THE CREDIT DOCUMENTS AND THE ENFORCEMENT OF THE SAME SUCH THAT,
FOR EXAMPLE, FACTORS AGREES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT PURSUANT TO NEW YORK LAW
FACTORS SHALL BE LIABLE FOR A DEFICIENCY JUDGMENT NOTWITHSTANDING THE SALE OF
REAL PROPERTY COLLATERAL UNDER A POWER OF SALE AND FURTHER THAT LENDERS OR AGENT
MAY, AT THEIR ELECTION, SEEK A MONEY JUDGMENT UNDER THE CREDIT DOCUMENTS WITHOUT
FIRST EXHAUSTING ALL COLLATERAL SECURING THE OBLIGATIONS THEREUNDER.

          21.    Release of Collateral and Termination.

                 (a)      At such time as the payment in full of the Obligations
          (except for contingent obligations of any Obligor under
          indemnifications that survive termination of the Revolver Commitments)
          and the termination of all Revolver Commitments shall have occurred,
          the Collateral shall be released from the Liens created hereby, and
          this Agreement and all obligations (other than those expressly stated
          to survive such termination) of the Agent and Factors hereunder shall
          terminate, all without delivery of any instrument or performance of
          any act by any party, and all rights to the Collateral shall revert to
          Factors. Upon request of Factors following any such termination, the
          Agent shall deliver (at the sole cost and expense of Factors) to
          Factors any Collateral held by the Agent hereunder, and execute and
          deliver (at the sole cost and expense of Factors) to Factors such
          documents as Factors shall reasonably request to evidence such
          termination.

                 (b)      If any of the Collateral shall be sold, transferred or
          otherwise disposed of by Factors in a transaction permitted by the
          Credit Agreement, then the Agent shall execute and deliver to Factors
          (at the sole cost and expense of Factors) all releases or other
          documents

                                       20

<PAGE>

          reasonably necessary or desirable for the release of the Liens created
          hereby on such Collateral.

                                       21

          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Factors has caused this Agreement to be duly
executed and delivered as of the date first above written.
