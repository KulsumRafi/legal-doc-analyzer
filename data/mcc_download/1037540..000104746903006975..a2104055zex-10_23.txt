higher of the two Debt Ratings if the lower Debt Rating is no more than one
level lower than the higher Debt Rating, and (ii) based on the average of the
two Debt Ratings if the lower Debt Rating is more than one level lower than the
higher Debt Rating. Adjustments in the Eurodollar Spread (bps) for a Eurodollar

Closing Date, also the conditions in Section 12) have been met at the time of
such request, and (ii) there has not occurred and is not continuing (or will not
occur by reason thereof) any Default or Event of Default; it being acknowledged

writing by the Agent and the required number of Banks) on the proposed Drawdown
Date of the requested Loan or issuance of Letter of Credit, as the case may be,

required to be made by any Bank unless (in connection with the initial Revolving
Credit Loan or Letter of Credit or other extension of credit) all of the
conditions contained in Section 12 have been satisfied (except to the extent any
such condition has been waived and/or deferred in writing by the Agent and the
required

                                      -32-

Credit Loan or at the time of receipt of any payment of principal on such Bank's
Revolving Credit Notes, an appropriate notation on such Bank's applicable Note
Record reflecting the making of such Revolving Credit Loan or (as the case may
be) the receipt of such payment. The outstanding amount of the Revolving Credit
Loans set forth on such applicable Note Record shall be PRIMA FACIE evidence of
the principal amount thereof owing and unpaid to such Bank, but the failure to
record, or any error in so recording, any such amount on such Note Record shall
not limit or otherwise affect the rights and obligations of the Borrower
hereunder or under any Revolving Credit Note to make payments of principal of or
interest on any Revolving Credit Note when due.

                   -- TIME SENSITIVE -- MUST RESPOND WITHIN [2/4] DAYS" and with
                   the appropriate period filled in. Except as otherwise
                   provided herein, each Completed Loan Request shall be in a
                   minimum amount of $1,000,000 or an integral multiple of
                   $100,000 in excess thereof. Each Completed Loan Request shall
                   be irrevocable and binding on the Borrower and shall obligate
                   the Borrower to accept the Revolving Credit Loans requested

                   Completed Loan Request is withdrawn (x) in the case of a
                   request for a Eurodollar Rate Loan, at least four (4)
                   Business Days prior to the proposed Drawdown Date for such
                   Loan, and (y) in the case of a request for a Prime Rate Loan,
                   at least two (2) Business Days prior to the proposed Drawdown
                   Date for such Loan.

                            (ii)  Each Completed Loan Request shall be delivered
                   by the Borrower to the Agent by 10:00 a.m. on any Business
                   Day, and at least two (2) Business Days prior to the proposed

                   Business Days prior to the proposed Drawdown Date of any
                   Eurodollar Rate Loan.

                            (iii) Each Completed Loan Request shall include a
                   completed writing in the form of EXHIBIT B hereto specifying:
                   (1) the principal amount of the Revolving Credit Loan

                   Credit Loan, (3) the Interest Period applicable to such
                   Revolving Credit Loan, and (4) the Type of such Revolving
                   Credit Loan being requested.

                            (iv)  No Bank shall be obligated to fund any
                   Revolving Credit Loan or issue any Letter of Credit unless:

                                  (a) a Completed Loan Request has been timely
                        received by the Agent as provided in subsection (i)
                        above; and

                                  (b) both before and after giving effect to the
                        Revolving Credit Loan to be made or Letter of Credit to
                        be issued pursuant to the Completed Loan Request, all of
                        the conditions contained in Section 12 shall have been
                        satisfied (to the extent such conditions have not been
                        waived and/or deferred in writing by the Agent and the
                        required number of Banks prior to the initial advance)
                        as of the Closing Date, with respect to the initial
                        advance only, and all of the conditions set forth in
                        Section 13 shall have been met, including, without
                        limitation, the condition under Section 13.1 that there
                        be no Default or Event of Default under this Agreement;
                        and

                                  (c) the Agent shall have received (with copies
                        to the Agent for each Bank) a certificate in the form of
                        EXHIBIT C-1 hereto signed by the chief financial
                        officer, treasurer or controller of the Borrower setting
                        forth computations evidencing compliance with the
                        covenants contained in Section 10 on a PRO FORMA basis
                        after giving effect to such requested Revolving Credit
                        Loan (including, without limitation, a certification
                        that, to the best of the Borrower's

                                      -35-
<Page>

                        knowledge, if the Borrowing Base Value and the Borrowing
                        Base Debt Service Coverage Ratio were to be calculated
                        on the Drawdown Date of any Revolving Credit Loan for
                        the period through the Drawdown Date rather than through
                        the last day of the most recently completed fiscal
                        quarter, there would be sufficient Borrowing Base
                        Availability for the requested Revolving Credit Loan),
                        and certifying that, both before and after giving effect
                        to such requested Revolving Credit Loan or Letter of
                        Credit, no Default or Event of Default exists or will
                        exist under this Agreement or any other Loan Document,
                        and that after taking into account such requested
                        Revolving Credit Loan or Letter of Credit, no Default or
                        Event of Default will exist as of the Drawdown Date.

                            (v) The Agent will use best efforts to cause the
                   Completed Loan Request to be delivered to each Bank on the
                   same day it is received by the Agent and will, absent
                   circumstances outside of its control, cause the Completed
                   Loan Request to be delivered to each Bank on the Business Day
                   following the day a Completed Loan Request is received by the
                   Agent.

    Section 2.5.   CONVERSION OPTIONS.

                   (a) The Borrower may elect from time to time to convert any
outstanding Revolving Credit Loan to a Revolving Credit Loan of another Type,
PROVIDED that (i) with respect to any such conversion of a Eurodollar Rate Loan
to a Prime Rate Loan, such conversion shall take place automatically at the end
of the applicable Interest Period unless the Borrower provides notice to the
Agent of its request to continue such Loan as a Eurodollar Rate Loan as provided
in Section 2.5(b) and Section 2.5(a)(ii); (ii) subject to the further proviso at
the end of this Section 2.5(a) and subject to Section 2.5(b) and Section 2.5(d),
with respect to any conversion of a Prime Rate Loan to a Eurodollar Rate Loan
(or a continuation of a Eurodollar Rate Loan, as provided in Section 2.5(b)),
the Borrower shall give the Agent (with copies to the Agent for each Bank) at
least four (4) Eurodollar Business Days' prior written notice of such election,
which such notice must be received by the Agent by 10:00 a.m. on any Business
Day; and (iii) no Loan may be converted into a Eurodollar Rate Loan when any
Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing. All or any part of
outstanding Revolving Credit Loans of any Type may be converted as provided
herein, PROVIDED that each Conversion Request relating to the conversion of a
Prime Rate Loan to a Eurodollar Rate Loan shall be for an amount equal to
$1,000,000 or an integral multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof and shall be
irrevocable by the Borrower.

                   (b) Any Revolving Credit Loan of any Type may be continued as
such upon the expiration of the Interest Period with respect thereto (i) in the
case of Prime Rate Loans, automatically and (ii) in the case of Eurodollar Rate
Loans by compliance by the Borrower with the notice provisions contained in
Section 2.5(a)(ii); PROVIDED that no Eurodollar

                                      -36-
<Page>

Rate Loan may be continued as such when any Default or Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing but shall be automatically converted to a Prime Rate
Loan on the last day of the first Interest Period relating thereto ending during
the continuance of any Default or Event of Default. The Borrower shall notify
the Agent promptly when any such automatic conversion contemplated by this
Section 2.5(b) is scheduled to occur.

                   (c) In the event that the Borrower does not notify the Agent
of its election hereunder with respect to any Revolving Credit Loan, such Loan
shall be automatically converted to a Prime Rate Loan at the end of the
applicable Interest Period.

                   (d) The Borrower may not request or elect a Eurodollar Rate
Loan pursuant to Section 2.4, elect to convert a Prime Rate Loan to a Eurodollar
Loan pursuant to Section 2.5(a) or elect to continue a Eurodollar Rate Loan
pursuant to Section 2.5(b) if, after giving effect thereto, there would be
greater than six (6) Eurodollar Rate Loans then outstanding. Any Loan Request or
Conversion Request for a Eurodollar Rate Loan that would create greater than six
(6) Eurodollar Rate Loans outstanding shall be deemed to be a Loan Request or
Conversion Request for a Prime Rate Loan. By way of explanation of the
foregoing, in the event that the Borrower wishes to convert or continue two or
more Loans into one Eurodollar Rate Loan on the same day and for identical
Interest Periods (or borrow an additional Revolving Credit Loan simultaneously
with converting or continuing a Revolving Credit Loan for identical Interest
Periods), such Eurodollar Rate Loan shall constitute one single Eurodollar Rate
Loan for purposes of this clause (d).

    Section 2.6.   FUNDS FOR REVOLVING CREDIT LOANS.

                   (a) Subject to the other provisions of this Section 2, not
later than 11:00 a.m. (Boston time) on the proposed Drawdown Date of any
Revolving Credit Loan, each of the Banks will make available to the Agent, at
its Head Office, in immediately available funds, the amount of such Bank's
Commitment Percentage of the amount of the requested Revolving Credit Loan. Upon
receipt from each Bank of such amount, the Agent will make available to the
Borrower the aggregate amount of such Revolving Credit Loan made available to
the Agent by the Banks. All such funds received by the Agent by 11:00 a.m.
(Boston Time) on any Business Day will be made available to the Borrower not
later than 2:00 p.m. on the same Business Day; funds received after such time
will be made available by not later than 11:00 a.m. on the next Business Day
(provided that as to any Bank which is required to fund Revolving Credit Loans
from its head office located in the Pacific Time Zone (U.S.), the preceding
reference to `11:00 a.m.' shall be deemed to be a reference to `1:00 p.m.'). The
failure or refusal of any Bank to make available to the Agent at the aforesaid
time and place on any Drawdown Date the amount of its Commitment Percentage of
the requested Revolving Credit Loan shall not relieve any other Bank from its
several obligation hereunder to make available to the Agent the amount of its
Commitment Percentage of any requested Revolving Credit Loan but in no event
shall the Agent (in its capacity as Agent) have any obligation to make any
funding or shall any Bank be obligated to fund more than its Commitment
Percentage of the

                                      -37-
<Page>

requested Revolving Credit Loan or to increase its Commitment Percentage on
account of such failure or otherwise.

                   (b) The Agent may, unless notified to the contrary by any
Bank prior to a Drawdown Date, assume that such Bank has made available to the
Agent on such Drawdown Date the amount of such Bank's Commitment Percentage of
the Revolving Credit Loan to be made on such Drawdown Date, and the Agent may
(but it shall not be required to), in reliance upon such assumption, make
available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. If any Bank makes available to
the Agent such amount on a date after such Drawdown Date, such Bank shall pay to
the Agent on demand an amount equal to the product of (i) the average, computed
for the period referred to in clause (iii) below, of the weighted average
interest rate paid by the Agent for federal funds acquired by the Agent during
each day included in such period, MULTIPLIED BY (ii) the amount of such Bank's
Commitment Percentage of such Revolving Credit Loan, MULTIPLIED BY (iii) a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days that elapsed from and
including such Drawdown Date to the date on which the amount of such Bank's
Commitment Percentage of such Revolving Credit Loan shall become immediately
available to the Agent, and the denominator of which is 365. A statement of the
Agent submitted to such Bank with respect to any amounts owing under this
paragraph shall be PRIMA FACIE evidence of the amount due and owing to the Agent
by such Bank.

    Section 2.7.   REDUCTION OF COMMITMENT. The Borrower shall have the right at
any time and from time to time upon five (5) Business Days' prior written notice
to the Agent (with copies to the Agent for each Bank) to reduce by $500,000 or
an integral multiple thereof or terminate entirely the unborrowed portion of the
then Total Commitment, whereupon the Commitments of the Banks shall be reduced
PRO RATA in accordance with their respective Commitment Percentages by the
amount specified in such notice or, as the case may be, terminated. Upon the
effective date of any such reduction or termination, the Borrower shall pay to
the Agent for the respective accounts of the Banks the full amount of the
Facility Fee then accrued and unpaid on the amount of the reduction. No
reduction or termination of the Commitments may be reinstated.

    Section 2.8.   SWINGLINE LOANS.

                   (a) AVAILABILITY. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and so long as the Swingline Lender does not have knowledge that any
Default or Event of Default exists or will exist after giving effect to the
applicable Swingline Loan, and the Borrower has delivered to the Agent a loan
request, including the certificate referred to in Section 2.4(iv)(c), as if all
references in Section 2.4(iv)(c) to Revolving Credit Loans were to Swingline
Loans, the Swingline Lender agrees to make Swingline Loans to the Borrower from
time to time from the Closing Date to, but not including, the Swingline
Termination Date; PROVIDED, that the aggregate principal amount of all
outstanding Swingline Loans (after giving effect to any amount requested) at any
time, shall not exceed the lesser of (i) the Total Commitment in effect at such
time LESS the sum

                                      -38-
<Page>

of (A) all outstanding Revolving Credit Loans at such time (after giving effect
to all amounts requested), (B) the Maximum Drawing Amount and, without
double-counting the portion, if any, of any Letter of Credit which is drawn and
included in the Revolving Credit Loans or the Maximum Drawing Amount, all
outstanding Reimbursement Obligations at such time, and (C) all outstanding Bid
Rate Loans at such time, (ii) the Borrowing Base Availability at such time and
(iii) the Swingline Commitment at such time. Swingline Loans hereunder may be
used in anticipation of borrowing Revolving Credit Loans, Bid Rate Loans and for
other short-term requirements and shall be repaid in accordance with the terms
hereof. Each Swingline Loan must be for an amount equal to at least $1,000,000
and in an integral multiple of $100,000 and shall be evidenced by the Swingline
Note. The Swingline Lender shall initiate the transfer of funds representing the
Swingline Loan to the Borrower by 4:00 p.m. (Boston time) on the Business Day of
the requested borrowing, so long as the Swingline Loan has been requested by the
Borrower no later than 1:00 p.m. (Boston time) on such Business Day. In no event
shall the number of Swingline Loans outstanding at any time exceed three (3).
All Swingline Loans shall bear interest at the Prime Rate plus the Applicable
Prime Rate Margin. The Borrower unconditionally promises to pay interest on each
Swingline Loan in arrears on each Interest Payment Date with respect thereto.

                   (b) REPAYMENT. The Borrower hereby absolutely and
unconditionally promises to repay the outstanding principal amount of each
Swingline Loan and all accrued interest and charges thereon (the "Swingline Loan
Amount") on the earliest to occur of: (i) the fifth (5th) Business Day after the
date on which the Swingline Loan is advanced or (ii) the Swingline Termination
Date; PROVIDED, the Borrower shall have the right to prepay Swingline Loans
without penalty or any prepayment charge.

                   (c) REFUNDING AND CONVERSION OF SWINGLINE LOANS TO REVOLVING
CREDIT LOANS.

                       (i)   On the maturity of each Swingline Loan (which shall
be no longer than the period for repayment set forth above in Section 2.8(b)),
the Borrower shall be deemed to have requested on such date a Revolving Credit
Loan comprised solely of a Prime Rate Loan in a principal amount equal to the
Swingline Loan Amount in order to repay such Swingline Loan. Such refundings of
the Swingline Loan through the funding of such Revolving Credit Loans shall be
made by the Banks in accordance with their respective Commitment Percentages and
shall thereafter be reflected as Revolving Credit Loans of the Banks on the
books and records of the Agent.

                       (ii)  If a Default or an Event of Default has occurred
and is continuing, all Swingline Loans shall be refunded by the Banks on demand
by the Swingline Lender, in which case the Borrower shall be deemed to have
requested on such date of demand a Revolving Credit Loan comprised solely of a
Prime Rate Loan in a principal amount equal to the Swingline Loan Amount for
such Swingline Loans. Such refundings of the Swingline Loans through the funding
of such Revolving Credit Loans

                                      -39-
<Page>

shall be made by the Banks in accordance with their respective Commitment
Percentages and shall thereafter be reflected as Revolving Credit Loans of the
Banks on the books and records of the Agent.

                       (iii) Each Bank shall fund its respective Commitment
Percentage of Revolving Credit Loans as required to so repay Swingline Loans
outstanding to the Swingline Lender upon such deemed request or demand by the
Swingline Lender but in no event later than 2:00 p.m. (Boston time) on the next
succeeding Business Day after such deemed request or demand is made. No Bank's
obligation to fund its respective Commitment Percentage of the repayment of a
Swingline Loan shall be affected by any other Bank's failure to fund its
Commitment Percentage of such repayment, nor shall any Bank's Commitment
Percentage be increased as a result of any such failure of any other Bank to
fund its Commitment Percentage. To the extent any Bank does not fund its
respective Commitment Percentage of any Revolving Credit Loan to the Borrower
pursuant to this Section 2.8(c)(iii), such Bank shall be deemed a Delinquent
Bank and the Borrower shall repay such amounts to the Swingline Lender in
accordance with the provisions of Section 4.3 as if such Loan were a Revolving
Credit Loan for which a Bank did not remit its share to the Agent. If any
portion of any such amount paid to the Swingline Lender shall be recovered by or
on behalf of the Borrower from the Swingline Lender in bankruptcy or otherwise,
the loss of the amount so recovered shall be ratably shared among all the Banks.

                       (iv)  If at any time the Borrower receives notice from
the Swingline Lender that the aggregate principal amount of all Revolving Credit
Loans outstanding, PLUS the aggregate principal amount of all Swingline Loans
outstanding (including the Swingline Loan for which demand for payment is then
made by the Swingline Lender pursuant to this subsection), PLUS the Maximum
Drawing Amount and, PLUS, without double-counting the portion, if any, of any
Letter of Credit which is drawn and included in the Revolving Credit Loans or
the Maximum Drawing Amount, all outstanding Reimbursement Obligations at such
time, PLUS all outstanding Bid Rate Loans at such time, equals or exceeds the
lesser of (A) Total Commitment at such time and (B) the Borrowing Base
Availability at such time, the Borrower shall repay the amount of such excess
upon demand by the Swingline Lender, which payment shall be applied first to the
Swingline Loans, second to the Revolving Credit Loans and thereafter to the Bid
Rate Loans.

                       (v)   Each Bank acknowledges and agrees that its
obligation to refund Swingline Loans with Revolving Credit Loans in accordance
with the terms of this Section 2.8 is absolute and unconditional and shall not
be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including, in any event,
non-satisfaction of any conditions set forth in this Agreement pertaining to
advances of Revolving Credit Loans hereunder, except to the limited extent
expressly referred to in the first sentence of Section 2.8(a). Further, each
Bank agrees and acknowledges that if, prior to the refunding of any outstanding
Swingline Loans pursuant to this Section 2.8, one of the events described in
Sections 14.1(g) or (h) shall have

                                      -40-
<Page>

occurred, each Bank will, on the date the applicable Revolving Credit Loan would
have been made pursuant to Section 2.8(c)(i) or (ii), purchase an undivided
participating interest in the Swingline Loan to be refunded in an amount equal
to its Commitment Percentage of such Swingline Loan Amount. Each Bank will
immediately transfer to the Swingline Lender, in immediately available funds,
the amount of its participation. Whenever, at any time after the Swingline
Lender has received from any Bank such Bank's participating interest in a
Swingline Loan, the Swingline Lender receives any payment on account thereof,
the Swingline Lender will distribute to such Bank its participating interest in
such amount (appropriately adjusted, in the case of interest payments, to
reflect the period of time during which such Bank's participating interest was
outstanding and funded).

                       (vi)  Each Bank's Commitment Percentage applicable to any
Swingline Loan shall be identical to its Commitment Percentage applicable to
Revolving Credit Loans.

    Section 2.9.   BID RATE ADVANCES.

                   (a) Each Bank severally agrees that, on the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement, the Borrower may request and receive Bid
Rate Advances under this Section 2.9 from time to time on any Business Day
during the period from the date hereof until the date occurring 30 days prior to
the Maturity Date in the manner set forth below; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that:

                       (i)   following the making of each Bid Rate Advance, the
                   aggregate principal amount of all Revolving Credit Loans then
                   outstanding, PLUS the aggregate amount of all Swingline Loans
                   then outstanding, PLUS the aggregate amount of all Bid Rate
                   Advances then outstanding (including the requested Bid Rate
                   Advance), PLUS the Maximum Drawing Amount and, without
                   double-counting the portion, if any, of any Letter of Credit
                   which is drawn and included in the Revolving Credit Loans or
                   the Maximum Drawing Amount, PLUS all outstanding
                   Reimbursement Obligations at such time, shall not exceed the
                   lesser of (A) the Total Commitment in effect at such time or
                   (B) the Borrowing Base Availability in effect at such time;

                       (ii)  at no time shall the aggregate amount of all Bid
                   Rate Advances then outstanding (including the requested Bid
                   Rate Advance) exceed the Bid Rate Maximum Amount; and

                       (iii) at the time the Borrower requests a Bid Rate
                   Advance and after giving effect to the making thereof, no
                   Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing.

                   (b) The procedures for the solicitation and acceptance of Bid
Rate Loans are set forth below (with the references to time of day meaning
Boston, Massachusetts time):

                       (i)   The Borrower may request a Bid Rate Advance under
                   this Section 2.9(b) by giving the Agent irrevocable notice,
                   in the form attached hereto as Exhibit D-2 (a "Bid Rate
                   Advance Borrowing Notice"), specifying the date and aggregate
                   amount of the proposed Bid Rate Advance, the maturity date
                   for repayment of each Bid Rate Loan to be made as part of
                   such Bid Rate Advance (which maturity date may not be earlier
                   than, in the case of an Absolute Rate Auction, the date
                   occurring one day, and in the case of an Indexed Rate
                   Auction, the date occurring seven days, after the date of the
                   related Bid Rate Advance or later than, in either case, the
                   earlier of the day occurring 180 days after the date of such
                   Bid Rate Advance and the Maturity Date), and any other terms
                   to be applicable to such Bid Rate Advance, not later than
                   11:00 a.m. (A) in the case of an Absolute Rate Auction, one
                   (1) Business Day prior to the date of the proposed Bid Rate
                   Advance, and (B) in the case of an Indexed Rate Auction, four
                   (4) Business Days prior to the date of the proposed Bid Rate
                   Advance. The Agent shall, promptly following its receipt of a
                   Bid Rate Advance Borrowing Notice under this Section 2.9(b),
                   notify each Bank of such request by sending such Bank a copy
                   of such Bid Rate Advance Borrowing Notice.

                       (ii)  Each Bank may, if, in its sole discretion, it
                   elects to do so, irrevocably offer to make one or more Bid
                   Rate Loans to the Borrower as part of such proposed Bid Rate
                   Advance at a rate or rates of interest specified by such Bank
                   in its sole discretion, by providing written notice to the
                   Agent (which shall give prompt notice thereof to the
                   Borrower), before 12:00 p.m. (or if such Bank is serving as
                   the Agent, before 11:30 a.m.) on (A) the date of such
                   proposed Bid Rate Advance, in the case of an Absolute Rate
                   Auction, and (B) the date that is three Business Days before
                   the date of such proposed Bid Rate Advance, in the case of an
                   Indexed Rate Auction, in the form of Exhibit D-3 attached
                   hereto (the "Competitive Bid Notice") of the minimum amount
                   and maximum amount of each Bid Rate Loan which such Bank
                   would be willing to make as part of such proposed Bid Rate
                   Advance (which amounts may, subject to the proviso to the
                   first sentence of Section 2.9(a), exceed such Bank's
                   Commitment) and the rate or rates of interest therefor.

                       Any Competitive Bid Notice shall be disregarded and given
                   no effect if it contains qualifying or conditional language,
                   proposes terms and conditions other than or in addition to
                   those set forth in the applicable Bid

                                      -42-

                   Rate Advance Borrowing Notice or arrives after the time set
                   forth above for its receipt by the Agent.

                       (iii) The Borrower shall, in turn, before (A) 1:00 p.m.
                   on the date of such proposed Bid Rate Advance, in the case of
                   an Absolute Rate Auction, and (B) 1:00 p.m. three Business
                   Days before the date of such proposed Bid Rate Advance, in
                   the case of an Indexed Rate Auction, either:

                             (x) cancel such Bid Rate Advance by giving the
                       Agent notice to that effect, or

                             (y) accept one or more of the offers made by any
                       Bank or Banks pursuant to Section 2.9(b), in its sole
                       discretion and subject to Section 2.9(d), by giving
                       notice, in the form of EXHIBIT D-4 attached hereto, to
                       the Agent of the amount of each Bid Rate Loan to be made
                       by each Bank as part of such Bid Rate Advance, and reject
                       any remaining offers made by Banks pursuant to Section
                       2.9(b)(ii) by giving the Agent notice to that effect.

                       (iv)  If the Borrower notifies the Agent that such Bid
                   Rate Advance is canceled pursuant to Section 2.9(b)(iii)(x)
                   above, the Agent shall give prompt notice thereof to the
                   Banks and such Bid Rate Advance shall not be made.

                       (v)   If the Borrower accepts one or more of the offers
                   made by any Bank or Banks pursuant to Section 2.9(b)(iii)(y),
                   the Agent shall in turn promptly notify (A) each Bank that
                   has made an offer as described in Section 2.9(b)(ii) of the
                   date, and aggregate amount of such Bid Rate Advance and
                   whether or not any offer or offers made by such Bank pursuant
                   to Section 2.9(b)(ii) have been accepted by the Borrower and
                   (B) each Bank that is to make a Bid Rate Loan as part of such
                   Bid Rate Advance, of the amount of each Bid Rate Loan to be
                   made by such Bank as part of such Bid Rate Advance. Each Bank
                   that is to make a Bid Rate Loan as part of such Bid Rate
                   Advance shall, not later than the specified remittance time
                   (as set forth in the notice received from the Agent pursuant
                   to clause (B) of the preceding sentence) on the date of such
                   Bid Rate Advance specified in the notice received from the
                   Agent pursuant to clause (B) of the preceding sentence, make
                   available to the Agent such Bank's portion of such Bid Rate
                   Advance, in same day funds. After receipt by the Agent of
                   such funds and provided that the conditions in Section 13 are
                   satisfied and the Borrower has delivered to the Agent the
                   certificate referred to in Section 2.4(iv)(c) as if all
                   references in Section 2.4(iv)(c) to Revolving Credit Loans
                   were to Bid Rate Loans, the Agent will make such funds
                   available to the

                                      -43-
<Page>

                   Borrower upon execution and delivery to the applicable Bank
                   (with a copy to the Agent) by the Borrower of a Bid Rate Note
                   evidencing such Bid Rate Loan (and the provisions set forth
                   in the last two sentences of Section 2.2 relating to
                   Revolving Credit Notes shall apply equally to the Bid Rate
                   Notes). Promptly after each Bid Rate Advance the Agent will
                   notify each Bank of the Bid Rate Advance.

                       (vi)  If the Borrower accepts one or more of the offers
                   made by any Bank or Banks pursuant to Section 2.9(b)(iii)(y)
                   and fails to borrow any Bid Rate Loan so accepted, the
                   Borrower shall indemnify the Bank funding such Loan against
                   any loss or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or
                   reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by such Bank
                   to fund or maintain such unborrowed Bid Rate Loans,
                   including, without limitation, Eurodollar Breakage Costs or
                   other compensation as provided in Section 5.8.

                       (vii) A Bid Rate Advance fee of $750.00 shall be payable
                   by the Borrower to the Agent, for the account of the Agent,
                   with respect to and concurrently with the delivery of each
                   Bid Rate Advance Borrowing Notice.

                   (c) Each Bid Rate Advance shall be in an aggregate amount not
less than $5,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof,
and, following the making of each Bid Rate Advance, the Borrower shall be in
compliance with the limitation set forth in the proviso to Section 2.9(a).

                   (d) Each acceptance by the Borrower pursuant to Section
2.9(b)(iii)(y) of the offers made in response to a Bid Rate Advance Borrowing
Notice shall be treated as an acceptance of such offers in ascending order of
the rates or margins, as applicable, at which the same were made but if, as a
result thereof, two or more offers at the same such rate or margin would be
partially accepted, then the amounts of the Bid Rate Loans in respect of which
such offers are accepted shall be treated as being the amounts which bear the
same proportion to one another as the respective amounts of the Bid Rate Loans
so offered bear to one another but, in each case, rounded as the Agent may
consider necessary to ensure that the amount of each such Bid Rate Loan is
$5,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof.

                   (e) Within the limits and on the conditions set forth in this
Section 2.9, the Borrower may from time to time borrow under this Section 2.9,
repay pursuant to Section 2.9(f), and reborrow under this Section 2.9.

                   (f) The Borrower hereby absolutely and unconditionally
promises to pay to the Agent for the account of each Bank which has made a Bid
Rate Loan to it, on the maturity date of such Bid Rate Loan (such maturity date
being that specified by the

                                      -44-
<Page>

Borrower for repayment of such Bid Rate Loan in the related Bid Rate Advance
Borrowing Notice) or such earlier date to which the maturity of such Bid Rate
Loan has been accelerated hereunder, the then unpaid principal amount of such
Bid Rate Loan and all accrued but unpaid interest thereon. The Borrower shall
have no right to prepay any principal amount of any Bid Rate Loan unless, and
then only on the terms, specified by the Borrower for such Bid Rate Loan in the
related Bid Rate Advance Borrowing Notice and subject to payment of Eurodollar
Breakage Costs and Section 5.8.

                   (g) The Borrower shall, and hereby absolutely and
unconditionally promises to, pay interest on the unpaid principal amount of each
Bid Rate Loan made to it, from the date of such Bid Rate Loan to the date the
principal amount of such Bid Rate Loan is repaid in full, at the rate of
interest for such Bid Rate Loan specified by the Bank making such Bid Rate Loan
in the related notice submitted by such Bank pursuant to Section 2.9(b)(ii),
payable on the interest payment date or dates specified by the Borrower for such
Bid Rate Loan in the related Bid Rate Advance Borrowing Notice and on any date
on which such Bid Rate Loan is prepaid, whether by acceleration or otherwise,
and at maturity. In the event the term of any Bid Rate Loan shall be longer than
three months, interest thereon shall be payable not less frequently than once
each three-month period during such term. Interest on Bid Rate Loans shall be
calculated for actual days elapsed on the basis of a 360-day year.

    Section 2.10.  INCREASES IN TOTAL COMMITMENT. The Borrower shall have the
right to cause the Total Commitment to increase by an amount not at any time
exceeding $200,000,000 (the "Increase"), in which event the Agent will amend
SCHEDULE 2 to reflect the increased Commitment of each Bank, if any, that has
agreed in writing to an increase and to add any third party financial
institution that may have become a party to, and a "Bank" under, this Agreement
in connection with the Increase; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that it shall be a condition
precedent to the effectiveness of the Increase that the Increase Conditions
shall have been satisfied. In the event that the Increase results in any change
to the Commitment Percentage of any Bank, then on the effective date of such
Increase in the Total Commitment (i) any new Bank, and any existing Bank whose
Commitment has increased, shall pay to the Agent such amounts as are necessary
to fund its new or increased Commitment Percentage of all existing Revolving
Credit Loans, (ii) the Agent will use the proceeds thereof to pay to all Banks
whose Commitment Percentage is decreasing such amounts as are necessary so that
each such Bank's participation in existing Revolving Credit Loans will be equal
to its adjusted Commitment Percentage, and (iii) if the effective date of such
Increase in the Total Commitment occurs on a date other than the last day of an
Interest Period applicable to any outstanding Eurodollar Rate Loan, the Borrower
will be responsible for Eurodollar Breakage Costs and any other amounts payable
pursuant to Section 5.8 on account of the payments made pursuant to clause (ii)
above.

    Section 2.11.  EXTENSION OF REVOLVING CREDIT MATURITY DATE. At least 30 days
but in no event more than 90 days prior to January 17, 2006, the Borrower, by
written notice to the Agent (with copies for each Bank), may request an
extension of the Maturity Date by a period of one year from the Maturity Date
then in effect (the "Extension"). The Extension shall become effective on
January 17, 2006 so long as (i) the Borrower has paid to the Agent on such date,
for the ratable accounts of the Banks, an extension fee in an amount equal to 20
basis points on the Total Commitment in effect on such date, and (ii) no Default
or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing on such date and all
representations and warranties contained in the Loan Documents shall be true and
correct as of such date (except (i) to the extent of changes resulting from
transactions contemplated or not prohibited by this Agreement or the other Loan
Documents (including, without limitation, the fact that a Real Estate Asset may
cease to be a Borrowing Base Property pursuant to the terms of this Agreement)
and changes occurring in the ordinary course of business, (ii) to the extent
that such representations and warranties relate expressly to an earlier date and
(iii) to the extent otherwise represented by the Borrower with respect to the
representation set forth in Section 7.10). The notice referred to in the first
sentence of this Section 2.11 shall constitute and shall be deemed to be a
certification by the Borrower as to the truth and accuracy of the statements
contained in clause (ii) of the preceding sentence.

    Section 3.     LETTERS OF CREDIT.

    Section 3.1.   LETTER OF CREDIT COMMITMENTS.

                   Section 3.1.1. COMMITMENT TO ISSUE LETTERS OF CREDIT. Subject
to the terms and conditions hereof and the execution and delivery by the
Borrower of a letter of credit application on the Fronting Bank's customary form
as part of a Completed Loan Request (a "Letter of Credit Application"), the
Fronting Bank on behalf of the Banks and in reliance upon the agreement of the
Banks set forth in Section 3.1.4 and upon the representations and warranties of
the Borrower contained herein, agrees, in its individual capacity, to issue,
extend and renew for the account of the Borrower one or more letters of credit
(individually, a "Letter of Credit"), in such form as may be requested from time
to time by the Borrower and reasonably agreed to by the Fronting Bank; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that, after giving effect to such Completed Loan Request, (a) the
Maximum Drawing Amount plus all Reimbursement Obligations (to the extent, if
any, not yet deemed a Revolving Credit Loan pursuant to Section 3.3), shall not
exceed $100,000,000 at any one time and (b) the sum of (i) the Maximum Drawing
Amount and, without double counting, all Reimbursement Obligations (to the
extent, if any, not yet deemed a Revolving Credit Loan pursuant to Section 3.3)
and (ii) the amount of all Loans (including Swingline Loans and Bid Rate Loans)
outstanding shall not exceed the lesser of (x) the Total Commitment in effect at
such time and (y) the Borrowing Base Availability at such time.

                   Section 3.1.2. LETTER OF CREDIT APPLICATIONS. Each Letter of
Credit Application shall be completed to the reasonable satisfaction of the
Agent and the Fronting Bank. In

                                      -46-
<Page>

the event that any provision of any Letter of Credit Application shall be
inconsistent with any provision of this Agreement (including provisions
applicable to a Completed Loan Request) or shall impose additional financial or
other material obligations (other than technical, administrative and ministerial
obligations, whether relating to the mechanics of a draw under a Letter of
Credit or otherwise), then the provisions of this Agreement shall, to the extent
of any such inconsistency or additional material obligation, govern.

                   Section 3.1.3. TERMS OF LETTERS OF CREDIT. Each Letter of
Credit issued, extended or renewed hereunder shall, among other things, (i)
provide for the payment of sight drafts for honor thereunder when presented in
accordance with the terms thereof and when accompanied by the documents
described therein, and (ii) have an expiry date no later than the date which is
fourteen (14) days prior to the Maturity Date. Each Letter of Credit so issued,
extended or renewed shall be subject to the Uniform Customs.

                   Section 3.1.4. OBLIGATIONS OF BANKS WITH RESPECT TO LETTERS
OF CREDIT. Each Bank severally agrees that it shall be absolutely liable,
without regard to the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default or any other
condition precedent whatsoever, to the extent of such Bank's Commitment
Percentage, to reimburse the Fronting Bank on demand pursuant to Section 3.3 for
the amount of each draft paid by the Fronting Bank under each Letter of Credit
to the extent that such amount is not reimbursed by the Borrower pursuant to
Section 3.2 (such agreement for a Bank being called herein the "Letter of Credit
Participation" of such Bank). Each such payment made by a Bank shall be treated
as a purchase by such Bank of a participation in the Fronting Bank's interest in
such Letter of Credit and each Bank shall share, in accordance with its
respective Commitment Percentage, in any interest which accrues and is payable
by the Borrower pursuant to Section 3.2 or otherwise in connection with such
Letter of Credit.

                   Section 3.1.5. FRONTING BANK. Notwithstanding the definition
of Fronting Bank, in the event that the Borrower reasonably determines that it
would be beneficial to have a Letter of Credit issued by a Bank with a higher
rating than Fleet has at any applicable time of reference (as determined by
Moody's or S&P), or for any other reason acceptable to the Agent, the Borrower
shall have the right to elect any Bank having a higher rating than Fleet (or
such other applicable Bank) as the Fronting Bank for that particular Letter of
Credit, PROVIDED that no Bank other than Fleet shall be required to be a
Fronting Bank.

    Section 3.2.   REIMBURSEMENT OBLIGATION OF THE BORROWER. In order to induce
the Fronting Bank to issue, extend and renew each Letter of Credit and the Banks
to participate therein, the Borrower hereby agrees, except as contemplated in
Section 3.3, to reimburse or pay to the Fronting Bank, for the account of the
Fronting Bank or (as the case may be) the Banks, with respect to each Letter of
Credit issued, extended or renewed by the Fronting Bank hereunder,

                   (a) except as otherwise expressly provided in Section 3.2(b)
and (c) or Section 3.3, promptly upon notification by the Fronting Bank or the
Agent that any draft presented

                                      -47-
<Page>

under such Letter of Credit is honored by the Fronting Bank, or the Fronting
Bank otherwise makes a payment with respect thereto, (i) the amount paid by the
Fronting Bank under or with respect to such Letter of Credit, and (ii) any
amounts payable pursuant to Section 5.5 under, or with respect to, such Letter
of Credit,

                   (b) upon the reduction (but not termination) of the Total
Commitment to an amount less than the then Maximum Drawing Amount (after taking
into account all outstanding Loans and Reimbursement Obligations, if any
(without double counting)), an amount equal to such difference, which amount
shall be held by the Agent in an interest-bearing account (with interest to be
added to such account) as cash collateral for the benefit of the Banks and the
Agent for all Reimbursement Obligations, and

                   (c) upon the termination of the Total Commitment, or the
acceleration of the Reimbursement Obligations with respect to all Letters of
Credit in accordance with Section 14, an amount equal to the then Maximum
Drawing Amount on all Letters of Credit, which amount shall be held by the Agent
in an interest-bearing account (with interest to be added to such account) as
cash collateral for the benefit of the Banks and the Agent for all Reimbursement
Obligations.

    Each such payment shall be made to the Agent for the benefit of the Banks at
the Agent's Head Office in immediately available funds. Interest on any and all
amounts not converted to a Revolving Credit Loan pursuant to Section 3.3 and
remaining unpaid by the Borrower under this Section 3.2 at any time from the
date such amounts become due and payable (whether as stated in this Section 3.2,
by acceleration or otherwise) until payment in full (whether before or after
judgment) shall be payable to the Agent for the benefit of the Banks on demand
at the rate specified in Section 5.9 for overdue principal on the Loans.

    Section 3.3.   LETTER OF CREDIT PAYMENTS; FUNDING OF A LOAN. If any draft
shall be presented or other demand for payment shall be made under any Letter of
Credit, the Fronting Bank will use its best efforts to notify the Borrower and
the Banks, on or before the date the Fronting Bank intends to honor such
drawing, of the date and amount of the draft presented or demand for payment and
of the date and time when it expects to pay such draft or honor such demand for
payment and, except to the extent the amount of such draft becomes a Revolving
Credit Loan as set forth in this Section 3.3, Borrower shall reimburse Agent, as
set forth in Section 3.2. Notwithstanding anything contained in Section 3.2 or
this Section 3.3 to the contrary, however, unless Borrower shall have notified
the Agent and Fronting Bank prior to 11:00 a.m. (New York time) on the Business
Day immediately prior to the date of such drawing that Borrower intends to
reimburse Fronting Bank for the amount of such drawing with funds other than the
proceeds of Revolving Credit Loans, Borrower shall be deemed to have timely
given a Completed Loan Request pursuant to Section 2.4 to Agent, requesting a
Prime Rate Loan on the date on which such drawing is honored and in an amount
equal to the amount of such drawing. The Borrower may thereafter convert any
such Prime Rate Loan to a Revolving Credit Loan of another Type in accordance
with Section 2.5. Each Bank shall, in accordance with Section 2.6, make
available such Bank's

                                      -48-
<Page>

Commitment Percentage of such Revolving Credit Loan to Agent, the proceeds of
which shall be applied directly by Agent to reimburse Fronting Bank for the
amount of such draw. In the event that any Bank fails to make available to Agent
the amount of such Bank's Commitment Percentage of such Revolving Credit Loan on
the date of any drawing, Agent shall be entitled to recover such amount on
demand from such Bank plus any additional amounts payable under Section 2.6(b)
in the event of a late funding by a Bank. The Fronting Bank is irrevocably
authorized by the Borrower and each of the Banks to honor draws on each Letter
of Credit by the beneficiary thereof in accordance with the terms of such Letter
of Credit. The responsibility of the Agent to the Borrower and the Banks shall
be only to determine that the documents (including each draft) delivered under
each Letter of Credit in connection with such presentment shall be in conformity
in all material respects with such Letter of Credit.

    Section 3.4.   OBLIGATIONS ABSOLUTE. The Borrower's obligations under this
Section 3 shall be absolute and unconditional under any and all circumstances
and irrespective of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default or any
condition precedent whatsoever or any setoff, counterclaim or defense to payment
which the Borrower may have or have had against the Agent, any Bank or any
beneficiary of a Letter of Credit. The Borrower further agrees with the Agent
and the Banks that the Agent and the Banks shall not be responsible for, and the
Borrower's Reimbursement Obligations under Section 3.2 shall not be affected by,
among other things, the validity or genuineness of documents or of any
endorsements thereon (so long as the documents delivered under each Letter of
Credit in connection with such presentment shall be in the form required by, and
in conformity in all material respects with, such Letter of Credit), even if
such documents should in fact prove to be in any or all respects invalid,
fraudulent or forged, or any dispute between or among the Borrower, the
beneficiary of any Letter of Credit or any financing institution or other party
to whom any Letter of Credit may be transferred, or any claims or defenses
whatsoever of the Borrower against the beneficiary of any Letter of Credit or
any such transferee. The Agent and the Banks shall not be liable for any error,
omission, interruption or delay in transmission, dispatch or delivery of any
message or advice, however transmitted, in connection with any Letter of Credit.
The Borrower agrees that any action taken or omitted by the Agent or any Bank
under or in connection with each Letter of Credit and the related drafts and
documents, if done in good faith and absent gross negligence, shall be binding
upon the Borrower and shall not result in any liability on the part of the Agent
or any Bank to the Borrower.

telegram, telecopy, telex or teletype message, statement, order or other
document believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent
or made by the proper Person or Persons and upon advice and statements of legal

Application and otherwise in accordance with the terms of this Agreement) unless
it shall first have received such advice or concurrence of the Majority Banks
(or such other number or percentage of the Banks as may be required by this
Agreement) as it reasonably deems appropriate or it shall first be indemnified
to its reasonable satisfaction by the Banks against any and all liability and
expense which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take
any such action. The Agent and any Fronting Bank shall in all cases be fully
protected by the Banks in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this
Section 3 in accordance with a request of the Majority Banks(or such other
number or percentage of the Banks as may be required by this Agreement), and
such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be
binding upon the Banks and all future holders of the Notes or of a Letter of
Credit Participation.

    Section 3.6.   LETTER OF CREDIT FEE. The Borrower shall pay to the Agent a
fee (in each case, a "Letter of Credit Fee") in an amount equal to the
Applicable L/C Percentage of the undrawn amount of each outstanding Letter of

each calendar quarter for the immediately preceding calendar quarter, with a
final payment on the Maturity Date or any earlier date on which the Commitments

quarter in which such Letter of Credit is issued, drawn upon or otherwise
reduced or terminated) and (b) shall be for the accounts of the Banks as
follows: (i) an amount equal to 0.125% per annum of the Letter of Credit Fee
shall be for the account of the Fronting Bank and (ii) the remainder of the
Letter of Credit Fee shall be for the accounts of the Banks (including the

    Section 4.     REPAYMENT OF THE LOANS.

    Section 4.1.   MATURITY. In addition to, and without limiting, the
provisions of Section 2.8(b) and Section 2.9(f), the Borrower promises to pay on
the Maturity Date, and there shall become absolutely due and payable on the
Maturity Date, all unpaid principal of the Revolving Credit Loans and each other
Loan, if any, outstanding on such date, together with any and all accrued and
unpaid interest thereon, the unpaid balance of the Facility Fee accrued through
such date, and any and all other unpaid amounts due under this Agreement, the
Notes or any other of the Loan Documents.

    Section 4.2.   OPTIONAL REPAYMENTS OF REVOLVING CREDIT LOANS. The Borrower
shall have the right, at its election, to prepay the outstanding amount of the
Revolving Credit Loans, in whole or in part, at any time without penalty or
premium; PROVIDED that the outstanding amount of any Eurodollar Rate Loans may
not be prepaid unless the Borrower pays the Eurodollar Breakage Costs for each
Eurodollar Rate Loan so prepaid at the time of such prepayment. The Borrower
shall give the Agent (with copies to the Agent for each Bank), no later than
10:00 a.m., Boston, Massachusetts time, at least two (2) Business Days' prior
written notice of any prepayment pursuant to this Section 4.2 of any

                                      -50-
<Page>

Prime Rate Loans, and at least four (4) Eurodollar Business Days' notice of any
proposed prepayment pursuant to this Section 4.2 of Eurodollar Rate Loans,
specifying the proposed date of prepayment of Revolving Credit Loans and the
principal amount to be prepaid. Each such partial prepayment of the Loans shall
be in an amount equal to $500,000 or an integral multiple of $100,000 in excess
thereof or, if less, the outstanding balance of the Revolving Credit Loans then
being repaid, shall be accompanied by the payment of all charges, if any,
outstanding on all Revolving Credit Loans so prepaid and of all accrued interest
on the principal prepaid to the date of payment, and shall be applied, in the
absence of instruction by the Borrower, first to the principal of Prime Rate
Loans and then to the principal of Eurodollar Rate Loans.

    Section 4.3    MANDATORY REPAYMENT OF LOANS. If at any time the sum of the
outstanding amount of the Loans, PLUS the Maximum Drawing Amount, PLUS without
double-counting any Revolving Credit Loans, the outstanding Reimbursement
Obligations, if any, exceeds the lesser of (i) the Total Commitment at such
time, or (ii) the Borrowing Base Availability at such time, the Borrower shall,
within fifteen (15) days after receiving notice of such excess from the Agent
(i) pay to the Agent an amount in cash necessary to eliminate such excess, such
amount to be applied, in the absence of instruction by the Borrower, (x) first
to the repayment of Swingline Loans, second to the repayment of Revolving Credit
Loans and third to the repayment of Bid Rate Loans and (y) with respect to any
such payments of Revolving Credit Loans, first to the principal of Prime Rate
Loans and then to the principal of Eurodollar Rate Loans, or (ii) add one (1) or
more Real Estate Assets to the Borrowing Base which have Borrowing Base Values,
in the aggregate, sufficient to eliminate such excess.

    Section 5.     CERTAIN GENERAL PROVISIONS.

    Section 5.1.   FUNDS FOR PAYMENTS.

                   (a) All payments of principal, interest, fees, and any other
amounts due hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents shall be made to
the Agent, for the respective accounts of the Banks or (as the case may be) the
Agent, at the Agent's Head Office, in each case in Dollars and in immediately
available funds. The Borrower shall make each payment of principal of and
interest on the Loans and of fees hereunder and Reimbursement Obligations which
are not converted to a Loan hereunder not later than 1:00 p.m. (Boston,
Massachusetts time) on the due date thereof.

                   (b) All payments by the Borrower hereunder and under any of
the other Loan Documents shall be made without setoff or counterclaim and free
and clear of and without deduction for any taxes, levies, imposts, duties,
charges, fees, deductions, withholdings, compulsory liens, restrictions or
conditions of any nature now or hereafter imposed or levied by any jurisdiction
or any political subdivision thereof or taxing or other authority therein unless
the Borrower is compelled by law to make such deduction or withholding. If the
Borrower is compelled by law to make any such deduction or

                                      -51-
<Page>

withholding with respect to any amount payable by it hereunder or under any of
the other Loan Documents (except with respect to taxes on the income or profits
of the Agent or any Bank), the Borrower shall pay to the Agent, for the account
of the Banks or (as the case may be) the Agent, on the date on which such amount
is due and payable hereunder or under such other Loan Document, such additional
amount in Dollars as shall be necessary to enable the Banks to receive the same
net amount which the Banks would have received on such due date had no such
obligation been imposed upon the Borrower. The Borrower will deliver promptly to
the Agent (with copies to the Agent for each Bank) certificates or other valid
vouchers for all taxes or other charges deducted from or paid with respect to
payments made by the Borrower hereunder or under such other Loan Document.

    Section 5.2.   COMPUTATIONS. All computations of interest on the Loans and
of other fees to the extent applicable shall be based on a 360-day year and paid
for the actual number of days elapsed. Except as otherwise provided in the
definition of the term "Interest Period" with respect to Eurodollar Rate Loans,
whenever a payment hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents becomes
due on a day that is not a Business Day, the due date for such payment shall be
extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and interest shall accrue during
such extension. The outstanding amount of the Loans as reflected on the Note
Records or record attached to any other Note from time to time shall constitute
prima facie evidence of the principal amount thereof.

    Section 5.3.   INABILITY TO DETERMINE EURODOLLAR RATE. In the event, prior
to the commencement of any Interest Period relating to any Eurodollar Rate Loan,
the Agent shall reasonably and in good faith determine that adequate and
reasonable methods do not exist for ascertaining the Eurodollar Rate that would
otherwise determine the rate of interest to be applicable to any Eurodollar Rate
Loan during any Interest Period, the Agent shall forthwith give notice of such
determination (which shall be conclusive and binding on the Borrower) to the
Borrower and the Banks. In such event (a) any Loan Request with respect to
Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be automatically withdrawn and shall be deemed a
request for Prime Rate Loans, (b) each Eurodollar Rate Loan will automatically,
on the last day of the then current Interest Period applicable thereto, become a
Prime Rate Loan, and (c) the obligations of the Banks to make Eurodollar Rate
Loans shall be suspended, in each case unless and until the Agent reasonably and
in good faith determines that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension
no longer exist, whereupon the Agent shall so notify the Borrower and the Banks.

    Section 5.4.   ILLEGALITY. Notwithstanding any other provisions herein, if
any present or future law, regulation, treaty or directive or in the
interpretation or application thereof shall make it unlawful for any Bank to
make or maintain Eurodollar Rate Loans, such Bank shall forthwith give notice of
such circumstances to the Borrower and thereupon (a) the Commitment of such Bank
to make Eurodollar Rate Loans or convert Prime Rate Loans to Eurodollar Rate
Loans shall forthwith be suspended and (b) such Bank's Commitment Percentage of
Eurodollar Rate Loans then outstanding shall be converted

                                      -52-
<Page>

automatically to Prime Rate Loans on the last day of each Interest Period
applicable to such Eurodollar Rate Loans or within such earlier period as may be
required by law, all until such time as it is no longer unlawful for such Bank
to make or maintain Eurodollar Rate Loans. Subject to the limitations set forth
in Section 5.7, the Borrower hereby agrees promptly to pay the Agent for the
account of such Bank, upon demand, any additional amounts necessary to
compensate such Bank for any costs incurred by such Bank in making any
conversion required by this Section 5.4 prior to the last day of an Interest
Period with respect to a Eurodollar Rate Loan, including any interest or fees
payable by such Bank to lenders of funds obtained by it in order to make or
maintain its Eurodollar Rate Loans hereunder.

    Section 5.5.   ADDITIONAL COSTS, ETC. If any present or future applicable
law, which expression, as used herein, includes statutes, rules and regulations
thereunder and interpretations thereof by any competent court or by any
governmental or other regulatory body or official charged with the
administration or the interpretation thereof and requests, directives,
instructions and notices at any time or from time to time hereafter made upon or
otherwise issued to any Bank or the Agent by any central bank or other fiscal,
monetary or other authority (whether or not having the force of law, but if not
having the force of law, then generally applied by the Banks or the Agent with
respect to similar loans), shall:

                   (a) subject any Bank or the Agent to any tax, levy, impost,
duty, charge, fee, deduction or withholding of any nature with respect to this
Agreement, the other Loan Documents, any Letters of Credit, such Bank's
Commitment or the Loans (other than taxes based upon or measured by the income
or profits of such Bank or the Agent), or

                   (b) materially change the basis of taxation (except for
changes in taxes on income or profits) of payments to any Bank of the principal
of or the interest on any Loans or any other amounts payable to the Agent or any
Bank under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, or

                   (c) impose or increase or render applicable (other than to
the extent specifically provided for elsewhere in this Agreement) any special
deposit, reserve, assessment, liquidity, capital adequacy or other similar
requirements (whether or not having the force of law) against assets held by, or
deposits in or for the account of, or loans by, or letters of credit issued by,
or commitments of an office of any Bank, or

                   (d) impose on any Bank or the Agent any other conditions or
requirements with respect to this Agreement, the other Loan Documents, any
Letters of Credit, the Loans, such Bank's Commitment, or any class of loans,
letters of credit or commitments of which any of the Loans or such Bank's
Commitment forms a part;

and the result of any of the foregoing is

                                      -53-
<Page>

                       (i)   to increase the cost to any Bank of making,
                   funding, issuing, renewing, extending or maintaining any of
                   the Loans or such Bank's Commitment or any Letter of Credit,
                   or

                       (ii)  to reduce the amount of principal, interest,
                   Reimbursement Obligation or other amount payable to such Bank
                   or the Agent hereunder on account of such Bank's Commitment,
                   any Letter of Credit or any of the Loans, or

                       (iii) to require such Bank or the Agent to make any
                   payment or to forego any interest or Reimbursement Obligation
                   or other sum payable hereunder, the amount of which payment
                   or foregone interest or Reimbursement Obligation or other sum
                   is calculated by reference to the gross amount of any sum
                   receivable or deemed received by such Bank or the Agent from
                   the Borrower hereunder,

then, and in each such case, the Borrower will, within thirty (30) days after
notice by the Agent or such Bank (such notice to be given promptly by the Agent
or such Bank upon the making of any such determination), at any time and from
time to time and as often as the occasion therefor may arise, but subject to the
limitations set forth in Section 5.7, pay to such Bank or the Agent such
additional amounts as such Bank or the Agent shall determine in good faith to be
sufficient to compensate such Bank or the Agent for such additional cost,
reduction, payment or foregone interest or other sum, PROVIDED that such Bank or
the Agent is generally imposing similar charges on its other similarly situated
borrowers.

    Section 5.6.   CAPITAL ADEQUACY. If any future law, governmental rule,
regulation, policy, guideline or directive (whether or not having the force of
law, but if not having the force of law, then generally applied by the Banks
with respect to similar loans) or the interpretation thereof by a court or
governmental authority with appropriate jurisdiction affects the amount of
capital required or expected to be maintained by banks or bank holding companies
and any Bank or the Agent determines that the amount of capital required to be
maintained by it is increased by or based upon the existence of Loans made or
deemed to be made pursuant hereto, then such Bank or the Agent may notify the
Borrower of such fact, and the Borrower shall pay to such Bank or the Agent from
time to time, within thirty (30) days after notice by the Agent or such Bank
(such notice to be given promptly by the Agent or such Bank upon the making of
any such determination), as an additional fee payable hereunder, but subject to
the limitations set forth in Section 5.7, such amount as such Bank or the Agent
shall determine reasonably and in good faith and certify in a notice to the
Borrower to. be an amount that will adequately compensate such Bank in light of
these circumstances for its increased costs of maintaining such capital. Each
Bank and the Agent shall allocate such cost increases among its customers in
good faith and on an equitable basis, and will not charge the Borrower unless it
is generally imposing a similar charge on its other similarly situated
borrowers.

                                      -54-
<Page>

    Section 5.7.   CERTIFICATE; LIMITATIONS. A certificate setting forth any
additional amounts payable pursuant to Section Section 5.5 or 5.6 and a brief
explanation of such amounts which are due, including reasonably detailed
information regarding the method and calculation of such amount, submitted by
any Bank or the Agent to the Borrower, shall be PRIMA FACIE evidence that such
amounts are due and owing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Article 5, (i) to the extent reasonably possible, each Bank shall designate
an alternate lending office in the continental United States to make the Loans
in order to reduce any liability of Borrower to such Bank under Section Section
5.4, 5.5 or 5.6 or to avoid the unavailability of a Eurodollar Rate Loan, so
long as such designation is not disadvantageous to such Bank, and (ii) the
Borrower shall not be obligated to compensate any Bank pursuant to Section
Section 5.4, 5.5 or 5.6 for any amounts attributable to any period which is more
than one (1) year prior to the date of delivery of the certificate set forth in
the first sentence of this Section 5.7.

    Section 5.8.   INDEMNITY. In addition to the other provisions of this
Agreement regarding such matters, the Borrower agrees to indemnify the Agent and
each Bank and to hold the Agent and each Bank harmless from and against any
loss, cost or expense (including loss of the spread to which such Bank would
have been entitled through the end of the applicable Interest Period in excess
of the applicable interest rate(s) then in effect) that the Agent or such Bank
may sustain or incur as a consequence of (a) a default by the Borrower in the
payment of any principal amount of or any interest on any Eurodollar Rate Loans
as and when due and payable, including any such loss or expense arising from
interest or fees payable by the Agent or such Bank to lenders of funds obtained
by it in order to maintain its Eurodollar Rate Loans, (b) the failure by the
Borrower to make a borrowing or conversion after the Borrower has given a
Completed Loan Request for a Eurodollar Rate Loan or a Conversion Request for a
Eurodollar Rate Loan, and (c) the making of any payment of a Eurodollar Rate
Loan or the making of any conversion of any such Loan to a Prime Rate Loan on a
day that is not the last day of the applicable Interest Period with respect
thereto, including interest or fees payable by the Agent or a Bank to lenders of
funds obtained by it in order to maintain any such Eurodollar Rate Loans;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Borrower shall not be required to so indemnify any
Bank pursuant to clause (b) above during and for any period of time when such
Bank has wrongfully failed or refused to fund its proportionate share of a Loan
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and is a Delinquent Bank.

    Section 5.9.   INTEREST ON OVERDUE AMOUNTS. Overdue principal and (to the
extent permitted by applicable law) interest on the Loans and all other overdue
amounts payable hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents shall bear
interest payable on demand at a rate per annum equal to three percent (3%) PLUS
the Prime Rate until such amount shall be paid in full (after as well as before
judgment). In addition, the Borrower shall pay a late charge equal to three
percent (3%) of any amount of interest charges on the Loans which is not paid
within ten (10) days of the date when due.

                                      -55-
<Page>

    Section 6.     RECOURSE OBLIGATIONS. The Obligations are full recourse
obligations of the Borrower, and all of the respective assets and properties of
the Borrower shall be available for the payment in full in cash and performance
of the Obligations. In no event shall BPI have any personal liability hereunder
or under any of the other Loan Documents, either individually or as general
partner of BPLP or any other Borrower, by application of applicable law or
otherwise, except to the extent BPI misappropriates funds, rents or insurance
proceeds or engages in gross negligence, willful misconduct or fraud.

    Section 7.     REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. The Borrower for itself and
for BPI insofar as any such statements relate to BPI represents and warrants to
the Banks all of the statements contained in this Section 7.

    Section 7.1.   AUTHORITY, ETC.

                   (a) ORGANIZATION: GOOD STANDING.

                            (i)  The Borrower is a limited partnership, general
                       partnership, nominee trust or limited liability company,
                       as the case may be, duly organized, validly existing and
                       in good standing under the laws of its state of
                       organization, unless the failure to be so does not relate
                       to BPLP or BPI and is a Non-Material Breach; the Borrower
                       has all requisite limited partnership, general
                       partnership, trust, limited liability company or
                       corporate, as the case may be, power to own its
                       respective properties and conduct its respective business
                       as now conducted and as presently contemplated, unless
                       any such failure to have any of the foregoing does not
                       relate to BPLP or BPI and is a Non-Material Breach; and
                       the Borrower is in good standing as a foreign entity and
                       is duly authorized to do business in the jurisdictions
                       where the Borrowing Base Properties owned or
                       ground-leased by it are located and in each other
                       jurisdiction where such qualification is necessary except
                       where a failure to be so qualified in such other
                       jurisdiction would not have a materially adverse effect
                       on any of their respective businesses, assets or
                       financial conditions.

                            (ii) BPI is a corporation duly organized, validly
                       existing and in good standing under the laws of the State
                       of Delaware; each Subsidiary of BPI is duly organized,
                       validly existing and in good standing as a corporation,
                       nominee trust, limited liability company, limited
                       partnership or general partnership, as the case may be,
                       under the laws of the state of its organization, unless
                       the failure to be so does not relate to BPLP and is a
                       Non-Material Breach; BPI and each of its Subsidiaries has
                       all requisite corporate, trust,

                                      -56-
<Page>

                       limited liability company, limited partnership or general
                       partnership, as the case may be, power to own its
                       respective properties and conduct its respective business
                       as now conducted and as presently contemplated, unless
                       any such failure to have any of the foregoing does not
                       relate to BPLP or BPI and is a Non-Material Breach; and
                       BPI is in good standing as a foreign entity and is duly
                       authorized to do business in the jurisdictions where such
                       qualification is necessary (including in the Commonwealth
                       of Massachusetts) except where a failure to be so
                       qualified in such other would not have a materially
                       adverse effect on the business, assets or financial
                       condition of BPI.

                   (b) CAPITALIZATION. The outstanding equity of BPLP is
comprised of a general partner interest and limited partner interests, all of
which have been duly issued and are outstanding and fully paid and
non-assessable. All of the issued and outstanding general partner interests of
the BPLP are owned and held of record by BPI. There are no outstanding
securities or agreements exchangeable for or convertible into or carrying any
rights to acquire a general partner interest in BPLP. There are no outstanding
commitments, options, warrants, calls or other agreements (whether written or
oral) binding on BPLP or BPI which require or could require BPLP or BPI to sell,
grant, transfer, assign, mortgage, pledge or otherwise dispose of any general
partner interest in BPLP. Except as set forth in the Agreement of Limited
Partnership of BPLP, no general partner interests of BPLP are subject to any
restrictions on transfer or any partner agreements, voting agreements, trust
deeds, irrevocable proxies; or any other similar agreements or interests
(whether written or oral). For so long as any Borrower which is a Wholly-owned
Subsidiary is a Borrower, BPLP owns, directly or indirectly, at least a majority
(by number of votes or controlling interests) of the outstanding voting
interests and at least 99% of the economic interests in each of the Borrowers
other than BPLP. All of the Preferred Creditor Equity which exists as of the
date of this Agreement, and each of the agreements or other documents entered
into and/or setting forth the terms, rights and restrictions applicable to any
such Preferred Creditor Equity, are listed and described on SCHEDULE 7.1(B)
attached hereto. All of the agreements and other documents relating to the
Preferred Equity in effect on the Closing Date have been furnished to the Agent.

                   (c) DUE AUTHORIZATION. The execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which the Borrower
or BPI is or is to become a party and the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby (i) are within the authority of the Borrower and BPI, (ii) have been

in reasonable detail, prepared in accordance with GAAP, together with a
certification by the principal financial or accounting officer of BPLP that the
information contained in such financial statements fairly presents the financial
position of BPLP on the date thereof (subject to year-end adjustments none of
which shall be materially adverse).

    Section 8.5.   NOTICES.

                   (a) DEFAULTS. The Borrower will, and will cause BPI, as
applicable, to, promptly after obtaining knowledge of the same, notify the Agent
in writing (with copies to the Agent for each Bank) of the occurrence of any
Default or Event of Default or Non-Material Breach. If any Person shall give any
notice or take any other action in respect of (x) a claimed Default (whether or
not constituting an Event of Default) under this Agreement or (y) a claimed
failure by the Borrower, BPI or any of their respective Subsidiaries, as
applicable, to comply with any term, condition or provision of or under any
note, evidence of Indebtedness, indenture or other obligation in excess of
$10,000,000, individually or in the aggregate, to which or with respect to which
any of them is a party or obligor, whether as principal or surety, and such
failure to comply would permit the holder of such note or obligation or other
evidence of Indebtedness to accelerate the maturity thereof, which acceleration
would have a material adverse effect on BPLP, BPI or, taken as a whole, the BP
Group or the Borrower shall forthwith give written notice thereof to the Agent
and each of the Banks, describing the notice or action and the nature of the
claimed failure to comply.

violation (as determined by the Borrower or BPI in the exercise of its
reasonable discretion) of any Environmental Law regarding any Real Estate Asset
or Borrower's or BPI's operations, (ii) upon Borrower's or BPI's obtaining
knowledge of any known Release of any Hazardous Substance at, from, or into any
Real Estate Asset which it reports in writing or is reportable by it in writing
to any governmental authority and which is material in amount or nature or which
could materially affect the value of such Real Estate Asset, (iii) upon
Borrower's or BPI's receipt of any notice of material violation of any
Environmental Laws or of any material Release of Hazardous Substances in
violation of any Environmental Laws or any matter that may be a Disqualifying
Environmental Event with respect to any of the Borrowing Base Properties,
including a notice or claim of liability or potential responsibility from any
third party (including without limitation any federal, state or local
governmental officials) and including notice of any formal inquiry, proceeding,
demand, investigation or other action with regard to (A) Borrower's or BPI's or
any other Person's operation of any Real Estate Asset, (B) contamination on,
from or into any Real Estate Asset, or (C) investigation or remediation of
off-site locations at which Borrower or BPI or any of its predecessors are
alleged to have directly or indirectly disposed of Hazardous Substances, or (iv)
upon Borrower's or BPI's obtaining knowledge that any expense or loss has been
incurred by such governmental authority in connection with the assessment,
containment, removal or remediation of any Hazardous Substances with respect to
which Borrower or BPI or any Partially-Owned Real Estate Entity may be liable or
for which a lien may be imposed on any Real Estate Asset; any of which events
described in clauses (i) through (iv) above would have a material adverse effect
on the business, assets or financial condition of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or constitutes a Disqualifying Environmental
Event with respect to any of the Borrowing Base Properties. As of the date
hereof, the Borrower has notified the Agent and the Banks of the matters
referenced on SCHEDULE 8.5(B), to the extent such matters are disclosed in the
Form 10-K referred to therein.

                   (c) NOTIFICATION OF CLAIMS AGAINST BORROWING BASE PROPERTIES.

aware thereof, notify the Agent in writing (with copies to the Agent for each
Bank) of any setoff, claims, withholdings or other defenses to which any of the
Borrowing Base Properties are subject, which (i) would have a material adverse
effect on (x) the business, assets or financial condition of BPLP, BPI or, taken
as a whole, the BP Group, or (y) the value of any such Borrowing Base Property,
or (ii) with respect to such Borrowing Base Property, constitute a Disqualifying
Environmental Event, a Disqualifying Structural Event or a Lien subject to the
bonding or insurance requirement of Section 9.2(viii).

                   (d) NOTICE OF LITIGATION AND JUDGMENTS. The Borrower will,
and will cause BPI and their respective Subsidiaries, to give notice to the
Agent in writing (with copies to the Agent for each Bank) within fifteen (15)
days of becoming aware of any

                                      -68-
<Page>

litigation or proceedings threatened in writing or any pending litigation and
proceedings an adverse determination in which could materially affect BPLP, BPI
or taken as a whole, the BP Group, or any Borrowing Base Property or to which
the Borrower, BPI or any of their respective Subsidiaries is or is to become a
party involving an uninsured claim against the Borrower, BPI or any of their
respective Subsidiaries that could reasonably be expected to have a materially
adverse effect on BPLP, BPI or, taken as a whole, the BP Group, the respective
properties, business, assets, financial condition or prospects or on the value
or operation of the Borrowing Base Properties and stating the nature and status
of such litigation or proceedings. The Borrower will, and will cause each of BPI
and their respective Subsidiaries to, give notice to the Agent and each of the
Banks, in writing, in form and detail reasonably satisfactory to the Agent and

insurance, final or otherwise, against the Borrower, BPI or any of such
Subsidiaries in an amount in excess of $5,000,000.

notify the Agent (with copies to the Agent for each Bank) in its financial
reports delivered pursuant to Section Section 8.4(a) and (b) of the acquisition
of Real Estate Assets during the applicable quarter by the Borrower or any other
member of the BP Group (other than BPI) (whether or not such acquisition was
made with proceeds of the Loans), which notice shall include, at the Agent's
request, with respect to each such Real Estate Asset, its address, a brief
description and recent photograph, a rent roll summary, a PRO FORMA and historic
(if available) income statement and a summary of the key business terms of such
acquisition, PROVIDED that the failure of the Borrower to provide such notice to
the Agent shall not constitute a Default or Event of Default hereunder.

                   (f) INSOLVENCY EVENTS. The Borrower shall notify the Agent in
writing (with copies to the Agent for each Bank) promptly after the occurrence
of any of the events described in Section 14.1(g) or (h) with respect to any
member of the BP Group other than BPLP and BPI.

    Section 8.6.   EXISTENCE OF BORROWER; MAINTENANCE OF PROPERTIES. The
Borrower will do or cause to be done all things necessary to, and shall,
preserve and keep in full force and effect its respective existence in its
jurisdiction of organization and will do or cause to be done all things
necessary to preserve and keep in full force all of its respective rights and
franchises and those of its respective Subsidiaries each of which in the good
faith judgment of BPLP may be necessary to properly and advantageously conduct
the businesses conducted by it. The Borrower (a) will cause all necessary
repairs, renewals, replacements, betterments and improvements to be made to all
Real Estate Assets owned or controlled by it, all as in the judgment of the
Borrower may be necessary so that the business carried on in connection
therewith may be properly and advantageously conducted at all times, subject to
the terms of the applicable Leases and partnership agreements or other entity
charter documents, and in any event, will keep all of the Real Estate Assets
(for so long as such Real Estate Assets are owned by the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries) in a condition consistent with the Real Estate Assets currently
owned or

                                      -69-
<Page>

controlled by the Borrower or its Subsidiaries, (b) will cause all of its other
properties and those of its Subsidiaries (to the extent controlled by the
Borrower) used or useful in the conduct of its business or the business of its
Subsidiaries to be maintained and kept in good condition, repair and working
order and supplied with all necessary equipment, (c) will not permit BPI to
directly own or lease any Real Estate Asset (except only 100 East Pratt Street,
Baltimore, Maryland so long as all of the economic benefits of such Real Estate
Asset contractually flow to BPLP), and (d) will, and will cause each of its
Subsidiaries to continue to engage primarily in the businesses now conducted by
it and in related businesses, all of the foregoing to the extent necessary to
comply with the other terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in
the case of clauses (a) and (b) above, except to the extent that the failure to
comply with the provisions thereof constitutes a Non-Material Breach.

    Section 8.7.   EXISTENCE OF BPI; MAINTENANCE OF REIT STATUS OF BPI;
MAINTENANCE OF PROPERTIES;. The Borrower will cause BPI to do or cause to be
done all things necessary to preserve and keep in full force and effect BPI's
existence as a Delaware corporation. The Borrower will cause BPI at all times
(i) to maintain its status as a REIT and not to take any action which could lead
to its disqualification as a REIT and (ii) to continue to be listed on a
nationally-recognized stock exchange. Without limitation of Section 9.3(f), the
Borrower will cause BPI not to engage in any business other than the business of
acting as a REIT and serving as the general partner and limited partner of the
Borrower, and as a member, partner or stockholder of Subsidiaries of the
Borrower, including Boston Properties LLC (PROVIDED that BPI's percentage equity
interest in any such Subsidiary shall not exceed 1%), and matters directly
relating thereto, and shall cause BPI to (x) conduct all or substantially all of
its business operations through the Borrower or through subsidiary partnerships
or other entities in which the Borrower owns at least 99% of the economic
interests and (y) own no real property or material personal property other than
(1) through its ownership interests in the Borrower and its Subsidiaries,
including Boston Properties LLC, in compliance with the terms hereof, and (2)
contracts and agreements of the nature described in Schedule 9.1(e). The
Borrower will cause BPI (a) to cause all of its properties and those of its
Subsidiaries used or useful in the conduct of its business or the business of
its Subsidiaries to be maintained and kept in good condition, repair and working
order, and supplied with all necessary equipment, (b) to cause to be made all
necessary repairs, renewals, replacements, betterments and improvements thereof,
all as in the judgment of BPI may be necessary so that the business carried on
in connection therewith may be properly and advantageously conducted at all
times and (c) to cause each of its Subsidiaries to continue to engage primarily
in the businesses now conducted by it and in related businesses, in each case
under clauses (a), (b) and (c) above to the extent, in the good faith judgment
of BPI, necessary to properly and advantageously conduct the businesses being
conducted by it.

    Section 8.8.   INSURANCE. The Borrower will, and will cause BPI to, maintain
with respect to its properties, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to
maintain with financially sound and reputable insurers, insurance with respect
to such properties and its

                                      -70-
<Page>

business against such casualties and contingencies as shall be in accordance
with the general practices of businesses engaged in similar activities in
similar geographic areas and in amounts, containing such terms, in such forms
and for such periods as may be reasonable and prudent, unless any failure to do
so does not relate to BPLP or BPI and is a Non-Material Breach.

    Section 8.9.   TAXES. The Borrower will, and will cause BPI and each of
their respective Subsidiaries to, pay or cause to be paid real estate taxes,
other taxes, assessments and other governmental charges against the Real Estate
Assets before the same become delinquent and will duly pay and discharge, or
cause to be paid and discharged, before the same shall become overdue, all
taxes, assessments and other governmental charges imposed upon its sales and
activities, or any part thereof, or upon the income or profits therefrom, as
well as all claims for labor, materials, or supplies that if unpaid might by law
become a lien or charge upon any of the Real Estate Assets, unless any failure
to do so does not relate to BPLP or BPI and is a Non-Material Breach; PROVIDED
that any such tax, assessment, charge, levy or claim need not be paid if the
validity or amount thereof shall currently be contested in good faith by
appropriate proceedings and if the Borrower or BPI shall have set aside on its
books adequate reserves with respect thereto; and PROVIDED further that the
Borrower or BPI will pay all such taxes, assessments, charges, levies or claims
forthwith prior to the consummation of proceedings to foreclose any lien that
may have attached as security therefor. Promptly upon request by the Agent if
required for bank regulatory compliance purposes or similar bank purposes, the
Borrower will provide evidence of the payment of real estate taxes, other taxes,
assessments and other governmental charges against the Real Estate Assets in the
form of receipted tax bills or other form reasonably acceptable to the Agent, or
evidence of the existence of applicable contests as contemplated herein.

    Section 8.10. INSPECTION OF PROPERTIES AND BOOKS. (a) Subject to the rights
of tenants to limit or prohibit such access, as denoted in the applicable
leases, the Borrower will, and will cause BPI to, permit the Agent or any of the
Banks' other designated representatives upon no less than 24 hours notice (which
notice may be given orally or in writing), to visit and inspect any of the
properties of the Borrower, BPI or any of their respective Subsidiaries to
examine the books of account of the Borrower, BPI and their respective
Subsidiaries (and to make copies thereof and extracts therefrom) and to discuss
the affairs, finances and accounts of the Borrower, BPI and their respective
Subsidiaries with, and to be advised as to the same by, its officers, all at
such reasonable times and intervals as the Agent may reasonably request;
PROVIDED that, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing,
the Borrower shall only be responsible for the costs and expenses incurred by
the Agent in connection with such inspections.

                   (b) The Borrower hereby agrees that each of the Banks and the
Agent (and each of their respective, and their respective affiliates',
employees, officers, directors, agents and advisors (collectively,
"Representatives") is, and has been from the commencement of discussions with
respect to the facility established by the Agreement

                                      -71-
<Page>

(the "Facility"), permitted to disclose to any and all Persons, without
limitation of any kind, the structure and tax aspects (as such terms are used in
Code sections 6011 and 6111) of the Facility, and all materials of any kind
(including opinions or other tax analyses) that are or have been provided to
such Bank or the Agent related to such structure and tax aspects. In this
regard, each of the Banks and the Agent acknowledges and agrees that its
disclosure of the structure or tax aspects of the Facility is not limited in any
way by an express or implied understanding or agreement, oral or written
(whether or not such understanding or agreement is legally binding).
Furthermore, each of the Banks and the Agent acknowledges and agrees that it
does not know or have reason to know that its use or disclosure of information
relating to the structure or tax aspects of the Facility is limited in any other
manner (such as where the Facility is claimed to be proprietary or exclusive)
for the benefit of any other Person. Notwithstanding the foregoing (i) the Banks
and the Agent shall not disclose any materials or information of any kind or
nature whatsoever which are not specifically permitted to be disclosed in
accordance with the terms of this subparagraph (b) and (ii) in the event of any
change, amendment, modification or clarification of Code sections 6011 and/or
6111 (or any other applicable Section) or any Regulations promulgated
thereunder, or the issuance by any Person of any guidance on which the Banks,
the Agent and the Representatives are entitled to rely or are otherwise bound by
(including, by way of example only, private letter rulings), which in any way
limits or restricts what may be disclosed pursuant to the terms of this
paragraph, or otherwise establishes that such Code sections do not, or are not
intended to, apply to loan facilities such as the Facility (or other similar
transactions), the terms of this subparagraph (b) shall be deemed modified
thereby. In this regard, the Banks and the Agent intend that this transaction
will not be a "confidential transaction" under Code sections 6011, 6111 or 6112,
and the regulations promulgated thereunder.

                   (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein
(including, without limitation, the provisions of subparagraph (b) above),
neither the Agent nor any Bank may disclose to any Person any information that
constitutes material non-public information regarding the Borrower or its
securities for purposes of Regulation FD of the Securities and Exchange
Commission or any other federal or state securities laws (it being acknowledged
and agreed that the provisions of this Section 8.10 with respect to such
information are reasonably necessary to comply with said Regulation FD and/or
such other federal and state securities laws) (such information referred to
collectively herein as the "BORROWER INFORMATION"), except that each of the
Agent and each of the Banks may disclose Borrower Information (i) to any other
Bank, (ii) to any other person if reasonably incidental to the administration of
the Loans, (iii) upon the order of any court or administrative agency, (iv) upon
the request or demand of any regulatory agency or authority, (v) which has been
publicly disclosed other than as a result of a disclosure by the Agent or any
Bank which is not permitted by this Agreement, (vi) in connection with any
litigation to which the Agent, any Bank, or any other Representative may be a
party, (vii) to the extent reasonably required in connection with the exercise
of any remedy hereunder, (viii) to the Agent's or such Bank's Affiliates, legal
counsel and independent

                                      -72-
<Page>

auditors or other Represenatives, and (ix) to any actual or proposed participant
or Eligible Assignee of all or part of its rights hereunder.

                   (d) Each of the Banks and the Agent hereby agrees that the
Borrower (and its, and its affiliates', employees, officers, directors, advisors
and agents (collectively "Borrower Representatives") is, and has been from the
commencement of discussions with respect to the Facility, permitted to disclose
to any and all Persons, without limitation of any kind, the structure and tax
aspects (as such terms are used in Code sections 6011 and 6111) of the Facility,
and all materials of any kind (including opinions or other tax analyses) that
are or have been provided to the Borrower related to such structure and tax
aspects. In this regard, the Borrower acknowledges and agrees that its
disclosure of the structure or tax aspects of the Facility is not limited in any
way by an express or implied understanding or agreement, oral or written
(whether or not such understanding or agreement is legally binding).
Furthermore, each of the Borrower, each Bank and the Agent acknowledges and
agrees that it does not know or have reason to know that its use or disclosure
of information relating to the structure or tax aspects of the Facility is
limited in any other manner (such as where the Facility is claimed to be
proprietary or exclusive) for the benefit of any other Person.

                   (e) The provisions of this Section 8.10 supersede any
confidentiality obligations of the Borrower, the Agent or any of the Banks
relating to the Facility under any agreements between or among the Borrower and
the Agent and/or the Banks, as applicable. The parties hereto agree that any
such confidentiality obligations shall be deemed void AB INITIO.

    Section 8.11.  COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS, CONTRACTS, LICENSES, AND PERMITS. The
Borrower will, and will cause BPI to, comply with, and will cause each of their
respective Subsidiaries to comply with (a) all applicable laws and regulations
now or hereafter in effect wherever its business is conducted, including,
without limitation, all Environmental Laws and all applicable federal and state
securities laws, (b) the provisions of its partnership agreement or corporate
charter and other charter documents and by-laws, as applicable, (c) all material
agreements and instruments to which it is a party or by which it or any of its
properties may be bound (including the Real Estate Assets and the Leases) and
(d) all applicable decrees, orders, and judgments, unless such non-compliance
does not relate to BPLP or BPI and constitutes a Non-Material Breach. If at any
time while any Loan or Note or Letter of Credit is outstanding or the Banks have
any obligation to make Loans or issue Letters of Credit hereunder, any Permit
shall become necessary or required in order that the Borrower may fulfill any of
its obligations hereunder, the Borrower and BPI and their respective
Subsidiaries will immediately take or cause to be taken all reasonable steps
within the power of the Borrower or BPI, as applicable, to obtain such Permit
and furnish the Agent with evidence thereof.

    Section 8.12.  USE OF PROCEEDS. Subject at all times to the other provisions
of this Agreement, the Borrower will use the proceeds of the Loans solely for
working capital

                                      -73-
<Page>

and general corporate purposes. It is agreed by the Banks that, from time to
time, the Borrower may request proceeds of the Loans be used to refinance
certain secured mortgage Indebtedness of the Borrower, in which event, a portion
of the Loans equal to the amount of the advances made hereunder in connection
with such refinancing may, at Borrower's election, be secured by the refinanced
mortgage (a "Refinancing Mortgage"). Any such Refinancing Mortgage would be (i)
required to be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Agent, (ii)
subject to customary terms and conditions reasonably satisfactory to the Agent,
(iii) amended and restated to provide for economic and other terms which are
identical to those of the Loans (e.g., the maturity date shall be amended to be
the Maturity Date hereunder and the interest rate and payment terms will be
amended to be the same as those hereunder, it being further acknowledged that
such modified interest rate may be based upon either a Revolving Credit Loan or
a Bid Rate Loan calculation, as elected by the Borrower pursuant to the terms
hereof) and (iv) subject to being released or transferred by the Agent at the
request of the Borrower. In addition, in connection with each Refinancing
Mortgage, the Agent would agree to provide, at the request of Borrower,
subordination, non-disturbance and attornment agreements in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Agent. No Real Estate Asset that is subject to a
Refinancing Mortgage will qualify as an Unencumbered Asset hereunder.

    Section 8.13.  ADDITION OF BORROWING BASE PROPERTY. Prior to the addition of
any Real Estate Asset to the Borrowing Base as a Borrowing Base Property, the
Borrower shall promptly deliver to the Agent (i) the Joinder Documents
(including the documents, instruments, certificates and agreements required
thereby). Upon satisfaction of the requirements of this Section 8.13, and
subject to the compliance of any such additional Borrowing Base Property with
the Borrowing Base Conditions, such Real Estate Asset shall be included as a
Borrowing Base Property.

    Section 8.14.  ADDITIONAL BORROWERS; SOLVENCY OF BORROWERS; REMOVAL OF
BORROWERS.

                   (a) If, after the Closing Date, BPLP wishes to designate as a
Borrowing Base Property a Real Estate Asset that otherwise qualifies as a
Borrowing Base Property but is owned or ground-leased by a Person other than the
Borrower, BPLP shall cause such Person (which Person must be a Wholly-owned
Subsidiary) to become a party to this Agreement and the other applicable Loan
Documents prior to such Real Estate Asset becoming a Borrowing Base Property
hereunder. The liability of each Borrower which is from time to time a Borrower
hereunder shall be joint and several with all other Borrowers for all
Obligations for so long as such Borrower is a Borrower hereunder (PROVIDED that
BPLP shall at all times be a Borrower hereunder). At any time and from time to
time but only for so long as no Default or Event of Default shall then exist,
BPLP may notify Agent, in writing (each, a "Release Notice"), that one (1) or
more Borrowing Base Properties are to be removed from the Borrowing Base. Such
Release Notice shall be accompanied by a Certificate of Compliance in the form
of EXHIBIT C-4, evidencing compliance. Immediately upon receipt of such Release
Notice and Certificate

                                      -74-
<Page>

of Compliance, such Borrowing Base Properties (each, a "Released Property")
shall be removed from the Borrowing Base and any Wholly-owned Subsidiary which
is the owner of a Released Property and which is then a Borrower (other than
BPLP) hereunder shall be released from its obligations hereunder (including the
Obligations), PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that any such release shall only be effective
as to Obligations arising after the applicable Release Notice (and the
Certificate of Compliance evidencing compliance) is received by Agent. BPLP will
not permit any Borrower (other than BPLP) that owns or ground leases any
Borrowing Base Property to have any Subsidiaries unless such Subsidiary's
business, obligations and undertakings are exclusively related to the business
of such Borrower.

                   (b) Each Borrower and BPI shall remain solvent at all times,
unless such failure to remain solvent does not relate to BPLP or BPI and is a
Non-Material Breach.

    Section 8.15.  FURTHER ASSURANCES. The Borrower will, and will cause BPI to,
cooperate with, the Agent and the Banks and execute such further instruments and
documents as the Banks or the Agent shall reasonably request to carry out to
their satisfaction the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other
Loan Documents.

    Section 8.16.  INTEREST RATE PROTECTION. In the event that the Borrower's
floating rate Indebtedness at any time exceeds forty-five percent (45%) of
Consolidated Total Indebtedness, the Borrower shall, upon the Agent's written
request (an "Agent Notice"), maintain in effect interest rate protection
arrangements (by means of hedging techniques or vehicles such as interest rate
swaps, interest rate caps, interest rate corridors or interest rate collars, in
each case to be capped at a rate reasonably satisfactory to the Agent and the
Majority Banks and otherwise in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
the Agent) for a tenor and in an amount reasonably satisfactory to the Agent and
the Majority Banks, provided that the amount of interest rate protection
required shall not exceed, in any event, the amount of the Borrower's floating
rate Indebtedness which is in excess of forty-five percent (45%) of Consolidated
Total Indebtedness. Once obtained, the Borrower shall maintain such arrangements
in full force and effect as provided therein, and shall not, without the
approval of the Majority Banks, modify, terminate, or transfer such arrangements
during the period in which the Borrower's floating rate Indebtedness exceeds
forty-five percent (45%) of Consolidated Total Indebtedness with respect to any
specific related Agent Notice. The Borrower may, at its option, enter into
additional interest rate protection arrangements permitted pursuant to Section
9.3.

    Section 8.17.  ENVIRONMENTAL INDEMNIFICATION. The Borrower covenants and
agrees that it will indemnify and hold the Agent and each Bank, and each of
their respective Affiliates, harmless from and against any and all claims,
expense, damage, loss or liability incurred by the Agent or any Bank (including
all reasonable costs of legal representation incurred by the Agent or any Bank,
but excluding, as applicable, for the Agent or a Bank any claim, expense,
damage, loss or liability as a result of the gross

                                      -75-
<Page>

negligence or willful misconduct of the Agent or such Bank or any of their
respective Affiliates) relating to (a) any Release or threatened Release of
Hazardous Substances on any Real Estate Asset; (b) any violation of any
Environmental Laws with respect to conditions at any Real Estate Asset or the
operations conducted thereon; (c) the investigation or remediation of off-site
locations at which the Borrower, BPI or any of their respective Subsidiaries or
their predecessors are alleged to have directly or indirectly disposed of
Hazardous Substances; or (d) any action, suit, proceeding or investigation
brought or threatened with respect to any Hazardous Substances relating to Real
Estate Assets (including, but not limited to, claims with respect to wrongful
death, personal injury or damage to property). It is expressly acknowledged by
the Borrower that, notwithstanding the introductory paragraph of this Section 8,
this covenant of indemnification shall survive the repayment of the amounts
owing under the Notes and this Agreement and the termination of this Agreement
and the obligations of the Banks hereunder and shall inure to the benefit of the
Agent and the Banks and their respective Affiliates, their respective
successors, and their respective assigns under the Loan Documents permitted
under this Agreement.

    Section 8.18.  RESPONSE ACTIONS. The Borrower covenants and agrees that if
any Release or disposal of Hazardous Substances shall occur or shall have
occurred on any Real Estate Asset owned directly or indirectly by the Borrower
or BPI, in violation of applicable Environmental Laws, the Borrower will cause
the prompt containment and removal of such Hazardous Substances and remediation
of such wholly-owned Real Estate Asset as necessary to comply with all
Environmental Laws.

    Section 8.19.  ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENTS. If the Agent in its good faith
judgment, after discussion with the Borrower and review of any environmental
reports provided by the Borrower, has reasonable grounds to believe that a
Disqualifying Environmental Event has occurred with respect to any one or more
of the Borrowing Base Properties, whether or not a Default or an Event of
Default shall have occurred, the Agent may, from time to time, for the purpose
of assessing and determining whether a Disqualifying Environmental Event has in
fact occurred, cause the Borrower to obtain one or more environmental
assessments or audits of such Borrowing Base Property prepared by a
hydrogeologist, an independent engineer or other qualified consultant or expert

effect thereto, the merger or consolidation of one or more Persons with and into
the Borrower or BPI shall be permitted in connection with the acquisition of
Real Estate Assets if the Borrower or BPI, as the case may be, is the surviving
entity; PROVIDED that (i) if any such merger or consolidation involves BPI, the
assets acquired (including any equity interests) are, promptly after the

one or more Wholly-owned Subsidiaries with and into the Borrower or (y) the
merger or consolidation of two or more Wholly owned Subsidiaries of the

Real Estate Asset from the Borrowing Base in connection with the curing of any
Default, Event of Default or Non-Material Breach, sell, transfer or otherwise

excess of 90% of "funds from operations"; (ii) Distributions in excess of 100%
of "funds from operations" for more than three consecutive fiscal quarters; or

(including while a monetary Event of Default is continuing) make Distributions
to the extent (after taking into account all available funds of BPI from all
other sources) required in order to enable BPI to continue to qualify as a REIT
and (b) in the event that the Borrower cures any such monetary default in clause
(iii) above and the Agent has accepted such cure prior to accelerating the Loan,
the limitation of clause (iii) above shall cease to apply with respect to such
monetary default. The Agent and the Banks acknowledge that, because
extraordinary gains are not included in "funds from operations", the
restrictions on Distributions do not restrict Distributions of extraordinary
gains, and such Distributions of extraordinary gains shall not be included in
the calculation of the percentages set forth above.

                   (b) BPI will not, during any period when any monetary Event
of Default has occurred and is continuing, make any Distributions in excess of

    Section 10.6.  BORROWING BASE PROPERTIES.

                   (a) As at the end of any fiscal quarter or any other date of
measurement, the Borrower shall not permit Unsecured Consolidated Total
Indebtedness (exclusive of Accounts Payable, but including amounts outstanding
under any Loans and the aggregate undrawn face amount of all outstanding Letters
of Credit after giving effect to Loan Requests) to equal or exceed 60% of the
aggregate Borrowing Base Value, PROVIDED that in the event that Consolidated
Total Indebtedness exceeds 60% of Consolidated Total Adjusted Asset Value at any
time, the Borrower shall not permit the Unsecured Consolidated Total
Indebtedness (exclusive of Accounts Payable, but including the outstanding
principal amount of all Loans and the aggregate undrawn face amount of all
outstanding Letters of Credit after giving effect to Loan Requests) to equal or
exceed 55% of the aggregate Borrowing Base Value.

                   (b) No more than 20% of the Borrowing Base Value shall be
derived from any single Borrowing Base Property, PROVIDED that from the Closing
Date through June 30, 2004, 399 Park Avenue (to the extent that it otherwise
qualifies as a Borrowing Base Property) may constitute up to 48% of the
Borrowing Base Value. On July 1, 2004, or if earlier, on the date that 399 Park
Avenue constitutes less than 35% of the Borrowing Base Value, then two (2)
Borrowing Base Properties may constitute up to 55% of the Borrowing Base Value
and such two (2) Borrowing Base Properties (and no others) may exceed the 20%
individual Borrowing Base Property limit referred to above. To evidence
compliance with the foregoing, the Borrower shall submit to the Agent a
compliance certificate in the form of EXHIBIT C-5.

                   (c) For purposes of determining the Borrowing Base Value, the
Net Operating Income of any Borrowing Base Property acquired during such prior
fiscal quarter shall be adjusted on a pro-forma basis by projecting the Net
Operating Income generated by each such acquired Borrowing Base Property for the
portion of the quarter during which it was owned or ground-leased by the
Borrower over the entire quarter.

                   (d) Notwithstanding the Borrowing Base Conditions, in the
event that the Borrower desires to include any Unencumbered Asset in the
Borrowing Base that does not meet one or more of the Borrowing Base Conditions,
any such Unencumbered

                                      -86-
<Page>

Asset shall only be permitted to be included in the Borrowing Base in the event
that (i) the Borrower has submitted to the Agent a compliance certificate in the
form of EXHIBIT C-5, modified to reflect the non-conformity of the proposed
Borrowing Base Property, and (ii) the Majority Banks have provided the Borrower
with written approval, in their sole discretion, for such non-conforming
Unencumbered Asset to be included in the Borrowing Base. Upon any such written
approval by the Majority Banks, such Unencumbered Asset shall be considered a
Borrowing Base Property for all purposes hereunder, PROVIDED that on the date of
inclusion of any such Unencumbered Asset in the Borrowing Base (and thereafter
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement), such Unencumbered Asset is
otherwise in compliance with the Borrowing Base Conditions other than with
respect to the non-conformity as certified by the Borrower and approved by the
Majority Banks in the compliance certificate submitted by the Borrower under
clause (i) of the preceding sentence, and PROVIDED, FURTHER that there is
otherwise no Default or Event of Default existing upon the date of, or arising
as a result of, the inclusion of such Unencumbered Asset in the Borrowing Base.

    (e)            The Borrowing Base must at all times be comprised of at least
fifteen (15) Real Estate Assets.

    Section 10.7.  BORROWING BASE DEBT SERVICE COVERAGE RATIO. As of the end of
any fiscal quarter or any other date of measurement, the Borrowing Base Debt
Service Coverage Ratio shall not be less than 1.40 to 1.0.

liability of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or BPI or any of its
Subsidiaries to the PBGC or such Guaranteed Pension Plan in an aggregate amount

continuing, the Agent may, and upon the request of the Majority Banks shall, by
notice in writing to the Borrower, declare all amounts owing with respect to
this Agreement, the Notes and the other Loan Documents and all Reimbursement
Obligations to be, and they shall thereupon forthwith become, immediately due
and payable without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind,
all of which are hereby expressly waived by the Borrower, BPI and each of their
respective Subsidiaries; PROVIDED that in the event of any Event of Default
specified in Section 14.1(g) or 14.1(h), all such amounts shall become
immediately due and payable automatically and without any requirement of notice
from any of the Banks or the Agent or action by the Banks or the Agent.

                   For purposes of this Section 14, the term "Non-Material
Breach" shall refer to a breach of any representation, warranty or covenant
contained in this Agreement to which the term "Non-Material Breach" is expressly
applied herein, but only to the extent such breach does not (A) materially
adversely affect the business, properties or financial condition of BPLP, BPI
or, taken as a whole, the BP Group or (B) adversely affect the ability of BPLP,
BPI or, taken as a whole, the BP Group, to fulfill the Obligations to the Banks
and the Agent (including, without limitation, to repay all amounts outstanding
on the Loans, together with interest and charges thereon when due).

                   Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 14.1
and in addition to the provisions set forth in the immediately preceding
paragraph, in the event of a Default, Event of Default or Non-Material Breach
arising as a result of the inclusion of any Real Estate Asset in the Borrowing
Base at any particular time of reference, if such Default,

                                      -95-
<Page>

Event of Default or Non-Material Breach is capable of being cured by the
exclusion of such Real Estate Asset from the Borrowing Base and from all other
covenant calculations under Section 10 or otherwise, the Borrower shall be
permitted a period not to exceed ten (10) days to submit to the Agent (with
copies to the Agent for each Bank) a compliance certificate in the form of
EXHIBIT C-4 hereto evidencing compliance with Section 2.1 and with all of the
covenants set forth in Section 10 (with calculations evidencing such compliance
after excluding from Borrowing Base Net Operating Income all of the Net
Operating Income generated by the Real Estate Asset to be excluded from the
Borrowing Base) and with the Borrowing Base Conditions, and otherwise certifying
that, after giving effect to the exclusion of such Real Estate Asset from the
Borrowing Base, no Default, Event of Default or Non-Material Breach will be
continuing.

    Section 14.2.  TERMINATION OF COMMITMENTS. If any one or more Events of
Default specified in Section 14.1(g) or Section 14.1(h) shall occur, any unused
portion of the Commitments or other commitments to extend credit hereunder shall
forthwith terminate and the Banks shall be relieved of all obligations to make
Loans to the Borrower and the Agent and any Fronting Bank shall be relieved of
all further obligations to issue, extend or renew Letters of Credit. If any
other Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, whether or not the
Banks shall have accelerated the maturity of the Loans pursuant to Section 14.1,
any Bank may, by notice to the Borrower, terminate the unused portion of that
Bank's Commitment or other commitment to extend credit hereunder, and upon such
notice being given such unused portion of such Commitment or other commitment
shall terminate immediately, such Bank shall be relieved of all further
obligations to make Loans, the Agent and any Fronting Bank shall be relieved of
all further obligations to issue, extend or renew Letters of Credit and the
Total Commitments shall be reduced accordingly. No such termination of a
Commitment or other commitment to extend credit hereunder shall relieve the
Borrower of any of the Obligations or any of its existing obligations to such
Bank arising under other agreements or instruments.

    Section 14.3.  REMEDIES. In the event that one or more Events of Default
shall have occurred and be continuing, whether or not the Banks shall have
accelerated the maturity of the Loans pursuant to Section 14.1, the Majority
Banks may direct the Agent to proceed to protect and enforce the rights and
remedies of the Agent and the Banks under this Agreement, the Notes, any or all
of the other Loan Documents or under applicable law by suit in equity, action at
law or other appropriate proceeding (including for the specific performance of
any covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement or the other Loan
Documents or any instrument pursuant to which the Obligations are evidenced and,
to the full extent permitted by applicable law, the obtaining of the EX PARTE
appointment of a receiver), and, if any amount shall have become due, by
declaration or otherwise, proceed to enforce the payment thereof or any other
legal or equitable right or remedy of the Agent and the Banks under the Loan
Documents or applicable law. No remedy herein conferred upon the Banks or the
Agent or the holder of any Note or purchaser of any Letter of Credit
Participation is intended to be exclusive of any other remedy and each and every
remedy shall be cumulative and shall be in addition to every other remedy

                                      -96-
<Page>

given hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents or now or hereafter
existing at law or in equity or by statute or any other provision of law.

    Section 15.    SETOFF. Neither the Agent nor any of the Banks shall have any
right of set-off or the like with respect to the Obligations against any assets
of the Borrower, BPI, their respective Subsidiaries or any Partially-Owned
Entity.

    Section 16.    THE AGENT.

    Section 16.1.  AUTHORIZATION. (a) The Agent is authorized to take such
action on behalf of each of the Banks and to exercise all such powers as are
hereunder and under any of the other Loan Documents and any related documents
delegated to the Agent, together with such powers as are reasonably incident
thereto, PROVIDED that no duties or responsibilities not expressly assumed
herein or therein shall be implied to have been assumed by the Agent. The
relationship between the Agent and the Banks is and shall be that of agent and
principal only, and nothing contained in this Agreement or any of the other Loan
Documents shall be construed to constitute the Agent as a trustee or fiduciary
for any Bank.

                   (b) The Borrower, without further inquiry or investigation,
shall, and is hereby authorized by the Banks to, assume that all actions taken
by the Agent hereunder and in connection with or under the Loan Documents are
duly authorized by the Banks. The Banks shall notify Borrower of any successor
to Agent by a writing signed by Majority Banks, which successor shall be
reasonably acceptable to the Borrower so long as no Default or Event of Default
has occurred and is continuing. The Borrower acknowledges that any Bank which
acquires Fleet is acceptable as a successor to the Agent.

    Section 16.2.  EMPLOYEES AND AGENTS. The Agent may exercise its powers and
execute its duties by or through employees or agents and shall be entitled to
take, and to rely on, advice of counsel concerning all matters pertaining to its
rights and duties under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. The Agent
may utilize the services of such Persons as the Agent in its sole discretion may
reasonably determine, and all reasonable fees and expenses of any such Persons
shall be paid by the Borrower.

    Section 16.3.  NO LIABILITY. Neither the Agent, nor any of its shareholders,
directors, officers or employees nor any other Person assisting them in their
duties nor any agent or employee thereof, shall be liable for any waiver,
consent or approval given or any action taken, or omitted to be taken, in good
faith by it or them hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents, or in
connection herewith or therewith, or be responsible for the consequences of any
oversight or error of judgment whatsoever, except that the Agent may be liable
for losses due to its willful misconduct or gross negligence.

                                      -97-
<Page>

    Section 16.4.  NO REPRESENTATIONS. The Agent shall not be responsible for
the execution or validity or enforceability of this Agreement, the Notes, the
Letters of Credit, or any of the other Loan Documents or for the validity,
enforceability or collectibility of any such amounts owing with respect to the
Notes, or for any recitals or statements, warranties or representations made
herein or in any of the other Loan Documents or in any certificate or instrument
hereafter furnished to it by or on behalf of BPI or the Borrower or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, or be bound to ascertain or inquire as to the
performance or observance of any of the terms, conditions, covenants or
agreements in this Agreement or the other Loan Documents. The Agent shall not be
bound to ascertain whether any notice, consent, waiver or request delivered to
it by the Borrower or BPI or any holder of any of the Notes shall have been duly
authorized or is true, accurate and complete. The Agent has not made nor does it
now make any representations or warranties, express or implied, nor does it
assume any liability to the Banks, with respect to the credit worthiness or
financial condition of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or BPI or any of
the Subsidiaries or any tenant under a Lease or any other entity. Each Bank
acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Agent or
any other Bank, and based upon such information and documents as it has deemed
appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this
Agreement.

    Section 16.5.  PAYMENTS.

                   (a) A payment by the Borrower to the Agent hereunder or any
of the other Loan Documents for the account of any Bank shall constitute a
payment to such Bank. The Agent agrees to distribute to each Bank such Bank's
PRO RATA share of payments received by the Agent for the account of the Banks,
as provided herein or in any of the other Loan Documents. All such payments
shall be made on the date received, if before 1:00 p.m., and if after 1:00 p.m.,
on the next Business Day. If payment is not made on the day received, the funds
shall be invested by the Agent in overnight obligations, and interest thereon
paid PRO RATA to the Banks.

                   (b) If in the reasonable opinion of the Agent the
distribution of any amount received by it in such capacity hereunder, under the
Notes or under any of the other Loan Documents might involve it in material
liability, it may refrain from making distribution until its right to make
distribution shall have been adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction,
PROVIDED that the Agent shall invest any such undistributed amounts in overnight
obligations on behalf of the Banks and interest thereon shall be paid PRO RATA
to the Banks. If a court of competent jurisdiction shall adjudge that any amount
received and distributed by the Agent is to be repaid, each Person to whom any
such distribution shall have been made shall either repay to the Agent its
proportionate share of the amount so adjudged to be repaid or shall pay over the
same in such manner and to such Persons as shall be determined by such court.

                   (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, any Bank that fails (i) to
make available

                                      -98-
<Page>

to the Agent its PRO RATA share of any Loan or to purchase any Letter of Credit
Participation or (ii) to adjust promptly such Bank's outstanding principal and
its PRO rata Commitment Percentage as provided in Section 2.1, shall be deemed
delinquent (a "Delinquent Bank") and shall be deemed a Delinquent Bank until
such time as such delinquency is satisfied. A Delinquent Bank shall be deemed to
have assigned any and all payments due to it from the Borrower, whether on
account of outstanding Loans, interest, fees or otherwise, to the remaining
nondelinquent Banks for application to, and reduction of, their respective PRO
RATA shares of all outstanding Loans. The Delinquent Bank hereby authorizes the
Agent to distribute such payments to the nondelinquent Banks in proportion to
their respective PRO RATA shares of all outstanding Loans. If not previously
satisfied directly by the Delinquent Bank, a Delinquent Bank shall be deemed to
have satisfied in full a delinquency when and if, as a result of application of
the assigned payments to all outstanding Loans of the nondelinquent Banks, the
Banks' respective PRO RATA shares of all outstanding Loans have returned to
those in effect immediately prior to such delinquency and without giving effect
to the nonpayment causing such delinquency.

    Section 16.6.  HOLDERS OF NOTES. The Agent may deem and treat the payee of
any Notes or the purchaser of any Letter of Credit Participation as the absolute
owner or purchaser thereof for all purposes hereof until it shall have been
furnished in writing with a different name by such payee or by a subsequent
holder, assignee or transferee.

    Section 16.7.  INDEMNITY. The Banks ratably and severally agree hereby to
indemnify and hold harmless the Agent and its Affiliates from and against any
and all claims, actions and suits (whether groundless or otherwise), losses,
damages, costs, expenses (including any expenses for which the Agent has not
been reimbursed by the Borrower as required by Section 17), and liabilities of
every nature and character arising out of or related to this Agreement, the
Notes, or any of the other Loan Documents or the transactions contemplated or
evidenced hereby or thereby, or the Agent's actions taken hereunder or
thereunder, except to the extent that any of the same shall be directly caused
by the Agent's willful misconduct or gross negligence.

    Section 16.8.  AGENT AS BANK. In its individual capacity as a Bank, Fleet
shall have the same obligations and the same rights, powers and privileges in
respect to its Commitment and the Loans made by it, and as the holder of any of
the Notes and as the purchaser of any Letter of Credit Participations, as it
would have were it not also the Agent.

    Section 16.9.  NOTIFICATION OF DEFAULTS AND EVENTS OF DEFAULT. Each Bank
hereby agrees that, upon learning of the existence of a Default or an Event of
Default, it shall (to the extent notice has not previously been provided)
promptly notify the Agent thereof. The Agent hereby agrees that upon receipt of
any notice under this Section 16.9 it shall promptly notify the other Banks of
the existence of such Default or Event of Default.

    Section 16.10. DUTIES IN THE CASE OF ENFORCEMENT. In case one or more Events
of Default have occurred and shall be continuing, and whether or not
acceleration of the

                                      -99-
<Page>

Obligations shall have occurred, the Agent shall, if (a) so requested by the
Majority Banks and (b) the Banks have provided to the Agent such additional
indemnities and assurances against expenses and liabilities as the Agent may
reasonably request, proceed to enforce the provisions of this Agreement and
exercise all or any such other legal and equitable and other rights or remedies
as it may have in respect of enforcement of the Banks' rights against the
Borrower and its Subsidiaries under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.
The Majority Banks may direct the Agent in writing as to the method and the
extent of any such enforcement, the Banks (including any Bank which is not one
of the Majority Banks) hereby agreeing to ratably and severally indemnify and
hold the Agent harmless from all liabilities incurred in respect of all actions
taken or omitted in accordance with such directions, PROVIDED that the Agent
need not comply with any such direction to the extent that the Agent reasonably
believes the Agent's compliance with such direction to be unlawful or
commercially unreasonable in any applicable jurisdiction.

    Section 16.11. SUCCESSOR AGENT. Fleet, or any successor Agent, may resign as
Agent at any time by giving at least 30 days prior written notice thereof to the
Banks and to the Borrower. The Majority Banks may remove the Agent in the event
of the Agent's willful misconduct or gross negligence or in the event that the
Agent ceases to hold a Commitment under this Agreement. In addition, the
Borrower may remove the Agent in the event that the Agent holds (without
participation) less than the Minimum Commitment, PROVIDED that if the Agent
holds less than the Minimum Commitment at any time as a result of the merger or
consolidation of any of the other Banks or as a result of events other than the
sale by the Agent of any portion of its Commitment, the Agent shall have a
period of ninety (90) days after its failure to hold at least the Minimum
Commitment to cure such failure. Any such resignation or removal shall be
effective upon appointment and acceptance of a successor Agent, as hereinafter
provided. Upon any such resignation or removal, the Majority Banks shall have
the right to appoint a successor Agent, which is a Bank under this Agreement and
which holds at least the Minimum Commitment, PROVIDED that so long as no Default
or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing the Borrower shall have the
right to approve any successor Agent, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld. If, in the case of a resignation by the Agent, no successor Agent
shall have been so appointed by the Majority Banks and approved by the Borrower,
and shall have accepted such appointment, within thirty (30) days after the
retiring Agent's giving of notice of resignation, then the retiring Agent may,
on behalf of the Banks, appoint any one of the other Banks as a successor Agent.
The Borrower acknowledges that any Bank which acquires Fleet is acceptable as a
successor Agent. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Agent hereunder by a
successor Agent, such successor Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become
vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring or
removed Agent, and the retiring or removed Agent shall be discharged from all
further duties and obligations as Agent under this Agreement. After any Agent's
resignation or removal hereunder as Agent, the provisions of this Section 16
shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be

                                      -100-
<Page>

taken by it while it was Agent under this Agreement. The Agent agrees that it
shall not assign any of its rights or duties as Agent to any other Person.

    Section 16.12. NOTICES. Any notices or other information required hereunder
to be provided to the Agent (with copies to the Agent for each Bank) shall be
forwarded by the Agent to each of the Banks on the same day (if practicable)
and, in any case, on the next Business Day following the Agent's receipt thereof

    Section 17.    EXPENSES. The Borrower agrees to pay (a) the reasonable costs
of producing and reproducing this Agreement, the other Loan Documents and the
other agreements and instruments mentioned herein, (b) the reasonable fees,
expenses and disbursements of the Agent's outside counsel or any local counsel
to the Agent incurred in connection with the preparation, administration or
interpretation of the Loan Documents and other instruments mentioned herein,
each closing hereunder, and amendments, modifications, approvals, consents or
waivers hereto or hereunder, (c) the fees, expenses and disbursements of the
Agent incurred by the Agent in connection with the preparation, administration
or interpretation of the Loan Documents and other instruments mentioned herein,
including, without limitation, the costs incurred by the Agent in connection
with its inspection of the Borrowing Base Properties (subject to Section 12.14),
and, without double-counting amounts under clause (b) above, the fees and
disbursements of the Agent's counsel in preparing the documentation, (d) the
fees, costs, expenses and disbursements of the Agent and its Affiliates incurred
in connection with the initial syndication and/or participations of the Loans
(whether occurring before or after the closing hereunder), including, without
limitation, reasonable legal fees, travel costs, costs of preparing syndication
materials and photocopying costs, PROVIDED that the Borrower shall not incur any
costs or fees of any kind in connection with any participation, sale or other
syndication of any portion of the Loans which occurs after the initial
syndication other than reasonable legal fees and expenses incurred in connection
with any participation, sale or syndication undertaken at the request of the
Borrower or (in addition to any other fees or expenses relating thereto) in
connection with an amendment or increase to the amount of the Total Commitment,
(e) all reasonable expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs,
which attorneys may be employees of any Bank or the Agent, and the fees and
costs of engineers, investment bankers, or other experts retained by any Bank or
the Agent in connection with any such enforcement proceedings) incurred by any
Bank or the Agent in connection with (i) the enforcement of or preservation of
rights under any of the Loan Documents against the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries or BPI or the administration thereof after the occurrence and
during the continuance of a Default or Event of Default (including, without
limitation, expenses incurred in any restructuring and/or "workout" of the
Loans), and (ii) any litigation, proceeding or dispute whether arising hereunder
or otherwise, in any way related to any Bank's or the Agent's relationship with
the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or BPI, (f) all reasonable fees,
expenses and disbursements of the Agent incurred in connection with UCC
searches, UCC terminations or mortgage discharges, and (g) all costs incurred by
the Agent in the future in connection with its inspection of the Borrowing Base
Properties, PROVIDED that

                                      -101-
<Page>

prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default, the Borrower shall not be
required to pay for more than one inspection of each Borrowing Base Property per
year. The covenants of this Section 17 shall survive the repayment of the
amounts owing under the Notes and this Agreement and the termination of this
Agreement and the obligations of the Banks hereunder.

    Section 18.    INDEMNIFICATION. The Borrower agrees to indemnify and hold
harmless the Agent and each of the Banks and the shareholders, directors,
agents, officers, subsidiaries and affiliates of the Agent and each of the Banks
from and against any and all claims, actions and suits, whether groundless or
otherwise, and from and against any and all liabilities, losses (including
amounts, if any, owing to any Bank pursuant to Section Section 5.4, 5.5, 5.6 and
5.8), settlement payments, obligations, damages and expenses of every nature and
character in connection therewith, arising out of this Agreement or any of the
other Loan Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or which
otherwise arise in connection with the financing, including, without limitation,
(a) any actual or proposed use by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries of the
proceeds of any of the Loans, (b) the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries
entering into or performing this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents,
or (c) pursuant to Section 8.17, in each case including, without limitation, the
reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel and allocated costs of internal
counsel incurred in connection with any such investigation, litigation or other
proceeding, PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Borrower shall not be obligated under
this Section 18 to indemnify any Person for liabilities arising from such
Person's own gross negligence, willful misconduct or breach of this Agreement.
In litigation, or the preparation therefor, the Borrower shall be entitled to
select counsel reasonably acceptable to the Majority Banks, and the Agent (as
approved by the Majority Banks) shall be entitled to select their own
supervisory counsel, and, in addition to the foregoing indemnity, the Borrower
agrees to pay promptly the reasonable fees and expenses of each such counsel.
Prior to any settlement of any such litigation by the Banks, the Banks shall
provide the Borrower and BPI with notice and an opportunity to address any of
their concerns with the Banks, and the Banks shall not settle any litigation
without first obtaining Borrower's consent thereto, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. If and to the extent that the obligations of
the Borrower under this Section 18 are unenforceable for any reason, the
Borrower hereby agrees to make the maximum contribution to the payment in
satisfaction of such obligations which is permissible under applicable law. The
provisions of this Section 18 shall survive the repayment of the amounts owing
under the Notes and this Agreement and the termination of this Agreement and the
obligations of the Banks hereunder and shall continue in full force and effect
as long as the possibility of any such claim, action, cause of action or suit
exists.

    Section 19.    SURVIVAL OF COVENANTS, ETC. All covenants, agreements,
representations and warranties made herein, in the Notes, in any of the other
Loan Documents or in any documents or other papers delivered by or on behalf of
the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or BPI pursuant hereto shall be deemed
to have been relied upon

                                      -102-
<Page>

by the Banks and the Agent, notwithstanding any investigation heretofore or
hereafter made by any of them, and shall survive the making by the Banks of any
of the Loans and the issuance, extension or renewal of any Letters of Credit, as
herein contemplated, and shall continue in full force and effect so long as any
Letter of Credit or any amount due under this Agreement or the Notes or any of
the other Loan Documents remains outstanding or any Bank has any obligation to
make any Loans or the Agent or any Fronting Bank has any obligation to issue,
extend or renew any Letter of Credit. The indemnification obligations of the
Borrower provided herein and in the other Loan Documents shall survive the full
repayment of amounts due and the termination of the obligations of the Banks
hereunder and thereunder to the extent provided herein and therein. All
statements contained in any certificate or other paper delivered to any Bank or
the Agent at any time by or on behalf of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries
or BPI pursuant hereto or in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby shall constitute representations and warranties by the Borrower or such
Subsidiary or BPI hereunder.

    Section 20.    ASSIGNMENT; PARTICIPATIONS; ETC.

    Section 20.1.  CONDITIONS TO ASSIGNMENT BY BANKS. Except as provided herein,
each Bank may assign to one or more Eligible Assignees all or a portion of its
interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a
portion of its Commitment Percentage and Commitment and the same portion of the
Loans at the time owing to it, the Notes held by it and its participating
interest in the risk relating to any Letters of Credit); PROVIDED that (a) the
Agent and, other than during an Event of Default, the Borrower each shall have
the right to approve any Eligible Assignee, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed, it being agreed that the Agent and the
Borrower must approve or reject a proposed Eligible Assignee within seven (7)
days of receiving a written request from any Bank for such approval (PROVIDED
that the request for approval, and the envelope in which it is delivered, is
conspicuously marked with the following legend: "REQUEST FOR APPROVAL -- TIME
SENSITIVE -- MUST RESPOND WITHIN SEVEN (7) DAYS") and if the Agent or the
Borrower fails to respond within such seven (7) day period, such request for
approval shall be deemed approved by the Agent or the Borrower, or both, as the
case may be, (b) each such assignment shall be of a constant, and not a varying,
percentage of all the assigning Bank's rights and obligations under this
Agreement, (c) subject to the provisions of Section 2.7, each Bank shall have at
all times an amount of its Commitment of not less than $10,000,000 unless
otherwise consented to by the Agent and, other than during an Event of Default,
the Borrower and (d) the parties to such assignment shall execute and deliver to
the Agent, for recording in the Register (as hereinafter defined), an assignment
and assumption, substantially in the form of EXHIBIT F hereto (an "Assignment
and Assumption"), together with any Notes subject to such assignment. Upon such
execution, delivery, acceptance and recording, from and after the effective date
specified in each Assignment and Assumption, which effective date shall be at
least two (2) Business Days after the execution thereof unless otherwise agreed
by the Agent (PROVIDED

                                      -103-
<Page>

any assignee has assumed the obligation to fund any outstanding Eurodollar Rate
Loans), (i) the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent
provided in such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a
Bank hereunder and thereunder, and (ii) the assigning Bank shall, to the extent
provided in such assignment and upon payment to the Agent of the registration
fee referred to in Section 20.3, be released from its obligations under this
Agreement. Any such Assignment and Assumption shall run to the benefit of the
Borrower and a copy of any such Assignment and Assumption shall be delivered by
the Assignor to the Borrower.

    Notwithstanding the provisions of subclause (a) of the preceding paragraph,
any Bank may, without the consent of the Borrower, make an assignment otherwise
permitted hereunder to (x) another Bank, and (y) an Affiliate of such Bank,
PROVIDED that such Affiliate is an Eligible Assignee. Without limiting the
provisions of Section 17, with respect to an assignment by a Bank to its
Affiliate or to another Bank which does not require the consent of the Borrower,
unless such assignment occurs at the request of the Borrower, the Borrower shall
not be responsible for any costs or expenses attributable to such assignment,
all of which shall be payable by the assigning Bank.

    Section 20.2.  CERTAIN REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES; LIMITATIONS;
COVENANTS. By executing and delivering an Assignment and Assumption, the parties
to the assignment thereunder confirm to and agree with each other and the other
parties hereto as follows: (a) other than the representation and warranty that

the execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or
value of this Agreement, the other Loan Documents or any other instrument or
document furnished pursuant hereto; (b) the assigning Bank makes no
representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to the
financial condition of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries or BPI or any other
Person primarily or secondarily liable in respect of any of the Obligations, or

other Person primarily or secondarily liable in respect of any of the
Obligations of any of their obligations under this Agreement or any of the other
Loan Documents or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto or
thereto; (c) such assignee confirms that it has received a copy of this

into such Assignment and Assumption; (d) such assignee will, independently and

continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under
this Agreement; (e) such assignee represents and warrants that it is an Eligible
Assignee; (f) such assignee appoints and authorizes the Agent to take such
action as agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers under this Agreement

<Page>

delegated to the Agent by the terms hereof or thereof, together with such powers
as are reasonably incidental thereto; (g) such assignee agrees that it will
perform in accordance with their terms all of the obligations that by the terms

assignee represents and warrants that it is legally authorized to enter into
such Assignment and Assumption; and (i) such assignee acknowledges that it has
made arrangements with the assigning Bank satisfactory to such assignee with
respect to its pro rata share of Letter of Credit Fees in respect of outstanding
Letters of Credit.

    Section 20.3.  REGISTER. The Agent shall maintain a copy of each Assignment
and Assumption delivered to it and a register or similar list (the "Register")
for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Banks and the Commitment
Percentages of, and principal amount of the Loans owing to, the Banks from time
to time. The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, in the absence of
manifest error, and the Borrower, the Agent and the Banks may treat each Person
whose name is recorded in the Register as a Bank hereunder for all purposes of
this Agreement. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower
and the Banks at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior
notice. Upon each such recordation, the assigning Bank agrees to pay to the
Agent a registration fee in the sum of $2,500.

    Section 20.4.  NEW NOTES. Upon its receipt of an Assignment and Assumption
executed by the parties to such assignment, together with each Note subject to
such assignment, the Agent shall (a) record the information contained therein in
the Register, and (b) give prompt notice thereof to the Borrower and the Banks
(other than the assigning Bank). Unless done simultaneously with the Assignment
and Assumption, within two (2) Business Days after receipt of such notice, the
Borrower, at its own expense, (i) shall execute and deliver to the Agent, in
exchange for each surrendered Revolving Credit Note, a new Revolving Credit Note
and Swingline Note or Bid Rate Note, if applicable, to the order of such
Eligible Assignee in an amount equal to the amount assumed by such Eligible
Assignee pursuant to such Assignment and Assumption and, if the assigning Bank
has retained some portion of its obligations hereunder, a new Revolving Credit
Note and other Note, if applicable, to the order of the assigning Bank in an
amount equal to the amount retained by it hereunder and (ii) shall deliver an
opinion from counsel to the Borrower in substantially the form delivered on the
Closing Date pursuant to Section 12.9 as to such new Notes. Such new Notes shall
provide that they are replacements for the surrendered Notes, shall be in an
aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of the
surrendered Notes, shall be dated the effective date of such Assignment and
Assumption and shall otherwise be in substantially the form of the assigned
Notes. The surrendered Notes shall be canceled and returned to the Borrower.

    Section 20.5.  PARTICIPATIONS. Each Bank may sell participations to one or
more banks or other entities in all or a portion of such Bank's rights and
obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents; provided that (a)
each such participation shall be in an amount of not less than $10,000,000, (b)
any such sale or participation shall not

                                      -105-
<Page>

affect the rights and duties of the selling Bank hereunder to the Borrower and
the Agent and the Bank shall continue to exercise all approvals, disapprovals
and other functions of a Bank, (c) the only rights granted to the participant
pursuant to such participation arrangements with respect to waivers, amendments
or modifications of, or approvals under, the Loan Documents shall be the rights
to approve waivers, amendments or modifications that would reduce the principal
of or the interest rate on any Loans, extend the term or increase the amount of
the Commitment of such Bank as it relates to such participant, reduce the amount
of any fees to which such participant is entitled or extend any regularly
scheduled payment date for principal or interest, and (d) no participant shall
have the right to grant further participations or assign its rights, obligations
or interests under such participation to other Persons without the prior written
consent of the Agent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

    Section 20.6.  PLEDGE BY LENDER. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, any Bank at no cost to the Borrower may at any time pledge all or any
portion of its interest and rights under this Agreement (including all or any
portion of its Notes) to any of the twelve Federal Reserve Banks organized under
Section 4 of the Federal Reserve Act, 12 U.S.C. Section 341. No such pledge or
the enforcement thereof shall release the pledgor Bank from its obligations
hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents.

    Section 20.7.  NO ASSIGNMENT BY BORROWER. The Borrower shall not assign or
transfer any of its rights or obligations under any of the Loan Documents
without prior Unanimous Bank Approval.

    Section 20.8.  DISCLOSURE. The Borrower agrees that, in addition to
disclosures made in accordance with standard banking practices, any Bank may
disclose information obtained by such Bank pursuant to this Agreement to
assignees or participants and potential assignees or participants hereunder. Any
such disclosed information shall be treated by any assignee or participant with
the same standard of confidentiality set forth in Section 8.10.

    Section 20.9.  SYNDICATION. The Borrower acknowledges that each of the Agent
and the Arranger intends, and shall have the right, by itself or through its
Affiliates, to syndicate or enter into co-lending arrangements with respect to
the Loans and the Total Commitment pursuant to this Section 20, and the Borrower
agrees to cooperate with the Agent's and the Arranger's and their Affiliate's
syndication and/or co-lending efforts, such cooperation to include, without
limitation, the provision of information reasonably requested by potential
syndicate members.

Agreement, all notices and other communications made or required to be given

                                      -108-
<Page>

THE BORROWER AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR
ATTORNEY OF ANY BANK OR THE AGENT HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT
SUCH BANK OR THE AGENT WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE
THE FOREGOING WAIVERS AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE AGENT AND THE BANKS HAVE
BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS TO WHICH
THEY ARE PARTIES BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS
CONTAINED HEREIN.

    Section 28.    CONSENTS, AMENDMENTS, WAIVERS, ETC. Except as otherwise
expressly provided in this Agreement, any consent or approval required or
permitted by this Agreement may be given, and any term of this Agreement or of
any of the other Loan Documents may be amended, and the performance or
observance by the Borrower or BPI or any of their respective Subsidiaries of any
terms of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents or the continuance of any
Default or Event of Default may be waived (either generally or in a particular
instance and either retroactively or prospectively) with, but only with, the
written consent of the Majority Banks.

    Notwithstanding the foregoing, Unanimous Bank Approval shall be required for
any amendment, modification or waiver of this Agreement that:

                            (i)   reduces or forgives any principal of any
                       unpaid Loan or any interest thereon (including any
                       interest "breakage" costs) or any fees due any Bank
                       hereunder, or permits any prepayment not otherwise
                       permitted hereunder; or

                            (ii)  changes the unpaid principal amount of any
                       Loan, reduces the rate of interest applicable to any
                       Loan, or reduces any fee payable to the Banks hereunder;
                       or

                            (iii) changes the date fixed for any payment of
                       principal of or interest on any Loan (including, without
                       limitation, any extension of the Maturity Date) or any
                       fees payable hereunder (including, without limitation,
                       the waiver of any monetary Event of Default); or

                            (iv)  changes the amount of any Bank's Commitment
                       (other than pursuant to an assignment permitted under
                       Section 20.1) or increases the amount of the Total
                       Commitment except as permitted hereunder; or

                            (v)   modifies any provision herein or in any other
                       Loan Document which by the terms thereof expressly
                       requires Unanimous Bank Approval; or

                                      -109-
<Page>

                            (vi)  changes the definitions of Majority Banks,
                       Required Banks or Unanimous Bank Approval.

    No waiver shall extend to or affect any obligation not expressly waived or
impair any right consequent thereon. No course of dealing or delay or omission
on the part of the Agent or the Banks or any Bank in exercising any right shall
operate as a waiver thereof or otherwise be prejudicial to such right or any
other rights of the Agent or the Banks. No notice to or demand upon the Borrower
shall entitle the Borrower to other or further notice or demand in similar or
other circumstances.

    Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Required Banks shall be required for any
amendment, modification or waiver of this agreement that:

                            (i)   amends any of the covenants contained in
                       Section 10.1 through Section 10.7, inclusive or amends
                       any of the definitions which are financial terms
                       contained therein, or

                            (ii)  amends any of the provisions governing funding
                       contained in Section 2, or

                            (iii) changes the rights, duties or obligations of
                       the Agent specified in Section 16 (PROVIDED that no
                       amendment or modification to such Section 16 or to the
                       fee payable to the Agent under this Agreement may be made
                       without the prior written consent of the Agent and that
                       the waiver of any fee payable to the Agent shall require
                       only the consent of the Agent).

    In addition, no amendment or modification to or waiver of the provisions of
Section 2.8 may be made without the prior written consent of the Swingline
Lender and, without limitation of the provisions requiring Unanimous Bank
Approval or the consent of the Required Banks, no amendment or modification to
or waiver of the provisions of Section 2.9 may be made without the prior written
consent of those Banks holding more than 50% of the outstanding Bid Rate Loans
at the applicable time of reference.

    Section 29.    SEVERABILITY. The provisions of this Agreement are severable,
and if any one clause or provision hereof shall be held invalid or unenforceable
in whole or in part in any jurisdiction, then such invalidity or
unenforceability shall affect only such clause or provision, or part thereof, in
such jurisdiction, and shall not in any manner affect such clause or provision
in any other jurisdiction, or any other clause or provision of this Agreement in
any jurisdiction.

    Section 30.    INTEREST RATE LIMITATION. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, if at any time the interest rate applicable to any Loan, together
with all fees, charges and other amounts which are treated as interest on such
Loan under applicable law (collectively, the "Charges"), shall exceed the
maximum lawful rate (the "Maximum Rate") which may be contracted for, charged,
taken, received or reserved by the Bank holding such Loan in accordance with
applicable law, the rate of interest payable in respect of such Loan hereunder,
together with all Charges payable in respect thereof, shall be limited to the
Maximum Rate and, to the extent lawful, the interest and Charges that would have
been payable in respect of such Loan but were not payable as a result of the
operation of this Section 30 shall be cumulated and the interest and Charges
payable to such Bank in respect of other Loans or periods shall be increased
(but not above the Maximum Rate therefor) until such cumulated amount, together
with interest thereon at the Federal Funds Rate to the date of repayment, shall
have been received by such Bank.

waived by the Borrower, excepting only for notice expressly provided for in the
Revolving Credit Agreement.

    All computations of interest payable as provided in this Note shall be made

with the terms of the Revolving Credit Agreement.

    Should all or any part of the indebtedness represented by this Note be
collected by action at law, or in bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or other

brought against the Borrower by the holder hereof arising out of or relating to
this Note. This Note may be executed in any number of counterparts and by each
party on a separate counterpart, each of which when so executed and delivered
shall be an original, and all of which together shall constitute one instrument.

                                 SWINGLINE NOTE

$60,000,000                                       Date:  January __, 2003

    FOR VALUE RECEIVED, the undersigned Boston Properties Limited Partnership, a
Delaware limited partnership, and each of the other undersigned parties and
other parties who are or from time to time become a Borrower under (and as
defined in) the Revolving Credit Agreement referred to below (hereinafter,
together with their respective successors in title and assigns, collectively
called the "Borrower"), by this promissory note (hereinafter, called "this
Note"), absolutely and unconditionally and jointly and severally promise to pay
to the order of FLEET NATIONAL BANK (hereinafter, together with its successors
in title and assigns, called the "Bank"), the principal sum of Sixty Million and
00/100 Dollars ($60,000,000), or so much thereof as shall have been advanced by
the Bank to the Borrower by way of Swingline Loans under (and as defined in) the
Revolving Credit Agreement and shall remain outstanding, such payment to be made
as hereinafter provided, and to pay interest on the principal sum outstanding
hereunder from time to time from and after the date hereof until the said
principal sum or the unpaid portion thereof shall have become due and payable as
hereinafter provided.

    Capitalized terms used herein without definition shall have the meanings set
forth in the Revolving Credit Agreement.

    The unpaid principal (not at the time overdue) under this Note shall bear
interest at the rate or rates from time to time in effect under the Revolving
Credit Agreement. Accrued interest on the unpaid principal under this Note shall
be payable on the dates specified in the Revolving Credit Agreement.

    On the maturity date of any particular Swingline Loan as provided in the
Revolving Credit Agreement, and in any event on the Maturity Date, there shall
become absolutely due and payable by the Borrower hereunder, and the Borrower
hereby promises to pay to the Bank, the balance (if any) of the principal hereof
then remaining unpaid, all of the unpaid interest accrued hereon and all (if
any) other amounts payable on or in respect of this Note or the indebtedness
evidenced hereby.

    Each overdue amount (whether of principal, interest or otherwise) payable on
or in respect of this Note or the indebtedness evidenced hereby shall (to the
extent permitted by applicable law) bear interest at the rates and on the terms
provided in the Revolving Credit Agreement. The unpaid interest accrued on each
overdue amount in accordance with the foregoing terms of this paragraph shall
become and be absolutely due and payable by the Borrower to Bank on demand by
the Agent. Interest on each overdue

                                      A-1-1

amount will continue to accrue as provided by the foregoing terms of this
paragraph, and will (to the extent permitted by applicable law) be compounded
daily until the obligations of the Borrower in respect of the payment of such
overdue amount shall be discharged (whether before or after judgment).

    Each payment of principal, interest or other sum payable on or in respect of
this Note or the indebtedness evidenced hereby shall be made by the Borrower
directly to the Agent in Dollars, for the account of the Bank, at the Agent's
Head Office, on the due date of such payment, and in immediately available and
freely transferable funds. All payments on or in respect of this Note or the
indebtedness evidenced hereby shall be made without set-off or counterclaim and
free and clear of and without any deductions, withholdings, restrictions or
conditions of any nature.

    This Note is made and delivered by the Borrower to the Bank pursuant to a
Third Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement, dated as of January __,
2003, among (i) the Borrower, (ii) the Banks party thereto and (iii) the Bank,
in its capacity as a Bank and as Agent (hereinafter, as originally executed, and
as varied, supplemented, amended and/or restated, called the "Revolving Credit
Agreement"). This Note evidences the obligations of the Borrower (a) to repay
the principal amount of the Swingline Loans made by the Bank to the Borrower
pursuant to the Revolving Credit Agreement; (b) to pay interest, as herein
provided, on the principal amount hereof remaining unpaid from time to time; and
(c) to pay other amounts which may become due and payable hereunder or
thereunder. Reference is hereby made to the Revolving Credit Agreement

thereof.

    The Borrower has the right to prepay the unpaid principal of this Note in
full or in part upon the terms contained in the Revolving Credit Agreement. The
Borrower has an obligation to prepay principal of this Note from time to time if
and to the extent required under, and upon the terms contained in, the Revolving
Credit Agreement. Any partial payment of the indebtedness evidenced by this Note
shall be applied in accordance with the terms of the Revolving Credit Agreement.

    Pursuant to and upon the terms contained in Section 14 of the Revolving
Credit Agreement, the entire unpaid principal of this Note, all of the interest
accrued on the unpaid principal of this Note and all (if any) other amounts
payable on or in respect of this Note or the indebtedness evidenced hereby may
be declared to be immediately due and payable, whereupon the entire unpaid
principal of this Note, all of the interest accrued on the unpaid principal of
this Note and all (if any) other amounts payable on or in respect of this Note
or the indebtedness evidenced hereby shall (if not already due and payable)
forthwith become and be, or the same may, as provided in said Section 14,
automatically become, due and payable to the Bank without presentment, demand,
protest or any other formalities of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly
and irrevocably

                                      A-1-2

waived by the Borrower, excepting only for notice expressly provided for in the
Revolving Credit Agreement.

    All computations of interest payable as provided in this Note shall be made
by the Agent on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed divided by 360.
The interest rate in effect from time to time shall be determined in accordance
with the terms of the Revolving Credit Agreement.

    Should all or any part of the indebtedness represented by this Note be
collected by action at law, or in bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or other
court proceedings, or should this Note be placed in the hands of attorneys for
collection after default, the Borrower hereby promises to pay to the holder of
this Note, upon demand by the holder hereof at any time, in addition to
principal, interest and all (if any) other amounts payable on or in respect of
this Note or the indebtedness evidenced hereby, all court costs and attorneys'
fees and all other collection charges and expenses reasonably incurred or
sustained by the holder of this Note.

    The Borrower hereby irrevocably waives notice of acceptance, presentment,
notice of nonpayment, protest, notice of protest, suit and all other conditions
precedent in connection with the delivery, acceptance, collection and/or
enforcement of this Note, except for notices expressly provided for in the
Revolving Credit Agreement. The Borrower hereby absolutely and irrevocably
consents and submits to the jurisdiction of the Courts of the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts sitting in Suffolk County and of any Federal Court located in the
Eastern District of Massachusetts in connection with any actions or proceedings
brought against the Borrower by the holder hereof arising out of or relating to
this Note. This Note may be executed in any number of counterparts and by each
party on a separate counterpart, each of which when so executed and delivered
shall be an original, and all of which together shall constitute one instrument.
