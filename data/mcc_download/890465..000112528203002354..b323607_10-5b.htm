      Option Plan has been established by the Company to provide a means by which
      employees, directors, and consultants of the Company and its Affiliates
      may be given the opportunity to benefit from increases in value of NPS stock
      through the granting of Options. NPS seeks to (a) retain the services of
      present employees, directors, and consultants; (b) secure and retain the
      services of new employees, directors, and consultants; and (c) provide incentives
      for such persons to exert maximum efforts for the success of the Company
      and thereby promote the long-term interest of the Company, including the
      growth in value of the Company&#8217;s equity and enhancement of long-term
      stockholder return.</font></td>
