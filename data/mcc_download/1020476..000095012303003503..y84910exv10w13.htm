</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Executive shall receive as compensation for his performance under the
attached Employment Agreement the following:
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Salary.</u> The Company shall pay the Executive a base salary during the
Term, payable in accordance with the normal payment procedures of the Company,
subject to such withholdings and other normal employee deductions as may be
required by law, at the annual rate of not less than $260,000. The Board of
Directors of the Company shall review such compensation during the Term, but
any adjustment in Executive&#146;s salary may only be upward.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Annual Bonus.</u> In addition to base salary, the Company shall pay the
Executive 15% of his annual salary as a bonus payment and such amount will be
paid in accordance with Company practice regarding when the bonus is paid and
less necessary withholdings and other deductions. The bonus payment for the
year 2002 will be paid based on the total amount of earned salary. The
Executive shall be eligible to earn further incentive compensation, up to an
additional 15% of his annual salary (excluding any other bonus payment made),
contingent upon the Company achieving its budgeted operating profit for the
fiscal year. Any such additional bonus payment would also be paid in
accordance with Company practice as described herein and may be paid in the
form of shares of stock of Kroll Inc. in accordance with a plan to be
applicable to other senior executives of the Company.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Benefits.</u> The Executive shall participate during the Term in such
pension, life insurance, health, death, disability and major medical insurance
plans, and in such other employee benefit plans and programs, for the benefit
of the employees of the Company, as may be maintained, from time to time,
during the Term, in the Company&#146;s discretion, in each case to the extent and in
the manner available to other senior employees of the Company and subject to
the terms and provisions of such plans or programs. The Company shall procure
on Executive&#146;s behalf an additional term life insurance policy so that
Executive is eligible for life insurance benefits comparable to other employees
who have been employed by the Company for at least three years (the &#147;Additional
Term Policy&#148;.) The Company&#146;s obligation to obtain the Additional Term Policy
will terminate when the Executive is otherwise eligible for such comparable
benefits. Nothing herein shall limit the Company&#146;s ability to change, modify,
cancel or amend any such employee pension, life insurance, health, death,
disability or major medical insurance plans.
