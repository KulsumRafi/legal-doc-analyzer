Per your discussions with Eric Stonestrom, I would like to confirm our intent
relative to your position and compensation. In the event our deal with DSC is
executed, we intend to offer you the position of Director, Network Management in
Airspan Communications LTD. You will initially report to Eric.

Your base salary of 70,000 (pounds) and related benefits will continue as per
the current arrangement with DSC. In the future, with your assistance, we will
implement an incentive program as a supplement to your base salary. In addition
to this cash compensation, you will be provided the option to purchase up to
150,000 shares of Airspan Communications Corporation common stock. Twenty-five
percent of this option will vest after the first full year. The remaining 75%

In addition, you will be asked to execute a Proprietary Information Agreement

employment terminates involuntarily in the first year, you will receive six
months of your base salary as severance.

Henrik, I am personally looking forward to working with you. I am excited about
the challenge, the fun and the rewards in making Airspan Communications
Corporation a success.
