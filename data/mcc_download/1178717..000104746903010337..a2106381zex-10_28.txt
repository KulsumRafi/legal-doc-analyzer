                                        2
<Page>

          (e)    all Records relating to any of the foregoing (the items listed
     above in clauses (B), (C) and (D) being referred to herein as the "RELATED
     CONTRIBUTED ASSETS".

     As used herein, "RELATED ASSETS" means the Related Purchased Assets and the
Related Contributed Assets, "PURCHASED ASSETS" means the Purchased Receivables
and the Related Purchased Assets, and "SPECIFIED ASSETS" means the Purchased
Receivables, the Contributed Receivables and the Related Assets.

     SECTION 1.2 Timing of Purchases.

     (a)  INITIAL PURCHASES. All of the Purchased Assets of each Seller that was
a party to the Original Purchase Agreement on the First Issuance Date that
existed at the closing of such Seller's business on the Initial Cut-Off Date (as
defined in the Original Purchase Agreement) were sold automatically to Buyer on
the First Issuance Date (as defined in the Original Purchase Agreement).

     (b)  REGULAR PURCHASES. Except to the extent otherwise provided in SECTION
8.2 or (with respect to any Seller) SECTION 1.8, after the closing of a Seller's
business on the Initial Cut-Off Date (as defined in the Original Purchase
Agreement) until the closing of such Seller's business on the Business Day
immediately preceding the Purchase Termination Date, all Receivables and the
Related Assets of each Seller shall be sold (or in the case of Vertis, at
Vertis' option as provided herein, contributed) automatically to Buyer pursuant
hereto immediately (and without further action by any Person) upon the creation
of the Receivable.

     SECTION 1.3 CONSIDERATION FOR PURCHASES. On the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, Buyer agrees to make Purchase Price
payments to the Sellers in accordance with ARTICLE III.

     SECTION 1.4 NO RECOURSE. Except as specifically provided in this Agreement,
the sale and purchase of Purchased Assets under this Agreement shall be without
recourse to the Sellers; IT BEING UNDERSTOOD that (i) each Seller shall be
liable to Buyer for all representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities
made by such Seller pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, all of which
obligations are limited so as not to constitute recourse to such Seller for the
credit risk of the Obligors, and (ii) Vertis shall be liable to Buyer to the
extent specified in the Seller Guaranty.

     SECTION 1.5 NO ASSUMPTION OF OBLIGATIONS RELATING TO RECEIVABLES, RELATED
ASSETS OR CONTRACTS. None of Buyer, the Servicer nor the Trustee shall have any
obligation or liability to any Obligor or other customer or client of a Seller
(including any obligation to perform any of the obligations of such Seller under
any Receivable, related Contracts or any other related purchase orders or other
agreements). No such obligation or liability is intended to be assumed by Buyer,
the Servicer or the Trustee hereunder, and any assumption is expressly
disclaimed.

     SECTION 1.6 TRUE SALES. The Sellers and Buyer intend the transfers of
Receivables hereunder to be true sales by the Sellers to Buyer that are absolute
and irrevocable and that provide Buyer with the full benefits of ownership of
the Receivables, and none of the Sellers nor Buyer intends the transactions
contemplated hereunder to be, or for any purpose to be characterized as, loans
from Buyer to any Seller.

                                        3
<Page>

     It is, further, not the intention of Buyer or any Seller that the
conveyance of the Specified Assets by such Seller be deemed a grant of a
security interest in the Specified Assets by such Seller to Buyer to secure a
debt or other obligation of such Seller. However, in the event that,
notwithstanding the intent of the parties, any Specified Assets are property of
any Seller's estate, then (i) this Agreement also shall be deemed to be and
hereby is a security agreement within the meaning of the UCC, and (ii) the
conveyance by such Seller provided for in this Agreement shall be deemed to be a
grant by such Seller to Buyer of, and such Seller hereby grants to Buyer, a
security interest in and to all of such Seller's right, title and interest in,
to and under the Specified Assets to secure (1) the rights of Buyer hereunder
and (2) a loan by Buyer to such Seller in the amount of the related Purchase
Price of the Purchased Assets sold by it or the Unpaid Balance of any
Contributed Receivables and the Related Contributed Assets, as the case may be.
Each Seller and Buyer shall, to the extent consistent with this Agreement, take
such actions as may be necessary to ensure that, if this Agreement were deemed
to create a security interest in the Specified Assets, such security interest
would be deemed to be a perfected security interest of first priority (subject
to Permitted Adverse Claims) in favor of Buyer under applicable law and will be
maintained as such throughout the term of this Agreement.

     SECTION 1.7 ADDITION OF SELLERS. Any Domestic Subsidiary of Vertis may
become a Seller hereunder and sell its accounts receivable and property of the
types that constitute Related Assets hereunder to Buyer if (x) the last sentence
of this Section applies or (y) the Modification Condition is satisfied with
respect to such addition. Vertis and such Domestic Subsidiary of Vertis that is
proposed to be added as a Seller shall give to Buyer, the Trustee and the Rating
Agencies not less than 30 days' (or such shorter number of days as is acceptable
to Trustee) prior written notice of the effective date of the addition of such
Domestic Subsidiary as a Seller. Once the notice has been given, any addition of
a Domestic Subsidiary of Vertis as a Seller pursuant to this Section shall
become effective on the first Business Day following the expiration of the
notice period (or such later date as may be specified in the notice) on which
(i) the Modification Condition has been satisfied, (ii) the Servicer shall have
delivered to the Trustee a supplement to the Monthly Report then in effect as
described in Section 3.5(e) of the Indenture and shall have confirmed in writing
to the Trustee that the Seller Guaranty covers Obligations of such Seller, and
(iii) such Domestic Subsidiary and the parties hereto shall have executed and
delivered the agreements, instruments and other documents and the amendments or
other modifications to the Transaction Documents, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Buyer and the Trustee, that Buyer or the Trustee
reasonably determines are necessary or appropriate to effect the addition. The
Modification Condition need not be satisfied as to any new Seller if (x) the new
Seller is in the same line of business as one or more existing Sellers or a
related line of business, (y) the aggregate Unpaid Balance of the new Seller's
outstanding Receivables on the last Cut-Off Date prior to the day that it
becomes a Seller is less than 5% of the aggregate Unpaid Balance of all
Receivables on such Cut-Off Date and (z) no more than two other Persons have
become Sellers during the preceding twelve months without satisfaction of the
Modification Condition (or, if no outstanding Notes are rated, written approval
of the Trustee). To the extent that Enteron may be considered a new Seller, the
Modification Condition is deemed satisfied as to Enteron.

     SECTION 1.8 TERMINATION OF STATUS AS A SELLER. (a) At any time when more
than one Person is a Seller, a Seller may terminate its obligation to sell its
Receivables and Related Assets to Buyer if:

                                        4
<Page>

          (i)    the Seller (a "TERMINATING SELLER") shall have given Buyer not
     less than 30 days' prior written notice of its intention to terminate the
     obligations, which notice shall be given by Buyer to the Trustee and the
     Rating Agencies (the date on which such notice is given being the
     "TERMINATING SELLER NOTICE DATE"),

          (ii)   an Authorized Officer of the Terminating Seller shall have
     certified that the termination by the Terminating Seller of its status as a
     Seller will not have a Material Adverse Effect,

          (iii)  both immediately before and after giving effect to the
     termination by the Terminating Seller, no Event of Default or Unmatured
     Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing or shall reasonably
     be expected to occur; and

          (iv)   either the Terminating Seller will cease to be a Domestic
     Subsidiary of Vertis concurrently with the effectiveness of such
     termination, or such Terminating Seller is a Permitted Terminating Seller;
     provided that this SUBCLAUSE (IV) may be waived by Noteholders that
     evidence more than 50% of the outstanding principal amount of the Notes if
     the Modification Condition is satisfied.

     "PERMITTED TERMINATING SELLER" means a Terminating Seller that satisfies
the following requirements:

          (x)    the aggregate Unpaid Balance of such Terminating Seller's
     Receivables on the Cut-Off Date immediately preceding the Terminating
     Seller Notice Date would not exceed 20% of the aggregate Unpaid Balance of
     all Receivables, calculated as of such Cut-Off Date, and (y) the aggregate
     Unpaid Balance of such Terminating Seller's Receivables on such Cut-Off
     Date, together with the Previously Terminated Seller Amount, would not
     exceed 25% of the sum of the Previously Terminated Seller Amount and the
     aggregate Unpaid Balance of all Receivables (calculated as of such Cut-Off
     Date).

     "PREVIOUSLY TERMINATED SELLER AMOUNT" means, on any day, the aggregate
Unpaid Balance of Receivables originated by all Sellers previously terminated
pursuant to this SUBSECTION 1.8(A), calculated with respect to any Seller as of
the Cut-Off Date immediately preceding its Terminating Seller Notice Date.

     (b)  Any termination by a Seller shall become effective on the first
Business Day that follows the day on which the requirements of CLAUSE (A) shall
have been satisfied (or such later date specified in the notice or certificate
referred to in the clauses). Any termination by a Seller shall terminate its
rights and obligations to sell Receivables and Related Assets hereunder to Buyer
and Buyer's agreement, with respect to the Terminating Seller, to purchase the
Receivables and Related Assets; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the termination shall
not relieve the Terminating Seller of any of its other Obligations, to the
extent the Obligations relate to Receivables (and Related Assets with respect
thereto) originated by the Terminating Seller prior to the effective date of the
termination.

     (c)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Seller's rights and obligations to
sell its Receivables and Related Assets to Buyer shall terminate immediately if
such Seller ceases to be

                                        5
<Page>

a Domestic Subsidiary of Vertis; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the termination shall
not relieve such Seller of any of its other Obligations, to the extent the
Obligations relate to Receivables (and Related Assets with respect thereto)
originated by such Seller prior to the effective date of the termination.

                                   ARTICLE II
                          CALCULATION OF PURCHASE PRICE

     SECTION 2.1 CALCULATION OF PURCHASE PRICE. (a) On each Business Day, the
Servicer shall deliver to Buyer, the Trustee and Vertis a Daily Report with
respect to Buyer's purchases of Receivables from the Sellers that were made on
the immediately preceding Business Day.

     (b)  On each day when Receivables are purchased by Buyer from a Seller
pursuant to ARTICLE I, the "PURCHASE PRICE" to be paid to such Seller on such
day for the Purchased Receivables and Related Purchased Assets that are to be
sold by such Seller on such day shall be determined in accordance with the
following formula:

     PP     =   AUB X PPP

     WHERE:

     PP     =   the aggregate Purchase Price for the Purchased Receivables and
                Related Purchased Assets to be purchased from such Seller on
                such day.

     AUB    =   the "Aggregate Unpaid Balance" of the Purchased Receivables
                that are to be purchased from such Seller on such day. For
                purposes of this calculation, "AGGREGATE UNPAID BALANCE" shall
                mean the sum of the Unpaid Balance of each Receivable to be
                purchased from such Seller on such day, calculated at the time
                of the Receivables sale to Buyer.

     PPP    =   the Purchase Price Percentage applicable to the Receivables to
                be purchased on such day, as determined pursuant to SECTION 2.2.

     SECTION 2.2 DEFINITIONS AND CALCULATIONS RELATED TO PURCHASE PRICE

     (a)  "PURCHASE PRICE PERCENTAGE" for the Receivables to be sold by a Seller
on any day during a Payment Period shall mean the percentage determined in
accordance with the following formula:

     PPP = 100% - (LD + PDRR)

     WHERE:

     PPP    =   the Purchase Price Percentage in effect during such Payment
                Period.

     LD     =   the Loss Discount (expressed as a percentage) in effect during
                such Payment Period, as determined pursuant to SUBSECTION (b)
                below.

                                        6

     PDRR   =   the Purchase Discount Reserve Ratio (expressed as a percentage)
                in effect during such Payment Period as determined on such day
                pursuant to SUBSECTION (c) below.

The Purchase Price Percentage, the Loss Discount and the Purchase Discount
Reserve Ratio shall be recomputed by the Servicer on each Report Date, in each
case as of the then most recent Cut-Off Date, and shall become effective on the
next Payment Date.

     (b)  "LOSS DISCOUNT" in effect during such Payment Period means a
percentage equal to the Loss to Liquidation Ratio as in effect during such
Payment Period (expressed as a percentage) as in effect on such day (it being
understood that the allocation of certain miscellaneous items will be required
to be estimated for this purpose).

     (c)  "PURCHASE DISCOUNT RESERVE RATIO" for the Receivables to be sold on
any day shall mean a percentage determined in accordance with the following
formula:

     PDRR   =   (TD/360 X DR) + PD

     WHERE:

     PDRR   =   the Purchase Discount Reserve Ratio in effect during such
                Payment Period.

     TD     =   the Turnover Days during the Calculation Period preceding the
                first day of such Payment Period.

     DR     =   the Discount Rate (expressed as a percentage) in effect during
                such Payment Period as determined pursuant to SUBSECTION (d)
                below.

     PD     =   a profit discount equal to .20%.

     (d)  "DISCOUNT RATE" for the Receivables to be sold on any day during a
Payment Period shall mean a fraction (expressed as a percentage) having (i) a

and (ii) a denominator equal to the aggregate Unpaid Balance of the Receivables
as of the last day of the Calculation Period preceding the first day of such
Payment Period.

                                  ARTICLE III
                   PAYMENT OF PURCHASE PRICE; SERVICING, ETC.

     SECTION 3.1 PURCHASE PRICE PAYMENTS. (a) On the Business Day following each
day on which any Receivables and Related Assets are purchased by Buyer pursuant
to ARTICLE I, on the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement,
Buyer shall pay to the Sellers the Purchase Price for the Receivables and
Related Assets purchased on such day by Buyer by (i) making a cash payment to
Servicer (for the account of the Sellers) to the extent that Buyer has cash
available to make the payment pursuant to SECTION 3.3 and (ii) if the Purchase
Price to be paid for the Receivables and Related Assets of any Seller exceeds
the amount of any cash

                                        7
<Page>

payment for the account of such Seller on such day pursuant to CLAUSE (i), by
(x) automatically increasing the principal amount outstanding under the relevant
Buyer Notes by the amount of the excess, provided that such increase shall not
cause the Issuer Net Worth to be less than $26,000,000, or (y) at the option of
Vertis (as evidenced by notice to Servicer), only in the case of Vertis as
Seller, such excess shall be considered to have been contributed to Buyer by
Vertis as a capital contribution.

     The obligation of Buyer to pay the Purchase Price for Receivables that has
been deferred pursuant to the preceding paragraph shall be evidenced by Buyer
Notes. Each Seller agrees that, prior to the Seller Maturity Date, Buyer shall
be required to make payments in respect of the payment obligations evidenced by
the Buyer Notes only to the extent that it has cash available under SECTION 3.3.

     (b)  On each Business Day, the "NONCOMPLYING RECEIVABLES AND DILUTION
ADJUSTMENT" shall be equal to the difference (whether the difference is positive
or negative) between (i) the sum of (A) the aggregate Seller Dilution
Adjustments in respect of all Sellers, if any, for the immediately preceding
Business Day, as shown in the Daily Report for such day, PLUS (B) the aggregate
Seller Noncomplying Receivables Adjustments in respect of all Sellers, if any,
for the immediately preceding Business Day, as shown in the Daily Report for
such day, in the case of each of CLAUSES (A) and (B), as the amounts are
determined pursuant to SECTION 3.5, MINUS (ii) the amount of the payments (if
any) that Buyer shall have received on the immediately preceding Business Day on
account of any Seller Noncomplying Receivables that had been the subject of an
earlier Seller Noncomplying Receivables Adjustment. If the Noncomplying
Receivables and Dilution Adjustment is positive on any day, Buyer shall reduce
the Purchase Price payable on such day pursuant to SUBSECTION (a) above by the
amount of the Noncomplying Receivables and Dilution Adjustment. If instead the
Noncomplying Receivables and Dilution Adjustment is negative on any day, Buyer
shall increase the Purchase Price payable pursuant to SUBSECTION (a) above on
such day by the amount of the Noncomplying Receivables and Dilution Adjustment.

     (c)  If on any day the sum of the Seller Dilution Adjustments and the
Seller Noncomplying Receivables Adjustments in respect of any Seller (as
determined pursuant to SECTION 3.5), less any amounts in CLAUSE (b)(ii)
allocated to such Seller, exceeds the Purchase Price payable by Buyer to such
Seller pursuant to SUBSECTION (a) above on such day, or if such day falls on or
after the Purchase Termination Date, then the principal amount of such Seller's
Buyer Note shall be reduced automatically by the amount of such excess.

     (d)  If, on any day prior to the Purchase Termination Date, the principal
amount of a Seller's Buyer Note is zero and such Seller is not a Terminating
Seller, then the amount of the excess of the sum of the Seller Dilution
Adjustments and the Seller Noncomplying Receivables Adjustments in respect of
such Seller (as determined pursuant to SECTION 3.5), less any amounts in CLAUSE
(b)(ii) allocated to such Seller, on such day over the Purchase Price payable by
Buyer to Servicer (for the account of such Seller) on such day pursuant to
SUBSECTION (a) above (the "PURCHASE PRICE CREDIT") shall be credited against the
Purchase Price payable by Buyer for subsequent Purchases of Receivables and
Related Assets of such Seller by Buyer. If any such Purchase Price Credit has
not been fully applied on or prior to the fifth Business Day (or a mutually
agreed upon earlier day) after the creation of such Purchase Price Credit, then,
on the

                                        8
<Page>

Business Day that follows the end of the five Business Day (or shorter) period,
such Seller shall pay to Buyer in cash the remaining unapplied amount of the
Purchase Price Credit.

     (e)  If, on any day on or after the Purchase Termination Date, or, with
respect to any Seller, the date such Seller becomes a Terminating Seller, the
principal amount of any Seller's Buyer Note has been reduced to zero, an amount
equal to the sum of any Seller Dilution Adjustments and the Seller Noncomplying
Receivables Adjustments, if any, in respect of such Seller (as determined
pursuant to SECTION 3.5), less any amounts in CLAUSE (b)(ii) allocated to such
Seller, shall be paid by such Seller to Buyer in cash on the next succeeding
Business Day.

     (f)  If, on any day, the amounts, if any, allocated to any Seller pursuant
to CLAUSE (b)(ii) above exceed the sum of any Seller Dilution Adjustments and
the Seller Noncomplying Receivables Adjustments, if any, in respect of such
Seller (as determined pursuant to SECTION 3.5) for such day, then Buyer shall
either (i) pay Servicer (for the account of such Seller) in cash the amount of
such excess, or (ii) if Buyer does not have sufficient cash to pay such amount
in full, increase the principal amount of such Seller's Buyer Note by the amount
of such excess that is not paid in cash to Servicer.

     (g)  Amounts received by Servicer pursuant to this Section shall be
allocated among the Sellers in accordance with SECTION 3.3, and the Seller
Dilution Adjustments and the Seller Noncomplying Receivables Adjustments in
respect of each such Seller (as determined pursuant to SECTION 3.5). Servicer
shall maintain a bookkeeping account (the "SELLER ACCOUNT") for purposes of
tracking:

          (i)    the Purchase Price payable to each Seller in respect of
     Receivables sold by it to Buyer (including the extent to which cash and
     non-cash payments made by Buyer should be allocated to each Seller),

          (ii)   the extent to which such Purchase Price should be reduced on
     account of such Seller's Seller Dilution Adjustments and Seller
     Noncomplying Receivables Adjustments (including any allocation of a
     Purchase Price Credit),

          (iii)  if a Seller makes cash payments in respect of the Noncomplying
     Receivables and Dilution Adjustment (including any payment in respect of a
     Purchase Price Credit), the obligation of each other Seller to reimburse
     such Seller for its proportionate share thereof,

          (iv)   if Purchase Price payments attributable to a Seller's
     Receivables have been reduced on account of another Seller's Seller
     Dilution Adjustment or the Seller Noncomplying Receivables Adjustment, the
     obligation of such other Seller to reimburse the Seller subject to such
     reduction,

          (v)    the extent to which payments (whether cash or non-cash) by
     Buyer in respect of a negative Noncomplying Receivables and Dilution
     Adjustment should be allocated to each Seller, and

          (vi)   cash payments made to and by each Seller in respect of the
     items described above.

                                        9

     Servicer shall maintain sufficient records with respect to the Seller
Account such that, on any day, it would be able to calculate each of the items
set forth above. Intercompany accounts among Sellers resulting from the items
described above will be settled in accordance with the intercompany cash
management system customarily employed by Vertis and its Subsidiaries.

     SECTION 3.2 THE BUYER NOTES. (a) On the First Issuance Date, Buyer will
deliver to each Seller a promissory note, substantially in the form of EXHIBIT
A, payable to the order of such Seller (each such promissory note, as the same
may be amended, supplemented, endorsed or otherwise modified from time to time,
together with any promissory note issued from time to time in substitution
therefor or renewal thereof in accordance with the Transaction Documents, being
herein called a "BUYER NOTE"), that is subordinated to all Senior Liabilities
now or hereafter arising under or in connection with the Indenture; such
promissory notes shall replace in their entirety the "Buyer Notes" issued by
Buyer under the Original Purchase Agreement. Each Buyer Note is payable in full
on the date that is one year and one day after the date on which all Notes have
been repaid in full and the Revolving Periods for all Notes have terminated (the
"SELLER MATURITY DATE"). Each Buyer Note bears interest at a rate per annum
equal to the rate publicly announced by the Trustee from time to time as its
"reference" rate, determined as of each Cut-Off Date. Buyer may prepay all or
part of the outstanding balance of any Buyer Note from time to time without any
premium or penalty, unless the prepayment would result in a default in Buyer's
payment of any other amount required to be paid by it under any Transaction
Document.

     (b)  Vertis (or its designee) shall hold all Buyer Notes for the benefit of
the Sellers and shall make all appropriate recordkeeping entries with respect to
the Buyer Notes or otherwise to reflect the payments on and adjustment of the
Buyer Notes. Vertis and the other Sellers shall be entitled to pledge the Buyer
Notes as collateral for the benefit of Vertis's senior lenders. Vertis's books
and records shall constitute rebuttable presumptive evidence of the principal
amount of and accrued interest on each Buyer Note at any time. Each Seller
hereby irrevocably authorizes Vertis to mark its Buyer Note "CANCELLED" and
return it to Buyer upon the final payment thereof.

     SECTION 3.3 APPLICATION OF COLLECTIONS AND OTHER FUNDS. If, on any day,
Buyer receives funds pursuant to the Indenture, Buyer shall apply the funds as
follows:

          (a)    FIRST, to pay its existing expenses and to set aside funds for
     the payment of expenses that are then accrued (in each case to the extent
     such expenses are permitted to exist under Section 7.2(l) of the
     Indenture).

          (b)    SECOND, to pay the Purchase Price pursuant to SECTION 3.1 for
     Receivables and Related Assets purchased by Buyer from the Sellers on the
     next preceding Business Day, and

          (c)    THIRD, in such order as Buyer may elect, (A) to repay amounts
     owed by Buyer to the Sellers under the Buyer Notes, (B) to pay amounts owed
     pursuant to SECTION 3.1(F), or (C) to declare and pay dividends to Vertis
     to the extent permitted by law.

     SECTION 3.4 SERVICING OF RECEIVABLES AND RELATED ASSETS. Consistent with
Buyer's ownership of the Receivables and the Related Assets, as between the
parties to this Agreement,

                                       10
<Page>

Buyer shall have the sole right to service, administer and collect the
Receivables, to assign the right and to delegate the right to others. Without
limiting the generality of SECTION 10.11, each Seller hereby acknowledges and
agrees that Buyer shall assign to the Trustee for the benefit of the Noteholders
a security interest in the rights and interests of Buyer hereunder and agrees to
cooperate fully with the Servicer and the Trustee in the exercise of the rights.
As more fully described in Section 7.4(b) and in the Indenture, the Trustee may
exercise the rights in the place of Buyer (as assignee or otherwise) only after
the designation of a Servicer other than Vertis pursuant to Section 10.2 of the
Indenture.

     At Trustee's request, each Seller will (A) assemble all of the Records that
are necessary or appropriate to collect the Receivables and Related Transferred
Assets, and shall make the same available to Trustee at one or more places
selected by Trustee or its designee, (B) segregate all cash, checks and other
instruments received by it from time to time constituting Collections in a
manner acceptable to Trustee and shall, promptly upon receipt (and in no event
later than the second Business Day following receipt), remit all such cash,
checks and instruments, duly endorsed or with duly executed instruments of
transfer, to a Bank Account or the Master Collection Account and (C) permit,
upon not less than two Business Days' prior written notice, any Successor
Servicer and its agents, employees and assignees access to their respective
facilities and their respective Records.

     SECTION 3.5 ADJUSTMENTS FOR NONCOMPLYING RECEIVABLES, DILUTION AND CASH
DISCOUNTS. (a) If at any time any of Buyer, Servicer, the Trustee or a Seller
shall determine that (i) any Receivable identified by Servicer as an Eligible
Receivable on the date of Purchase thereof by Buyer or the contribution thereof
to Buyer was in fact a Seller Noncomplying Receivable on such date, (ii) any of
the representations and warranties made by the related Seller in SECTION 5.1(k)
with respect to such Receivable was not true on such date, or (iii) the
representation and warranty made by the related Seller, in its capacity as
Sub-Servicer, in SECTION 5.3(b) with respect to such Receivable was not true on
such date, such Seller shall be deemed to have received on the date of such
determination a Collection of the Receivable in an amount equal to the Unpaid
Balance of the Receivable (the sum of all such amounts for such Seller on any
day being called the "SELLER NONCOMPLYING RECEIVABLES ADJUSTMENT" for such
Seller for such day), and such Seller Noncomplying Receivables Adjustment shall
be settled in the manner provided for in SECTION 3.1.

     (b) If on any day the aggregate Unpaid Balance of the Receivables sold or
contributed to Buyer on or before such date by a Seller is reduced in any manner
described in the definition of "Dilution" (the total of the reductions being
called the "SELLER DILUTION ADJUSTMENT" for the Seller for such day), then such
Seller shall be deemed to have received on such day a Collection of Receivables
in the amount of the Seller Dilution Adjustment and such Seller Dilution
Adjustment shall be settled in the manner provided in SECTION 3.1.

     SECTION 3.6 PAYMENTS AND COMPUTATIONS, ETC. (a) All amounts to be paid by a
Seller to Buyer hereunder shall be paid in accordance with the terms hereof no
later than 1:00 p.m., New York City time, on the day when due in Dollars in
immediately available funds to an account that Buyer shall from time to time
specify in writing. Payments received by Buyer after such time shall be deemed
to have been received on the next Business Day. In the event that any payment
becomes due on a day that is not a Business Day, then the payment shall be made
on the

                                       11
<Page>

next Business Day. Each Seller shall, to the extent permitted by law, pay to
Buyer, on demand, interest on all amounts not paid when due hereunder at 2% per
annum above the interest rate on the applicable Buyer Note in effect on the date
the payment was due; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the interest rate shall not at any
time exceed the maximum rate permitted by applicable law. All computations of
interest payable hereunder shall be made on the basis of a year of 360 days for
the actual number of days (including the first but excluding the last day)
elapsed.

     (b)  All amounts to be paid by Buyer to a Seller hereunder shall be paid to
Servicer (for the account of the applicable Seller) no later than 4:00 p.m., New
York City time, on the day when due in Dollars in immediately available funds to
an account that Vertis shall from time to time specify in writing. Payments
received by Servicer after such time shall be deemed to have been received on
the next Business Day. Servicer shall promptly remit payments received by it in
immediately available funds to such account as the applicable Seller shall from
time to time specify in writing. In the event that any payment becomes due on a
day that is not a Business Day, then such payment shall be made on the next
Business Day in accordance with the terms of the applicable Buyer Note.

SECTION 3.1) for any Purchase, title to the Receivables and the Related Assets

     of any Adverse Claim (other than any Permitted Adverse Claim or any Adverse
     Claim arising solely as a result of any action taken by Buyer hereunder or
     by the Trustee under the Indenture); and this Agreement constitutes, and
     each other Transaction Document to which such Seller is a party when duly
     executed and delivered will constitute, a legal, valid and binding

     of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at
     law.

     its properties of any court or of any federal, state, local or foreign
     regulatory body, administrative agency or other governmental
     instrumentality having jurisdiction over it or any of its properties, which
     conflict, violation, breach, default or Adverse Claim individually or in

     Material Adverse Effect.

          (f)    LITIGATION AND OTHER PROCEEDINGS. Except as described in
     SCHEDULE 1, (i) there is no action, suit, proceeding or investigation
     pending or, to the best knowledge of such Seller, threatened against it
     before any court, regulatory body, arbitrator, administrative agency or
     other tribunal or governmental instrumentality and (ii) it is not subject
     to any order, judgment, decree, injunction, stipulation or consent order of
     or with any court or other government authority that, in the case of each
     of CLAUSES (i) and (ii), (A) asserts the invalidity of this Agreement or
     any other Transaction Document, (B) seeks to prevent the sale, assignment
     or contribution of any Receivables or Related Assets by such Seller to
     Buyer, the issuance of the applicable Seller Assignment Certificate or the
     consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
     any other Transaction Document, (C) seeks any determination or ruling that

     validity or enforceability of this Agreement or any other Transaction
     Document, (D) seeks to affect adversely the income tax attributes of the
     purchases hereunder or the applicable Seller Assignment Certificate, in the

     the aggregate for all such actions, suits, proceedings and investigations
     has, or would have a substantial likelihood of having, a Material Adverse
     Effect.

     Seller's Seller Assignment Certificate or any other Transaction Document to
     which it is a party and the consummation of the transactions contemplated

     effect, except where the failure to obtain or make any such authorization,
     consent, order, approval, notice or filing, individually or in the
     aggregate for all such failures, does not, and would not reasonably be
     expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect.

          (h)    BULK SALES ACT. No transaction contemplated by this Agreement
     or any other Transaction Document requires compliance with, or will be
     subject to avoidance under, any bulk sales act or similar law.

     material adverse change in the business, operations, property, assets,
     liabilities, conditions (financial or otherwise) or prospects of Vertis and
     its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

          (j)    MARGIN REGULATIONS. No use of any funds obtained by such Seller
     under this Agreement will conflict with or contravene any of Regulations T,
     U and X promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board from time to time.

          (k)    QUALITY OF TITLE.

                 (i)    Immediately before each purchase to be made by Buyer
          hereunder and (in the case of Vertis) each contribution to be made
          hereunder to Buyer, each Receivable and Related Asset of such Seller
          that is then to be transferred to Buyer thereunder, and the related
          Contracts, shall be owned by such Seller free and clear of any Adverse
          Claim (other than any Permitted Adverse Claim or any Adverse Claim
          arising solely as the result of any action taken by Buyer hereunder or
          by the Trustee under the Indenture); and such Seller shall have made
          all filings and shall have taken all other action under applicable law
          in each relevant jurisdiction in order to protect and perfect the
          ownership interest of Buyer and its successors in the Receivables and
          Related Assets against all creditors of, and purchasers from, such
          Seller.

                 (ii)   Whenever Buyer makes a purchase hereunder from such
          Seller or (in the case of Vertis) accepts a contribution hereunder
          from such Seller, it shall have acquired a valid and perfected
          ownership interest in each Transferred Asset, free and clear of any
          Adverse Claim (other than any Permitted Adverse Claim, any Adverse
          Claim arising solely as the result of any action taken by Buyer
          hereunder or by the Trustee under the Indenture).

                 (iii)  No effective financing statement or other instrument
          similar in effect that covers all or part of any Receivable originated
          by such Seller, any interest therein or any Related Asset with respect
          thereto is on file in any recording office except such as may be filed
          (A) in favor of such Seller in accordance with the Contracts, (B) in
          favor of Buyer pursuant to this Agreement and (C) in favor of the
          Trustee, for the benefit of the Noteholders, in accordance with the
          Indenture. No effective financing statement or instrument similar in

                                       16
<Page>

          effect relating to perfection that covers any inventory of such Seller
          that might give rise to Receivables is on file in any recording office
          except for (so long as an Intercreditor Agreement is in effect)
          financing statements or instruments in favor of creditors of such
          Seller bound by such Intercreditor Agreement.

                 (iv)   No Purchase by Buyer from such Seller (and, in the case
          of Vertis, no capital contribution to Buyer whether or not made in
          connection with a Purchase) constitutes a fraudulent transfer or
          fraudulent conveyance under the United States Bankruptcy Code or
          applicable state bankruptcy or insolvency laws or is otherwise void or
          voidable or subject to subordination under similar laws or principles
          or for any other reason.

                 (v)    Each Purchase by Buyer from such Seller constitutes a
          true and valid sale of the Receivables and Related Assets under
          applicable state law and true and valid assignments and transfers for
          consideration (and not merely a pledge of the Receivables and Related
          Assets for security purposes), enforceable against the creditors of,
          and other purchasers from, such Seller, and no Receivables or Related
          Assets transferred to Buyer hereunder shall constitute property of
          such Seller.

          (l)    ELIGIBLE RECEIVABLES. On the date of each purchase of
     Receivables hereunder from such Seller (or, in the case of Vertis)
     contribution from such Seller, each such Receivable, unless otherwise
     identified to Buyer and the Trustee by the Servicer in the Daily Report for
     such date, is an Eligible Receivable.

          (m)    ACCURACY OF INFORMATION. All written information furnished by
     or on behalf of such Seller to Buyer, Servicer or the Trustee pursuant to
     or in connection with any Transaction Document or any transaction
     contemplated herein or therein shall not contain any untrue statement of a
     material fact or omit to state material facts necessary to make the
     statements made not misleading, in each case on the date the statement was
     made and in light of the circumstances under which the statements were made
     or the information was furnished.

     of all the banks, together with the account numbers of the accounts at the
     banks, into which Collections are paid as of the Issuance Date have been
     accurately identified to Buyer in a letter from such Seller to Buyer dated
     the Issuance Date or have been specified in the notices as shall have been
     delivered thereafter pursuant to SECTION 6.3(c). Each Account Bank has
     executed and delivered an Account Agreement to Buyer and the Trustee. Such
     Seller has instructed all Obligors to submit all payments on the
     Receivables and Related

                                       17

     two Business Days.

          (p)    COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS. Such Seller is in compliance
     with the requirements of all applicable laws, rules, regulations and orders
     of all Governmental Authorities (federal, state, local or foreign, and
     including environmental laws), a violation of any of which, individually or
     in the aggregate for all such violations, has, or would have a substantial
     likelihood of having a Material Adverse Effect.

          (q)    LEGAL NAMES. Except as set forth in SCHEDULE 3, since January
     1, 1997 such Seller has not been (i) known by any legal name other than its

     identity, jurisdiction of organization or corporate structure. Such Seller
     uses no trade names other than its actual corporate or company name and the
     trade names set forth in SCHEDULE 3.

          (r)    INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT. Such Seller is not, and is not
     controlled by, an "investment company" registered or required to be
     registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

          (s)    TAXES. Such Seller has filed or caused to be filed all tax
     returns and reports required by law to have been filed by it and has paid
     all taxes, assessments and governmental charges thereby shown to be owing,
     except any such taxes, assessments or charges (i) that are being diligently
     contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings, (ii) for which adequate
     reserves in accordance with GAAP shall have been set aside on its books and
     (iii) with respect to which no Adverse Claim, except Permitted Adverse
     Claims, has been imposed upon any Receivables or Related Assets.

until the Purchase Termination Date, Buyer hereby represents and warrants that
(a)(i) this Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by Buyer
and (ii) constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of Buyer,
enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, except as enforceability
may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar laws
affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and by general
principles of equity, regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a
proceeding in equity or at law, and (b) the execution, delivery and performance
of this Agreement do not violate any applicable law or any agreement to which
Buyer is a party or by which its properties are bound.

     SECTION 5.3 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SERVICER. In order to induce
Buyer to enter into this Agreement and to make purchases hereunder:

          (a)    Servicer and each Seller, in its capacity as a Sub-Servicer,
     hereby represents and warrants as to itself that all information furnished
     by or on behalf of such Person to Buyer, Servicer or the Trustee pursuant
     to or in connection with any Transaction Document or any transaction
     contemplated herein or therein shall not contain any untrue statement of a
     material fact or omit to state material facts necessary to make

                                       18
<Page>

     the statements made not misleading, in each case on the date the statement
     was made and in light of the circumstances under which the statements were
     made or the information was furnished; and

          (b)    without limiting the foregoing, each Seller, in its capacity as
     a Sub-Servicer, hereby represents and warrants as to itself that on the
     date of each Daily Report or Monthly Report that identifies a Receivable
     originated by such Seller as an Eligible Receivable, such Receivable is an
     Eligible Receivable.

                                   ARTICLE VI
                        GENERAL COVENANTS OF THE SELLERS

     SECTION 6.1 AFFIRMATIVE COVENANTS. From the First Issuance Date until the
first day following the Purchase Termination Date on which all Obligations of
the Sellers shall have been finally and fully paid and performed and the
Principal Amount of the Notes shall have been reduced to zero, unless Buyer
shall otherwise give its prior written consent, each Seller hereby agrees that
it will perform the covenants and agreements set forth in this Section.

          (a)    COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS, ETC. Such Seller will comply in all
     material respects with all applicable laws, rules, regulations, judgments,
     decrees and orders (including those relating to the Receivables, the
     Related Assets, the related Contracts of such Seller and any other
     agreements related thereto), in each case to the extent the failure to
     comply, individually or in the aggregate for all such failures, has, or
     would have a substantial likelihood of having, a Material Adverse Effect.

          (b)    PRESERVATION OF EXISTENCE. Such Seller will preserve and
     maintain its corporate or limited liability company existence, rights,
     franchises and privileges in the jurisdiction of its incorporation, and
     qualify and remain qualified in good standing as a foreign corporation or
     limited liability company in each jurisdiction where the failure to
     preserve and maintain such existence, rights, franchises, privileges and
     qualifications has, or would have a substantial likelihood of having, a
     Material Adverse Effect.

          (c)    RECEIVABLES REVIEWS. Such Seller shall, during regular business
     hours, permit Buyer and its agents or representatives, at the expense of
     such Seller, (i) to examine and make copies of and abstracts from, and to
     conduct accounting reviews of, all Records in the possession or under the
     control of such Seller relating to the Receivables or Related Assets
     generated by such Seller, and (ii) to visit the offices and properties of
     such Seller for the purpose of examining the materials described in CLAUSE
     (i) above, and to discuss matters relating to any Receivables or any
     Related Assets of such Seller or such Seller's performance hereunder with
     any of the Authorized Officers of such Seller or, with the prior consent of
     an Authorized Officer of such Seller, with employees of such Seller having
     knowledge of such matters (the examinations set forth in the foregoing
     CLAUSES (i) and (ii) being herein called a "SELLER RECEIVABLES REVIEW").
     Buyer and its agents or representatives shall be entitled to conduct Seller
     Receivables Reviews whenever Buyer, in its reasonable judgment, deems it
     appropriate; PROVIDED, that prior to the occurrence and continuance of an
     Event of Default, Buyer (or its agent or representative) shall give such
     Seller at least five Business Days' prior notice of any

                                       19
<Page>

     Seller Receivables Review, and Buyer shall have the right to request a
     Seller Receivables Review not more than once in any calendar year.

          (d)    KEEPING OF RECORDS AND BOOKS OF ACCOUNT. Such Seller shall
     maintain and implement administrative and operating procedures (including
     an ability to recreate records evidencing its Receivables and Related
     Assets in the event of the destruction of the originals thereof), and shall
     keep and maintain all documents, books, records and other information that,
     in the reasonable determination of Buyer and the Trustee, are necessary or
     advisable in accordance with prudent industry practice and custom for
     transactions of this type for the collection of all Receivables and the
     Related Assets. Upon the reasonable request of Buyer to Seller (with a copy
     to the Trustee) made at any time after the occurrence and continuance of a
     Servicer Default, such Seller will deliver copies of all books and records
     maintained pursuant to this subsection to the Trustee. Such Seller shall
     maintain at all times accurate and complete books, records and accounts
     relating to the Receivables, Related Assets and Contracts and all
     Collections thereon in which timely entries shall be made. Such books and
     records shall be marked to indicate the sales of all Receivables and
     Related Assets hereunder and shall include (i) all payments received and
     all credits and extensions granted with respect to the Receivables and (ii)
     the return, rejection, repossession, or stoppage in transit of any
     merchandise, the sale of which has given rise to a Receivable that has been
     purchased by or contributed to Buyer.

          (e)    PERFORMANCE AND COMPLIANCE WITH RECEIVABLES AND CONTRACTS. Such
     Seller will, at its expense, timely and fully perform and comply with all
     provisions, covenants and other promises required to be observed by it
     under the Contracts of such Seller related to the Receivables and Related
     Assets, in each case to the extent failure to perform or comply has, or
     would have a substantial likelihood of having, a Material Adverse Effect.

          (f)    LOCATION OF RECORDS AND OFFICES. Such Seller will keep its
     principal place of business and chief executive office at the addresses
     referred to in SCHEDULE 2 or, upon not less than 30 days' prior written
     notice given by such Seller to Buyer, the Trustee, the Agents and the
     Rating Agencies, at such other locations in jurisdictions where all action
     required by SECTION 7.3 shall have been taken and completed.

          (g)    CREDIT AND COLLECTION POLICIES. Such Seller will comply in all
     material respects with its Credit and Collection Policy in regard to each
     Receivable of such Seller and the Related Assets and the Contracts related
     to each such Receivable, where the failure so to comply, individually or in
     the aggregate for all such failures, has, or would have a substantial
     likelihood of having, a Material Adverse Effect.

          (h)    SEPARATE CORPORATE EXISTENCE OF BUYER. Such Seller hereby
     acknowledges that the Trustee, on behalf of the Noteholders and the
     Indemnified Parties, is entering into the transactions contemplated by the
     Transaction Documents in reliance upon Buyer's identity as a legal entity
     separate from such Seller and the other Vertis Persons. Therefore, from and
     after the date hereof until the first day following the Purchase
     Termination Date on which all Obligations shall have been fully paid and
     performed and

                                       20
<Page>

     the Principal Amount of the Notes shall have been reduced to zero, such
     Seller will, and will cause each other Vertis Person to, take all
     reasonable steps to continue their respective identities as separate legal
     entities and to make it apparent to third Persons that each is an entity
     with assets and liabilities distinct from those of Buyer and that Buyer is
     not a division of the Servicer, such Seller, Vertis or any other Person.
     Without limiting the foregoing, Vertis and each other Seller will, and will
     cause each other Vertis Person to, operate, conduct their respective
     businesses and otherwise act in a manner which is consistent with the
     factual assumptions in each of the opinions of Piper Rudnick LLP dated the
     date hereof regarding certain substantive consolidation and true sale
     issues.

          (i)    PAYMENT INSTRUCTIONS TO OBLIGORS. Such Seller will instruct all
     Obligors to submit all payments either (i) to one of the lockboxes
     maintained at the Lockbox Banks for deposit in a Lockbox Account or to a
     Concentration Account or (ii) directly to one of the Lockbox Accounts.

          (j)    SEGREGATION OF COLLECTIONS. Such Seller shall use reasonable
     efforts to minimize the deposit of any funds other than Collections into
     any of the Lockbox Accounts and, to the extent that any such funds
     nevertheless are deposited into any of the Lockbox Accounts, shall promptly
     identify any such funds, or shall cause the funds to be so identified, to
     Buyer, the Servicer and the Trustee (following which notice, Buyer shall
     cause the Servicer to return all the funds to such Seller).

          (k)    IDENTIFICATION OF ELIGIBLE RECEIVABLES. Such Seller will (i)
     establish and maintain such procedures as are necessary for determining no
     less frequently than each Business Day whether each Receivable qualifies as
     an Eligible Receivable, and for identifying, on any Business Day, all
     Receivables to be sold on that date that are not Eligible Receivables, and
     (ii) except as permitted in Section 3.5(c) of the Indenture, notify Buyer
     prior to the occurrence of a Purchase if a Receivable to be sold hereunder
     will, to such Seller's knowledge, not be an Eligible Receivable as of the
     date of Purchase.

          (l)    ACCURACY OF INFORMATION. All written information furnished on
     and after the Issuance Date by or on behalf of such Seller to Buyer, the
     Servicer or the Trustee pursuant to or in connection with any Transaction
     Document or any transaction contemplated herein or therein shall not
     contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state material
     facts necessary to make the statements made not misleading, in each case on
     the date the statement was made and in light of the circumstances under
     which the statements were made or the information was furnished.

          (m)    TAXES. File or cause to be filed, and cause each Person with
     whom it shares consolidated tax liability to file, all Federal, state and
     local tax returns that are required to be filed by it (except where the
     failure to file such returns does not have a substantial likelihood of
     having, a Material Adverse Effect) and pay or cause to be paid all taxes
     shown to be due and payable on such tax returns (except only such taxes or
     assessments the validity of which are being contested in good faith by
     appropriate proceedings and with respect to which such Seller shall have
     set aside adequate reserves on its books in accordance with GAAP and which
     proceedings do not have a substantial likelihood of having, a Material
     Adverse Effect).

                                       21

          (n)    SOFTWARE LICENSES. Upon the renewal of or entry into any new
     software license or similar agreement used by the Sellers or Servicer in
     the origination or servicing of Receivables such Seller or the Servicer, as
     applicable, shall use its commercially reasonable best efforts to expressly
     permit use by any substitute Servicer of the materials subject to such
     licenses or agreements.

     SECTION 6.2 REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. From the Issuance Date until the first
day following the Purchase Termination Date on which all Obligations of the
Sellers shall have been finally and fully paid and performed and the Principal
Amount of the Notes shall have been reduced to zero, such Seller agrees that it
will, unless Buyer and the Trustee shall otherwise give prior written consent,
and (with respect to the notices described below in SUBSECTIONS (c) and (d),
unless the Modification Condition has been satisfied), furnish to Buyer, the
Agents, the Trustee and each Noteholder (and in the case of the notices
described below in SUBSECTIONS (c), (d) and (f), to the Rating Agencies):

     related unaudited statements of earnings and cash flows, in each case for
     the fiscal quarter and for the period from the beginning of the fiscal year
     through the end of such fiscal quarter, prepared in accordance with GAAP
     consistently applied throughout the periods reflected therein and certified

     of Buyer, the Trustee or the Noteholders under or as contemplated by this
     Agreement.

     SECTION 6.3 NEGATIVE COVENANTS. From the Issuance Date until the first day
following the Purchase Termination Date on which all Obligations of the Sellers
shall have been finally and fully paid and performed and the Principal Amount of
the Notes shall have been reduced to zero, unless Buyer shall otherwise give its
prior written consent, each Seller hereby agrees that it will perform the
covenants and agreements set forth in this Section.

          (a)    SALES, LIENS, ETC. Except as otherwise provided herein or in
     the Indenture, such Seller will not (i)(A) sell, assign (by operation of
     law or otherwise) or otherwise transfer to any Person, (B) pledge any
     interest in, (C) grant, create, incur, assume or permit to exist any
     Adverse Claim (other than Permitted Adverse Claims) to or in favor of any
     Person upon or with respect to, or (D) cause to be filed any financing
     statement or equivalent document relating to perfection with respect to any
     Transferred Asset or any Contract related to any Receivable, or upon or
     with respect to any lockbox or account to which any Collections of any such
     Receivable or any Related Assets are sent or any interest therein, or (ii)
     assign to any Person any right to receive income from or in respect of any
     of the foregoing.

          In the event that such Seller fails to keep any Specified Assets free
     and clear of any Adverse Claim (other than a Permitted Adverse Claim, any
     Adverse Claims arising hereunder, and other Adverse Claims permitted by any
     other Transaction Document), Buyer may (without limiting its other rights
     with respect to such Seller's breach of its obligations hereunder) make
     reasonable expenditures necessary to release the Adverse Claim. Buyer shall
     be entitled to indemnification for any such expenditures pursuant to the
     indemnification provisions of ARTICLE IX. Alternatively, Buyer may deduct
     such expenditures as an offset to the Purchase Price owed to such Seller
     hereunder.

          Such Seller will not pledge or grant any security interest in its
     inventory, the Buyer Note or the capital stock of Buyer unless prior to any
     pledge or grant such Seller and the Person for whose benefits the pledge or
     grant is being made have entered into an Intercreditor Agreement; PROVIDED,
     HOWEVER, that any Buyer Note and/or the capital stock or membership
     interests of Buyer may be pledged pursuant to the Vertis Credit Agreement.

          (b)    EXTENSION OR AMENDMENT OF RECEIVABLES; CHANGE IN CREDIT AND
     COLLECTION POLICY OR CONTRACTS. Such Seller will not, (i) without the prior
     written consent of Buyer and the Trustee, which consent will not be
     unreasonably withheld, extend, amend or otherwise modify the terms of any
     Receivable or Contract in a manner that would have a substantial likelihood
     of having a Material Adverse Effect or (ii) change the terms and provisions
     of the Credit and Collection Policy in any material respect unless (x) with
     respect to collection policies, the change is made with the prior written
     approval of the Trustee and Buyer and the Modification Condition is
     satisfied with respect thereto, (y) with respect to collection procedures,
     the change is made with prior written notice to the Trustee and Buyer and
     no Material Adverse Effect would result and (z) with respect to accounting
     policies relating to Receivables that have become Write-Offs, the change is
     made in accordance with GAAP.

          (c)    CHANGE IN PAYMENT INSTRUCTIONS TO OBLIGORS. Such Seller will
     not (i) add or terminate any bank as an Account Bank from those listed in
     the letter referred to in SECTION 5.1(o) unless, prior to any such addition
     or termination, Buyer, the Trustee, the Agents and the Rating Agencies
     shall have received not less than ten Business Days' prior written notice
     of the addition or termination and, not less than ten Business Days prior
     to the effective date of any such proposed addition or termination, Buyer
     and the Trustee shall have received (A) counterparts of the applicable type
     of Account Agreement with each new Account Bank, duly executed by such new
     Account Bank and all other parties thereto and (B) copies of all other
     agreements and documents signed by the Account Bank and such other parties
     with respect to any new Bank Account, all of which agreements and documents
     shall be reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to Buyer and the
     Trustee, or (ii) make any change in its instructions to Obligors, given in
     accordance with SECTION 5.1(o), regarding payments to be made to such
     Seller or payments to be made to any Account Bank, other than changes in
     the instructions that direct Obligors to make payments to another Bank
     Account at such Account Bank or another Account Bank or to the Master
     Collection Account.

          (d)    MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS, SALES, ETC. Except for (i) mergers or
     consolidations in which such Seller is the surviving Person, (ii) mergers
     or consolidations of a Subsidiary of Vertis into such Seller or (iii)
     mergers or consolidations in which the surviving Person expressly assumes
     the performance of this Agreement and the Modification Condition shall have
     been satisfied with respect to the consolidation or merger, the Seller will
     not be a constituent corporation to any merger or consolidation. Such
     Seller will give the Rating Agencies, the Agents and the Trustee notice of
     any such permitted merger or consolidation promptly following completion
     thereof. Unless the Modification Condition is satisfied, such Seller will
     not, directly or indirectly, transfer, assign, convey or lease, whether in
     one transaction or in a series of transactions, all or substantially all of
     its assets or sell or assign, with or without recourse, any Receivables or
     Related Assets, in each case other than pursuant to this Agreement.

          (e)    CHANGE IN NAME. Such Seller will not change (A) (i) its
     legal name or (ii) the name under or by which it does business, in either
     case, in any manner that would or may make any financing statement filed by
     such Seller in accordance herewith seriously misleading within the meaning
     of Section 9-507(c) of an applicable enactment of the

                                       24
<Page>

     UCC or (B) its jurisdiction of organization or legal structure, in each
     case unless such Seller shall have given Buyer, the Servicer, the Trustee
     and the Rating Agencies 30 days' prior written notice thereof and unless,
     prior to any change in name, such Seller shall have taken and completed all
     action required by SECTION 7.3.

          (f)    OPERATING AGREEMENT. Such Seller will not cause Buyer to amend
     Section 1.2, 1.4, 1.6, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.6, 3.1B, 4.1.A, 4.3, 5.1, 6.1, 8.4,
     and 8.6 nor any of the provisions of Article IX of its limited liability
     company operating agreement without the Trustee's prior written consent,
     which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

          (g)    AMENDMENTS TO TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS. Such Seller will not amend
     or otherwise modify or supplement any Transaction Document to which it is a
     party unless (i) Buyer shall have given its prior written consent to each

     shall have been satisfied.

          (h)    ACCOUNTING FOR PURCHASES. Such Seller shall prepare its
     financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and any financial statements
     that are made publicly available and which are consolidated to include
     Buyer will contain footnotes stating that such Seller has sold or
     contributed its Receivables to Buyer and that the assets of Buyer will not
     be available to Vertis and its Subsidiaries unless Buyer's liabilities have
     been paid in full. Such Seller shall not prepare any financial statements
     that account for the transactions contemplated in this Agreement in any
     manner other than as a sale of the Purchased Assets by such Seller to
     Buyer, or in any other respect account for or treat the transactions
     contemplated in this Agreement (including but not limited to accounting
     and, where taxes are not consolidated, for tax reporting purposes) in any
     manner other than as a sale of the Purchased Assets by such Seller to
     Buyer.

          (i)    AMENDMENTS TO INTERCREDITOR PROVISIONS. Such Seller will not
     amend, waive, modify or breach the Intercreditor Provisions in a manner
     that has, or would have a substantial likelihood of having, a Material
     Adverse Effect.

                                   ARTICLE VII
                      ADDITIONAL RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS IN
                         RESPECT OF THE SPECIFIED ASSETS

     SECTION 7.1 RIGHTS OF BUYER. (a) Subject to SECTION 7.4(b), each Seller
hereby authorizes Buyer, the Servicer and/or their respective designees to take

<Page>

finance charge collected pursuant thereto, to any Seller, irrespective of
whether such Collections and charges are in excess of the Purchase Price for the
Purchased Assets.

     (c)  Buyer shall have the unrestricted right to further assign, transfer,
deliver, hypothecate, subdivide or otherwise deal with the Specified Assets, and
all of Buyer's right, title and interest in, to and under this Agreement, on

contrary notwithstanding, each Seller hereby agrees:

          (a)    to deliver directly to the Servicer (for Buyer's account),
     within two Business Days after receipt thereof, any Collections that it
     receives, in the form so received, and agrees that all such Collections
     shall be deemed to be received in trust for Buyer and shall be maintained
     and segregated separate and apart from all other funds and moneys of such
     Seller until delivery of such Collections to the Servicer; PROVIDED,
     HOWEVER, that until the obligations of the Issuer under the Indenture are
     terminated pursuant to Section 12.1 thereof, Buyer hereby directs each
     Seller and each Seller hereby agrees, to make any delivery of Collections

          (b)    to perform all of its obligations hereunder and under the
     Contracts related to the Receivables and Related Assets to the same extent
     as if the Receivables had not been sold hereunder, and the exercise by
     Buyer or its designee or assignee of Buyer's rights hereunder or in
     connection herewith shall not relieve such Seller from any of its
     obligations under the Contracts or Related Assets related to the
     Receivables,

          (c)    that it hereby grants to Buyer an irrevocable power of
     attorney, with full power of substitution, coupled with an interest, to

     Asset, and

          (d)    upon the occurrence of a Servicer Default, to the extent that
     such Seller does not own the computer software that such Seller uses to
     account for Receivables, such Seller shall use its commercially reasonable
     best efforts to provide any substitute Servicer and the Trustee with such
     licenses, sublicenses and/or assignments of contracts as any substitute
     Servicer or the Trustee shall require with regard to all services and
     computer hardware or software used by such Seller that relate to the
     servicing of the Specified Assets.

     SECTION 7.3 FURTHER ACTION EVIDENCING PURCHASES. Each Seller agrees that
from time to time, at its expense, it will promptly, upon reasonable request by
Buyer, Servicer or Trustee, execute and deliver all further instruments and

evidence the purchase or contribution of the Receivables and the Related Assets
or to enable Buyer or the Trustee (as the assignee of Buyer) to exercise or
enforce any of its rights hereunder or under any other Transaction Document.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, on or prior to the Issuance
Date, and with respect to any Person who becomes a Seller pursuant to SECTION
1.7, on or prior to the effective date of such Person becoming a Seller, each
Seller will:

          (a)    execute (to the extent required by applicable law) and file
     such financing or continuation statements, or amendments thereto or
     assignments thereof, and such other instruments or notices, as Buyer or the
     Trustee may reasonably determine to be necessary or appropriate, and

          (b)    mark the master data processing records evidencing Receivables
     with the following legend:

          THE RECEIVABLES DESCRIBED HEREIN HAVE BEEN SOLD TO VERTIS RECEIVABLES,
          LLC ("VR") PURSUANT TO AN AMENDED AND RESTATED RECEIVABLES PURCHASE
          AGREEMENT, DATED AS OF DECEMBER 9, 2002, AMONG VERTIS, INC.
          ("VERTIS"), CERTAIN SUBSIDIARIES OF VERTIS AS SELLERS, VERTIS, AS
          SERVICER, AND VR, AS BUYER; AND A SECURITY INTEREST IN SUCH
          RECEIVABLES HAS BEEN GRANTED TO THE TRUSTEE PURSUANT TO AN AMENDED AND
          RESTATED INDENTURE AND SERVICING AGREEMENT, DATED AS OF DECEMBER 9,
          2002, AMONG VR, AS ISSUER, VERTIS, AS SERVICER, AND MANUFACTURERS AND
          TRADERS TRUST COMPANY, AS TRUSTEE."

     Each Seller hereby authorizes Buyer or its designee to file one or more
financing or continuation statements, and amendments thereto and assignments
thereof, relative to all or any of the Receivables and Related Assets of such
Seller, in each case whether now existing or hereafter generated by such Seller,
without the signature of such Seller. Except for material performance
obligations of such Seller to any Obligor hereunder or under any of the
Contracts, if (i) such Seller fails to perform any of its agreements or
obligations under this Agreement and does not remedy the failure within the
applicable cure period, if any, and (ii) Buyer in good faith reasonably believes
that the performance of such agreements and obligations is necessary or
appropriate to protect its interests under this Agreement, then Buyer or its
designee may (but shall not be required to) perform, or cause performance of,
such agreement or obligation and the reasonable expenses of Buyer or its
designee or assignee incurred in connection with such performance shall be
payable by such Seller as provided in SECTION 9.1.

     SECTION 7.4 COLLECTION OF RECEIVABLES; RIGHTS OF BUYER AND ITS ASSIGNEES.
(a) Each Seller hereby transfers to the Trustee (as transferee of Buyer's
interest in the Specified Assets)

                                       27
<Page>

the ownership of, and the exclusive dominion and control over, each of the Bank
Accounts and all related lockboxes owned by such Seller, and such Seller hereby
agrees to take any further action that Buyer or the Trustee may reasonably
request in order to effect or complete the transfer. Each Seller further agrees
to use reasonable efforts to prevent funds other than proceeds of the Specified
Assets from being deposited in any Bank Account.

     (b)  Buyer may, at any time after an Event of Default or Servicer Default,
direct the Obligors of Receivables, or any of them, to pay all amounts payable
under any Transferred Asset directly to the Trustee or its designees.
Furthermore, each Seller shall, at the request of Buyer and at such Seller's
expense, promptly give notice of the Trustee's security interest in the
Receivables of the Obligor and the Related Assets to each such Obligor and
direct that payments be made directly to the Trustee or its designee, which
notice shall be acceptable in form and substance to Buyer. In addition, each
Seller hereby authorizes Buyer to take any and all steps in such Seller's name
and on its behalf that are necessary or desirable, in the reasonable
determination of Buyer, to collect all amounts due under any and all Specified
Assets, including endorsing such Seller's name on checks and other instruments
representing Collections and enforcing the Specified Assets and the Contracts
related to the Receivables. The Trustee may exercise any of the foregoing rights
in the place of Buyer (as assignee or otherwise) at any time following the
designation of a Servicer other than Vertis pursuant to Section 10.2 of the
Indenture.

     (c)  At any time when (i) an Event of Default shall have occurred and
remain continuing or (ii) a Servicer other than Vertis has been designated
pursuant to Section 10.2 of the Indenture, each Seller shall, at Buyer's
request, assemble all of the Records that evidence the Receivables and Related
Assets originated by such Seller and the Contracts related to the Receivables,
or that are otherwise necessary or desirable to collect the Receivables or
Related Assets, and make the same available to Buyer or the Trustee at a place
selected by the Trustee or its designee.

                                  ARTICLE VIII
                                   TERMINATION

     SECTION 8.1 TERMINATION BY THE SELLERS. Prior to the commencement of an
Amortization Period, if Buyer is unable to pay the Purchase Price for the
Receivables in accordance with SECTION 3.1, the Sellers may terminate all of
their agreements to sell Receivables hereunder to Buyer by giving Buyer and the
Trustee not less than thirty days' prior written notice of their election not to
continue to sell Receivables to Buyer; PROVIDED that such notice must be given
as to all Sellers and PROVIDED FURTHER, that such notice shall specify the
effective date of termination. The Trustee shall notify the Noteholders within
five Business Days of receiving any such termination notice.

     SECTION 8.2 AUTOMATIC TERMINATION. (a) The agreement of each Seller to sell
Receivables hereunder, and the agreement of Buyer to purchase Receivables from
such Seller hereunder, shall terminate automatically upon the first date on
which an Amortization Period occurs; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if, at any time
prior to such date, an event specified in the definition of Bankruptcy Event
occurs (without regard to the 60 day grace period specified in paragraph (a) of
that definition) as a result of a bankruptcy proceeding being filed against a

                                       28
<Page>

Seller, then on and after the date on which such bankruptcy proceeding is filed
until the dismissal of the proceeding Buyer shall not purchase Receivables and
Related Assets from such Seller.

     (b)  If the Internal Revenue Service or the PBGC files one or more Tax or
ERISA Liens against the assets (including Receivables) of the Issuer or any
Seller, then in each case, Buyer shall not purchase any Receivables or Related
Assets from such Seller (or from any Seller if such Lien is filed against
Issuer).

                                   ARTICLE IX
                                 INDEMNIFICATION

     SECTION 9.1 INDEMNITIES BY THE SELLERS. Without limiting any other rights
that any RPA Indemnified Party (as defined below) may have hereunder or under
applicable law, each Seller agrees to indemnify Buyer, each of its successors,
permitted transferees and assigns, and all officers, directors, shareholders,
controlling Persons, employees and agents of any of the foregoing (each of the
foregoing Persons being individually called a "RPA INDEMNIFIED PARTY"),
forthwith on demand from and against any and all damages, losses, claims
(whether on account of settlements or otherwise), judgments, liabilities and
related reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and
disbursements) awarded against or incurred by any of them arising out of or as a
result of any of the following (all of the foregoing being collectively called
"RPA INDEMNIFIED LOSSES"):

          (a)    any representation or warranty made in writing by such Seller
     (or any of its Authorized Officers) under any of the Transaction Documents,
     any Monthly Report, any Daily Report or any other information or report
     delivered by or on behalf of such Seller or the Servicer with respect to
     such Seller or the Receivables or Related Assets originated by such Seller
     (including without limitation any representation, warranty, information or
     report relied upon by Buyer in connection with the offering or sale of any
     Note), that contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to
     state material facts necessary to make the statements not misleading when
     made,

          (b)    the failure by such Seller to comply with any applicable law,
     rule or regulation with respect to any Receivable or any Related Asset or
     to comply with any Contract related thereto, or the nonconformity of any
     Receivable, the related Contract or any Related Assets with any such
     applicable law, rule or regulation,

          (c)    the failure to vest and maintain vested in Buyer a perfected
     ownership interest in the Receivables originated by such Seller, the
     Related Assets, the related Collections and the proceeds of each of the
     foregoing, free and clear of any Adverse Claim (other than an Adverse Claim
     created in favor of Buyer pursuant to this Agreement or in favor of the
     Trustee pursuant to the Indenture or the Original Agreement), whether
     existing at the time of the sale of such Receivable or at any time
     thereafter and without regard to whether such Adverse Claim was a Permitted
     Adverse Claim,

          (d)    any failure of such Seller to perform its duties or obligations
     in accordance with the provisions of the Transaction Documents,

                                       29
<Page>

          (e)    any products liability claim, personal injury or property
     damage suit, environmental liability claim or any other claim or action by
     a party other than Buyer of whatever sort, whether sounding in tort,
     contract or any other legal theory, arising out of or in connection with
     the goods or services that are the subject of any Specified Assets with
     respect thereto or Collections thereof,

          (f)    the failure to file, or any delay in filing, financing
     statements or other similar instruments or documents under the UCC of any
     applicable jurisdiction or other applicable laws with respect to any
     Specified Assets or Collections, whether at the time of any sale or at any
     subsequent time,

          (g)    any dispute, claim, offset or defense (other than the discharge
     in bankruptcy) of an Obligor to the payment of any Receivable originated by
     such Seller or Related Asset, or purported Receivable or Related Asset,
     including a defense based on such Receivables or the related Contract's not
     being a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Obligor enforceable
     against it in accordance with its terms, and

          (h) any tax or governmental fee or charge (other than franchise taxes
     and taxes on or measured by the net income of Buyer or any of its
     assignees), all interest and penalties thereon or with respect thereto, and
     all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses, including the reasonable
     fees and expenses of counsel in defending against the same, that may arise
     by reason of the purchase or ownership of the Receivables originated by
     such Seller or any Related Asset connected with any such Receivables.

Notwithstanding the foregoing (and with respect to CLAUSE (ii) below, without
prejudice to the rights that Buyer may have pursuant to the other provisions of
this Agreement or the provisions of any of the other Transaction Documents), in
no event shall any RPA Indemnified Party be indemnified for any RPA Indemnified
Losses (i) resulting from gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of
the RPA Indemnified Party, (ii) to the extent the same includes losses in
respect of Receivables and reimbursement therefor that would constitute credit
recourse to such Seller for the amount of any Receivable or Related Asset not
paid by the related Obligor, (iii) resulting from the action or omission of the
Servicer (unless the Servicer is a Vertis Person), (iv) to the extent the same
are or result from lost profits, (v) to the extent the same are or result from
taxes on or measured by the net income of the RPA Indemnified Party and (vi) to
the extent the same constitute consequential, special or punitive damages.

     If for any reason the indemnification provided above in this Section is
unavailable to a RPA Indemnified Party or is insufficient to hold a RPA
Indemnified Party harmless, then such Seller shall contribute to the maximum
amount payable or paid to the RPA Indemnified Party as a result of the loss,
claim, damage or liability in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not
only the relative benefits received by the RPA Indemnified Party on the one hand
and such Seller on the other hand, but also the relative fault of the RPA
Indemnified Party (if any) and such Seller and any other relevant equitable
considerations.

respect to an amendment) or by Buyer (with respect to a waiver or consent by it)
and, in the case of any amendment, modification or waiver, to the extent
provided in Section 7.2(j) of the Indenture, by the Trustee, and then any such
waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the
specific purpose for which given. If any outstanding Notes have been rated, this

thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such power or right
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
power or right. No notice to or demand on any Seller in any case shall entitle
it to any notice or demand in similar or other circumstances. No waiver or
approval by Buyer or the Trustee under this Agreement shall, except as may
otherwise be stated in the waiver or approval, be applicable to subsequent
transactions. No waiver or approval under this Agreement shall require any
similar or dissimilar waiver or approval thereafter to be granted hereunder.

for hereunder shall, unless otherwise stated herein, be in writing (including
facsimile communication) and shall be personally delivered or sent by certified

otherwise in the Transaction Documents, the obligations of Buyer under the
Transaction Documents to which it is a party are solely the obligations of
Buyer. No recourse shall be had for payment of any fee payable by or other

     7. SUBORDINATION PROVISIONS. Buyer covenants and agrees, and the Holder, by

all Junior Liabilities is hereby expressly subordinated in right of payment to
the payment and performance of the Senior Liabilities to the extent and in the
manner set forth in this paragraph:

          (a) In the event of any Bankruptcy Proceeding, the Senior Liabilities
     shall first be paid and performed in full and in cash before the Holder
     shall be entitled to receive and to retain any payment or distribution in
     respect of the Junior Liabilities. In order to implement the foregoing: (i)
     all payments and distributions of any kind or character in respect of the
     Junior Liabilities to which the Holder would be entitled except for this
     CLAUSE (a) shall be made directly to the Trustee (for the benefit of itself
     and the Noteholders), and (ii) if a Bankruptcy Proceeding has been
     commenced, the Holder shall promptly file a claim or claims, in the form
     required in any Bankruptcy Proceedings, for the full outstanding amount of
     the Junior Liabilities, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
     cause said claim or claims to be approved and all payments and other
     distributions in respect thereof to be made directly to the Trustee (for
     the benefit of itself and the Noteholders) until the Senior Liabilities
     shall have been paid and performed in full and in cash.

          (b) In the event that the Holder receives any payment or other
     distribution of any kind or character from Buyer or from any other source
     whatsoever, in payment of the Junior Liabilities, after the commencement of
     any Bankruptcy Proceeding, such payment or other distribution shall be
     received in trust for the Trustee and the Noteholders and shall be turned
     over by the Holder to the Trustee forthwith.

          (c) Upon the final indefeasible payment in full and in cash of all
     Senior Liabilities, the Holder shall be subrogated to the rights of the
     Trustee and the Noteholders to receive payments or distributions from Buyer
     that are applicable to the Senior Liabilities until the Junior Liabilities
     are paid in full.

          (d) These Subordination Provisions are intended solely for the purpose
     of defining the relative rights of the Holder, on the one hand, and the
     Trustee and the Noteholders on the other hand. Nothing contained in these
     Subordination Provisions or elsewhere in this Note is intended to or shall
     impair, as between Buyer, its creditors (other than the Trustee and the
     Noteholders) and the Holder, Buyer's obligation, which is unconditional and
     absolute, to pay the Junior Liabilities as and when the same shall become
     due and payable in accordance with the terms hereof and of the Agreement or
     to affect the relative rights of the Holder and creditors of Buyer (other
     than the Trustee and the Noteholders).

          (e) The Holder shall not, until the Senior Liabilities have been
     finally paid and performed in full and in cash, (i) cancel, waive, forgive,
     transfer or assign, or commence legal proceedings to enforce or collect, or
     subordinate to any obligation of Buyer (other than to the Senior
     Liabilities), howsoever created, arising or evidenced, whether direct or

                                   Exhibit A-3
<Page>

     indirect, absolute or contingent, or now or hereafter existing, or due or
     to become due, the Junior Liabilities or any rights in respect hereof or
     (ii) convert the Junior Liabilities into an equity interest in Buyer,
     unless, in the case of each of CLAUSES (i) and (ii), the Holder shall have
     received the prior written consent of the Trustee in each case; provided,
     however, if the Holder is Vertis, Inc., then the Holder may convert the
     Junior Liabilities into an equity interest in Buyer without the Trustee's
     consent.

          (f) The Holder shall not, without the advance written consent of the
     Trustee, commence, or join with any other Person in commencing, any
     Bankruptcy Proceedings with respect to Buyer until at least one year and
     one day shall have passed after the Senior Liabilities shall have been
     finally paid and performed in full and in cash; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the
     Holder shall at all times have the right to file any claim in or otherwise
     take any action with respect to any insolvency proceeding instituted
     against Buyer by any Person other than the Holder or any other Vertis
     Person (provided that no such action may be taken by the Holder until such
     proceeding has continued undismissed, unstayed and in effect for a period
     of 10 days).

          (g) If, at any time, any payment (in whole or in part) made with
     respect to any Senior Interest is rescinded or must be restored or returned
     by a Noteholder (whether in connection with any Bankruptcy Proceedings or
     otherwise), these Subordination Provisions shall continue to be effective
     or shall be reinstated, as the case may be, as though such payment had not
     been made.

          (h) Each of the Trustee and the Noteholders may, from time to time, in
     its sole discretion, without notice to the Holder, and without waiving any
     of its rights under these Subordination Provisions, take any or all of the
     following actions: (i) retain or obtain an interest in any property to
     secure any of the Senior Liabilities, (ii) retain or obtain the primary or
     secondary obligations of any other obligor or obligors with respect to any
     of the Senior Liabilities, (iii) extend or renew for one or more periods
     (whether or not longer than the original period), alter, increase or
     exchange any of the Senior Liabilities, or release or compromise any
     obligation of any nature with respect to any of the Senior Liabilities,
     (iv) amend, supplement, amend and restate, or otherwise modify any
     Transaction Document to which it is a party, and (v) release its security
     interest in, or surrender, release or permit any substitution or exchange
     for all or any part of any rights or property securing any of the Senior
     Liabilities, or extend or renew for one or more periods (whether or not
     longer than the original period), or release, compromise, alter or exchange
     any obligations of any nature of any obligor with respect to any such
     rights or property.

          (i) The Holder hereby waives: (i) notice of acceptance of these
     Subordination Provisions by the Trustee or any of the Noteholders, (ii)
     notice of the existence, creation, non-payment or non-performance of all or
     any of the Senior Liabilities, and (iii) all diligence in enforcement,
     collection or protection of, or realization upon, the Senior Liabilities,
     or any thereof, or any security therefor.

          (j) These Subordination Provisions constitute a continuing offer from
     Buyer to all Persons who become the holders of, or who continue to hold,
     Senior Liabilities, and these

                                   Exhibit A-4
<Page>

     Subordination Provisions are made for the benefit of the Trustee and the
     Noteholders, and the Trustee may proceed to enforce such provisions on
     behalf of each of such Persons.

     8. GENERAL. No failure or delay on the part of the Holder in exercising any
power or right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single
or partial exercise of any such power or right preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other power or right. No amendment,
modification or waiver of, or consent with respect to, any provision of this
Note shall in any event be effective unless (a) the same shall be in writing and
signed and delivered by Buyer and the Seller, and (b) all consents required for
such actions under the Transaction Documents shall have been received by the
appropriate Persons.

     9. LIMITATION ON INTEREST. Notwithstanding anything in this Note to the
contrary, Buyer shall never be required to pay unearned interest on any amount
outstanding hereunder, and shall never be required to pay interest on the
principal amount outstanding hereunder, at a rate in excess of the maximum
nonusurious interest rate that may be contracted for, charged or received under
applicable federal or state law (such maximum rate being herein called the
"HIGHEST LAWFUL RATE"). If the effective rate of interest that would otherwise
be payable under this Note would exceed the Highest Lawful Rate, or the Holder
shall receive any unearned interest or shall receive monies that are deemed to
constitute interest that would increase the effective rate of interest payable
by Buyer under this Note to a rate in excess of the Highest Lawful Rate, then
(a) the amount of interest that would otherwise be payable by Buyer under this
Note shall be reduced to the amount allowed by applicable law, and (b) any
unearned interest paid by Buyer or any interest paid by Buyer in excess of the
Highest Lawful Rate shall be refunded to Buyer. Without limitation of the
foregoing, all calculations of the rate of interest contracted for, charged or
received by the Holder under this Note that are made for the purpose of
determining whether such rate exceeds the Highest Lawful Rate shall be made, to
the extent permitted by applicable usury laws (now or hereafter enacted), by
amortizing, prorating and spreading in equal parts during the actual period
during which any amount has been outstanding hereunder all interest at any time
contracted for, charged or received by the Holder in connection herewith. If at
any time and from time to time (i) the amount of interest payable to the Holder
on any date shall be computed at the Highest Lawful Rate pursuant to the
provisions of the foregoing sentence, and (ii) in respect of any subsequent
interest computation period the amount of interest otherwise payable to the
Holder would be less than the amount of interest payable to the Holder computed
at the Highest Lawful Rate, then the amount of interest payable to the Holder in
respect of such subsequent interest computation period shall continue to be
computed at the Highest Lawful Rate until the total amount of interest payable
to the Holder shall equal the total amount of interest that would have been
payable to the Holder if the total amount of interest had been computed without
giving effect to the provisions of the foregoing sentence. 10. NO NEGOTIATION.
This Note is not negotiable.

     11. GOVERNING LAW. THIS NOTE SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE A CONTRACT MADE UNDER
AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INTERNAL LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK
INCLUDING SECTION 5-1401(1) OF THE GENERAL OBLIGATIONS LAW, BUT WITHOUT REGARD
TO ANY OTHER CONFLICT OF LAWS PRINCIPLE.

                                   Exhibit A-5

     12. SECURITY INTEREST. The Seller may grant a security interest in or
otherwise pledge this Note as security as collateral for the benefit of Vertis's
senior lenders, and any Person to whom such security interest is granted or to
whom this Note is pledged shall be bound by, and for all purposes takes this
Note subject to, the restrictions and other provisions (including the
Subordination Provisions) set forth herein.

     13. CAPTIONS. Paragraph captions used in this Note are provided solely for
convenience of reference and shall not affect the meaning or interpretation of
any provision of this Note.
