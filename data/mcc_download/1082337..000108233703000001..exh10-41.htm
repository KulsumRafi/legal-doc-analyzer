<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A.&#9;Seller is engaged in the business of making,
originating, and acquiring fixed and variable rate, closed-end and opened-end
single family residential mortgage loans and lines of credit to individual
borrowers (which loans, together with all documents evidencing, securing or in
any way related to the origination and closing of such loans, are hereinafter

Buyer from time to time subject to Buyer's review and acceptance of each such
Loan.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">B.&#9;The Loans shall be evidenced by a promissory note or
line of credit agreement (the "Notes") and secured by deeds of trust, mortgages
or other security instruments (the "Mortgages") covering improved real estate
(the "Mortgaged Property").</P>

<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Mortgaged Property</U>. The Mortgage is a valid and
subsisting first or second, priority lien on the Mortgaged Property, free and

relating to it have been properly signed, are valid and their terms may be
enforced by Buyer, its successors and assigns, subject only to bankruptcy laws,
Soldiers' and Sailors' Relief Acts, laws relating to administering descendants'
estates and general principles of equity. The Note and the Mortgage and every
other agreement, if any, executed and delivered by the Borrower(s) in connection
with the Loan are genuine, and each is the legal, valid and binding obligation
of the maker thereof enforceable in accordance with its terms. All parties to
the Note, the Mortgage and each other such related agreement had legal capacity
to enter into the Loan and to execute and deliver the note, the Mortgage and
each other such related agreement, and the Note, the Mortgage and each other
such related agreement have been duly and properly executed by the respective
Borrower(s). Seller has reviewed all of the documents constituting the Mortgage
File and has made such inquiries as it deems necessary to make and confirm the
accuracy of the representations set forth herein.</LI></P>
<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>No Liens</U>. The Mortgaged Property is free and clear
of all mechanics' liens, materialmen's liens or similar types of liens.&#9;There
are no rights outstanding that could result in any of such liens being imposed
on the Mortgaged Property. </LI></P>
<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>No Modification or Subordination of Mortgage</U>.
Seller has not done any of the following' (a)&nbsp;materially modified the Note
or Mortgage; (b)&nbsp;satisfied or cancelled the Mortgage in whole or in part;
(c)&nbsp;subordinated the Mortgage in whole or in part; (d)&nbsp;released the
Mortgaged Property in whole or in part from the Mortgage lien; or
(e)&nbsp;signed any release, cancellation, modification or satisfaction of the
Mortgage.</LI></P>
<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Loan in Good Standing</U>. There are no defaults under

paid or an escrow of funds sufficient to pay them has been established:
(a)&nbsp;taxes; (b)&nbsp;government assessments; (c)&nbsp;insurance premiums;
(d)&nbsp;water, sewer and municipal charges; (e)&nbsp;leasehold payments; and
(f) ground rents. Seller has no knowledge that any improvement to the Mortgaged
Property is in violation of any applicable zoning law or regulation.</LI></P>

<P ALIGN="RIGHT">                                  * Confidential treatment requested</P>

<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Advances</U>. Seller has not made, or knowingly
received from others, any direct or indirect advance of funds in connection with
the Loan on behalf of the borrower, except as provided in the Underwriting
Guide. This warranty does not cover payment of interest from the earlier of:
(a)&nbsp;the date of the Note; or (b)&nbsp;the date on which the Mortgage
proceeds were disbursed; or (c)&nbsp;the date one month before the first
installment of principal and interest on the Note is due.</LI></P>
<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Property Intact</U>. The Mortgaged Property is not
damaged by fire, wind or other cause of loss. There are no proceedings pending
for the partial or total condemnation of the Mortgaged Property. Any
improvements that are included in the appraised value of the Mortgaged Property
are totally within the property's boundaries and building restriction lines. No
improvements on adjoining property encroach on the Mortgaged Property except as
may be identified by Seller and accepted by Buyer.</LI></P>
<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Note Not Usurious</U>. The Note is not usurious and
either meets or is exempt from any usury laws or regulations.</LI></P>
<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Compliance with Consumer Protection Laws</U>. Seller
has complied with all applicable federal and state laws, regulations and other
requirements including, but not limited to, the Real Estate Settlement
Procedures Act, the Federal Fair Housing Act, the National Flood Insurance Act,
the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, and the Truth In Lending Act.</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to the Fair Housing Act (FHA) and the Equal
Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) Seller has fully complied and will continue to
fully comply, as to each loan, with all federal laws and regulations relating to
FHA and ECOA. Further, Service Provider acknowledges and understands that the
FHA makes it illegal, on the basis of RACE, COLOR, NATIONAL ORIGIN, RELIGION,
SEX, HANDICAP OR FAMILIAL STATUS (having children under the age of 18) to deny a
loan secured by a dwelling or to discriminate in fixing the amount, interest
rate, duration, application procedures or other terms or conditions of such a
loan or in appraising property. Seller also acknowledges and understands that
the ECOA makes it illegal in any credit transaction to discriminate on the basis
of RACE, COLOR, NATIONAL ORIGIN, RELIGION, SEX, MARITAL STATUS OR AGE OR BECAUSE
THE APPLICANT RECEIVES INCOME FROM PUBLIC ASSISTANCE. Seller warrants and
represents that it has not based any pricing quotations or final pricing on the
applicants race, national origin, sex, age or any other illegal basis noted
above but rather that any risk-based pricing classifications were based on
objective credit and risk-related criteria only.</P>
<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Property is Insured</U>. A casualty insurance
replacement policy on the Mortgaged Property is in effect. The policy is written
by an insurance company which meets the requirements set forth in the
Underwriting Guide and provides fire and extended coverages for an amount at
least equal to the amount required by the Underwriting Guide; which amount is
equal to the stated amount of the Loan, unless prohibited by state law.</LI></P>
<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Loan Marketability</U>. Seller knows of nothing
involving the Loan, the Mortgaged Property, the mortgagor or the mortgagor's
credit standing that can reasonably be expected to: (a)&nbsp;cause the Loan to
become delinquent; or (b)&nbsp;adversely affect the Loan's value or
marketability.</LI></P>
<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Adjustable Loans</U>. If the Note provides that the
interest rate or the principal balance of the Note may be adjusted, all of the
terms of the Note may be enforced by Buyer and such adjustments will not affect
the priority of the lien on the Mortgage Property.</LI></P>

<P ALIGN="RIGHT">                                  * Confidential treatment requested</P>

<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Default</U>. No default exists under the Loan. The
Loan is not in the possession of any attorney or collection agency for
collection nor is it the subject of any actual or threatened bankruptcy
proceeding or other litigation. The borrower has not asserted any defense, set-
off, right of rescission or counterclaim, either at law or in equity, in
connection with the Loan.</LI></P>
<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Genuineness of Signatures</U>. All Loan documents are
genuine and contain genuine signatures. The Loan documents that Buyer requires

amounts paid or due under the Note or Mortgage.</LI></P>
<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Appraisals</U>. Seller has obtained valuation of the
property securing the loan using the manner or method stipulated in the
Underwriting Guide. In those instances where an appraisal is required the Seller

signed prior to the approval of the Mortgage application by a qualified
appraiser, who (i)&nbsp;is licensed in the state where the Mortgaged Property is
located (ii)&nbsp;is acceptable to Buyer, (iii)&nbsp;has, no interest, direct or
indirect, in the Mortgaged Property or in any loan on the security thereof, and
(iv)&nbsp;does not receive compensation that is affected by the approval or

responsible for Buyers' attorney fees incurred after Buyer receives notification
of Sellers exercise of such option; unless Buyer and Seller have claims adverse
to each other, in which case the prevailing parties legal fees will be paid by
the losing party. Seller shall have the right to settle any such claim or
litigation, at its sole expense, with the approval of Buyer, which approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld.</P>
