</Table>

     Subject to the following two sentences, a particular Level Status shall
exist on a particular day if on such day the Borrower does not qualify for a
Level Status with more advantageous pricing and either the Moody's Rating or the
S&P Rating is at least equal to the corresponding rating specified for such
Level Status in the table above. In the event of a difference in the equivalent
"rating level" from S&P and Moody's resulting in a split of only one level, then
the Level Status shall be determined by reference to the higher of the two
Ratings. In the event of a difference in the equivalent "rating level" from S&P
and Moody's resulting in a split of greater than one level, then the Level
Status shall be that Level Status one below the Level Status determined by
reference to the higher of the two Ratings. The above ratings are in the format
of S&P Rating/Moody's Rating.

----------
*    The Applicable Utilization Fee Rate shall be payable with respect to
     outstanding Advances on days when Utilization is greater than 33%.
     "Utilization" means, for any day, a percentage equal to the aggregate
     principal amount of Loans hereunder and "Loans" (as defined in the 364-Day
     Agreement) outstanding on such day (and at the close of business on such
     day if a Business Day) divided by the sum on such day of the Aggregate
     Commitment and the "Aggregate Commitment" under the 364-Day Agreement;
     PROVIDED that for purposes of computing Utilization (a) the Aggregate
     Commitment shall be deemed to in no event be less than the aggregate
     outstanding principal amount of the Loans, (b) the "Aggregate Commitment"
     (as defined in the 364-Day Agreement) shall be deemed to in no event be
     less than the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the "Loans" (as
     defined in the 364-Day Agreement) and (c) on and after the "Revolving
     Credit Termination Date" (as defined in the 364-Day Agreement), the
     "Aggregate Commitment" (as defined in the 364-Day Agreement) shall be
     deemed to be equal to the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the
     "Loans" (as defined in the 364-Day Agreement).

<Page>

     For the purposes of this Schedule, the following terms have the following
meanings, subject to the final paragraph of this Schedule:

     "Level Status" means either Level I Status, Level II Status, Level III
Status, Level IV Status, Level V Status or Level VI Status.

     "Moody's Rating" means, at any time, the Borrower Debt Rating issued by
Moody's and then in effect.

     "Rating" means Moody's Rating or S&P Rating.

     "S&P Rating" means, at any time, the Borrower Debt Rating issued by S&P and
then in effect.

     The Applicable Margin, Applicable Facility Fee Rate and Applicable
Utilization Fee Rate shall be determined in accordance with the foregoing table
based on the Borrower's Level Status as determined from its then-current Moody's
and S&P Ratings. The Rating in effect on any date for the purposes of this
Schedule is that in effect at the close of business on such date. If at any time
the Borrower has no Moody's Rating or no S&P Rating or the Borrower does not
qualify for a Level Status with more advantageous pricing, Level VI Status shall
exist.
