<P><FONT SIZE=2>Dear
Dan: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
you know, we have discussed the termination of your employment with Magellan Health Services,&nbsp;Inc. ("Magellan"), effective November&nbsp;30, 2002. Set forth below are the
details of your separation and information regarding your benefits. </FONT></P>

<DL compact>
<DT style='margin-bottom:-11pt;'><FONT SIZE=2>1.</FONT></DT><DD><FONT SIZE=2>Your
employment with Magellan will terminate on November&nbsp;30, 2002 ("Termination Date"). Provided that your employment is not terminated for cause prior to the Termination Date,
Magellan will pay you a lump sum payment equal to thirteen months of your current annual salary. This payment will be made on December&nbsp;1, 2002. In addition, you will be paid your accrued and
unused PTO pay. If you die before Magellan has made all of these payments, Magellan shall make these payments to your estate.
<BR><BR></FONT></DD><DT style='margin-bottom:-11pt;'><FONT SIZE=2>2.</FONT></DT><DD><FONT SIZE=2>In
addition to the payments set forth above, Magellan will reimburse you for the cost of leasing your current apartment in Columbia, Maryland for the months of November and
December&nbsp;2002. Magellan will also reimburse your moving expenses from Columbia, Maryland to Connecticut, up to a maximum of $5,000.
<BR><BR></FONT></DD><DT style='margin-bottom:-11pt;'><FONT SIZE=2>3.</FONT></DT><DD><FONT SIZE=2>The
