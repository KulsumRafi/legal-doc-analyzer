<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.5in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">WHEREAS,
Indemnitee is a director, officer, employee or other agent of the Corporation,
or is serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer,
employee or other agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture,
trust or other enterprise (an &#147;Alternate Enterprise&#148;) and in such capacity is

Indemnitee is willing to serve, continue to serve, and take on additional
service for or on behalf of the Corporation on the condition that he or she be
indemnified as herein provided; and</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.5in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">WHEREAS, it is
intended that Indemnitee shall be paid promptly by the Corporation all amounts
necessary to effectuate in full the indemnity provided herein.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.5in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">NOW THEREFORE,
in consideration of the premises and the covenants in this Agreement, and

officer, employee or other agent of the Corporation, or at the request of the
Corporation as a director, officer, employee or other agent of an Alternate
Enterprise, so long as he or she is duly appointed or elected and qualified in
accordance with the applicable provisions of the Restated Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws of the Corporation or the applicable charter documents
of any Alternate Enterprise, and until such time as he or she resigns or fails
to stand for election or is removed from his or her position.&#160; Indemnitee may at any time and for any
reason resign or be removed from such position (subject to any other
contractual obligation or other obligation imposed by operation of law), in
which event the Corporation shall have no obligation under this Agreement to
continue Indemnitee in any such position.</font></p>

Indemnitee against Expenses and Liabilities in connection with any Proceeding
arising out of acts or omissions of Indemnitee occurring during Indemnitee&#146;s
service as a director, officer, employee or other agent of the Corporation, or
during Indemnitee&#146;s service at the request of the Corporation as a director,

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">Incorporation or Bylaws may
from time to time be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to
the extent such amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader
indemnification rights than the DGCL or such Restated Certificate of
Incorporation or Bylaws permitted the Corporation to provide before such amendment).&#160; The right to indemnification provided in the
Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Corporation shall be
presumed to have been relied upon by Indemnitee in serving or continuing to
serve the Corporation and shall be enforceable as a contract right.&#160; Without diminishing the scope of the
indemnification provided by this Section&nbsp;2, the Corporation shall
indemnify Indemnitee whenever he or she is or was a party or is threatened to
be made a party to any Proceeding, including without limitation any such
Proceeding brought by or in the right of the Corporation, because he or she is
or was a director, officer, employee or other agent of the Corporation, or is
serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or
other agent of an Alternate Enterprise, or because of anything done or not done
by Indemnitee in any such capacity, against Expenses and Liabilities actually
and reasonably incurred by Indemnitee or on his or her behalf in connection
with such Proceeding, including the costs of any investigation, defense,
settlement or appeal, except that no indemnification shall be made with respect
to any claim, issue or matter if Indemnitee was finally adjudged to be liable
to the Corporation by a court of competent jurisdiction due to his or her gross
negligence or willful misconduct unless and to the extent that a Delaware Court
of Chancery or the court in which the action was heard determines that
Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification for such amounts as the court deems
proper.&#160; For example, if Indemnitee is
adjudged liable due to gross negligence or willful misconduct with respect to
some but not all claims advanced against him or her, Indemnitee shall be
indemnified against those claims as to which he or she was adjudged not to have
been grossly negligent or to have engaged in willful misconduct.&#160; In addition to, and not as a limitation of,
the foregoing, the rights of indemnification of Indemnitee provided under this
Agreement shall include those rights set forth in Sections&nbsp;3, 7, 8 and 12
below.</font></p>

this Agreement to indemnification by the Corporation for a portion of the
Expenses and Liabilities that Indemnitee becomes legally obligated to pay in
connection with any Proceeding referred to in paragraph (a) above even if not
entitled hereunder to indemnification for the total amount thereof, and the
Corporation shall indemnify Indemnitee for the portion thereof to which
Indemnitee is entitled.</font></p>

behalf of Indemnitee shall be advanced from time to time by the Corporation to
Indemnitee within thirty (30) days after the Corporation&#146;s receipt of a written
request for an advance of Expenses, whether prior to or after final disposition
of a Proceeding (except to the extent that there has been a Final Adverse
Determination that Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified for such
Expenses), including without limitation any Proceeding brought by or in the
right of the Corporation.&#160; The written
request for an advancement of any and all Expenses under this paragraph shall
contain reasonable detail of the Expenses incurred by Indemnitee.&#160; If required by the DGCL at the time of such
advance, Indemnitee hereby agrees to repay the amounts advanced if it is
ultimately determined that Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.</font></p>
