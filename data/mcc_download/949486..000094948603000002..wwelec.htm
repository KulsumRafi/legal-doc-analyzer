<FONT SIZE=3><P>Excess Energy may be delivered only while the Project  is on line in accordance with a Dispatch Order pursuant to the PPA.  In the event that the Project  is on line and is derated , for any reason, such that Seller's obligations to Buyer pursuant to the PPA cannot be met, sale of energy under this Amended Agreement will be either partially or entirely curtailed for Seller to first meet its obligations under the PPA.  Should Excess Energy delivery be curtailed, Seller will compensate Buyer for the reasonably incurred cost of replacing Excess Energy which was not delivered less the cost Buyer would have paid Seller for the Excess Energy (a) when the Project  is unavailable due to an unscheduled outage, or (b) for any portion of the excess energy which cannot be produced by the Project  when the Project  is operating.  The differential cost for replacement energy, in any given month, may be applied by Buyer as a credit toward the Demand Charge for that month, provided the credit may not exceed the Demand Charge for that month nor be applied to any other month.  Derates for the purpose of this Amended Agreement means any period which the Facility is restricted from providing the demonstrated Excess Capacity under this Amended Agreement.<BR>
