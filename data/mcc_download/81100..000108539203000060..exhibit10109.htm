<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Employee shall accrue a supplemental
retirement benefit under the Company&#146;s Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan dated
as of June 1, 1997 (the &#147;SERP&#148;), as modified by the terms of this Agreement. The
benefit shall accrue at the rate of three Years of Service under the SERP for each year of
employment with the Company commencing December 1, 2001, so that Employee shall have
accrued 15 Years of Service for purposes of the SERP on November 30, 2006. If Employee
completes five year of employment after December 1, 2001, she shall be entitled to a
monthly benefit upon retirement at age 62 equal to one-twelfth of 50% of (a) the annual
average of her highest 36 consecutive months of salary paid or payable, plus (b) the
average of her highest three annual bonuses paid or payable (collectively,
&#147;Earnings&#148;). As provided in the SERP, this monthly amount shall be reduced by
the monthly amount payable as of the retirement date for the life of Employee under the
Company&#146;s qualified retirement pension plan (or, if payable as of another date and/or
payable in another form, the Actuarial Equivalent (as defined in the SERP) of the monthly
amount payable under the qualified retirement pension plan as of the retirement date for
the life of Employee). Employee may elect to take early retirement after attaining age 55,
whether or not she is then employed by the Company, in which case the monthly benefit will
be reduced, as provided in the SERP, one-third of one percent for each month that benefits
commence prior to the month in which Employee would attain age 62. If Employee&#146;s
employment with the Company terminates for any reason prior to the completion of five
years of service to the Company, the supplemental retirement benefits shall vest at the
rate of 20% for each full 12 month period of employment commencing with December 1, 2001.
For example, if Employee&#146;s employment terminates on November 30, 2004, the benefit
payable at age 62 would be 30% of Earnings (60% times 50% equals 30%). If employment
terminates on November 30, 2002, the benefit payable at age 62 would be 10% of Earnings
(20% times 50% equals 10%). If Employee&#146;s employment terminates prior to the
completion of three years of service, her Earnings will be determined based upon the
period of time actually served. Employee&#146;s supplemental retirement benefits will
become 100% vested, and Employee shall be credited with 15 Years of Service under the
SERP, upon the occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined in the separate change of
control agreement entered into between Employee and the Company), without regard to
Employee&#146;s number of years of employment. Vested benefits shall not be forfeitable
for any reason, including the subsequent termination of Employee&#146;s employment by the
Company with or without cause. Except as specifically set forth herein, Employee&#146;s
supplemental retirement benefit shall be subject to the terms and conditions of the SERP.
In the event of conflict between the terms of the SERP and the terms of this Agreement,
this Agreement shall be controlling, unless applying the terms of the SERP would result in
a greater benefit to Employee. Employee may elect any alternate form of payment of
supplemental retirement benefits permitted by the SERP. No amendment or termination of the
SERP shall alter the terms of this Agreement in a manner that would diminish the benefits
payable hereunder. The provisions of this Section 8 shall survive the expiration of the
Term and any termination of this Agreement. </FONT></P>

substantially perform her duties with the Company (other than any such failure resulting
from incapacity due to physical or mental illness), for a period of 30 days after written
notice of demand for substantial performance has been delivered to Employee by the Board
of Directors which specifically identifies the manner in which the Board believes that
Employee has not substantially performed her duties, or (b) the willful engaging by
Employee in gross misconduct materially and demonstrably injurious to the Company, as
determined by the Board of Directors after notice to Employee and an opportunity for a
hearing. No act, nor failure to act, on Employee&#146;s part shall be considered
&#147;willful&#148; unless she has acted or failed to act with an absence of good faith
and without a reasonable belief that her action or failure to act was in the best
interests of the Company. If the Board of Directors of the Company terminates

Employee under this Agreement her current base salary through the date of termination, and

offer to extend the Term as provided in Section 2 above for at least an additional two

earned through the date of termination, (b) a pro rata portion (based on the portion of

in which the termination occurs, (c) a pro rata portion (based on the portion of the award
cycle elapsed prior to the date of termination and the total shareholder return
performance of the Company relative to the comparator companies during that period) of all
outstanding LTIP awards, including accrued dividends, (whether or not then fully vested),

without cause before Employee&#146;s supplemental retirement benefits have become fully
vested under the terms of this Agreement, Employee shall be credited with two additional
years of employment (i.e., six Years of Service) for purposes of determining the
supplemental retirement benefit payable pursuant to Section 8 of this Agreement. </FONT></P>
