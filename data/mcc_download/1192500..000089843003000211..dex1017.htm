national sales representative, local sales representative, agency or employee engaged by it for the purpose of selling advertising that is carried during the programming it provides to Owner. Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the
contrary, to the extent that Owner has received prepayment for advertising time for periods following the Effective Date, Owner shall disclose such prepayments to Broker on or prior to the Effective Date and such prepayments shall be deducted from
the amounts due to Owner pursuant to Section 2 of this Agreement. All information provided by Owner prior to the Effective Date, pursuant to the terms of the FM Asset Purchase Agreement, shall accurately reflect all advertisements scheduled
following the Effective Date. If advertisers whose advertisements air on the Station on or after the Effective Date make payments to Owner rather than to Broker with respect to such advertisements, Owner shall hold such amounts in trust for Broker,
shall promptly notify Broker of the receipt of such funds and shall forward such amounts to Broker within five (5) business days. If advertisers whose advertisements aired on the Station prior to the Effective Date make payments to Broker rather

If Owner fails to forward such amount to Broker within five (5) business days, Broker shall have the right to set such amounts off against the payments due under Section 2 hereunder with amounts subsequently paid by Owner being reimbursed by Broker.
