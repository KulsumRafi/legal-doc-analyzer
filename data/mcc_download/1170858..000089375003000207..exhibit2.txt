4.    Operating Indicators

Water and sewage volumes billed to the retail during 2002 presented a 4.0% and
a 4.9% growth, respectively, in relation to 2001. This growth was a result of
the gradual return normal customer consumption habits, after the electric
energy rationing program in 2001/2002. Additionally, the higher growth in the
sewage segment shows the company's commitment to increase the reach of its
sewage services, extending it to the whole population. Water and sewage
volumes are presented below:

5. Financing

5.1 Financing in 2002

During the fiscal year of 2002 Sabesp completed the 5th issue of
Non-Convertible Debentures totaling R$ 400 million, in order to rollover the
debt maturing within the year. The instruments issued are not guaranteed by
neither the State of Sao Paulo, nor Sabesp, proving the Company's credit
quality in the financial markets.

To make the Multi-Year Investment Plan possible, Sabesp negotiated with many
financial agents during the year 2002, among which we can highlight the
following:


a) BNDES - Brazilian National Development Bank

Sabesp signed on August 8th, 2002 a loan contract with BNDES and its private
accredited financial agencies amounting to R$ 240 million to finance part of
the domestic portion of the funding of Tiete Project - 2nd stage, a project of
R$ 400 million, whose foreign portion is being financed by BID - International
Development Bank (financing contract signed on July/2000). The first
disbursement occurred in November 2002.


b) JBIC - Japan Bank for International Cooperation

JBIC's loan will be used in the Environment Recovery Program for the Santos
metro region, a project of R$ 833 million ((Y) 28.407 million), whose
resources provided by JBIC total R$ 635 million ((Y) 21.637 million), while
Sabesp's portion totals R$ 199 million ((Y) 6.770 million).

The negotiation of the financing contract minute and the procedures for the
approval of the guarantees are being conducted, and the negotiation for the
exchange of Diplomatic Notes are in the final stage. The contracts are
expected to be signed in the beginning of the second half of 2003.

c) FGTS - Government Severance Indemnity Fund for Employees

     1 - Pro-Sanitation Program - Contracted Funds

         In 2002, total capex made by Sabesp in projects under the
         Pro-Sanitation Program, in sewage services, water supply,
         institutional development and integrated sanitation (Prosanear), is
         composed by R$ 24.1 million, being R$ 13.4 million from financed
         resources and R$ 10.7 million from own resources.

     2 - Pro-Sanitation Program - New Funds

         Sabesp is negotiating water and sewerage work financing contracts
         using resources from FGTS, whose manager is Caixa Economica Federal
         (the Federal Savings and Loan Bank), totaling R$ 324 million, with
         disbursements expected for 2003. Sixteen projects were filed,
         organized and selected by SEDU (Special Urban Development Bureau),
         which is currently under the Ministry of Cities.


d) FEHIDRO - Water Resources State Fund

In 2002, 17 projects were hired, totaling a capex of R$ 7 million, of which R$
2.6 million corresponds to funds with no financial cost and no reimbursement
obligation, and own resources totaling R$ 4.4 million.


5.2. Future Revenues from Sewage Treatment

PRODES - ANA's (National Water Agency) National Program to Unpollute
Hydrographic Basins

Based on Resolution # 6 of March 6, 2001, on Law # 9984 of July 17, 2000 and
on Law # 9433 of January 8, 1997, the Union, acting through the National Water
Agency, and with the assistance of the Hydrographic Basin Committees, will
sign, in the beginning of 2003, nine contracts to offer financial incentive by
paying for the sewage treated, under PRODES - National Program to Unpollute
Hydrographic Basins. These nine sewage treatment initiatives amount to R$159.1
million, of which approximately R$22 million will be paid back to Sabesp,
starting in 2006, as compensation for the sewage treated.
