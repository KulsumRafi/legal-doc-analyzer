The Agent, on or before 1:00 Chicago time on the same Business Day such notice is given, shall provide notice of such requested Advance to each Lender  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the proceeds of each such requested Loan shall be made available to the Company by depositing the proceeds thereof, in immediately available funds, on the Advance Date for such Loan in an account maintained and designated by the Company at the principal office of the Agent.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the LC Issuer shall, on the date any Letter of Credit Advance is requested to be made, issue the related Letter of Credit for the account of the Company.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the LC Issuer may decline to issue any requested Letter of Credit on the basis that the beneficiary, the purpose of issuance or the terms or the conditions of drawing are unacceptable to the LC Issuer in its discretion. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;(b)&#9;Each Lender, on the date any Advance in the form of a Loan is requested to be made, shall make its Pro Rata Share of such Advance available in immediately available, freely transferable, cleared funds for disbursement to the Company pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement at the principal office of the Agent.  Unless the Agent shall have received notice from any Lender prior to the date such Advance is requested to be made under this Section 3.1 that such Lender will not make available to the Agent such Lender's Pro Rata Share  of such Advance, the Agent may assume that such Lender has made such portion available to the Agent on the date such Advance is requested to be made in accordance with this Section 3.1.  If and to the extent such Lender shall not have so made such Pro Rata Share available to the Agent, the Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) make such amount available to the Company, and such Lender and the Company severally agree to pay to the Agent forthwith on demand such amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is made available to the Company by the Agent until the date such amount is repaid to the Agent, at the Federal Funds Effective Rate.  If such Lender shall pay such amount to the Agent together with interest, such amount so paid shall constitute a Loan by such Lender as a part of such the related Advance for purposes of this Agreement.  The failure of any Lender to make its Pro Rata Share of any such Advance available to the Agent shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligations to make available its pro rata portion of such Advance on the date such Advance is requested to be made, but no Lender shall be responsible for failure of any other Lender to make such Pro Rata Share available to the Agent on the date of any such Advance.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;(d)&#9;Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to require or authorize any Lender to issue any Letter of Credit, it being recognized that the LC Issuer has the sole obligation under this Agreement to issue Letters of Credit on behalf of the Lenders, and the Commitment of each Lender with respect to Letter of Credit  Advances is expressly conditioned upon the LC Issuer's performance of such obligations.  Upon such issuance by the LC Issuer, each Lender shall automatically acquire a pro rata risk participation interest in such Letter of Credit Advance based on the amount of its Pro Rata Share.  If the LC Issuer shall honor a draft or other demand for payment presented or made under any Letter of Credit, the LC Issuer shall provide notice thereof to each Lender on the date such draft or demand is honored unless the Company shall have satisfied its Reimbursement Obligation under Section 4.3 by payment to the LC Issuer on such date.  Each Lender, on such date, shall make its Pro Rata Share of the amount paid by the  LC Issuer available in immediately available funds at the principal office of the Agent for the account of the LC Issuer.  If and to the extent such Lender shall not have made such Pro Rata Share available to the Agent, such Lender and the Company severally agree to pay to the LC Issuer forthwith on demand such amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount was paid by the LC Issuer until such amount is so made available to the Agent at a per annum rate equal to  the Federal Funds Effective Rate.  If such Lender shall pay such amount to the Agent together with such interest, such amount so paid shall constitute a Loan by such Lender as part of the Advance disbursed in respect of the Reimbursement Obligation of the Company under Section 4.3 for purposes of this Agreement.  The failure of any Lender to make its Pro Rata Share of any such amount paid by the LC Issuer available to the Agent shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligation to make available its Pro Rata Share of such amount, but no Lender shall be responsible for failure of any other Lender to make such Pro Rata Share available to the Agent.</P>

The terms and provisions of the Loan Documents shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Company and the Lenders and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, except that (i) the Company shall not have the right to assign its rights or obligations under the Loan Documents without the prior written consent of each Lender, (ii) any assignment by any Lender must be made in compliance with Section 11.3, and (iii) any transfer by Participation must be made in compliance with Section 11.2.  Any attempted assignment or transfer by any party not made in compliance with this Section 11.1 shall be null and void, unless such attempted assignment or transfer is treated as a participation in accordance with Section 11.3(b).  The parties to this Agreement acknowledge that clause (ii) of this Section 11.1 relates only to absolute assignments and this Section 11.1 does not prohibit assignments creating security interests, including, without limitation, (x) any pledge or assignment by any Lender of all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement and any Note to a Federal Reserve Bank or (y) in the case of a Lender which is a Fund, any pledge or assignment of all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement and any Note to its trustee in support of its obligations to its trustee; <I>provided, however, </I>that no such pledge or assignment creating a security interest shall release the transferor Lender from its obligations hereunder unless and until the parties thereto have complied with the provisions of Section 11.3.

Any request, authority or consent of any Person, who at the time of making such request or giving such authority or consent is the owner of the rights to any Loan (whether or not a Note has been issued in evidence thereof), shall be conclusive and binding on any subsequent holder or assignee of the rights to such Loan.</P>

Any Lender may at any time sell to one or more banks or other entities ("Participants") participating interests in any Outstanding Credit Exposure owing to such Lender, any Note held by such Lender, any Commitment of such Lender or any other interest of such Lender under the Loan Documents.  In the event of any such sale by a Lender of participating interests to a Participant, such Lender's obligations under the Loan Documents shall remain unchanged, such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations, such Lender shall remain the owner of its Outstanding Credit Exposure and the holder of any Note issued to it in evidence thereof for all purposes under the Loan Documents, all amounts payable by the Company under this Agreement shall be determined as if such Lender had not sold such participating interests, and the Company and the Agent shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under the Loan Documents.</P>

The Company agrees that each Participant shall be deemed to have the right of setoff provided in Section 8.2(c) in respect of its participating interest in amounts owing under the Loan Documents to the same extent as if the amount of its participating interest were owing directly to it as a Lender under the Loan Documents, <I>provided</I> that each Lender shall retain the right of setoff provided in Section 8.2(c)<B> </B>with respect to the amount of participating interests sold to each Participant.  The Lenders agree to share with each Participant, and each Participant, by exercising the right of setoff provided in Section 8.2(c), agrees to share with each Lender, any amount received pursuant to the exercise of its right of setoff, such amounts to be shared in accordance with Section 8.2(c) as if each Participant were a Lender.  The Company further agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 4.6, 4.8 and 4.10 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to Section 11.3, <I>provided</I> that (i) a Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 4.6, 4.8 or 4.10 than the Lender who sold the participating interest to such Participant would have received had it retained such interest for its own account, unless the sale of such interest to such Participant is made with the prior written consent of the Company, and (ii) any Participant not incorporated under the laws of the United States of America or any State thereof agrees to comply with the provisions of Section 4.6 to the same extent as if it were a Lender.</P>

Any Lender may at any time assign to one or more banks or other entities ("Purchasers") all or any part of its rights and obligations under the Loan Documents.  Such assignment shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit C or in such other form as may be agreed to by the parties thereto.  Each such assignment with respect to a Purchaser which is not a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund shall either be in an amount equal to the entire applicable Commitment and Loans of the assigning Lender or  (unless each of the Company and the Agent otherwise consents) be in an aggregate amount not less than $5,000,000.  The amount of the assignment shall be based on the Commitment or outstanding Loans (if the Commitment has been terminated) subject to the assignment, determined as of the date of such assignment or as of the "Trade Date," if the "Trade Date" is specified in the assignment.</P>
<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
</U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;(b)  <U>Consents</U>.  The consent of the Company shall be required prior to an assignment becoming effective unless the Purchaser is a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund, provided that the consent of the Company shall not be required if a Default has occurred and is continuing.  The consent of the Agent shall be required prior to an assignment becoming effective unless the Purchaser is a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund.  Any consent required under this Section 11.3(b) shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.</P>
<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
</U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;(c)  <U>Effect; Effective Date</U>.  Upon (i) delivery to the Agent of an assignment, together with any consents required by Sections 11.3(a) and 11.3(b), and (ii) payment of a $3,500 fee to the Agent for processing such assignment (unless such fee is waived by the Agent), such assignment shall become effective on the effective date specified in such assignment.  The assignment shall contain a representation by the Purchaser to the effect that none of the consideration used to make the purchase of the Commitment and Outstanding Credit Exposure under the applicable assignment agreement constitutes "plan assets" as defined under ERISA and that the rights and interests of the Purchaser in and under the Loan Documents will not be "plan assets" under ERISA.  On and after the effective date of such assignment, such Purchaser shall for all purposes be a Lender party to this Agreement and any other Loan Document executed by or on behalf of the Lenders and shall have all the rights and obligations of a Lender under the Loan Documents, to the same extent as if it were an original party thereto, and the transferor Lender shall be released with respect to the Commitment and Outstanding Credit Exposure assigned to such Purchaser without any further consent or action by the Company, the Lenders or the Agent.  In the case of an assignment covering all of the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a Lender hereunder but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of, and subject to, those provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents which survive payment of the Obligations and termination of the applicable agreement.  Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this Section 11.3 shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with Section 11.2.  Upon the consummation of any assignment to a Purchaser pursuant to this Section 11.3(c), the transferor Lender, the Agent and the Company shall, if the transferor Lender or the Purchaser desires that its Loans be evidenced by Notes, make appropriate arrangements so that new Notes or, as appropriate, replacement Notes are issued to such transferor Lender and new Notes or, as appropriate, replacement Notes, are issued to such Purchaser, in each case in principal amounts reflecting their respective Commitments, as adjusted pursuant to such assignment.</P>
<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
</U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;(d)  <U>Register</U>.  The Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of the Company, shall maintain at one of its offices in Chicago, Illinois a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal amounts of the Loans owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the "Register").  The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, and the Company, the Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary.  The Register shall be available for inspection by the Company and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.  </P>
