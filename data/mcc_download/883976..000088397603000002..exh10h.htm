GENERAL</U>.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the RARE  Hospitality  International,  Inc.  2002 Stock Option Plan (the
"Plan") is to promote the success, and enhance the value, of RARE Hospitality International,  Inc. (the "Company"),
by linking the personal  interests of employees,  officers,  directors,  consultants and advisors of the Company or
any Affiliate (as defined below) to those of Company  stockholders  and by providing such persons with an incentive
for  outstanding  performance.  The Plan is further  intended to provide  flexibility to the Company in its ability
to motivate,  attract,  and retain the services of employees,  officers,  directors,  consultants and advisors upon
whose  judgment,  interest,  and  special  effort the  successful  conduct of the  Company's  operation  is largely
dependent.  Accordingly,  the Plan  permits the grant of stock  options  from time to time to  selected  employees,
officers, directors, consultants and advisors of the Company or any Affiliate.</FONT></p>

COMMITTEE</U>.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Plan shall be  administered  by a committee  (the  "Committee")  appointed by the
Board (which  Committee  shall consist of two or more  directors)  or, at the  discretion of the Board from time to
time, the Plan may be  administered  by the Board.  It is intended that at least two of the directors  appointed to
serve on the  Committee  shall be  "non-employee  directors"  (within the meaning of Rule 16b-3 under the 1934 Act)
and "outside  directors"  (within the meaning of Code Section 162(m) and the  regulations  thereunder) and that any
such members of the Committee who do not so qualify  shall  abstain from  participating  in any decision to make or
administer  Options that are made to Eligible  Participants who at the time of  consideration  for such Option are,
or who are  anticipated  to be become,  either (i) Covered  Employees  or (ii) persons  subject to the  short-swing
profit rules of Section 16 of the 1934 Act.  However,  the mere fact that a Committee  member shall fail to qualify
under either of the  foregoing  requirements  or shall fail to abstain from such action  shall not  invalidate  any
Option made by the Committee  which Option is otherwise  validly made under the Plan.  The members of the Committee
shall be appointed by, and may be changed at any time and from time to time in the  discretion  of, the Board.  The
Board may reserve to itself any or all of the authority and  responsibility  of the Committee under the Plan or may
act as  administrator  of the Plan for any and all  purposes.  To the extent the Board has reserved  any  authority
and  responsibility  or during any time that the Board is acting as  administrator  of the Plan,  it shall have all
the powers of the Committee  hereunder,  and any reference herein to the Committee (other than in this Section 4.1)
shall  include the Board.  To the extent any action of the Board under the Plan  conflicts  with  actions  taken by
the Committee, the actions of the Board shall control.</FONT></p>

         determined by the  Committee,  provided that the exercise  price for any Option shall not be less than the

                  (b)      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>TIME AND  CONDITIONS  OF EXERCISE</U>.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The Committee  shall  determine the time or times at

         also determine the performance or other  conditions,  if any, that must be satisfied before all or part of
         an Option may be exercised or vested.  Subject to Section  8.7,  the  Committee  may waive any exercise or
         vesting provisions at any time in whole or in part based upon factors as
         the Committee may determine in its sole  discretion so that the Option  becomes  exercisable  or vested at
         an earlier  date.  The Committee may permit an  arrangement  whereby  receipt of Stock upon exercise of an
         Option is delayed until a specified future date.<br><br>

                  (c)      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>PAYMENT</U>.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The Committee  shall  determine the methods by which the exercise  price of an

         (including  "cashless  exercise"  arrangements),  and the methods by which  Shares  shall be  delivered or
         deemed to be delivered to  Participants;  provided,  however,  that if Shares are used to pay the exercise
         price of an Option,  such  Shares must have been held by the  Participant  as fully  vested  shares for at
         least six months.<br><br>

                  (d)      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>EXERCISE  TERM</U>.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In no event may any Option be  exercisable  for more than ten years from
         the Grant Date.<br><br>

                  (e)      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>ADDITIONAL  OPTIONS UPON EXERCISE</U>.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The Committee may, in its sole  discretion,  provide
         in an Option  Certificate,  or in an amendment  thereto,  for the  automatic  grant of a new Option to any
         Participant  who  delivers  Shares  as full or  partial  payment  of the  exercise  price of the  original
         Option.  Any new  Option  granted  in such a case (i)  shall  be for the  same  number  of  Shares  as the
         Participant  delivered in exercising  the original  Option,  (ii) shall have an exercise  price of 100% of
         the Fair  Market  Value of the  surrendered  Shares on the date of exercise  of the  original  Option (the
         Grant Date for the new  Option),  (iii) shall vest six (6) months  after the Grant Date of the new Option,

         Participant in any calendar year may not exceed $100,000.00.<br><br>

                  (c) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     TEN PERCENT  OWNERS.  No Incentive  Stock Option shall be granted to any individual who,

limitation,  cash,  Stock,  other  Options,  or other  property,  or any  combination,  and may be made in a single
payment or transfer,  in  installments,  or on a deferred  basis,  in each case determined in accordance with rules
adopted by, and at the discretion of, the Committee.</FONT></p>

LIMITS ON  TRANSFER</U>.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No right or  interest of a  Participant  in any  unexercised  Option may be
pledged,  encumbered,  or hypothecated to or in favor of any party other than the Company or an Affiliate, or shall
be subject to any lien,  obligation,  or liability of such Participant to any other party other than the Company or
an  Affiliate.  No  unexercised  Option  shall be  assignable  or  transferable  by a  Participant  other than to a
beneficiary  designated  as provided in 8.3 or by will or the laws of descent and  distribution  or,  except in the
case of an Incentive Stock Option,  pursuant to a domestic relations order that would satisfy Section  414(p)(1)(A)
of the Code if such Section  applied to an Option under the Plan;  provided,  however,  that the Committee may (but
need not) permit other transfers  where the Committee  concludes that such  transferability  (i) does not result in
accelerated  taxation,  (ii) does not cause any  Option  intended  to be an  Incentive  Stock  Option to fail to be
described in Code  Section  422(b),  and (iii) is  otherwise  appropriate  and  desirable,  taking into account any
factors deemed  relevant,  including  without  limitation,  state or Federal tax or securities  laws  applicable to
transferable options.</FONT></p>

BENEFICIARIES</U>.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding  Section 8.2, a Participant may, in the manner  determined by the
Committee,  designate a beneficiary to exercise the rights of the Participant and to receive any distribution  with
respect to any Option upon the Participant's death.  A beneficiary, legal guardian, legal representative,
or other person claiming any rights under the Plan is subject to all terms and
conditions of the Plan and any Option Certificate applicable to the Participant,
except to the extent the Plan and Option Certificate otherwise provide, and to
any additional restrictions deemed necessary or appropriate by the Committee. If
no beneficiary has been designated or survives the Participant, payment shall be
made to the Participant&#146;s estate. Subject to the foregoing, a beneficiary
designation may be changed or revoked by a Participant at any time provided the
change or revocation is filed with the Committee. </FONT></p>

restrictions as the Committee deems necessary or advisable to comply with Federal or state  securities  laws, rules
and  regulations  and the rules of any  national  securities  exchange or automated  quotation  system on which the
Stock  is  listed,  quoted,  or  traded.  The  Committee  may  place  legends  on any  stock  certificate  or issue
instructions to the transfer agent to reference restrictions applicable to the Stock.</FONT></p>

Participant&#146;s Option Certificate to the contrary, upon a Participant&#146;s
death or Disability during his Continuous Status as a Participant, all of his
outstanding Options shall become fully vested and exercisable and shall
thereafter continue or lapse in accordance with the other provisions of the Plan
and the Option Certificate.</FONT></p>

ACCELERATION UPON A CHANGE IN CONTROL</U>.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except as otherwise  provided in the Option  Certificate,
all of a  Participant's  outstanding  Options  shall  become  fully  vested and  exercisable  if the  Participant's
employment  is  terminated  without  Cause or the  Participant  resigns for Good Reason  within two years after the
effective  date of a Change of Control.  Such Options shall  thereafter  continue or lapse in  accordance  with the
other provisions of the Plan and the applicable Option Certificates.</FONT></p>

ACCELERATION  FOR OTHER  REASONS</U>.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regardless  of whether an event has  occurred as  described in
Section  8.5 or 8.6  above,  the  Committee  may in its  sole  discretion  at any  time  determine  that,  upon the
termination  of  employment  or service of a  Participant,  all or a portion of such  Participant's  Options  shall
become fully or partially  exercisable as of such date as the Committee may, in its sole discretion,  declare.  The
Committee may  discriminate  among  Participants  and among  Options  granted to a  Participant  in exercising  its
discretion pursuant to this Section 8.7.</FONT></p>

EFFECT  OF  ACCELERATION</U>.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If an  Option  is  accelerated  under  Section  8.5,  8.6 or 8.7,  the
Committee may, in its sole  discretion,  provide (i) that the Option will expire after a designated  period of time
after such  acceleration  to the extent not then  exercised,  (ii) that the Option  will be settled in cash  rather
than  Stock,  (iii)  that the  Option  will be  assumed  by  another  party  to a  transaction  giving  rise to the
acceleration  or otherwise be equitably  converted or substituted in connection  with such  transaction,  (iv) that
the Option may be settled by payment in cash or cash  equivalents  equal to the excess of the Fair Market  Value of
the  underlying  Stock,  as of a specified date  associated  with the  transaction,  over the exercise price of the
Option,  or (v) any  combination of the foregoing.  The  Committee's  determination  need not be uniform and may be
different for different  Participants  whether or not such Participants are similarly situated.  To the extent that
such acceleration  causes Incentive Stock Options to exceed the dollar limitation set forth in Section 7.2(b),  the
excess Options shall be deemed to be Non-Qualified Stock Options.</FONT></p>

DETERMINATION  OF  EMPLOYMENT  STATUS</U>.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether  military,  government  or other service or other
leave of absence  shall  constitute a termination  of employment  shall be determined in each case by the Committee
at its  discretion,  and any  determination  by the  Committee  shall  be final  and  conclusive.  A  Participant's
Continuous  Status as a Participant  shall not be deemed to terminate (i) in a circumstance  in which a Participant
transfers  from the Company to an  Affiliate,  transfers  from an Affiliate to the Company,  or transfers  from one
Affiliate  to another  Affiliate,  or (ii) in the  discretion  of the  Committee  as  specified at or prior to such
occurrence,  in the case of a spin-off,  sale or disposition of the Participant's  employer from the Company or any
Affiliate.  To the extent that this  provision  causes  Incentive  Stock Options to extend beyond three months from
the date a  Participant  is deemed to be an  employee  of the  Company,  a Parent or  Subsidiary  for  purposes  of
Sections 424(e) and 424(f) of the Code, the Options held by such  Participant  shall be deemed to be  Non-Qualified
Stock Options.</FONT></p>

<p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>8.10.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>
LOANS OR  GUARANTEES</U>.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the consent of the  Committee,  the Company or an  Affiliate  may make,
guarantee or arrange for a loan or loans to a Participant  with respect to or allow a Participant  to defer payment
to the Company of all or any  portion of (i) the  exercise  price of any Option  granted  under the Plan,  (ii) the
purchase price, if any, of any Option granted  hereunder  and/or (iii) the payment by the Participant of any or all
Federal  and/or  state  income or  employment  taxes due on account of the  exercise of any Option  hereunder.  The
Committee  shall  have full  authority  to  decide  whether  to make a loan or  guarantee  or to permit a  deferral
hereunder and to determine the amount,  terms and provisions of any such loan or guarantee,  including the interest
rate to be charged in respect of any such  loan(s),  whether the  loan(s)  are to be made with or without  recourse
against  the borrower, the collateral or other security, if any, securing the repayment of the
loan(s), the terms on which the loan(s) are to be repaid and the conditions, if
any, under which the loan(s) may be forgiven. If the Committee has made or
arranged a loan or guarantee or deferred payment, the Committee may, in its
discretion, require immediate payment of such deferred amount or immediate
release of such loan or guarantee if the Participant&#146;s Continuous Status as
a Participant terminates or if the Participant sells or otherwise transfers the
Participant&#146;s Shares pursuant to such deferral, loan or guarantee.</FONT></p>

GENERAL</U>.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event of a corporate  event or  transaction  involving  the Company  (including,
without   limitation,   any  stock  dividend,   stock  split,   extraordinary   cash  dividend,   recapitalization,
reorganization,  merger, consolidation,  split-up, spin-off,  combination or exchange of shares), the authorization
limits  under  Section 5.1 and 5.4 shall be  adjusted  proportionately,  and the  Committee  may adjust  Options to
preserve the benefits or potential  benefits of the Options.  Action by the Committee may include:  (i)  adjustment
of the number and kind of shares which may be delivered  under the Plan;  (ii) adjustment of the number and kind of
shares subject to outstanding  Options;  (iii)  adjustment of the exercise price of outstanding  Options;  and (iv)
any other adjustments that the Committee  determines to be equitable.  In addition,  the Committee may, in its sole
discretion,  provide (i) that  Options  will be settled in cash rather than Stock,  (ii) that  Options  will become
immediately  vested  and  exercisable  and will  expire  after a  designated  period of time to the extent not then
exercised,  (iii) that  Options  will be assumed  by another  party to a  transaction  or  otherwise  be  equitably
converted or substituted  in connection  with such  transaction,  (iv) that  outstanding  Options may be settled by
payment in cash or cash equivalents  equal to the excess of the Fair Market Value of the underlying  Stock, as of a
specified date associated with the  transaction,  over the exercise price of the Option,  or (v) any combination of
the foregoing.  The Committee's  determination need not be uniform and may be different for different  Participants
whether or not such  Participants  are  similarly  situated.  Without  limiting  the  foregoing,  in the event of a
subdivision of the outstanding  Stock  (stock-split),  a declaration of a dividend payable in shares of Stock, or a
combination or  consolidation of the outstanding  Stock into a lesser number of shares,  the  authorization  limits
under  Section 5.1 and 5.4 shall  automatically  be adjusted  proportionately,  and the Shares then subject to each
Option  shall  automatically  be  adjusted  proportionately  without  any change in the  aggregate  purchase  price
therefore.</FONT></p>>

NO RIGHTS TO OPTIONS;  NON-UNIFORM  DETERMINATIONS</U>.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No Participant  or any Eligible  Participant
shall  have any claim to be granted  any  Option  under the Plan.  Neither  the  Company,  its  Affiliates  nor the
Committee is obligated to treat Participants or Eligible  Participants  uniformly,  and  determinations  made under
the Plan may be made by the Committee  selectively  among  Eligible  Participants  who receive,  or are eligible to

<p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>11.2.    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>
NO STOCKHOLDER  RIGHTS</U>.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No Option gives a Participant  any of the rights of a stockholder of the

<p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>11.3.    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>
WITHHOLDING</U>.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company or any  Affiliate  shall have the  authority and the right to deduct or
withhold,  or require a Participant to remit to the Company,  an amount  sufficient to satisfy Federal,  state, and
local taxes  (including  the  Participant's  FICA  obligation)  required by law to be withheld  with respect to any
exercise,  lapse of restriction  or other taxable event arising as a result of the Plan. If Shares are  surrendered
to the Company to satisfy  withholding  obligations in excess of the minimum  withholding  obligation,  such Shares
must  have  been  held by the  Participant  as fully  vested  shares  for at least  six  months.  With  respect  to
withholding  required upon any taxable event under the Plan,  the Committee  may, at the time the Option is granted
or  thereafter,  require or permit that any such  withholding  requirement  be  satisfied,  in whole or in part, by
withholding  from the Option  Shares  having a Fair Market  Value on the date of  withholding  equal to the minimum
amount (and not any  greater  amount)  required  to be  withheld  for tax  purposes,  all in  accordance  with such
procedures as the Committee establishes.</FONT></p>

Company or any Affiliate to terminate any  Participant's  employment or status as an officer,  director  consultant
or advisor at any time, nor confer upon any  Participant any right to continue as an employee,  officer,  director,

deferred  compensation.  With respect to any payments not yet made to a Participant pursuant to an Option,  nothing
contained in the Plan or any Option  Certificate  shall give the Participant any rights that are greater than those
of a general creditor of the Company or any Affiliate.</FONT></p>

<p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>11.6.    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>

shall be  indemnified  and held  harmless by the Company  from any loss,  cost,  liability,  or expense that may be
imposed upon or reasonably incurred by such member in connection with or resulting from any
claim,  action,  suit,  or  proceeding to which such member may be a party or in which he may be involved by reason
of any action or failure to act under the Plan and  against  and from any and all  amounts  paid by such  member in
satisfaction  of  judgment  in such  action,  suit,  or  proceeding  against  him  provided he gives the Company an
opportunity,  at its own  expense,  to handle and defend the same before he  undertakes  to handle and defend it on
his  own  behalf.  The  foregoing  right  of  indemnification  shall  not be  exclusive  of  any  other  rights  of
indemnification  to which such persons may be entitled under the Company's  Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws, as
a matter of law, or otherwise, or any power that the Company may have to indemnify them or hold them harmless.</FONT></p>

         Exchange or under any  foreign,  Federal,  state or local law or  practice,  or the consent or approval of
         any  governmental  regulatory  body, is necessary or desirable as a condition  of, or in connection  with,

         be required to issue or deliver any  certificate  or  certificates  for Shares under the Plan prior to the
         Committee's  determination  that all related  requirements  have been  fulfilled.  The Company shall in no
         event be obligated  to register any  securities  pursuant to the 1933 Act or  applicable  state or foreign
         law or to take any other  action in order to cause the  issuance  and  delivery  of such  certificates  to
