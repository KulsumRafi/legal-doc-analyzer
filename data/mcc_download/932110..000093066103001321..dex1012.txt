                 -----------------------------------------------

                   SALARY CONTINUATION AND SEVERANCE AGREEMENT

                 -----------------------------------------------

1.0  PARTIES AND DATE

     1.1 Parties. The parties to this salary continuation and consulting
agreement (this "agreement") are Kitty Hawk, Inc. ("Kitty Hawk"), with its
principal place of business located at 1515 W. 20th Street, P.O. Box 612787, DFW
International Airport, Texas 75261, with a fax number of (972) 456-2449, and
James R. Craig ("Craig"), who resides at 6000 Highland Hills Lane, Colleyville,
Texas 76034.

     1.2 Date. This agreement is dated and effective November 4, 2002.

2.0  RECITATIONS AND ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

     2.1 Previous Employment. Craig was the Vice President and General Counsel
of Kitty Hawk, and a member of its Board of Directors, and voluntarily resigned
all of his offices on November 4, 2002. Craig has considerable knowledge and
experience related to the business of Kitty Hawk as a result of his prior
affiliation with Kitty Hawk as an employee; and Kitty Hawk desires to recognize
the valuable and meritorious services performed for Kitty Hawk by Craig during
the many years in which he served Kitty Hawk. This agreement supersedes,
modifies and restates all previous agreements between Craig and Kitty Hawk.

3.0  TERMS OF SALARY CONTINUATION

     3.1 Compensation. As severance compensation, Kitty Hawk will pay Craig six
(6) months worth of what was Craig's basic annual compensation at time of his
resignation, which was $225,000.00. This severance shall be payable in equal
semi-monthly installments, the first being payable November 15, 2002, and the
last being payable April 30, 2003, it being understood that Kitty Hawk shall
have the right to deduct therefrom, if required or deemed advisable, all taxes
which may be required to be deducted and withheld under any provision of
applicable law (including but not limited to social security payments, federal
income tax withholding and any other required deductions).

     3.2 Medical Insurance. For a period of six (6) months ending April 30,
2003, Kitty Hawk shall exert reasonable efforts to cause Craig to be covered
under Kitty Hawk's medical and hospitalization insurance coverage, at no cost to
Craig, and such coverage shall be at least substantially equivalent to the
coverage that is was provided to Craig under Kitty Hawk's employee medical plans
at the time of his resignation. The insurance described in this paragraph shall
be provided only if coverage is permitted by the terms of Kitty Hawk's medical
and hospitalization insurance policy as in effect at any applicable time
hereunder. If it is determined that Craig is not eligible to be covered by Kitty
Hawk's medical and hospitalization insurance policy, Kitty Hawk agrees to pay
Craig's COBRA premiums for as long as he otherwise would be entitled to the
insurance coverage provided in this P. 3.2.

     3.3 Transitional Obligations and Office Access. Craig agrees to use his
reasonable efforts to assist Kitty Hawk in a successful and smooth transition of
the oversight of the legal, human resources and security functions of Kitty Hawk
to those individuals as designated by Kitty Hawk's Chief Executive Officer.
Craig shall be allowed to maintain his office at Kitty Hawk through December 3,
2002, and during such period shall have the same access to Kitty Hawk's systems,
information and files that was available to him before his resignation.
Thereafter, Craig shall have, with the consent of Kitty Hawk's Chief Executive
Officer or such person as he shall designate (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld), access to Kitty Hawk's files, documents and other records, regardless
of format, that he determines to be reasonably related to (i) Craig's work done
on behalf of Kitty Hawk and (ii) the defense of the lawsuit filed against him by
M. Tom Christopher.

     3.4  Proprietary information.

     A.   Craig shall diligently safeguard Kitty Hawk's proprietary information
          and shall surrender to Kitty Hawk or destroy all written or recorded
          evidence of Kitty Hawk's proprietary information, and shall return any
          Kitty Hawk property in Craig's possession, once the Christopher
          litigation has concluded.

     B.   Craig shall never disclose, disseminate or utilize Kitty Hawk's
          proprietary information unless Kitty Hawk's chief executive officer
          expressly authorizes the disclosure, dissemination or utilization in
          writing, except to the extent reasonably necessary for his defense of
          the Christopher litigation, and then only consistently with the
          applicable rules of procedure governing the litigation and with the
          Delaware General Corporation Law and Kitty Hawk's certificate of
          incorporation.

     C.   For the purpose of this agreement, the term "proprietary information"
          shall specifically not include: (a) information that is now in or
          hereafter enters


Salary Continuation and Severance Agreement                               Page 2

<PAGE>


          the public domain without a breach of this agreement by Craig; (b)
          information Craig knew already prior to the time of his employment by
          Kitty Hawk; (c) information that is obtained, after the date of
          Craig's departure from Kitty Hawk, by Craig from any third party that
          is lawfully in possession of such information, but only if such
          disclosure of information to Craig does not violate any contractual or
          legal obligation to Kitty Hawk on the part of such third party or does
          not breach a confidential relationship of such third party to Kitty
          Hawk; and (d) information required or requested to be disclosed by
          court order, subpoena, data request or other legal process or by
          applicable regulatory authorities; provided, however, that Craig
          provide Kitty Hawk with prompt written notice of any such request or
          requirement so that Kitty Hawk may seek a protective order or other
          appropriate remedy.

     D.   The covenants and agreements of Craig set forth in this P. 3.4 are of
          a continuing nature and shall survive the expiration, termination or
          cancellation of this agreement regardless of the reason therefor.

     E.   Because of the unique nature of the Confidential Information, Craig
          acknowledges, understands and agrees that Kitty Hawk will suffer
          immediate and irreparable harm if Craig fails to comply with any of
          his obligations under this P. 3.4 of this agreement, and that monetary
          damages will be inadequate to compensate Kitty Hawk for such breach.
          Accordingly, Craig agrees that Kitty Hawk shall, in addition to any
          other remedies available to it at law or in equity, be entitled to
          temporary, preliminary, and permanent injunctive relief to enforce the
          terms of P. 3.4 without the necessity of proving inadequacy of legal
          remedies or irreparable harm.
