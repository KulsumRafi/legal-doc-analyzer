Mr. Angelo S. Morini
President
Galaxy Nutritional Foods, Inc.
2441 Viscount Row
Orlando, FL  32809

Re:  Special Services Agreement

Dear Angelo:

This letter agreement  supercedes the previous  agreement dated October 24, 2002
between  yourself  and  Galaxy  Nutritional  Foods (the  "Company").  This is to
confirm that you have agreed to author a book promoting the Company's  Veggie(R)
brand  products and the  "Veggiesizing(TM)"  stealth/health  diet. You have also
agreed to promote the book as needed while you are President  and  Vice-Chairman
of the  Board of  Directors  of the  Company  and,  in the  event of a change of
control  of  the  Company,   would   consider   promoting  book  for  additional
compensation.

For these special  services,  the Company agrees to issue you two  non-qualified
option agreements to purchase up to 310,060 shares of the Company's common stock
at an exercise price of $2.05 and 200,000  shares of the Company's  common stock
at an exercise price of $4.08. Both options will vest immediately.

This will also confirm that you are reserving  the right to negotiate  book sale
royalties,  depending on the book's potential profit to the Company, which is at
this time unknown.

Sincerely,                              Agreed to and Accepted by:

/s/ Salvatore J. Furnari                /s/ Angelo S. Morini
----------------------------            ---------------------------
Salvatore J. Furnari, CFO               Angelo S. Morini, President
