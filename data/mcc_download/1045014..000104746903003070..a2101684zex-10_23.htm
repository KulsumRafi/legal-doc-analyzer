the Agreement shall be amended as follows to reflect said changes. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Agreement is hereby amended by deleting "April&nbsp;2, 2002" as the last day on which Bank will make advances under the Line of Credit, and by substituting for said
date "April&nbsp;2, 2003," with such change to be effective upon the execution and delivery to Bank of a promissory note substantially in the form of Exhibit&nbsp;A attached hereto (which
promissory note shall replace and be deemed the Line of Credit Note defined in and made pursuant to the Agreement) and all other contracts, instruments and documents required by Bank to evidence such
change. </FONT></P>

one hundred eighty (180) days with respect to commercial Letters of Credit nor more than one year with respect to standby Letters of Credit, as designated by Borrower; provided however, that no Letter
of Credit shall have an expiration date subsequent to the maturity date of the Line of Credit. The undrawn amount of all Letters of Credit shall be reserved under the Line of Credit and shall not be
available for borrowings thereunder. Each Letter of Credit shall be subject to the additional terms and conditions of the Letter of Credit agreements, applications and any related documents required
by Bank in connection with the issuance thereof. Each draft paid under a Letter of Credit shall be deemed an advance under the Line of Credit and shall be repaid by Borrower in accordance with the
terms and conditions of this letter applicable to such advances; provided however, that if advances under the Line of Credit are not available, for any reason, at the time any draft is paid, then
Borrower shall immediately pay to Bank the full amount of such draft, together with interest thereon from the date such draft is paid to the date such amount is fully repaid by Borrower, at the rate
of interest applicable to advances under the Line of Credit. In such event </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FOR VALUE RECEIVED, the undersigned </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>GameTech International, Inc. and Bingo Technologies Corporation </B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>("Borrower")
promises to pay to the order of WELLS FARGO BANK, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION ("Bank") at its office at </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>Reno RCBO, 5340 Kietzke Lane, Suite 201, Reno, NV
89511</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, or at such other place as the holder hereof may designate, in lawful money of the United States of America and in immediately available funds, the principal sum of </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><B>$10,000,000.00</B></FONT><FONT
SIZE=2>, or so much thereof as may be advanced and be outstanding, with interest thereon, to be computed on each advance from the date of its
disbursement as set forth herein. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>DEFINITIONS:  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As used herein, the following terms shall have the meanings set forth after each, and any other term defined in this Note shall have the meaning set forth at the
place defined: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;"Business
Day" means any day except a Saturday, Sunday or any other day on which commercial banks in Nevada are authorized or required by law to close. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fixed
Rate Term" means a period commencing on a Business Day and continuing for </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>1, 2 or 3 months</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, as designated by
Borrower, during which all or a portion of the outstanding principal balance of this Note bears interest determined in relation to LIBOR; provided however, that no Fixed Rate Term may be selected for
a principal amount less than </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>$500,000.00</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>; and provided further, that no Fixed Rate Term shall extend beyond the scheduled maturity date hereof. If any
Fixed Rate Term would end
on a day which is not a Business Day, then such Fixed Rate Term shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;"LIBOR"
means the rate per annum (rounded upward, if necessary, to the nearest whole 1/8 of 1%) determined by dividing Base LIBOR by a percentage equal to 100% less any
LIBOR Reserve Percentage. </FONT></P>

<UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Base
LIBOR" means the rate per annum for United States dollar deposits quoted by Bank as the Inter-Bank Market Offered Rate, with the understanding that such rate is
quoted by Bank for the purpose of calculating effective rates of interest for loans making reference thereto, on the first day of a Fixed Rate Term for delivery of funds on said date for a period of
time approximately equal to the number of days in such Fixed Rate Term and in an amount approximately equal to the principal amount to which such Fixed Rate Term applies. Borrower understands and
agrees that Bank may base its quotation of the Inter-Bank Market Offered Rate upon such offers or other market indicators of the Inter-Bank Market as Bank in its discretion deems appropriate
including, but not limited to, the rate offered for U.S. dollar deposits on the London Inter-Bank Market. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;"LIBOR
Reserve Percentage" means the reserve percentage prescribed by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (or any successor ) for "Eurocurrency
Liabilities" (as defined in Regulation&nbsp;D of the Federal Reserve Board, as amended), adjusted by Bank for expected changes in such reserve percentage during the applicable Fixed Rate Term. </FONT></P>

</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;"Prime
Rate" means at any time the rate of interest most recently announced within Bank at its principal office as its Prime Rate, with the understanding that the Prime
Rate is one of Bank's base rates and serves as the basis upon which effective rates of interest are calculated for those loans </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><I>Interest.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> The outstanding principal balance of this Note shall bear interest (computed on the basis of a </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><B>360</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>-day year, actual days elapsed) either (i)&nbsp;at a
fluctuating rate per annum </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>equal to </B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>the Prime
Rate in effect from time to time, or (ii)&nbsp;at a fixed rate per annum determined by Bank to be </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>2.00000% </B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> above LIBOR in effect on the first day of
the applicable Fixed Rate Term. When interest is determined in relation to the Prime Rate, each change in the rate of interest hereunder shall become effective on the date each Prime Rate change is
announced within Bank. With respect to each LIBOR selection option
selected hereunder, Bank is hereby authorized to note the date, principal amount, interest rate and Fixed Rate Term applicable thereto and any payments made thereon on Bank's books and records (either
manually or by electronic entry) and/or on any schedule attached to this Note, which notations shall be prima facie evidence of the accuracy of the information noted. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><I>Selection of Interest Rate Options. </I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>At any time any portion of this Note bears interest determined in relation to LIBOR,
it may be continued by Borrower at the end of the Fixed Rate Term applicable thereto so that all or a portion thereof bears interest determined in relation to the Prime Rate or to LIBOR for a new
Fixed Rate Term designated by Borrower. At any time any portion of this Note bears interest determined in relation to the Prime Rate, Borrower may convert all or a portion thereof so that it bears
interest determined in relation to LIBOR for a Fixed Rate Term designated by Borrower. At such time as Borrower requests an advance hereunder or wishes to select a LIBOR option for all or a portion of
the outstanding principal balance hereof, and at the end of each Fixed Rate Term, Borrower shall give Bank notice specifying: (i)&nbsp;the interest rate option selected by Borrower; (ii)&nbsp;the
principal amount subject thereto; and (iii)&nbsp;for each LIBOR selection, the length of the applicable Fixed Rate Term. Any such notice may be given by telephone (or such other electronic method as
Bank may permit) so long as, with respect to each LIBOR selection, (A)&nbsp;if requested by Bank, Borrower provides to Bank written confirmation thereof not later than three (3) Business Days after
such notice is given, and (B)&nbsp;such notice is given to Bank prior to 10:00&nbsp;a.m. on the first day of the Fixed Rate Term, or at a later time during any Business Day if Bank, at it's sole
option but without obligation to do so, accepts Borrower's notice and quotes a fixed rate to Borrower. If Borrower does not immediately accept a fixed rate when quoted by Bank, the quoted rate shall
expire and any subsequent LIBOR request from Borrower shall be subject to a redetermination by Bank of the applicable fixed rate. If no specific designation of interest is made at the time any advance
is requested hereunder or at the end of any Fixed Rate Term, Borrower shall be deemed to have made a Prime Rate interest selection for such advance or the principal amount to which such Fixed Rate
Term applied. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><I>Taxes and Regulatory Costs. </I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>Borrower shall pay to Bank immediately upon demand, in addition to any other amounts due or
to become due hereunder, any and all (i)&nbsp;withholdings, interest equalization taxes, stamp taxes or other taxes (except income and franchise taxes) imposed by any domestic or foreign
governmental authority and related in any manner to LIBOR, and (ii)&nbsp;future, supplemental, emergency or other changes in the LIBOR Reserve Percentage, assessment rates imposed by the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation, or similar requirements or costs imposed by any domestic or foreign governmental authority or resulting from compliance by Bank with any request or directive (whether or
not having the force of law) from any central bank or other governmental authority and related in any manner to LIBOR to the extent they are not included in the calculation of LIBOR. In determining
which of the foregoing are attributable to any LIBOR option available to Borrower hereunder, any reasonable allocation made by Bank among its operations shall be conclusive and binding upon Borrower. </FONT></P>

its outstanding borrowings, and reborrow, subject to all of the limitations, terms and conditions of this Note and of any document executed in connection with or governing this Note; provided however,
that the total outstanding borrowings under this Note shall not at any time exceed the principal amount stated above. The unpaid principal balance of this obligation at any time shall be the total
amounts advanced hereunder by the holder hereof less the amount of principal payments made hereon by or for any Borrower, which balance may be endorsed hereon from time to time by the holder. The

any person requesting an advance is or has been authorized by any Borrower. </FONT></P>

fee which is the sum of the discounted monthly differences for each month from the month of prepayment through the month in which such Fixed Rate Term matures, calculated as follows for each such
