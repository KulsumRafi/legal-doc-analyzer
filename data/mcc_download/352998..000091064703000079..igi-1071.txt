                               PROMISSORY NOTE

$245,556                                                      Trenton,
                                                              New Jersey

      IGI, INC. (the "Borrower") a corporation organized and existing under
the laws of the State of Delaware acknowledges itself indebted and for
value received hereby promises to pay the order of the NEW JERSEY ECONOMIC
DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY (the "Authority") and its successors and assigns, the
principal sum of Two Hundred Forty-Five Thousand Five Hundred Fifty-Six
Dollars ($245,556), together with interest on the unpaid principal balance
thereof from the date hereof until the Borrower's obligations with respect
to the payment of such sum shall be discharged at a fixed rate of interest
of five percent (5%) per annum. Interest charges shall be computed
hereunder on the basis of a 360 day year, counting the actual number of
days elapsed.

      This Note is issued to evidence the obligation of the Borrower under
and pursuant to, and shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
the terms and conditions of the Loan Agreement (the "Agreement") between
the Authority and the Borrower dated as of January 10, 2002 for the
repayment of the loan made by the Authority to the Borrower thereunder and
payment of interest thereon. Terms referred to herein have the same meaning
as defined in the Agreement. This Note is secured by a mortgage bearing
even date herewith, executed by the Borrower as Mortgagor and delivered to
the Authority as Mortgagee on real property located in Buena, New Jersey.

      This Note is payable in one hundred twenty (120) equal monthly
installments of principal and interest in the sum of $2,612.95 commencing
on February 1, 2002 and on the first day of each succeeding month and
terminating if not sooner paid, as herein provided on January 1, 2012. Such
installments shall be applied first to payment of interest then due on the
unpaid principal amount and the remaining balance of each such installment
to be applied to the payment and reduction of the unpaid principal amount
of this Note. The amount payable as the final installment may be such
greater or lesser amount as shall be equal to the actual principal amount
of this Note remaining unpaid together with interest thereon then due and
unpaid. It is specifically understood and agreed that the Borrower shall
make payments on this Note based on amounts actually disbursed pursuant to
the Agreement.

      Payments hereon are to be made in lawful money of the United States
of America to the New Jersey Economic Development Authority (P13379), P.O.
Box 18641, Newark, New Jersey 07191-8641, or such

other place as the Authority may designate, on each due date provided above,
in an amount which will equal the amount payable as interest and principal on
this Note.

      The Borrower agrees to make the payments on this Note on the dates
and in the amounts specified herein and in the Agreement and in addition
agrees to make such other payments as are required pursuant to the
Agreement. A late charge of five percent (5%) of the monthly payment shall
be due and payable on any monthly payment past due seven (7) days or more.
However, in the event that this late charge is found unenforceable by a
court of law, the Borrower shall pay actual damages to the Authority which
shall include but not be limited to the loss of use of the delinquent
payment(s) and administrative costs in monitoring the default by the
Borrower. Administrative costs include but are not limited to attempts to
contact the Borrower via written and letter correspondence, generating and
reviewing the delinquency reports, evaluating the delinquent account,
evaluating the credit file, entering relevant information into the
Authority's file and/or computer, relaying information to management and
different departments, notifying and reporting to management and different
departments. In the event of default in the Agreement, the principal of and
interest on this Note may be declared immediately due and payable as
provided in the Agreement. This Note may be canceled, amended or
supplemented as provided in the Agreement.

      The Borrower may prepay this Note in whole at any time or in part on
any payment date without penalty. Partial payments shall be applied to the
last maturing payments due on this Note, shall be in one or more increments
of the monthly amount due, shall not extend or postpone the due date of any
subsequent monthly installment or change the amounts of such installments.
In any such case, the final payment on this Note shall be a sum sufficient,
together with other funds deposited with the Authority and available for
such purpose, to redeem all of this Note then outstanding at the principal
amount thereof plus accrued interest to the date of payment and to pay all
reasonable and necessary fees and expenses of the Authority accrued and to
accrue through final payment for this Note. At the acceleration,
termination or expiration of the term of this Note and following full
payment of this Note and all other fees and charges in accordance with the
provisions of the Agreement, the Authority shall deliver to the Borrower
any documents and take such actions as may be necessary to effectuate the
cancellation of this Note and evidence the termination of the Agreement.

      Notwithstanding the above, the actual principal amount of this Note
remaining unpaid together with interest thereon shall be immediately due
and payable upon the transfer of ownership of the Project Site.
