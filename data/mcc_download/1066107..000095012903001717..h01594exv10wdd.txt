                           Dated as of March 13, 2003

      EL PASO CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation (the "BORROWER"), the banks,

(collectively, the "LEAD ARRANGERS") agree as follows:

                             PRELIMINARY STATEMENTS:

1.    The Borrower and certain of its Subsidiaries are parties to a certain
      minority equity interest transaction (such transaction, the "RED RIVER
      TRANSACTION") involving, among other parties, Red River Investors L.L.C.,
      a limited liability company ("RED RIVER"), whereby Red River purchased a
      membership interest in Trinity River Associates, L.L.C. ("TRINITY"), and
      Trinity made advances pursuant to the Second Amended and Restated Sponsor
      Subsidiary Credit Agreement, originally dated as of June 30, 1999 and
      amended and restated as of November 22, 1999 and March 29, 2002 (the
      "SPONSOR SUBSIDIARY CREDIT AGREEMENT"), to certain subsidiaries of the
      Borrower (such subsidiaries, the "SPONSOR SUBSIDIARIES").

2.    The Sponsor Subsidiaries intend to refinance their obligations under the
      Sponsor Subsidiary Credit Agreement (the "SPONSOR SUBSIDIARY
      OBLIGATIONS").

3.    In connection therewith, the Borrower intends to make advances (the
      "SUBSIDIARY Loans") to the Subsidiary Borrowers (as hereinafter defined),
      which are Subsidiaries of certain of the Sponsor Subsidiaries, whereby the
      proceeds thereof will, through intermediate distributions and other
      payments to one or more Sponsor Subsidiaries, be applied to refinance the
      Sponsor Subsidiary Obligations.

4.    The Subsidiary Borrowers (as hereinafter defined) will secure their
      obligations owing to the Borrower under the Subsidiary Loans with
      substantially all of their assets (such assets being the "SUBSIDIARY
      COLLATERAL"), and the Subsidiary Loan Parties (as hereinafter defined)
      will guarantee the obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement in
      favor of the Lenders. The foregoing refinancing and other transactions are
      referred to herein as the "REFINANCING TRANSACTION".

5.    The Borrower desires to finance the Refinancing Transaction through (a)
      the issuance of debt securities or a syndicated loan facility
      (collectively, the "TAKE-OUT SECURITIES") of the Borrower or the
      Subsidiary Borrowers or one or more of their respective Affiliates, or (b)
      to the extent the Borrower is unable to finance the Refinancing
      Transaction with the Take-Out Securities on or prior to the Closing Date,
      a Senior Secured Interim Term Loan Facility of $1,200,000,000 (the "LOAN
      FACILITY"), to be made available to the Borrower by the Initial Lenders as
      interim financing to the Take-Out Securities and to be secured by a
      collateral assignment by the Borrower of the Subsidiary Loans and
      Subsidiary Collateral to effectively guarantee and provide credit support
      for, and ensure the Lenders against loss in respect of, the Borrower's
      obligations in respect of the


                                       2

      Loan Facility. The Initial Lenders have indicated their willingness to
      make available the Loan Facility on the terms and conditions of this

Advance, and (ii) with regard to any other amount, 2% above the applicable Base
Rate plus the Base Rate Margin, in each case payable in arrears on the date such
amount shall be paid in full and on demand.

      (c) Additional Cost for Eurodollar Reserves. If any Lender shall determine
in good faith that reserves under regulations of the Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System are required to be maintained by it in respect of, or a
portion of its costs of maintaining reserves under such regulations is properly
attributable to, one or more of its Advances, the Borrower shall pay to such
Lender additional interest on the unpaid principal amount of each such Advance
to it (other than any such additional interest accruing to a particular Lender
in respect of periods prior to the 30th day preceding the date notice of such
interest is given by such Lender as provided in this Section 2.03), payable on
the same day or days on which interest is payable on such Advance, at an
interest rate per annum equal at all times during each Interest Period for such
Advance to the excess of (i) the rate obtained by dividing the LIBO Rate for
such Interest Period by a percentage equal to 100% minus the Eurodollar Reserve
Percentage, if any, for such Lender for such Interest Period over (ii) the LIBO
Rate for such Interest Period. The amount of such additional interest (if any)
shall be determined by each Lender, and such Lender shall furnish written notice
of the amount of such additional interest to the Borrower and the Agent, which
notice shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.

      SECTION 2.04. Certain Fees. (a) The Borrower shall pay the Facility Fee in
arrears on each Payment Date during the term of this Agreement and on the
Termination Date.

      (b) The Borrower shall pay certain other fees pursuant to the terms of the
Fee Letter.

SECTION 2.05. Repayment of the Loan. On each of (a) the last Business Day of
June 2004, and (b) the last Business day of September 2004, the Borrower shall
repay a principal amount equal to $300,000,000 of the then outstanding Loan. The
outstanding principal balance of the Loan shall be repaid in full by the
Borrower on the Scheduled Maturity Date.

      SECTION 2.06. Prepayments of the Advance. (a) Optional. The Borrower may,
at any time, prepay the outstanding principal amount of the Loan in whole or in
part, together with accrued interest, fees and any other amounts payable under
this Agreement to the date of such prepayment on the principal amount prepaid;
provided, however, that (i) each partial prepayment shall be in an aggregate
principal amount of not less than $1,000,000 and (ii) in the event of any such
prepayment on a day other than the last day of an Interest Period, the Borrower
shall pay to the Agent for the account of the affected


                                       23
<PAGE>

Lender or Lenders, on the last day of such Interest Period, any amount owing
pursuant to Section 9.04(c) in connection with such prepayment.

      (b) Mandatory. The Borrower shall prepay principal amounts outstanding
under the Loan, together with accrued interest to the date of such prepayment on
the principal amount so prepaid, on the date of receipt of the following and in
the amounts set forth below:

            (i) 100% of the proceeds of each optional or mandatory prepayment or
      repayment in respect of the principal amount of the Subsidiary Loans
      (including as a result of the issuance of the Take-Out Securities),

            (ii) 100% of the Net Cash Proceeds of (A) all equity or
      equity-linked offerings or sales of Equity Interests by or of any Chain
      Subsidiary, and (B) such offerings by the Borrower or its Affiliates that
      are exchangeable into Equity Interests of any Subsidiary Loan Party,
      excluding in each case of clause (A) and (B), Net Cash Proceeds of any
      capital contribution to any Subsidiary Loan Party by existing holders of
      Equity Interests thereof,

            (iii) 100% of the Net Cash Proceeds of issuances of Indebtedness of
      any Chain Subsidiary (including as a result of the issuance of the
      Take-Out Securities),

            (iv) 100% of the Net Cash Proceeds of incurrences or issuances of
      Indebtedness of the Borrower or that are primarily based on the credit of
      the Borrower, excluding Indebtedness permitted to be incurred pursuant to
      Section 5.02(b) (other than clause (v) thereof); and

            (v) 100% of the Net Cash Proceeds of the Take-Out Securities (to the
      extent not otherwise covered by clauses (i) through (iv) above).

      (c) Notice. Each prepayment shall be accompanied by written notice to the

optional or mandatory prepayment of the principal amount of the Loan made by the
Borrower shall be credited against the unpaid principal amount thereof as
follows:

            (i) if made during the period commencing on the Closing Date and
      ending on the day 120 days after the Closing Date, shall be made at 99.25%
      of the aggregate amount of the Loans being prepaid;

            (ii) if made during the period commencing on the day 121 days after
      the Closing Date and ending on the day 240 days after the Closing Date,
      shall be made at 99.75% of the aggregate amount of the Loans being
      prepaid; and

            (iii) commencing with prepayments made on the day 241 days after the
      Closing Date, each prepayment of principal shall be made at 100.0% of the
      aggregate amount of the Loans being prepaid.

            (iv) No Lender shall have the right to decline a prepayment
      hereunder.

      SECTION 2.07. Increased Costs; Capital Adequacy, Etc. (a) If, due to
either (i) the introduction after the date of this Agreement of or any change
after the date of this Agreement (including


                                       24
<PAGE>

any change by way of imposition or increase of reserve requirements or
assessments other than those referred to in the definition of "EURODOLLAR
RESERVE Percentage") in or in the interpretation of any law or regulation or
(ii) the compliance with any guideline or request issued or made after the date
of this Agreement from or by any central bank or other governmental authority
(whether or not having the force of law), in each case above, there shall be any
increase in the cost to any Lender of agreeing to make, fund or maintain, or of
making, funding or maintaining, Advances, then the Borrower shall from time to
time, upon demand by such Lender (with a copy of such demand to the Agent), pay
to the Agent for the account of such Lender additional amounts sufficient to
reimburse such Lender for all such increased costs (except those costs incurred
more than 60 days prior to the date of such demand; for the purposes hereof any
cost or expense allocable to a period prior to the publication or effective date
of such an introduction, change, guideline or request shall be deemed to be
incurred on the later of such publication or effective date). Each Lender agrees
to use its best efforts promptly to notify the Borrower of any event referred to
in clause (i) or (ii) above, provided that the failure to give such notice shall
not affect the rights of any Lender under this Section 2.07(a) (except as
otherwise expressly provided above in this Section 2.07(a)). A certificate as to
the amount of such increased cost, submitted to the Borrower and the Agent by
such Lender, shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest
error. Each Lender agrees to use its best efforts (including a reasonable effort
to change its Lending Office or to transfer its affected Advances to an
affiliate of such Lender) to avoid, or minimize the amount of, any demand for
payment from the Borrower under this Section 2.07(a).

      (b) If either (i) the introduction of or any change in or in the
interpretation of any law or regulation or (ii) compliance by any Lender with
any guideline or request from any central bank or other governmental authority
(whether or not having the force of law) affects or would affect the amount of
capital required or expected to be maintained by such Lender or any corporation
controlling such Lender and such Lender determines that the amount of such
capital is increased as a result of such Lender's obligations under this
Agreement, then, within ten days after demand, and delivery to the Borrower of
the certificate referred to in the last sentence of this subsection (b) by such
Lender (with a copy of such demand to the Agent), the Borrower shall pay to the
Agent for the account of such Lender, from time to time as specified by such
Lender, additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Lender or such
corporation in the light of such circumstances, to the extent that such Lender
reasonably determines such increase in capital to be allocable to the existence
of such Lender's obligations hereunder (except any such increase in capital
incurred more than, or compensation attributable to the period before, 90 days
prior to the date of such demand; provided, that, for the purposes of this
subsection (b), any increase in capital allocable to, or compensation
attributable to, a period prior to the publication or effective date of any such
introduction, change, guideline or request shall be deemed to be incurred on the
later of such publication or effective date). Each Lender agrees to use its best
efforts promptly to notify the Borrower of any event referred to in clause (i)
or (ii) above, provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect
the rights of any Lender under this subsection (b) (except as otherwise
expressly provided above in this subsection (b)). A certificate in reasonable
detail as to the basis for, and the amount of, such compensation submitted to
the Borrower by such Lender shall, in the absence of manifest error, be
conclusive and binding for all purposes hereunder.

      (c) In the event that any Lender shall change its Lending Office and such
change results (at the time of such change) in increased costs to such Lender,
the Borrower shall not be liable to such Lender for such increased costs
incurred by such Lender to the extent, but only to the extent, that such
increased costs shall exceed the increased costs which such Lender would have
incurred if the Lending Office of such Lender had not been so changed, but,
subject to subsection (a) above and to Section 2.08, nothing herein shall
require any Lender to change its Lending Office for any reason.

      SECTION 2.08. Interest Rate Determination; Late Payments; Payments and
Computations. (a) The Borrower shall make each payment hereunder not later than
1:00 P.M.


                                       25
<PAGE>


(New York City time) on the day when due in U.S. dollars to the Agent at the
Agent's Account in same day funds. Any payment received after 1:00 P.M. (New
York City time) on the day when due shall be applied on the next following
Business Day.

      (b) All computations of interest and fees hereunder shall be made on the
basis of a year of 360 days for the actual number of days (including the first
day but excluding the last day) elapsed (except that where interest is
calculated by reference to the Base Rate, the computation of interest hereunder
shall be made on the basis of a year of 365 days or 366 days, as applicable).
Each determination by the Agent of an interest rate hereunder shall be
conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.

      (c) Whenever any payment hereunder shall be stated to be due on a day
other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding
Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the
computation of the payment of interest or fees, as the case may be; provided,
however, in the case of any payment of any LIBOR Advance, if such extension
would cause payment to be made in the next following calendar month, such
payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day.

      SECTION 2.09. *Taxes. (a) Any and all payments by the Borrower hereunder
or under the Borrower Notes to each Indemnified Party shall be made, in
accordance with Section 2.08, free and clear of and without deduction for any
and all Taxes, excluding all Excluded Taxes. If the Borrower shall be required
by law to deduct any Indemnified Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable
hereunder or under any Borrower Note to any Indemnified Party, (i) the sum
payable shall be increased as may be necessary so that after making all required
deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under
this Section 2.09) such Indemnified Party receives an amount equal to the sum it
would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Borrower shall
make or cause to be made such deductions and (iii) the Borrower shall pay or
cause to be paid the full amount deducted to the relevant taxation authority or
other authority in accordance with applicable law, provided that the Borrower
shall not be required to pay any additional amount (and shall be relieved of any
liability with respect thereto) pursuant to this subsection (a) to any
Indemnified Party that either (A) on the date such Lender became an Indemnified
Party hereunder, (I) was not entitled to submit a U.S. Internal Revenue Service
form W8-ECI (relating to such Indemnified Party, and entitling it to a complete
exemption from United States withholding taxes on all amounts to be received by
such Indemnified Party pursuant to this Agreement) and a U.S. Internal Revenue
Service form W8-BEN (relating to all amounts to be received by such Indemnified
Party pursuant to this Agreement) and (II) was not a United States person (as
such term is defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Internal Revenue Code) or (B)
has failed to submit any form or certificate that it was required to file or
provide pursuant to subsection (d) of this Section 2.09 and is entitled to file
or give, as applicable, under applicable law, provided, further, that should an
Indemnified Party become subject to Indemnified Taxes because of its failure to
deliver a form required hereunder, the Borrower shall take such steps as such
Indemnified Party shall reasonably request to assist such Indemnified Party to
recover such Indemnified Taxes, and provided, further, that each Indemnified
Party, with respect to itself, agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the
Borrower from any taxes, penalties, interest and other expenses, costs and
losses incurred or payable by the Borrower as a result of the failure of the
Borrower to comply with its obligations under clause (ii) or (iii) above in
reliance on any form or certificate provided to it by such Indemnified Party
pursuant to this Section 2.09. If any Indemnified Party receives a net credit or
refund in respect of such Indemnified Taxes or amounts so paid by the Borrower,
it shall promptly pay such net credit or refund to the Borrower, provided that
the Borrower agrees to return such net credit or refund if the Indemnified Party
to which such net credit or refund is applicable is required to repay it.

      (b) In addition, the Borrower agrees to pay all Other Taxes.


                                       26
<PAGE>

      (c) The Borrower will indemnify each Indemnified Party and the Agent for
the full amount of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes (including any Indemnified
Taxes or Other Taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this
Section 2.09) paid by such Indemnified Party and any liability (including
penalties, interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto
except as a result of the gross negligence (which shall in any event include the
failure of such Indemnified Party to provide to the Borrower any form or
certificate that it was required to provide pursuant to subsection (d) below) or
willful misconduct of such Indemnified Party, whether or not such Indemnified
Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally asserted. This indemnification
shall be made within 30 days from the date such Indemnified Party makes written
demand therefor.

      (d) On or prior to the date on which each Indemnified Party organized
under the laws of a jurisdiction outside the United States becomes an
Indemnified Party hereunder, such Indemnified Party shall provide the Borrower
with U.S. Internal Revenue Service form W-8ECI or W-8BEN or W-8IMY, as
appropriate, or any successor form prescribed by the U.S. Internal Revenue
Service, certifying that such Indemnified Party is fully exempt from United
States withholding taxes with respect to all payments to be made to such
Indemnified Party hereunder, or other documents satisfactory to the Borrower
indicating that all payments to be made to such Indemnified Party hereunder are
fully exempt from such taxes. Thereafter and from time to time (but only so long
as such Indemnified Party remains lawfully able to do so), each such Indemnified
Party shall submit to the Borrower such additional duly completed and signed
copies of one or the other of such Forms (or such successor Forms as shall be
adopted from time to time by the relevant United States taxing authorities) as
may be (i) notified by the Borrower to such Indemnified Party and (ii) required
under then-current United States law or regulations to avoid United States
withholding taxes on payments in respect of all amounts to be received by such
Indemnified Party pursuant to this Agreement or the Borrower Notes. Upon the
request of the Borrower from time to time, each Indemnified Party that is a
United States person (as such term is defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the
Internal Revenue Code) shall submit to the Borrower a certificate to the effect
that it is such a United States person. If any Indemnified Party determines, as
a result of any change in applicable law, regulation or treaty, or in any
official application or interpretation thereof, that it is unable to submit to
the Borrower any form or certificate that such Indemnified Party is obligated to
submit pursuant to this subsection (d), or that such Indemnified Party is
required to withdraw or cancel any such form or certificate previously
submitted, such Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the Borrower of such
fact.

      (e) Any Indemnified Party claiming any additional amounts payable pursuant
to this Section 2.09 shall use its best efforts (consistent with its internal
policy and legal and regulatory restrictions) to change the jurisdiction of its
Lending Office if the making of such a change would avoid the need for, or
reduce the amount of, any such additional amounts which may thereafter accrue
and would not, in the reasonable judgment of such Indemnified Party, be
otherwise disadvantageous to such Indemnified Party.

      (f) Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement of the
Borrower hereunder, the agreements and obligations of the Borrower and each
Indemnified Party contained in this Section 2.09 shall survive the payment in
full of all principal of and interest on the Loan and under the Borrower Notes.

      (g) Any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding,
any amounts which are payable by the Borrower under this Section 2.09 shall not
be payable under Section 2.07.

      SECTION 2.10. Evidence of Debt. (a) Each Lender shall maintain in
accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the
indebtedness of the Borrower to such Lender


                                       27
<PAGE>

resulting from the Loan, including the amounts of principal and interest payable
and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder.

      (b) The Borrower agrees that, on or before the Closing Date, it shall
execute and deliver to each Initial Lender who shall so request a Borrower Note,
in substantially the form of Exhibit B hereto, payable to the order of such
Initial Lender (or its nominee) in a principal amount equal to such Initial
Lender's Commitment.

      (c) The Register maintained by the Agent pursuant to Section 9.07(c) shall
include a control account, in which shall be recorded (i) the date and amount of
each Advance made hereunder and the Lender to whom the Advance is owing, (ii)
the terms of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to and by it, (iii) the
amount of any principal and interest due and payable or to become due and
payable from the Borrower to each Lender hereunder, and (iv) the amount of any
sum received by the Agent from the Borrower hereunder and distributed to each
Lender hereunder.

      (d) The entries made in the Register shall be, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the
obligations of the Borrower therein recorded conclusive and binding for all
purposes, absent manifest error.

      SECTION 2.11. Change of Lending Office. The Lender agrees that, upon the
occurrence of any event giving rise to the operation of Section 2.03(c), 2.07 or
2.09 with respect to such Lender, such Lender will use reasonable efforts
(consistent with the internal policies of and legal and statutory restrictions
applicable to such Lender) to select a jurisdiction for the Lending Office of
such Lender or change the jurisdiction of such Lending Office so as to avoid the
need for or reduce the amount of any amounts accruing under 2.03(c), Section
2.07 or 2.09; provided that no such selection, change of the jurisdiction of
such Lending Office or assignment shall be made if, in the reasonable judgment
of such Lender, such selection, change or assignment would be disadvantageous to
such Lender.

      SECTION 2.12. Sharing of Payments, Etc. If any Lender shall obtain at any
time any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any
right of set-off, or otherwise, other than as a result of an assignment pursuant
to Section 9.07) (a) on account of Obligations due and payable to such Lender
hereunder and under the Borrower Notes at such time in excess of its ratable
share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such Obligations due and
payable to such Lender at such time to (ii) the aggregate amount of the
Obligations due and payable to all Lenders hereunder and under the Borrower
Notes at such time) of payments on account of the Obligations due and payable to
all Lenders hereunder and under the Borrower Notes at such time obtained by all
the Lenders at such time or (b) on account of Obligations owing (but not due and
payable) to such Lender hereunder and under the Borrower Notes at such time in
excess of its ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of
such Obligations owing to such Lender at such time to (ii) the aggregate amount
of the Obligations owing (but not due and payable) to all Lenders hereunder and
under the Borrower Notes at such time) of payments on account of the Obligations
owing (but not due and payable) to all Lenders hereunder and under the Borrower
Notes at such time obtained by all of the Lenders at such time, such Lender
shall forthwith purchase from the other Lenders such interests or participating
interests in the Obligations due and payable or owing to them, as the case may
be, as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess
payment ratably with each of them; provided, however, that if all or any portion
of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from such purchasing Lender, such
purchase from each other Lender shall be rescinded and such other Lender shall
repay to the purchasing Lender the purchase price to the extent of such Lender's
ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the purchase price paid to
such Lender to (ii) the aggregate purchase price paid to all Lenders) of such
recovery, together with an amount equal to such Lender's ratable share
(according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such other Lender's required
repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender) of
any


                                       28
<PAGE>

interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of
the total amount so recovered. The Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing
an interest or participating interest from another Lender pursuant to this
Section 2.12 may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its
rights of payment (including the right of set-off) with respect to such interest
or participating interest, as the case may be, as fully as if such Lender were
the direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such interest or
participating interest, as the case may be.

      SECTION 2.13. Use of Proceeds. The Borrower shall use the proceeds of the
Loan only to make the Subsidiary Loans pursuant to the Subsidiary Borrower
Credit Agreement.

                                  Article III

      Subsidiaries is in compliance with all laws, rules, regulations and orders
      of any governmental authority applicable to it or its property except
      where the failure to comply, individually or in the aggregate, would not
      in the reasonable judgment of the Borrower be expected to result in a
      Material Adverse Effect,


                                       35
<PAGE>

      provided that any alleged failure to comply with such laws, rules,
      regulations and orders that are disclosed in the Borrower's 8-K's, 10-Q's
      or 10-K's, or materials relating to proxies, in each case filed with the
      SEC prior to the Closing Date shall not be deemed at any time to be
      expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

            (g) Litigation. There is no action, suit or proceeding pending, or
      to the knowledge of the Borrower threatened, against or involving the
      Borrower or any Subsidiary Loan Party in any court, or before any
      arbitrator of any kind, or before or by any Governmental Authority,
      existing as of the Closing Date which, in the reasonable judgment of the
      Borrower (taking into account the exhaustion of all appeals), would have a
      Material Adverse Effect, provided that any such action, suit or proceeding
      that has been disclosed in the Company's 8-K's, 10-Q's or 10-K's, or
      materials relating to proxies, in each case filed with the SEC prior to
      the Closing Date shall not be deemed at any time to be expected to have a
      Material Adverse Effect or which purports to affect the legality, validity
      or enforceability of any Operative Document.

            (h) Taxes. Each of Borrower and each Subsidiary Loan Party has duly
      filed all tax returns required to be filed by it, and has duly paid and
      discharged all taxes, assessments and governmental charges upon it or
      against its properties now due and payable, the failure to file or pay
      which, as applicable, would have a Material Adverse Effect, unless and to
      the extent only that the same are being contested in good faith and by
      appropriate proceedings by the Borrower or such Subsidiary Loan Party, as
      applicable.

            (i) Title to Property. Each of the Borrower and each Subsidiary Loan
      Party has good title to its respective properties and assets, free and
      clear of all mortgages, liens and encumbrances, except for mortgages,
      liens and encumbrances (including covenants, restrictions, rights,
      easements and minor irregularities in title) which do not materially
      interfere with the business or operations of such Person as presently
      conducted or which are permitted by Section 5.02(a) and except that no
      representation or warranty is being made with respect to Margin Stock.

            (j) ERISA. (i) No Termination Event has occurred or is reasonably
      expected to occur with respect to any Plan which, with the giving of
      notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute an Event of Default
      under Section 6.01(h) hereof.

                  (ii) Each Plan has complied with the applicable provisions of
            ERISA and the Code where the failure to so comply would reasonably
            be expected to result in an aggregate liability that would exceed
            10% of the Net Worth of the Borrower.

                  (iii) The statement of assets and liabilities of each Plan and
            the statements of changes in fund balance and in financial position,

            benefits, for the most recent plan year for which an accountant's
            report with respect to such Plan has been prepared, copies of which
            report have been furnished to the Agent fairly present the financial
            condition of such Plan as at such date and the results of operations
            of such Plan for the plan year ended on such date.

                  (iv) Neither the Borrower nor any ERISA Affiliate has
            incurred, or is reasonably expected to incur, any Withdrawal
            Liability to any Multiemployer Plan which, when aggregated with all

      substance reasonably satisfactory to the Senior Bank Facility Collateral
      Agent and as the Senior Bank Facility Collateral Agent deems necessary or

      benefit of the Senior Bank Facility Secured Parties over all of the Senior
      Bank Facility Collateral owned by such Senior Bank Facility Subsidiary
      Guarantor, and (ii) deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Senior Bank

      on the effective date of the Senior Bank Facility (with respect to the
      applicable Restricted Subsidiary) as shown on Schedule 6.03 to the Senior

      Collateral.

            (x) *Limitation on the Ability of Pipeline Company Borrowers to

      Facility Administrative Agent to the Borrower (or such shorter period as
      shall be specified by the Senior Bank Facility Administrative Agent and is
      reasonable under the circumstances); provided, however, that this Section
      6.02(l) shall only become effective from and after, and shall not cause a
      Default or an Event of Default under this Agreement prior to, the
      effectiveness of the Senior Bank Facility; or

            (m) *any default under any agreement or instrument relating to any
      secured obligation under the Senior Bank Facility, or any other event,
      shall occur and shall continue after the applicable grace period, if any,
      specified in such agreement or instrument, if the effect of such default
      or event is to accelerate the maturity of such secured obligation; or any
      such secured obligation shall be required to be prepaid (other than by a
      regularly scheduled required prepayment), prior to the stated maturity
      thereof, as a result of either (i) any default under any agreement or
      instrument relating to any such secured obligation, or (ii) the occurrence
      of any other event (other than an issuance, sale or other disposition of
      stock or other assets, or an incurrence or issuance of Indebtedness or
      other obligations, giving rise to a repayment or prepayment obligation in
      respect of such secured obligation) the effect of which would otherwise be
      to accelerate the maturity of such secured obligation if, as a result
      thereof or with respect thereto, the holder of (or the agent for the
      holders of) such secured obligation shall take any action not permitted by
      the Intercreditor Agreement to exercise any remedy with respect to the
      Senior Bank Facility Collateral or the Borrower shall agree to provide, or
      enter into any negotiation with a view to providing, any additional
      collateral, or any optional prepayment of such secured obligation, or any
      fee or other monetary consideration for any amendment, consent, waiver or
      other modification with respect to such payment default; provided,
      however, that this Section 6.02(m) shall only become effective from and
      after, and shall not cause a Default or an Event of Default under this
      Agreement prior to, the effectiveness of the Senior Bank Facility; or

            (n) any material provision of any Operative Document to which the
      Borrower, or any Subsidiary Loan Party is a party in whole or in material
      part shall for any reason cease to be the legal, valid and binding
      obligations of the Borrower or such Subsidiary Loan Party, as the case may
      be, or the validity of any such agreement shall be contested in writing by
      the Borrower or any such Subsidiary Loan Party, or the Borrower or any
      such Subsidiary Loan Party shall in writing deny liability under this
      Agreement, any Borrower Note or any such other Operative Document; or

            (o) the Agent shall at any time not have a valid and perfected first
      priority security interest in the Collateral (other than as a result of
      the action or inaction of the Agent or as a result of Permitted Liens); or

            (p) the Borrower fails, for any reason, to maintain its rightful
      ownership title to the Subsidiary Loans or the Subsidiary Borrower Notes,
      except as expressly permitted under the terms of any Operative Document
      (except as expressly contemplated under any Operative Document); or

            (q) the Borrower fails to beneficially own (directly or indirectly)
      100% of the voting equity interests in any Chain Subsidiary or Subsidiary
      Loan Party, except as otherwise provided in the Operative Documents; or

            (r) an Event of Default (as defined in the Subsidiary Borrower
      Credit Agreement) has occurred and is continuing after the expiration of
      any applicable grace periods;

then, and in any such event, the Agent shall at the request, or may with the
consent, of the Required Lenders, by notice to the Borrower, declare the Loan
and the Borrower Notes, all interest thereon and all other amounts payable under
this Agreement to be forthwith due and payable, whereupon the Loan and the
Borrower Notes, all such interest and all such amounts shall become and be
forthwith due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or further
notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by the Borrowers;
provided, however, that if an Event of Default under subsection (f) of this
Section 7.1 (except under clause (i)(A) thereof) shall occur, the Loan and the
Borrower Notes, all interest thereon and all other amounts payable under this
Agreement shall automatically become and be forthwith due and payable, without
presentment, demand, protest or any notice of any kind, all of which are hereby
expressly waived by the Borrower.

<PAGE>

      any or all of the Subsidiary Loans (including, without limitation, the

            (b) all promissory notes evidencing the Subsidiary Loans, the
      Subsidiary Borrower Credit Agreement, the Subsidiary Borrower Security
      Agreement, the Subsidiary Borrower Pledge Agreement, the mortgages and
      other instruments and agreements evidencing or securing the obligations

      (including, without limitation, the right (subject to Section 7.09(d)) to

      Notice);

            (c) the Collateral Account and all funds held therein and all
      certificates and instruments, if any, from time to time representing or
      evidencing the Collateral Account, and all interest, dividends, cash,
      instruments and other property from time to time received, receivable or
      otherwise distributed in respect of or in exchange for any or all funds
      from time to time in the Collateral Account;

            (d) all cash equivalents from time to time in the Collateral Account

            (e) all promissory notes issued to or held by the Borrower made by
      the Subsidiary Borrowers, including notes evidencing the Subsidiary Loans

      Subsidiary Borrowers not evidenced by any of such promissory notes; and

            (f) all proceeds of the foregoing.

      SECTION 7.02. Security for Obligations. This Agreement secures the payment
of all Obligations of the Borrower now or hereafter existing or incurred under,
arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, whether for principal,
interest, fees, expenses, indemnities or otherwise (all such obligations of the
Borrower being the "EPC SECURED OBLIGATIONS").

      SECTION 7.03. Delivery of Collateral. (a) All instruments and certificates
representing or evidencing the Collateral shall be delivered to and held by or
on behalf of the Collateral Agent on behalf of itself and the other Secured
Parties pursuant hereto and shall be in suitable form for transfer by delivery,
or shall be accompanied by duly executed instruments of transfer or assignment
in blank and undated, all in form and substance satisfactory to the Collateral
Agent. If the Borrower shall acquire (by purchase or otherwise) any additional
certificated Securities (or certificates or instruments representing such
Securities) issued by any Subsidiary Borrower at any time or from time to time
on or after the date the Loan is made, the Borrower will forthwith pledge and
deposit such Securities (or certificates or instruments representing such
Securities) as security with the Collateral Agent and deliver to the Collateral
Agent, and the Collateral Agent shall accept under this Agreement, certificates
or instruments


                                       57
<PAGE>

therefor, duly endorsed in blank by the Borrower or such other instruments of
transfer as are acceptable to the Collateral Agent, and promptly thereafter
deliver to the Collateral Agent a certificate executed by an authorized officer
of the Borrower describing such Securities and certifying that the same have
been duly pledged and delivered to the Collateral Agent.

            (b) The Collateral Agent shall have the right, at any time in its
      discretion after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of
      Default and without notice to the Borrower, to transfer to or to register
      in the name of the Collateral Agent or any of its nominees as pledged
      hereunder any or all of such Collateral, subject to the rights specified
      in Section 7.09. Promptly after any such transfer or registration, the
      Collateral Agent shall give notice thereof to the Borrower, but the
      failure to give such notice shall not affect any of the rights or remedies
      of the Collateral Agent hereunder. The Collateral Agent shall have the
      right at any time to exchange instruments or certificates representing or
      evidencing such Collateral for instruments or certificates of smaller or
      larger denominations, subject to the terms thereof.

      SECTION 7.04. Borrower Remains Liable. Anything herein to the contrary
notwithstanding, (a) the Borrower shall remain liable under the contracts and
agreements included in the Collateral to the extent set forth therein to perform
all of its duties and obligations thereunder to the same extent as if this
Agreement had not been executed, (b) the exercise by the Collateral Agent of any
of the rights hereunder shall not release the Borrower from any of its duties or
obligations under the contracts and agreements included in the Collateral, and
(c) neither the Collateral Agent nor the Agent nor any Lender shall have any
obligation or liability under the contracts and agreements included in the
Collateral by reason of this Agreement, nor shall any such Person be obligated
to perform any of the obligations or duties of the Borrower thereunder or to
take any action to collect or enforce any claim for payment assigned hereunder,
except as otherwise provided in Section 7.08 hereof.

      SECTION 7.05. Further Assurances. (a) The Borrower agrees that at any time
and from time to time, at the expense of the Borrower, the Borrower will
promptly execute and deliver, all further instruments and documents, and take
all further action that the Collateral Agent may reasonably request, in order to
perfect and protect any assignment and security interest granted or purported to
be granted hereby or to enable the Collateral Agent to exercise and enforce its
rights and remedies hereunder with respect to any Collateral. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, the Borrower will, upon the reasonable request
of the Collateral Agent, (i) execute and deliver to the Collateral Agent such
financing or continuation statements or amendments thereto, and such other
instruments or notices, as may be necessary or desirable, or as the Collateral
Agent may reasonably request, in order to perfect and preserve the security
interests granted or purported to be granted hereby and (ii) deliver to the
Collateral Agent promptly upon receipt thereof all instruments representing or
evidencing any of the Collateral duly endorsed and accompanied by duly executed
instruments of transfer or assignment, all in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Collateral Agent.

            (b) The Borrower hereby authorizes the Collateral Agent to file one
      or more financing or continuation statements, and amendments thereto,
      relating to all or any part of the Collateral without the signature of the
      Borrower where permitted by law. A photocopy or other reproduction of this
      Agreement or any financing statement covering the Collateral or any part
      thereof shall be sufficient as a financing statement where permitted by
      law.

            (c) The Borrower will not, without the prior written consent of the
      Collateral Agent (after having given the Collateral Agent not less than 30
      days' prior written notice thereof and after having executed and delivered
      to the Collateral Agent such further instruments and documents in
      connection therewith as may be requested by the Collateral Agent pursuant
      to this Section 7.05) change its name, move or transfer from the location
      specified in Section 9.02 hereof (or any subsequent location) its


                                       58
<PAGE>

      principal place of business or chief executive office, or the location of
      the Borrower's books and records with respect to the Collateral.

      SECTION 7.06. Collateral Agent Appointed Attorney-in-Fact. The Borrower
hereby irrevocably appoints the Collateral Agent the Borrower's
attorney-in-fact, with full authority in the place and stead of the Borrower and
in the name of the Borrower or otherwise, from time to time in the Collateral
Agent's discretion, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event
of Default, to take any action and to execute any instrument that the Collateral
Agent, in its reasonable judgment, may deem necessary or advisable to accomplish
the purposes of this Agreement, including, without limitation, to make demand on
the Borrower or any Affiliate of any thereof for all amounts due under each
Assigned Agreement to which it is a party, to receive, endorse and collect all
instruments made payable to the Borrower representing any payment or other
distribution in respect of the Collateral or any part thereof and to give full
discharge for the same, and to file any claims or take any action or institute
any proceedings that the Collateral Agent, in its reasonable judgment, may deem
necessary or desirable for the collection of any of the Collateral or otherwise
to enforce compliance with the terms and conditions of each Assigned Agreement
or the rights of the Collateral Agent with respect to any of the Collateral.

      SECTION 7.07. Collateral Agent May Perform. If the Borrower fails to
perform any agreement contained herein, the Collateral Agent may itself perform,
or cause the performance of, such agreement, and the expenses of the Collateral
Agent incurred in connection therewith shall be payable by the Borrower under
Section 9.04.

      SECTION 7.08. Reasonable Care. The powers conferred on the Collateral
Agent hereunder are solely to protect its interest in the Collateral and shall
not impose any duty upon it to exercise any such powers. The Collateral Agent
shall be deemed to have exercised reasonable care in the custody and
preservation of the Collateral in its possession if the Collateral is accorded
treatment substantially equal to that which an ordinary person accords its own
property, it being understood that none of the Collateral Agent or any Lender
shall have any responsibility for taking any necessary steps to preserve rights
against any parties with respect to any Collateral other than, with respect to
the Collateral Agent, (a) the safe custody of any Collateral in its possession,
(b) the filing of continuation statements on Form UCC-3 or UCC-4, as applicable,
in each jurisdiction, and with the filing offices, in which financing statements
on Form UCC-1 are filed as contemplated by Section 3.01(b)(ii) and Section
3.02(b)(ii), in each case within six months prior to the fifth anniversary of
the filing of any such Form UCC-1 statements, (c) the accounting for monies
actually received by it hereunder and (d) the application of monies in
accordance with this Agreement.

      SECTION 7.09. Rights, Remedies and Obligations. (a) The Borrower agrees,
and has irrevocably instructed each other party to each of the Assigned
Agreements to which it is a party, that all payments due or to become due to the
Borrower under or in connection with such Assigned Agreement shall be made
directly to the Collateral Account in accordance with Section 7.09(h) hereof.

            (b) All payments received by the Borrower under or in connection
      with the Assigned Agreements contrary to the provisions of this Agreement
      shall be received in trust for the benefit of the Collateral Agent on
      behalf of itself, the Lender and the Collateral Agent in accordance with
      their respective interests therein, shall be segregated from other funds
      of the Borrower, and shall forthwith be paid over to the Collateral Agent
      in the same form as so received (with any necessary endorsement).

            (c) The Borrower shall not be entitled to elect to receive any
      payment made pursuant to the Subsidiary Credit Agreement in assets other
      than cash, unless the Collateral Agent and each Lender have given their
      prior written consent, which consent shall be given in each such party's
      sole discretion. Unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Collateral
      Agent and each Lender, if the Borrower has not


                                       59
<PAGE>

      deposited sufficient funds into the Collateral Account to redeem any
      non-cash assets distributed or to be distributed pursuant to the
      Subsidiary Loan Agreement, on the second Business Day after any such
      liquidation distribution has been made, the Collateral Agent shall
      liquidate such non-cash assets promptly upon the receipt thereof.

            (d) The Collateral Agent shall have the exclusive right:

                  (i) to direct the disbursement or other disposition, pursuant
            to the terms hereof, of funds deposited to or otherwise held in the
            Collateral Account from time to time;

                  (ii) to deliver any notices, instructions or directions to the
            Collateral Agent that the Borrower is entitled to provide pursuant
            to the Subsidiary Loan Documents; and

                  (iii) to exercise and enforce any and all rights of the
            Borrower under the Subsidiary Loan Documents (subject to Section
            7.09(f) below).

            (e) The Borrower agrees that it will not, without the prior written
      consent of the Collateral Agent and the Required Lenders, file or join in
      the filing of a petition for the commencement of proceedings under the
      federal bankruptcy laws with respect to any Subsidiary Loan Party.

            (f) Until the Collection Date, and regardless of whether any Event
      of Default shall have occurred and notwithstanding the pledge hereunder by
      the Borrower of the Subsidiary Loans and its rights under the Subsidiary
      Credit Agreement and the other Subsidiary Loan Documents, and
      notwithstanding any other provision in any other Operative Document, the
      Collateral Agent shall be entitled, in its own right and without consent
      from the Borrower, to deliver a notice of the occurrence of an "Event of
      Default" under the Subsidiary Loan Documents (such notice, a "SUBSIDIARY
      DEFAULT NOTICE") pursuant to Section 7.02 of the Subsidiary Borrower
      Credit Agreement in the manner and with the effect provided therein;
      provided, however, that the Collateral Agent shall deliver such Subsidiary
      Default Notice upon the written instructions of the Required Lenders in
      accordance with Section 9.01 hereof; and provided further, however, that
      the Borrower shall have no right to rescind any such Subsidiary Default
      Notice without the prior written consent of the Collateral Agent and the
      Required Lenders and any notice of rescission delivered without such
      consent shall not be effective.

            (g) The Collateral Agent shall establish the Collateral Account with
      Citibank. The Collateral Account shall be in the name of the Collateral
      Agent and will be subject to the sole dominion and control of the
      Collateral Agent. The Collateral Account shall be subject to Applicable
      Laws, and applicable regulations of any competent banking or governmental
      authority, as may now or hereafter be in effect.

            (h) All amounts received by the Borrower with respect to the
      Collateral on any account whatsoever shall be deposited directly into the
      Collateral Account. On or prior to the Closing Date, the Borrower shall
      give to each Subsidiary Loan Party and the Subsidiary Collateral Agent
      written notice (such notice to be in form and substance satisfactory to
      the Collateral Agent) irrevocably instructing such Subsidiary Loan Party
      and the Subsidiary Collateral Agent, respectively, that all payments due
      to the Borrower under or in respect of the Subsidiary Credit Agreement or
      other Subsidiary Loan Documents and all other payments due to the Borrower
      under or in respect of the Subsidiary Loans shall be deposited directly
      into the Collateral Account.

            (i) The Collateral Agent shall apply all amounts deposited in the
      Collateral Account or otherwise received or realized from the Collateral
      to the payment of the Borrower's obligations in respect of the Loans as
      follows:


                                       60
<PAGE>

                  (i) First, to the Collateral Agent, an amount equal to the sum
            of the aggregate amount of costs, expenses and indemnified amounts
            hereunder that are then due and payable to the Collateral Agent for
            its own account;

                  (ii) Second, to the Agent, an amount equal to the sum of the
            aggregate amount of costs and expenses and indemnified amounts that
            are then due and payable to the Agent for its account;

                  (iii) Third, to the Agent for the ratable account, in
            accordance with their respective interests, of the Lenders, in each
            case to whom costs, expenses and indemnified amounts hereunder are
            then due and payable, an amount equal to the aggregate amount of
            such costs, expenses and indemnified amounts hereunder;

                  (iv) Fourth, to the Agent for the ratable account of the
            Lenders, an amount equal to the aggregate amount of accrued and
            unpaid interest and Facility Fee then due and payable;

                  (v) Fifth, to the Agent for the ratable account, in accordance
            with their respective interests, of the Lenders, as a repayment of
            the outstanding principal amount of the Loan, an amount equal to the
            lesser of (A) the balance of such funds and (B) the aggregate
            outstanding principal amount of the Advances; and

                  (vi) Sixth, on the Collection Date only, to the Borrower, the
            balance, if any, of such funds as directed by the Borrower.

      SECTION 7.10. Remedies upon Default. If any Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing:

            (a) The Collateral Agent may exercise in respect of the Collateral,
      in addition to other rights and remedies provided for herein or otherwise
      available to it, all of the rights and remedies of a secured party under
      the UCC in effect in the State of New York at that time (whether or not
      the New York UCC applies to the Collateral at issue) to the fullest extent
      permitted under applicable law, and the Collateral Agent may also, without
      notice except as specified below, sell the Collateral or any part thereof
      in one or more parcels at public or private sale, or at any of the
      Collateral Agent's offices or elsewhere, for cash, on credit or for future
      delivery, and upon such other terms as the Collateral Agent may deem
      commercially reasonable. The Borrower agrees that, to the extent notice of
      sale shall be required by law, at least ten days' notice to the Borrower
      of the time and place of any public sale or the time after which any
      private sale is to be made shall constitute reasonable notification. The
      Collateral Agent shall not be obligated to make any sale of Collateral or
      any part thereof regardless of notice of sale having been given. The
      Collateral Agent may adjourn any public or private sale from time to time
      by announcement at the time and place fixed therefor, and such sale may,
      without further notice, be made at the time and place to which it was so
      adjourned.

            (b) Any cash held by the Collateral Agent as Collateral and all cash
      proceeds received by the Collateral Agent in respect of any sale of,
      collection from, or other realization upon, all or any part of the
      Collateral shall be paid promptly after receipt thereof in whole or in
      part by the Collateral Agent pursuant to Section 7.09(i).

            (c) Subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, all rights of
      the Borrower to deliver any notices under or exercise any voting rights or
      other discretionary or consensual rights under any Assigned Agreement
      shall cease, and all such rights shall thereupon become vested in


                                       61
<PAGE>

      the Collateral Agent who shall thereupon have the sole right to exercise
      such voting and other consensual rights until such time as the EPC Secured
      Obligations have been paid in full. Notwithstanding the foregoing
      provisions, unless and until an Event of Default shall have occurred and
      be continuing, the Borrower may perform its obligations under the Assigned
      Agreements and may take any other actions in respect of such Assigned
      Agreements in any lawful manner not inconsistent with the provisions of
      this Agreement or any Assigned Agreement.

      SECTION 7.11. Continuing Assignment and Security Interest. This Agreement
shall create a continuing security interest in the Collateral and shall (a)
remain in full force and effect until the payment in full of the EPC Secured
Obligations on the Termination Date, (b) be binding upon the Borrower and its
successors and assigns, and (c) inure, together with the rights and remedies of
the Collateral Agent hereunder, to the benefit of the Collateral Agent, the
Agent and the Lender and their respective successors, transferees and assigns.
Upon the payment in full of the EPC Secured Obligations on the Collection Date,
the Borrower shall be entitled to the return, upon its request and at its
expense, of such of the Collateral as shall not have been sold or otherwise
applied pursuant to the terms hereof and the Collateral Agent will execute and
deliver such instruments, including UCC termination statements, as the Borrower
may reasonably request to confirm the release and discharge of the Lien
hereunder.

                                  Article VIII

                       THE AGENT AND THE COLLATERAL AGENT

      SECTION 8.01. Authorization and Action. (a) Each Lender hereby appoints
and authorizes CNAI, as the Agent and the Collateral Agent hereunder, to take
such action as Agent and Collateral Agent on its behalf and to exercise such
powers and discretion under this Agreement and the other Operative Documents as
are delegated to the Agent and the Collateral Agent by the terms hereof and
thereof, together with such powers and discretions as are reasonably incidental
thereto.

            (b) As to any matters not expressly provided for by the Loan
      Documents or the other Operative Documents, including enforcement or
      collection of the Debt resulting from the Loan and enforcement of this
      Agreement, the Agent and the Collateral Agent shall not be required to
      exercise any discretion or take any action, but shall be required to act
      or to refrain from acting (and shall be fully protected in so acting or
      refraining from acting) upon the instructions of the Required Lenders, and
      such instructions shall be binding upon the Agent and the Collateral
      Agent; provided, however, that the Agent or the Collateral Agent shall not
      be required to take any action that exposes it to personal liability or
      that is contrary to this Agreement or the other Operative Documents or
      applicable law.

            (c) The Agent agrees to give to each Lender prompt notice of each
      notice and copies of all other documents given to it by the Borrower and
      the Collateral Agent pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or the other
      Operative Documents, and agrees to give the Collateral Agent, if not the
      same Person as the Agent, prompt notice of each notice and copies of all
      other documents given to it by the Borrower or any Lender pursuant to the
      terms of this Agreement. The Collateral Agent, if not the same Person as
      the Agent, agrees to give to the Agent prompt notice of each notice and
      copies of all other documents given to it by the Borrower or any Lender
      pursuant to the terms hereof. The Collateral Agent agrees to deliver to
      each Lender prompt notice with respect to any notice to the Borrower
      regarding any Borrowing Base (as defined in the Subsidiary Borrower Credit
      Agreement) determination.

      SECTION 8.02. Agent's and Collateral Agent's Reliance, Etc. Neither the
Agent, the Collateral Agent or any of their respective directors, officers,
agents or employees shall be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken
by it or them under or in connection with the Loan Documents or the other
Operative Documents except for its or their own gross negligence, fraud or
willful misconduct, and each Lender agrees that it will not assert or seek to
assert any claim it might have against any of them in violation of this
provision. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing:

            (a) the Agent may treat the Lender that made an Advance as the
      holder of the Debt resulting therefrom until the Agent receives and
      accepts an Assignment and Acceptance entered into by such Lender, as
      assignor, and an Eligible Assignee, as assignee, as provided in Section
      9.07 hereof;

            (b) the Agent and the Collateral Agent may consult with legal
      counsel (including counsel for the Borrower), independent public
      accountants and other experts selected by them and shall not be liable for
      any action taken or omitted to be taken in good faith by it in accordance
      with the advice of such counsel, accountants or experts;

            (c) neither the Agent nor the Collateral Agent makes any warranty or
      representation to any Lender or shall be responsible to any Lender for any
      statements, warranties or representations made in or in connection with
      the Loan Documents or the other Operative Documents;

            (d) neither the Agent nor the Collateral Agent shall have any duty
      to ascertain or to inquire as to the performance or observance of any of
      the terms, covenants or conditions of any Loan Document or the other
      Operative Documents on the part of the Borrower or any Subsidiary Loan
      Party or to inspect the property (including the books and records) of the
      Borrower or any Subsidiary Loan Party;

            (e) neither the Agent nor the Collateral Agent shall be responsible
      to any Lender for the due execution, legality, validity, enforceability,
      genuineness, sufficiency or value of any Loan Document or the other
      Operative Documents or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant
      hereto or thereto;

            (f) neither the Agent nor the Collateral Agent shall be liable under
      or in respect of any Loan Document or the other Operative Documents by
      acting upon any notice, consent, certificate or other instrument or
      writing (which may be by telegram, telecopy, cable or telex) believed by
      it to be genuine and signed or sent by the proper party or parties;

            (g) neither the Agent nor the Collateral Agent makes any
      representation or warranty or shall have any responsibility concerning the
      value or validity of the Collateral or the validity or the perfection of
      the pledge thereof; and

            (h) the Agent may assume that no Default or Event of Default has
      occurred and is continuing unless it has, in its capacity as Agent
      hereunder, actual knowledge or actual notice to the contrary.

      SECTION 8.03. Lender Credit Decision. Each Lender acknowledges that it
has, independently and without reliance upon the Agent or the Collateral Agent
and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made
its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender
also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the


                                       63
<PAGE>

Agent or the Collateral Agent and based on such documents and information as it
shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in
taking or not taking action under this Agreement.

      SECTION 8.04. Indemnification of the Agents. Each Lender severally agrees
to indemnify each of the Agent, the Collateral Agent and any of their respective
directors, officers, agents or employees (each, an "AGENT-RELATED PERSON") (to
the extent not promptly reimbursed by the Borrower) from and against such
Lender's ratable share of any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages,
penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any
kind or nature whatsoever that may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted
against such Agent-Related Person in any way relating to or arising out of the
Operative Documents in connection with any action taken or omitted by such
Agent-Related Person under the Operative Documents (collectively, the
"INDEMNIFIED COSTS"); provided, however, that no Lender shall be liable for any
portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions,
judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from such
Agent-Related Person's gross negligence or willful misconduct as found in a
final, non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction. Without
limitation of the foregoing, each Lender agrees to reimburse each Agent-Related
Person promptly upon demand for its ratable share of any costs and expenses
(including, without limitation, fees and expenses of counsel) payable by the
Borrower under Section 9.04, to the extent that such Agent-Related Person is not
promptly reimbursed for such costs and expenses by the Borrower. In the case of
any investigation, litigation or proceeding giving rise to any Indemnified
Costs, this Section 8.04 applies whether any such investigation, litigation or
proceeding is brought by the Lender or any other Person.

      SECTION 8.05. Successor Agents. Each of the Agent and the Collateral Agent
(each for purposes only of this Section 8.05, an "AGENT") may resign at any time
(effective when such Agent shall be discharged, as provided below) by giving
written notice thereof to the Lenders and the Borrower. Upon any such
resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right to appoint a successor
Agent, which shall be a Qualified Successor Agent. If no successor Agent shall
have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such
appointment, within 30 days after the retiring Agent's giving of notice of
resignation, then the retiring Agent may, on behalf of the Required Lenders
appoint a successor Agent, which shall be a Qualified Successor Agent. Upon the
acceptance of any appointment as Agent hereunder by a successor Agent, and upon
the execution and filing or recording of such financing statements, or
amendments thereto, and such other instruments or notices, as may be necessary
or desirable, such successor Agent shall succeed to and become vested with all
the rights, powers, discretion, privileges and duties of the retiring Agent, and
the retiring Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations under the
Loan Documents and the other Operative Documents. After any retiring Agent's
resignation hereunder as Agent, the provisions of this Article VIII and the
other provisions of this Agreement applicable to the Agent shall be binding on
and inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it
while it was Agent under the Loan Documents and the other Operative Documents.

      SECTION 8.06. Lead Arrangers. Neither Lead Arranger shall have any
obligation to the Lenders under this Agreement.

                                   Article IX

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

      SECTION 9.01. Amendments, Etc. Subject to the other provisions of this
Agreement, no amendment, waiver, modification or supplement of any provision of
this Agreement or any other Loan Document, nor consent to any departure by the
Borrower therefrom, shall in any event be effective unless


                                       64
<PAGE>

the same shall be in writing and signed by the Borrower, the Agent and the
Required Lenders, and then such amendment, waiver, modification, supplement or
consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific
purpose for which given; provided, however, that without the prior written
consent of each Lender, no amendment waiver, modification, supplement or consent
(including, without limitation, any consent or waiver by the Collateral Agent
with respect to the Subsidiary Loan Documents) shall be effective that amends,
waives, modifies, supplements, or consents to any departure from, any provision
of this Agreement in any way which would:

            (a) reduce the amount of principal or interest that is payable on
      account of any Advance or portion thereof, or delay any scheduled date for
      payment thereof; or

            (b) reduce fees payable by the Borrower to the Agent which relate to
      payments to the Lenders or delay the dates on which such fees are payable;
      or

            (c) reduce any rights expressly granted to the Lenders to receive
      any other amounts payable under this Agreement, or delay any scheduled
      date for payment thereof; or

            (d) subject such Lender to any increased or additional Obligations
      hereunder or in connection herewith; or

            (e) amend or waive any provision contained in this Section 9.01 or
      in the proviso to Section 5.02(t);

            (f) release, modify or impair the pledge, assignment and security
      interests provided for in this Agreement;

            (g) amend the definition of Required Lenders;

            (h) subordinate any Lien of the Collateral Agent for the benefit of
      the Secured Parties or the Subsidiary Secured Parties as defined in the
      Subsidiary Borrower Credit Agreement to any other Lien;

            (i) consent to any assignment or transfer of the Borrower's or any
      Subsidiary Loan Parties' rights and obligations under any Loan Document or
      otherwise release the Borrower or any Subsidiary Loan Party from its
      obligations under any Loan Document; or

            (j) amend the provisions of Section 7.09(c).

      SECTION 9.02. Notices, Etc. All notices and other communications provided

            (g) as to each party, at such other address as shall be designated
      by such party in a written notice to the other parties. Any such notices
      and communications shall be deemed to be delivered, given, and received
      for all purposes as of the date so delivered, if delivered personally, or
      otherwise as of the date on which the same was received or when the
      appropriate answerback or other evidence of receipt is given, if
      telecopied or otherwise transmitted, respectively (if a Business Day or,
      if not, on the next succeeding Business Day).

      SECTION 9.03. No Waiver; Remedies. No failure on the part of the Borrower,
any Lender or the Agent or the Collateral Agent exercise, and no delay in
exercising, any right hereunder or under any Loan Document shall operate as a
waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
right. The remedies herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any
remedies provided by law.

      SECTION 9.04. Costs and Expenses. (a) The Borrower will reimburse all
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including, without limitation, expenses
incurred in connection with due diligence and fees and expenses of counsel) (i)
of the Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Co-Agents and the Lead Arrangers
incurred by them in connection with the preparation, syndication, execution,
administration (including, without limitation, all costs and expenses incurred
by the Collateral Agent in connection with establishing and maintaining the
Collateral Account), waiver and modification of the this Agreement and the other
Operative Documents and (ii) of the Agent and the Lenders incurred by them in
connection with the enforcement of this Agreement and the other Operative
Documents. The Borrower, upon presentation of a statement of account, shall
reimburse such amounts, whether or not the transactions contemplated herein are
consummated or the Operative Documents are executed and delivered.

            (b) The indemnities set forth in this Section 9.04 shall be in
      addition to any other obligations or liabilities of the Borrower hereunder
      or at common law or otherwise; provided, however, that the indemnities set
      forth in this Section 9.04 shall not apply with respect to Taxes and
      liabilities with respect thereto, for which the exclusive remedy of the
      Lender and the Agent and the Collateral Agent against the Borrower shall
      be pursuant to Section 2.09 hereof. Without prejudice to the survival of
      any other obligation of the Borrower under this Agreement, but subject to
      the foregoing, the indemnities and obligations contained in this Section
      9.04 shall survive the payment in full of the principal of and interest on
      the Loan or any other termination of this Agreement.

            (c) If any payment of principal of any LIBOR Advance is made by the
      Borrower to or for the account of any Lender other than on the last day of
      the Interest Period for such Advance, as a result of a payment pursuant to
      Section 2.06, acceleration of the maturity of the Borrower Notes pursuant
      to Section 6.01 or for any other reason, or if the Borrower fails to make
      any payment or prepayment of an Advance for which a notice of prepayment
      has been given or that is otherwise required to be made, whether pursuant
      to Section 2.04, 2.06 or 6.01 or otherwise, the Borrower shall, upon
      demand by the


                                       66
<PAGE>

      affected Lender (with a copy of such demand to the Agent), pay to the
      Agent for the account of the Lender any amounts required to compensate
      such Lender for any additional losses, costs or expenses that it may
      reasonably incur as a result of such payment or such failure to pay or
      prepay, as the case may be, including, without limitation, any loss
      (including loss of anticipated profits), cost or expense incurred by
      reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds
      acquired by the Lender to fund or maintain such Advance.

            (d) The Borrower agrees to indemnify, defend and save and hold
      harmless the Agent, each Lender and each of their Affiliates and their
      respective officers, directors, employees, agents and advisors (each, an
      "INDEMNIFIED PARTY") from and against, and shall pay within ten days after
      demand therefor, any and all claims, damages, losses, liabilities and
      expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable fees and expenses of
      counsel) that may be incurred by or asserted or awarded against any
      Indemnified Party, in each case arising out of or in connection with or by
      reason of (including, without limitation, in connection with any
      investigation, litigation or proceeding or preparation of a defense in
      connection therewith) (i) the Loan Facility, the actual or proposed use of
      the proceeds of the Advances, the Operative Documents or any of the
      transactions contemplated thereby, including, without limitation, any
      acquisition or proposed acquisition of all or any portion of the Equity
      Interests in or debt securities or substantially all of the assets of the
      Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or (ii) the actual or alleged presence
      of hazardous materials on any property of the Borrower or any Subsidiary
      Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries or any environmental action relating
      in any way to the Borrower or any Subsidiary Loan Party or any of its
      Subsidiaries], except to the extent such claim, damage, loss, liability or
      expense is found in a final, non-appealable judgment by a court of
      competent jurisdiction to have resulted from such Indemnified Party's
      gross negligence or willful misconduct. In the case of an investigation,
      litigation or other proceeding to which the indemnity in this Section
      9.04(d) applies, such indemnity shall be effective whether or not such
      investigation, litigation or proceeding is brought by the Borrower or any
      Subsidiary Loan Party, its directors, shareholders or creditors or an
      Indemnified Party, whether or not any Indemnified Party is otherwise a
      party thereto and whether or not the transactions contemplated hereunder
      or under the other Operative Documents are consummated. The Borrower also
      agrees not to assert any claim against the Agent, any Lender or any of
      their Affiliates, or any of their respective officers, directors,
      employees, agents and advisors, on any theory of liability, for special,
      indirect, consequential or punitive damages arising out of or otherwise
      relating to the Loan Facility, the actual or proposed use of the proceeds
      of the Advances, the Operative Documents or any of the transactions
      contemplated by the Operative Documents.

      SECTION 9.05. Right of Set-off. Upon (a) the occurrence and during the
continuance of any Event of Default and (b) the making of the request or the
granting of the consent specified by Section 6.01 hereof to authorize the Agent
to declare the Loan due and payable pursuant to the provisions of Section 6.01
hereof, each Lender is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to
the fullest extent permitted by law, to set-off and otherwise apply any and all
deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time
held and other indebtedness at any time owing by such Lender to or for the
credit or the account of the Borrower (other than any deposits held in the
Collateral Account, which deposits the parties to this Agreement acknowledge are
specifically excluded from the Lender's set-off rights provided for in this
Section 9.05) against any and all of the Obligations of the Borrower now or
hereafter existing under this Agreement and although such obligations may be
unmatured. Each Lender agrees promptly to notify the Borrower after any such
set-off and application; provided, however, that the failure to give such notice
shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application. The rights of
each Lender under this Section 9.05 are in addition to other rights and remedies
(including, without limitation, other rights of set-off) that such Lender may
have.

      SECTION 9.06. Binding Effect. This Agreement shall become effective when
it shall have been executed by the Borrower, the Agent, the Lead Arrangers, the
Co-Agents and the Collateral


                                       67
<PAGE>

Agent and when the Agent shall have been notified by the Initial Lenders that
the Initial Lenders have executed it and thereafter shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the Borrower, the Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Lead
Arrangers, the Co-Agents and the Lenders and their respective successors and
assigns; provided, however, that the obligations of the Lenders under Article II
hereof shall not become effective until satisfaction by the Borrower or waiver
by each Lender of each of the conditions set forth in Section 3.01 hereof; and
provided further that the Borrower shall not have the right to assign its rights
or obligations hereunder or any interest herein without the prior written
consent of the affected Lender.

      SECTION 9.07. Assignments and Participations. (a) Each Lender may assign
to one or more banks or other financial institutions all or a portion of its
rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of the
Advances owing to it and the Borrower Notes, if any, held by it); provided,
however, that (i) each such assignment shall be of a constant, and not a
varying, percentage of all such Lender's rights and obligations under this
Agreement, (ii) the amount of the Commitment or Advances (as the case may be) of
the assigning Lender being assigned to an assignee pursuant to each such
assignment (determined as of the date of the Assignment and Acceptance with
respect to such assignment) shall in no event (except in the case of an
assignment to an existing Lender) be less than $1,000,000 (or, if less, the
entire Commitment or Advances (as the case may be) of the assigning Lender) and
shall be an integral multiple of $1,000,000, (iii) each such assignment shall be
to an Eligible Assignee, and (iv) the parties to each such assignment shall
execute and deliver to the Agent, for its acceptance and recording in the
Register, an Assignment and Acceptance, together with any Borrower Notes subject
to such assignment and a processing and recordation fee of $3,500, and shall
send to the Borrower an executed counterpart of such Assignment and Acceptance.
Upon such execution, delivery, acceptance and recording, from and after the
effective date specified in each Assignment and Acceptance, (A) the assignee
thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent that rights and
obligations hereunder have been assigned to it pursuant to such Assignment and
Acceptance, have the rights and obligations of a Lender hereunder and (B) the
assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent that rights and obligations
hereunder have been assigned by it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance,
relinquish its rights and be released from its obligations under this Agreement
(and, in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering all or the remaining
portion of an assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement,
such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto).

            (b) By executing and delivering an Assignment and Acceptance, each
      Lender assignor thereunder and the assignee thereunder confirm to and
      agree with each other and the other parties hereto as follows: (i) other
      than as provided in such Assignment and Acceptance, such assigning Lender
      makes no representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with
      respect to any statements, warranties or representations made in or in
      connection with this Agreement or the execution, legality, validity,
      enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of this Agreement or any
      other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto; (ii) such
      assigning Lender makes no representation or warranty and assumes no
      responsibility with respect to the financial condition of the Borrower or
      any Subsidiary Loan Party or the performance or observance by any thereof
      of any of its obligations under this Agreement or any other instrument or
      document furnished pursuant hereto; (iii) such assignee confirms that it
      has received a copy of this Agreement, together with copies of the most
      recent financial statements delivered pursuant to Section 5.01 or 5.03 and
      such other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate to make
      its own credit analysis and decision to enter into such Assignment and
      Acceptance; (iv) such assignee will, independently and without reliance
      upon the Agent, such assigning Lender or any other Lender and based on
      such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time,
      continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action
      under this Agreement; (v) such assignee confirms that it is (subject to
      any approval required in the definition of "Eligible Assignee") an
      Eligible Assignee; (vi) such assignee appoints and authorizes the Agent to
      take such action as agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers under
      this Agreement as are delegated to the Agent by the terms hereof, together
      with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto; and (vii) such
      assignee agrees that it will


                                       68
<PAGE>

      perform in accordance with their terms all of the obligations which by the
      terms of this Agreement are required to be performed by it as a Lender.

            (c) The Agent shall maintain at its address referred to in Section
      9.02 a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to and accepted by
      it and a register (which register may be in electronic form) for the
      recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders and the Commitment
      of, and principal amount of the Advances owing to, each Lender from time
      to time (the "REGISTER"). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive
      and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the
      Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the
      Register as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement. The
      Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower at any
      reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. Upon
      the acceptance of any Assignment and Acceptance for recordation in the
      Register, and if any assignee under this Section 9.07 shall not be a
      Lender at the time of the assignment, it also shall deliver to the Agent
      such administrative details as the Agent may reasonably require.

            (d) Upon its receipt of an Assignment and Acceptance executed by an
      assigning Lender and an assignee representing that it is an Eligible
      Assignee, together with any Borrower Notes subject to such assignment, the
      Agent shall, if such Assignment and Acceptance has been completed and is
      in substantially the form of Exhibit A hereto, (i) accept such Assignment
      and Acceptance, (ii) record the information contained therein in the
      Register and (iii) give prompt notice thereof to the Borrower. Within five
      Business Days after its receipt of such notice and its receipt of an
      executed counterpart of such Assignment and Acceptance, the Borrower, at
      its own expense, shall execute and deliver to the Agent in exchange for
      the surrendered Borrower Notes, if any, and to the extent requested, new
      Borrower Notes to the order of such Eligible Assignee (or its nominee) in
      an amount equal to the amount of loans acquired pursuant to such
      Assignment and Acceptance and, if the assigning Lender has retained a loan
      hereunder, new Borrower Notes, if requested, payable to the order of the
      assigning Lender in an amount equal to the loan retained by it hereunder.
      Such new Borrower Notes, if any, shall be in an aggregate principal amount
      equal to the aggregate principal amount of such surrendered Borrower
      Notes, if any, shall be dated the Closing Date and shall otherwise be in
      substantially the form of Exhibit A.

            (e) Each Lender may sell participations to one or more banks or
      other entities in or to all or a portion of its rights and obligations
      under this Agreement (including all or a portion of the Advances owing to
      it and any Borrower Notes held by it); provided, however, that (i) such
      Lender's obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii)
      such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto
      for the performance of such obligations, (iii) such Lender shall remain
      the holder of any such Borrower Notes for all purposes of this Agreement,
      (iv) the Borrower, the Agent and the other Lenders shall continue to deal
      solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's
      rights and obligations under this Agreement, (v) such Lender shall
      continue to be able to agree to any modification or amendment of this
      Agreement or any waiver hereunder without the consent, approval or vote of
      any such participant or group of participants, other than modifications,
      amendments and waivers which (A) postpone any date fixed for any payment
      of, or reduce any payment of, principal of or interest on such Lender's
      advances or Borrower Notes or any facility fees payable under this
      Agreement, or (B) reduce the interest rate payable under this Agreement
      and such Lender's Borrower Notes, or (C) consent to the assignment or the
      transfer by the Borrower of any of its rights and obligations under the
      Agreement, and (vi) except as contemplated by the immediately preceding
      clause (v), no participant shall be deemed to be or to have any of the
      rights or obligations of a "Lender" hereunder.

            (f) Any Lender may, in connection with any assignment or
      participation or proposed assignment or participation pursuant to this
      Section 9.07, disclose to the assignee or participant or proposed assignee
      or participant, any information relating to the Borrower furnished to such
      Lender by or on behalf of the Borrower.

            (g) Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, any
      Lender may at any time create a security interest in all or any portion of
      its rights under this Agreement (including the Advances owing to it) and
      the Borrower Notes issued to it hereunder in favor of any Federal Reserve
      Bank in accordance with Regulation A of the Board of Governors of the
      Federal Reserve System (or any successor regulation) and the applicable
      operating circular of such Federal Reserve Bank. Any Lender which is a
      fund may also create such a security interest in favor of any holders of
      obligations owed or securities issued by such Lender or to any trustee for
      or other representatives of such holders. No consent of either the Agent
      or the Borrower shall be necessary with respect to such security interest.

      SECTION 9.08. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York.

      SECTION 9.09. Execution in Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in
any number of counterparts and by different parties hereto in separate
counterparts, each of which when so executed shall be deemed to be an original
and all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.
Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by
telecopier shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of
this Agreement.

      SECTION 9.10. Consent to Jurisdiction. (a) The Borrower, on behalf of
itself and its successors and assigns and in respect of its property, hereby
irrevocably agrees, to the fullest extent it may do so under law, in the event
it files any action, one effect of which could be to halt, enjoin, impair or
hinder the enforcement of the parties' obligations hereunder or under the other
Loan Documents, or proceedings to enforce collection on those obligations,
including, but not limited to, any proceeding under the United States Bankruptcy
Code, to file such action, and hereby irrevocably agrees that all claims in
respect of such action or proceeding may be heard and determined, in the United
States District Court for the Southern District of New York sitting in New York
City or in such District's Bankruptcy Court, as applicable, assuming venue in
that District would be proper, or in the courts of the State of New York, First
Department sitting in New York County. The Borrower, on behalf of itself and its
successors and assigns, hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent it may
do so under law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to such action or
proceeding. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Borrower, on
behalf of itself and its successors and assigns, hereby irrevocably agrees to
elect in favor of filing in or transferring to the United States District Court
for the Southern District of New York, assuming that venue in such district
would otherwise be proper, to the extent it has any control over the choice of a
district for the filing or transfer of a case under the United States Bankruptcy
Code for any of its Affiliates as debtor. In the event an Affiliate of the
Borrower or any of its Affiliates is the subject of a separate case under the
United States Bankruptcy Code, in a court other than the Bankruptcy Court for
the Southern District of New York, the Borrower, on behalf of itself and its
successors and assigns, hereby irrevocably agrees to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law to seek a transfer to the latter district, assuming
venue in such district would otherwise be proper. In the event that a bankruptcy
court enters a motion to consolidate multiple cases filed by the Borrower or any
of its Affiliates, the Borrower also agrees to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law to seek a transfer of the consolidated case to the latter
district, assuming venue in such district would otherwise be proper. The
execution of this Agreement is expressly conditioned on the willingness and
intention of the Borrower to enforce the provisions of this Section 9.10. In
addition, the Borrower warrants that it is subject to no preexisting obligations
that would interfere with its adherence to the foregoing provisions of this
Section 9.10 and additionally warrants that it will not enter into other
agreements that in any way compromise its ability to adhere to these provisions
without the express written consent of the Lender.

            (b) Any legal action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement or
      any other Loan Document may be brought in the courts of the State of New
      York located in the County of New York or of the United States for the
      Southern District of New York, and, by execution and delivery of this


                                       70
<PAGE>

      Agreement, the Borrower hereby irrevocably accepts for itself and in
      respect of its property, generally and unconditionally, the jurisdiction
      of the aforesaid courts. Nothing herein shall affect the right of the
      Agent, the Collateral Agent or the Lender to bring any legal action or
      proceeding with respect to this Agreement or any other Loan Document
      against the Borrower in the courts of any other jurisdiction. To the
      fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Borrower hereby
      irrevocably waives any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the
      laying of venue of any of the aforesaid actions or proceedings arising out
      of or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document brought
      in the courts referred to in subsection (a) of this Section 9.10 and
      hereby further irrevocably waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any
      such court that any such action or proceeding brought in any such court
      has been brought in an inconvenient forum.

            (c) The Borrower hereby irrevocably appoints CT Corporation System
      with offices on the date hereof at 111 Eighth Avenue, 13th Floor, New
      York, NY 10011 (or any successor, provided that such successor shall be
      located in New York City and engaged in the business of acting as a
      process agent and shall be a company of national recognition, and provided
      further that notice of such successor agent shall be promptly given to the
      Collateral Agent and the Agent by the Borrower, the "PROCESS AGENT") as
      its designee, appointee and agent to receive, accept and acknowledge on
      its behalf and its property service of copies of the summons and complaint
      and any other process that may be served in any action or proceeding under
      subsection (a) or (b) of this Section 9.10. Such service may be made by
      delivering a copy of such process to the Borrower in care of the Process
      Agent at the Process Agent's address and the Borrower hereby authorizes
      and directs the Process Agent to accept such service on its behalf. As an
      alternative method of service, the Borrower also irrevocably consents to
      the service of any and all process in any such action or proceeding by the
      delivering of copies of such process to the Borrower at its address
      specified in Section 9.02 hereof. To the fullest extent permitted by
      applicable law, the Borrower agrees that a non-appealable final judgment
      in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced
      in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
      provided by law.

      SECTION 9.11. Loan Facility Migration. To facilitate the placement of the
Take-Out Securities, the Co-Agents understand that the Borrower intends to cause
the proposed amendment and restatement of the Senior Bank Facility to provide
that (a) the obligations of the Borrower under the Loan Facility may be assigned
to and assumed by EPPH, another Chain Subsidiary or a newly-created entity held
by a Chain Subsidiary, in each case as approved by the Co-Agents (such assignee
referred to herein as the "ASSIGNEE"); (b) the interest of the Borrower in the
Collateral may be assigned contemporaneously to the Assignee (subject to the
liens and security interests arising under the Loan Facility); and (c) the
Borrower may guarantee the obligations of the Assignee under the Loan Facility
that are assumed by the Assignee. At the mutual agreement of the Borrower and
the Co-Agents, at any time after giving effect to such amendment and restatement
of the Senior Bank Loan Facility (if such amendments occur), the Borrower (x)
shall assign to the Assignee, and shall cause the Assignee to assume, all of the
obligations of the Borrower under the Loan Facility; (y) shall assign to the
Assignee all of the Borrower's interest in the Collateral; and (z) shall
guarantee the obligations of the Assignee under the Loan Facility. Following
such assignment and assumption, the Assignee shall surrender to the Subsidiary
Borrowers the notes evidencing the Subsidiary Loans in exchange for new notes
payable to the order of the Assignee.

      SECTION 9.12. Waiver of Jury Trial. The Borrower, the Agent, the
Collateral Agent and the Lender each hereby irrevocably waives all right to
trial by jury in any action, proceeding or counterclaim (whether based on
contract, tort or otherwise) arising out of or relating to any of the Loan
Documents, the Loan or the actions of the Agent, the Collateral Agent or the
Lender in the negotiation, administration, performance or enforcement thereof.


                                       71

      SECTION 9.13. Most Favored Nation Treatment. Each Lender and each Lead
Arranger shall have the benefit of "most favored nation" treatment with respect
to the Senior Bank Facility and the Refinancing of the Electron Transaction
(collectively, the "MFN Transactions"), whether such MFN Transactions close
prior to or after the Closing Date. Each Co-Agent, on behalf of the Lenders,
shall have the individual right (exercised by written notice to the Borrower) to
cause the Operative Documents to be amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise
modified to reflect the terms and conditions of the MFN Transactions in their
sole discretion. The foregoing shall not apply to pricing terms after the
completion of the successful syndication of the Loan Facility (defined as may be
separately agreed among the Borrower and the Lead Arrangers). "Most-favored
nation" treatment shall not require the Lenders to accept any term or condition
of any MFN Transaction, including, without limitation, any term or condition
that is less favorable to the Lenders than those that exist on the Closing Date.
This Section 9.13 shall not apply to any conforming changes to be made to the
provisions of this Agreement as contemplated under Section 9.15.

      SECTION 9.14. Termination. Upon payment in full of all of the Obligations
of the Borrower under this Agreement on the Termination Date, (a) this Agreement
shall terminate (other than obligations under this Agreement which are expressly
stated to survive such termination) and (b) the Collateral and the Subsidiary
Collateral shall be released from the Liens created by the Loan Documents and
the other Operative Documents, and all Obligations (other than those expressly
stated to survive such termination) of the Borrower and the Subsidiary Loan
Parties under the Loan Documents and the other Operative Documents shall
terminate, in each case without delivery of any instrument or performance of any
act by any Person. In addition, the Agent shall, from time to time after the
Termination Date and at the sole expense of the Borrower, deliver such
statements of termination as the Borrower may reasonably request to evidence the
termination of this Agreement and the other Operative Documents and the release
of the Liens created hereby and thereby.

      SECTION 9.15. Conformity with Senior Bank Facility. The Borrower and each
Lender hereby agree to enter into, execute and deliver and, if requested by the
Borrower, each of the Co-Agents and the Agent hereby acknowledges and agrees
that it will enter into, execute and deliver or acknowledge and accept, as the
case may be, an amendment to this Agreement to conform each defined term,
Section, subsection, clause, and other provision hereof identified with an
asterisk to the respective defined term, Section, subsection, clause and other
provision contained in the execution version of Senior Bank Facility, such
amendment to be entered into, executed and delivered no later than ten Business
Days after the making of the initial loan under the Senior Bank Facility. Each
such Person acknowledges and agrees to be bound as of the Closing Date by any
such defined term, Section, subsection, clause and other provision, identified
with an asterisk, in each case as so amended. If the Senior Bank Facility is not
consummated, then the provisions of this Agreement (including, without
limitation, those marked with an asterisk (*)) shall remain unchanged. During
the period between the effectiveness of the Senior Bank Facility and the
effectiveness of the amendment referred to above, any event or circumstance
which would not constitute a Default or an Event of Default hereunder if such
amendment were effective during such period, shall not constitute a Default or
an Event of Default hereunder during such period prior to the effectiveness of
such amendment.
