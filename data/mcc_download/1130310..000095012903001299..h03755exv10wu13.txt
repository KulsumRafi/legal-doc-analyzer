                           which it relates; provided, however, that, with

         The foregoing to the contrary notwithstanding, for any Plan Year in
         which Transition Benefit Compensation exceeds the compensation
         limitation under Code Section 401(a)(17), Transition Benefit
         Compensation for such year shall be deemed equal to the applicable
         compensation limitation under the Code. For purposes of Plan Years
         commencing after December 31, 2000, the Code Section 401(a)(17)
         limitation for 2001, $170,000, shall be applied in determining whether
         Transition Benefit Compensation for any such year exceeds the Code
         Section 401(a)(17) limitation for such year.

                  (d)      Crediting and Vesting of Transition Benefit to Cash
         Balance Account: The balance of a BTB Eligible Member's Cash Balance
         Account as of the later of March 1, 2001, or the date he becomes a
         Resources Group Employee during the Transfer Period (with such later
         date hereinafter the "Adjustment Date") shall be adjusted, to the
         extent necessary, as of such date to be equal to the greater of (1) the
         balance of the Member's Cash Balance Account as of the Adjustment Date
         or (2) the Actuarial Equivalent present value of the Member's
         Grandfathered Benefit, as described in Section 7.6, calculated assuming
         that the Member terminated Service on the Adjustment Date.

                  An eligible Member's Transition Benefit shall be equal to the
         sum of his (1) if any, Base Transition Benefit Amount and (2) if any,
         Additional Transition Benefit Amount, subject to the applicable
         limitations under Article XXI of the Plan and otherwise under the Code,
         ERISA and other applicable law and regulations. The Transition Benefit,
         if applicable, as adjusted in the foregoing paragraph, shall be
         credited to an eligible Member's Cash Balance Account as of or as soon
         as practicable after the later of (1) March 1, 2001, or (2) the date
         such Member becomes eligible for such benefit(s). Notwithstanding any
         provision in this Plan to the contrary, a Member shall be fully vested
         in the portion of his Cash Balance Account attributable to his
         Transition Benefit at all times on and after the date such amount is
         credited to such account.

                  (e)      Earliest Commencement of Transition Benefit from Cash
         Balance Account: Notwithstanding Section 11.1 or any other provision in
         this Plan to the contrary, a Member who has terminated his Service (or,
         in the event of his death, his Beneficiary) may not elect to commence
         the distribution of the portion of his Pension attributable to the
         Transition Benefit prior to the earliest of (1) the Distribution Date,
         (2) his Early Retirement Date, (3) his date of death or (4) such other
         date determined by the Board of Directors of the Company. The foregoing
         shall not prevent the application of Section 11.6 when otherwise
         applicable with respect to a Member's Pension.

                  (f)      Amendment to Transition Benefit: The Company reserves
         the right to amend this Section 7.8 as necessary to comply with
         requirements of the Code, ERISA, the Internal Revenue Service and/or
         the U.S. Department of Labor."

                  11.      Effective as of March 1, 2001, Article VIII of the
Plan is hereby amended to add the following new Section 8.4:

                  "8.4     Transition Benefit: Anything to the contrary
         notwithstanding, to the extent Section 8.1, 8.2 or 8.3 conflicts with
         the provisions of Section 7.8 with respect to the commencement of the
         portion of a Member's Pension, if any, that is attributable to the
         Transition Benefit under such Section 7.8, then solely with respect to
         the Transition Benefit, the provisions of Section 7.8 shall apply in
         lieu of the applicable of Section 8.1, 8.2 or 8.3."

                  12.      Effective as of January 1, 2001, Article VIII of the
Plan is hereby amended to add the following new Section 8.5:

                  "8.5     Involuntary Separation Benefit For Members Severed
         Between January 1, 2001 and December 31, 2001: A Member (i) whose
         Service is terminated involuntarily on or after January 1, 2001 and on
         or before March 1, 2001 in the case of a Resources Group Employee, or
         on or before December 31, 2001 with respect to all other Members, (ii)
         who has attained age 45, but not age 55, and completed at least five
         (5) years of Service on the date of such involuntary termination, and
         (iii) who qualifies for a benefit under a Company-sponsored involuntary
         severance benefit plan which provides for this benefit, and who
         satisfies all requirements for such benefit under such severance plan,
         may be entitled to receive an Early Retirement benefit, as described in
         Section 8.2, (x) in the case of a NorAm Member or Minnegasco Member,
         based on his Service accrued for benefit accrual purposes as of his
         actual termination of Service but not payable until the NorAm Member or
         Minnegasco Member has attained at least age 55 or (y) in the case of a
         Prior Plan Member, based on his Service accrued for benefit accrual
         purposes as of his actual termination of Service plus such Service
         which would have accrued for purposes of eligibility for the Early
         Retirement benefit but not for purposes of benefit accrual had the
         Member remained actively employed with an Employer until attaining age
         55 but not payable until the Prior Plan Member has attained at least
         age 55. The Actuarial Equivalent present value of the benefit
         (including the early retirement subsidy) shall be calculated under the
         terms of the Prior Plan, the Minnegasco Plan or the NorAm Plan, as
         applicable, based on Compensation (as defined in such applicable plan)
         and Service until termination. For purposes of this Section 8.5,
         "Actuarial Equivalent" shall be computed using the Unisex Mortality
         Table UP-1984 without any age adjustments and an interest rate of 8.5%
         per annum."

                  IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Reliant Energy, Incorporated has caused
these presents to be executed by its duly authorized duly authorized officer in
a number of copies, all of which shall constitute one and the same instrument,
which may be sufficiently evidenced by any executed copy hereof, this 20th day
of August, 2002, but effective as of the dates specified herein.
