<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Dear Mr.&nbsp;Murrell:</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are employed by First Financial Bancorp (&#147;FFBC&#148;) in a key executive
position. Continuity of the management of FFBC and its affiliate banks is a
critical factor in the continued success of FFBC. The Board of Directors of
FFBC believes it is in the best interest of FFBC to encourage the continued
effort and dedication of key members of management to their assigned duties.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In consideration of the mutual promises contained in this letter, FFBC
shall provide to you, and you shall receive from FFBC, the benefits set forth
in this letter (&#147;Agreement&#148;), if your employment with FFBC is terminated during
the term of this Agreement.

your employment with FFBC, and special arrangements and dispute
resolution proceedings relating to the termination of your employment for
any reason other than: (i)&nbsp;your retirement; (ii)&nbsp;your becoming totally
and permanently disabled under the FFBC long-term disability plan or
policy; or (iii)&nbsp;your death. This Agreement supersedes all prior
agreements with FFBC and any of its affiliate banks or any predecessor
businesses, except the Confidentiality Agreement concurrently entered, or
previously entered, between you and FFBC, and the special severance
benefits provided under this Agreement are to be provided instead of any
other severance arrangements offered by FFBC. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, neither your termination of employment nor anything contained
in this Agreement shall have any adverse effect upon your rights under
any tax-qualified &#147;pension benefit plan,&#148; as such term is defined in the
Employee</FONT></TD>

Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. &#167; I, <I>et seq</I>. (&#147;FAA&#148;). If the FAA is held not

enforceable under the laws of the state in which you are employed. Both
parties consent that judgment upon the arbitration award may be entered
in any federal or state court that has jurisdiction. The acceptance of
any benefit under this Agreement shall be deemed ratification of this
agreement to arbitrate claims. In the event you breach this Agreement by
filing a lawsuit, at the time your lawsuit is filed, you will return any
