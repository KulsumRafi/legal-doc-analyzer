</FONT><FONT FACE="Times,Times New Roman" SIZE=2><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">THIS LOAN AND SECURITY AGREEMENT</B> is entered into on the above date between SILICON VALLEY BANK ("Silicon"), whose address is 3003 Tasman Drive, Santa Clara, California 95054 and the borrower<STRIKE>(s)</STRIKE> named above (<STRIKE>jointly --and severally,</STRIKE> the "Borrower"), whose chief executive office is located at the above address ("Borrower's Address"). The Schedule to this Agreement (the "Schedule") shall for all purposes be deemed to be a part of this Agreement, and the same is an integral part of this Agreement. (Definitions of certain terms used in this Agreement are set forth in Section 8 below.)</P>
<B><I><P>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#9;LOANS.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.1 Loans. </B></I>Silicon will make loans to Borrower (the "Loans"), in amounts determined by Silicon in its good faith business judgment, up to the amounts (the "Credit Limit") shown on the Schedule, provided no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, and subject to deduction of Reserves for accrued interest and such other Reserves as Silicon deems proper from time to time in its good faith business judgment<B>*</B>.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">* in accordance with the provisions set forth in the definition of the term "Reserves" below in Section 8</P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.2 Interest.</B></I> All Loans and all other monetary Obligations shall bear interest at the rate shown on the Schedule, except where expressly set forth to the contrary in this Agreement. Interest shall be payable monthly, on the last day of the month. Interest may, in Silicon's discretion, be charged to Borrower's loan account, and the same shall thereafter bear interest at the same rate as the other Loans. Silicon may, in its discretion, charge interest to Borrower's Deposit Accounts maintained with Silicon. <STRIKE>Regardless of the amount of Obligations that may be outstanding from time to time, Borrower shall pay Silicon minimum monthly interest during the term of this Agreement in the amount set forth on the Schedule (the "Minimum Monthly Interest").</P>
</STRIKE><B><I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.3 Overadvances. </B></I>If at any time or for any reason the total of all outstanding Loans and all other monetary Obligations exceeds the Credit Limit (an "Overadvance"), Borrower shall immediately pay the amount of the excess to Silicon, without notice or demand. Without limiting Borrower's obligation to repay to Silicon the amount of any Overadvance, Borrower agrees to pay Silicon interest on the outstanding amount of any Overadvance, on demand, at the Default Rate.</P>
<B><I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.4 Fees.</B></I> Borrower shall pay Silicon the fees shown on the Schedule, which are in addition to all interest and other sums payable to Silicon and are not refundable.</P>
<B><I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.5 Loan Requests.</B></I> To obtain a Loan, Borrower shall make a request to Silicon by facsimile or telephone. Loan requests received after 12:00 Noon will not be considered by Silicon until the next Business Day. Silicon may rely on any telephone request for a Loan given by a person whom Silicon believes is an authorized representative of Borrower, and Borrower will indemnify Silicon for any loss Silicon suffers as a result of that reliance.</P>
<B><I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.6 Letters of Credit.</B></I> At the request of Borrower, Silicon may, in its good faith business judgment, issue or arrange for the issuance of letters of credit for the account of Borrower, in each case in form and substance satisfactory to Silicon in its sole discretion (collectively, "Letters of Credit"). The aggregate face amount of all Letters of Credit from time to time outstanding shall not exceed the amount shown on the Schedule (the "Letter of Credit Sublimit"), and shall be reserved against Loans which would otherwise be available hereunder, and in the event at any time there are insufficient Loans available to Borrower for such reserve, Borrower shall deposit and maintain with Silicon cash collateral in an amount at all times equal to such deficiency, which shall be held as Collateral for all purposes of this Agreement. Borrower shall pay all bank charges (including charges of Silicon) for the issuance of Letters of Credit, together with such additional fee as Silicon's letter of credit department shall charge in connection with the issuance of the Letters of Credit. Any payment by Silicon under or in connection with a Letter of Credit shall constitute a Loan hereunder on the date such payment is made. Each Letter of Credit shall have an expiry date no later than thirty days prior to the Maturity Date. Borrower hereby agrees to indemnify and hold Silicon harmless from any loss, cost, expense, or liability, including payments made by Silicon, expenses, and reasonable attorneys' fees incurred by Silicon arising out of or in connection with any Letters of Credit. Borrower agrees to be bound by the regulations and interpretations of the issuer of any Letters of Credit guarantied by Silicon and opened for Borrower's account or by Silicon's interpretations of any Letter of Credit issued by Silicon for Borrower's account, and Borrower understands and agrees that Silicon shall not be liable for any error, negligence, or mistake, whether of omission or commission, in following Borrower's instructions or those contained in the Letters of Credit or any modifications, amendments, or supplements thereto. Borrower understands that Letters of Credit may require Silicon to indemnify the issuing bank for certain costs or liabilities arising out of claims by Borrower against such issuing bank. Borrower hereby agrees to indemnify and hold Silicon harmless with respect to any loss, cost, expense, or liability incurred by Silicon under any Letter of Credit as a result of Silicon's indemnification of any such issuing bank. The provisions of this Loan Agreement, as it pertains to Letters of Credit, and any other Loan Documents relating to Letters of Credit are cumulative.</P>
<B><I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SECURITY INTEREST. </B></I>To secure the payment and performance of all of the Obligations when due, Borrower hereby grants to Silicon a security interest in all of the following (collectively, the "Collateral"): all right, title and interest of Borrower in and to all of the following, whether now owned or hereafter arising or acquired and wherever located: all Accounts; all Inventory; all Equipment; all Deposit Accounts; all General Intangibles (including without limitation all Intellectual Property); all Investment Property; all Other Property; and any and all claims, rights and interests in any of the above, and all guaranties and security for any of the above, and all substitutions and replacements for, additions, accessions, attachments, accessories, and improvements to, and proceeds (including proceeds of any insurance policies, proceeds of proceeds and claims against third parties) of, any and all of the above, and all Borrower's books relating to any and all of the above<B>*</B>.</P>

The Collateral now is and will remain free and clear of any and all liens, charges, security interests, encumbrances and adverse claims, except for Permitted Liens.

Such notification to Silicon shall constitute a grant of a security interest in the commercial tort claim and all proceeds thereof to Silicon, and Borrower shall execute and deliver all such documents and take all such actions as Silicon shall request in connection therewith.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(d) &#9;<STRIKE>None of the Collateral now is or will be affixed to any real property in such a manner, or with such intent, as to become a fixture.</STRIKE> Borrower is not and will not become a lessee under any real property lease pursuant to which the lessor may obtain any rights in any of the Collateral and no such lease now prohibits, restrains, impairs or will prohibit, restrain or impair Borrower's right to remove any Collateral from the leased premises. Whenever any Collateral is located upon premises in which any third party has an interest, Borrower shall, whenever requested by Silicon, use its best efforts to cause such third party to execute and deliver to Silicon, in form acceptable to Silicon, such waivers and subordinations as Silicon shall specify in its good faith business judgment. Borrower will keep in full force and effect, and will comply with all material terms of, any lease of real property where any of the Collateral now or in the future may be located.</P>

Borrower may, however, defer payment of any contested taxes, provided that Borrower (i) in good faith contests Borrower's obligation to pay the taxes by appropriate proceedings promptly and diligently instituted and conducted, (ii) notifies Silicon in writing of the commencement of, and any material development in, the proceedings, and (iii) posts bonds or takes any other steps required to keep the contested taxes from becoming a lien upon any of the Collateral.

Borrower has paid, and shall continue to pay all amounts necessary to fund all present and future pension, profit sharing and deferred compensation plans in accordance with their terms, and Borrower has not and will not withdraw from participation in, permit partial or complete termination of, or permit the occurrence of any other event with respect to, any such plan which could reasonably be expected to result in any liability of Borrower, including any liability to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation or its successors or any other governmental agency. </P>

All such insurance policies shall name Silicon as an additional loss payee, and shall contain a lenders loss payee endorsement in form reasonably acceptable to Silicon. Upon receipt of the proceeds of any such insurance, Silicon shall apply such proceeds in reduction of the Obligations as Silicon shall determine in its good faith business judgment, except that, provided no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, Silicon shall release to Borrower insurance proceeds with respect to Equipment totaling less than $100,000, which shall be utilized by Borrower for the replacement of the Equipment with respect to which the insurance proceeds were paid.

Silicon may directly or through any affiliated company purchase or lease any Collateral at any such public disposition, and if permissible under applicable law, at any private disposition.

Any surplus shall be paid to Borrower or other persons legally entitled thereto; Borrower shall remain liable to Silicon for any deficiency. If, Silicon, in its good faith business judgment, directly or indirectly enters into a deferred payment or other credit transaction with any purchaser at any sale of Collateral, Silicon shall have the option, exercisable at any time, in its good faith business judgment, of either reducing the Obligations by the principal amount of purchase price or deferring the reduction of the Obligations until the actual receipt by Silicon of the cash therefor.</P>
<B><I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">7.6 Remedies Cumulative.</B></I> In addition to the rights and remedies set forth in this Agreement, Silicon shall have all the other rights and remedies accorded a secured party under the California Uniform Commercial Code and under all other applicable laws, and under any other instrument or agreement now or in the future entered into between Silicon and Borrower, and all of such rights and remedies are cumulative and none is exclusive.

The failure or delay of Silicon to exercise any rights or remedies shall not operate as a waiver thereof, but all rights and remedies shall continue in full force and effect until all of the Obligations have been fully paid and performed.</P>

<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">* For purposes of computing availability of Loans, checks, wire transfers and other items of payment received by Silicon (including proceeds of Accounts) shall be deemed applied by Silicon on account of the Obligations on the date received by Silicon in immediately available funds, provided that funds received after 12:00 Noon on any day shall be deemed received on the next Business Day.</P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">9.2 Application of Payments. </B></I>All payments with respect to the Obligations may be applied, and in Silicon's good faith business judgment reversed and re-applied, to the Obligations, in such order and manner as Silicon shall determine in its good faith business judgment.</P>
<B><I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">9.3 Charges to Accounts. </B></I>Silicon may, in its discretion, require that Borrower pay monetary Obligations in cash to Silicon, or charge them to Borrower's Loan account, in which event they will bear interest at the same rate applicable to the Loans. Silicon may also, in its discretion, charge any monetary Obligations to Borrower's Deposit Accounts maintained with Silicon.</P>
<B><I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">9.4 Monthly Accountings.</B></I> Silicon shall provide Borrower monthly with an account of advances, charges, expenses and payments made pursuant to this Agreement. Such account shall be deemed correct, accurate and binding on Borrower and an account stated (except for reverses and reapplications of payments made and corrections of errors discovered by Silicon), unless Borrower notifies Silicon in writing to the contrary within 60 days after such account is rendered, describing the nature of any alleged errors or omissions.</P>

<B><I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">9.7 Integration.</B></I> This Agreement and such other written agreements, documents and instruments as may be executed in connection herewith are the final, entire and complete agreement between Borrower and Silicon and supersede all prior and contemporaneous negotiations and oral representations and agreements, all of which are merged and integrated in this Agreement. <U>There are no oral understandings, representations or agreements between the parties which are not set forth in this Agreement or in other written agreements signed by the parties in connection herewith.</P>
</U><B><I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">9.8 Waivers; Indemnity.</B></I> The failure of Silicon at any time or times to require Borrower to strictly comply with any of the provisions of this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall not waive or diminish any right of Silicon later to demand and receive strict compliance therewith. Any waiver of any default shall not waive or affect any other default, whether prior or subsequent, and whether or not similar. None of the provisions of this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be deemed to have been waived by any act or knowledge of Silicon or its agents or employees, but only by a specific written waiver signed by an authorized officer of Silicon and delivered to Borrower. Borrower waives the benefit of all statutes of limitations relating to any of the Obligations or this Agreement or any other Loan Document, and Borrower waives demand, protest, notice of protest and notice of default or dishonor, notice of payment and nonpayment, release, compromise, settlement, extension or renewal of any commercial paper, instrument, account, General Intangible, document or guaranty at any time held by Silicon on which Borrower is or may in any way be liable, and notice of any action taken by Silicon, unless expressly required by this Agreement. Borrower hereby agrees to indemnify Silicon and its affiliates, subsidiaries, parent, directors, officers, employees, agents, and attorneys, and to hold them harmless from and against any and all claims, debts, liabilities, demands, obligations, actions, causes of action, penalties, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees), of every kind, which they may sustain or incur based upon or arising out of any of the Obligations, or any relationship or agreement between Silicon and Borrower, or any other matter, relating to Borrower or the Obligations; provided that this indemnity shall not extend to damages proximately caused by the indemnitee's own gross negligence or willful misconduct. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, the indemnity agreement set forth in this Section shall survive any termination of this Agreement and shall for all purposes continue in full force and effect.</P>
<B><I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">9.9 No Liability for Ordinary Negligence.</B></I> Neither Silicon, nor any of its directors, officers, employees, agents, attorneys or any other Person affiliated with or representing Silicon shall be liable for any claims, demands, losses or damages, of any kind whatsoever, made, claimed, incurred or suffered by Borrower or any other party through the ordinary negligence of Silicon, or any of its directors, officers, employees, agents, attorneys or any other Person affiliated with or representing Silicon, but nothing herein shall relieve Silicon from liability for its own gross negligence or willful misconduct.</P>
<B><I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">9.10 Amendment.</B></I> The terms and provisions of this Agreement may not be waived or amended, except in a writing executed by Borrower and a duly authorized officer of Silicon.</P>
<B><I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">9.11 Time of Essence.</B></I> Time is of the essence in the performance by Borrower of each and every obligation under this Agreement.</P>
<B><I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">9.12 Attorneys Fees and Costs.</B></I> Borrower shall reimburse Silicon for all reasonable attorneys' fees and all filing, recording, search, title insurance, appraisal, audit, and other reasonable costs incurred by Silicon, pursuant to, or in connection with, or relating to this Agreement (whether or not a lawsuit is filed), including, but not limited to, any reasonable attorneys' fees and costs Silicon incurs in order to do the following: prepare and negotiate this Agreement and all present and future documents relating to this Agreement; obtain legal advice in connection with this Agreement or Borrower; enforce, or seek to enforce, any of its rights; prosecute actions against, or defend actions by, Account Debtors; commence, intervene in, or defend any action or proceeding; initiate any complaint to be relieved of the automatic stay in bankruptcy; file or prosecute any probate claim, bankruptcy claim, third-party claim, or other claim; examine, audit, copy, and inspect any of the Collateral or any of Borrower's books and records; protect, obtain possession of, lease, dispose of, or otherwise enforce Silicon's security interest in, the Collateral; and otherwise represent Silicon in any litigation relating to Borrower. In satisfying Borrower's obligation hereunder to reimburse Silicon for attorneys fees, Borrower may, for convenience, issue checks directly to Silicon's attorneys, Levy, Small &amp; Lallas, but Borrower acknowledges and agrees that Levy, Small &amp; Lallas is representing only Silicon and not Borrower in connection with this Agreement. If either Silicon or Borrower files any lawsuit against the other predicated on a breach of this Agreement, the prevailing party in such action shall be entitled to recover its reasonable costs and attorneys' fees, including (but not limited to) reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred in the enforcement of, execution upon or defense of any order, decree, award or judgment. All attorneys' fees and costs to which Silicon may be entitled pursuant to this Paragraph shall immediately become part of Borrower's Obligations, shall be due on demand, and shall bear interest at a rate equal to the highest interest rate applicable to any of the Obligations.</P>
<B><I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">9.13 Benefit of Agreement.</B></I> The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the respective successors, assigns, heirs, beneficiaries and representatives of Borrower and Silicon; provided, however, that Borrower may not assign or transfer any of its rights under this Agreement without the prior written consent of Silicon, and any prohibited assignment shall be void. No consent by Silicon to any assignment shall release Borrower from its liability for the Obligations.</P>
<B><I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">9.14 Joint and Several Liability.</B></I> If Borrower consists of more than one Person, their liability shall be joint and several, and the compromise of any claim with, or the release of, any Borrower shall not constitute a compromise with, or a release of, any other Borrower.</P>
<B><I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">9.15 Limitation of Actions.</B> </I>Any claim or cause of action by Borrower against Silicon, its directors, officers, employees, agents, accountants or attorneys, based upon, arising from, or relating to this Loan Agreement, or any other Loan Document, or any other transaction contemplated hereby or thereby or relating hereto or thereto, or any other matter, cause or thing whatsoever, occurred, done, omitted or suffered to be done by Silicon, its directors, officers, employees, agents, accountants or attorneys, shall be barred unless asserted by Borrower by the commencement of an action or proceeding in a court of competent jurisdiction by the filing of a complaint within <B>* </B><STRIKE>one year</STRIKE> after the first act, occurrence or omission upon which such claim or cause of action, or any part thereof, is based, and the service of a summons and complaint on an officer of Silicon, or on any other person authorized to accept service on behalf of Silicon, within thirty (30) days thereafter. Borrower agrees that such <B>** </B><STRIKE>one-year</STRIKE> period is a reasonable and sufficient time for Borrower to investigate and act upon any such claim or cause of action. The<B>** </B><STRIKE>one-year</STRIKE> period provided herein shall not be waived, tolled, or extended except by the written consent of Silicon in its sole discretion. This provision shall survive any termination of this Loan Agreement or any other Loan Document.</P>

<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">9.16 Paragraph Headings; Construction.</B></I> Paragraph headings are only used in this Agreement for convenience. Borrower and Silicon acknowledge that the headings may not describe completely the subject matter of the applicable paragraph, and the headings shall not be used in any manner to construe, limit, define or interpret any term or provision of this Agreement. This Agreement has been fully reviewed and negotiated between the parties and no uncertainty or ambiguity in any term or provision of this Agreement shall be construed strictly against Silicon or Borrower under any rule of construction or otherwise.</P>
<B><I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">9.17 Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Venue.</B></I> This Agreement and all acts and transactions hereunder and all rights and obligations of Silicon and Borrower shall be governed by the laws of the State of California.
