obligations under the Related Documents unless otherwise expressly provided herein or therein, (iii) the payment obligations of the parties under the Related Documents shall not be discharged by an
amount paid in a currency or in a place other than that specified with respect to such obligations, whether pursuant to a judgment or otherwise, except to the extent actually received by the Person
entitled thereto and converted into Dollars by such Person (it being understood and agreed that, if any transaction party shall so receive an amount in a currency other than Dollars, it shall (A) if
it is not the Person entitled to receive payment, promptly return the same (in the currency in which received) to the Person from whom it was received or (B) if it is the Person entitled to receive
payment, either, in its sole discretion, (x) promptly return the same (in the currency in which received) to the Person from whom it was received or (y) subject to reasonable commercial practices,
promptly cause the conversion of the same into Dollars), (iv) to the extent that the amount so paid on prompt conversion to Dollars under normal commercial practices does not yield the requisite
amount of Dollars, the obligee of such payment shall have a separate cause of action against the party obligated to make the relevant payment for the additional amount necessary to yield the amount
due and owing under the Related Documents, (v) if, for the purpose of obtaining a judgment in any court with respect to any obligation under any of the Related Documents, it shall be necessary to
convert to any other currency any amount in Dollars due thereunder and a change shall occur between the rate of exchange applied in making such conversion and the rate of exchange prevailing on the
date of payment of such judgment, the obligor in respect of such obligation will pay such additional amounts (if any) as may be necessary to insure that the amount paid on the date of payment is the
amount in such other currency which, when converted into Dollars and transferred to New York City, New York, in accordance with normal banking procedures, will result in realization of the amount then
due in Dollars and (vi) any amount due under this paragraph shall be due as a separate debt and shall not be affected by or merged into any judgment being obtained for any other sum due under or in
respect of any Related Document. In no event, however, shall the respective judgment debtor be required to pay a larger amount in such other currency, at the rate of exchange in effect on the date of
payment than the amount of Dollars stated to be due under the respective Related Document, so that in any event the obligations of the respective judgment debtor under the Related Document will be
effectively maintained as Dollar obligations. </FONT></P>
