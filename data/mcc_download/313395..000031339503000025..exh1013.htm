<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As part of a Borrowing Base redetermination, the Lender may include as part of the Borrowing Base an automatic reduction schedule, monthly or quarterly, in an amount determined by the Lender in its sole discretion, but based upon the Lender's customary standards and practices from time to time in effect with respect to secured oil and gas property lines of credit.  Such automatic reductions, each in the amounts so determined and so scheduled (each a "Periodic Reduction"), shall cause an automatic reduction to the Borrowing Base on the dates set in the schedule so determined by the Lender.  Each reduction to the Borrowing Base by a Periodic Reduction shall be permanent, subject to any increase agreed to as part of a subsequent Borrowing Base redetermination.  As part of the notification by the Lender to the Borrower of the result of a Borrowing Base redetermination, the Lender shall notify the Borrower of the terms and schedule of any Periodic Reductions included therein.  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of Subsection 2.4(b), the Borrower shall pay the amount of any Loan Excess that results from the application of each Periodic Reduction to the Borrowing Base on the day that such Periodic Reduction takes effect.  The Borrowers specifically acknowledges that the thirty (30) day grace period set forth in Subsection 2.4(b) pertaining to a Loan Excess resulting from a Borrowing Base redetermination is not applicable to any failure to make such mandatory prepayment triggered by a Loan Excess due to a Periodic Reduction as provided in this Subsection 2.4(c).</TD>

For the avoidance of doubt, the Borrower and the Lender agree that as of the time of this Amendment, the Amount has been increased to thirteen million ($13,000,000.00) dollars (having been previously increased from the Amount on the Closing Date of $5,000,000.00 to $10,000,000.00 previously).  Furthermore, as of the time of this Amendment, the Borrowing Base has been increased to thirteen million ($13,000,000.00) dollars.  As part of that increase to and redetermination of the Borrowing Base, the Borrower acknowledges and agrees that the Lender has established Periodic Reductions to the Borrowing Base in the amounts of $1,000,000.00 on December 31, 2002, and $1,000,000.00 on March 31, 2003.</TD>
