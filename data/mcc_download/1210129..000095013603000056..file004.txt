                                                                  EXECUTION COPY

                      UBS MORTGAGE LOAN PURCHASE AGREEMENT

                  Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement, dated as of December 18,
2002 (the "Agreement"), between UBS Warburg Real Estate Investments Inc.
(together with its successors and permitted assigns hereunder, the "Seller"),
UBS Principal Finance LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, as an
additional party responsible for the Seller's obligations hereunder (in such
capacity, together with its successors and permitted assigns hereunder, the
"Additional Party"), and Structured Asset Securities Corporation II (together
with its successors and permitted assigns hereunder, the "Purchaser").

                  The Seller intends to sell and the Purchaser intends to
purchase certain multifamily and commercial mortgage loans (the "Mortgage
Loans") as provided herein. The Purchaser intends to deposit the Mortgage Loans,
together with certain other multifamily and commercial mortgage loans (the
"Other Loans"; and, together with the Mortgage Loans, the "Securitized Loans"),
into a trust fund (the "Trust Fund"), the beneficial ownership of which will be
evidenced by multiple classes (each, a "Class") of mortgage pass-through
certificates (the "Certificates") to be identified as the LB-UBS Commercial
Mortgage Trust 2002-C7, Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series
2002-C7. One or more "real estate mortgage investment conduit" ("REMIC")
elections will be made with respect to the Trust Fund. The Certificates will be
issued pursuant to a Pooling and Servicing Agreement (the "Pooling and Servicing
Agreement"), to be dated as of December 11, 2002, between the Purchaser, as
depositor, Wachovia Bank, National Association, as master servicer (the "Master
Servicer"), Lennar Partners, Inc., as special servicer (the "Special Servicer"),
LaSalle Bank National Association, as trustee (the "Trustee"), and ABN AMRO Bank
N.V., as fiscal agent (the "Fiscal Agent"). Capitalized terms used but not
defined herein have the respective meanings set forth in the Pooling and
Servicing Agreement, as in effect on the Closing Date.

                  The Purchaser has entered into an Underwriting Agreement (the
"Underwriting Agreement"), dated as of the date hereof, with Lehman Brothers
Inc. ("Lehman") and UBS Warburg LLC ("UBSW" and, together with Lehman, the
"Underwriters"), whereby the Purchaser will sell to the Underwriters all of the
Certificates that are to be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the "Securities Act"). The Purchaser has also entered into a
Certificate Purchase Agreement (the "Certificate Purchase Agreement"), dated as
of the date hereof, with Lehman and UBSW (together in such capacity, the
"Placement Agents"), whereby the Purchaser will sell to the Placement Agents all
of the remaining Certificates (other than the Residual Interest Certificates).

                  In connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, the
Seller, UBS (USA), Inc. (the "Co-Indemnitor"), the Purchaser, the Underwriters
and the Placement Agents have entered into an Indemnification Agreement (the
"Indemnification Agreement"), dated as of the date hereof.

                  Now, therefore, in consideration of the premises and the
mutual agreements set forth herein, the parties agree as follows:

                  SECTION 1. Agreement to Purchase. The Seller agrees to sell,
and the Purchaser agrees to purchase, the Mortgage Loans identified on the
schedule (the "Mortgage Loan Schedule") annexed hereto as Exhibit A. The
Mortgage Loan Schedule may be amended to reflect the actual Mortgage Loans
accepted by the Purchaser pursuant to the terms hereof. The Mortgage Loans will
have
<PAGE>

an aggregate principal balance of $664,532,137 (the "Initial UBS Pool Balance")
as of the close of business on December 11, 2002 (the "Cut-off Date"), after
giving effect to any and all payments of principal due thereon on or before such
date, whether or not received. The purchase and sale of the Mortgage Loans shall
take place on December 27, 2002 or such other date as shall be mutually
acceptable to the parties hereto (the "Closing Date"). The consideration for the
Mortgage Loans shall consist of: (A) a cash amount equal to a percentage
(mutually agreed upon by the parties hereto) of the Initial UBS Pool Balance,
plus interest accrued on each Mortgage Loan at the related Net Mortgage Rate,
for the period from and including the Cut-off Date up to but not including the
Closing Date, which cash amount shall be paid to the Seller or its designee by
wire transfer in immediately available funds (or by such other method as shall
be mutually acceptable to the parties hereto) on the Closing Date; and (B)
Certificates representing a 57.29% Percentage Interest in each of the Class R-I,
Class R-II, Class R-III and a 41.18% Percentage Interest in the Class R-LR
Certificates (all such Residual Interest Certificates, the "Seller's Residual
Interest Certificates").

               SECTION 2. Conveyance of Mortgage Loans.

               (a) Effective as of the Closing Date, subject only to receipt of
the purchase price referred to in Section 1 hereof and satisfaction or waiver of
the conditions to closing set forth in Section 5 hereof, the Seller does hereby
sell, transfer, assign, set over and otherwise convey to the Purchaser, without
recourse, all the right, title and interest of the Seller in and to the Mortgage
Loans identified on the Mortgage Loan Schedule as of such date (other than the
primary servicing rights and the right to receive the Retained Assumption Fee).
The Mortgage Loan Schedule, as it may be amended, shall conform to the
requirements set forth in this Agreement and the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement.

               (b) The Purchaser or its assignee shall be entitled to receive
all scheduled payments of principal and interest due after the Cut-off Date, and
all other recoveries of principal and interest collected after the Cut-off Date
(other than in respect of principal and interest on the Mortgage Loans due on or
before the Cut-off Date). All scheduled payments of principal and interest due
on or before the Cut-off Date for each Mortgage Loan, but collected after such
date, shall belong to, and be promptly remitted to, the Seller.

               (c) On or before the Closing Date, the Seller shall, on behalf of
the initial Purchaser, deliver to and deposit with the Trustee a Mortgage File
for each Mortgage Loan in accordance with the terms of, and conforming to the
requirements set forth in, the Pooling and Servicing Agreement. Concurrently
with such delivery, the Seller shall deliver copies of the Mortgage Note,
Mortgage(s) and any reserve and cash management agreements with respect to each
Mortgage Loan to the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer.

               (d) The Seller shall, through an Independent third party (the
"Recording/Filing Agent") retained by it, as and in the manner provided in the
Pooling and Servicing Agreement (and in any event within 45 days following the
later of the Closing Date and the date on which all necessary recording or
filing, as applicable, information is available to the Recording/Filing Agent),
cause (i) each assignment of Mortgage, each assignment of Assignment of Leases
and each assignment of UCC Financing Statement, in favor of, and delivered as
part of the related Mortgage File to, the Trustee, to be submitted for
recordation or filing, as the case may be, in the appropriate public office for
real property records or Uniform Commercial Code financing statements, as
appropriate, and (ii) such assignments to be delivered to the Trustee following
their return by the applicable public recording or filing office, as



                                      -2-
<PAGE>

the case may be, with copies of such returned assignments to be delivered by the
Trustee to the Master Servicer on a monthly basis; provided that, in those
instances where the public recording office retains the original assignment of
Mortgage or assignment of Assignment of Leases, a certified copy of the recorded
original shall be forwarded to the Trustee. If any such document or instrument
is lost or returned unrecorded or unfiled, as the case may be, because of a
defect therein, then the Seller shall prepare a substitute therefor or cure such
defect or cause such to be done, as the case may be, and the Seller shall
deliver such substitute or corrected document or instrument to the Trustee (or,
if the Mortgage Loan is then no longer subject to the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement, to the then holder of such Mortgage Loan).

               The Seller shall bear the out-of-pocket costs and expenses of all
such recording, filing and delivery contemplated in the preceding paragraph,
including, without limitation, any costs and expenses that may be incurred by
the Trustee in connection with any such recording, filing or delivery performed
by the Trustee at the Seller's request and the fees of the Recording/Filing
Agent.

               (e) All such other relevant documents and records that (a) relate
to the administration or servicing of the Mortgage Loans, (b) are not required
to be part of the Mortgage File, (c) are reasonably necessary for the ongoing
administration and/or servicing of such Mortgage Loan by the Master Servicer in
connection with its duties under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, and (d)
are in the possession or under the control of the Seller, together with all
unapplied Escrow Payments and Reserve Funds in the possession or under the
control of the Seller that relate to the Mortgage Loans and a statement
indicating which Escrow Payments and Reserve Funds are allocable to each
Mortgage Loan, shall be delivered or caused to be delivered by the Seller to the
Master Servicer (or, at the direction of the Master Servicer, to the appropriate
sub-servicer); provided that the Seller shall not be required to deliver any
draft documents, privileged or other communications, credit underwriting or due
diligence analyses, credit committee briefs or memoranda or other internal
approval documents or data or internal worksheets, memoranda, communications or
evaluations.

               (f) After the Seller's transfer of the Mortgage Loans to the
Purchaser, as provided herein, the Seller shall not take any action inconsistent
with the Purchaser's ownership of the Mortgage Loans. Except for actions that
are the express responsibility of another party hereunder or under the Pooling
and Servicing Agreement, and further except for actions that the Seller is
expressly permitted to complete subsequent to the Closing Date, the Seller
shall, on or before the Closing Date, take all actions required under applicable
law to effectuate the transfer of the Mortgage Loans by the Seller to the
Purchaser.

               (g) The Seller shall provide the Master Servicer the initial data
with respect to each Mortgage Loan for the CMSA Financial File and the CMSA Loan
Periodic Update File that are required to be prepared by the Master Servicer
pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.

               (h) The Seller has retained the right to receive the Retained
Assumption Fee. In connection therewith, the Seller acknowledges and consents to
the servicing and administration of the Harcourt Complex Mortgage Loan,
including, without limitation, in respect of the Retained Assumption Fee, as
provided in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.

               SECTION 3. Representations, Warranties and Covenants of Seller
and Additional Party.

               (a) Each of the Seller and the Additional Party (each, for
purposes of this Section 3(a), a "Representing Party") hereby represent and
warrant to and covenant with the Purchaser, as of the date hereof, that:

                    (i) The Representing Party is duly organized or formed, as
     the case may be, validly existing and in good standing as a legal entity
     under the laws of the State of Delaware and possesses all requisite
     authority, power, licenses, permits and franchises to carry on its business
     as currently conducted by it and to execute, deliver and comply with its
     obligations under the terms of this Agreement.

                    (ii) This Agreement has been duly and validly authorized,
     executed and delivered by the Representing Party and, assuming due
     authorization, execution and delivery hereof by the Purchaser, constitutes
     a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Representing Party,
     enforceable against the Representing Party in accordance with its terms,
     except as such enforcement may be limited by (A) bankruptcy, insolvency,
     reorganization, receivership, moratorium or other similar laws affecting
     the enforcement of creditors' rights in general, and (B) general equity
     principles (regardless of whether such enforcement is considered in a
     proceeding in equity or at law).

                    (iii) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
     Representing Party and the Representing Party's performance and compliance
     with the terms of this Agreement will not (A) violate the Representing
     Party's organizational documents, (B) violate any law or regulation or any
     administrative decree or order to which the Seller is subject or (C)
     constitute a default (or an event which, with notice or lapse of time, or
     both, would constitute a default) under, or result in the breach of, any
     material contract, agreement or other instrument to which the Representing
     Party is a party or by which the Representing Party is bound.

                    (iv) The Representing Party is not in default with respect
     to any order or decree of any court or any order, regulation or demand of
     any federal, state, municipal or other governmental agency or body, which
     default might have consequences that would, in the Representing Party's
     reasonable and good faith judgment, materially and adversely affect the
     condition (financial or other) or operations of the Representing Party or
     its properties or have consequences that would materially and adversely
     affect its performance hereunder.

                    (v) The Representing Party is not a party to or bound by any
     agreement or instrument or subject to any organizational document or any
     other corporate or limited liability company (as applicable) restriction or
     any judgment, order, writ, injunction, decree, law or regulation that
     would, in the Representing Party's reasonable and good faith judgment,
     materially and adversely affect the ability of the Representing Party to
     perform its obligations under this Agreement or that requires the consent
     of any third person to the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
     Representing Party or the performance by the Representing Party of its
     obligations under this Agreement.

                    (vi) Except for the recordation and/or filing of assignments
     and other transfer documents with respect to the Mortgage Loans, as
     contemplated by Section 2(d), no consent,

                                      -4-
<PAGE>

     approval, authorization or order of, registration or filing with, or notice
     to, any court or governmental agency or body, is required for the
     execution, delivery and performance by the Representing Party of or
     compliance by the Representing Party with this Agreement or the
     consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and no
     bulk sale law applies to such transactions.

                    (vii) No litigation is pending or, to the best of the
     Representing Party's knowledge, threatened against the Representing Party
     that would, in the Representing Party's good faith and reasonable judgment,
     prohibit its entering into this Agreement or materially and adversely
     affect the performance by the Representing Party of its obligations under
     this Agreement.

                    (viii) No proceedings looking toward merger, liquidation,
     dissolution or bankruptcy of the Representing Party are pending or
     contemplated.

               In addition, the Seller hereby further represents and warrants
to, and covenants with, the Purchaser, as of the date hereof, that:

                    (i) Under generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP")
     and for federal income tax purposes, the Seller will report the transfer of
     the Mortgage Loans to the Purchaser, as provided herein, as a sale of the
     Mortgage Loans to the Purchaser in exchange for the consideration specified
     in Section 1 hereof. In connection with the foregoing, the Seller shall
     cause all of its records to reflect such transfer as a sale (as opposed to
     a secured loan). The consideration received by the Seller upon the sale of
     the Mortgage Loans to the Purchaser will constitute at least reasonably
     equivalent value and fair consideration for the Mortgage Loans. The Seller
     will be solvent at all relevant times prior to, and will not be rendered
     insolvent by, the sale of the Mortgage Loans to the Purchaser. The Seller
     is not selling the Mortgage Loans to the Purchaser with any intent to
     hinder, delay or defraud any of the creditors of the Seller. After giving
     effect to its transfer of the Mortgage Loans to the Purchaser, as provided
     herein, the value of the Seller's assets, either taken at their present
     fair saleable value or at fair valuation, will exceed the amount of the
     Seller's debts and obligations, including contingent and unliquidated debts
     and obligations of the Seller, and the Seller will not be left with
     unreasonably small assets or capital with which to engage in and conduct
     its business. The Mortgage Loans do not constitute all or substantially all
     of the assets of the Seller. The Seller does not intend to, and does not
     believe that it will, incur debts or obligations beyond its ability to pay
     such debts and obligations as they mature.

                    (ii) The Seller will acquire the Seller's Residual Interest
     Certificates for its own account and not with a view to, or sale or
     transfer in connection with, any distribution thereof, in whole or in part,
     in any manner that would violate the Securities Act or any applicable state
     securities laws.

                    (iii) The Seller understands that (A) the Seller's Residual
     Interest Certificates have not been and will not be registered under the
     Securities Act or registered or qualified under any applicable state
     securities laws, (B) neither the Purchaser nor any other party is obligated
     so to register or qualify the Seller's Residual Interest Certificates and
     (C) neither the Seller's Residual Interest Certificates nor any security
     issued in exchange therefor or in lieu thereof may be resold or transferred
     unless it is (1) registered pursuant to the Securities Act and registered
     or

                                      -5-
<PAGE>

     qualified pursuant to any applicable state securities laws or (2) sold or
     transferred in a transaction which is exempt from such registration and
     qualification and the Certificate Registrar has received the certifications
     and/or opinions of counsel required by the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.

                    (iv) The Seller understands that it may not sell or
     otherwise transfer the Seller's Residual Interest Certificates, any
     security issued in exchange therefor or in lieu thereof or any interest in
     the foregoing except in compliance with the provisions of Section 5.02 of
     the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, which provisions it has or, as of the
     Closing Date, will have carefully reviewed, and that the Seller's Residual
     Interest Certificates will bear legends that identify the transfer
     restrictions to which such Certificates are subject.

                    (v) Neither the Seller nor anyone acting on its behalf has
     (A) offered, transferred, pledged, sold or otherwise disposed of any
     Seller's Residual Interest Certificate, any interest in a Seller's Residual
     Interest Certificate or any other similar security to any person in any
     manner, (B) solicited any offer to buy or accept a transfer, pledge or
     other disposition of any Seller's Residual Interest Certificate, any
     interest in a Seller's Residual Interest Certificate or any other similar
     security from any person in any manner, (C) otherwise approached or
     negotiated with respect to any Seller's Residual Interest Certificate, any
     interest in a Seller's Residual Interest Certificate or any other similar
     security with any person in any manner, (D) made any general solicitation
     by means of general advertising or in any other manner, or (E) taken any
     other action, that (in the case of any of the acts described in clauses (A)
     through (E) above) would constitute a distribution of the Seller's Residual
     Interest Certificates under the Securities Act, would render the
     disposition of the Seller's Residual Interest Certificates a violation of
     Section 5 of the Securities Act or any state securities law or would
     require registration or qualification of the Seller's Residual Interest
     Certificates pursuant thereto. The Seller will not act, nor has it
     authorized nor will it authorize any person to act, in any manner set forth
     in the foregoing sentence with respect to the Seller's Residual Interest
     Certificates, any interest in the Seller's Residual Interest Certificates
     or any other similar security.

                    (vi) The Seller has been furnished with all information
     regarding (A) the Purchaser, (B) the Seller's Residual Interest
     Certificates and distributions thereon, (C) the nature, performance and
     servicing of the Other Loans, (D) the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and
     the Trust Fund, and (E) all related matters, that it has requested.

                    (vii) The Seller is an "accredited investor" within the
     meaning of paragraph (1), (2), (3) or (7) of Rule 501(a) under the
     Securities Act or an entity in which all the equity owners come within such
     paragraphs and has such knowledge and experience in financial and business
     matters as to be capable of evaluating the merits and risks of an
     investment in the Seller's Residual Interest Certificates; the Seller has
     sought such accounting, legal and tax advice as it has considered necessary
     to make an informed investment decision; and the Seller is able to bear the
     economic risks of such an investment and can afford a complete loss of such
     investment.

                    (viii) The Seller is not a Plan and is not directly or
     indirectly acquiring the Seller's Residual Interest Certificates on behalf
     of, as named fiduciary of, as trustee of or with assets of a Plan.

                                      -6-
<PAGE>

                    (ix) The Seller is a United States Tax Person and is not a
     Disqualified Organization.

               (b) The Seller hereby makes, for the benefit of the Purchaser,
with respect to each Mortgage Loan, as of the Closing Date or as of such other
date expressly set forth therein, each of the representations and warranties set
forth on Exhibit B hereto.

               SECTION 4. Representations and Warranties of the Purchaser. In
order to induce the Seller to enter into this Agreement, the Purchaser hereby
represents and warrants for the benefit of the Seller and the Additional Party
as of the date hereof that:

                    (i) The Purchaser is a corporation duly organized, validly
     existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware. The
     Purchaser has the full corporate power and authority and legal right to
     acquire the Mortgage Loans from the Seller and to transfer the Mortgage
     Loans to the Trustee.

                    (ii) This Agreement has been duly and validly authorized,
     executed and delivered by the Purchaser and, assuming due authorization,
     execution and delivery hereof by the Seller and the Additional Party,
     constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Purchaser,
     enforceable against the Purchaser in accordance with its terms, except as
     such enforcement may be limited by (A) bankruptcy, insolvency,
     reorganization, receivership, moratorium or other similar laws affecting
     the enforcement of creditors' rights in general, and (B) general equity
     principles (regardless of whether such enforcement is considered in a
     proceeding in equity or at law).

                    (iii) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
     Purchaser and the Purchaser's performance and compliance with the terms of
     this Agreement will not (A) violate the Purchaser's organizational
     documents, (B) violate any law or regulation or any administrative decree
     or order to which the Purchaser is subject or (C) constitute a default (or
     an event which, with notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a
     default) under, or result in the breach of, any material contract,
     agreement or other instrument to which the Purchaser is a party or by which
     the Purchaser is bound.

                    (iv) Except as may be required under federal or state
     securities laws (and which will be obtained on a timely basis), no consent,
     approval, authorization or order of, registration or filing with, or notice
     to, any governmental authority or court, is required for the execution,
     delivery and performance by the Purchaser of or compliance by the Purchaser
     with this Agreement, or the consummation by the Purchaser of any
     transaction described in this Agreement.

                    (v) Under GAAP and for federal income tax purposes, the
     Purchaser will report the transfer of the Mortgage Loans by the Seller to
     the Purchaser, as provided herein, as a sale of the Mortgage Loans to the
     Purchaser in exchange for the consideration specified in Section 1 hereof.

               SECTION 5. Notice of Breach; Cure; Repurchase.

                                      -7-
<PAGE>

               (a) If the Seller or the Additional Party discovers or receives
notice of a Document Defect or a breach of any of its representations and
warranties made pursuant to Section 3(b) hereof (each such breach, a "Breach")
relating to any Mortgage Loan, and such Document Defect or Breach materially and
adversely affects the interests of the Purchaser in such Mortgage Loan (in which
case any such Document Defect or Breach would be a "Material Document Defect" or
a "Material Breach", as the case may be), then (subject to Section 5(b)) the
Seller shall, within 90 days after its discovery or receipt of notice of such
Material Document Defect or Material Breach (or, in the case of a Material
Document Defect or Material Breach that affects whether a Mortgage Loan was, as
of the Closing Date, is or will continue to be a "qualified mortgage" within the
meaning of the REMIC Provisions, not later than 90 days of any party discovering
such Material Document Defect or Material Breach) (such 90-day period, in either
case, the "Initial Resolution Period"), (i) cure such Material Document Defect
or Material Breach, as the case may be, in all material respects, which cure
shall include payment of any Additional Trust Fund Expenses associated
therewith, or (ii) repurchase the affected Mortgage Loan (or the related
Mortgaged Property) from, and in accordance with the directions of, the
Purchaser or its designee, at a price equal to the Purchase Price; provided that
if (i) any such Material Breach or Material Document Defect, as the case may be,
does not affect whether the Mortgage Loan was, as of the Closing Date, is or
will continue to be a "qualified mortgage" within the meaning of Section
860G(a)(3) of the Code (a "Qualified Mortgage"), (ii) such Material Breach or
Material Document Defect, as the case may be, is capable of being cured but not
within the applicable Initial Resolution Period, (iii) the Seller has commenced
and is diligently proceeding with the cure of such Material Breach or Material
Document Defect, as the case may be, within the applicable Initial Resolution
Period, and (iv) the Seller shall have delivered to the Purchaser a
certification executed on behalf of the Seller by an officer thereof confirming
that such Material Breach or Material Document Defect, as the case may be, is
not capable of being cured within the applicable Initial Resolution Period,
setting forth what actions the Seller is pursuing in connection with the cure
thereof and stating that the Seller anticipates that such Material Breach or
Material Document Defect, as the case may be, will be cured within an additional
period not to exceed 90 days beyond the end of the applicable Initial Resolution
Period, then the Seller shall have such additional 90-day period (the
"Resolution Extension Period") to complete such cure or, failing such, to
repurchase the affected Mortgage Loan (or the related Mortgaged Property); and
provided, further, that, if any such Material Document Defect is still not cured
after the initial 90-day period and any such additional 90-day period solely due
to the failure of the Seller to have received the recorded document, then the
Seller shall be entitled to continue to defer its cure and repurchase
obligations in respect of such Document Defect so long as the Seller certifies
to the Purchaser every 30 days thereafter that the Document Defect is still in
effect solely because of its failure to have received the recorded document and
that the Seller is diligently pursuing the cure of such defect (specifying the
actions being taken), except that no such deferral of cure or repurchase may
continue beyond the second anniversary of the Closing Date. Any such repurchase
of a Mortgage Loan shall be on a whole loan, servicing released basis. The
Seller and the Additional Party shall have no obligation to monitor the Mortgage
Loans regarding the existence of a Breach or Document Defect, but if the Seller
or the Additional Party discovers a Material Breach or Material Document Defect
with respect to a Mortgage Loan, it will notify the Purchaser.

               In connection with any repurchase of a Mortgage Loan that is an
Early Defeasance Mortgage Loan pursuant to this Section 5(a), the Purchaser
shall effect, and the Seller shall pay all reasonable costs and expenses,
including the costs of any opinions of counsel under the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement, relating to, a "qualified liquidation" of the related Loan REMIC in
accordance with the REMIC Provisions.

               (b) If one or more (but not all) of the Mortgage Loans
constituting a Cross-Collateralized Group are to be repurchased by the Seller as
contemplated by Section 5(a), then, prior to the subject repurchase, the
Purchaser or its designee shall use reasonable efforts, subject to the terms of
the related Mortgage Loans, to prepare and, to the extent necessary and
appropriate, have executed by the related Mortgagor and record, such
documentation as may be necessary to terminate the cross-collateralization
between the Mortgage Loans in such Cross-Collateralized Group that are to be
repurchased, on the one hand, and the remaining Mortgage Loans therein, on the
other hand, such that those two groups of Mortgage Loans are each secured only
by the Mortgaged Properties identified in the Mortgage Loan Schedule as directly
corresponding thereto; provided that, if such Cross-Collateralized Group is
still subject to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, then no such termination
shall be effected unless and until (i) the Purchaser or its designee has
received from the Seller (A) an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such
termination will not cause an Adverse REMIC Event to occur with respect to any
REMIC Pool or an Adverse Grantor Trust Event with respect to the Grantor Trust
and (B) written confirmation from each Rating Agency that such termination will
not cause an Adverse Rating Event to occur with respect to any Class of
Certificates and (ii) the Controlling Class Representative (if one is acting)
has consented (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld and shall be
deemed to have been given if no written objection is received by the Seller
within 10 days of the Controlling Class Representative's receipt of a written
request for such consent); and provided, further, that the Seller may, at its
option, purchase the entire Cross-Collateralized Group in lieu of terminating
the cross-collateralization. All costs and expenses incurred by the Purchaser or
its designee pursuant to this paragraph shall be included in the calculation of
Purchase Price for the Mortgage Loan(s) to be repurchased. If the
cross-collateralization of any Cross-Collateralized Group is not or cannot be
terminated as contemplated by this paragraph, then, for purposes of (i)
determining whether any Breach or Document Defect, as the case may be,
materially and adversely affects the interests of the Purchaser in any Mortgage
Loan, and (ii) the application of remedies, such Cross-Collateralized Group
shall be treated as a single Mortgage Loan.

               It shall be a condition to any repurchase of a Mortgage Loan by
the Seller pursuant to Section 5(a) that the Purchaser shall have executed and
delivered such instruments of transfer or assignment then presented to it by the
Seller, in each case without recourse, as shall be necessary to vest in the
Seller the legal and beneficial ownership of such Mortgage Loan (including any
property acquired in respect thereof or proceeds of any insurance policy with
respect thereto), to the extent that such ownership interest was transferred to
the Purchaser hereunder. If any Mortgage Loan is to be repurchased as
contemplated by Section 5(a), the Seller shall amend the Mortgage Loan Schedule
to reflect the removal of such Mortgage Loan and shall forward such amended
schedule to the Purchaser.

               (c) It is understood and agreed that the obligations of the
Seller set forth in Section 5(a) to cure any Material Breach or Material
Document Defect or to repurchase such Mortgage Loan, constitute the sole
remedies available to the Purchaser with respect to any Breach or Document
Defect.

               SECTION 6. Repurchase of Early Defeasance Mortgage Loans. If the
Purchaser or the Master Servicer notifies the Seller or the Additional Party
that the borrower under any of the Mortgage Loans that are Early Defeasance
Mortgage Loans intends to defease the related Early Defeasance Mortgage Loan
prior to the second anniversary of the date of initial issuance of the
Certificates, the Seller shall promptly repurchase the affected Early Defeasance
Mortgage Loan prior to its being defeased by the subject borrower, with such
repurchase to be made at the related Purchase Price in accordance with the
directions of the Master Servicer. Upon the repurchase of a Mortgage Loan that
is

                                      -9-
<PAGE>

an Early Defeasance Mortgage Loan pursuant to this Section 6, the Purchaser
shall effect, and the Seller shall pay all reasonable costs and expenses,
including the costs of any opinions of counsel under the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement, relating to, a "qualified liquidation" of the related Loan REMIC in
accordance with the REMIC Provisions.

               SECTION 7. Obligations of the Additional Party. The Additional
Party hereby covenants and agrees with the Purchaser that the Additional Party
shall be liable to the Purchaser and any designee thereof to the same extent as
the Seller as set forth herein, for all the obligations of the Seller under
Sections 5 and 6 hereof. The Additional Party further agrees that the Purchaser
shall not be bound or obligated to initially request the Seller to perform any
of its obligations hereunder, but may instead initially request the Additional
Party to perform such obligations. Additionally, the Additional Party agrees
that the Purchaser shall not be bound or obligated in anyway to exhaust recourse
against the Seller before being entitled to demand the performance by the
Additional Party of its obligations hereunder. Performance by the Additional
Party of any of the Seller's obligations hereunder shall be deemed to be
performance thereof by the Seller.

               SECTION 8. Closing. The closing of the sale of the Mortgage Loans
(the "Closing") shall be held at the offices of Sidley Austin Brown & Wood LLP,
787 Seventh Avenue, New York, New York 10019 at 10:00 A.M., New York City time,
on the Closing Date.

               The Closing shall be subject to each of the following conditions:

               (a) All of the representations and warranties of the Seller set
forth in or made pursuant to Sections 3(a) and 3(b) of this Agreement, and all
of the representations and warranties of the Purchaser set forth in Section 4 of
this Agreement, shall be true and correct in all material respects as of the
Closing Date;

               (b) Insofar as it affects the obligations of the Seller
hereunder, the Pooling and Servicing Agreement shall be in a form mutually
acceptable to the Purchaser and the Seller;

               (c) All documents specified in Section 9 of this Agreement (the
"Closing Documents"), in such forms as are reasonably acceptable to the
Purchaser, shall be duly executed and delivered by all signatories as required
pursuant to the respective terms thereof;

               (d) The Seller shall have delivered and released to the Trustee
(or a Custodian on its behalf), the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer all
documents and funds required to be delivered to the Trustee, the Master Servicer
and the Special Servicer, respectively, pursuant to Section 2 of this Agreement;

               (e) All other terms and conditions of this Agreement required to
be complied with on or before the Closing Date shall have been complied with in
all material respects, and the Seller shall have the ability to comply with all
terms and conditions and perform all duties and obligations required to be
complied with or performed after the Closing Date;

               (f) The Seller shall have paid all fees and expenses payable by
it to the Purchaser or otherwise pursuant to this Agreement; and

                                      -10-
<PAGE>

               (g) Neither the Underwriting Agreement nor the Certificate
Purchase Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms.

               Both parties agree to use their best efforts to perform their
respective obligations hereunder in a manner that will enable the Purchaser to
purchase the Mortgage Loans on the Closing Date.

               SECTION 9. Closing Documents. The Closing Documents shall consist

contemplated hereby;

               (k) A favorable opinion of in-house counsel to each of the

attached hereto as Exhibit C-2, dated the Closing Date and addressed to the

other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Underwriting Agreement
and the Certificate Purchase Agreement shall be payable by the Seller.

               SECTION 11. Grant of a Security Interest. The parties hereto
agree that it is their express intent that the conveyance of the Mortgage Loans
by the Seller to the Purchaser as provided in Section 2 hereof be, and be
construed as, a sale of the Mortgage Loans by the Seller to the Purchaser and
not as a pledge of the Mortgage Loans by the Seller to the Purchaser to secure a
debt or other obligation of the Seller. However, if, notwithstanding the
aforementioned intent of the parties, the Mortgage Loans

                                      -12-
<PAGE>

are held to be property of the Seller, then it is the express intent of the
parties that: (i) such conveyance shall be deemed to be a pledge of the Mortgage
Loans by the Seller to the Purchaser to secure a debt or other obligation of the
Seller; (ii) this Agreement shall be deemed to be a security agreement within
the meaning of Articles 8 and 9 of the applicable Uniform Commercial Code; (iii)
the conveyance provided for in Section 2 hereof shall be deemed to be a grant by
the Seller to the Purchaser of a security interest in all of the Seller's right,
title and interest in and to the Mortgage Loans, and all amounts payable to the
holder of the Mortgage Loans in accordance with the terms thereof (other than
the right to receive the Retained Assumption Fee), and all proceeds of the
conversion, voluntary or involuntary, of the foregoing into cash, instruments,
securities or other property; (iv) the assignment to the Trustee of the interest
of the Purchaser in and to the Mortgage Loans shall be deemed to be an
assignment of any security interest created hereunder; (v) the possession by the
Trustee or any of its agents, including, without limitation, the Custodian, of
the Mortgage Notes for the Mortgage Loans, and such other items of property as
constitute instruments, money, negotiable documents or chattel paper shall be
deemed to be "possession by the secured party" for purposes of perfecting the
security interest pursuant to Section 9-313 of the applicable Uniform Commercial
Code; and (vi) notifications to persons (other than the Trustee) holding such
property, and acknowledgments, receipts or confirmations from such persons
holding such property, shall be deemed notifications to, or acknowledgments,
receipts or confirmations from, financial intermediaries, bailees or agents (as
applicable) of the secured party for the purpose of perfecting such security
interest under applicable law. The Seller and the Purchaser shall, to the extent
consistent with this Agreement, take such actions as may be necessary to ensure
that, if this Agreement were deemed to create a security interest in the
Mortgage Loans, such security interest would be deemed to be a perfected
security interest of first priority under applicable law and will be maintained
as such throughout the term of this Agreement and the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement.

               SECTION 12. Notices. All notices, copies, requests, consents,
demands and other communications required hereunder shall be in writing and
telecopied or delivered to the intended recipient at the "Address for Notices"
specified beneath its name on the signature pages hereof or, as to any party, at
such other address as shall be designated by such party in a notice hereunder to
the other parties. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, all such
communications shall be deemed to have been duly given when transmitted by
telecopier or personally delivered or, in the case of a mailed notice, upon
receipt, in each case given or addressed as aforesaid.

               SECTION 13. Representations, Warranties and Agreements to Survive
Delivery. All representations, warranties and agreements contained in this
Agreement, incorporated herein by reference or contained in the certificates of
officers of the Seller, the Additional Party and/or the Co-Indemnitor submitted
pursuant hereto, shall remain operative and in full force and effect and shall
survive delivery of the Mortgage Loans by the Seller to the Purchaser (and by
the Purchaser to the Trustee).

               SECTION 14. Severability of Provisions. Any part, provision,
representation, warranty or covenant of this Agreement that is prohibited or
which is held to be void or unenforceable shall be ineffective to the extent of
such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining
provisions hereof. Any part, provision, representation, warranty or covenant of
this Agreement that is prohibited or unenforceable or is held to be void or
unenforceable in any particular jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be
ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without
invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or
unenforceability in any particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render
unenforceable such provision in any other

                                      -13-
<PAGE>

jurisdiction. To the extent permitted by applicable law, the parties hereto
waive any provision of law which prohibits or renders void or unenforceable any
provision hereof.

               SECTION 15. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any
number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, but which together
shall constitute one and the same agreement.

               SECTION 16. GOVERNING LAW; CONSENT TO JURISDICTION. THIS
AGREEMENT WILL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE
STATE OF NEW YORK, APPLICABLE TO AGREEMENTS NEGOTIATED, MADE AND TO BE PERFORMED
ENTIRELY IN SAID STATE. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW,
THE SELLER AND THE PURCHASER EACH HEREBY IRREVOCABLY (I) SUBMITS TO THE
JURISDICTION OF ANY NEW YORK STATE AND FEDERAL COURTS SITTING IN NEW YORK CITY
WITH RESPECT TO MATTERS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT; (II)
AGREES THAT ALL CLAIMS WITH RESPECT TO SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING MAY BE HEARD
AND DETERMINED IN SUCH NEW YORK STATE OR FEDERAL COURTS; (III) WAIVES, TO THE
FULLEST POSSIBLE EXTENT, THE DEFENSE OF AN INCONVENIENT FORUM; AND (IV) AGREES
THAT A FINAL JUDGMENT IN ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING SHALL BE CONCLUSIVE AND
MAY BE ENFORCED IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS BY SUIT ON THE JUDGMENT OR IN ANY OTHER
MANNER PROVIDED BY LAW.

               SECTION 17. Further Assurances. The Seller, the Additional Party
and the Purchaser agree to execute and deliver such instruments and take such
further actions as any other party may, from time to time, reasonably request in
order to effectuate the purposes and to carry out the terms of this Agreement.

               SECTION 18. Successors and Assigns. The rights and obligations of
the Seller and the Additional Party under this Agreement shall not be assigned
by the Seller or the Additional Party without the prior written consent of the
Purchaser, except that any person into which the Seller or the Additional Party,
as the case may be, may be merged or consolidated, or any corporation resulting
from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which the Seller or the
Additional Party, as the case may be, is a party, or any person succeeding to
all or substantially all of the business of the Seller or the Additional Party,
shall be the successor to the Seller or the Additional Party, as the case may
be, hereunder. The Purchaser has the right to assign its interest under this
Agreement, in whole or in part, as may be required to effect the purposes of the
Pooling and Servicing Agreement, and the assignee shall, to the extent of such
assignment, succeed to the rights and obligations hereunder of the Purchaser.
Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of
and be enforceable by the Seller, the Purchaser, and their respective successors
and permitted assigns.

               SECTION 19. Amendments. No term or provision of this Agreement
may be waived or modified unless such waiver or modification is in writing and
signed by a duly authorized officer of the party against whom such waiver or
modification is sought to be enforced. The Seller's and the Additional Party's
obligations hereunder shall in no way be expanded, changed or otherwise affected
by any amendment of or modification to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement,
unless the Seller or the Additional Party, as applicable, has consented to such
amendment or modification in writing.

                                    EXHIBIT B

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

          Except as set forth on the schedule of exceptions attached hereto as
Schedule I, the Seller hereby represents and warrants to the Purchaser, with
respect to each Mortgage Loan, as of the Closing Date or such other date
specified in the particular representation and warranty, that:

               (i) Mortgage Loan Schedule. The information pertaining to such
     Mortgage Loan set forth in the Mortgage Loan Schedule was true and correct
     in all material respects as of its Due Date in December 2002.

               (ii) Legal Compliance. If such Mortgage Loan was originated by
     the Seller or an Affiliate of the Seller, then, as of the date of its
     origination, such Mortgage Loan complied in all material respects with, or
     was exempt from, all requirements of federal, state or local law relating
     to the origination of such Mortgage Loan; and, if such Mortgage Loan was
     not originated by the Seller or an Affiliate of the Seller, then, to the
     Seller's actual knowledge, after having performed the type of due diligence
     customarily performed by prudent institutional commercial and multifamily
     mortgage lenders, as of the date of its origination, such Mortgage Loan
     complied in all material respects with, or was exempt from, all
     requirements of federal, state or local law relating to the origination of
     such Mortgage Loan.

               (iii) Ownership of Mortgage Loan. The Seller owns such Mortgage
     Loan, has good title thereto, has full right, power and authority to sell,
     assign and transfer such Mortgage Loan and is transferring such Mortgage
     Loan free and clear of any and all liens, pledges, charges or security
     interests of any nature encumbering such Mortgage Loan, exclusive of the
     servicing rights pertaining thereto and exclusive of the Retained
     Assumption Fee; no provision of the Mortgage Note, Mortgage(s) or other
     loan documents relating to such Mortgage Loan prohibits or restricts the
     Seller's right to assign or transfer such Mortgage Loan to the Trustee; no
     governmental or regulatory approval or consent is required for the sale of
     such Mortgage Loan by the Seller; and the Seller has validly conveyed to
     the Trustee a legal and beneficial interest in and to such Mortgage Loan
     free and clear of any lien, claim or encumbrance of any nature.

               (iv) No Holdback. The proceeds of such Mortgage Loan have been
     fully disbursed (except in those cases where the full amount of the
     Mortgage Loan has been disbursed but a portion thereof is being held in
     escrow or reserve accounts to be released pending the satisfaction of
     certain conditions relating to leasing, repairs or other matters with
     respect to the related Mortgaged Property) and there is no requirement for
     future advances thereunder.

               (v) Loan Document Status. Each of the related Mortgage Note,
     Mortgage(s), Assignment(s) of Leases, if any, and other agreements executed
     in favor of the lender in connection therewith is the legal, valid and
     binding obligation of the maker

     thereof (subject to the non-recourse provisions therein and any state
     anti-deficiency legislation), enforceable in accordance with its terms,
     except that (A) such enforcement may be limited by (1) bankruptcy,
     insolvency, receivership, reorganization, liquidation, voidable preference,
     fraudulent conveyance and transfer, moratorium and/or other similar laws
     affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally, and (2) general
     principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforcement is considered
     in a proceeding in equity or at law), and (B) certain provisions in the
     subject agreement or instrument may be further limited or rendered
     unenforceable by applicable law, but subject to the limitations set forth
     in the foregoing clause (A), such limitations will not render that subject
     agreement or instrument invalid as a whole or substantially interfere with
     the mortgagee's realization of the principal benefits and/or security
     provided by the subject agreement or instrument. Except as set forth on
     Schedule I-v, the Mortgage Loan is non-recourse to the Mortgagor or any
     other Person except to the extent provided in certain nonrecourse carveouts
     and/or in any applicable guarantees. Except as set forth on Schedule I-v,
     if such Mortgage Loan has a Cut-off Date Balance of $15 million or more,
     the related Mortgagor or another Person has agreed to be liable for all
     liabilities, costs, losses, damages, expenses or claims suffered or
     incurred by the mortgagee under such Mortgage Loan by reason of or in
     connection with and to the extent of (A) any material intentional fraud or
     material intentional misrepresentation by the related Mortgagor and (B) any
     breach on the part of the related Mortgagor of any environmental
     representations, warranties and covenants contained in the related Mortgage
     Loan documents; provided that, instead of any breach described in clause
     (B) of this sentence, the related Mortgagor or such other Person may
     instead be responsible for liabilities, costs, losses, damages, expenses
     and claims resulting from a breach of the obligations and indemnities of
     the related Mortgagor under the related Mortgage Loan documents relating to
     hazardous or toxic substances, radon or compliance with environmental laws.

               (vi) No Right of Rescission. As of the date of origination,
     subject to the limitations and exceptions as to enforceability set forth in
     paragraph (v) above, there was no valid offset, defense, counterclaim or
     right to rescission with respect to any of the related Mortgage Note,
     Mortgage(s) or other agreements executed in connection with such Mortgage
     Loan; and, as of the Closing Date, subject to the limitations and
     exceptions as to enforceability set forth in paragraph (v) above, there is
     no valid offset, defense, counterclaim or right to rescission with respect
     to such Mortgage Note, Mortgage(s) or other agreements executed in
     connection with such Mortgage Loan; and, to the actual knowledge of the
     Seller, no such claim has been asserted.

               (vii) Assignments. The assignment of the related Mortgage(s) and
     Assignment(s) of Leases to the Trustee constitutes the legal, valid,
     binding and, subject to the limitations and exceptions as to enforceability
     set forth in paragraph (v) above, enforceable assignment of such documents
     (provided that the unenforceability of any such assignment based on
     bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, reorganization, liquidation,
     moratorium and/or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of
     creditors' rights generally or based on general principles of equity
     (regardless of whether such enforcement is considered in a proceeding in
     equity or at law) shall be a breach of this representation and warranty
     only upon the declaration by a court with jurisdiction in the matter that
     such assignment is to be unenforceable on such basis).

               (viii) First Lien. Each related Mortgage is a valid and, subject
     to the limitations and exceptions in paragraph (v) above, enforceable first
     lien on the related Mortgaged Property and all buildings thereon, which
     Mortgaged Property is free and clear of all encumbrances and liens having
     priority over or on a parity with the first lien of such Mortgage, except
     for the following (collectively, the "Permitted Encumbrances"): (A) the
     lien for real estate taxes, water charges, sewer rents and assessments not
     yet due and payable; (B) covenants, conditions and restrictions, rights of
     way, easements and other matters that are of public record or that are
     omitted as exceptions in the related lender's title insurance policy (or,
     if not yet issued, omitted as exceptions in a pro forma title policy or
     title policy commitment); (C) exceptions and exclusions specifically
     referred to in the related lender's title insurance policy (or, if not yet
     issued, referred to in a pro forma title policy or title policy
     commitment); (D) other matters to which like properties are commonly
     subject; (E) the rights of tenants (as tenants only) under leases
     (including subleases) pertaining to the related Mortgaged Property; (F)
     condominium declarations of record and identified in the related lender's
     title insurance policy (or, if not yet issued, identified in a pro forma
     title policy or title policy commitment); and (G) if such Mortgage Loan
     constitutes a Cross-Collateralized Mortgage Loan, the lien of the Mortgage
     for another Mortgage Loan contained in the same Cross-Collateralized Group.
     With respect to each Mortgage Loan, such Permitted Encumbrances do not,
     individually or in the aggregate, materially and adversely interfere with
     the benefits of the security intended to be provided by the related
     Mortgage, the current principal use or operation of the related Mortgaged
     Property or the ability of the related Mortgaged Property to generate
     sufficient cashflow to enable the related Mortgagor to timely pay in full
     the principal and interest on the related Mortgage Note (other than a
     Balloon Payment, which would require a refinancing). If the related
     Mortgaged Property is operated as a nursing facility or a hospitality
     property, the related Mortgage, together with any security agreement,
     chattel mortgage or similar agreement and UCC financing statement, if any,
     establishes and creates a first priority, perfected security interest
     (subject only to any prior purchase money security interest, revolving
     credit lines and any personal property leases), to the extent such security
     interest can be perfected by the recordation of a Mortgage or the filing of
     a UCC financing statement, in all personal property identified therein or
     on a schedule attached thereto, which is owned by the Mortgagor and is used
     in, and reasonably necessary to, the operation of the related Mortgaged
     Property.

               (ix) Financing Statements. If the related Mortgaged Property is
     operated as a hospitality property, the Seller has, or has caused to be,
     filed and/or recorded, or submitted for filing and/or recording, in
     appropriate public filing and recording offices, all UCC-1 financing
     statements necessary to create and perfect a security interest in and lien
     on the items of personal property described therein (such description being
     generally consistent with the practices of prudent commercial mortgage
     lenders) (which personal property includes all furniture, fixtures,
     equipment and other personal property located at the subject Mortgaged
     Property) that are owned by the related Mortgagor and located at, and
     necessary or material to the operation of, the subject Mortgaged Property,
     to the extent perfection may be effected pursuant to applicable law by
     recording or filing.
<PAGE>

               (x) Taxes and Assessments. All taxes, governmental assessments,
     water charges, sewer rents or similar governmental charges which, in all
     such cases, were directly related to the Mortgaged Property and could
     constitute liens on the Mortgaged Property prior to the lien of the
     Mortgage and all ground rents that prior to the related Due Date in
     December 2002 became due and payable in respect of, and materially affect,
     any related Mortgaged Property have been paid or are escrowed for or are
     not yet delinquent, and the Seller knows of no unpaid tax, assessment,
     ground rent, water charges or sewer rent, which, in all such cases, were
     directly related to the Mortgaged Property and could constitute liens on
     the Mortgaged Property prior to the lien of the Mortgage, that prior to the
     Closing Date became due and delinquent in respect of any related Mortgaged
     Property, or in any such case an escrow of funds in an amount sufficient to
     cover such payments has been established.

               (xi) No Material Damage. As of the date of origination of each
     Mortgage Loan and, to the actual knowledge of the Seller, as of the Closing
     Date, there was no pending proceeding for the total or partial condemnation
     of any related Mortgaged Property that materially affects the value
     thereof, and such Mortgaged Property is free of material damage. If such
     Mortgage Loan has a Cut-off Date Balance of $15 million or more, then
     (except for certain amounts not greater than amounts which would be
     considered prudent by an institutional commercial mortgage lender with
     respect to a similar mortgage loan and which are set forth in the related
     Mortgage or other loan documents relating to such Mortgage Loan, and
     subject to any rights of the lessor under any related Ground Lease) any
     condemnation awards will be applied either to the repair or restoration of
     all or part of the related Mortgaged Property or the reduction of the
     outstanding principal balance of such Mortgage Loan.

               (xii) Title Insurance. Each related Mortgaged Property is covered
     by an ALTA (or its equivalent) lender's title insurance policy issued by a
     nationally recognized title insurance company, insuring that each related
     Mortgage is a valid first lien on such Mortgaged Property in the original
     principal amount of such Mortgage Loan after all advances of principal,
     subject only to Permitted Encumbrances, or there is a binding commitment or
     binding pro forma from a title insurer qualified and/or licensed in the
     applicable jurisdiction, as required, to issue such policy; such title
     insurance policy, if issued, is in full force and effect, all premiums have
     been paid, is freely assignable and will inure to the benefit of the
     Trustee as mortgagee of record, or any such commitment or binding pro forma
     is a legal, valid and binding obligation of such insurer; no claims have
     been made by the Seller under such title insurance policy, if issued; and
     neither the Seller nor, to the best of the Seller's knowledge, any
     Affiliate of the Seller has done, by act or omission, anything that would
     materially impair the coverage of any such title insurance policy; such
     policy or commitment or binding pro forma contains no exclusion for (or
     alternatively it insures, unless such coverage is unavailable in the
     relevant jurisdiction) (A) access to a public road, (B) that there is no
     material encroachment by any improvements on the Mortgaged Property, and
     (C) that the area shown on the survey materially conforms to the legal
     description of the Mortgaged Property.

               (xiii) Property Insurance. As of the date of its origination and,
     to the best of the Seller's knowledge, as of the Closing Date, all
     insurance required under each
<PAGE>

     related Mortgage (except where a tenant under a lease is permitted to
     insure or self-insure) was in full force and effect with respect to each
     related Mortgaged Property; such insurance included (A) "all risk" or fire
     and extended perils insurance, in an amount (subject to a customary
     deductible) at least equal to the lesser of (i) 100% of the full insurable
     replacement cost of the improvements located on such Mortgaged Property and
     (ii) the initial principal balance of such Mortgage Loan, or the portion
     thereof allocable to such Mortgaged Property, (B) except as set forth on
     Schedule I-xiii, business interruption or rental loss insurance for a
     period of not less than 12 months, (C) comprehensive general liability
     insurance in an amount not less than $1 million per occurrence, (D)
     workers' compensation insurance (if the related Mortgagor has employees and
     if required by applicable law), and (E) if (1) such Mortgage Loan is
     secured by a Mortgaged Property located in the State of California in or
     "seismic zone" 3 or 4 and (2) a seismic assessment revealed a maximum
     probable or bounded loss in excess of 20% of the amount of the estimated
     replacement cost of the improvements on such Mortgaged Property, earthquake
     insurance; it is an event of default under such Mortgage Loan if the
     above-described insurance coverage is not maintained by the related
     Mortgagor, and any reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by
     the mortgagee in connection with such default in obtaining such insurance
     coverage are recoverable from the related Mortgagor; the related Mortgage
     Loan documents require that the related insurance policies provide that
     they may not be terminated without at least 10 days' prior notice to the
     mortgagee and, to the Seller's knowledge, it has not received any such
     notice; the related insurance certificates (other than those limited to
     liability protection) name the mortgagee and its successors as mortgagee or
     loss payee; no notice of termination or cancellation with respect to any
     such insurance policy has been received by the Seller; all premiums under
     any such insurance policy have been paid through the related Due Date in
     December 2002; all such insurance policies are required to be maintained
     with insurance companies having "financial strength" or "claims paying
     ability" ratings of at least "A:VII" from A.M. Best Company or at least
     "BBB+" (or equivalent) from a nationally recognized statistical rating
     agency (or, with respect to certain blanket insurance policies, such other
     ratings as are in compliance with S&P's applicable criteria); and, except
     for certain amounts not greater than amounts which would be considered
     prudent by an institutional commercial mortgage lender with respect to a
     similar mortgage loan and which are set forth in the related Mortgage or
     other loan documents relating to such Mortgage Loan, and subject to the
     rights of the lessor under any related Ground Lease, any insurance proceeds
     will be applied either to the repair or restoration of all or part of the
     related Mortgaged Property or the reduction of the outstanding principal
     balance of such Mortgage Loan. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
     this paragraph (xiii), with regard to insurance for acts of terrorism, any
     such insurance and the amount thereof may be limited by the commercial
     availability of such coverage, whether the mortgagee may reasonably require
     such insurance, certain limitations with respect to the cost thereof and/or
     whether such hazards are at the time commonly insured against for property
     similar to the related Mortgaged Property located in or around the region
     in which the Mortgaged Property is located.

               (xiv) No Material Defaults. Other than payments due but not yet
     30 days or more delinquent, there is, to the actual knowledge of the
     Seller, (A) no material default, breach, violation or event of acceleration
     existing under the related Mortgage
<PAGE>

     Note, the related Mortgage or other loan documents relating to such
     Mortgage Loan, and (B) no event which, with the passage of time or with
     notice and the expiration of any grace or cure period, would constitute a
     material default, breach, violation or event of acceleration under any of
     such documents; provided, however, that this representation and warranty
     does not cover any default, breach, violation or event of acceleration that
     specifically pertains to or arises out of the subject matter otherwise
     covered by any other representation and warranty made by the Seller on this
     Exhibit B. If the Seller had knowledge of any material default, breach,
     violation or event of acceleration under any of such documents, the Seller
     has not waived any such material default, breach, violation or event of
     acceleration. Under the terms of such Mortgage Loan, no person or party
     other than the mortgagee or its servicing agent may declare an event of
     default or accelerate the related indebtedness under such Mortgage Loan.

               (xv) No Payment Delinquency. As of the Closing Date, such
     Mortgage Loan is not, and in the prior 12 months (or since the date of
     origination if such Mortgage Loan has been originated within the past 12
     months), has not been, 30 days or more past due in respect of any Monthly
     Payment.

               (xvi) Interest Accrual Basis. Such Mortgage Loan accrues interest
     on an Actual/360 Basis or on a 30/360 Basis; and such Mortgage Loan accrues
     interest (payable monthly in arrears) at a fixed rate of interest
     throughout the remaining term thereof (except if such Mortgage Loan is an
     ARD Mortgage Loan, in which case the accrual rate for interest will
     increase after its Anticipated Repayment Date, and except in connection
     with the occurrence of a default and the accrual of default interest).

               (xvii) Subordinate Debt. Except as set forth on Schedule I-xvii,
     each related Mortgage or other loan document relating to such Mortgage Loan
     does not provide for or permit, without the prior written consent of the
     holder of the related Mortgage Note, any related Mortgaged Property to
     secure any other promissory note or debt (other than another Mortgage Loan
     in the Trust Fund).

               (xviii) Qualified Mortgage. Such Mortgage Loan is a "qualified
     mortgage" within the meaning of Section 860G(a)(3) of the Code.
     Accordingly, either as of the date of origination or the Closing Date, the
     fair market value of the real property securing such Mortgage Loan was not
     less than 80% of the "adjusted issue price" (within the meaning of the
     REMIC Provisions) of such Mortgage Loan. For purposes of the preceding
     sentence, the fair market value of the real property securing such Mortgage
     Loan was first reduced by the amount of any lien on such real property that
     is senior to the lien that secures such Mortgage Loan, and was further
     reduced by a proportionate amount of any lien that is on a parity with the
     lien that secures such Mortgage Loan.

               (xix) Prepayment Consideration. Prepayment Premiums and Yield
     Maintenance Charges payable with respect to such Mortgage Loan, if any,
     constitute "customary prepayment penalties" within the meaning of Treasury
     regulation section 1.860G-1(b)(2).
<PAGE>

               (xx) Environmental Conditions. Except as set forth on Schedule
     I-xx, one or more environmental site assessments or transaction screens, or
     one or more updates of a previously conducted environmental assessment or
     transaction screen, were performed by an environmental consulting firm
     independent of the Seller and the Seller's Affiliates with respect to each
     related Mortgaged Property during the 12-month period preceding the Cut-off
     Date, and the Seller, having made no independent inquiry other than to
     review the report(s) prepared in connection with the assessment(s),
     transaction screen(s) and/or update(s) referenced herein, has no knowledge
     of, and has not received actual notice of, any material and adverse
     environmental condition or circumstance affecting such Mortgaged Property
     that was not disclosed in such report(s); all such environmental site
     assessments and transaction screens met ASTM requirements to the extent set
     forth in such report; and none of the environmental reports reveal any
     circumstances or conditions that are in violation of any applicable
     environmental laws, or if such report does reveal such circumstances, then
     (1) the same have been remediated in all material respects, (2) sufficient
     funds have been escrowed or a letter of credit, guaranty or other
     instrument has been delivered for purposes of covering the estimated costs
     of such remediation, (3) the related Mortgagor or other responsible party
     is currently taking remedial or other appropriate action to address the
     environmental issue consistent with the recommendations in such site
     assessment, (4) the cost of the environmental issue relative to the value
     of such Mortgaged Property was de minimis, or (5) environmental insurance
     has been obtained.

               (xxi) Realization Against Real Estate Collateral. The related
     Mortgage Note, Mortgage(s), Assignment(s) of Leases and other loan
     documents securing such Mortgage Loan, if any, contain customary and,
     subject to the limitations and exceptions as to enforceability in paragraph
     (v) above, enforceable provisions such as to render the rights and remedies
     of the holder thereof adequate for the practical realization against the
     related Mortgaged Property or Properties of the principal benefits of the
     security intended to be provided thereby, including realization by judicial
     or, if applicable, non-judicial foreclosure.

               (xxii) Bankruptcy. As of the date of origination of such Mortgage
     Loan, to the Seller's knowledge, after due inquiry, the related Mortgagor
     is not a debtor in any bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency or comparable
     proceeding.

               (xxiii) Loan Security. Such Mortgage Loan is secured by either a
     mortgage on a fee simple interest or a leasehold estate in a commercial
     property or multifamily property, including the related Mortgagor's
     interest in the improvements on the related Mortgaged Property.

               (xxiv) Amortization. Such Mortgage Loan does not provide for
     negative amortization unless such Mortgage Loan is an ARD Mortgage Loan, in
     which case it may occur only after the Anticipated Repayment Date.

               (xxv) Whole Loan. Such Mortgage Loan is a whole loan, contains no
     equity participation by the lender or shared appreciation feature and does
     not provide for
<PAGE>

     any contingent interest in the form of participation in the cash flow of
     the related Mortgaged Property.

               (xxvi) Due-on-Encumbrance. Each Mortgage Loan contains provisions
     for the acceleration of the payment of the unpaid principal balance of such
     Mortgage Loan if, without the prior written consent of the mortgagee or
     Rating Agency confirmation that an Adverse Rating Event would not occur,
     any related Mortgaged Property or direct controlling interest therein, is
     directly encumbered in connection with subordinate financing. To the
     Seller's knowledge, no related Mortgaged Property is encumbered in
     connection with subordinate financing; however, if the related Mortgaged
     Property is listed on Schedule I-xxvi, then certain direct controlling
     equity holders in the related Mortgagor have the right to incur, or are
     known to the Seller to have incurred, debt secured by their ownership
     interest in the related Mortgagor.

               (xxvii) Due-on-Sale. Except with respect to transfers of certain
     non-controlling and/or minority interests in the related Mortgagor as
     specified in the related Mortgage or with respect to transfers of interests
     in the related Mortgagor between immediate family members and with respect
     to transfers by devise, by descent or by operation of law or otherwise upon
     the death or incapacity of a person having an interest in the related
     Mortgagor, each Mortgage Loan contains either (A) provisions for the
     acceleration of the payment of the unpaid principal balance of such
     Mortgage Loan if any related Mortgaged Property or interest therein is
     directly or indirectly transferred or sold without the prior written
     consent of the mortgagee or rating agency confirmation, or (B) provisions
     for the acceleration of the payment of the unpaid principal balance of such
     Mortgage Loan if any related Mortgaged Property or interest therein is
     directly or indirectly transferred or sold without the related Mortgagor
     having satisfied certain conditions specified in the related Mortgage with
     respect to permitted transfers (which conditions are consistent with the
     practices of prudent commercial mortgage lenders).

               (xxviii) Mortgagor Concentration. Such Mortgage Loan, together
     with any other Mortgage Loan made to the same Mortgagor or to an Affiliate
     of such Mortgagor, does not represent more than 5% of the Initial Pool
     Balance.

               (xxix) Waivers; Modifications. Except as set forth in a written
     instrument included in the related Mortgage File, the (a) terms of the
     related Mortgage Note, the related Mortgage(s) and any related loan
     agreement and/or lock-box agreement have not been waived, modified,
     altered, satisfied, impaired, canceled, subordinated or rescinded by
     mortgagee in any manner, and (b) no portion of a related Mortgaged Property
     has been released from the lien of the related Mortgage, in the case of (a)
     and/or (b), to an extent or in a manner that in any such event materially
     and adversely interferes with the mortgagee's realization of the principal
     benefits and/or security intended to be provided by such document or
     instrument.

               (xxx) Inspection. Each related Mortgaged Property was inspected
     by or on behalf of the related originator during the six-month period prior
     to the related origination date.
<PAGE>


               (xxxi) Property Release. The terms of the related Mortgage Note,
     Mortgage(s) or other loan document securing such Mortgage Loan do not
     provide for the release from the lien of such Mortgage of any material
     portion of the related Mortgaged Property that is necessary to the
     operation of such Mortgaged Property and was given material value in the
     underwriting of such Mortgage Loan at origination, without (A) payment in
     full of such Mortgage Loan, (B) delivery of Defeasance Collateral in the
     form of "government securities" within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of
     the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "Investment Company
     Act"), (C) delivery of substitute real property collateral, or (D) payment
     of a release price equal to at least 110% of the amount of such Mortgage
     Loan allocated to the related Mortgaged Property subject to the release.

               (xxxii) Qualifications; Licensing; Zoning. The related Mortgagor
     has covenanted in the Mortgage Loan documents to maintain the related
     Mortgaged Property in compliance in all material respects with, to the
     extent it is not grandfathered under, all applicable laws, zoning
     ordinances, rules, covenants and restrictions affecting the construction,
     occupancy, use and operation of such Mortgaged Property, and the related
     originator performed the type of due diligence in connection with the
     origination of such Mortgage Loan customarily performed by prudent
     institutional commercial and multifamily mortgage lenders with respect to
     the foregoing matters; the Seller has received no notice of any material
     violation of, to the extent is has not been grandfathered under, any
     applicable laws, zoning ordinances, rules, covenants or restrictions
     affecting the construction, occupancy, use or operation of the related
     Mortgaged Property (unless affirmatively covered by the title insurance
     referred to in paragraph (xi) above (or an endorsement thereto)); to the
     Seller's knowledge (based on surveys, opinions, letters from municipalities
     and/or title insurance obtained in connection with the origination of such
     Mortgage Loan), no improvement that was included for the purpose of
     determining the appraised value of the related Mortgaged Property at the
     time of origination of such Mortgage Loan lay outside the boundaries and
     building restriction lines of such property, in effect at the time of
     origination of such Mortgage Loan, to an extent which would have a material
     adverse affect on the related Mortgagor's use and operation of such
     Mortgaged Property (unless grandfathered with respect thereto or
     affirmatively covered by the title insurance referred to in paragraph (xi)
     above (or an endorsement thereto)), and no improvements on adjoining
     properties encroached upon such Mortgaged Property to any material extent.

               (xxxiii) Property Financial Statements. The related Mortgagor has
     covenanted in the Mortgage Loan documents to deliver to the mortgagee
     quarterly and/or annual operating statements and rent rolls of each related
     Mortgaged Property.

               (xxxiv) Single Purpose Entity. Except as set forth on Schedule
     I-xxxiv, (A) if such Mortgage Loan has a Cut-off Date Balance in excess of
     $15 million, then the related Mortgagor is obligated by its organizational
     documents and/or the related Mortgage Loan documents to be a Single Purpose
     Entity for so long as such Mortgage Loan is outstanding; and (B) if such
     Mortgage Loan has a Cut-off Date Balance less than $15 million, the related
     Mortgagor is obligated by its organizational documents and/or the related
     Mortgage Loan documents to own the related Mortgaged Property and no other
<PAGE>

     material asset unrelated to such Mortgaged Property and, except as
     permitted by the related Mortgage Loan documents, not to incur other
     financing for so long as such Mortgage Loan is outstanding.

               (xxxv) Advancing of Funds. No advance of funds has been made,
     directly or indirectly, by the originator or the Seller to the related
     Mortgagor other than pursuant to the related Mortgage Note; and, to the
     actual knowledge of the Seller, no funds have been received from any Person
     other than such Mortgagor for or on account of payments due on the related
     Mortgage Note.

               (xxxvi) Legal Proceedings. To the Seller's actual knowledge,
     there are no pending actions, suits or proceedings by or before any court
     or governmental authority against or affecting the related Mortgagor or any
     related Mortgaged Property that, if determined adversely to such Mortgagor
     or Mortgaged Property, would materially and adversely affect the value of
     such Mortgaged Property or the ability of such Mortgagor to pay principal,
     interest or any other amounts due under such Mortgage Loan.

               (xxxvii) Originator Duly Authorized. To the extent required under
     applicable law, the originator of such Mortgage Loan was qualified and
     authorized to do business in each jurisdiction in which a related Mortgaged
     Property is located at all times when it held such Mortgage Loan to the
     extent necessary to ensure the enforceability of such Mortgage Loan.

               (xxxviii) Trustee under Deed of Trust. If the related Mortgage is
     a deed of trust, a trustee, duly qualified under applicable law to serve as
     such, is properly designated and serving under such Mortgage, and no fees
     and expenses are payable to such trustee except in connection with a
     trustee sale of the related Mortgaged Property following a default or in
     connection with the release of liens securing such Mortgage Loan.

               (xxxix) Cross-Collateralization. The related Mortgaged Property
     is not, to the Seller's knowledge, collateral or security for any mortgage
     loan that is not in the Trust Fund and, if such Mortgage Loan is
     cross-collateralized, it is cross-collateralized only with other Mortgage
     Loans in the Trust Fund. The security interest/lien on each material item
     of collateral for such Mortgage Loan has been assigned to the Trustee.

               (xl) Flood Hazard Insurance. None of the improvements on any
     related Mortgaged Property are located in a flood hazard area as defined by
     the Federal Insurance Administration or, if they are, the related Mortgagor
     has obtained flood hazard insurance.

               (xli) Engineering Assessments. Except as set forth on Schedule
     I-xli, one or more engineering assessments or updates of a previously
     conducted engineering assessment were performed by an Independent
     engineering consulting firm with respect to each related Mortgaged Property
     during the 12-month period preceding the Cut-off Date, and the Seller,
     having made no independent inquiry other than to review the report(s)
     prepared in connection with such assessment(s) and or update(s), does not
     have

<PAGE>

     any knowledge of any material and adverse engineering condition or
     circumstance affecting such Mortgaged Property that was not disclosed in
     such report(s); and, to the extent such assessments revealed deficiencies,
     deferred maintenance or similar conditions, either (A) the estimated cost
     has been escrowed or a letter of credit has been provided, (B) repairs have
     been made or (C) the scope of the deferred maintenance relative to the
     value of such Mortgaged Property was de minimis.

               (xlii) Escrows. All escrow deposits and payments relating to such
     Mortgage Loan are under control of the Seller or the servicer of such
     Mortgage Loan and all amounts required as of the date hereof under the
     related Mortgage Loan documents to be deposited by the related Mortgagor
     have been deposited. The Seller is transferring to the Trustee all of its
     right, title and interest in and to such amounts.

               (xliii) Licenses, Permits and Authorizations. Except as set forth
     on Schedule II-xlii, the related Mortgagor has represented in the related
     Mortgage Loan documents that, and to the actual knowledge of the Seller, as
     of the date of origination of such Mortgage Loan, all material licenses,
     permits and authorizations then required for use of the related Mortgaged
     Property by such Mortgagor, the related lessee, franchisor or operator have
     been issued and were valid and in full force and effect.

               (xliv) Origination, Servicing and Collection Practices. The
     origination, servicing and collection practices used by the Seller or any
     prior holder of the Mortgage Note have been in all respects legal and have
     met customary industry standards.

               (xlv) Fee Simple. Except as set forth on Schedule I-xlv, such
     Mortgage Loan is secured in whole or in material part by a fee simple
     interest.

               (xlvi) Leasehold Interest Only. If such Mortgage Loan is secured
     in whole or in material part by the interest of the related Mortgagor as a
     lessee under a Ground Lease but not by the related fee interest, then:

               (A)  such Ground Lease or a memorandum thereof has been or will
                    be duly recorded and such Ground Lease permits the interest
                    of the lessee thereunder to be encumbered by the related
                    Mortgage or, if consent of the lessor thereunder is
                    required, it has been obtained prior to the Closing Date;

               (B)  upon the foreclosure of such Mortgage Loan (or acceptance of
                    a deed in lieu thereof), the Mortgagor's interest in such
                    Ground Lease is assignable to the Trustee without the
                    consent of the lessor thereunder (or, if any such consent is
                    required, it has been obtained prior to the Closing Date)
                    and, in the event that it is so assigned, is further
                    assignable by the Trustee and its successors without a need
                    to obtain the consent of such lessor (or, if any such
                    consent is required, it has been obtained prior to the
                    Closing Date or may not be unreasonably withheld);

               (C)  such Ground Lease may not be amended or modified without the
<PAGE>

                    prior written consent of the mortgagee under such Mortgage
                    Loan and any such action without such consent is not binding
                    on such mortgagee, its successors or assigns;

               (D)  unless otherwise set forth in such Ground Lease, such Ground
                    Lease does not permit any increase in the amount of rent
                    payable by the ground lessee thereunder during the term of
                    such Mortgage Loan;

               (E)  such Ground Lease was in full force and effect as of the
                    date of origination of the related Mortgage Loan, and to the
                    actual knowledge of the Seller, at the Closing Date, such
                    Ground Lease is in full force and effect; to the actual
                    knowledge of the Seller, except for payments due but not yet
                    30 days or more delinquent, (1) there is no material default
                    under such Ground Lease, and (2) there is no event which,
                    with the passage of time or with notice and the expiration
                    of any grace or cure period, would constitute a material
                    default under such Ground Lease;

               (F)  such Ground Lease, or an estoppel or consent letter received
                    by the mortgagee under such Mortgage Loan from the lessor,
                    requires the lessor thereunder to give notice of any default
                    by the lessee to such mortgagee; and such Ground Lease, or
                    an estoppel or consent letter received by the mortgagee
                    under such Mortgage Loan from the lessor, further provides
                    either (1) that no notice of termination given under such
                    Ground Lease is effective against such mortgagee unless a
                    copy has been delivered to the mortgagee in the manner
                    described in such Ground Lease, estoppel or consent letter
                    or (2) that upon any termination of such Ground Lease the
                    lessor will enter into a new lease with such mortgagee upon
                    such mortgagee's request;

               (G)  based upon the related policy of title insurance, the ground
                    lessee's interest in such Ground Lease is not subject to any
                    liens or encumbrances superior to, or of equal priority
                    with, the related Mortgage, other than the related ground
                    lessor's related fee interest and any Permitted
                    Encumbrances;

               (H)  the mortgagee under such Mortgage Loan is permitted a
                    reasonable opportunity to cure any curable default under
                    such Ground Lease (not less than the time provided to the
                    related lessee under such ground lease to cure such default)
                    before the lessor thereunder may terminate or cancel such
                    Ground Lease;

               (I)  such Ground Lease has a currently effective term (exclusive
                    of any unexercised extension options set forth therein) that
                    extends not less than 20 years beyond the Stated Maturity
                    Date of the related
<PAGE>

                    Mortgage Loan;

               (J)  under the terms of such Ground Lease, any estoppel or
                    consent letter received by the mortgagee under such Mortgage
                    Loan from the lessor and the related Mortgage Loan
                    documents, taken together, any related insurance proceeds,
                    other than de minimis amounts for minor casualties, with
                    respect to the leasehold interest, or condemnation proceeds
                    will be applied either to the repair or restoration of all
                    or part of the related Mortgaged Property, with the
                    mortgagee or a trustee appointed by it having the right to
                    hold and disburse such proceeds as the repair or restoration
                    progresses (except in such cases where a provision entitling
                    another party to hold and disburse such proceeds would not
                    be viewed as commercially unreasonable by a prudent
                    commercial mortgage lender), or to the payment of the
                    outstanding principal balance of the Mortgage Loan, together
                    with any accrued interest thereon;

               (K)  such Ground Lease does not impose any restrictions on use or
                    subletting which would be viewed as commercially
                    unreasonable by a prudent commercial mortgage lender;

               (L)  upon the request of the mortgagee under such Mortgage Loan,
                    the ground lessor under such Ground Lease is required to
                    enter into a new lease upon termination of the Ground Lease
                    for any reason prior to the expiration of the term thereof,
                    including as a result of the rejection of the Ground Lease
                    in a bankruptcy of the related Mortgagor unless the
                    mortgagee under such Mortgage Loan fails to cure a default
                    of the lessee under such Ground Lease following notice
                    thereof from the lessor; and

               (M)  the terms of the related Ground Lease have not been waived,
                    modified, altered, satisfied, impaired, canceled,
                    subordinated or rescinded in any manner which materially
                    interferes with the security intended to be provided by such
                    Mortgage, except as set forth in an instrument or document
                    contained in the related Mortgage File.

               (xlvii) Fee Simple and Leasehold Interest. If such Mortgage Loan
     is secured in whole or in part by the interest of the related Mortgagor
     under a Ground Lease and by the related fee interest, then (A) such fee
     interest is subject, and subordinated of record, to the related Mortgage,
     (B) the related Mortgage does not by its terms provide that it will be
     subordinated to the lien of any other mortgage or other lien upon such fee
     interest, and (C) upon occurrence of a default under the terms of the
     related Mortgage by the related Mortgagor, the mortgagee under such
     Mortgage Loan has the right (subject to the limitations and exceptions set
     forth in paragraph (v) above) to foreclose upon or otherwise exercise its
     rights with respect to such fee interest.
<PAGE>

               (xlviii) Tax Lot; Utilities. Each related Mortgaged Property
     constitutes one or more complete separate tax lots (or the related
     Mortgagor has covenanted to obtain separate tax lots and an escrow of funds
     in an amount sufficient to pay taxes resulting from a breach thereof has
     been established) or is subject to an endorsement under the related title
     insurance policy; and each related Mortgaged Property is served by a public
     or other acceptable water system, a public sewer (or, alternatively, a
     septic) system, and other customary utility facilities.

               (xlix) Defeasance. Except as set forth on Schedule I-xlix, if
     such Mortgage Loan is a Defeasance Mortgage Loan, the related Mortgage Loan
     documents require the related Mortgagor to pay all reasonable costs
     associated with the defeasance thereof, and either: (A) require the prior
     written consent of, and compliance with the conditions set by, the holder
     of such Mortgage Loan for defeasance or (B) require that (1) defeasance may
     not occur prior to the second anniversary of the Closing Date, (2) the
     Defeasance Collateral must be government securities within the meaning of
     Treasury regulation section 1.860G-2(a)(8)(i) and must be sufficient to
     make all scheduled payments under the related Mortgage Note when due
     (assuming for each ARD Mortgage Loan that it matures on its Anticipated
     Repayment Date or on the date when any open prepayment period set forth in
     the related Mortgage Loan documents commences) or, in the case of a partial
     defeasance that effects the release of a material portion of the related
     Mortgaged Property, to make all scheduled payments under the related
     Mortgage Note on that part of such Mortgage Loan equal to at least 110% of
     the allocated loan amount of the portion of the Mortgaged Property being
     released, (3) an independent accounting firm (which may be the Mortgagor's
     independent accounting firm) certify that the Defeasance Collateral is
     sufficient to make such payments, (4) the Mortgage Loan be assumed by a
     successor entity designated by the holder of such Mortgage Loan, and (5)
     counsel provide an opinion letter to the effect that the Trustee has a
     perfected security interest in such Defeasance Collateral prior to any
     other claim or interest.

               (l) Primary Servicing Rights. No Person has been granted or
     conveyed the right to primary service such Mortgage Loan or receive any
     consideration in connection therewith except (A) as contemplated in this
     Agreement with respect to primary servicers that are to be sub-servicers of
     the Master Servicer, (B) as has been conveyed to Wachovia, in its capacity
     as a primary servicer, or (C) as has been terminated.

               (li) Mechanics' and Materialmen's Liens. To the Seller's
     knowledge, as of origination (A) the related Mortgaged Property is free and
     clear of any and all mechanics' and materialmen's liens that are not
     bonded, insured against or escrowed for, and (B) no rights are outstanding
     that under law could give rise to any such lien that would be prior or
     equal to the lien of the related Mortgage (unless affirmatively covered by
     the title insurance referred to in paragraph (xi) above (or an endorsement
     thereto)). The Seller has not received actual notice with respect to such
     Mortgage Loan that any mechanics' and materialmen's liens have encumbered
     such Mortgaged Property since origination that have not been released,
     bonded, insured against or escrowed for.
<PAGE>

               (lii) Due Date. The Due Date for such Mortgage Loan is scheduled
     to be the tenth day or the eleventh day of each month.

               (liii) Assignment of Leases. Subject only to Permitted
     Encumbrances, the related Assignment of Leases set forth in or separate
     from the related Mortgage and delivered in connection with such Mortgage
     Loan establishes and creates a valid and, subject only to the exceptions in
     paragraph (v) above, enforceable first priority lien and first priority
     security interest in the related Mortgagor's right to receive payments due
     under any and all leases, subleases, licenses or other agreements pursuant
     to which any Person is entitled to occupy, use or possess all or any
     portion of the related Mortgaged Property subject to the related Mortgage,
     except that a license may have been granted to the related Mortgagor to
     exercise certain rights and perform certain obligations of the lessor under
     the relevant lease or leases; and each assignor thereunder has the full
     right to assign the same.

               (liv) Mortgagor Formation or Incorporation. To the Seller's
     knowledge, the related Mortgagor is a Person formed or incorporated in a
     jurisdiction within the United States.

               (lv) No Ownership Interest in Mortgagor. The Seller has no
     ownership interest in the related Mortgaged Property or the related
     Mortgagor other than as the holder of such Mortgage Loan being sold and
     assigned, and neither the Seller nor any affiliate of the Seller has any
     obligation to make any capital contributions to the related Mortgagor under
     the Mortgage or any other related Mortgage Loan document.

               (lvi) No Undisclosed Common Ownership. Except as set forth on
     Schedule I-lvi, to the Seller's knowledge, no two properties securing
     Mortgage Loans are directly or indirectly under common ownership except to
     the extent that such common ownership has been specifically disclosed in
     the Mortgage Loan Schedule.

               (lvii) Mortgage Loan Outstanding. Such Mortgage Loan has not been
     satisfied in full, and except as expressly contemplated by the related loan
     agreement or other documents contained in the related Mortgage File, no
     material portion of the related Mortgaged Property has been released.

               (lviii) Usury. Such Mortgage Loan complied with or was exempt
     from all applicable usury laws in effect at its date of origination.

               (lix) ARD Mortgage Loan. If such Mortgage Loan is an ARD Mortgage
     Loan and has a Cut-off Date Balance of $15,000,000 or more, then:

               (A)  the related Anticipated Repayment Date is not less than five
                    years from the origination date for such Mortgage Loan;

               (B)  such Mortgage Loan provides that from the related
                    Anticipated Repayment Date through the maturity date for
                    such Mortgage Loan, all excess cash flow (net of normal
                    monthly debt service on such Mortgage Loan, monthly expenses
                    reasonably related to the
<PAGE>

                    operation of the related Mortgaged Property, amounts due for
                    reserves established under such Mortgage Loan, and payments
                    for any other expenses, including capital expenses, related
                    to such Mortgaged Property which are approved by mortgagee)
                    will be applied to repay principal due under such Mortgage
                    Loan; and

               (C)  no later than the related Anticipated Repayment Date, the
                    related Mortgagor is required (if it has not previously done
                    so) to enter into a "lockbox agreement" whereby all revenue
                    from the related Mortgaged Property will be deposited
                    directly into a designated account controlled by the
                    mortgagee under such Mortgage Loan.

               (lx) Appraisal. An appraisal of the related Mortgaged Property
     was conducted in connection with the origination of such Mortgage Loan; and
     such appraisal satisfied either (A) the requirements of the "Uniform
     Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice" as adopted by the Appraisal
     Standards Board of the Appraisal Foundation, or (B) the guidelines in Title
     XI of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of
     1989, in either case as in effect on the date such Mortgage Loan was
     originated.

<PAGE>



                  [LETTERHEAD OF CADWALADER, WICKERSHAM & TAFT]

                                        December 27, 2002

Addressees listed on Schedule A

Re:      Re:  LB-UBS Commercial Mortgage Trust 2002-C7,
         Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2002-C7

Ladies and Gentlemen:

                  We are rendering this opinion pursuant to Section 9(k) of the
Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement dated as of December 18, 2002 (the "MLPA"),
among UBS Warburg Real Estate Investments Inc., as seller (the "Seller"), UBS
Principal Finance LLC, as an additional party ("UBSPF") and Structured Asset
Securities Corporation II, as purchaser ("SASC").

                  We have acted as special counsel to the Seller in connection
with the following transactions: (i) the sale by the Seller, and the purchase by
SASC, of multifamily and commercial mortgage loans in the principal amount of
approximately $664,532,137 (the "UBS Mortgage Loans"), pursuant to the MLPA;
(ii) the execution by the Seller of the UBS Indemnification Agreement dated as
of December 18, 2002 (the "Indemnification Agreement"), by and among the Seller,
UBS (USA) Inc. ("UBS(USA)," and together with the Seller and UBSPF, the "UBS
Entities"), SASC and the Underwriters (as defined below); (iii) the execution by
the Seller of the UBS Supplementary Indemnification Agreement dated as of
December 18, 2002 (together with the Indemnification Agreement, the
"Indemnification Agreements"), by and among the Seller, UBS(USA), UBS Warburg
LLC ("UBSW"), Lehman Brothers Inc. ("Lehman"), Lehman Brothers Bank FSB, Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. and SASC; and (iv) the acknowledgement by the Seller of
certain sections of the Underwriting Agreement dated as of December 18, 2002
(the "Underwriting Agreement"), by and among SASC, Lehman and UBSW (the
"Underwriters") and acknowledged with respect to certain sections by the Seller
and Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.

                  We have also acted as special counsel to UBS(USA) in
connection with the execution by UBS(USA) of the Indemnification Agreements and
to UBSPF in connection with the execution by UBSPF of the MLPA.

                  The MLPA, the Indemnification Agreements and Underwriting
Agreement are collectively referred to herein as the "Agreements." Capitalized
terms not defined herein have the respective meanings set forth in the MLPA.

                  In rendering the opinions set forth below, we have examined
and, as to factual matters relevant to the opinions set forth below, relied upon
the originals, copies or specimens, certified or otherwise identified to our
satisfaction, of the Agreements and such certificates, corporate and public
records, agreements, instruments and other documents, including, among
<PAGE>

other things, the documents and agreements delivered at the closing of the
purchase and sale of the Certificates (the "Closing"), as we have deemed
appropriate as a basis for the opinions expressed below. In such examination we
have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all
documents, agreements and instruments submitted to us as originals, the
conformity to original documents, agreements and instruments of all documents,
agreements and instruments submitted to us as copies or specimens, the
authenticity of the originals of such documents, agreements and instruments
submitted to us as copies or specimens, and the accuracy of the factual matters
set forth in the documents, agreements and instruments we reviewed. As to any
facts material to the opinions expressed below that were not known to us, we
have relied upon statements, certificates and representations of officers and
other representatives of the UBS Entities, SASC and the Underwriters, including
those contained in the Agreements and other documents, certificates, agreements
and opinions delivered at the Closing, and of public officials. Except as
expressly set forth herein, we have not undertaken any independent investigation
(including, without limitation, conducting any review, search or investigation
of any public files, records or dockets) to determine the existence or absence
of the facts that are material to our opinion, and no inference as to our
knowledge concerning such facts should be drawn from our reliance on the
representations of the UBS Entities and others in connection with the
preparation and delivery of this letter. We have examined such questions of law
as we have deemed necessary for purposes of these opinions.

                  We have also assumed that all documents, agreements and
instruments have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by all parties
thereto, that all such parties had the power and legal right to execute and
deliver all such documents, agreements and instruments, and, except as to the
UBS Entities, that such documents, agreements and instruments are valid, binding
and enforceable obligations of such parties. As used herein, "to our knowledge,"
"known to us" or words of similar import mean the actual knowledge, without
independent investigation, of any lawyer in our firm actively involved in the
transactions contemplated by the Agreements.

                  We express no opinion concerning the laws of any jurisdiction
other than the laws of the State of New York and federal laws (without regard to
conflicts of laws principles) of the United States of America.

                  Based upon and subject to the foregoing, we are of the opinion
that:

                    1.   The MLPA and the Underwriting Agreement each
                         constitutes the legal, valid and binding agreement of
                         the Seller, and the MLPA constitutes the legal, valid
                         and binding agreement of UBSPF, enforceable against the
                         Seller or UBSPF, as applicable, in accordance with its
                         terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
                         fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium,
                         receivership or other laws relating to or affecting
                         creditors' rights generally, and to general principles
                         of equity (regardless of whether enforceability is
                         considered in a proceeding in equity or at law), and
                         except that the enforcement of rights with respect to
                         indemnification and contribution obligations and
                         provisions (a) purporting to waive or limit rights to
                         trial by jury, oral amendments to written agreements or
                         rights of
<PAGE>

                         set off or (b) relating to submission to jurisdiction,
                         venue or service of process, may be limited by
                         applicable law and considerations of public policy.

                    2.   None of the sale of the UBS Mortgage Loans, the
                         consummation by the Seller or UBSPF, as applicable, of
                         any of the other transactions contemplated by the

                         delivery and performance of the terms of the Agreements
                         to which it is a party by the Seller or UBSPF, as
                         applicable, will conflict with, or result in the
                         violation of, any New York State or federal law that is
                         applicable to the Seller or UBSPF, as applicable.

                    3.   The execution, delivery and performance of the terms of
                         the Indemnification Agreements by UBS(USA) will not
                         conflict with, or result in the violation of, any New
                         York State or federal law that is applicable to
                         UBS(USA).

                    4.   The execution, delivery and performance by (a) the
                         Seller of the Agreements, (b) UBSPF of the MLPA, and
                         (c) UBS(USA) of the Indemnification Agreements, and the
                         consummation by the Seller, UBSPF and UBS(USA), as
                         applicable, of the transactions contemplated under the
                         Agreements, the MLPA and the Indemnification
                         Agreements, respectively, do not require any consent,
                         approval, license, authorization or validation of, or
                         filing, recording or registration with, any executive,

                         those laws, rules and regulations of the United States
                         of America which, in our experience, are normally
                         applicable to transactions of the type contemplated by
                         (a) the Agreements, to be obtained on the part of the
                         Seller, (b) the MLPA, to be obtained by UBSPF and (c)

                 [FORM OF OPINION OF IN-HOUSE COUNSEL TO SELLER]

                                December 27, 2002

TO THE PERSONS ON
THE ATTACHED SCHEDULE A

Re:  LB-UBS Commercial Mortgage Trust 2002-C7, Commercial
     Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2002-C7

Ladies and Gentlemen:

                  I am Executive Director and Counsel of UBS AG. UBS Warburg
Real Estate Investments Inc., a Delaware corporation ("UBSREI"), is a wholly
owned subsidiary of UBS AG. I have been asked to deliver this opinion in
connection with (i) the sale by UBSREI and the purchase by Structured Asset
Securities Corporation II ("SASC") of certain multi-family and commercial
mortgage loans, pursuant to a Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement dated as of
December 18, 2002 (the "Sale Agreement"), by and among UBSREI, UBS Principal
Finance LLC and SASC, (ii) the execution by UBSREI of the Underwriting Agreement
dated as of December 18, 2002, (the "Underwriting Agreement"), by and among
SASC, Lehman Brothers Inc. ("Lehman") and UBS Warburg LLC ("UBSW" and, together
with Lehman, the "Underwriters") and acknowledged with respect to certain
sections by UBSREI, (iii) the execution by UBSREI of the UBS Indemnification
Agreement dated as of December 18, 2002, by and among UBSREI, SASC, UBS (USA)
Inc. ("UBS(USA)") and the Underwriters (the "Indemnification Agreement") and
(iv) the execution by UBSREI of the UBS Supplementary Indemnification Agreement
dated as of December [__], 2002 by and among UBSREI, SASC, UBS(USA), UBSW,
Lehman, Lehman Brothers Bank FSB and Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (the
"Supplementary Indemnification Agreement", and, together with the Sale
Agreement, the Underwriting Agreement and the Indemnification Agreement, the
"Agreements"). Capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined herein have the
meanings given to them in the Underwriting Agreement.

                  I, or others under my supervision, have examined such
documents as I believe are necessary or appropriate for the purposes of this
opinion, including the articles of incorporation, by-laws and incumbency
resolution adopted by the directors of UBSREI and the Agreements and all
exhibits thereto. In reaching such opinions, I have assumed without
investigation, except as expressly set forth below, that there are no facts
inconsistent with the assumptions made in paragraphs A through D below.

                  A. All signatures of parties, other than UBSREI, on all
documents are genuine. Each person executing any such instrument, document or
agreement, whether
<PAGE>

individually or on behalf of a firm or other business entity, other than UBSREI,
is duly authorized to do so.

                  B. All documents submitted as original are authentic, and all
photostatic copies, and all copies certified by a governmental custodian or a
party to the transaction, conform to authentic original documents.

                  C. All natural persons, including all persons acting on behalf
of a business entity, are legally competent.

                  D. All other parties to documents, other than UBSREI, have the
requisite power and authority to consummate the transactions contemplated by the
Agreements and to execute and deliver the applicable documents.

                  Based on my review of the foregoing and such other
considerations of law and fact as I believe to be relevant, and subject to the
limitations, assumptions and qualifications set forth herein, I am of the
opinion that:

                  1. Each of the Agreements has been duly authorized, executed
and delivered by UBSREI.

                  2. UBSREI is a corporation duly organized, validly existing
and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, and has the
requisite power and authority to enter into and perform its obligations under
the Agreements.

                  3. The execution, delivery and performance of the terms of the
Agreements will not result in the breach or violation of or a default under any
material order or decree of any court, regulatory body, administrative agency or
governmental body having jurisdiction over UBSREI and known to me as being
applicable to UBSREI.

                  4. There is no action, suit or proceeding against, or
investigation of, UBSREI pending or, to my knowledge, threatened against UBSREI
before any court, administrative agency or other tribunal which, either
individually or in the aggregate, (a) asserts the invalidity of the Agreements,
(b) seeks to prevent the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by
the Agreements or (c) would materially and adversely affect (i) the performance
by UBSREI of its obligations under, or the validity or enforceability of, the
Agreements, or (ii) any rights with regard to the Mortgaged Properties or the
Mortgage Loans.

                  5. No consent, approval, authorization or order of, and no
filing or registration with, any court or governmental agency or regulatory
body, of which I have actual knowledge, the absence of which would have a
material adverse effect on UBSREI or the transactions contemplated by the
Agreements, is required on the part of UBSREI for the execution, delivery or
performance by UBSREI of the Agreements, except those which have been obtained
and are in full force and effect.

                  6. The execution, delivery and performance by UBSREI of, and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by, the Agreements do not and
will not
<PAGE>

result in a breach of any term or provision of the organizational documents of
UBSREI or in a breach of, constitute a default under, require any consent under,
or result in the acceleration or require prepayment of any indebtedness pursuant
to the terms of, any agreement or instrument, of which I have actual knowledge,
to which UBSREI is a party or by which it is bound or to which it is subject, or
result in the creation or imposition of any lien upon any property of UBSREI
pursuant to the terms of any such agreement or instrument, any of which
occurrences, either in any one instance or in the aggregate, would call into
question the validity of the Agreements or be reasonably likely to impair
materially the ability of UBSREI to perform under the terms of the Agreements.

                  In addition to the qualifications set forth above, the
opinions herein are also subject to the following qualifications:

                  1. I am a member of the Bar of the State of New York, and the
opinions expressed herein concern only the laws of the State of New York, as
currently in effect, the corporation law of the State of Delaware, as currently
in effect, and solely with respect to paragraphs 3 and 4 above, the federal laws
of the United States of America, as currently in effect.

                  2. I assume no obligation to supplement this opinion if, after
the date hereof, any applicable laws change or I become aware of any facts that
might change the opinions set forth herein.

                  3. The opinions are limited to the matters set forth in this
letter. No other opinions should be inferred beyond the matters expressly
stated.

                  The opinions expressed in this letter may be relied upon
solely by the addressees hereof solely with respect to the transactions
described in the Agreements, and may not be relied upon by any other person or
entity, without my specific prior written consent.

TO THE PERSONS ON
THE ATTACHED SCHEDULE A

     Re:  LB-UBS Commercial Mortgage Trust 2002-C7, Commercial
          Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2002-C7

Ladies and Gentlemen:

                  I am Executive Director and Counsel of UBS AG. UBS Principal
Finance LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("UBSPF"), is a wholly owned
subsidiary of UBS AG. I have been asked to deliver this opinion in connection
with (i) the sale by UBS Warburg Real Estate Investments Inc. and the purchase
by Structured Asset Securities Corporation II ("SASC") of certain multi-family
and commercial mortgage loans, pursuant to a Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement
dated as of December 18, 2002 (the "Agreement"), by and among SASC, as
purchaser, UBS Warburg Real Estate Investments Inc., as seller, and UBSPF, as
additional party. Capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined herein have
the meanings given to them in the Agreement.

                  I, or others under my supervision, have examined such
documents as I believe are necessary or appropriate for the purposes of this
opinion, including the certificate of formation, incumbency resolution and
limited liability company agreement adopted by the members of UBSPF and the
Agreement and all exhibits thereto. In reaching such opinions, I have assumed
without investigation, except as expressly set forth below, that there are no
facts inconsistent with the assumptions made in paragraphs A through D below.

                  A. All signatures of parties, other than UBSPF, on all
documents are genuine. Each person executing any such instrument, document or
agreement, whether individually or on behalf of a firm or other business entity,
other than UBSPF, is duly authorized to do so.

                  B. All documents submitted as original are authentic, and all
photostatic copies, and all copies certified by a governmental custodian or a
party to the transaction, conform to authentic original documents.

                  C. All natural persons, including all persons acting on behalf
of a business entity, are legally competent.
<PAGE>

                  D. All other parties to documents, other than UBSPF, have the
requisite power and authority to consummate the transactions contemplated by the
Agreement and to execute and deliver the applicable documents.

                  Based on my review of the foregoing and such other
considerations of law and fact as I believe to be relevant, and subject to the
limitations, assumptions and qualifications set forth herein, I am of the
opinion that:

                  1. The Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and
delivered by UBSPF.

                  2. UBSPF is a limited liability company duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware,
and has the requisite power and authority to enter into and perform its
obligations under the Agreement.

                  3. The execution, delivery and performance of the terms of the
Agreement will not result in the breach or violation of or a default under any
material order or decree of any court, regulatory body, administrative agency or
governmental body having jurisdiction over UBSPF and known to me as being
applicable to UBSPF.

                  4. There is no action, suit or proceeding against, or
investigation of, UBSPF pending or, to my knowledge, threatened against UBSPF
before any court, administrative agency or other tribunal which, either
individually or in the aggregate, (a) asserts the invalidity of the Agreement,
(b) seeks to prevent the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by
the Agreement or (c) would materially and adversely affect (i) the performance
by UBSPF of its obligations under, or the validity or enforceability of, the
Agreement, or (ii) any rights with regard to the Mortgaged Properties or the
Mortgage Loans.

                  5. No consent, approval, authorization or order of, and no
filing or registration with, any court or governmental agency or regulatory
body, of which I have actual knowledge, the absence of which would have a
material adverse effect on UBSPF or the transactions contemplated by the
Agreement, is required on the part of UBSPF for the execution, delivery or
performance by UBSPF of the Agreement, except those which have been obtained and
are in full force and effect.

                  6. The execution, delivery and performance by UBSPF of, and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by, the Agreement do not and
will not result in a breach of any term or provision of the certificate of
formation or limited liability company agreement of UBSPF or in a breach of,
constitute a default under, require any consent under, or result in the
acceleration or require prepayment of any indebtedness pursuant to the terms of,
any agreement or instrument, of which I have actual knowledge, to which UBSPF is
a party or by which it is bound or to which it is subject, or result in the
creation or imposition of any lien upon any property of UBSPF pursuant to the
terms of any such agreement or instrument, any of which occurrences, either in
any one instance or in the aggregate, would call into question the validity of
the


<PAGE>

Agreement or be reasonably likely to impair materially the ability of UBSPF to
perform under the terms of the Agreement.

                  In addition to the qualifications set forth above, the
opinions herein are also subject to the following qualifications:

                  1. I am a member of the Bar of the State of New York, and the

currently in effect, the limited liability company law of the State of Delaware,
as currently in effect, and solely with respect to paragraphs 3 and 4 above, the

the date hereof, any applicable laws change or I become aware of any facts that
might change the opinions set forth herein.

TO THE PERSONS ON
THE ATTACHED SCHEDULE A

     RE:  LB-UBS Commercial Mortgage Trust 2002-C7, Commercial Mortgage
          Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2002-C7

Ladies and Gentlemen:

                  I am Executive Director and Counsel of UBS AG. UBS (USA) Inc.,
a Delaware corporation ("UBS(USA)"), is a wholly owned subsidiary of UBS AG, and
I have acted as counsel to UBS(USA) with respect to certain matters in
connection with (i) the UBS Indemnification Agreement dated as of December 18,
2002 (the "Indemnification Agreement") by and among UBS Warburg Real Estate
Investments Inc. ("UBSREI"), UBS(USA), Structured Asset Securities Corporation
II ("Depositor"), Lehman Brothers Inc. ("Lehman") and UBS Warburg LLC ("UBSW"
and, together with Lehman, the "Underwriters") and (ii) the UBS Supplementary
Indemnification Agreement dated as of December 18, 2002 (together with the
Indemnification Agreement, the "Indemnification Agreements"), by and among
UBS(USA), UBSREI, UBSW, Lehman, Lehman Brothers Bank FSB, Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. and Depositor. Capitalized terms not defined herein have the
meaning assigned to them in the Indemnification Agreement.

                  I, or others under my supervision, have examined such
documents as I believe are necessary or appropriate for the purposes of this
opinion, including the certificate of incorporation and by-laws adopted by the
board of directors of UBS(USA) and the Indemnification Agreements and all
exhibits thereto. In reaching such opinions, I have assumed without
investigation, except as expressly set forth below, that there are no facts
inconsistent with the assumptions made in paragraphs A through D below.

                  A. All signatures of parties, other than UBS(USA), on all
documents are genuine. Each person executing any such instrument, document or
agreement, whether individually or on behalf of a firm or other business entity,
other than UBS(USA), is duly authorized to do so.

                  B. All documents submitted as original are authentic, and all
photostatic copies, and all copies certified by a governmental custodian or a
party to the transaction, conform to authentic original documents.

                  C. All natural persons, including all persons acting on behalf
of a business entity, are legally competent.
<PAGE>

                  D. All other parties to documents, other than UBS(USA), have
the requisite power and authority to consummate the transactions contemplated by
the Indemnification Agreements and to execute and deliver the applicable
documents.

                  Based on my review of the foregoing and such other
considerations of law and fact as I believe to be relevant, and subject to the
limitations, assumptions and qualifications set forth herein, I am of the
opinion that:

                  1. The Indemnification Agreements have been duly authorized,
executed and delivered by UBS(USA).

                  2. UBS(USA) is a corporation duly organized, validly existing
and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, and has the
requisite power and authority to enter into and perform its obligations under
the Indemnification Agreements.

                  3. The execution, delivery and performance of the terms of the
Indemnification Agreements will not result in the breach or violation of or a
default under any material order or decree of any court, regulatory body,
administrative agency or governmental body having jurisdiction over UBS(USA) and
known to me as being applicable to UBS(USA).

                  4. There is no action, suit or proceeding against, or
investigation of, UBS(USA) pending or, to my knowledge, threatened against
UBS(USA) before any court, administrative agency or other tribunal which, either
individually or in the aggregate, (a) asserts the invalidity of the
Indemnification Agreements, (b) seeks to prevent the consummation of any of the
transactions contemplated by the Indemnification Agreements or (c) would
materially and adversely affect the performance by UBS(USA) of its obligations
under, or the validity or enforceability of, the Indemnification Agreements.

                  5. No consent, approval, authorization or order of, and no
filing or registration with, any court or governmental agency or regulatory
body, of which I have actual knowledge, the absence of which would have a
material adverse effect on UBS(USA) or the transactions contemplated by the
Indemnification Agreements, is required on the part of UBS(USA) for the
execution, delivery or performance by UBS(USA) of the Indemnification
Agreements, except those which have been obtained and are in full force and
effect.

                  6. The execution, delivery and performance by UBS(USA) of, and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by, the Indemnification
Agreements do not and will not result in the breach of any term or provision of
the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of UBS(USA) or in a breach of,
constitute a default under, require any consent under, or result in the
acceleration or require prepayment of any indebtedness pursuant to the terms of,
any agreement or instrument of which I have actual knowledge to which UBS(USA)
is a party or by which it is bound or to which it is subject, or result in the
creation or imposition of any lien upon any property of UBS(USA) pursuant to the
terms of any such agreement or instrument, any of which occurrences, either in
any one instance or in the aggregate, would call into question the validity of
the Indemnification Agreements or be reasonably likely to impair materially the
ability of UBS(USA) to perform under the terms of the Indemnification
Agreements.
