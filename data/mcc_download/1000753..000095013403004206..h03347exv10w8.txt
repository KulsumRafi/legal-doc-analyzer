         adjustments as provided in Paragraph 6, the maximum number of
         shares of Common Stock with respect to Option Rights that may
         be granted under this Plan is equal to the number of shares
         authorized by the Board for such grants; however, any shares
         of Common Stock which are subject to Option Rights that are
         terminated unexercised, forfeited or surrendered or which
         expire for any reason will again be available for issuance.
         Such shares may be shares of original issuance or treasury
         shares or a combination of the foregoing."

         Except as modified herein, the Plan shall remain in full force
and effect.
