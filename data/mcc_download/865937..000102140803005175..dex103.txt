                       SECOND AMENDMENT TO LOAN AGREEMENT


         THIS SECOND AMENDMENT TO LOAN AGREEMENT (this "Amendment"), dated as of
February 8, 2001, is entered into by and among:

               (1) CATELLUS FINANCE 1, L.L.C., a Delaware limited liability
         company ("Borrower"); and

               (2) LASALLE BANK NATIONAL ASSOCIATION, f/k/a LaSalle National
         Bank, as trustee for the registered Holders of Prudential Mortgage
         Capital Company I, LLC, Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates,
         Series 1998-1 ("Lender").

                                    RECITALS

         A.    Reference is made to that certain loan agreement dated as of
October 26, 1998 between Borrower and Prudential Mortgage Capital Company, Inc.,
a Delaware corporation ("Prudential"), predecessor-in-interest to Lender, as
amended by that certain First Amendment to Loan Agreement dated as of January
11, 2001 (as the same may hereinafter be consolidated, extended, modified,
amended and/or restated or renewed from time to time, the "Loan Agreement").
Pursuant to the terms of the Loan Agreement, Prudential agreed to extend a loan
(the "Loan"), evidenced by that certain promissory note dated October 26, 1998,
in the original principal amount of THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY-THREE MILLION AND
00/100 DOLLARS ($373,000,000.00).

         B.    Prudential assigned all of its right, title and interest under
the Loan to Prudential Mortgage Capital Company I, LLC, which in turn assigned
all of its right, title and interest under the Loan to Lender in accordance with
the terms and provisions of that certain Trust and Servicing Agreement dated as
of November 11, 1998, by and among Prudential Mortgage Capital Company I, LLC,
as Depositor, The Prudential Insurance Company of America, as Servicer (the
"Servicer"), ABN AMRO Bank N.V., as Fiscal Agent, and LaSalle National Bank, as
Trustee (the "Trust and Servicing Agreement").

         C.    In connection with the closing of the Loan, Borrower pledged to
Prudential as collateral for the Loan, among other things, certain Properties
identified in Exhibit A of the Loan Agreement as follows: (1) CA0710625, 505
West 2nd Street, San Bernardino, California; (2) CA0370051, 240 South Arroyo
Parkway, Pasadena, California; (3) CA0591434, 1915 South Grand Avenue, Santa
Ana, California; and (4) CA0010251, 1300-1310 University Avenue, Berkeley,
California (the foregoing four properties are more specifically described in
Exhibit A attached hereto and are collectively referred to herein as the
"Proposed Replaced Properties"); and (b) certain "Expansion Land" comprising a
portion of the Property identified as CA0010612, Automall Parkway, Fremont,
California in Exhibit A to the Loan Agreement (the "Automall Property"); (such
Expansion Land, consisting of approximately 3.87 acres of land, is hereinafter
referred to as the "Office Depot Expansion Land").

         D.    By exercise of an option contained in the lease affecting the
Office Depot Expansion Land, the tenant under such lease has caused Borrower to
construct on the Office

<PAGE>

Depot Expansion Land certain "Expansion Improvements" (the Office Depot
Expansion Land and such Expansion Improvements are collectively referred to
herein as the "Office Depot Expansion Premises").

         E.    In accordance with Section 2.15 of the Loan Agreement, Borrower
has requested to have the Office Depot Expansion Premises considered as a
Substitute Property and to have the Proposed Replaced Properties released from
the Property Pool as if such Properties were Replaced Properties, and to amend
the Loan Agreement, the applicable mortgage(s) and the other Loan Documents
accordingly.

         F.    Lender has agreed to such request and is willing to amend the
Loan Agreement, the applicable mortgage and the other Loan Documents upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein.

                                    AGREEMENT

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the above recitals and for other
good and valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby
acknowledged, Borrower and Lender hereby agree as follows:

         1.    Definitions, Interpretation. All capitalized terms defined above
and elsewhere in this Amendment shall be used herein as so defined. Unless
otherwise defined herein, all other capitalized terms used herein shall have the
respective meanings given to those terms in the Loan Agreement, as amended by
this Amendment.

         2.    Amendments to Loan Agreement. Subject to the satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in Section 5 below and the applicable conditions set forth
in Sections 2.12 and 2.15 of the Loan Agreement, the Office Depot Expansion
Premises shall constitute a Substitute Property and the Proposed Replaced
Properties are released from the Property Pool as Replaced Properties. In
furtherance thereof: (a) Exhibit A of the Loan Agreement is hereby amended by
deleting therefrom the Proposed Replaced Properties, and (b) Schedule 1 of the
Loan Agreement is hereby amended by deleting therefrom the Proposed Replaced
Properties (including all information relating thereto) and replacing the row of
information corresponding to the Automall Property with a new row of information
as follows:

               PN#                 18 CA 0010612
               Property            Automall Parkway
                                   Fremont
                                   CA
               Property Type       Industrial
               SF                  449,501
               Fair Market Value   29,855,000
               NOI                 2,553,201
               Allocated Loan      21,750,000

                                        2

<PAGE>

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the release of the Proposed Replaced Properties
shall not constitute a release of Borrower's indemnification obligations under
the Loan Agreement or under the other Loan Documents as to any matters or claims
which occurred or relate to any matters or claims which occurred on or before
the Effective Date (as defined below) with respect to the Proposed Replaced
Properties and such obligations shall survive the release of the Proposed
Replaced Properties from the Property Pool.

         3.    Representations and Warranties of Borrower. Borrower hereby
represents and warrants to Lender that the following are true and correct on the
date of this Amendment and that, after giving effect to the amendment set forth
in Paragraph 2 above, the following will be true and correct on the Effective
Date (as defined below):

               (a)  The representations and warranties of Borrower set forth
         in the Loan Agreement, including, without limitation, Article V thereof
         and in the other Loan Documents are true and correct in all material
         respects as if made on such date (except for representations and
         warranties expressly made as of a specified date, which shall be true
         as of such date);

               (b)  The Borrower has not previously undertaken a Substitution
         on six (6) occasions;

               (c)  No Default or Event of Default has occurred and is
         continuing; and

               (d)  There are no existing rights, conditions or options to
         expand onto, to lease, or to purchase, all or any portion of the
         Proposed Replaced Properties held by any tenant of the Properties which
         shall remain in the Property Pool following the consummation of the
         Substitution contemplated herein (collectively, the "Continuing
         Property"). All options, rights of first refusal or any other right to
         lease or purchase all or any portion of the Proposed Replaced
         Properties, if any, held by any past or present tenant or any other
         person with an interest in the Proposed Replaced Properties have either
         been terminated, waived or expired, such that the Proposed Replaced
         Properties can be released from the Property Pool without any resulting
         adverse consequences to Lender.

(Without limiting the scope of the term "Loan Documents," Borrower expressly
acknowledges in making the representations and warranties set forth in this
Paragraph 3 that, on and after the date hereof, such term includes this
Amendment.)

         4.    Effective Date. The amendments effected by Paragraph 2 above
shall become effective (the "Effective Date") upon satisfaction and receipt by
Lender of the following matters, each in form and substance satisfactory to

         of reference only and are not part of the substance hereof.

               (c)  Governing Law. This Amendment shall be governed by and

Fremont, California (Office Depot) in Exhibit A to the Loan Agreement (such
expansion land referred to herein as the "Office Depot Expansion Premises") to
be considered a Substitute Property, and has designated the following properties

documents: CA0710625, 505 West 2nd Street, San Bernardino, California;

Assignment of Leases to release the property identified as CA0010251, 1300
University Avenue, Berkeley, California, from the lien of the Alameda Assignment
of Leases.

<PAGE>

                                    AGREEMENT

the Alameda Assignment of Leases shall remain encumbered by the Alameda
Assignment of Leases in accordance with the terms thereof.

         3. Effect of this Amendment. On and after the date this Amendment is
recorded in the Official Records of Alameda County, California, each reference
in the Loan Agreement to the Assignment of Leases and Rents encumbering the
property identified as CA0010251, 1300 University Avenue, Berkeley, California,
shall mean such Assignment of Leases and Rents as amended hereby. Except as
specifically amended above, (a) the Loan Agreement, the Alameda Assignment of
Leases and the other Loan Documents shall remain in full force and effect and

                  (a) Counterparts. This Amendment may be executed in any number
         of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of

         thereof by all of the parties hereto without affecting the validity

            SECOND AMENDMENT TO, SUBSTITUTION OF TRUSTEE, AND PARTIAL
           RELEASE OF DEED OF TRUST, ASSIGNMENT OF LEASES AND RENTS,
                     SECURITY AGREEMENT AND FIXTURE FILING

     THIS SECOND AMENDMENT TO, SUBSTITUTION OF TRUSTEE, AND PARTIAL RELEASE OF
DEED OF TRUST, ASSIGNMENT OF LEASES AND RENTS, SECURITY AGREEMENT AND FIXTURE
FILING (this "Amendment"), dated as of February 8, 2001, is entered into by and
between CATELLUS FINANCE 1, L.L.C., a Delaware limited liability company
("Trustor"), having an address at 201 Mission Street, Suite 340, San Francisco,
California 94105, and by LASALLE BANK NATIONAL ASSOCIATION, f/k/a LaSalle

Capital Company I, LLC, Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series
1998-1 ("Beneficiary"), having an address at 135 South LaSalle Street, Suite

                                    RECITALS

          A.   Reference is made to that certain loan agreement dated as of
October 26, 1998 between Trustor and PRUDENTIAL MORTGAGE CAPITAL COMPANY, INC.,
a Delaware corporation ("Prudential"), predecessor-in-interest to Beneficiary
(as the same may hereinafter be consolidated, extended, modified, amended and/or
restated or renewed from time to time, the "Loan Agreement"). Pursuant to the
terms of the Loan Agreement, Prudential agreed to extend a loan (the "Loan"),
evidenced by that certain promissory note dated October 26, 1998, in the
original principal amount of THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY-THREE MILLION AND 00/100
DOLLARS ($373,000,000.00), and secured by, among other things, that certain Deed
of Trust, Assignment of Leases and Rents, Security Agreement and Fixture Filing
dated as of October 26, 1998, and recorded on October 28, 1998 as Document
19980458192 in the Official Records of San Bernardino County, California (as
subsequently assigned and amended, the "San Bernardino Deed of Trust").

          B.   As described in Section 2.15(a) of the Loan Agreement, Trustor
has the option to substitute certain Expansion Premises in place of certain
other properties designated by Trustor (the "Replaced Properties") and to have
such Replaced Properties released from the Property Pool securing the Loan.

          C.   Trustor has now elected to have the expansion land comprising a
portion of the Property identified as CA0010612, AutoMall Parkway, Fremont,
California (Office Depot) in Exhibit A to the Loan Agreement (such expansion
land referred to herein as the "Office Depot Expansion Premises") to be
considered a Substitute Property, and has designated the following properties as
Replaced Properties and to be released from the applicable security documents:
CA0710625, 505 West 2nd Street, San Bernardino, California; CA0370051, 240 South
Arroyo Parkway, Pasadena, California; CA0591434, 1915 South Grand Avenue, Santa
Ana, California; and CA0010251, 1300 University Avenue, Berkeley, California.

          D.   Beneficiary and Trustor now desire to amend the San Bernardino
Deed of Trust to release the property identified as CA0710625, 505 West 2nd
Street, San Bernardino, California, from the lien of the San Bernardino Deed of
Trust.

<PAGE>

                                    AGREEMENT

     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the above recitals and for other good
and valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby
acknowledged, Beneficiary and Trustor hereby agree as follows:

     1.   Definitions. All capitalized terms defined above and elsewhere in this
Amendment shall be used herein as so defined. Unless otherwise defined herein,
all other capitalized terms used herein shall have the respective meanings given
to those terms in the Loan Agreement.

     2.   Substitution of Trustee and Partial Release of Property under San
Bernardino Deed of Trust. Beneficiary hereby substitutes itself as trustee under
the San Bernardino Deed of Trust in place of First American Title Insurance
Company and hereby releases and discharges from the lien of the San Bernardino
Deed of Trust that portion, and only that portion, of the real property and
improvements encumbered by the San Bernardino Deed of Trust which is more
particularly described on Exhibit A attached hereto and made a part hereof (the
"Release Parcel"). All other "Property" described in and currently encumbered by
the San Bernardino Deed of Trust shall remain encumbered by the San Bernardino
Deed of Trust in accordance with the terms thereof.

     3.   Effect of this Amendment. On and after the date this Amendment is
recorded in the Official Records of San Bernardino County, California, each
reference in the Loan Agreement to the Deed of Trust encumbering the Release
Parcel shall mean such Deed of Trust as amended hereby. Except as specifically
amended above, (a) the Loan Agreement, the San Bernardino Deed of Trust and the
other Loan Documents shall remain in full force and effect and are hereby
ratified and affirmed and (b) the execution, delivery and effectiveness of this
Amendment shall not, except as expressly provided herein, operate as a waiver of
any right, power, or remedy of Beneficiary, nor constitute a waiver of any
provision of the Loan Agreement, the San Bernardino Deed of Trust or any other
Loan Document.

     4.   Miscellaneous.

          (a)  Counterparts. This Amendment may be executed in any number of
     counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which
     taken together shall constitute one and the same instrument. The signature
     page and acknowledgment of any counterpart may be removed therefrom and
     attached to any other counterpart to evidence execution thereof by all of
     the parties hereto without affecting the validity thereof.

          (b)  Headings. Headings in this Amendment are for convenience of
     reference only and are not part of the substance hereof.

          (c)  Governing Law. This Amendment shall be governed by and construed
     in accordance with the laws of the State of New York and the laws of the
     State of California as provided in the San Bernardino Deed of Trust.

                          [The signature page follows]

          A.   Reference is made to that certain loan agreement dated as of

a Delaware corporation ("Prudential"), predecessor-in-interest to Assignee (as
the same may hereinafter be consolidated, extended, modified, amended and/or
restated or renewed from time to time, the "Loan Agreement"). Pursuant to the
terms of the Loan Agreement, Prudential agreed to extend a loan (the "Loan"),
evidenced by that certain promissory note dated October 26, 1998, in the
original principal amount of THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY-THREE MILLION AND 00/100
DOLLARS ($373,000,000.00), and secured by, among other things, that certain

          B.   As described in Section 2.15(a) of the Loan Agreement, Assignor
has the option to substitute certain Expansion Premises in place of certain
other properties designated by Assignor (the "Replaced Properties") and to have

          C.   Assignor has now elected to have the expansion land comprising a
portion of the Property identified as CA0010612, AutoMall Parkway, Fremont,
California (Office Depot) in Exhibit A to the Loan Agreement (such expansion
land referred to herein as the "Office Depot Expansion Premises") to be
considered a Substitute Property, and has designated the following properties as
Replaced Properties and to be released from the applicable security documents:
CA0710625, 505 West 2nd Street, San Bernardino, California; CA0370051, 240 South
Arroyo Parkway, Pasadena, California; CA0591434, 1915 South Grand Avenue, Santa

Assignment of Leases to release the property identified as CA0710625, 505 West
2nd Street, San Bernardino, California from the lien of the San Bernardino
Assignment of Leases.

                                    AGREEMENT

<PAGE>

     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the above recitals and for other good
and valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby
acknowledged, Assignee and Assignor hereby agree as follows:

     1.   Definitions. All capitalized terms defined above and elsewhere in this
Amendment shall be used herein as so defined. Unless otherwise defined herein,
all other capitalized terms used herein shall have the respective meanings given
to those terms in the Loan Agreement.

     2.   Partial Release of Property under San Bernardino Assignment of Leases.
Assignee hereby releases and discharges from the lien of the San Bernardino
Assignment of Leases that portion, and only that portion, of the real property
and improvements encumbered by the San Bernardino Assignment of Leases which is
more particularly described on Exhibit A attached hereto and made a part hereof
(the "Release Parcel"). All other "Property" described in and currently
encumbered by the San Bernardino Assignment of Leases shall remain encumbered by
the San Bernardino Assignment of Leases in accordance with the terms thereof.

     3.   Effect of this Amendment. On and after the date this Amendment is
recorded in the Official Records of San Bernardino County, California, each
reference in the Loan Agreement to the Assignment of Leases and Rents
encumbering the property identified as CA0710625, 505 West 2nd Street, San
Bernardino, California, shall mean such Assignment of Leases and Rents as
amended hereby. Except as specifically amended above, (a) the Loan Agreement,
the San Bernardino Assignment of Leases and the other Loan Documents shall
remain in full force and effect and are hereby ratified and affirmed and (b) the
execution, delivery and effectiveness of this Amendment shall not, except as
expressly provided herein, operate as a waiver of any right, power, or remedy of
Assignee, nor constitute a waiver of any provision of the Loan Agreement, the
San Bernardino Assignment of Leases or any other Loan Document.

     4.   Miscellaneous.

          (a)  Counterparts. This Amendment may be executed in any number of
     counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which
     taken together shall constitute one and the same instrument. The signature
     page and acknowledgment of any counterpart may be removed therefrom and
     attached to any other counterpart to evidence execution thereof by all of
     the parties hereto without affecting the validity thereof.

          (b)  Headings. Headings in this Amendment are for convenience of
     reference only and are not part of the substance hereof.

          (c)  Governing Law. This Amendment shall be governed by and construed
     in accordance with the laws of the State of New York and the laws of the
     State of California as provided in the San Bernardino Assignment of Leases.

        FIRST AMENDMENT TO, SUBSTITUTION OF TRUSTEE, AND PARTIAL RELEASE
           OF DEED OF TRUST, ASSIGNMENT OF LEASES AND RENTS, SECURITY
                          AGREEMENT AND FIXTURE FILING

     THIS FIRST AMENDMENT TO, SUBSTITUTION OF TRUSTEE, AND PARTIAL RELEASE OF
DEED OF TRUST, ASSIGNMENT OF LEASES AND RENTS, SECURITY AGREEMENT AND FIXTURE
FILING (this "Amendment"), dated as of February 8, 2001, is entered into by and
between CATELLUS FINANCE 1, L.L.C., a Delaware limited liability company
("Trustor"), having an address at 201 Mission Street, Suite 340, San Francisco,
California 94105, and by LASALLE BANK NATIONAL ASSOCIATION, f/k/a LaSalle

Capital Company I, LLC, Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series
1998-1 ("Beneficiary"), having an address at 135 South LaSalle Street, Suite

                                    RECITALS

          A.   Reference is made to that certain loan agreement dated as of
October 26, 1998 between Trustor and PRUDENTIAL MORTGAGE CAPITAL COMPANY, INC.,
a Delaware corporation ("Prudential"), predecessor-in-interest to Beneficiary
(as the same may hereinafter be consolidated, extended, modified, amended and/or
restated or renewed from time to time, the "Loan Agreement"). Pursuant to the
terms of the Loan Agreement, Prudential agreed to extend a loan (the "Loan"),
evidenced by that certain promissory note dated October 26, 1998, in the
original principal amount of THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY-THREE MILLION AND 00/100
DOLLARS ($373,000,000.00), and secured by, among other things, that certain Deed
of Trust, Assignment of Leases and Rents, Security Agreement and Fixture Filing
dated as of October 26, 1998, and recorded on October 27, 1998 as Document
19980726609 in the Official Records of Orange County, California (as
subsequently assigned and amended, the "Orange Deed of Trust").

          B.   As described in Section 2.15(a) of the Loan Agreement, Trustor
has the option to substitute certain Expansion Premises in place of certain
other properties designated by Trustor (the "Replaced Properties") and to have
such Replaced Properties released from the Property Pool securing the Loan.

          C.   Trustor has now elected to have the expansion land comprising a
portion of the Property identified as CA0010612, AutoMall Parkway, Fremont,
California (Office Depot) in Exhibit A to the Loan Agreement (such expansion
land referred to herein as the "Office Depot Expansion Premises") to be
considered a Substitute Property, and has designated the following properties as
Replaced Properties and to be released from the applicable security documents:
CA0710625, 505 West 2nd Street, San Bernardino, California; CA0370051, 240 South
Arroyo Parkway, Pasadena, California; CA0591434, 1915 South Grand Avenue, Santa
Ana, California; and CA0010251, 1300 University Avenue, Berkeley, California.

          D.   Beneficiary and Trustor now desire to amend the Orange Deed of
Trust to release the property identified as CA0591434, 1915 South Grand Avenue,
Santa Ana, California, from the lien of the Orange Deed of Trust.

<PAGE>

                                    AGREEMENT

     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the above recitals and for other good
and valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby
acknowledged, Beneficiary and Trustor hereby agree as follows:

     1.   Definitions. All capitalized terms defined above and elsewhere in this
Amendment shall be used herein as so defined. Unless otherwise defined herein,
all other capitalized terms used herein shall have the respective meanings given
to those terms in the Loan Agreement.

     2.   Substitution of Trustee and Partial Release of Property under Orange
Deed of Trust. Beneficiary hereby substitutes itself as trustee under the Orange
Deed of Trust in place of First American Title Insurance Company and hereby
releases and discharges from the lien of the Orange Deed of Trust that portion,
and only that portion, of the real property and improvements encumbered by the
Orange Deed of Trust which is more particularly described on Exhibit A attached
hereto and made a part hereof (the "Release Parcel"). All other "Property"
described in and currently encumbered by the Orange Deed of Trust shall remain
encumbered by the Orange Deed of Trust in accordance with the terms thereof.

     3.   Effect of this Amendment. On and after the date this Amendment is
recorded in the Official Records of Orange County, California, each reference in
the Loan Agreement to the Deed of Trust encumbering the Release Parcel shall
mean such Deed of Trust as amended hereby. Except as specifically amended above,
(a) the Loan Agreement, the Orange Deed of Trust and the other Loan Documents
shall remain in full force and effect and are hereby ratified and affirmed and
(b) the execution, delivery and effectiveness of this Amendment shall not,
except as expressly provided herein, operate as a waiver of any right, power, or
remedy of Beneficiary, nor constitute a waiver of any provision of the Loan
Agreement, the Orange Deed of Trust or any other Loan Document.

     4.   Miscellaneous.

          (a)  Counterparts. This Amendment may be executed in any number of
     counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which
     taken together shall constitute one and the same instrument. The signature
     page and acknowledgment of any counterpart may be removed therefrom and
     attached to any other counterpart to evidence execution thereof by all of
     the parties hereto without affecting the validity thereof.

          (b)  Headings. Headings in this Amendment are for convenience of
     reference only and are not part of the substance hereof.

          (c)  Governing Law. This Amendment shall be governed by and construed
     in accordance with the laws of the State of New York and the laws of the
     State of California as provided in the Orange Deed of Trust.

                          [The signature page follows]

                    FIRST AMENDMENT TO AND PARTIAL RELEASE OF
                         ASSIGNMENT OF LEASES AND RENTS

     THIS FIRST AMENDMENT TO AND PARTIAL RELEASE OF ASSIGNMENT OF LEASES AND
RENTS (this "Amendment"), dated as of February 8, 2001, is entered into by and
between CATELLUS FINANCE 1, L.L.C., a Delaware limited liability company
("Assignor"), having an address at 201 Mission Street, Suite 340, San Francisco,
California 94105, and by LASALLE BANK NATIONAL ASSOCIATION, f/k/a LaSalle

Capital Company I, LLC, Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series
1998-1 ("Assignee"), having an address at 135 South LaSalle Street, Suite 1625,
Chicago, Illinois 60647-4107.

                                    RECITALS

          A.   Reference is made to that certain loan agreement dated as of
October 26, 1998 between Assignor and PRUDENTIAL MORTGAGE CAPITAL COMPANY, INC.,
a Delaware corporation ("Prudential"), predecessor-in-interest to Assignee (as
the same may hereinafter be consolidated, extended, modified, amended and/or
restated or renewed from time to time, the "Loan Agreement"). Pursuant to the
terms of the Loan Agreement, Prudential agreed to extend a loan (the "Loan"),
evidenced by that certain promissory note dated October 26, 1998, in the
original principal amount of THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY-THREE MILLION AND 00/100
DOLLARS ($373,000,000.00), and secured by, among other things, that certain
Assignment of Leases and Rents dated as of October 26, 1998, and recorded on
October 27, 1998 as Document 19980726611 in the Official Records of Orange
County, California (as subsequently assigned and amended, the "Orange Assignment
of Leases").

          B.   As described in Section 2.15(a) of the Loan Agreement, Assignor
has the option to substitute certain Expansion Premises in place of certain
other properties designated by Assignor (the "Replaced Properties") and to have
such Replaced Properties released from the Property Pool securing the Loan.

          C.   Assignor has now elected to have the expansion land comprising a
portion of the Property identified as CA0010612, AutoMall Parkway, Fremont,
California (Office Depot) in Exhibit A to the Loan Agreement (such expansion
land referred to herein as the "Office Depot Expansion Premises") to be
considered a Substitute Property, and has designated the following properties as
Replaced Properties and to be released from the applicable security documents:
CA0710625, 505 West 2nd Street, San Bernardino, California; CA0370051, 240 South
Arroyo Parkway, Pasadena, California; CA0591434, 1915 South Grand Avenue, Santa
Ana, California; and CA0010251, 1300 University Avenue, Berkeley, California.

          D.   Assignee and Assignor now desire to amend the Orange Assignment
of Leases to release the property identified as CA0591434, 1915 South Grand
Avenue, Santa Ana, California, from the lien of the Orange Assignment of Leases.

<PAGE>

                                    AGREEMENT

     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the above recitals and for other good
and valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby
acknowledged, Assignee and Assignor hereby agree as follows:

     1.   Definitions. All capitalized terms defined above and elsewhere in this
Amendment shall be used herein as so defined. Unless otherwise defined herein,
all other capitalized terms used herein shall have the respective meanings given
to those terms in the Loan Agreement.

     2.   Partial Release of Property under Orange Assignment of Leases.
Assignee hereby releases and discharges from the lien of the Orange Assignment
of Leases that portion, and only that portion, of the real property and
improvements encumbered by the Orange Assignment of Leases which is more
particularly described on Exhibit A attached hereto and made a part hereof (the
"Release Parcel"). All other "Property" described in and currently encumbered by
the Orange Assignment of Leases shall remain encumbered by the Orange Assignment
of Leases in accordance with the terms thereof.

     3.   Effect of this Amendment. On and after the date this Amendment is
recorded in the Official Records of Orange County, California, each reference in
the Loan Agreement to the Assignment of Leases and Rents encumbering the
property identified as CA0591434, 1915 South Grand Avenue, Santa Ana,
California, shall mean such Assignment of Leases and Rents as amended hereby.
Except as specifically amended above, (a) the Loan Agreement, the Orange
Assignment of Leases and the other Loan Documents shall remain in full force and
effect and are hereby ratified and affirmed and (b) the execution, delivery and
effectiveness of this Amendment shall not, except as expressly provided herein,
operate as a waiver of any right, power, or remedy of Assignee, nor constitute a
waiver of any provision of the Loan Agreement, the Orange Assignment of Leases
or any other Loan Document.

     4.   Miscellaneous.

          (a)  Counterparts. This Amendment may be executed in any number of
     counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which
     taken together shall constitute one and the same instrument. The signature
     page and acknowledgment of any counterpart may be removed therefrom and
     attached to any other counterpart to evidence execution thereof by all of
     the parties hereto without affecting the validity thereof.

          (b)  Headings. Headings in this Amendment are for convenience of
     reference only and are not part of the substance hereof.

          (c)  Governing Law. This Amendment shall be governed by and construed
     in accordance with the laws of the State of New York and the laws of the
     State of California as provided in the Orange Assignment of Leases.
