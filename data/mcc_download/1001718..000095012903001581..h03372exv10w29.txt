              any other tax levied against Landlord in substitution for or in

              a real estate tax or a specific tax on rentals from the Project,
              plus the cost, including legal, professional and appraiser's fees,
              of any negotiation, contest or appeal pursued by Landlord in an
              effort to reduce the tax or assessment on which any tax provided
              for in this Section is based. It is understood that Taxes shall

after delivery of statement reconciling collected taxes against actual taxes.
Any necessary adjustment shall be paid by Tenant to Landlord or refunded by

and levied upon the improvements, trade fixtures, furnishings, equipment and all
other personal property of Tenant contained in the Premises and the business

taxes are levied against Landlord or Landlord's property and if Landlord elects
to pay the same or if the assessed value of Landlord's property is increased by
inclusion of personal property and trade fixtures placed by Tenant in the
Premises and Landlord elects to pay the taxes based on such increase, Tenant
shall pay to Landlord, within thirty (30) days of Tenant's receipt of a detailed

imposed on the Landlord or the Tenant on account of or in lieu thereof, or as a
substitute for or in addition thereto, or of a nature similar thereto) and
whether recurring annually, or at other intervals or on a special or single
instance basis only. The foregoing shall not include Landlord's income or
personal taxes.

        GST shall not be deemed to be Rent, provided however that such tax, if
not paid when due, shall be collectible in the same manner as Rent in arrears.

        The Landlord shall allocate Taxes amongst categories of leaseable
premises in the Project on the basis of such factors as the Landlord determines
to be relevant, such as, by way of example, the types of business or activity
carried on therein, the locations in the Project, costs of construction,
relative benefits derived by leaseable premises, relative assessment values,
non-public school support designations, and vacancies. The Landlord shall adjust
the Tenant's Proportionate Share of Taxes, having regard to the category in
which the Tenant is placed by the Landlord. In determining the share of Taxes
which is payable by the Tenant pursuant to this Lease, Taxes shall include such
additional amounts as would have formed part of the Taxes had the Project been
fully assessed during the whole of the relevant period as fully completed and
fully occupied by tenants, with no special exemptions or reductions, and without
taking into account any actual or potential reduction of Taxes or change of
assessment category or class for leaseable premises within the Project which are
vacant.

        For the purposes of this Lease, Proportionate Share means a fraction
which has as its numerator, the rentable area of the Premises and as its
denominator the rentable area of the Project. It is anticipated that the
Tenant's Proportionate Share will be 214,321/ 387,407, namely

                                       5

                 force and effect during the Term of the Lease the following
                 insurance coverages insuring against claims which may arise
                 from or in connection with the Tenant's operation and use of
                 the Premises.

                 (a) "all-risks" insurance (including flood and earthquake) upon
                     all property owned by the Tenant or for which the Tenant is
                     legally liable, or which is installed by or on behalf of
                     the Tenant, and which is located on the Project including,
                     but not limited to, fittings, installations, alterations,
                     additions, partitions, trade fixtures, and anything in the
                     nature of a leasehold improvement (unless the Landlord has
                     specifically insured therefor) as well as the Tenant's
                     stock-in-trade, furniture and personal property, in an
                     amount of at least one hundred percent (100%) of the full

                     comprises full replacement cost of any leasehold
                     improvements, the decision of the Landlord will be

              at the Tenant's cost and all costs and expenses of the Landlord
              will be immediately paid by the Tenant to the Landlord together
              with a fee of ten percent (10%) representing the Landlord's
              overhead. This right is without prejudice to the other rights and
              remedies of the Landlord under this Lease. In case of loss or
              damage, the proceeds of insurance under boiler and machinery
              insurance and the leasehold improvements in the Premises shall be
              and are hereby assigned and made payable to the Landlord.

         (f)  Except for those acts which are in the ordinary course of the
              business of the Tenant, as contemplated by and in accordance with
              the provisions of this Lease, the Tenant shall not do or permit
              anywhere on the Project anything which might:

             (i) result in any increase in the cost of any insurance policy on
                 the Project;

            (ii) result in an actual or threatened cancellation of or adverse
                 change in any insurance policy on the Project; or

           (iii) be prohibited by any insurance policy on the Project.

         (g)  If any insurance policy on the Project or any part of it is
              cancelled or threatened by the insurer to be cancelled, or if the
              coverage under it is reduced in any way by the insurer because of
              the use or occupation of any part of the Premises by the Tenant or
              by any occupant of the Leased Premises, and if the Tenant fails to
              remedy the condition giving rise to the cancellation, threatened
              cancellation or reduction of coverage within forty-eight (48)
              hours after notice by the Landlord, the Landlord may, either:

              (i) re-enter and take possession of the Premises immediately by
                  leaving upon the Premises a notice of its intention to do so
                  upon which the Landlord will have the same rights and remedies
                  as are contained in Section 19; or


                                       8

<PAGE>

             (ii) enter upon the Premises and remedy the condition giving rise
                  to the cancellation, threatened cancellation or reduction of
                  coverage, and the Tenant will immediately pay the costs and
                  expenses to the Landlord, together with a fee of ten percent
                  (10%) of such costs and expenses representing the Landlord's
                  overhead, which costs and expenses may be collected by the
                  Landlord as Additional Rent and the Landlord will not be
                  liable for any injury caused to any property of the Tenant or
                  others located on the Premises as the result of the entry.
                  Such an entry by the Landlord is not a re-entry or a breach of
                  any covenant for quiet enjoyment.

6.       COMPLETION

         Landlord shall complete the Premises, including office space, pursuant
to the Plans. Provided that Landlord and Tenant each comply fully with the terms
contained in the "Build-to-Suit Addendum" attached hereto, then if Landlord, for
any reason whatsoever, cannot achieve Substantial Completion and deliver
possession of the Premises to Tenant on or before February 28, 2004, this Lease
shall not be void or voidable, nor shall Landlord be liable to Tenant for any
loss or damage resulting therefrom, but in that event the term of this Lease
shall be extended by such delay for each day beyond February 28, 2004 that
Substantial Completion has not occurred, save as hereinafter provided.
"Substantial Completion" shall occur upon the Architect's written certification
that the Landlord's work is substantially complete (in accordance with the
definition contained in the Construction Lien Act) in accordance with the Plans.
Excluding delays as a result of: (a) Tenant delay, and (b) change orders
requested by Tenant (including Modifications and Tenant Change Orders as
referred to in the Build-to-Suit Addendum) (collectively "TENANT DELAYS").
Landlord covenants and agrees to use all reasonable efforts to cause Substantial
Completion to occur on or before February 28, 2004. Landlord agrees to give
Tenant written notice of Substantial Completion at least thirty (30) days prior
to the date Substantial Completion is estimated to occur.

         In the event that the Premises have not been substantially completed by
April 1, 2004, other than by reason of Force Majeure or as a result of delay
arising in respect of environmental problems of which the Landlord was unaware
which are required to be remediated by it in accordance with applicable
environmental laws (it being understood and agreed that the Landlord shall
diligently proceed with such remediation as expeditiously as reasonably
possible) or as a result of any Tenant Delay, then the Tenant shall be entitled
to one (1) day of Basic Rent and Additional Rent in the nature of Operating
Costs and Taxes abatement for each day of delay. Subject to the foregoing, the
Landlord shall not be responsible for any costs, expenses, claims, losses or
damages suffered or incurred by the Tenant as a result of such delay. In the
event that the Premises have not been substantially completed by June 30, 2004
for any reason, other than as a result of Force Majeure or any Tenant Delay,
then the Tenant shall be entitled, within fifteen (15) Business Days to
terminate this Lease and the Landlord shall not be responsible for any costs,
expenses, claims, losses or damages suffered or incurred by the Tenant as a
result of such delay of Substantial Completion under this Lease. If the Tenant's
termination right has not been exercised, then this Lease shall continue in full
force and effect, subject to the foregoing provisions.

7.       REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE OF PREMISES AND ALTERATIONS

         Landlord shall make all repairs and replacements to the foundation, the
roof (including roof membrane and weatherproofing elements), structural
components of the Building, parking areas, Project infrastructure and the
exterior walls of the Building (except plate glass, windows, doors, door closure
devices, window and door frames, molding, locks and hardware) and shall make all
repairs and replacements to the HVAC System in the Premises during the 1st year
of the Term only, except that Landlord shall not be required to make any repairs
occasioned by any act of negligence of Tenant, its agents, employees, subtenant,
invitees and licensees ("LANDLORD'S REPAIRS"). During the Lease Term (but
specifically excluding any renewals or extensions) the cost of Landlord's
Repairs shall not be included in Operating Expenses (it being understood that if
a Landlord's Repair is incurred during the Term which would be characterized as
a capital cost has not been fully amortized or depreciated during the Term, then
the Landlord shall be entitled to include the unamortized or undepreciated
portion of such Landlord's Repairs in Operating Expenses during the Extension
Terms as contemplated by section 9(b)(xii), together with interest as
contemplated by section 9(b)(xiii)). In the event the Building should become in
need of repairs required to be made by Landlord hereunder, Tenant must give
immediate written notice to Landlord. Tenant shall be solely responsible for any
additional damage that occurs or any additional cost incurred in making such
repairs as a result of Tenant's failure to give timely notice to Landlord.

         Tenant shall, at its own expense, enter into a regularly scheduled
preventative maintenance/service contract with a maintenance contractor for
servicing all hot water, heating, ventilating and air conditioning systems (the
"HVAC SYSTEM") and equipment within the Premises provided that Tenant shall not
be required to enter into said preventative maintenance/service contract until
the expiration of the applicable warranty period for all hot water systems and
equipment and the HVAC System. The maintenance contractor and the maintenance
contract must be approved by Landlord, which approval shall not be unreasonably
delayed, withheld, or conditioned. The maintenance contract must include all
services suggested by the equipment manufacturer within the
operation/maintenance manual and must become effective (and a copy thereof
delivered to the Landlord) within thirty (30) days of the date Tenant takes
possession of the Premises. Landlord agrees to deliver to Tenant copies of any
warranties from the manufacturer of the HVAC System and such other units and/or
systems for which Tenant is responsible hereunder, and to pursue, to the extent
Tenant is not permitted to pursue, or cooperate with Tenant in pursuing claims
pursuant to said warranties. If the Landlord incurs costs to assist the Tenant
as aforesaid, then any such reasonable costs in excess of Two Thousand Dollars
($2,000.00) shall be for the account of the Tenant, and payable as Additional
Rent forthwith upon demand. During the 1st year of the Term Landlord shall be
entitled to the benefit of any warranties in respect of the HVAC System.

         Tenant agrees throughout the Lease Term, at Tenant's sole cost and
expense (and except for those above listed items that Landlord is required to
keep and maintain with regard to the Building as set forth in this Section 7
herein), to keep and maintain the Premises and all fixtures and equipment
therein, including all plumbing, HVAC, electrical, gas, water, sewage and like
fixtures and equipment, and also including the Premises window glass, loading
docks, exterior steps, doors, door frames, locks and hardware, interior
ceilings, walls and floors and


                                       10

<PAGE>

all signs of Tenant erected pursuant to Section 22 hereof on the outside of the
Building in good repair, order and condition, making all repairs and
replacements thereto as may be required; all repairs and replacements to be of
the same or better quality, design and class as the original work and equipment.
If any repairs required to be made by Tenant hereunder are not made within ten
(10) days after written notice delivered to Tenant by Landlord, Landlord may at
its option make such repairs without liability to Tenant for loss or damage
which may result to its equipment, fixtures, inventory or business by reason of
such repairs, and Tenant shall pay to Landlord upon demand as additional rent
hereunder the actual and reasonable cost of such repairs, together with
Landlord's administration fee equal to ten percent (10%) of such costs. At the
expiration or termination of this Lease, Tenant shall surrender the Premises in
good condition, reasonable wear and tear and loss by fire or other casualty
excepted. Provided that Tenant and Landlord determine that the replacement of
any HVAC equipment is less costly than the ongoing repair of same, the cost of
the replacement shall be apportioned such that Tenant's financial responsibility
for such replacement is the percentage calculated using the remaining lease term
as the numerator and the useful life of the replacement as the denominator.
Tenant's financial responsibility shall then be divided equally over the
remaining months of the Lease Term and paid to Landlord as Additional Rent.

         Tenant shall not make any alterations, additions, repairs,
improvements, or installations to the Premises which will cost, individually or
if a series of expenditures, in the aggregate greater than One Hundred Thousand
Dollars [$100,000.00] without the prior written consent of Landlord which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, provided that the
alteration, addition, or installation is non-structural and non-system related
and does not penetrate or alter the Building roof, floor slab, or exterior
walls, any warranty, or the Landlord's obligations hereunder. If such
alteration, addition, repair, improvement or installation is structural, or
affects any systems serving the Building or otherwise will adversely affect
Landlord's obligations hereunder or under any warranty, such consent may be
unreasonably withheld. All alterations, additions, repairs, improvements,
installations, equipment (excluding Tenant's trade equipment) and fixtures, by
whomever installed or erected (except such business trade fixtures belonging to
Tenant as can be removed without damage to or leaving incomplete the Premises or
Building) shall, at the Landlord's option, remain upon and be surrendered with
the Premises and become the property of Landlord at the termination of this
Lease without credit or compensation to Tenant. Otherwise, Landlord may require
same to be removed, and all damage caused by such removal to be repaired, at
Tenant's sole cost and expense. Any linoleum, carpeting or other floor covering
which may be cemented, nailed or otherwise affixed to the floor of the Premises
shall become the property of Landlord without credit or compensation to Tenant.
Tenant shall pay all reasonable costs and expenses of the Landlord in dealing
with Tenant's request for consent, supervision or performance of any work that
Landlord requires its contractors to perform.

         All construction work done by Tenant on the Premises shall be performed
in a good and workmanlike manner, in compliance with all governmental
requirements, and in such a manner as to cause a minimum of interference with
other construction in progress in the Building or the use or occupation of any
other tenant. Tenant agrees to indemnify Landlord and hold Landlord harmless
against any loss, liability or damage resulting from such work, and Tenant


                                       11

<PAGE>

shall, if requested by Landlord, furnish a bond or other security satisfactory
to Landlord against any such loss, liability or damage.

         Notwithstanding any provision of this Lease to the contrary Tenant
shall never, under any circumstances, have the power to subject the interest of
Landlord in the Project to any mechanics' or materialmen's liens or liens of any
kind nor shall any provision in this Lease ever be construed as empowering
Tenant to encumber or cause Tenant to encumber the title or interest of Landlord
in the Project. In order to comply with the provisions of the law, it is
specifically provided that neither Tenant nor anyone claiming by through or
under Tenant including but not limited to contractors, subcontractors,
materialmen, mechanics and labourers shall have any right to file or place any
kind of lien whatsoever upon the Project or any improvement thereon, and any
such liens are specifically prohibited. All parties with whom Tenant may deal
are put on notice that Tenant has no power to subject Landlord's interest to any
claim or lien of any kind or character, and all such persons so dealing with
Tenant must look solely to the credit of Tenant, and not to Landlord's interest
or assets. Tenant shall put all such parties with whom Tenant may deal on notice
of the terms of this Section. If at any time a lien or encumbrance is filed
against the Project as a result of Tenant's work, materials or obligations
Tenant shall promptly discharge or transfer to bond said lien or encumbrance,
and if said lien or encumbrance has not been discharged or transferred to bond
within fifteen (15) days from the date Tenant has received noticed that it is
filed, then, in addition to any other right or remedy of Landlord, Landlord may,
but shall not be obligated to, discharge the same either by paying the amount
claimed to be due or by procuring the discharge of such lien by a deposit in
court or by posting a bond. Any amount paid by Landlord for any of the aforesaid
purposes, or for the satisfaction of any other lien not caused by Landlord, and
all reasonable expenses of Landlord in defending any such action or in procuring
the discharge of any such lien plus a fee of ten percent (10%) of such costs and
expenses representing the Landlord's overhead, shall be deemed additional rent
hereunder and shall be repaid by Tenant to Landlord on demand.

8.       ACCEPTANCE OF PREMISES

         Tenant, upon Substantial Completion of the Premises in accordance with
the Plans and a joint walk-through by Landlord and Tenant (further subject to
any punch list items pursuant to the attached Build-to-Suit Addendum), shall
accept the Premises in their then condition as suited for the uses intended by
Tenant. If requested by Landlord, Tenant shall execute and deliver to Landlord a
written acceptance of the Premises. The date of completion of Premises shall be
defined as the date which Landlord achieves Substantial Completion as defined in
Paragraph 6 herein.

9.       COMMON AREAS AND OPERATING EXPENSES OF PREMISES

         (a)  The term "Common Area" is defined for all purposes of this Lease
              as that part of the Project which includes among other facilities,
              the structure of the Building, the roof, exterior wall assemblies,
              entrances and exits, stairways, common washrooms, utility rooms
              and facilities, general signs, all Building systems, including
              without limitation, HVAC and fire, security and other


                                       12

              systems, parking areas, sidewalks, driveways, truckways, loading
              areas and landscaped areas, and all interior and exterior areas,
              facilities, utilities, improvements, equipment, and installation
              which are not intended by the Landlord to be leased. The parties
              hereby agree that Tenant shall have non-exclusive, unrestricted
              access to the parking areas, driveways, walks, landscaped areas
              and loading areas appurtenant to the Building, subject to any
              exclusive rights granted to the Tenant pursuant to Section
              43(i)(d) and as indicated on Schedule "A" and any exclusive rights
              that may be granted to other tenants of the Project to use the
              parking areas or shipping areas. In addition, the Tenant shall be
              entitled to use:

              (i) the shipping area outlined in green on Schedule "A" which
                  shall be fenced off at the cost and expense of the Tenant; and

                  of trailers in connection with the Tenant's use of the Leased
                  Premises;

         (collectively the "TENANT'S EXCLUSIVE USE ADDITIONAL AREAS"). The
         Tenant shall not be required to pay Minimum Rent or Additional Rent in
         the nature of Occupancy Costs in respect of the Tenant's Exclusive Use
         Additional Areas, but such areas shall otherwise be considered to be
         part of the Leased Premises in respect of the Tenant's obligations
         pursuant to this Lease, including without limitation, insurance, repair
         and maintenance and the area of the Tenant's Exclusive Use Additional
         Areas shall, for the purposes of calculating the Tenant's Proportionate
         Share of Taxes, be added to the Rentable Area of the Leased Premises
         and the Rentable Area of the Project. For the sake of clarity, it is
         understood that the Tenant's Exclusive Use Additional Areas shall not
         be considered Common Area.

         Landlord shall be responsible for the operation, management, and
         maintenance of the Common Areas, the manner and the expenditures
         thereof to be consistent with those customary for similar buildings,
         and Tenant agrees to pay on the first day of each month during the
         Lease Term as additional rent as hereafter provided, its Proportionate
         Share of the cost of all Operating Expenses in accordance with the
         following:

         (b)  "Operating Expenses" are all costs incurred by Landlord relating
              to the ownership and operation of the Project including, but not
              limited to, the following:

                    systems.

              (iv)  Environmental monitoring and insurance programs (but for the
                    sake of clarity, the costs of remediating environmental
                    problems which are the Landlord's obligation hereunder shall
                    not be included in Operating Expenses).

              (v)   Maintenance of the Building including, but not limited to,
                    painting, caulking and repair and replacement of Building

                    and fire detection and sprinkler systems but excluding
                    Landlord's Repairs during the Term (but same are not to be
                    excluded during any Extension Term).

              (vi)  If Tenant fails to maintain the Premises, any reasonable and
                    verifiable expense incurred by Landlord for such maintenance
                    (in respect of which Tenant shall pay all of such cost and
                    not just its Proportionate Share).

              (vii) Insuring the Lands, Building, improvements, equipment and
                    other property in the Project from time to time owned or

                    legally liable, in the manner and form with the companies,
                    and with the coverage and the amounts which the Landlord, or

                    mentioned in subsection (xi) which the Landlord's
                    accountants have determined to be capital in nature (other
                    than any which are necessitated by a change in any Law
                    enacted, made or enforced by any Authority having
                    jurisdiction and which the Landlord has, in its sole
                    discretion, elected to treat as a current expense and which

         after the close of each calendar year, upon request of Tenant, Landlord
         will furnish to Tenant a detailed statement of Operating Expenses for
         such year, such statement to be prepared in accordance with generally
         accepted accounting practices but not audited. Any necessary adjustment
         shall be made within fifteen (15) days after delivery of such
         statement. Those Operating Expenses which are directly controllable by
         Landlord ("CONTROLLABLE EXPENSES") namely, costs of day-to-day
         landscaping and snow removal should not increase by more than three
         percent (3.0%) per annum during the Lease Term. After the expiry of two
         (2) years from the Commencement Date, the parties shall meet to
         determine what, if any, other expenses (excluding for the sake of
         clarity, taxes, insurance, utilities, capital costs, governmental
         charges, and costs as a result of Force Majeure, none of which are
         "controllable") are controllable and what, if any, cap on Controllable
         Expenses (other than landscaping and snow removal, the cap for which
         shall be three percent (3%)) is acceptable. Tenant shall have the
         right, at Tenant's sole cost and expense, to examine Landlord's books
         and records to


                                       15

<PAGE>

         review all invoices and supporting documentation in connection with the
         calculation of Operating Expenses, taxes, and Tenant's proportionate
         share. Should any such examination reveal overcharges in excess of five
         percent (5%), the reasonable costs of such examination shall be borne
         by Landlord.

         Landlord reserves the right to stop the supply of water, sewage,
         electrical current and other services, without incurring any liability
         to Tenant, where necessary by reason of accident or emergency, or for
         repairs, alterations, replacements or improvements in the judgment of
         Landlord desirable or necessary, or when prevented from supplying such
         services by strikes, lockouts, difficulty of obtaining materials,
         accidents or any other cause beyond Landlord's control, or by laws,
         orders or ability by exercise of reasonable diligence to obtain
         electricity, water, steam, coal, oil or other suitable fuel or power.
         However, in the case of repairs, alterations, replacements or
         improvements which are under Landlord's control, Landlord agrees to
         give Tenant reasonable notice of repairs, alterations, replacements or
         improvements. No diminution or abatement of rent or other compensation
         shall or will be claimed by Tenant as a result of, nor shall this Lease
         or any of the obligations of Tenant be affected or reduced by reason
         of, any such interruption, curtailment or suspension, subject to
         Section 10 (b) hereof.

         (c)  The Tenant shall pay to Landlord as Additional Rent on an annual
              basis a management fee equal to Ten Cents (.10(cent)) per square
              foot of the Rentable Area of the Premises, payable monthly. Such
              fee shall escalate at a rate of three percent (3%) per annum.

         (d)  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Operating
              Expenses shall not include any cost or expense attributable to:

              (i)   Repairs or other work occasioned by fire, windstorm or
                    casualty of an insurable nature in excess of any deductible
                    feature to the extent Landlord receives insurance proceeds
                    or by the exercise of the right of eminent domain to the
                    extent such costs are recovered from the relevant authority,
                    exercising the right of eminent domain;

              (ii)  Leasing commissions, attorney's fees, costs and
                    disbursements and other expenses incurred in connection with

                    any), or prospective tenants;

              (iii) Expenses incurred in renovating or otherwise improving or
                    decorating, painting or redecorating space for the Tenant or
                    other tenants (if any) or other occupants or vacant space;

              (iv)  Landlord's costs of electricity and other services sold to
                    tenants and for which Landlord is entitled to be reimbursed
                    by tenants as an additional charge or rental over the basic
                    rent payable or Operating Expenses under the lease with such
                    tenant;


                                       16

         (v)   Except as otherwise provided herein, costs incurred by Landlord
               for alterations or repairs to the Building or Project which are

                    affiliates of Landlord for services on or to the Project, to

                    competitive costs of such services not so rendered by a
                    subsidiary of an affiliate;

              (xi)  Interest on debt or amortization payments on any mortgage or

<PAGE>

                    but for such breach by Landlord;

              (xxv) The cost of any utilities the service of which to Tenant is

attributable to both the Project and such other building(s), then only such

judgment) to the Project shall be included in Operating Expenses.

10.      UTILITIES AND SERVICES

         (a)  Tenant shall pay directly gas, electricity, fuel, and any other
              utilities for the Premises, or used by Tenant in connection
              therewith. If Tenant does not pay said utilities, Landlord may pay
              the same and such payment together with Landlord's administration
              fee of ten percent (10%) of such costs shall be deemed additional
              rent payable by Tenant upon demand by Landlord. In addition:

              (i)   repair, maintenance and replacement of the HVAC System shall
                    be dealt with in accordance with Section 7 of this Lease;

              (ii)  excluding Landlord's Repairs, the Tenant will operate,
                    maintain, repair and replace the portions of the HVAC System
                    serving the Premises exclusively in order to maintain
                    reasonable conditions of temperature and humidity within the
                    Premises. The Tenant will comply with the stipulations and
                    with the Rules and Regulations of the Landlord pertaining to
                    the operation and regulation of that equipment.


                                       18

<PAGE>

         (b)  Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this Lease: (i)
              in the event that the Landlord is unable to supply any of the
              Building's electrical, heating, air conditioning, or water systems
              serving the Premises (collectively, the "ESSENTIAL SERVICES"), or
              (ii) the Landlord is unable to provide access to the Premises in
              accordance with its obligations hereunder (the "ACCESS RIGHTS")
              and such inability of the Landlord materially impairs the Tenant's
              ability to carry on its business in the Leased Premises for a
              period of five (5) consecutive days, the Basic Rent and Additional
              Rent shall abate commencing with the sixth (6th) day of such
              material interference with the Tenant's business, save as
              hereinafter provided. Such abatement shall continue until the
              Essential Services and Access Rights have been restored to such
              extent that the lack of any Essential Services or Access Rights no
              longer materially impairs the Tenant's ability to carry on its
              business in the Leased Premises. The Tenant shall not be entitled
              to such an abatement to the extent that the Landlord's inability
              to supply Essential Services or Access Rights is caused by events
              beyond the Landlord's control, unless the Landlord is otherwise
              compensated for such Rent out of insurance proceeds which are or
              ought to have been payable to it, in which case the Tenant shall
              be entitled to abatement as provided herein to the extent of such
              proceeds. In the event of any stoppage or interruption of
              Essential Services to the Premises or inability to provide the
              Access Rights, the Landlord shall use diligent efforts to restore
              Essential Services to the Leased Premises and the Access Rights as
              soon as possible.

         (c)  If at any time during the Term the Landlord, for reasons within
              its control, fails to provide Access Rights or any of the
              Essential Services and such failure materially impairs the
              Tenant's ability to carry on business in the Leased Premises, and
              such failure shall continue for five (5) consecutive days after
              written notice thereof from the Tenant, the Tenant shall have the
              right, but shall not be required to, take such reasonable steps as
              shall be necessary to cause the provision of such Essential
              Services or Access Rights, as applicable, including the payment of
              outstanding invoices and/or the performance of maintenance,
              repairs or replacements (such work performed by the Tenant shall
              be referred to herein as "SELF HELP WORK"), and any reasonable
              sums expended by the Tenant in so doing, commencing thirty (30)
              days after written demand accompanied by supporting invoices,
              shall be paid by the Landlord to the Tenant within thirty (30)
              days of receipt of written demand of the Tenant accompanied by
              invoices supporting such expenditures. Notwithstanding the
              foregoing, the Tenant: (i) shall provide the Landlord twenty-four
              (24) hours written notice prior to performing any self help work;
              (ii) shall not commence performance of any self help work for so
              long as the Landlord has commenced work to cure the applicable
              default and continues to diligently perform such work; and (iii)
              shall not perform any self help work in a manner that unreasonably
              interferes with the Landlord's or any other tenant's use of the
              Project.

         (d)  Subject to subsections (b) and (c) hereof, should Landlord fail to
              perform any other term or covenant under this Lease and if any
              such default shall not be cured


                                       19

<PAGE>

              and shall accordingly be continuing thirty (30) days following
              written notice by Tenant to Landlord of such default (in the event
              that such default consists of a breach or failure by Landlord to
              pay any monetary amount due and payable by Landlord to Tenant) or
              sixty (60) days following written notice by Tenant to Landlord of
              such default (in the event such default consists of a breach or
              failure by Landlord to comply with any obligation of Landlord
              other than one involving the payment of a monetary amount payable
              by Landlord to Tenant or such longer period of time as may be
              reasonably required by Landlord to cure such default, then, in
              either such event, Tenant shall have the option (at Tenant's sole
              discretion) of remedying such default by self-help work as
              contemplated by subsection (c).

         (e)  If Landlord fails to pay the amounts referred to in subsection (c)
              and (d) hereof, and there is no dispute between the parties as to
              its obligations to do so (which dispute if not resolved within
              thirty (30) days shall be referred to arbitration), then Tenant
              shall be entitled to offset such unpaid amounts against Basic Rent
              as it falls due.

11.      USE OF PREMISES

         The Premises shall be used only for the purpose of freight forwarding,
receiving, storing, shipping and selling products, materials and merchandise
made and/or distributed by Tenant and for such other lawful purposes as may be
incidental thereto and approved by Landlord and shall not be used for any of the
Prohibited Uses. Tenant shall, at its sole cost and expense promptly: (i) obtain
any and all licenses and permits necessary for any such use; and (ii) comply
with all governmental laws, ordinances, regulations, orders and directives
applicable to the use or misuse of the Premises; and (iii) comply with all rules
and regulations of the Landlord in respect of the Project; and (iv) not cause
any waste or damage or any nuisance; and (v) not disturb or annoy the operations
of any other tenant in the Project or cause any interference with the safety,
comfort or convenience of the Landlord, other occupants of the Project or their
customers or invitees. Tenant shall not receive, store or otherwise handle any
product, material or merchandise which is explosive or highly flammable or of a
hazardous nature without the Landlord's consent; or permit the Premises to be
used for any purpose which would render the insurance thereon void or the
insurance risk more hazardous without the Landlord's consent. The Premises shall
not be used for any illegal purposes, in violation of any regulation of any
governmental body or in any manner to create any nuisance. If the insurance
premiums on the Building are increased due to Tenant's use of the Premises,
Tenant shall pay to Landlord the full amount of such increase in Premiums.
Tenant shall provide to Landlord a copy of all hazardous materials from time to
time intended to be used in the ordinary course of Tenant's business in the
Premises, for Landlord's approval which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
provided such use shall nonetheless be in accordance with the provisions of
Section 16 hereof.


                                       20

<PAGE>

12.      ABANDONMENT OF PREMISES

         Tenant agrees not to abandon or vacate the Premises during the Lease
Term, and Tenant agrees to use said Premises for the purpose herein leased until
the expiration hereof. However, Tenant may vacate (it being understood that
Tenant will nonetheless comply with all of its other obligations hereunder)
provided that Landlord shall have the right but not the obligation to market the
property for lease to a third party tenant and to terminate the Lease in the
event that the Premises are leased to a third party tenant (or to release the
Tenant of its obligations in respect of a portion of the Premises leased to a
third party tenant). Landlord shall have complete access to the Property for
purposes of marketing.

13.      DAMAGE BY CASUALTY

         (a)  If the Building should be damaged or destroyed by fire or other
              peril, Tenant immediately shall give written notice to Landlord.
              If the Building should be totally destroyed by any peril covered
              by the insurance to be provided by Landlord under Paragraph 5(d)
              above, or if they should be so damaged thereby that, in Landlord's
              estimation, rebuilding or repairs cannot be completed within one
              hundred eighty (180) days after the date of such damage, this
              Lease shall terminate and the Rent shall be abated during the
              unexpired portion of this Lease effective upon the date of the
              occurrence of such damage.

         (b)  If the Building situated upon the Project of which the Premises
              are a part, should be damaged by any peril covered by the
              insurance to be provided by Landlord under Paragraph 5(d) herein,
              and in Landlord's estimation, rebuilding or repairs can be
              substantially completed within one hundred eighty (180) days after
              the date of such damage, this Lease shall not terminate, and
              Landlord shall restore the Premises to the same extent as its
              original Landlord's Work hereunder, except that Landlord shall not
              be required to rebuild, repair or replace any part of the
              partitions, fixtures, additions and other improvements that may
              have been constructed, erected or installed in, or about the
              Premises for the benefit of, or by or for Tenant. In such event,
              Rent shall abate hereunder for that portion of the Premises which
              can not reasonably be expected to be used by Tenant for such
              period that the Landlord's insurance otherwise compensates
              Landlord for such Rent. If such repairs and rebuilding have not
              been commenced or such work is not substantially underway within
              one hundred and twenty (120) days after the date of such damage
              (subject to delays outside of Landlord's control), Tenant, as
              Tenant's exclusive remedy, may terminate this Lease by delivering
              written notice of termination to Landlord in which event its
              rights and obligations hereunder shall cease and terminate.

         (c)  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the event the
              holder of any indebtedness secured by a mortgage or deed of trust
              covering the Project requires that the insurance proceeds be
              applied to such indebtedness, then Landlord shall have the right
              to terminate this Lease by delivering written notice of
              termination to Tenant within fifteen (15) days after such
              requirement is made


                                       21

<PAGE>


              known by any such holder, whereupon all rights and obligations
              hereunder shall cease and terminate.

         (d)  If the Project is damaged by any peril not covered by the
              insurance to be provided by Landlord under Paragraph 5(d) above
              and the cost to repair such damage exceeds any amount Tenant may
              elect to contribute or Landlord may elect to contribute (neither
              party being obligated to do so), or in the event that the damage
              occurs in the last two (2) Lease Years of the Term, Landlord may
              elect either to commence to repair and restore the Premises, in
              which event this Lease shall remain in full force and effect, or
              not to repair and restore the Premises, in which event this Lease
              shall terminate.

14.      INDEMNITY AND PUBLIC LIABILITY

         (a)  Subject to subsections (b) and (c) hereof, each of the Landlord
              and Tenant hereby releases the other and waives all claims against
              the other and those for whom the other is in law responsible with
              respect to occurrences insured against or required to be insured
              against by the releasing party, whether any such claims arise as a
              result of the negligence or otherwise of the other or those for
              whom it is in law responsible.

         (b) Such release and waiver shall be effective only to the extent of
             proceeds of insurance received by the releasing party and proceeds
             which would have been received if the releasing party obtained all
             insurance required to be obtained by it under this Lease and for
             this purpose deductible amounts shall be deemed to be proceeds of
             insurance received, and Tenant shall be deemed to carry business
             interruption insurance for direct and indirect loss of earnings for
             all perils or attributable to prevension of access, in a profits
             form of coverage with a twelve (12) month indemnity period.

         (c)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 14, the
              Landlord and Tenant shall each be liable to any third person
              (being any person other than the Landlord or Tenant) to the extent
              of their respective fault or negligence and each shall be entitled
              to full indemnity and contribution from the other to the extent of
              the other's fault or negligence.

         To the extent not released above, each party shall indemnify and save
harmless the other from all liabilities, damages, losses or expenses growing out
of:

         (a)  any breach, violation or non-performance by the indemnifying party
              of any covenant, condition or agreement in this Lease;

         (b)  any loss, cost or expense arising from or occasioned by the act,
              default or negligence of the indemnifying party, its officers,
              agents, servants, employees, contractors, customers, invitees or
              licensees; and


                                       22

<PAGE>

         (c) any obligation of the indemnifying party arising or outstanding
             upon the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease.

         Such indemnity shall survive the termination of this Lease, anything in
this Lease to the contrary notwithstanding.

15.      GOVERNMENTAL ORDERS

         Tenant agrees, at its own expense, to promptly comply with all
requirements of any legally constituted public authority made necessary by
reason of Tenant's occupancy of said Premises. Landlord agrees to promptly
comply with any such requirements if not made necessary by reason of Tenant's
occupancy.

16.      ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

16.1     (a) Reportable Uses Require Consent. The term "Hazardous Substance" as
             used in this Lease shall mean any product, substance, chemical,
             material or waste whose presence, nature, quantity and/or intensity
             of existence, use, manufacture, disposal, transportation, spill,
             release or effect, either by itself or in combination with other
             materials expected to be on the Project, is either: (i) potentially
             injurious to the public health, safety or welfare, the environment,
             or the Project; (ii) regulated or monitored by any governmental
             authority; or (iii) a basis for potential liability of Landlord to
             any governmental agency or third party under any applicable statute
             or common law theory. Hazardous Substance shall include, but not be
             limited to, hydrocarbons, petroleum, gasoline, crude oil or any
             products or by-products thereof. Tenant shall not engage in any
             activity in or about the Project which constitutes a Reportable Use
             (as hereinafter defined) of Hazardous Substances without the
             express prior written consent of Landlord and compliance in a
             timely manner (at Tenant's sole cost and expense) with all
             Applicable Requirements (as defined in Paragraph 16.2, below).
             "Reportable Use" shall mean (i) the installation or use of any
             above or below ground storage tank, (ii) the generation,
             possession, storage, use, transportation, or disposal of a
             Hazardous Substance that requires a permit from, or with respect to
             which a report, notice, registration or business plan is required
             to be filed with, any governmental authority, and (iii) the
             presence in, on or about the Project of a Hazardous Substance with
             respect to which any Applicable Requirements require that a notice
             be given to persons entering or occupying the Project or
             neighboring properties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenant may,
             without Landlord's prior consent, but upon written notice to
             Landlord and in strict compliance with all Applicable Requirements,
             use any ordinary and customary materials reasonably required to be
             used by Tenant in the normal course of the permitted use in Section
             11, above, so long as such use is not a Reportable Use and does not
             expose the Project, or neighboring properties to any risk of
             contamination or damage or expose Landlord to any liability
             therefor. In addition, Landlord may (but without any obligation to
             do so) condition its consent to any Reportable Use of any Hazardous
             Substance by Tenant upon

                                       23

<PAGE>



             Tenant's giving Landlord such additional assurances as Landlord, in
             its reasonable discretion, deems necessary to protect itself, the
             public, the Project and the environment against damage,
             contamination or injury and/or liability therefore, including but
             not limited to the installation (and, at Landlord's option, removal
             on or before Lease expiration or earlier termination) of reasonably
             necessary protective modifications to the Project (such as concrete
             encasements) and/or the procurement of such additional insurance
             coverages as Landlord deems necessary.

         (b) Duty to Inform Landlord. If Tenant knows, or has reasonable cause
             to believe, that a Hazardous Substance is located in, under or
             about the Project or the Building, Tenant shall immediately give
             Landlord written notice thereof, together with a copy of any
             statement, report, notice, registration, application, permit,
             business plan, license, claim, action, or proceeding given to, or
             received from, any governmental authority or private party
             concerning the presence, spill, release, discharge of, or exposure
             to, such Hazardous Substance. Tenant shall not cause or permit any
             Hazardous Substance to be spilled or released in, on, under or
             about the Project (including, without limitation, through the
             plumbing or sanitary sewer system).

         (c) Indemnification. Tenant shall indemnify, protect, defend and hold
             Landlord, its Lenders (hereinafter defined), and the officers,
             directors, shareholders, partners, and employees of the foregoing
             ("LANDLORD ENTITIES") and the Project, harmless from and against
             any and all damages, liabilities, judgments, costs, claims, liens,
             expenses, penalties, loss of permits and reasonable attorneys' and
             consultants' fees arising out of or involving any Hazardous
             Substance brought onto the Project by or for Tenant or by any of
             Tenant's employees, agents, contractors or invitees. Tenant's
             obligations under this Paragraph 16.1(c) shall include, but not be
             limited to, the effects of any contamination or injury to person,
             property or the environment created or suffered by Tenant, and the
             cost of investigation (including consultants' and attorneys' fees
             and testing), removal, remediation, restoration and/or abatement
             thereof, or of any contamination therein involved. Tenant's
             obligations under this Paragraph 16.1(c) shall survive the
             expiration or earlier termination of this Lease.

         (d) Tenant shall be permitted to bring de minimis quantities of
             Hazardous Substances upon the Premises in the ordinary course of
             Tenant's business, so long as: (i) Tenant otherwise complies with
             the provisions of this Section 16; (ii) Tenant's business is not
             primarily or incidentally focused on the distribution or storage of
             Hazardous Substances; and (iii) no such activity of Tenant violates
             any rule or requirement of the applicable fire marshal or other
             applicable governing entity. The permission granted in this section
             16.1(d) shall be personal to Tenant and shall not be transferable
             to any subtenant or assignee which does not own or is not owned or
             under common control with Tenant.

16.2         Tenant's Compliance with Requirements. Tenant shall, at Tenant's
             sole cost and expense, fully, diligently and in a timely manner,
             comply with all "Applicable Requirements," which term is used in
             this Lease to mean all laws, rules, regulations, ordinances,
             directives, administrative decisions, judicial rulings, and the
             like, of any governmental authority; all covenants, easements and
             restrictions of record; all permits; all requirements of any
             applicable fire insurance underwriter or rating bureau; and the
             recommendations of Tenant's and/or Landlord's engineers and/or
             consultants, relating in any manner to the Project, including the
             Premises (including but not limited to matters pertaining to: (i)
             industrial hygiene; (ii) environmental conditions on, in, under or
             about the Project, including soil and groundwater conditions; and
             (iii) the use, generation, manufacture, production, installation,
             maintenance, removal, transportation, storage, spill or release of
             any Hazardous Substance), now in effect or which may hereafter come
             into effect. Tenant shall, within 5 days after receipt of
             Landlord's written request, provide Landlord with copies of all
             documents and information evidencing Tenant's compliance with any
             Applicable Requirements and shall immediately upon receipt, notify
             Landlord in writing (with copies of any documents involved) of any
             threatened or actual claim, notice, citation, warning, complaint or
             report pertaining to or involving failure by Tenant or the Project
             to comply with any Applicable Requirements.

16.3         Inspection; Compliance with Law. In addition to Landlord's
             environmental monitoring and insurance program, the cost of which
             is included in Operating Expenses, Landlord and the holders of any
             mortgages, deeds of trust or ground leases on the Project
             ("Lenders") shall have the right to enter the Premises at any time
             in the case of an emergency, and otherwise at reasonable times with
             24 hours notice to Tenant, for the purpose of inspecting the
             condition of the Premises and for verifying compliance by Tenant
             with this Lease and all Applicable Requirements. Landlord shall be
             entitled to employ experts and/or consultants in connection
             therewith to advise Landlord with respect to Tenant's installation,
             operation, use, monitoring, maintenance, or removal of any
             Hazardous Substance on or from the Premises or the Project. The
             cost and expenses of any such inspections shall be paid by the
             party requesting same unless a violation of Applicable Requirements
             exists or is imminent or the inspection is requested or ordered by
             a governmental authority. In the event of a violation of the
             Applicable Requirement by Tenant, Tenant shall upon request
             reimburse Landlord or Landlord's Lender, as the case may be, for
             the costs and expenses of such inspections.

16.4         Landlord represents that to the best of its information and belief
             all activities of Landlord on the Premises (which includes
             development and construction of same) have and will be conducted in
             compliance with applicable environmental laws. Landlord warrants
             that to the best of its information and belief it is currently in
             material compliance with all applicable environmental laws with
             respect to the Premises and that there are no pending or, to the
             best of Landlord's knowledge, threatened notices of deficiency,
             notices of violation, orders or judicial administrative actions
             involving alleged violations by Landlord of any environmental laws
             concerning the Premises. Landlord, at Landlord's sole cost and
             expense, shall be responsible for obtaining all permits, licenses
             and approvals under environmental laws necessary for Landlord's


                                       25

<PAGE>

             activities upon the Premises and shall make all notifications and
             registrations required by any applicable environmental law.
             Landlord at Landlord's sole cost and expense, shall at all times
             comply with the terms and conditions of all such permits, licenses,
             approvals, notifications and registrations and with any other
             applicable environmental laws applicable to Landlord's activities
             upon the Project.

17.      EMINENT DOMAIN

         If the Premises or any substantial part thereof shall be taken by any
competent authority under the power of eminent domain or be acquired for any
public or quasi-public use or purpose, the Lease Term shall cease and terminate
upon the date when the possession of said Premises or the part thereof so taken
shall be required for such use or purpose and without apportionment of the
award, and Tenant shall have no claim against Landlord for the value of the
unexpired Lease Term. If any condemnation proceeding shall be instituted in
which it is sought to take or damage any part of the Building or the Land under
it or contiguous thereto, or if the grade of any street or alley adjacent to the
Building is changed by any competent authority and such change of grade makes it
necessary or desirable to remodel the Building to conform to the changed grade,
Landlord shall have the right to cancel this Lease after having given written
notice of cancellation to Tenant not less than ninety (90) days prior to the
date of cancellation designated in the notice. In either of said events, rent at
the then current rate shall be apportioned as of the date of the termination. No
money or other consideration shall be payable by Landlord to Tenant for the
right of cancellation and Tenant shall have no right to share in the
condemnation award or in any judgment for damages caused by the taking or the
change of grade. Nothing in this paragraph shall preclude an award being made to
Tenant by the condemning authority for loss of business or depreciation to and
cost of removal of equipment or fixtures, provided that any such award to Tenant
does not diminish or replace in any way the award payable to Landlord hereunder.
If this lease is not terminated, provided that repair, replacement, or
reconstruction is reasonable, Landlord shall promptly restore the Building to a
single architectural unit and restore that portion of the remaining Premises as
previously served the Premises, taking into consideration the full effect of the
condemnation, and to the extent of the condemnation proceeds made available to
Landlord. None of the costs, incurred by Landlord in connection with any of the
foregoing shall be included in Operating Expenses. All rentals and tenants
proportionate share shall be adjusted following such condemnation to reflect any
adjustments in the size or use of the Premises or Building.


18.      ASSIGNMENT AND SUBLETTING

18.1     Landlord's Consent Required.

         (a) Tenant shall not assign, transfer, mortgage or otherwise transfer
             or encumber (collectively, "assign") or sublet, license or
             otherwise grant a right in respect of (a "SUBLEASE") (collectively,
             a "TRANSFER"), all or any part of Tenant's interest in this Lease
             or in the Premises without Landlord's prior written consent which
             consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. Landlord's consent or
             refusal to consent shall be provided to Tenant within twenty (20)
             days of Landlord's


                                       26

<PAGE>

             receipt of the request provided that Tenant's criteria includes the
             relevant criteria listed in the following sentence. Relevant
             criteria in determining reasonability of consent include, but are
             not limited to, credit history of a proposed assignee or subtenant,
             references from prior landlords, and any intensification of use of
             the Premises or the Common Areas. Assignment or subletting shall
             not release Tenant from its obligations hereunder. The consent by
             the Landlord to any assignment or sublease, will not constitute a
             waiver of the necessity for the Landlord's consent to any
             subsequent or other assignment or sublease. Tenant shall not sublet
             or assign or enter into other arrangements such that the amounts to
             be paid by the subtenant or assignee thereunder would be based, in
             whole or in part, on the income or profits derived by the business
             activities of the subtenant or assignee. The requirements of this
             Section 18.1 shall apply to any further subleasing by any
             subtenant. Tenant shall be responsible for all of Landlord's costs
             in considering and processing any request for cost, not to exceed
             Two Thousand Dollars ($2,000.00).

         (b) A change in the control of Tenant shall constitute a Transfer
             requiring Landlord's consent, provided however this shall not apply
             to the Tenant as long as:

             (A) the Tenant is a public corporation whose shares are traded and
                 listed on any recognized stock exchange in Canada or the United
                 States; or

             (B) the Tenant is a private corporation and is controlled by a
                 public corporation described above in subsection (A).

         Subject to the foregoing, the transfer, on a cumulative basis, of 25%
         or mere of the voting or management control of Tenant or of the
         beneficial ownership interest in Tenant, directly or indirectly, shall
         constitute a change in control for this purpose.

         (c) No acceptance by Landlord of any rent or any other sum of money
             from any Transferee shall be deemed to constitute Landlord's
             consent to any Transfer. No such Transfer or collection shall be
             deemed the acceptance of the Transferee, as Tenant, or a release of
             Tenant from the further performance by Tenant of Tenant's
             obligations under this Lease. Any Transfer consented to by Landlord
             shall not relieve Tenant (or its Transferee) from obtaining
             Landlord's consent to any subsequent Transfer. Further, for any
             Transfer after the initial term of this Lease, in the event that
             the rental due and payable by a Transferer under any such permitted
             Transfer (or a combination of the rental payable under such
             sublease plus any bonus or other consideration therefor or incident
             thereto) exceeds the hereinabove provided rental payable under this
             Lease or if with respect to a permitted Transfer by Tenant, the
             consideration payable to Tenant by the Transferee exceeds the
             rental payable under this Lease, Tenant shall pay Landlord 50% of
             any profits paid in connection with a Transfer in excess of
             Tenant's Rent


                                       27

<PAGE>


             obligations hereunder within ten (10) days following receipt
             thereof by Tenant from such Transferee, such profits shall be
             calculated after deducting all reasonable costs incurred by Tenant
             in connection with the space subject to the Transfer, which shall
             include, but not be limited to, improvements, leasing commissions
             and the time to sublease and remodel the Premises.

         (d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, so long as the Tenant is EGL Eagle
             Global Logistics (Canada) Corp., the Tenant shall have the right,
             without the consent of the Landlord but upon prior written notice
             to the Landlord, and in accordance with the remaining provisions of
             this Section 18, to assign this Lease, or sublet the whole of the
             Premises to a holding body corporate, a subsidiary body corporate
             or an affiliate of the Tenant (within the meaning of the Canada
             Business Corporations Act), but only so long as such holding body
             corporate, subsidiary body corporate or affiliate remains a holding
             body corporate, subsidiary body corporate or affiliate (as the case
             may be) of the Tenant (hereinafter called a "RELATED CORPORATION").

         The following additional provisions must also be satisfied:

         (i)   in the case of an assignment, such Related Corporation shall
               enter into an agreement with both the Landlord and the Tenant
               agreeing to be bound by the Tenant's obligations hereunder; and

         (ii)  in the event the Related Corporation ceases for any reason to be
               a Related Corporation, such event shall constitute a Transfer, to
               be dealt with in accordance with this Section 18.

         In each of the foregoing cases:

             A.  such Transferee shall carry on the same business as is
                 permitted to be carried on by the Tenant pursuant to Section 11
                 of this Lease;

             B.  there shall remain a continuity of business practices and
                 policies and mode and style of operation notwithstanding any
                 such Transfer; and

             C.  notwithstanding any such Transfer, the Tenant shall remain
                 liable for performance of and compliance with all of the terms,
                 conditions and provisions of this Lease.

         (e) If there is a permitted assignment of this Lease, the Landlord may
             collect Rent from the Transferee and apply the net amount collected
             to the Rent required to be paid under this Lease, but no acceptance
             by the Landlord of any payments by a Transferee will be construed
             as a waiver of any right of the Landlord, or the acceptance of the
             Transferee as tenant or a release of the Tenant from the

<PAGE>

             performance of its obligations under this Lease. Any consent by the
             Landlord will be subject to the following conditions:

             (i)    if the Transferee is an assignee, it will promptly execute
                    an agreement agreeing with the Landlord to be bound by all
                    the Tenant's obligations under this Lease as if the
                    Transferee had originally executed this Lease as tenant;

             (ii)   if the Transferee is a subtenant, agreeing that, at the
                    Landlord's option, all of the Transferee's right, title and
                    interest in and to the Premises absolutely terminates upon
                    the surrender, release, disclaimer or merger of this Lease,
                    notwithstanding the provisions of section 21 or section
                    39(2) of the Commercial Tenancies Act;

             (iii)  the Tenant will execute an Indemnity Agreement in a form
                    satisfactory to the Landlord, in respect of the performance
                    of the Tenant's and the Transferee's obligations under this
                    Lease and whether the Indemnity Agreement is executed or
                    not, the Tenant will remain jointly and severally liable
                    with the Transferee on this Lease and will not be released
                    from any obligations under this Lease as amended from time
                    to time. If this Lease is renewed or extended by any
                    Transferee pursuant to any option of the Tenant, the
                    Transferor shall be liable for all of the obligations of the
                    Tenant throughout the Term as renewed or extended;

             (iv)   the Landlord may also require the Transferee to waive any
                    rights, pursuant to subsection 39(2) of the Commercial
                    Tenancies Act (Ontario) and any amendments thereto and any
                    other statutory provisions of the same or similar affect, to
                    pay any Rent less than any amount payable hereunder; and

             (v)    the Landlord may also require, if the Transfer is a sublease
                    or other transaction, that upon notice from the Landlord to
                    the Transferee all amounts payable by the Transferee each
                    month shall be paid directly to the Landlord who shall apply
                    the same on account of the Tenant's obligations under this
                    Lease.

         (f) If the Landlord sells, leases or otherwise disposes of the Project
             or any part of it, or if it assigns this Lease or any interest of
             the Landlord in it, then, to the extent that the purchaser,
             transferee or assignee assumes the obligations of the Landlord
             under this Lease, the Landlord will, without further agreement, be
             released from all liability with respect to the Landlord's
             obligations under this Lease after such sale, lease, disposition or
             assignment.

19.      DEFAULT

         (a) It is mutually agreed that the following events shall be deemed a
             breach and default hereunder by Tenant: (i) Tenant shall default in
             the payment of rent


                                       29

<PAGE>

             herein reserved, when due, and shall fail to cure said default
             within ten (10) days after written notice thereof from Landlord
             (provided that Landlord shall not be required to provide Tenant
             with notice of such failure to pay rent more than two (2) times in
             any twelve (12) month period; any subsequent failure timely pay
             rent in such twelve (12) month period shall constitute a default by
             Tenant under this Lease, entitling Landlord to all of its remedies
             provided for herein without any requirement of notice and/or
             opportunity to cure); (ii) Tenant shall be in default in performing
             any of the terms or provisions of this Lease other than the
             provision requiring the payment of rent, and shall fail to cure
             such default within twenty (20) days after the date of receipt of
             written notice of default from Landlord; or if such default cannot
             reasonably be cured within twenty (20) days, if Tenant shall fail
             to commence such cure within twenty (20) days and diligently
             prosecute such cure to completion; (iii) Tenant is adjudicated
             bankrupt or commits an act of bankruptcy as defined in the
             Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act or Tenant becomes bankrupt or
             insolvent; (iv) a receiver, trustee, receiver and manager or
             similar person is appointed for Tenant's property; (v) whether
             voluntarily or involuntarily, Tenant takes advantage of any debtor
             relief proceedings under any present or future law; (vi) Tenant
             makes an assignment for benefit of creditors; (vii) Tenant's
             effects should be levied upon or attached under process against
             Tenant, not satisfied or dissolved within thirty (30) days after
             written notice from Landlord to Tenant to obtain satisfaction
             thereof; and (viii) an order is made for the winding up or
             liquidation of the Tenant or it voluntarily commences winding up or
             liquidation proceedings. In any of said events, Landlord at its
             option may terminate this Lease by written notice to Tenant,
             whereupon this Lease shall terminate, provided, however that Tenant
             shall be obligated to Landlord for all Rent, including any
             Additional Rent, incurred prior to such termination date. Any
             notice provided in this Section may be given by Landlord, or its
             attorney. Upon such termination by Landlord, Tenant will at once
             surrender possession of the Premises to Landlord and remove all of
             Tenant's effects therefrom; and Landlord may forthwith reenter the
             Premises and repossess itself thereof, and remove all persons and
             effects therefrom, using such force as may be necessary (in
             accordance with any and all applicable laws) without being guilty
             of trespass, forcible entry or detainer or other tort.

         (b) As an alternative to Landlord's remedies under Section 19(a) above,
             Landlord may, without terminating this Lease, reenter the Premises
             by summary proceedings or otherwise, and in any event may
             dispossess Tenant, removing all persons and property from the
             Premises and such property may be removed and stored in public
             warehouse or elsewhere at the cost of, and for the account of
             Tenant, all without service of notice or resort to legal process
             and without being deemed guilty of trespass, or becoming liable for
             any loss or damage which may be occasioned thereby. In the event of
             such reentry, Landlord shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
             relet the Premises to such tenant or tenants for such term or terms
             as Landlord may elect, without being obligated to do so, and in the
             event of a reletting shall apply the rent therefrom first to the
             payment of Landlord's expenses, including reasonable solicitor's
             fees incurred by reason of


                                       30

<PAGE>


             Tenant's default, and the expense of reletting including but not
             limited to the repairs, renovation or alteration of the Premises,
             and then to the payment of rent and all other sums due from Tenant
             hereunder. Tenant shall remain liable for any deficiency. Such
             deficiency shall be calculated and paid monthly by Tenant. No such
             reentry or taking possession of the Premises by Landlord shall be
             construed as an election on its part to terminate this Lease unless
             a written notice of such intention be given to Tenant or unless the
             termination thereof be decreed by a court of competent
             jurisdiction. Notwithstanding any such reletting without
             termination, Landlord may at any time thereafter elect to terminate
             this Lease for such previous breach. In addition, Landlord may, as
             agent of Tenant, do whatever Tenant is obligated to do by the
             provisions of this Lease and may enter the Premises in accordance
             with applicable laws, without being liable to prosecution or any
             claim for damages therefor, in order to accomplish this purpose.
             Tenant agrees to reimburse Landlord immediately upon demand for any
             expenses which Landlord may incur in thus effecting compliance with
             this Lease on behalf of Tenant, and Tenant further agrees that
             Landlord shall not be liable for any damages resulting to Tenant
             for such action. If the Landlord at any time terminates this Lease
             for any breach, in addition to any other remedies it may have, it
             may recover from the Tenant all damages it incurs by reason of the
             breach including the costs of recovering the Premises, reasonable
             solicitors' fees (on a solicitor and his client basis) and
             including the worth at the time of the termination, of the excess,
             if any, of the amount of Rent and charges equivalent to Rent
             required to be paid under this Lease for the remainder of the
             stated Term over the then reasonable rental value of the Premises
             for the remainder of the stated Term. All of the mentioned amounts
             will be immediately due and payable by the Tenant to the Landlord.
             In addition to the foregoing rights, the full amount of the current
             month's instalment of Basic Rent and Additional Rent together with
             the next three (3) months' instalments of Basic Rent and Additional
             Rent, all of which will be deemed to be accruing on a day-to-day
             basis, will immediately become due and payable as accelerated Rent.


         (c) If legal action is brought for recovery of possession of the
             Premises, for the recovery of Rent or any other amount due under
             this Lease, or because of the breach of any other terms, covenants
             or conditions contained in this Lease on the part of the Tenant to
             be kept or performed, and a breach is established, the Tenant will
             pay to the Landlord all the expenses incurred in connection with
             it, including a reasonable solicitor's fee (on a solicitor and his
             client basis), unless a court otherwise awards.


         (d) In addition to its other rights and remedies, the Landlord, if the
             Tenant defaults under this Lease, may remedy or attempt to remedy
             the default of the Tenant and in so doing may make any payments due
             or alleged to be due by the Tenant to third parties and may enter
             upon the Premises to do any work or other things on them in which
             case all the Landlord's reasonable costs and expenses will be
             payable together with a fee of ten percent (10%) of all those costs
             and expenses representing the Landlord's overhead, as Additional
             Rent on demand. Subject to


                                       31

<PAGE>

             Section 14 the Landlord will not be liable for any Claims resulting
             from any action or entry by the Landlord under this Section and
             will not be considered to have breached any covenant for quiet
             enjoyment.

         (e) Mention in this Lease of any particular remedy of the Landlord for
             a default or Event of Default by the Tenant does not preclude the
             Landlord from any other remedy in respect of it. No remedy will be
             exclusive or dependant upon any other remedy but the Landlord may
             from time to time exercise one or more of its remedies generally or
             in combination, those remedies being cumulative and not
             alternative. The Tenant will not apply for injunctive relief and
             this provision may be pleaded as an estoppel in any proceedings
             taken by the Tenant to obtain injunctive relief.

         (f) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 19, if and
             only if: (i) one or more events of default specified in subsection
             (iii) to (viii) of Section 19(a) (hereinafter referred to as the
             "LIMITED REMEDY DEFAULTS") has occurred and is continuing and has
             not been waived in writing by the Landlord; and (II) no event of
             default specified in subsection (i) or (ii) of Section 19(a) has
             occurred (hereinafter "UNLIMITED REMEDY DEFAULTs"), and if --- the
             Landlord elects to pursue its remedies under the provisions of this
             Section 19, then the maximum amount of Rent damages that the
             Landlord shall be entitled to recover from the Tenant during the
             pendency of such Limited Remedy Default from and after the date of
             the occurrence of such Limited Remedy Default (the "OCCURRENCE
             DATE") with respect to Rent, shall be limited to the amount Basic
             Rent to be paid after the Occurrence Date for the unexpired portion
             of the Term of the Lease as provided herein as if this Lease had
             not expired or been terminated, discounted at an annual rate of
             7.00%.

20.      SUBROGATION

         As contemplated by Section 14 hereof, neither Landlord nor Tenant shall
         be liable to the other for the loss arising out of damage to or
         destruction of the Building, or the contents of any part thereof, when
         such loss is caused by any of the perils which are or could be included
         within or insured against by a standard form of fire insurance with
         extended coverage, including sprinkler leakage insurance, if any. All
         such claims for any and all loss, however caused, are hereby waived.
         Said absence of liability shall exist whether or not the damage or
         destruction is caused by the negligence of either Landlord or Tenant or
         by any of their respective agents, servants or employees. It is the
         intention and agreement of Landlord and Tenant that the rent reserved
         by this Lease have been fixed in contemplation that each party shall
         fully provide its own insurance protection at its own expense, and that
         each party shall look to its respective insurance carriers for
         reimbursement of any such loss, and further, that the insurance
         carriers involved shall not be entitled to subrogation under any
         circumstances against any party to this Lease. Neither Landlord nor
         Tenant shall have any interest or claim in the others insurance policy
         or policies, or the proceeds thereof unless specifically covered
         therein as a joint insured.


                                       32

<PAGE>

21.      MORTGAGE SUBORDINATION

         (a) Subordination. This Lease shall be subject and subordinate to any
             ground lease, mortgage, deed of trust, or other hypothecation or
             mortgage (collectively, "Mortgage") now or hereafter placed by
             Landlord upon the real property of which the Premises are a part,
             to any and all advances made on the security thereof and to all
             renewals, modifications, consolidations, replacements and
             extensions thereof. Tenant agrees that any person holding any
             Mortgage shall have no duty, liability or obligation to perform any
             of the obligations of Landlord under this Lease. In the event of
             Landlord's default with respect to any such obligation, Tenant will
             give any Lender, whose name and address have previously in writing
             been furnished Tenant, notice of a default by Landlord. Tenant may
             not exercise any remedies for default by Landlord unless and until
             Landlord and the Lender shall have received written notice of such
             default and a reasonable time (not less than ninety (90) days)
             shall thereafter have elapsed without the default having been
             cured. If any Lender shall elect to have this Lease superior to the
             lien of its Mortgage and shall give written notice thereof to
             Tenant, this Lease shall be deemed prior to such Mortgage. The
             provisions of a Mortgage relating to the disposition of
             condemnation and insurance proceeds shall prevail over any contrary
             provisions contained in this Lease.

         (b) Attornment. Subject to the non-disturbance provisions of
             subparagraph (c) of this Paragraph 21, Tenant agrees to attorn to a
             Lender or any other party who acquires ownership of the Premises by
             reason of a foreclosure of a Mortgage. In the event of such
             foreclosure, such new owner shall not: (i) be liable for any act or
             omission of any prior landlord or with respect to events occurring
             prior to acquisition of ownership, (ii) be subject to any offsets
             or defenses which Tenant might have against any prior Landlord, or
             (iii) be liable for security deposits or be bound by prepayment of
             more than one month's rent.

         (c) Non-Disturbance. With respect to a Mortgage entered into by
             Landlord concurrent with or after the execution of this Lease,
             Tenant's subordination of this Lease shall be subject to receiving
             assurance (a "non-disturbance agreement") from the Mortgage holder
             that Tenant's possession and this Lease will not be disturbed so
             long as Tenant is not in default and attorns to the record owner of
             the Premises.

         (d) Self-Executing. The agreements contained in this Paragraph 21 shall
             be effective without the execution of any further documents;
             provided, however, that upon written request from Landlord or a
             Lender in connection with a sale, financing or refinancing of
             Premises, Tenant and Landlord shall execute such further writings
             as may be reasonably required to separately document any such
             subordination or non-subordination, attornment and/or
             non-disturbance agreement as is provided for herein. Landlord is
             hereby irrevocably vested with full power to subordinate this Lease
             to a Mortgage.


                                       33

<PAGE>

If Landlord shall notify Tenant of the placing of any mortgage against the
Project, Tenant agrees that in the event of any act or omission by Landlord or
any other occurrence which would give Tenant the right to terminate this Lease,
to claim a partial or total eviction, or to reduce any rent payments hereunder,
Tenant shall not exercise any such right until: (a) it has notified in writing
the holder of any mortgage which at the time shall be a lien on the Premises and
of which it has notice, of such act or omission; (b) a reasonable period, for
commencing the remedying of such act or omission shall have lapsed following the
giving of such notice; and (c) Tenant or such holder, with reasonable diligence,
shall not have so commenced and continue to remedy such act or omission or cause
the same to be remedied.

22.      SIGNS AND ADVERTISEMENTS

         Tenant shall have the right to install at the entrance to the Premises,
at Tenant's sole cost and expense, signage which has been approved by Landlord
in writing; provided, however, that Landlord's approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld and in compliance with all applicable laws, ordinances,
regulations, and the like of every applicable governmental authority. If the
Premises have a rear service door (intended for deliveries or shipping), Tenant
shall have the right to install, at its sole cost and expense, signage which has
been approved by Landlord in writing; provided, however, that Landlord's
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld and in compliance with all
applicable laws, ordinances, regulations, and the like of every applicable
governmental authority. Notwithstanding the foregoing, signage which is covered
by the signage allowance referred to in Section 3 hereof shall be at the
Landlord's sole cost and expense.

23.      LANDLORD'S RIGHT OF ENTRY

         Landlord or Landlord's agent may enter the Premises upon twenty four
(24) hours prior notice (except in cases of emergency where no notice is
required), to examine the same and to do anything Landlord may be required to do
hereunder or which Landlord may deem necessary for the good of the Premises or
the Project. Landlord is not required to give notice to Tenant in the case of a
bona fide emergency. During the last six (6) months of the Lease Term, Landlord
may display signage on, and show the Premises.

24.      EFFECT OF TERMINATION OF LEASE

         No termination of this Lease prior to the stated termination date
thereof, by lapse of time or otherwise, shall affect Landlord's right to collect
rent for the period prior to termination hereof.

25.      NO ESTATE IN LAND - INTENTIONALLY DELETED

26.      HOLDING OVER

         Tenant has no right to retain possession of the Premises or any part
thereof beyond the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease. If Tenant
holds over with the consent of Landlord it shall be as a monthly tenant: (i) the
Base Rent payable shall be increased to 125%


                                       34

<PAGE>

of the Base Rent applicable during the month immediately preceding such
expiration or earlier termination; (ii) Tenant's right to possession shall
terminate on thirty (30) days notice from Landlord and (iii) all other terms and
conditions of this Lease shall continue to apply. Nothing contained herein shall
be construed as a consent by Landlord to any holding over by Tenant. Tenant
shall indemnify, defend and hold Landlord harmless from and against any and all

         The rights and remedies of Landlord under this Lease as well as those
provided or accorded by law, shall be cumulative, and shall be exclusive of any
other rights or remedies hereunder or allowed by law. A waiver by Landlord of
any breach(s) or default(s) of Tenant hereunder shall not be deemed or construed
to be a continuing waiver of such breach(s) or default(s) nor as a waiver of or
permission, expressed or implied, for any subsequent breach(s) or default(s),
and it is agreed that the acceptance by Landlord of any rent payment subsequent
to the date the same should have been paid hereunder, shall in no manner alter
or affect the covenant and obligation of Tenant to pay subsequent installments
of rent promptly upon the due date thereof. No receipt of money by Landlord
after the termination of this Lease in any manner shall reinstate, continue or
extend the Lease Term or reinstate this Lease in any manner.

the purpose of mailing or delivering notices to Tenant. A copy of all notices
required or permitted to be given to Landlord hereunder shall be concurrently
transmitted to such party or parties at such addresses as noted below Landlord's

               rights set out in this Section 43, the Common Areas are

               the foregoing to be considered constructive or actual eviction,
               or a breach of quiet enjoyment.

         (iii) When any change or other event described in this section has been
               affected, the term "Leased Premises" as used herein shall refer
               to the Premises as altered by such change or event and the term

account of the earliest stipulated Basic Rent, nor is any endorsement or
statement on any cheque or any letter accompanying any cheque or payment as Rent
to be considered an acknowledgement of full payment or an accord and
satisfaction, and the Landlord may accept payment and cash cheques without
prejudice to the Landlord's right to recover the balance of the Rent or pursue
its other remedies.

authorizing the Landlord to execute on behalf of and in the name of the Tenant

                obligations hereunder discharged, mitigated, impaired or
                affected in any way whatsoever, save and except in respect of
                any termination of the Lease as a result of the Landlord's
                default;

         (x)    the expiration of the Term; or

         (xi)   any Early Termination (as defined in Section 4 hereof), or any
                other termination of the Lease by operation of law or otherwise.

3. In the event of a default under the Lease or under this Indemnity, the
Indemnifier waives any right to require the Landlord to:

         (i)    proceed against the Tenant or any other person or pursue any
                rights or remedies against the Tenant with respect to the Lease;

         (ii)   proceed against or exhaust any security of the Tenant or any
                other person held by the Landlord;

         (iii)  pursue any other remedy whatsoever in the Landlord's power; or

         (iv)   grant to the Indemnifier any right to occupy the Premises or
                enjoy the balance of the Term of the Lease or any other benefits
                under the Lease;


                                       44

<PAGE>

         (v)    subrogate the Indemnifier to any rights of the Landlord
                whatsoever; in consideration for performance of its obligations
                under this Agreement.

         The Landlord has the right to enforce this Indemnity regardless of the
acceptance of additional security from the Tenant or any other person and
regardless of any release or discharge of the Tenant by the Landlord or by
others or by operation of any law.

         Provided however the Landlord will provide notice of any Tenant default
or of any settlement as referred to in Section 12 hereof.

4.       Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the liability of the
Indemnifier under this Indemnity is not and shall not be waived, released,
discharged, impaired or affected by reason of the release or discharge of the
Tenant in any receivership, bankruptcy, winding up or other creditors'
proceedings or the rejection, disaffirmance or disclaimer of the Lease in any
proceeding and shall continue with respect to the periods prior thereto and
thereafter, for and with respect to the Term as if the Lease had not been
rejected, disaffirmed or disclaimed, and in furtherance hereof, the Indemnifier
agrees, upon any Early Termination (as hereinafter defined), that the
Indemnifier shall, at the option of the Landlord, enter into a new lease with
the Landlord upon the same terms and conditions as are contained in the Lease,
applied mutatis mutandis for the unexpired remainder of what would have been the
Term but for the Early Termination. The liability of the Indemnifier shall not
be affected by any repossession of the Premises by the Landlord, provided,
however, that the net payments received by the Landlord after deducting all
costs and expenses of repossessing and reletting the Premises shall be credited
from time to time by the Landlord against the indebtedness of the Indemnifier
hereunder and the Indemnifier shall pay any balance owing to the Landlord from
time to time immediately upon demand. For the sake of clarity, the Landlord
shall be entitled to enforce this Indemnity in the event of a disclaimer,
disaffirmance, repudiation, rejection or termination of the Lease (as a result
of court proceedings or otherwise), or a surrender of the Lease, which the
Landlord did not accept in writing, which occurs prior to the originally
specified expiry date of the Term or renewal or extension (an "EARLY
TERMINATION"). Nothing but payment and satisfaction in full of all Rent and all
other amounts and the due performance and observance of all terms, covenants and
conditions on the part of the Tenant to be paid and performed shall release the
Indemnifier of its obligations hereunder.

5.       The Indemnifier hereby expressly waives notice of the acceptance of
this Indemnity. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, any notice
which the Landlord desires to give to the Indemnifier shall be sufficiently
given if delivered in person to the Indemnifier or if mailed by prepaid
registered or certified post addressed to the Indemnifier at the Premises, and
every such notice is deemed to have been given upon the day it was so delivered
in person, or if mailed, four (4) business days after it was mailed. The
Indemnifier may designate by notice in writing a substitute address for that
set forth above and thereafter notices shall be directed to such substitute
address.

                                       45

<PAGE>

6.       No action brought under this Indemnity and no recovery in pursuance
thereof shall be a bar or defence to any further action which may be brought by
reason of any further default hereunder or in the observance of the terms of the
Lease.

7.       No modification of this Indemnity shall be effective unless it is in
writing and is executed by both the Indemnifier and the Landlord.

8.       All of the terms, covenants and conditions of this Indemnity extend to
and are binding upon the Indemnifier, his heirs, executors, administrators,
successors and assigns, and shall enure to the benefit of and may be enforced by
the Landlord, its successors and assigns, as the case may be, and any mortgagee,
chargee, trustee under a deed of trust or other encumbrancer of all or any part
of the lands referred to in the Lease. Wherever in this Indemnity reference is
made to either the Landlord or the Tenant, the reference is deemed to apply also
to the respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns and
permitted assigns, respectively, of the Landlord and the Tenant, as the case may
be, named in the Lease. Any assignment by the Landlord of any of its interest in
the Lease operates automatically as an assignment to such assignee of the
benefit of this Indemnity.

9.       The expressions "Landlord", "Tenant", "Rent", "Term", and "Premises"
and other terms or expressions where used in this Indemnity, respectively, have
the same meaning as in the Lease.

10.      If two or more individuals, corporations, partnerships or other
entities are parties to this Indemnity as the Indemnifier:

         (i)   The liability of each such individual, corporation, partnership
               or other entity to pay amounts and perform all other obligations
               hereunder shall be joint and several;

         (ii)  each such individual, corporation, partnership and other entity
               hereby agrees with the Landlord that the Landlord may wholly or
               partially discharge one or more of them by release or by accord
               and satisfaction from its obligations hereunder and such of them
               as are not so discharged shall remain as fully liable for the
               performance of the obligations of the Tenant hereunder as if such
               of them not so discharged were the only persons originally
               comprising the Indemnifier hereunder, and that the foregoing
               shall be applicable notwithstanding any rule or principle of law
               to the contrary.

In the case of each partnership or other entity comprising the Indemnifier the
members of which are by virtue of statute or general law, subject to personal
liability, the liability of each such member shall be joint and several. The
receivership, bankruptcy, winding up or other creditors' proceedings of any one
of the partners or the partnership that comprises the Indemnifier shall not
affect the right of the Landlord to enforce this Indemnity against the other
partner or the partnership.

                                       46

<PAGE>

12.      The Indemnifier shall be bound by any account settled between the
Landlord and the Tenant with respect to the Premises.

13.      In the event that the Lease is disclaimed or terminated, the provisions
of this Indemnity shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with its
terms to the same extent as if this Indemnity had been a separate agreement
entered into between the Landlord and the Indemnifier for due consideration and
under seal.

14.      Notwithstanding any amendments to the Lease or any changes,
improvements or alterations to the Premises or to the Project the Indemnifier
shall continue to be bound by all of its obligations pursuant hereto to the
extent of what would have been its obligations pursuant hereto had such
amendments or such improvements or alterations not been made.

15.      This Indemnity shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the
Province in which the building is located.

16.      This Indemnity may be executed in any number of counterparts with the
same effect as if all parties had signed the same document. All counterparts
shall be construed together and shall constitute one and the same agreement.
Execution of this Indemnity may be made by any party by facsimile. Such
execution shall be deemed to be received on the day it was sent by facsimile if
it was sent before 4:00 pm on a business day in the jurisdiction in which the
recipient is located, or on the next business day following if sent after 4:00
pm on a business day in the jurisdiction in which the recipient is located.
Original documents shall be circulated by Landlord no later than forthwith upon
receipt of all counterparts by the Landlord; thereafter, the parties shall
forthwith execute and provide to Landlord such executed original documents.

1.       OPTIONS TO EXTEND

         Subject to the following terms hereof, the Tenant shall be entitled to
         extend the term of this Lease for two (2) further and consecutive
         periods of five (5) years each (with the first (the "FIRST EXTENSION
         TERM") commencing on the day after the expiry date of the original Term
         of this Lease, and each an "EXTENSION TERM"), provided that, as
         preconditions to the Tenant exercising such right, the Tenant shall:

         (i)      not then be in default;

         (ii)     have given written notice to the Landlord of the exercise of
                  this option at least nine (9) months prior to the expiry of
                  the immediately preceding original Term or Extension Term, as
                  the case may be.

         Each such Extension Term shall be on the terms and conditions set out
in this Lease, save and except that:

         (a)     there shall be no further or other right of extension or
                 renewal beyond the second Extension Term;

         (b)     the Premises shall be taken on an "as is" basis and there shall
                 be no rent-free or fixturing periods, and no allowances or
                 inducements;

         (c)     the Basic Rent shall be in such amount as the Landlord and the
                 Tenant may agree, based on fair market value rent for the
                 Premises; and

         (d)     the Tenant shall enter into an agreement prepared by the
                 Landlord to give effect to the terms of such extension.

         In the event that the Landlord and the Tenant are unable to agree upon
         the Basic Rent to be paid by the Tenant during an Extension Term by a
         date which is sixty (60) days after the notice is delivered, then the
         Tenant shall be entitled to terminate the Lease during


                                       53

<PAGE>


         such sixty (60) day period effective on the expiry date. If the Tenant
         does not elect to terminate within such time period, then such Basic
         Rent shall be determined in accordance with Section 2 hereof.

2.       ARBITRATION

         Provided the Tenant has given to the Landlord proper written notice of
         the Tenant's intention to extend this Lease as required above and the
         Tenant has not exercised its option to terminate the Lease in
         accordance with the requirements of section 1, and provided the
         Landlord and Tenant do not agree in writing on the Basic Rent for the
         Extension Term on or before the date ninety (90) days prior to the date
         of completion of the original Term or First Extension Term, as the case
         may be, then the Basic Rent for the relevant Extension Term shall be
         determined in accordance with the following additional terms and
         conditions:

         (i)     The Basic Rent shall be determined by a single arbitrator. The
                 Tenant shall by written notice to the Landlord given not more
                 than ninety (90) days and not less than sixty (60) days prior
                 to the date of completion of the original Term of the Lease,
                 propose the name of the person that it wishes to be the single
                 arbitrator. Within five (5) days thereafter, the Landlord shall
                 give notice to the Tenant advising whether the Landlord accepts
                 the arbitrator proposed by the Tenant. If such notice is not
                 given within such five (5) day period, the Landlord shall be
                 deemed to have accepted the arbitrator proposed by the Tenant.
                 If the parties cannot agree on a single arbitrator, then, upon
                 the application of either party, a justice of the superior
                 court of the Province of Ontario shall forthwith appoint an
                 arbitrator whose sole determination shall be final. The
                 arbitrator shall be a disinterested person of recognized
                 competence in the real estate business in the city in which the
                 Leased Premises are situated.

         (ii)    The Basic Rent for the Extension Term shall be the then current
                 fair market rates at the time of arbitration for uses the same
                 as or similar to the Tenant's use in similar locations and in
                 premises similar to the Premises taking into account the value
                 of any leasehold improvements.

         (iii)   The decision of the single arbitrator shall be final and
                 binding upon the Landlord and the Tenant only with respect to
                 Basic Rent.

         (iv)    All documents and proceedings with respect to the arbitration
                 are to be kept confidential.

         (v)     The expense of the arbitration shall be borne equally between
                 the parties hereto and the Tenant's share of such expense shall
                 be due and payable immediately upon receipt as Additional Rent


                                       54

         (vi)    The arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the
                 provisions of the Arbitration Act (Ontario) and any amendments
                 thereto, or of any successor statute thereof in force at the
                 time of the arbitration.


3.       FIRST TWENTY FOUR (24) MONTH RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL

         During the first twenty four (24) months of the Term, provided the
         Tenant is not and has never been in default under the terms of this
         Lease and is itself in occupation of the Premises and conducting its
         business in the whole of the Premises in accordance with the terms of
         this Lease, the Landlord shall give to the Tenant a continuing first
         right of refusal (the "RIGHT") to lease the balance of the Building or
         any part thereof which may be available for lease to a third party
         tenant, which available space is presently approximately one hundred
         and seventy three thousand (173,000) square feet of Rentable Area (the
         "SPACE", as same may be available at the relevant time). At any time
         prior to the Landlord receiving any offer to lease the Space, the
         Tenant shall be entitled to notify the Landlord that it elects to lease
         the Space on the terms hereinafter provided. In addition, the Landlord
         shall give to the Tenant notice of any offer it receives to lease
         Space, which it is prepared to negotiate or accept, and the Tenant
         shall be entitled within five (5) business days of receiving Landlord's
         notice, to lease the Space in accordance with this Section 3. If Tenant
         fails to elect to lease the Space within such five (5) business day
         period, then Landlord shall be entitled to lease the Space to a third
         party. If the Tenant either elects to lease the Space after notice from
         the Landlord, or notifies the Landlord that it wishes to lease Space
         which is available for lease, then the lease of such Space shall be on
         the same terms and conditions as are contained in this Lease, save and
         except that:

         (i)     the Term of the lease for the Space shall be for the balance of
                 the Term of this Lease with the same expiry date;

         (ii)    during the first five (5) years of the Term (or partial part of
                 such five(5) year period taking into consideration the date
                 upon which the Right is exercised), the Tenant shall pay Basic
                 Rent at the rate of five dollars and fifty cents ($5.50) per
                 square foot of the Rentable Area of the Space;

         (iii)   during the next five (5) years of the Term, the Tenant shall
                 pay Basic Rent at the rate of six dollars and twenty seven
                 cents ($6.27) per square foot of the Rentable Area of the
                 Space;

         (iv)    during the last five (5) years of the Term, the Tenant shall
                 pay Basic Rent at the rate of seven dollars and fifteen cents
                 ($7.15) per square foot of the Rentable Area of the Space;

         (v)     the Landlord's work in respect of the Space shall be based on
                 the EGL specifications for the Premises as follows:

                 o  $50,000. landscape allowance for the Space

                 o  One percent (1%) finished office space with washrooms (1730
                    sq. ft.), it being understood that the Tenant shall be
                    entitled to a credit against the Basic Rent payable in
                    respect of the Space for the first month of the Term for
                    such Space to the extent that any lesser portion of the
                    Space is converted into office space

                 o  Forty Dollar ($40.00) per rentable square foot allowance for
                    one percent (1%) office space

                    with dock levelers, lights, bumpers etc. to match the Tenant

                 o  Fence extended to enclose the complete truck area

                 o  Concrete slab to Tenant standards or Landlord standard floor
                    if poured prior to Tenant executing documentation for the
                    Space and providing the first and last month's deposit as
                    hereinafter provided

                 o  Full height drywall demising wall between the Premises and
                    the Space, if required.

                 o  Asphalt paving in truck and parking areas to Landlord
                    standards

                 o  Concrete dolly pads at truck level doors

                 o  Excludes concrete shipping area

         (the "ALLOWANCE WORK"). Any Landlord's work in excess of the Allowance
         Work must be approved in writing by the Tenant, and once approved by
         the Tenant, will be paid by the Tenant to the Landlord within thirty
         (30) days after completion of the Landlord's work as Additional Rent.

         Receipt of notice in accordance with the foregoing within the relevant
         period shall constitute a binding offer between the Landlord and the
         Tenant to lease the Space in accordance with the terms of this Lease,
         as above amended and save for any rent free or fixturing periods and
         other allowances, and Tenant shall, within five (5) days thereafter,
         enter into a lease amending agreement with the Landlord, so that the
         Space is incorporated into the Premises, and shall provide to the
         Landlord a certified cheque or bank draft on account of the first and
         last months' Basic Rent and GST payable in respect of the Space, or
         portion thereof, as the case may be, as reasonably estimated by the
         Landlord to be payable. Thereafter the Landlord shall commence the
         Allowance Work in respect of the Space and shall endeavour to complete
         same as expeditiously as reasonable possible. All Rent shall commence
         to be payable for the Space immediately upon the Landlord notifying the
         Tenant that the Allowance Work in respect of the Space has been
         substantially completed. It is understood that Tenant's Right is a
         continuing right, so that if, by way of example, Space leased by the
         Landlord subsequently becomes available for lease by the Landlord
         during the twenty four (24) month period, same shall be subject to the
         Tenant's right hereunder.

4.       SECOND RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL

         After the first twenty four (24) months of the Term, provided the
         Tenant is not and has never been in default under the terms of this
         Lease and is itself in occupation of the Premises and conducting its
         business in the whole of the Premises in accordance with the terms of
         this Lease, the Landlord shall give to the Tenant a continuing first
         right of refusal (the "RIGHT") to lease any part of the Building which
         is available for lease to a third party tenant (the "SPACE"). Within
         five (5) Business Days of the Landlord receiving a bona fide third
         party offer to lease the Space which the Landlord is prepared to accept
         or negotiate, in its sole and absolute discretion, (the "OFFER"), the
         Landlord shall give to the Tenant notice and thereafter the Tenant
         shall have five (5) Business Days within which to notify the Landlord
         that it wishes to lease such Space. The Landlord and the Tenant shall
         then have a further fifteen (15) days within which to conclude their
         negotiations and execute a lease for the Space, in default of which the
         Landlord shall be free to lease the Space either pursuant to the Offer
         or otherwise. If the Tenant does not elect to exercise the Right with
         respect to the Space in writing as required herein, this Right with
         respect to the Space shall be null and void and of no further force or
         effect. The Tenant will be deemed not have exercised its Right unless
         the Landlord receives written notice from the Tenant of its intention
         to exercise its Right within the five (5) Business Day period provided
         for herein and Tenant having, within ten (10) days thereafter, entered
         into a lease with the Landlord.

                                  SCHEDULE "D"

                             BUILD-TO-SUIT ADDENDUM

1.       Landlord shall use diligent and good faith efforts to cause the
         Premises to be constructed in accordance with the provisions of
         Sections 1 and 6 of the Lease on or before December 31, 2003.

2.       Landlord and Tenant have agreed upon the Plans attached hereto as part
         of this Schedule "D" (which cover the Premises but not the interior
         office space of the Premises).

3.       Selection of Architect and Contractor. Landlord has selected or
         plans to select an architect ("ARCHITECT") and contractor
         ("CONTRACTOR"). Tenant shall promptly submit to the Architect and/or
         Contractor any and all information reasonably requested by Architect
         and/or Contractor with respect to the Plans for the Building and
         Premises.

4.       Approval of Plans. Landlord shall cause the Architect and/or
         Contractor to deliver the Plans to the required governing authorities
         having jurisdiction over the Project. Any changes required by the
         governing authorities which unduly affect the Tenant's proposed use of
         the Premises shall require Tenant's approval, provided that Tenant
         shall not unreasonably withhold such consent so long as the changes do
         not require a material or substantial change or modification to the
         Plans approved by Tenant. If Tenant's approval is required, Landlord
         shall submit such plans reflecting such changes or modifications
         required by governing authorities (collectively, "MODIFICATIONS") to
         Tenant and within five (5) business days after Tenant receives the
         Modifications, Tenant shall either approve or disapprove the
         Modifications for reasonable and substantial or material reasons (each,
         a "DESIGN PROBLEM"). Landlord shall make such changes as are necessary
         in order to correct any Design Problem and shall resubmit the corrected
         Modifications to Tenant. Within five (5) business days after Tenant
         receives the revised Modifications, Tenant shall approve or disapprove
         the Modifications. This procedure shall be repeated until the
         Modifications are finally approved by Tenant. In the event that Tenant
         fails to provide written notice of disapproval within the required time
         period, the Modifications shall be deemed approved. In the event
         Landlord is required to seek Tenant approval, Landlord shall deliver
         copies of documents at the address required for notices under the
         Lease. In the event that Landlord, Tenant, and the governing
         authorities are unable to agree as to the resolution of a Design
         Problem or Modification within twenty one (21) days after the initial
         submission of such Modification to Tenant by Landlord, then an
         independent consultant, qualified to make a decision in respect of the
         particular Design Problem will be mutually agreed upon by the Landlord
         and the Tenant to resolve the issue, and such consultant's decision
         shall be binding upon the parties. Costs of any changes required by the
         governing authorities shall be at the Landlord's cost, save and except
         in respect of any additional landscaping costs, in excess of the
         landscaping allowance referred to herein, in respect of which the
         Tenant shall be responsible for two-thirds of such costs, it being
         understood that such


                                       58

<PAGE>

         contribution shall be subject to the same approval rights of the Tenant
         in respect of Modifications as set out above in this Section 4.

5.       Punch List. Tenant shall submit to Landlord, within fifteen (15) days
         after Tenant's occupancy of the Premises, a list of items which Tenant
         requests that Landlord repair or complete ("PUNCH LIST"). Punch list
         items shall not include damage or wear and tear caused by Tenant.
         Landlord hereby agrees to initiate repair or complete all such items
         set forth on Tenant's Punch List within a period of no more than
         forty-five (45) days following Landlord's receipt of Tenant's Punch
         List.

6.       Plan Modifications; Change Orders. Landlord and Tenant each recognizes
         that changes in the Plans may be necessary as construction proceeds on
         the Premises. However, any material modification (one which affects the
         Tenant's proposed use) to the Plans shall be mutually approved in
         writing by Tenant and Landlord. For any changes to the Plans hereafter
         requested by Tenant ("TENANT CHANGE ORDERS"), Landlord, within five (5)
         business days after receiving a request therefore, will advise Tenant
         of Landlord's or its Contractor's best estimate, which estimates are
         not binding on Landlord or the Contractor, of the number of days of
         delay that will be caused by such changes requested in such Tenant
         Change Order, any increase in cost associated with the implementation
         of such changes and any additional requirements necessary to
         accommodate the noted changes. Provided Tenant notifies Landlord to
         proceed with such changes within five (5) business days of Tenant's
         receipt of Landlord's notice as provided below, and Tenant agrees in
         writing: (A) to reimburse Landlord for Landlord's costs and expenses
         associated with such Building modification including, without
         limitation, the actual costs to construct such Building modifications
         and changes pursuant to such Tenant Change Order, and reasonable
         additional architectural and engineering fees; and (B) if applicable,
         to comply with Landlord's additional reasonable requirements; then
         Landlord will proceed to make such requested modifications to the
         Premises; provided, however, that all such added costs and expenses
         shall be Tenant's sole obligation and responsibility, and Tenant shall
         reimburse Landlord for all such additional costs and expenses of such
         modifications following Substantial Completion or on a monthly basis
         prior to Substantial Completion as determined by the Landlord as
         Additional Rent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Landlord shall not be
         obligated to proceed with any requested modifications to the Premises
         contained in a Tenant Change Order if Landlord in good faith determines
         that any such modification will adversely impact or jeopardize the
         Premises (including without limitation, the marketability thereof) or
         which would unreasonably delay the Substantial Completion of the
         Premises. Further, also as set forth above in the Lease, all delays in
         Substantial Completion that are the result of a Tenant Change Order
         shall not operate to extend the Rent Commencement Date. Further, all
         Tenant approvals as well as all Tenant Change Orders shall be made only
         upon written approval by the Senior Vice President of Corporate
         Administration of the Tenant (or such other person as designated in
         writing by the Senior Vice-President of Corporate Administration), or
         the same shall not be binding upon or effective as against Landlord.
