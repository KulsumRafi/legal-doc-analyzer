                         SAVINGS AND PROFIT SHARING PLAN

                             As Amended and Restated
                         Effective as of January 1, 2002

            The Liz Claiborne 401(k) Savings and Profit Sharing Plan

                            (As Amended and Restated
           Effective as of January 1, 2002 to Include EGTRRA Changes)


                                    Preamble

     Effective January 1, 1985, Liz Claiborne, Inc. (the "Company") adopted the
Liz Claiborne Savings Plan (the "Plan"), a stock bonus plan that provides for
contributions pursuant to section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended (the "Code"), which plan has been amended and restated from time to
time.

     Effective January 1, 1983, the Company adopted the Liz Claiborne Profit
Sharing Retirement Plan (the "Profit Sharing Plan"), a profit sharing plan that
provides for employer profit sharing contributions, which plan has also been
amended and restated from time to time.

     On June 9, 1999 the Company acquired approximately 85% of the stock of
Lucky Brand Dungarees, Inc. ("Lucky"), the sponsor of the Lucky Brand Employee
Retirement Plan and Trust (the "Lucky Plan"), a profit sharing plan providing
for contributions under section 401(k) of the Code.

     On June 11, 1999, the Company acquired approximately 85% of the stock of
Segrets, Inc. ("Segrets"), the sponsor of the Segrets, Inc. 401(k) Profit
Sharing Plan (the "Segrets Plan"), a profit sharing plan providing for
contributions under section 401(k) of the Code.

     On November 2, 1999 the Company acquired 100% of the stock of Podell
Industries, Inc., the sponsor of the Podell Industries, Inc. 401(k) Profit
Sharing Plan (the "Laundry Plan"), a profit sharing plan providing for
contributions under section 401(k) of the Code.

     Effective as of April 1, 2000, the Company amended and restated the Plan to
reflect the merger into it of the Profit Sharing Plan, the Lucky Plan, and the
Segrets Plan effective as of December 31, 1999 and the Laundry Plan effective as
of April 1, 2000; and (ii) to further amend the Plan to comply with the
provisions of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (also referred to as "GATT"), the
Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 ("USERRA"),
the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996 ("SBJPA"), the Taxpayer Relief Act
of 1997 ("TRA 97"), the Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act of
1998 ("RRA `98"), and the Community Renewal Tax Relief Act of 2000 ("CRA"),
(together, the "GUST provisions"), as well as other amendments determined by the

                                      - 1 -
<PAGE>

Company to be appropriate to further the purposes of the Plan, effective as of
the dates required by such provisions of law or as expressly set forth herein,
and otherwise as of the date hereof.

     Effective as of January 1, 2002, the Plan was amended and restated to make
additional GUST changes and to modify certain eligibility rules.

     The Plan is hereby further amended and restated effective as of January 1,
2002 to comply with the provisions of the Economic Growth and Tax Relief
Reconciliation Act of 2001 ("EGTRRA"), and to provide for other amendments
determined by the Company to be appropriate to further the purposes of the Plan,
effective as of the dates required by such provisions of law or as expressly set
forth herein, and otherwise as of the date hereof.

     The Plan as amended and restated herein is intended to qualify as a profit
sharing plan within the meaning of section 401(a) of the Code with a cash or
deferred arrangement within the meaning of section 401(k) of the Code.

                                   ARTICLE II

                                     Service

2.1 General. Service is used under the Plan to determine when an employee is
able to participate in the different types of contributions available under the
Plan and when he has earned a vested, nonforfeitable right to such
contributions. Service is determined differently for different purposes under
the Plan.

2.2 Year of Eligibility Service. An employee will have earned a "Year of
Eligibility Service" at the end of a twelve consecutive month computation period
during which the employee is credited with at least 1,000 Hours of Service; such
computation period shall begin on (a) the first day for which the employee is
paid or entitled to payment for the performance of duties for the Company or an
Affiliate or (b) any anniversary of such first day. The employee need not be
employed at the end of such computation period to be credited with a Year of
Eligibility Service.

2.3 Years of Vesting Service. An employee will have "Years of Vesting Service"
equal to the number of years, computed to a fraction based upon 365 days
comprising a year, elapsed since the first date for which the employee has an
Hour of Service and ending on the day he last severs employment with the Company
and its Affiliates, subject to the following:

     (a) An employee will have severed employment with the Company and its
     Affiliates on the earlier of (i) the day he quits, retires, dies or is
     discharged, or (ii) the first anniversary of the first day of an absence
     for any other reason.

     (b) If an employee's employment with the Company and its Affiliates is
     terminated and he incurs a One Year Break in Service, he shall not be
     credited with service for the period between the date he severed employment
     with the Company and its affiliates and the date, if any, of his
     reemployment by the Company or an Affiliate.

     (c) Any absence that is shorter than twelve full months shall count as
     vesting service.

     (d) The period between the first anniversary of the first day of a
     Maternity or Paternity Absence and the second anniversary shall be
     considered neither vesting service nor any part of a One Year Break in
     Service.

     (e) Vesting service earned by an employee after five (5) consecutive One
     Year Breaks in Service shall be disregarded in determining the vested
     percentage of his benefit under the Plan derived from Matching and Profit
     Sharing Contributions accrued prior to such break.

     (f) If an employee or Participant terminates employment with the Company
     and its Affiliates without having a vested interest in any portion of an
     Account and such employee or Participant incurs six (6) consecutive One
     Year Breaks in Service, his employment prior to the first such One Year
     break in Service shall be disregarded and he shall be treated as a new hire
     for purpose of when he may begin participation in the Plan and Section 3.1
     after his reemployment. The foregoing rule of parity shall not affect an

                                      - 9 -
<PAGE>

     individual's retention of his Years of Vesting Service earned prior to his
     reemployment by the Company or an Affiliate for purposes of determining his
     vested interest in any Employer contributions first allocated to his
     Account after his reemployment.

2.4 Changes in Employment Status and Application of Different Service Crediting
Rules to the Determination of Eligibility. In the event that an individual
changes status from a Full Time employee to a Part Time employee or vice-versa
(whether in connection with a termination of employment or otherwise) the
following rules shall apply:

     (a) an employee who moves from Part Time status to Full Time status shall
     be credited with the greater of (i) the period of elapsed-time service that
     would be credited under Section 2.3 during the entire computation period in
     which the transfer occurs or (ii) the service creditable under Section 2.2
     as of the date of transfer; and

     (b) An employee who moves from Full Time to Part Time status shall receive
     credit for Hours of Service in the computation period in which the transfer
     occurs for any elapsed time service earned prior to the date of transfer,
     determined by multiplying 45 by the number of weeks worked in any
     fractional part of a year credited under Section 2.3 prior to the transfer.

For purposes of the foregoing, the transfer will be deemed to have occurred on
the date the employee returns to work when the change in status occurs in
connection with an interruption of active employment.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an individual changes from Full Time to Part
Time status after he has received his initial enrollment kit, he will continue
to be treated as a Full Time employee for purposes of subparagraph 3.1(f)(i).

2.5 Service With Acquired Companies or Businesses. Notwithstanding the foregoing
provisions of this Article II, in the event that the Company or an Employer
acquires a business not previously included in the Company's "controlled group"
of businesses within the meaning of section 414 of the Code, the Committee in
its discretion may decide to recognize service with such business prior to the
acquisition as though it were service with an Affiliate, to the extent that, and
in accordance with such rules as, the Committee deems appropriate.

     thereof) has been extended by the Company or his Employer; for this purpose
     an Employer may, in its discretion, determine that employees in a specified

     Employer shall not be Eligible Employees, provided that no employee
     resident outside the continental United States shall be eligible to
     participate in the Plan regardless of the division, subdivision or other
     group to which such employee belongs unless the Senior Vice President,
     Human Resources of the Company expressly authorizes (in writing) the
     participation (or continued participation) in the Plan of persons resident
     in the location in which such employee resides or otherwise subject to the
     taxing authority of a particular jurisdiction or country other than the
     United States (including for this purpose Puerto Rico and any other United
     States territory with its own tax regime);

     (b) he does not perform services for the Company or an Employer under a
     contract, agreement, arrangement or understanding that purports to treat
     him as an independent contractor, a fragrance demonstrator or the employee
     of a leasing organization, agency or other entity, even if he is
     subsequently determined (by judicial action or otherwise) to have instead
     been a common law employee of such Employer;

     (c) his employment with the Company or his Employer is not covered by a
     collective bargaining agreement, unless participation in the Plan has been
     extended to him under the terms of such collective bargaining agreement;

     (d) he has attained age 21;

     (e) he is not a non-resident alien; and

     (f) he has satisfied the applicable service requirement for that portion of

     employee (that is, he is scheduled to work a full work week determined by
     the customary practice of his location, business unit or job description as
     determined by the Committee in its sole discretion), he has completed one
     half (1/2) of a Year of Vesting Service, or if he is a

                                     - 11 -
<PAGE>

     "Part Time" employee (that is, he is not a Full Time employee), he has
     completed a Year of Eligibility Service;

          (ii) with respect to Matching Contributions, if he is a Full Time
     employee, prior to January 1, 2002, he has completed a Year of Vesting
     Service (or has a Year of Eligibility Service for the computation period
     ending in the 2000 Plan Year) and after January 1, 2002, he has completed
     one-half (1/2) of a Year of Vesting Service, and if he is a Part Time
     employee, he has completed a Year of Eligibility Service;

          (iii) with respect to Profit Sharing Contributions, he has completed a
     Year of Eligibility Service, whether he is a Full Time or Part Time
     employee; and

          (iv) there is no service requirement for Rollover Contributions with
     respect to an otherwise eligible employee.

3.2 Transfer to Eligible Employment. If an employee transfers from a position
with an Employer or Affiliate that is not covered by the Plan to a position with
an Employer that is covered by the Plan, he shall become a Participant on the
later of (a) the first Entry Date coincident with or next following the date of
such transfer, or (b) the first Entry Date on which he could have become a
Participant pursuant to Section 3.1 if his prior employment by the Employer or
Affiliate had been in a position eligible for participation in the Plan.

3.3 Reemployment. If an employee who has terminated employment is rehired into
an eligible group, he shall commence or resume participation under the Plan on
the later of (a) the date of such rehire, or (b) the Entry Date coinciding with
or next following that date he satisfies all of the requirements of Section 3.1,
unless such employee is treated as a new hire for eligibility purposes under
paragraph 2.3(f), in which case he must again satisfy the service requirements
of paragraph 3.1(f).

3.4 Inactive Participation. If an individual ceases to meet all of the
eligibility requirements of Section 3.1, such individual shall be considered an
inactive Participant in the Plan for as long as any amount is credited to his
Account under the Plan, but:

     (a) no contributions shall be made by or for him; and

     (b) except as otherwise expressly provided herein, he may not make a
     withdrawal or borrow under Section X after he ceases to be an employee of
     an Employer or an Affiliate.

3.5 Transfers Between Employers. If a Participant transfers from employment as
an Eligible Employee with one Employer to employment as an Eligible Employee
with another Employer his participation in the Plan shall not be interrupted and
his Contribution Agreement (if any) with his prior Employer shall be deemed to
apply to his second Employer in the same manner as it applied to his prior
Employer.

3.6 No Employment Rights. The establishment of the Plan shall not be construed
as conferring any rights upon any employee or any person for a continuation of
his employment, nor shall it be construed as limiting in any way the right of
any Employer or Affiliate to

                                     - 12 -
<PAGE>

discharge any employee or to treat him without regard to the effect which such
treatment might have upon him as a Participant under the Plan.

3.7 Rollover Participation. An employee who satisfies all of the requirements of
Section 3.1 other than paragraphs (d) and (f) may make a Rollover Contribution
pursuant to Section 4.12 and thereby become a Participant as of the date of such
contribution (if he has not previously become a Participant) only for the
purposes of such Rollover, and shall not be eligible to share in Tax-Saver,
Matching or Profit Sharing Contributions until he has qualified for such
contributions in accordance with the applicable provisions of Section 3.1.

meaning of section 144(a)(3) of the Code) on a substantially full-time basis for

primary direction or control by the Recipient. A Leased Employee shall not be
eligible to participate in this Plan but, to the extent required by section
414(n) of the Code and applicable Treasury Regulations, such person shall be
treated as if the services performed by him in such capacity were performed by
him as an employee of a Controlled Group Member which has not adopted the Plan,
provided, however, that no such service shall be credited for any period during
which not more than 20% of the non-Highly Compensated Employees of the Company

                                   ARTICLE IV

                                  Contributions

4.1 Tax-Saver Contributions. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan,
including Article V, an Eligible Employee may elect to have his Compensation
reduced and a corresponding amount of Tax-Saver Contributions made on his behalf
for each payroll period beginning prior to January 1, 2003 in an amount equal to
any whole percentage of his Compensation for such payroll period between 1% and
15% inclusive. Effective for payroll periods beginning on and after January 1,
2003, an Eligible Employee who is not a Highly Compensated Employee may elect to
have his Compensation reduced and a corresponding amount of Tax-Saver
Contributions made on his behalf in an amount equal to any whole percentage of
his Compensation for such payroll period between 1% and 50% inclusive, and an
Eligible Employee who is a Highly Compensated Employee may make such an election
with respect to his Compensation in an amount equal to any whole percentage of
his Compensation for such payroll period between 1% and 8% inclusive. In each
such case a whole percentage of his Compensation shall not be required if
necessary or appropriate to comply with any applicable limitations on the amount
of Tax-Saver Contributions permitted. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Committee shall decrease the rate of a Participant's Tax-Saver Contributions for
any payroll period to the extent the amount of the corresponding reduction, plus
the amount of the Participant's deductions for such payroll period for welfare
benefits sponsored by the Employer and any other withholding from pay required
by law, would exceed the Participant's Compensation for such payroll period.

4.2 Contribution Agreement for Tax-Saver Contributions. Prior to April 1, 2000,
to become a Participant for purposes of Tax-Saver Contributions an Eligible
Employee must have completed and returned a Contribution Agreement. On and after
April 1, 2000, an Eligible Employee, upon first becoming eligible to make
Tax-Saver Contributions, shall be deemed to have completed a Contribution
Agreement under which he agrees to reduce the Compensation otherwise payable to
him in cash on each subsequent payroll date by 3% (or such other amount as the
Committee may specify on a uniform and nondiscriminatory basis); provided,
however, that any such individual may elect not to have such automatic
contributions made on his behalf, or to have contributions made in a different
amount, by providing such notification as the Committee may specify.

4.3 Time of Tax-Saver Contributions. Tax-Saver Contributions shall be
contributed by the Participant's Employer as soon as reasonably practicable
after the payroll date to which such contributions relate.

4.4 Change in Contribution Rate. Any Eligible Employee or Participant who
previously has declined to make Tax-Saver Contributions and any Participant who
has a Contribution Agreement in effect may prospectively increase or decrease
the percentage of Tax-Saver Contributions to be made on his behalf within the
limits specified in Section 4.1, effective as of a future payroll date, by
giving notice on the Appropriate Form to the Committee at least thirty (30) days
before such date or within such other period as the Committee may prescribe.

                                     - 14 -

4.5 Voluntary Suspension of Tax-Saver Contributions. A Participant may
voluntarily suspend his Contribution Agreement effective as of a future payroll
date by giving notice to the Committee on the Appropriate Form at least thirty
(30) days before such date or within such other advance period as the Committee
may prescribe. No Tax-Saver Contributions or Matching Contributions shall be
made for any Participant with respect to any period during which his
Contribution Agreement has been so suspended. An Eligible Employee may reinstate
his Contribution Agreement as of the first day of any payroll period, by giving
notice on the Appropriate Form at least thirty (30) days before the first day of
such payroll period (or within such other advance period as the Committee may
prescribe).

4.6 Mandatory Suspension of Tax-Saver Contributions. The Contribution Agreement
of a Participant who makes a hardship withdrawal from his Tax-Saver
Contributions Account pursuant to Section 8.3 shall be suspended as of the
payroll period in which the withdrawal is made until:

     (a) for withdrawals made prior to January 1, 2002, the next payroll period
     that is at least 12 months after the date of such withdrawal;

     (b) for withdrawals made on or after January 1, 2002, the next payroll
     period that is at least 6 months after the date of such withdrawal.

An Eligible Employee may reinstate his Contribution Agreement as of the first
day of any payroll period following a period of mandatory suspension under this
Section 4.6, by giving advance notice to the Committee on the Appropriate Form
so that it is received by the Committee within such period as the Committee
shall prescribe.

4.7 Matching Contributions. Matching Contributions shall be made with respect to
Tax-Saver Contributions in accordance with the following:

     (a) For each payroll period beginning on or after the Effective Date the
     Employers shall make Matching Contributions to the Plan for each
     Participant who had a Contribution Agreement in effect during such payroll
     period, in an amount equal to 50% of such Participant's Tax-Saver
     Contributions and, effective January 1, 2003, such Participant's Catch-up
     Contributions, as defined in Section 4.20 for such payroll period that do
     not exceed, in the aggregate, 6% of his Compensation for that payroll
     period.

     (b) Prior to the Effective Date, at the end of each calendar quarter, the
     Employers would determine whether the Matching Contributions made pursuant
     to paragraph (a) above on a payroll-by-payroll basis equal, for that
     calendar quarter, 50% of the Participant's Tax-Saver Contributions for that
     quarter that do not exceed 5% of his Compensation for that quarter or, if
     shorter, so much of the quarter during which he was a Participant. If the
     amount contributed under paragraph (a) did not equal the amount required by
     this paragraph (b), the Employers would contribute the additional amount
     necessary to make the Participant whole. No such true-up contribution shall
     be made with respect to any calendar quarter commencing on or after the
     Effective Date.

4.8 Payment of Matching Contributions. Matching Contributions made with respect
to a payroll period under paragraph 4.7(a) shall be paid to the Trustee as soon
as reasonably

                                     - 15 -
<PAGE>

practicable after the end of such period, and any true-up Matching Contributions
made under paragraph 4.7(b) for a quarter shall be made as soon as practicable
after such quarter, but in no event later than the due date (including
extensions) of the Employer's federal income tax return for the tax year to
which such contribution relates. Such Matching Contributions shall be allocated
to the Participant's Matching Contributions Account as of such Valuation Date
within the Plan Year as the Committee shall direct.

4.9 Matching Contributions Only For Permissible Tax-Saver Contributions. No
Matching Contributions shall be made with respect to (i) Excess Tax-Saver
Contributions (as defined in Section 5.8) distributable pursuant to Section 5.9,
(ii) Tax-Saver Contributions in excess of the elective deferral limit (as
defined in Section 5.4), or (iii) excess Annual Additions that are refunded
under Section 5.3. Any amounts paid into the Trust Fund with the intention that
they constitute Matching Contributions with respect to such amounts shall be
retained in the Trust Fund and applied to meet the obligation of the Employers
to make contributions under this Article IV.

4.10 Qualified Non-Elective Contributions. For each Plan Year, each Employer
shall contribute to the Trust Fund, in cash, such additional amounts (if any) as
the Committee, in its sole discretion, shall determine to be necessary or
desirable in order to meet the requirements of Sections 5.6 and 5.10 for such
Plan Year. Such additional contributions shall be made at such time as shall be
required by applicable Treasury Regulations. The Committee shall designate any
such amounts as "qualified non-elective contributions" (within the meaning of
section 401(m)(4)(C) of the Code) and shall determine the group of Eligible
Employees (who shall not be Highly Compensated Employees) eligible to share in
such Qualified Non-Elective Contributions, the method of apportionment under
which such Eligible Employees shall share in such contributions and the
Investment Funds in which such contributions shall initially be invested.
Anything in this Plan to the contrary notwithstanding, each Participant, at all
times, shall have a fully vested and nonforfeitable right to 100% of the amounts
in his Accounts attributable to Qualified Non-Elective Contributions, and such
contributions shall be treated as Tax-Saver Contributions for purposes of
determining when they may be distributed under the Plan, except that no such
amounts may be withdrawn prior to age 59 1/2 or separation from service, even on
account of hardship. At the direction of the Committee, Qualified Non-Elective
Contributions may be used to satisfy the Average Deferral Percentage test under
Section 5.6 or the Contribution Percentage test under Section 5.10 in accordance
with applicable Treasury Regulations.

4.11 Contributions for Military Service. Effective December 12, 1994,
notwithstanding any provisions of this Plan to the contrary, contributions
(including Profit Sharing Contributions) shall be made with respect to a period
in which an individual would have been a Participant but for his military
service to the extent required by Chapter 43 of Title 38 of the United States
Code (USERRA) and in accordance with section 414(u) of the Code. The amount of
any such Tax-Saver Contributions and of Matching Contributions in respect
thereof shall be based upon such individual's election made following his return
to employment with the Employer following such military service (and within the
time during which he had reemployment rights) in accordance with procedures
established by the Committee; provided that no such Tax-Saver Contributions may
exceed the amount the individual would have been permitted to elect to
contribute had the individual remained continuously employed by the Employer
throughout the period of such

                                     - 16 -
<PAGE>

military service (and Matching Contributions shall be limited accordingly). Such
contributions (and Profit Sharing Contributions) shall be taken into account as
Annual Additions for purposes of Section 5.2 in the Plan Year to which they
relate, and for purposes of applying the elective deferral limit set forth in
Section 5.4 in the Plan Year to which they relate, rather than in the Plan Year
in which made, and shall be disregarded for purposes of applying the limits
described in Sections 5.6 and 5.10. Any such contribution shall be made no later
than five years from the date of such return to employment or, if less, a period
equal to three times the period of such military service.

4.12 Rollovers. The Committee, in its sole discretion, may authorize Eligible
Employees to make Rollovers which qualify as rollover contributions under
applicable provisions of the Code. The Committee shall exercise such discretion
on a nondiscriminatory basis. All Rollovers shall be received and held in the
Trust Fund, and shall be credited to the Participant's Rollover Account as of
such date as the Committee shall specify.

4.13 Profit Sharing Contributions. For each Plan Year the Employers shall
contribute to the Trust Fund such amount (if any) as shall have been determined
by the Company. Such determination may be made at any time prior to the due date
(including extensions) of the Company's Federal income tax return for its fiscal
year ending with or within such Plan Year.

4.14 Eligibility to Share in Profit Sharing Contributions. A Participant shall
be eligible to share in Profit Sharing Contributions for a Plan Year only if (a)
he has completed at least 1,000 Hours of Service during the Plan Year and he is
employed by an Employer or Affiliate on the December 31 of such year (or on the
latest earlier date during such year which the Committee determines is necessary
or appropriate in order for the Plan to satisfy the requirements of Section
410(b) of the Code), or (b) during such Plan Year his employment ended after he
(i) died, (ii) reached his Normal Retirement Date, (iii) reached age 60 and
completed at least 6 Years of Vesting Service, (iv) completed at least 20 Years
of Vesting Service or (v) incurred a Disability.

4.15 Allocation of Profit Sharing Contributions and Forfeitures. Profit Sharing
Contributions for a Plan Year shall be allocated as of the last business day of
such year to the Profit Sharing Accounts of all Participants who are eligible to
share in such contributions, in the ratio that each such Participant's
Compensation for the Plan Year bears to the total Compensation of all such
Participants for that Plan Year. For this purpose, Compensation paid before the
day participation began for purposes of Section 4.14 shall not be taken into
account.

4.16 Contributions May Not Exceed Amount Deductible. In no event shall
contributions under this Article IV for any taxable year exceed the maximum
amount (including amounts carried forward) deductible for that taxable year
under section 404(a)(3) of the Code, and all such contributions are conditioned
on their deductibility.

4.17 Form of Payment to Trustee. Profit Sharing, Tax-Saver, Matching and
Qualified Non-Elective Contributions shall be made in cash; provided that, to
the extent Profit Sharing, Matching or Tax-Saver Contributions are to be
invested in the Company Stock Fund, the Employers may contribute shares of
Common Stock having a fair market value (determined as of the date such
contributions are to be allocated to the Participants' Accounts) equal to the
amount of the contributions so required. Shares so contributed may be authorized
but unissued shares,

                                     - 17 -
<PAGE>

treasury shares, shares purchased for the purpose of making such contribution,
or any combination of the foregoing. The Company is authorized to contribute
cash or Common Stock to the Plan on behalf of any other Employer, and to the
extent that the Company makes any such contribution, such Employer shall
reimburse the Company therefor.

4.18 Time of Payment of Profit Sharing Contribution. All Profit Sharing
Contributions shall be paid or delivered by the Employer to the Trustee by the
due date (including extensions) of the Employer's Federal income tax return for
its fiscal year to which such contributions relate.

4.19 Profits Not Required. Each Employer shall make all contributions to the
Plan without regard to current or accumulated earnings and profits.

4.20 Catch-Up Contributions. Effective January 1, 2003 and thereafter, all
employees who are eligible to make Tax-Saver Contributions under this Plan and
who have attained age 50 before the end of the Plan Year shall be eligible to
make catch-up contributions in accordance with, and subject to the limitations
of, section 414(v) of the Code ("Catch-up Contributions"). Catch-up
Contributions shall not be taken into account for purposes of the provisions of
the Plan implementing the required limitations of Code section 402(g) (Section
5.4) and Code section 415 (Section 5.2). The Plan shall not be treated as
failing to satisfy the provisions of the Plan implementing the requirements of
Code section 401(k)(3) (such as Section 5.6), 410(b), or 416 of the Code, as
applicable, by reason of the making of Catch-up Contributions. Catch-up
Contributions shall be made in accordance with uniform rules established by the
Committee.

                             Limits on Contributions

5.1 Reduction of Contribution Rates. To conform the operation of the Plan to
sections 401(a)(4), 401(k)(3), 401(m)(2), 402(g) and 415(c), the Committee may
establish limits on Tax-Saver Contribution rates that may be elected by the
Participant, may unilaterally modify or revoke a Contribution Agreement, and may
reduce the rate of Matching Contributions (even to zero) payable with respect to
a Participant or group of Participants.

5.2 Limitations on Annual Additions. Notwithstanding any other provisions of the
Plan to the contrary, a Participant's Annual Additions (as defined below) for
any Plan Year shall not exceed an amount equal to the lesser of:

     (a) $40,000 (as adjusted for cost-of-living increased under section 415(d)
     of the Code); or

     (b) 100 percent of the Participant's Total Earnings for that Plan Year,
     calculated as if each Section 415 Affiliate (defined below) were an
     Affiliate,

reduced by any Annual Additions for the Participant for the Plan Year under any
other defined contribution plan of an Employer or an Affiliate or Section 415
Affiliate, provided that, if any other such plan has a similar provision, the
reduction shall be pro rata. The term "Annual Additions" means, with respect to
any Participant for any Plan Year, the sum of all contributions allocated to a
Participant's Accounts under the Plan for such year, excluding Rollovers and any
Tax-Saver Contributions that are distributed as excess deferrals, but including
any Tax-Saver or Matching Contributions treated as excess contributions or
excess aggregate contributions under Sections 5.8 or 5.11. The term Annual
Additions shall also include employer contributions allocated for a Plan Year to
any individual medical account (as defined in section 415(l) of the Code) of a
Participant and any amount allocated for a Plan Year to the separate account of
a Participant for payment of post-retirement medical benefits under a funded
welfare benefit plan (as described in section 419A (d)(2) of the Code), which is
maintained by the Employer or an Affiliate or Section 415 Affiliate. "Section
415 Affiliate" means any entity that would be a Controlled Group Member if the
ownership test of section 414 of the Code was "more than 50%" rather than "at
least 80%".

5.3 Excess Annual Additions. If, as a result of a reasonable error in estimating
a Participant's Total Earnings, a reasonable error in determining the amount of
Tax-Saver Contributions that may be made with respect to a Participant under the
limits of section 415 of the Code or such other mitigating circumstances as the
Commissioner of Internal Revenue shall prescribe, the Annual Additions for a
Participant for a Plan Year exceed the limitations set forth in section 5.2, the
excess amounts shall be treated, as necessary, in accordance with Treasury
Regulations Section 1.415-6(b)(6)(ii), after any Tax-Saver Contributions, and
any income, losses, appreciation or depreciation attributable thereto, are first
returned to the Participant to reduce the excess amount. To the extent
applicable to the foregoing, reference to section 415(e) of the Code under prior
versions of this Plan or any other plan merged into this Plan shall be
disregarded effective January 1, 2000.

                                     - 19 -
<PAGE>

5.4 Limitation on Elective Deferrals. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Plan, no Tax-Saver Contributions may be made on behalf of any Participant
for a Plan Year in an amount in excess of the elective deferral limit for that
Plan Year. A Participant's Tax-Saver Contributions under Section 4.1 shall be
discontinued for the remainder of a Plan Year when, in the aggregate, they equal
the elective deferral limit for such Plan Year. For purposes of this Section
5.4, the "elective deferral limit" means the maximum amount permitted for that
Plan Year under section 402(g)(1) of the Code ($11,000 for the 2002 Plan Year),
reduced by the amount of elective deferrals (as defined in section 402(g)(3) of
the Code) made by the Participant during that calendar year under any plans or
agreements maintained by an Employer or by an Affiliate other than this Plan
(and, in the sole discretion of the Committee, any plans or agreements
maintained by any other employer, if reported to the Committee at such time and
in such manner as the Committee shall prescribe). For Plan Years prior to
January 1, 2002 the elective deferral limit with respect to a Participant who
has received a hardship withdrawal from his Tax-Saver Contributions Account
under this Plan as provided in Section 8.3, or a hardship withdrawal with
respect to his elective deferrals under any other plan or agreement of any
Employer or Affiliate, for his taxable year following the taxable year of such
withdrawal, shall be reduced by the amount of the elective deferrals made by the
Participant during the taxable year of the withdrawal under this Plan and all
such other plans and agreements. Each such other plan or agreement shall be
deemed amended by reason of this provision and the Participant's execution of
the Appropriate Form to the extent necessary to give full effect to any
reduction required under the preceding sentence.

5.5 Distribution of Excess Deferrals. If the elective deferrals made by a
Participant during his taxable year under this Plan and any other plans or
agreements maintained by an Employer or Affiliate exceed the elective deferral
limit, the excess Tax-Saver Contributions, adjusted for any income or loss
attributable to such Tax-Saver Contributions up to the date of distribution, in
the sole discretion of the Committee, may be distributed no later than April 15
of the following Plan Year. If the Participant's Tax-Saver Contributions Account
is invested in more than one Investment Fund, such distribution shall be made
pro rata, to the extent practicable, from all such Investment Funds. Any
Matching Contributions made with respect to such excess Tax-Saver Contributions
and allocated to his Matching Contributions Account shall be forfeited and used
to reduce Employer contributions. A Participant also may request that excess
Tax-Saver Contributions be distributed to him, by delivering a written claim to
the Committee by March 1 of the Plan Year of distribution. Such claim must
include (a) a statement that the Participant's elective deferral limit will be
exceeded unless the excess Tax-Saver Contributions are distributed and (b) an
acknowledgement that any Matching Contributions made with respect to such excess
Tax-Saver Contributions and allocated to his Matching Contributions Account will
be forfeited. The amount of excess deferrals to be distributed pursuant to this
Section 5.5 for a taxable year will be reduced by the amount of Excess
Contributions previously distributed with respect to such Participant for the
Plan Year beginning in such taxable year under Section 5.8.

5.6 Section 401(k) Limit on Tax-Saver Contributions. Notwithstanding anything in
this Plan to the contrary, effective January 1, 1997, Tax-Saver Contributions
for any Plan Year for a Participant who is a Highly Compensated Employee for
such year shall be reduced if and to the extent deemed necessary or advisable by
the Committee in order that the Average Deferral Percentage (as defined in
Section 5.7) for Participants who are Highly Compensated Employees for that Plan
Year shall not exceed the percentage determined in the following schedule, based

                                     - 20 -
<PAGE>

on the Average Deferral Percentage for that Plan Year for all Eligible Employees
who are not Highly Compensated Employees for that Plan Year:

                                        (1-1/4) times the
                                        percentage in Column 1


5.7 Determination of Average Deferral Percentages. For purposes of Section 5.6,
the "Average Deferral Percentage" for any group of individuals who are eligible
to enter into a Contribution Agreement for a portion of a Plan Year means the
average of the individual ratios, for each person in such group, of (a) his
Tax-Saver Contributions (and Qualified Non-Elective Contributions, if
applicable) for the Plan Year to (b) his Total Earnings for such Plan Year. The
individual ratios, and the Average Deferral Percentage for any group of eligible
individuals, shall be calculated to the nearest one-hundredth of one percent
(0.01%).

5.8 Treatment of Excess Tax-Saver Contributions. For purposes of this Section
5.8, "Excess Contributions" means, with respect to any Plan Year, a dollar
amount equal to the excess of (a) the aggregate amount of Tax-Saver
Contributions actually paid into the Plan on behalf of Highly Compensated
Employees for such Plan Year, over (b) the maximum amount of Tax-Saver
Contributions permitted for such Plan Year under the limitations set forth in
Section 5.6, determined by reducing the deferral percentages under the leveling
method prescribed in applicable Treasury Regulations and calculating the
aggregate dollar amount of lost contributions from such reductions. The
aggregate amount of such lost contributions shall be the Excess Contributions
for the Plan Year, which shall be distributed in cash to Highly Compensated
Employees on the basis of the respective amounts of Tax-Saver Contributions (and
amounts taken into account as Tax-Saver Contributions) made on their behalf,
reducing the Highly Compensated Employee with the largest amount of Tax-Saver
Contributions first, and the next highest and so forth, until the entire amount
of such Excess Contributions is distributed. Excess Contributions for a Plan
Year with respect to any Highly Compensated Employee shall be distributed in
cash no later than March 15 of the following Plan Year if possible, and in any
event by the close of such following Plan Year. If the Accounts of an affected
Participant are invested in more than one Investment Fund, such distribution
shall be made pro rata, to the

                                     - 21 -
<PAGE>

extent practicable, from all such Investment Funds. The amount of Excess
Contributions distributed to any such Participant shall be adjusted for any
income or loss attributable to such Excess Contributions up to the date of
distribution. The amount of Excess Contributions to be distributed for a Plan
Year (determined before adjustment for any income or loss allocable thereto)
shall be reduced by the amount of excess elective deferrals previously
distributed pursuant to Section 5.5 for the same Plan Year.

5.9 Section 401(k)(3) Testing for Collective Bargaining Unit Employees. The
provisions of Sections 5.6, 5.7 and 5.8 shall be applied separately to employees
in any collective bargaining unit participating in the Plan. If employees in
more than one bargaining unit are eligible under the Plan, the Committee, in its
discretion, may apply such provisions separately to each separate collective
bargaining unit, on an aggregate basis with respect to all collective bargaining
units, or separately with respect to such collective bargaining units or
combinations of bargaining units as it determines, provided that such treatment
is determined on a basis that is reasonable and reasonably consistent from year
to year.

5.10 Section 401(m) Limit on Matching Contributions. Notwithstanding anything in
this Plan to the contrary, effective January 1, 1997, Matching Contributions for
any Plan Year for an Eligible Employee who is a Highly Compensated Employee
shall be reduced to the extent necessary in order that the Contribution
Percentage (defined in Section 5.11) for Eligible Employees who are Highly
Compensated Employees for that Plan Year does not exceed the percentage
determined in the following schedule, based on the Contribution Percentage for
the Plan Year for all Eligible Employees who are not Highly Compensated
Employees:

(i) Less than 2%                        (i)  Two (2) times the percentage in
                                        Column 1

(ii) 2% - 8%                            (ii) The percentage in Column 1, plus 2%

(iii) More than 8%                      (iii) One and one-quarter (1-1/4) times
                                        the percentage in Column 1


The foregoing percentages in Column 2 shall be adjusted, as necessary, to
satisfy the aggregate limit set forth in Section 5.13.

5.11 Determination and Correction of Excess Matching Contributions. For purposes
of Section 5.10, the Contribution Percentage for any group of individuals means
the average of the individual ratios, for each person in such group who is
eligible to receive Matching Contributions during the Plan Year and who is not
covered by a collective bargaining agreement, of (a) his share of Matching
Contributions for the Plan Year to (b) his Total Earnings for the Plan Year. For
purposes of calculating part (a) of the Contribution Percentage, Qualified
Non-

                                     - 22 -
<PAGE>

Elective Contributions and Tax-Saver Contributions may be taken into account
in accordance with applicable Treasury Regulations to the extent such
contributions are not taken into account for purposes of the Average Deferral
Percentage test of Section 5.6. The individual ratios, and the Contribution
Percentage for any group of eligible individuals, shall be calculated to the
nearest one-hundredth of one percent (0.01%). If the Plan fails to meet the
section 401(m) test for a Plan Year. the total amount of excess Matching
Contributions shall be determined, and allocated to individuals within the
Highly Compensated Employee group using the same two-part leveling methodology
as that described in Section 5.8. Excess Matching Contributions shall be
eliminated by (a) forfeiting such amounts that are not vested or with respect to
which the related Tax-Saver Contributions have been returned under Section 5.5
or Section 5.8, or (b) if vested (and with respect to which the Plan has
retained the related Tax-Saver Contributions), by paying such contributions to
the Participant in cash no later than March 15 of the following Plan Year, if at
all possible, and in any event, no later than the close of the following Plan
Year. If any Account from which a distribution or forfeiture is to be made
pursuant to this Section 5.11 is invested in more than one Investment Fund, such
distribution or forfeiture shall be made pro rata, to the extent practicable,
from all such Investment Funds. The amount of excess Matching Contributions
distributed or forfeited under this Section 5.11 shall be adjusted for any
income or loss through to the date of distribution or forfeiture.

5.12 Special Testing Rules. The following rules shall apply to the tests
described in Sections 5.6 and 5.10.

     (a) Separate Testing for Early Eligibles. Effective for Plan Years
     beginning on or after January 1, 1999, if the Company elects to apply
     section 410(b)(4)(B) of the Code in determining whether the Plan meets the
     requirements of section 401(k)(3)(A)(i) of the Code, the Company in
     determining whether the Plan meets the limits of Section 5.6 and 5.10 may
     exclude from consideration Eligible Employees (other than Highly
     Compensated Employees) who have not yet met the minimum age and service
     requirements of Code section 410(a)(1)(A).

     (b) Multiple Arrangements for Highly Compensated Employees Combined. If
     more than one plan providing for a cash or deferred arrangement, or for
     matching contributions, or employee contributions (within the meaning of
     sections 401(k) and 401(m) of the Code) is maintained by the Employer or an
     Affiliate, the individual ratios of any Highly Compensated Employee who
     participates in more than one such plan or arrangement shall, for purposes
     of determining the Average Deferral Percentage (as defined in Section 5.7)
     and Contribution Percentage (as defined in Section 5.11), be determined as
     if all such arrangements were a single plan or arrangement.

     (c) Aggregation of Plans. In the event that this Plan satisfies the
     requirements of section 410(b) of the Code only if aggregated with one or
     more other plans, then Sections 5.6 and 5.10 shall be applied by
     determining the Average Deferral Percentage and Contribution Percentage of
     Eligible Participants as if all such plans were a single plan. Plans may be
     aggregated under this paragraph (c) only if they have the same plan year.

                                   ARTICLE VI

                          Accounts and Investment Funds

6.1 Accounts. The Committee shall cause the following "Accounts" to be
maintained in the name of each Participant:

     (a) a "Profit Sharing Contributions Account," which shall reflect Profit
     Sharing Contributions, if any, made on his behalf and the income, losses,
     appreciation, depreciation and depreciation and expenses attributable
     thereto;

     (b) a "Tax-Saver Contributions Account," which shall reflect Tax-Saver
     Contributions, if any, made on his behalf and the income, losses,
     appreciation, depreciation and expenses attributable thereto;

     (c) a "Matching Contributions Account," which shall reflect Matching
     Contributions made on his behalf and the income, losses, appreciation,
     depreciation and expenses attributable thereto;

     (d) a "Qualified Non-Elective Contributions Account," which shall reflect
     Qualified Non-Elective Contributions, if any, made on his behalf, and the
     income, losses, appreciation, depreciation and expenses attributable
     thereto;

     (e) a "Rollover Account," which shall reflect Rollover Contributions, if
     any, made by him and the income, losses, appreciation, depreciation and
     expenses attributable thereto;

     (f) a "Buy Back Account", which shall reflect any previously-distributed
     amounts returned by him upon his reemployment to avoid a forfeiture of the
     unvested portion of his Accounts in accordance with Section 7.5.

In addition, the Committee may maintain subaccounts within the Tax-Saver
Contributions Account to distinguish contributions eligible to be matched from
contributions above the matching limit, as well as subaccounts to reflect
balances transferred to this Plan from another qualified plan that are subject
to special rules. The Accounts and subaccounts provided for in this Section 6.1
shall be for accounting purposes only, and there shall be no segregation of
assets within the Investment Funds among the separate Accounts. Reference to the
"balance" in a Participant's Accounts means the aggregate of the balances in the
subaccounts maintained in the Investment Funds attributable to those Accounts.

6.2 Allocation of Contributions. Subject to the provisions of Article V,
contributions shall be allocated as follows:

     (a) Tax-Saver Contributions, Matching Contributions contributed with
     respect to payroll periods, Rollover Contributions and amounts paid back to
     avoid a forfeiture under Section 7.5 made on behalf of a Participant shall
     be allocated to that Participant's appropriate Accounts as of the Valuation
     Date coinciding with the paycheck or payment date to which such
     contribution relates.

                                     - 25 -
<PAGE>

     (b) Matching Contributions made with respect to a calendar quarter shall be
     allocated as of the last day of that quarter and Profit Sharing
     Contributions and Qualified Non-Elective Contributions for a Plan Year
     shall be allocated as of the last day of such Plan Year.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless the Committee establishes uniform rules to
the contrary, contributions made to the Plan shall share in the gains and losses
of the Investment Funds only when received by the Trustee with verified data.

6.3 Correction of Error. In the event of an error in the adjustment of a
Participant's Account, the Committee, in its sole discretion, may correct such
error by either crediting or charging the adjustment required to make such
correction to or against income and expenses of the Trust for the Plan Year in
which the correction is made or the Employer may make an additional contribution
to permit correction of the error. No Participant shall have a vested right to
any amounts erroneously credited to his Accounts. Except as provided in this
Section 6.3 the Accounts of other Participants shall not be readjusted on
account of such error.

6.4 Statement of Plan Interest. As soon as practicable after the last day of
each Plan Year and at such other intervals as the Committee may determine, the
Committee shall provide each Participant with a statement reflecting the
balances of his Accounts. Each Participant is responsible for reviewing his
statement and any Participant who discovers an error shall bring it to the
attention of the Committee within 90 days of receipt of his statement; after
such 90 days the Participant shall be deemed to have confirmed the accuracy of
the statement unless he has so notified the Committee of an error.

6.5 Investment Funds. The Committee shall establish and cause the Trustee to
maintain one or more "Investment Funds" or "Funds" for the investment of
Participants' Accounts. The Committee in its discretion may add additional
Investment Funds, may delete any Investment Fund or may change the investment
strategy or categories of permitted investments of any Investment Plan without
prior notice to Participants. One of the Investment Funds shall be a "Company
Stock Fund" invested in Common Stock and cash or cash equivalents held for
liquidity purposes.

6.6 Investment Fund Accounting. The Committee shall maintain or cause to be
maintained separate subaccounts for each Participant in each of the Investment
Funds to separately reflect his interest in each such Fund and the portion of
such interest that is attributable to each of his Accounts. The Committee, in it
sole discretion, may establish uniform rules for reporting the value of each
Participant's interest in an Investment Fund that has the effect of blending the
value of the cash or cash equivalents that comprise part of that Fund with the
value of the securities in which the Fund is primarily invested, as in "unit"
accounting.

6.7 Allocation of Fund Earnings and Changes in Value. As of each Valuation Date,
interest, dividends and changes in value and expenses of each Investment Fund
since the preceding Valuation Date shall be allocated to each Participant's
subaccounts invested in such Investment Fund by adjusting upward or downward the
balance of his subaccounts invested in such Investment Fund in the ratio which
the subaccounts of such Participant invested in such

                                     - 26 -
<PAGE>

Investment Fund bears to the total of the subaccounts of all Participants
invested in such Investment Fund as of such Valuation Date, excluding therefrom,
for purposes of this allocation only, all Tax-Saver, Matching, Profit Sharing,
Qualified Non-Elective and Rollover Contributions and amounts paid into Buy Back
Accounts received since the preceding Valuation Date, so that the total of the
subaccounts of all Participants in each Investment Fund shall equal the total
value of such fund (exclusive of such contributions) as determined by the
Trustee in accordance with uniform procedures consistently applied.

     The Plan shall use a daily valuation system, which generally shall mean
that Accounts will be updated each business day to reflect activity for that
day, such as new contributions received by the Trustee, changes in Participant's
investment elections, and changes in the value of the Investment Funds under the
Plan. Such daily valuation shall be dependent upon the Plan's Recordkeeper
receiving complete and accurate information from a variety of different sources
on a timely basis. Since events may occur that cause an interruption in this
process, affecting a single Participant or a group of Participants, there shall
be no guarantee by the Plan that any given transaction will be processed on the
anticipated day. In the event of any such interruption, any affected transaction
shall be processed as soon as administratively feasible and no attempt shall be
made to reconstruct events as they would have occurred absent the interruption,
regardless of the cause, unless the Committee in its sole discretion directs the
Plan's Recordkeeper to do so.

6.8 Investment Fund Elections. A Participant may specify the percentage of
contributions subsequently credited to his Accounts that are to be invested in
each of the Investment Funds in accordance with uniform rules established by the
Committee. Any such investment direction shall be deemed to be a continuing
direction until changed by the Participant. During any period in which no such
direction has been given in accordance with rules established by the Committee,
contributions credited to a Participant shall be invested in the Investment
Funds as determined by the Committee. A Participant may modify his investment
direction prospectively by making a new investment election prior to the
effective time of the change in accordance with uniform rules established by the
Committee, which rules may be modified from time to time without prior notice.

     The Plan is intended to satisfy the requirements of section 404(c) of ERISA
with respect to Participant's investment elections. To the extent permitted by
law, neither the Company, any Employer, the Committee, the Trustee nor any other
fiduciary of the Plan shall be liable for any loss resulting from a
Participant's exercise of his right to direct the investment of his Accounts.

6.9 Transfers Between Investment Funds. Subject to uniform rules established by
the Committee, each Participant may elect to transfer the value of his Accounts
held in any Investment Fund to any other Investment Fund then made available to
such Participant. Any such election shall be made prior to the time it is to be
effective in accordance with uniform rules established by the Committee. The
Committee may change any such investment election rules at any time without
prior notice to Participants.

6.10 Liquidity. In order to accommodate investment changes and other elections
by Participants in a timely manner, a certain portion of each of the Investment
Funds may be held in cash or cash equivalents. The percentage of assets held in
each Investment Fund in cash or cash

                                     - 27 -
<PAGE>

equivalents may differ from Fund to Fund and from time to time, as considered
appropriate by the Committee (or its delegate). The rate of return of each
Investment Fund will be a combination of the short term earnings (or losses) on
the cash portion of the Fund and the earnings (or losses) of the securities or
other investments in which such Fund is primarily invested, determined in
accordance with uniform rules established by the Committee (or its delegate).

6.11 Voting and Tendering of Common Stock. Notwithstanding any other provisions
of the Plan:

     (a) Effective January 1, 1999, Common Stock held by the Trustee shall be
     voted as follows:

          (i) Before each meeting of the Company's shareholders, each
     Participant shall be furnished with a proxy statement for the meeting,
     together with an appropriate form on which the Participant may provide
     voting instructions (including instruction on matters not specified in the
     proxy statement which may come before the meeting) for the Common Stock
     allocated to the Participant's Accounts under the Plan on the Valuation
     Date coinciding with or next preceding the record date for such meeting for
     which the number of such shares has been provided to the Plan
     administrator. Upon timely receipt of such instructions, such shares shall
     be voted as instructed.

          (ii) Common Stock for which the Trustee does not receive timely voting
     directions shall be voted in the same proportion as all Common Stock held
     under the Plan (including shares held in a separate trust fund) with
     respect to which directions are received by the Trustee.

     (b) Tender and exchange rights with respect to Common Stock held by the
     Trustee shall be exercised as follows:

          (i) Each Participant shall be furnished with a notice of any tender or
     exchange offer for, or a request or invitation for tender of, Common Stock,
     together with an appropriate form on which such Participant may instruct
     the Trustee with respect to the tender or exchange of Common Stock
     allocated to his Accounts. Common Stock as to which the Trustee has
     received timely instructions shall be tendered or exchanged in accordance
     with such instructions.

          (ii) Common Stock allocated to Participant's Accounts for which
     instructions are not timely received shall not be tendered or exchanged.

     (c) The Committee and the Trustee shall take all reasonable steps necessary
     to assure that Participants' individual directions shall remain
     confidential. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Trustee shall provide such
     information with respect to the tender or exchange of Common Stock as the
     Recordkeeper may require for operation of the Plan, if the Recordkeeper
     agrees to keep such information confidential. The Trustee shall execute
     such ballots, proxies or other instruments as may be necessary or desirable
     in order to effectuate the provisions of this Section 6.11.

                                     - 28 -
<PAGE>

6.12 Allocation Shall Not Vest Title. The fact that allocation is made and
amounts credited to the Accounts of a Participant shall not vest in such
Participant any right, title or interest in and to any assets except at the time
or times and upon the terms and conditions expressly set forth in this Plan, nor
shall the Trustee be required to segregate physically the assets of the Trust
Fund by reason thereof.

6.13 Committee Modifications. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this
Article VI, the Committee may in its sole discretion: (a) limit or restrict a
Participant's ability to change the allocation of his Accounts among the
Investment Funds and/or to designate the allocation of future contributions
among the Investment Funds, in order to conform to the practices and provisions
of any investment media held in any such Investment Fund; and (b) vary the
procedure otherwise provided for in this Article VI relating to the
determination and allocation of the investment return among Participants'
Accounts, in order to facilitate the administration of the Plan on an equitable
and practicable basis.

                                  ARTICLE VII

                                     Vesting

7.1 Matching and Profit Sharing Contributions. A Participant's Matching and
Profit Sharing Contributions Accounts shall vest in accordance with the
schedules set forth below.

     (a) Each Participant's Matching Contributions Account shall vest in
     accordance with the following:

          Years of Vesting Service      Vested Percentage

          Less than 2                      0%

          2                               20%

          3                               40%

          4                               60%

          5                               80%

          6                              100%

     (b) Subject to paragraph (c) below, the Profit Sharing Contributions
     Accounts of Participants credited with an Hour of Service before January 1,
     1997 shall vest in accordance with the following:

          Years of Vesting Service      Vested Percentage

          Less than 2                   0 percent

          2                             20 percent

          3                             40 percent

          4                             60 percent

          5                             80 percent

          6                             100 percent

     (c) The Profit Sharing Contributions Accounts for Participants who are
     credited with their first Hour of Service on or after January 1, 1997, or
     who had an Hour of Service before such date but had ceased earning vesting
     service prior to such date and had no vested interest under paragraph (b)
     as of such date, shall vest as follows:

                                     - 30 -
<PAGE>

         Years of Vesting Service       Vested Percentage

         Less than 5                    0 percent

         5                              100 percent

7.2 Tax-Saver, Qualified Non-Elective, Buy Back and Rollover Contributions
Accounts. A Participant's interest in his Tax-Saver, Qualified Non-Elective, Buy
Back and Rollover Contributions Accounts shall be fully vested and
nonforfeitable at all times.

7.3 Accelerated Vesting. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
Article VII, a Participant shall have a fully vested, nonforfeitable interest in
all of his Accounts if, while employed by the Company and its Affiliates, he
attains his Normal Retirement Date, dies or incurs a Disability. In addition,
the Accounts of all affected employees shall become fully vested and
nonforfeitable in the event of the Plan's termination (in accordance with
Section 13.3), partial termination (in accordance with applicable Treasury
Regulations) or the complete discontinuance of Employer contributions to the
Plan.

7.4 Forfeitures. If a Participant's employment with the Company and its
affiliates terminates before he is 100% vested in his Profit Sharing
Contributions Account and/or Matching Contributions Account, the non-vested
portions of his Profit Sharing and Matching Contributions Accounts shall be
forfeited as of the Valuation Date coincident with or next following the earlier
of the day as of which he receives (or is deemed to receive) the vested portion
of his Accounts or the day he incurs five consecutive One Year Breaks in
Service. For purposes of the foregoing, if a Participant's vested interest in
his Accounts has a value of zero, the Participant shall be deemed to have
received a single sum distribution of such zero vested interest upon his
Termination Date.

7.5 Restoration of Forfeiture and Buy Back Requirement. If a Participant who has
forfeited the non-vested portion of his Profit Sharing and/or Matching
Contributions Accounts is reemployed by the Company or one of its Affiliates
before he incurs five consecutive One Year Breaks in Service, the amounts
forfeited shall be restored to his Profit Sharing and Matching Contributions
Accounts as soon as administratively practicable after his reemployment date, if
the Participant repays the full amount of the distribution to the Plan (other
than the portion, if any, attributable to his Rollover Account) before the
earlier of (a) five years after the first date on which the Participant is
reemployed or (b) the date the Participant incurs five consecutive One Year
Breaks in Service following the date of distribution.

     The vested amount repaid by the Participant upon his reemployment pursuant
to this Section 7.5 shall be credited to a Buy Back Account in his name, his
interest in which shall always remain 100% vested and nonforfeitable.

     The restoration of the non-vested portion of his Accounts shall be funded
by forfeitures, and to the extent forfeitures are inadequate for this purpose,
by a special contribution which his Employer shall be required to make for this
purpose (without regard to the otherwise applicable limitations of the Plan).

                                     - 31 -
<PAGE>

7.6 Subaccount for Restored Amount. Any portion of a Participant's Matching
Contributions Account or Profit Sharing Contributions Account which is restored
pursuant to Section 7.5 after being contingently forfeited shall be maintained
in a special subaccount within his Matching Contributions Account or Profit
Sharing Contributions Account, as applicable. In order to prevent an
acceleration of vesting in such a Participant's Matching Contributions Account
or Profit Sharing Contributions Account, the vested portion of any such
subaccount as of any subsequent time shall be expressed by the formula:

                                    P(A+D)-D

where P is the Participant's vested percentage at such time determined without
regard to this sentence, A is the amount in such subaccount at such time, and D
is the amount of any distribution or partial distribution previously made to
him.

7.7 Application of Forfeitures. All forfeitures however occurring shall be
applied first to restore previously forfeited amounts as provided in Section
7.5, and to the extent not needed for this purpose, to reduce future Employer
contributions to the Plan.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                     Withdrawals and Loans During Employment

8.1 Withdrawals At Age 59 1/2. Except as provided in Sections 8.2 and 8.3, there
shall be no withdrawals of amounts credited to a Participant's Accounts under
the Plan while a Participant remains employed by the Company and its Affiliates,
until the Participant attains age 59 1/2, at which time he may withdraw all or
any portion of the vested balance of his Accounts for any reason.

8.2 Withdrawal from Rollover Account. A Participant may elect to withdraw all or
a portion of his Rollover Account at any time, but no more frequently than once
in any Plan Year.

8.3 Hardship Withdrawals. Subject to the further provisions of this Article
VIII, if a Participant has not yet attained age 59 1/2 and he has already
received all other amounts available to him as a withdrawal under Section 8.2 or
as a loan under Section 8.7, the Participant may elect to make a hardship
withdrawal from his remaining Accounts (excluding any loan balances) in the
following amounts and order of priority: (a) all or a part of his Buy-Back
Account, (b) if his Buy-Back Account has been exhausted, all or a part of the
vested portion of his Matching Contributions Account; (c) if the vested portion
of his Matching Contributions Account has been exhausted, all or a part of the
vested portion of his Profit Sharing Contributions Account; and (d) if the
vested portion of his Profit Sharing Contributions Account has been exhausted,
all or some of his Tax-Saver Contributions and any earnings on such
contributions credited to his Accounts before 1989. No amount attributable to
Qualified Non-Elective Contributions may be withdrawn under this Section 8.3.

8.4 Hardship Defined. To qualify as a "hardship" withdrawal, the withdrawal must
be necessary to satisfy one or more of the following needs:

     (a) medical expenses previously incurred by the Participant, or the
     Participant's spouse or dependents (as defined in section 152 of the Code)
     or expenses necessary in order for such persons to obtain medical care
     described in section 213(d) of the Code (which expenses will never be
     covered by insurance);

     (b) tuition payments, related educational fees (not including books and
     supplies), and room and board expenses, for the next 12 months of
     post-secondary education of a Participant or a Participant's spouse, child
     or dependent (as defined in section 152 of the Code);

     (c) costs (other than mortgage payments) directly related to the purchase
     of the principal residence of a Participant;

     (d) payments necessary to prevent the eviction of the Participant from the
     Participant's principal residence or foreclosure on the mortgage on that
     residence; or

     (e) such other expense as the Secretary of Treasury indicates qualifies as
     a hardship in Treasury Regulations.

                                     - 33 -
<PAGE>

In addition, a withdrawal will not be considered to be made on account of
hardship unless it is necessary to meet the condition of hardship affecting such
Participant. Before allowing a hardship withdrawal, the Committee shall require
a Participant to first take all other amounts available to him as a loan or a
distribution other than on account of hardship as herein defined, under this
Plan and all other plans maintained by any Employer or Affiliate. A Participant
making a hardship withdrawal shall be subject to the mandatory suspension and
limitation adjustment of Sections 4.6 and 5.4. A withdrawal made pursuant to the
foregoing restrictions and penalties shall be deemed to be necessary to
alleviate the Participant's condition of hardship.

8.5 Vesting Adjusted to Reflect Withdrawals. Notwithstanding any other provision
of this Plan, in the event that a Participant makes a withdrawal from his
Matching Contributions Account or Profit Sharing Contributions Account at a time
when he is less than 100% vested in such Account, and if his employment
subsequently terminates (or he requests another withdrawal therefrom) prior to
the time his interest in such Account is 100% vested, such Participant's vested
interest in his Matching Contributions Account and/or Profit Sharing
Contributions Account shall be adjusted to reflect such prior withdrawal in
accordance with the principles applicable to restored subaccounts under Section
7.6, in order to avoid an acceleration of vesting in his Matching Contributions
Account or Profit Sharing Contributions Account.

8.6 Withdrawal Payment. A withdrawal request under Section 8.2 or Section 8.3
shall be made by filing the Appropriate Form with the Committee, within such
time as the Committee may prescribe. The withdrawal shall be effective as of the
Valuation Date on which the Recordkeeper processes the withdrawal and, subject
to obtaining such consents and waivers as the Committee considers necessary to
comply with applicable Treasury Regulations, payment of the withdrawn amount
shall be made on or as soon as administratively practicable after such Valuation
Date. The Appropriate Form with respect to a hardship withdrawal from his
Tax-Saver Contributions Account shall include an acknowledgement of the
mandatory suspension of contributions described in Section 4.6, and to a similar
suspension of "elective deferrals" (as defined in section 402(g)(3) of the Code)
and of employee contributions under this Plan and each other qualified and
nonqualified plan of deferred compensation (excluding mandatory employee
contributions under any defined benefit plan), or stock option, stock purchase,
or similar plans, of any Employer or Affiliate until the first anniversary of
the date of such withdrawal, and to the adjustment described in Section 5.4 of
the "elective deferral limit" with respect to the Participant for the year
following the year of the withdrawal. Each such other plan shall be deemed
amended by reason of this provision and the Participant's execution of the
Appropriate Form to the extent necessary to give full effect to such agreement.
A Participant may direct on the Appropriate Form, at such time and in such
manner as the Committee may prescribe and subject to Committee consent, the
proportions in which any withdrawal from his Accounts pursuant to this Article
VIII shall be allocated among the Investment Funds; failing such direction or
consent, the allocation shall be made pro rata.

8.7 Loans. A Participant who is a "party in interest" with respect to the Plan
(within the meaning of section 3(14) of ERISA), may borrow from the vested
balance of his Accounts, subject to such uniform rules as the Committee shall
establish from time to time. No more than one loan may be outstanding at the
same time. The loan request shall be made on the Appropriate Form and submitted
to the Recordkeeper together with such application fee as the Committee may
authorize (if any). The Recordkeeper shall notify the Participant in writing

                                     - 34 -
<PAGE>

within a reasonable time of the approval or denial of such loan request, and
such notification by the Recordkeeper shall be final. The Committee may at any
time suspend authorization for future loans to Participants, but no such
suspension shall affect any loan then outstanding under this Section 8.7.

8.8 Loan Requirements. A loan pursuant to Section 8.7 shall not be made to a
Participant unless such loan meets all of the following requirements:

     (a) Amount. Such loan must be in an amount of not less than one thousand
     dollars ($1,000), and shall not exceed the lowest of (i) fifty thousand
     dollars ($50,000), (ii) one-half of the fully vested balance of the
     Participant's Accounts, or (iii) such other amount as may be determined by
     the Committee in the event that the Participant's Accounts are invested (in
     whole or in part) in an Investment Fund that restricts the liquidation of
     investments to fund Participant loans or otherwise. The limitations under
     each of clause (i) and (ii) above shall be reduced by the outstanding
     balance (if any) of all other loans to the Participant from any qualified
     plan (within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code maintained by the
     Company or any Affiliate. The fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) in clause
     (i) above shall be further reduced by the excess, if any, of the highest
     outstanding loan balance of all loans described in the preceding sentence
     during the twelve (12) month period preceding the loan, over the
     outstanding loan balance of all loans described in the preceding sentence.
     If any outstanding balance of a loan from another plan is required to be
     taken into account under clause (i) or (ii) above, the value of the
     Participant's interest under that plan from which such loan was made shall
     also be taken into account under clause (ii) above.

     (b) Adequate Security. Such loan must be adequately secured by the
     assignment, as collateral security, of the value of the Participant's fully
     vested Accounts. If the Loan Administrator subsequently determines that the
     loan is no longer adequately secured, he may require additional security in
     such form as he deems acceptable.

     (c) Interest. Such loan must bear interest, payable at quarterly intervals
     (or more frequent intervals, if the Recordkeeper shall so require), at a
     rate commensurate with the interest rates charged by persons in the
     business of lending money for loans which would be made under similar
     circumstances. The Recordkeeper shall at regular intervals (but no less
     frequently than quarterly) determine such rate on the basis of a review of
     pertinent information.

     (d) Repayment Term. Such loan must provide for substantially level
     amortization (within the meaning of section 72(p)(2)(C) of the Code) with
     payments made at least quarterly for a period no longer than five (5)
     years. If a Participant terminates employment with the Employers and
     Affiliates, his loan shall accelerate and become immediately due and
     payable as of the Participant's Termination Date.

     Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Participant shall have the right to prepay
     the full outstanding balance of his loan without penalty, on the first day
     of any calendar quarter or such other Valuation Date as the Committee may
     direct.

                                     - 35 -
<PAGE>

     (e) Promissory Note. Such loan must be evidenced by a promissory note
     executed by the Participant and, if the Recordkeeper shall in his sole
     discretion determine, also executed by the Participant's spouse. Such note
     shall provide that if the Participant is actively employed by an Employer,
     the loan is to be repaid by regular deductions from his pay in each pay
     period in which the loan is outstanding, and shall contain such terms and
     provisions as the Recordkeeper in his sole discretion shall determine.

8.9 Valuation for Loan Processing. The Recordkeeper will generally process a
loan based on the Valuation Date immediately preceding receipt of the loan
request, provided that the portion of the Participant's Accounts that may be
borrowed pursuant to paragraph 8.8(a) shall be fixed as of the Valuation Date
coinciding with the date the loan distribution is actually processed by the
Recordkeeper.

8.10 Funding of Participant Loans. A Participant's loan shall be funded solely
by reduction of the Participant's Account balances as of the effective date of
the loan. Such reduction shall affect the Participant's Accounts in the
following order: (a) Rollover Account (if any); (b) Buy Back Account (if any);
(c) Matching Contributions Account; (d) Profit Sharing Contributions Account and
(e) Tax-Saver Contributions Account. The promissory note executed pursuant to
paragraph 8.8(c) by a Participant who receives a loan shall be held by the
Trustee as a Trust asset and allocated solely to such Participant's Account. For
all purposes hereunder, the value of such promissory note shall be considered to
be the outstanding unpaid balance of the note. A loan to a Participant shall be
his individual directed investment.

8.11 Allocation of Loan Among Investment Funds. If a Participant's Account is
invested in more than one Investment Fund, the loan proceeds shall be obtained
from each Investment Fund pro rata in accordance with uniform rules established
by the Committee.

8.12 Loan Repayment. Payments of principal and interest on a Participant's loan
shall be used to restore the Participant's Accounts from which the loan was made
in the following order: (a) Tax-Saver Contributions Account; (b) Profit Sharing
Contributions Account (c) Matching Contributions Account; (d) Buy-Back Account;
and (e) Rollover Account. Such payments shall be allocated to such Investment
Funds as the Participant shall have designated for future contributions. If a
Participant fails to give timely and complete instructions as to the allocation
among Investment Funds, the payment of principal and interest shall be invested
in such Investment Fund or Funds as the Committee may direct.

8.13 Loan Expenses. The Recordkeeper may determine to charge any fees, taxes or
other expenses (including, without limitation, any asset liquidation charge or
similar extraordinary expense) incurred in connection with a loan to the
Accounts of the Participant obtaining such loan. Such charges shall be imposed
on a uniform and nondiscriminatory basis.

8.14 Disposition of Loan Upon Certain Events. In the event that distribution of
a Participant's Accounts is to be made under the terms of the Plan before the
Participant repays an outstanding loan, the Trustee shall reduce the value of
the Participant's Accounts by the amount of the Participant's outstanding loan
before making a distribution to the Participant or his Beneficiary.

                                     - 36 -
<PAGE>

8.15 Compliance with Applicable Law. The Recordkeeper shall take such actions as
he may deem appropriate in order to assure full compliance with all applicable
laws and regulations relating to Participants loans and the granting and
repayment thereof.

8.16 Loan Default. A loan made pursuant to Section 8.7 shall be in default if a
scheduled payment of principal or interest is not received by the Recordkeeper
by the end of the calendar quarter following the quarter in which the payment
was due. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Participant who terminates employment
with the Company and its Affiliates must repay the entire balance of his loans
within 30 days of his termination of employment to avoid a default, whether or
not such Participant is receiving an actual distribution of any other part of
his Account in connection with such termination. Upon default of the loan, the
entire outstanding principal amount and accrued interest of the loan shall
become immediately due and payable, and the Plan may execute upon the its
security interest in the Participant's Accounts to satisfy the debt; provided,
however, that the execution shall occur only when, and to the extent that, the
Participant's Accounts become distributable to the Participant consistent with
the requirements for qualification of the Plan under section 401(a) of the Code.
Furthermore, the Committee may take any other action it deems appropriate to
obtain payment of the outstanding amount of principal and accrued interest,
which may include accepting payments of principal and interest that were not
made on schedule and permitting the loan to remain outstanding under its
original payment schedule. Any costs incurred by the Plan in collecting, or
attempting to collect, amounts in default shall be charged against the
Participant's Accounts.

                                   ARTICLE IX

          Distributions to Participants After Termination of Employment

9.1 Distributions to Participants After Termination of Employment. When a
Participant's Termination Date occurs (for a reason other than his death), his
Accounts shall be distributed in accordance with the following provisions of
this Section 9.1, unless the Participant is reemployed by the Company or an
Affiliate before such distribution is processed.

     (a) Effective January 1, 1998, if the value of the Participant's Accounts
     does not exceed $5,000, his Accounts will be distributed to him in a lump
     sum payment as soon as practicable after the Plan's Recordkeeper is
     notified of his termination of employment. Whether this paragraph (a)
     applies and the amount of the payment to be made hereunder will be
     determined as of the Valuation Date coinciding with the date the payment is
     processed.

     (b) If the value of the Participant's Accounts exceeds $5,000, the
     Participant may withdraw his Accounts on the Distribution Date (as defined
     in paragraph (c) below) he elects, in either of the following forms of
     payment he selects: (i) a lump sum or (ii) monthly, quarterly, semi-annual
     or annual installments (to be as nearly equal as practicable) for a period
     not to exceed his life expectancy or the joint life expectancy of himself
     and his Beneficiary.

     (c) A "Distribution Date" shall mean the date as of which a payment is made
     to the Participant pursuant to this Section 9.1, without regard to any
     administrative delay. A Participant may elect that his Distribution Date
     occur as soon as practicable after his Termination Date or on any Valuation
     Date thereafter, but not later than the April 1 following the year in which
     he attains age 70 1/2, provided that no election of Distribution Date will
     be valid if it is made more than 90 days prior to such date.

Any election under paragraph (b) or (c) above shall be modified, as necessary,
to conform to Section 9.11.

9.2 Distribution Only Upon Separation From Service. The restrictions on
distributions prior to a Participant's separation from service previously set
forth in Section 9.2 have been repealed effective for distributions on or after
January 1, 2002 with respect to a Participant who has terminated employment with
the Company and its Affiliates (regardless of the date of such termination).

9.3 Form of Payment. Distributions from the Company Stock Fund shall be made in
cash unless the Participant elects to have all or a portion of his interest in
such fund distributed in shares of Common Stock. Distributions from the other
Investment Funds shall be made in cash, unless the Participant elects that some
or all of the balances of such funds be transferred to the Company Stock Fund
and distributed in shares of Common Stock in accordance with uniform rules
established by the Committee.

9.4 Direct Rollover Option. In accordance with uniform rules established by the
Committee, each Participant, surviving spouse of a Participant or alternate
payee under a

                                     - 38 -
<PAGE>

qualified domestic relations order within the meaning of section 414(p) of the
Code who is due to receive an eligible rollover distribution from the Plan may
direct the Trustee to transfer all or a portion of such distribution directly to
another eligible retirement plan. For purposes of this Section 9.4, the terms
"eligible rollover distribution" and "eligible retirement plan" as applied to
any such individual shall have the meaning accorded such terms under section
401(a)(31) of the Code (or any successor provision thereto) and applicable
regulations thereunder. Effective January 1, 2000, hardship withdrawals of
Tax-Saver Contributions made under Section 8.3 shall not be eligible rollover
distributions.

9.5 Put Option. If Common Stock acquired by the Plan, when distributed, is not
readily tradable on an established market, a Participant who is entitled to a
distribution of such stock shall have the right to require that the Company
repurchase it under a fair valuation formula in compliance with any applicable
regulations. Such put option shall be exercisable for a period of at least sixty
(60) days following the date of distribution of such Common Stock, and if the
put option is not exercised within such sixty (60) day period, for an additional
period of at least sixty (60) days in the following Plan Year as provided in
applicable regulations. The Company shall make full payment of the purchase
price for Common Stock which is the subject of a put option that is properly
exercised by a Participant within 30 days after the Participant surrenders to
the Company certificates representing such Common Stock, duly endorsed or
accompanied by a stock power duly executed, in either case with his signature
duly guaranteed, and accompanied by all required stock transfer stamps; provided
that, in the event the shares put to the Company were distributed to the
Participant as part of a total distribution, the Company may elect to make such
payment in substantially equal annual installments over a period beginning
within 30 days after the date the put option is exercised and not exceeding five
years if the Company provides adequate security and pays a reasonable interest
rate with respect thereto.

9.6 Facility of Payment. Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 9.1 or 10.1,
if in the Company's opinion, a Participant or other person entitled to benefits
under the Plan is under a legal disability or is in any way incapacitated so as
to be unable to manage his financial affairs, the Committee may direct the
Trustee to make payment to a relative or friend of such person for his benefit
until claim is made by a conservator or other person legally charged with the
care of his person or his estate. Thereafter, any benefits under the Plan to
which such Participant or other person is entitled shall be paid to such
conservator or other person legally charged with the care of his person or his
estate.

9.7 Interests Not Transferable. The interests of Participants and other persons
entitled to benefits under the Plan are not subject to the claims of their
creditors and may not be voluntarily or involuntarily assigned, alienated or
encumbered, except in the case of a properly documented levy of the Internal
Revenue Service, required tax withholding or qualified domestic relations orders
that relate to the provision of child support, alimony or marital rights of a
spouse, child or other dependent and which meet such other requirements as may
be imposed by section 414(p) of the Code or applicable Treasury Regulations.
Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary, distribution of
the entire portion of a Participant's Accounts awarded to his alternate payee
may be made in a lump sum payment, as soon as practicable after the Committee
(or its delegate) determines that such order is qualified, without regard to
whether the Participant would himself be entitled under the terms of the Plan to
withdraw or receive a distribution of such lump sum amount at that time, but
only if the terms of the order provide for such immediate

                                     - 39 -
<PAGE>

distribution either specifically or by general reference to any manner of
distribution permitted under the Plan.

9.8 Absence of Guaranty. None of the Company, the Trustee, or the Employers in
any way guarantee the assets of the Plan from loss or depreciation, or guarantee
any payment to any person. The liability of the Trustee to make any payment is
limited to the available assets of the Plan held under the Trust.

9.9 Missing Participants or Beneficiaries. Each Participant and each designated
Beneficiary must file with the Recordkeeper from time to time in writing his
post office address and each change of post office address. Any communication,
statement or notice addressed to a Participant or designated Beneficiary at his
last post office address filed with the Recordkeeper, or, in the case of a
Participant, if no address is filed with the Recordkeeper, then at his last post
office address as shown on the Employer's records, will be binding on the
Participant and his designated Beneficiary for all purposes of the Plan. None of
the Company, the Employers, or the Trustee will be required to search for or
locate a Participant or designated Beneficiary.

9.10 Doubt as to Right to Payment. In the event that at any time any doubt
exists as to the right of any person to any payment hereunder or the amount or
time of such payment (including, without limitation, any case of doubt as to
identity, or any case in which any notice has been received from any other
person claiming any interest in amounts payable hereunder, or any case in which
a claim from other persons may exist by reason of community property or similar
laws), the Committee shall be entitled, in its discretion, to direct the Trustee
to hold such sum as a segregated amount in trust until such right or amount or
time is determined or until order of a court of competent jurisdiction, or to
pay such sum into court in accordance with appropriate rules of law in such case
then provided, or to make payment only upon receipt of a bond or similar
indemnification (in such amount and in such form as is satisfactory to such
Committee).

9.11 Limits on Commencement and Duration of Payments. Except as expressly
provided below, the following provisions shall be applied in accordance with
sections 401(a)(9) and 401(a)(14) of the Code and applicable Treasury
Regulations and shall act as a restriction on (and not an enlargement of) any
other distribution provisions set forth herein:

     (a) Unless the Participant elects otherwise (which election may be
     passive), payment to a Participant under this Article IX shall be made or
     commenced not later than the 60th day after the close of the Plan Year in
     which occurs the later of his Termination Date or his Normal Retirement
     Date.

     (b) Distribution of the Participant's Accounts shall be made or shall
     commence no later than the April 1 following the calendar year in which
     later of the following occurs: (i) the Participant attains age 70 1/2 or
     (ii) the Participant terminates employment with the Company and its
     Affiliates.

     (c) A Participant who commences payment of his Accounts pursuant to
     paragraph (b) may choose his form of payment in accordance with paragraph
     9.1(b), subject to the remaining provisions of this Section 9.11.

                                     - 40 -
<PAGE>

     (d) Distribution shall be made over the life of the Participant or over the
     lives of the Participant and his Beneficiary (or over a period not
     extending beyond the life expectancy of such Participant or the point life
     expectancies of the Participant and his Beneficiary). For this purpose,
     life expectancy will not be recalculated each year.

     (e) If a Participant dies after distribution of his Accounts has begun, the
     remainder of his Accounts shall be distributed to his Beneficiary at least
     as rapidly as under the payment schedule commenced before his death.

     (f) If a Participant dies before distribution of his Accounts has begun,
     distribution to his Beneficiary shall be completed by December 31 of the
     calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the Participant's death,
     provided that this five-year rule shall not apply to a natural person
     designated as a Beneficiary by the Participant or under the terms of the
     Plan, if

          (i) the Participant's Accounts will be distributed over the life (or
     life expectancy) of such designated Beneficiary, and

     (g) the distribution to the Beneficiary begins not later than December 31
     of the calendar year following the calendar year of the Participant's death
     or, if the Beneficiary is the Participant's surviving spouse, not later
     than the December 31 following the calendar year in which the Participant
     would have attained age 70 1/2.

     (h) If the Participant's surviving spouse is his Beneficiary and the spouse
     dies before distribution to the spouse begins, paragraph (f) shall be
     applied as though the spouse were the Participant.

Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, the Plan will apply
the minimum distribution requirements of section 401(a)(9) of the Code for the
calendar year 2002 in accordance with the regulations under section 401(a)(9)
that were proposed on January 17, 2001 and thereafter in accordance with the
final and temporary regulations published on April 17, 2002.

9.12 Contributions Subsequent to Distribution. Any Employer contribution made
subsequent to the complete distribution of the balance of a Participant's
Accounts shall be paid to the Participant (or his Beneficiary, if applicable) as
soon as practicable after the date of such contribution.

9.13 Payments to Minors. If at any time a person entitled to receive any payment
hereunder is a minor, such payment, in the sole discretion of the Committee, may
be made for the benefit of such minor to his parent, guardian or the person with
whom he resides, or to the minor himself, and the release of any such parent,
guardian, person or minor shall be a valid and complete discharge for such
payment.

9.14 Identity of Proper Payee. The determination of the Committee as to the
identity of the proper payee of any payment and the amount properly payable
shall be conclusive, and payment in accordance with such determination shall
constitute a complete discharge of all obligations on account thereof.

                                     - 41 -
<PAGE>

9.15 Inability to Locate Payee. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan,
in the event that the Committee cannot locate any person to whom a payment is
due under this Plan, the benefit in respect of which such payment is to be made
shall be forfeited at such time as the Committee shall determine in its sole
discretion (but in all events prior to the time such benefit would otherwise
escheat under any applicable law); provided that, such benefit shall be
reinstated (from current forfeitures (if any), from investment gains within the
Trust Fund or from a special Employer contribution, as determined by the
Committee), if such person subsequently makes a valid claim for such benefit
prior to termination of the Plan.

9.16 Estoppel of Participants and Their Beneficiaries. The Employers, Committee
and Trustee may rely upon any certificate, statement or other representation
made to them by any employee, Participant, spouse or other beneficiary with
respect to age, length of service, leave of absence, date of cessation of
employment, marital status, or other fact required to be determined under any of
the provisions of this Plan, and shall not be liable on account of the payment
of any moneys or the doing of any act in reliance upon any such certificate,
statement or other representation. Any such certificate, statement or other
representation made by an employee or Participant shall be conclusively binding
upon such employee or Participant and his spouse or other beneficiary, and such
employee, Participant, spouse or beneficiary shall thereafter and forever be
stopped from disputing the truth and correctness of such certificate, statement
or other representation. Any such certificate, statement or other representation
made by a Participant's spouse or other beneficiary shall be conclusively
binding upon such spouse or beneficiary, and such spouse or beneficiary shall
thereafter and forever be stopped from disputing the truth and correctness of
such certificate, statement or other representation.

9.17 Community Property Laws. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary
contained in this Plan, the Committee may require consent of a Participant's
spouse to any election (or revocation of an election) with respect to the form
of payment of the Participant's benefits under the Plan, if the Committee, in
its sole discretion, deems such consent necessary or advisable in light of the
possible application thereto of community property or similar laws.

                                   ARTICLE X

                     Distribution Upon Death of Participant

10.1 Distribution to Beneficiary. If a Participant dies before his vested
Account balance has been fully paid to him, payment of the remainder of such
vested balance shall be paid to his Beneficiary in accordance with the
following:

     (a) If the Participant dies before payment to him has commenced, his
     Beneficiary may elect, subject to Section 9.11, either (i) a lump sum
     payment, (ii) monthly, quarterly, semi-annual or annual installment
     payments for a period not exceeding the Beneficiary's life expectancy, or
     (iii) if the Beneficiary is the Participant's Surviving Spouse, an annuity
     purchased for the Beneficiary from a commercial insurance company,
     commencing as of such Distribution Date the Beneficiary elects that is not
     later than the date that would have been the Participant's Normal
     Retirement Date (or as soon as practicable after the Participant's death if
     his death occurs after his Normal Retirement Date), provided that if the
     Participant's vested Account balance is $5,000 or less, payment shall
     automatically be made in a lump sum as soon as practicable after the
     Participant's death is confirmed, and provided further that if the
     Beneficiary does not elect payment in one of the permitted forms in a
     timely manner so as to comply with this paragraph (a) and Section 9.11, the
     Beneficiary shall be paid in a lump sum.

10.2 Distribution Upon Death of Participant. If the Participant dies after
commencing to receive installment payments in accordance with the clause
7.1(b)(ii), payment shall continue in the same form to his Beneficiary.

10.3 Designation of Beneficiary. Subject to the further provisions of this
Article X, each Participant may designate, at such time and in such manner as
the Committee shall prescribe, a Beneficiary or Beneficiaries (who may be a
natural person, executor, administrator, trust, foundation or other entity) to
receive the vested balance of his Accounts after his death. Such designation of
a Beneficiary or Beneficiaries shall not be effective for any purpose unless and
until it has been filed by the Participant with the Committee, provided,
however, that a designation mailed by the Participant to the Committee prior to
death and received by it after his death shall take effect upon such receipt,
but prospectively only and without prejudice to any payor or payee on account of
any payments made before receipt by the Committee. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, a Participant's sole Beneficiary shall be his Surviving Spouse, if
the Participant has a surviving spouse, unless the Participant has designated
another Beneficiary with Spousal Consent. For purposes of this Section 10.2 the
term "Spouse" or "Surviving Spouse" shall mean a Participant's legal spouse as
of the date of his death. A former legal spouse will be treated as the
Participant's Spouse to the extent provided in a qualified domestic relations
order (as defined in section 414(p) of the Code). The term "Spousal Consent"
shall mean written consent by a Participant's Spouse to an election, Beneficiary
designation or similar action by the Participant. A Spousal Consent shall be
ineffective unless it acknowledges the effect of such election, Beneficiary
designation or action and is witnessed by a notary public and, with respect to
Spousal Consent pertaining to a Beneficiary designation, unless such designation
specifically identifies the Participant's Beneficiaries (and alternate
Beneficiaries) by name or

                                     - 43 -
<PAGE>

class. If the Committee is satisfied that such Spousal Consent cannot be
obtained because there is no Spouse, because the Spouse cannot be located, or
because of other circumstances which may be permitted under applicable law,
Spousal Consent shall be deemed to have been given. Any consent or deemed
consent with respect to a Spouse which satisfies the foregoing requirements
shall be effective only with respect to the Spouse by whom given (or deemed to
be given), and may not be revoked by such Spouse with respect to the election,
Beneficiary designation or other action to which such consent pertains.

10.4 Change of Beneficiary. A Participant, from time to time in such manner as
the Committee shall prescribe, may change his designated Beneficiary or
Beneficiaries, but any such designation which has the effect of naming a person
other than the Surviving Spouse as sole Beneficiary is subject to the Spousal
Consent requirement of Section 10.2.

10.5 Failure to Designate Beneficiary. If a Participant has failed to properly
designate a Beneficiary to receive the Participant's death benefits, or a
Beneficiary previously designated has predeceased the Participant and no
alternative designation has become effective, such benefits shall be distributed
to the Participant's Surviving Spouse, if any, or if no Spouse survives the
Participant, to the Participant's estate.

10.6 Proof of Death. The Committee, as a condition precedent to making payment
to any Beneficiary, may require that a death certificate, burial certificate or
other evidence of death, and/or a court order or other evidence of the status
and authority of the Beneficiary or of any legal representative of the
Beneficiary, acceptable to it be furnished.

10.7 Discharge of Liability. If distribution in respect of a Participant's
Accounts is made to a person reasonably believed by the Committee or its
delegate (taking into account any document purporting to be a valid consent of
the Participant's spouse, or any representation by the Participant that he is
not married) to properly qualify as the Participant's Beneficiary under the
foregoing provisions of this Article X, the Plan shall have no further liability
with respect to such Accounts (or the portion thereof distributed).

                                   Trust Fund

11.1 Trust Agreement. By adopting the Plan, each Employer shall automatically
become a party to the Trust Agreement between the Company and the Trustee under
which the Trustee shall receive the contributions made by the Employers under
the Plan and shall hold, invest and distribute the Trust Fund in accordance with
the terms and provisions of the Trust Agreement. Any and all rights or benefits
which may accrue to any person under the Plan shall be subject to all the terms
and provisions of the Trust Agreement. In the event that the Trustee shall be a
bank or similar financial institution supervised by the United States or a
State, the Committee, in its discretion, may authorize the Trustee to invest all
or a part of the Plan's assets in deposits which bear a reasonable interest rate
in such bank or financial institution.

11.2 No Diversion of Trust Fund. The Trust Fund shall in no event be used for or
diverted to purposes other than for the exclusive benefit of Participants and
their Beneficiaries (including the payment of the expenses of the administration
of the Plan and of the Trust Fund), except that, at the Committee's request, a
contribution that is made by an Employer by a mistake of fact may be returned to
such Employer within one year after the payment of the contribution.

11.3 Duration of Trust. The Trust shall continue for such time as may be
necessary to accomplish the purposes for which it is created.

11.4 Company as Agent. The Company is hereby authorized to act as agent for all
other Employers in dealings with the Trustee under the Plan.

                                 Administration

12.1 Committee. A committee (the "Committee") consisting of not less than two
(2) members shall be appointed by the Board of Directors to administer the Plan
and oversee the investment of its assets. Each member of the Committee may
resign or may be removed at any time by the Board of Directors. In the event
that a vacancy or vacancies shall occur on the Committee, the remaining member
or members shall act as the Committee until the Board of Directors fills such
vacancy or vacancies. A member of the Committee shall serve without compensation
for his services as such member, and in the event of the removal, death or
resignation of any member, his successor shall be appointed by the Board of
Directors. No person shall be ineligible to be a member of a Committee because
he is, was or may become entitled to benefits under the Plan or because he is a
director and/or officer of an Employer or Affiliate or a Trustee; provided, that
no member of a Committee shall participate in any determination by the Committee
specifically relating to the disposition of his own Account. The members of the
Committee shall serve without bond except to the extent required by applicable
law.

12.2 Committee Powers and Authority. Except as otherwise expressly provided in
the Plan or in the Trust Agreement, or by the Board of Directors:

     (a) The Committee shall be responsible for the administration of the Plan
     as set forth herein. Otherwise, the Company shall be the plan administrator
     of the Plan within the meaning of section 3(16)(A) or ERISA and 414(g) of
     the Code.

     (b) The Committee shall be responsible for making appropriate provision for
     the investment and reinvestment of the Trust Fund.

     (c) The Committee shall have all powers necessary or helpful for the
     carrying out of its responsibilities hereunder, and the decisions or
     actions of the Committee in respect of any matter hereunder shall be
     conclusive and binding upon all parties concerned.

     (d) The Committee may delegate to one or more of its members, to the
     Recordkeeper or to any other duly appointed agent of the Committee,
     including but not limited to any individual employed in the Benefits
     Department of the Company, the right to act on its behalf in any one or
     more matters connected with the administration of the Plan.

     (e) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Committee shall
     have the power and absolute discretion to:

          (i) make rules and regulations for the administration of the Plan
     which are not inconsistent with the terms and provisions of the Plan;

          (ii) construe all terms, provisions, conditions and limitations of the
     Plan, resolve ambiguities, remedy inconsistencies and supply omissions;

          (iii) make all relevant factual findings; and

                                     - 46 -
<PAGE>

          (iv) conclusively determine all questions arising out of or in
     connection with the provisions of the Plan or its administration in any and
     all cases in which the Committee deems such a determination advisable,
     including but not limited to the power to determine the eligibility of
     employees to participate in the Plan and the rights of Participants and
     other persons entitled to benefits under the Plan and their respective
     benefits.

The foregoing list of powers is not intended to be either complete or exclusive,
and the Committee, in addition, shall have such other discretionary powers as
may be necessary for the performance of its duties under the Plan and the Trust
Agreement.

12.3 Limitation of Liability and Indemnification. Except as otherwise provided
by law, no person who is a member of the Committee, or who is an employee,
director or officer of an Employer or any Affiliate, shall incur any liability
whatsoever on account of any matter connected with or related to the Plan or the
administration of the Plan, unless such person shall have acted in bad faith, or
have willfully neglected his duties, in respect of the Plan. The Company shall
indemnify and save each such person harmless against any and all loss,
liability, claim, damage, cost and expense which may arise by reason of, or be
based upon, any matter connected with or related to the Plan or the
administration of the Plan (including, but not limited to, any and all expenses
whatsoever reasonably incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against
any litigation, commenced or threatened, or in settlement of any such claim
whatsoever), to the fullest extent permitted under the Certificate of
Incorporation and By-Laws of the Company.

12.4 Committee Action. A majority of the members of the Committee at the time in
office shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. The Committee
shall select from among its members a Chairman, and shall appoint (from its
members or otherwise) a Secretary. The Committee may act by vote or consent of
the majority of its members then in office and may establish its own procedures.
The Committee may authorize any one or more of its members or the Secretary of
the Committee to sign and deliver any instrument, certificate or other paper or
document on its behalf. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Section
12.4, if the Committee shall consist of only two members, both members shall be
necessary to establish a quorum for the transaction of business and action may
be taken only by unanimous vote, unless the action in question directly concerns
one of the Committee member's benefits under the Plan, in which event the other
member shall act as the Committee.

12.5 Subcommittees, Counsel and Agents. The Committee may appoint from its
members such subcommittees (of one or more such members), with such powers, as
the Committee shall determine. The Committee may employ such counsel (including
legal counsel, who may be counsel for an Employer or any Affiliate) and agents
and such clerical and other services as it may require in carrying out the
provisions of the Plan, and may charge the fees, charges and costs resulting
from such employment as an administrative expense to the Plan. Unless otherwise
required by law, persons employed by the Committee as counsel, or as its agents
or otherwise, may include members of the Committee, or of the Board or Boards of
Directors of any Employer or Affiliate, or firms with which members of the
Committee or Board or Boards of Directors of any Employer or Affiliate are
associated as partners, employees or otherwise.

                                     - 47 -

Persons serving on the Committee or on any subcommittee shall be fully protected
in acting or refraining from acting in accordance with the advice of legal or
other counsel.

12.6 Reliance on Information. The members of the Committee and any Employer and
Affiliate and their respective officers, directors and employees, shall be
entitled to rely upon all tables, valuations, certificates, opinions and reports
furnished by any actuary, accountant, trustee, insurance company, counsel,
physician or other expert who shall be engaged by the Committee, an Employer or
any Affiliate, and the members of the Committee and any Employer and Affiliate
and their respective officers, directors and employees, shall be fully protected
in respect of any action taken or suffered by them in good faith in reliance
thereon, and all action so taken or suffered shall be conclusive upon all
persons affected thereby.

12.7 Instructions to Trustee. The Committee shall provide appropriate
instructions in accordance with the Trust Agreement to enable the Trustee to
make the distributions provided for in the Plan.

12.8 Fiduciaries. The provisions of this Section 12.8 shall apply
notwithstanding any contrary provision of the Plan or of the Trust Agreement.

     (a) Named Fiduciaries. The named fiduciaries under the Plan shall be (i)
     the Company, (ii) the Committee and each of its members, and (iii) a
     Participant to the extent such Participant has directed the investment of
     his Accounts under Article VI.

          1.   Allocation of Fiduciary and Other Responsibilities. The Committee
               shall have the right, which shall be exercised in accordance with
               the procedures set forth in the Plan or in the Trust Agreement
               for action by the Committee, to allocate responsibilities
               (fiduciary or otherwise) among its members, and it shall have the
               right to designate persons other than the Committee to carry out
               responsibilities (fiduciary or otherwise) under the Plan.

     (b) Service in Multiple Capacities. Any person or group of persons may
     serve in more than one fiduciary capacity with respect to the Plan.

     (c) Advisers. The Committee, and any fiduciary designated by the Committee
     pursuant to paragraph (b) above to whom such power is granted by the
     Committee, may employ one or more persons to render advice with regard to
     any responsibility such fiduciary has under the Plan.

     (d) Investment Manager. The Committee may appoint an investment manager or
     managers, as defined in ERISA, to manage (including the power to acquire,
     invest and dispose of) any assets of the Plan.

     (e) Limitation of Liability. Except to the extent otherwise provided by
     law, if any duty or responsibility of a named fiduciary has been allocated
     or delegated to any other person in accordance with any provision of this
     Plan or of the Trust Agreement, then such named fiduciary shall not be
     liable for any act or omission of such person in carrying out such duty or
     responsibility.

12.9 Genuineness of Documents. The Committee, and any Employer and Affiliate and
their respective officers, directors and employees, shall be entitled to rely
upon any notice, request, consent, letter, telegram or other paper or document
believed by them or any of them to be genuine, and to have been signed or sent
by the proper person, and shall be fully protected in respect of any action
taken or suffered by them in good faith in reliance thereon.

12.10 Proper Proof. In any case in which an Employer or the Committee shall be
required under the Plan to take action upon the occurrence of any event, they
shall be under no obligation to take such action unless and until proper and
satisfactory evidence of such occurrence shall have been received by them.

12.11 Claims Procedure. The Committee shall establish a claims procedure in
accordance with applicable law and shall afford a reasonable opportunity to any
Participant or Beneficiary whose claim for benefits has been denied for a full
and fair review of the decision denying such claim.

12.12 Recordkeeper. The Committee may appoint a Recordkeeper to perform such
administrative functions as the Committee may determine from time to time,
including but not limited to the processing of loans, withdrawals and
distributions, and contribution and in accordance with Investment Fund elections
by Participant, in accordance with the terms of the Plan.

12.13 Administrative Expenses. Except as otherwise determined by the Company,
the expenses of administering the Plan and the fees and expenses incurred in
connection with the collection, administration, management, investment,
protection and distribution of the Plan assets under the Trust shall be paid
directly by the Trust out of Plan assets or, if paid by one or more Employers,
reimbursed by the Trust, to the maximum extent permitted by law, and shall be
allocated to Participants' Accounts in accordance with rules established by the
Committee in its sole discretion.

     Discontinuing Participation and Right of Company to Amend or Terminate

13.1 Discontinuance of Participation By an Employer. An Employer's participation
in the Plan shall cease in accordance with the following:

     (a) Any Employer may elect, at any time, to discontinue its participation
     hereunder in whole or in part with respect to any of its divisions or
     locations, by filing written notice thereof with the Board of Directors and
     the Committee and specifying the group or groups of Participants affected
     by such election.

     (b) The Plan shall be discontinued as to all Participants of any Employer
     which shall be declared bankrupt or which makes any general assignment for
     the benefit of creditors.

     (c) The Plan shall be discontinued as to Participants of any Employer in
     the event of the dissolution, merger, consolidation, or sale or other
     disposition of all of the business and assets or stock of such Employer,
     unless provision is made for the continuance of the Plan by a successor.

     (d) The Plan shall be discontinued as to Participants of any Employer that
     ceases to be a Controlled Group Member, unless the Board of Directions
     expressly permits its continued participation in the Plan.

In such event the Committee shall either make such current or deferred
distribution to the Participants affected by such discontinuance as it shall
deem appropriate and in accordance with the Plan, or in lieu thereof, direct
that the portion of the Trust Fund allocable to such Participants be transferred
to a successor qualified plan or funding medium, if provision is made for
coverage for such Participants under such plan or funding medium. No Participant
shall make any contributions to the Plan, after discontinuance of his Employer's
participation in the Plan with respect to him.

13.2 Amendment. The Company shall have the right to amend the Plan by resolution
of the Board of Directors, by resolution of any duly authorized committee
thereof or by written action of any duly authorized officer of the Company, to
any extent that it may deem advisable, and all Employers, employees,
Participants, and Beneficiaries shall be bound thereby. Where deemed necessary
or advisable in order to ensure compliance with applicable law (including
administrative interpretations thereof), amendments may be put into effect in
practice and in communications to Participants prior to the time that they are
embodied in formal amendments to the Plan document. No amendment shall reduce a
Participant's interest to the Plan to an amount less that what his interest
would have been if his Termination Date had occurred on the day of the
amendment.

13.3 Termination. The Plan may be terminated at any time by resolution of the
Board of Directors, provided that no such action shall permit any part of the
corpus or income of the Trust Fund to be used for or diverted to purposes other
than for the exclusive benefit of the Participants and their Beneficiaries under
the Plan and for the payment of the administrative costs of the Plan prior to
the satisfaction of all liabilities under the Plan.

13.4 Plan Merger. The Company may determine that the Plan should be merged with,
or the Company or the Committee may determine that all or a portion of the
Plan's assets should be transferred to, any other qualified plan within the
meaning of section 401(a) of the Code, and the Committee in its discretion may
permit the Plan to accept a transfer of all or a portion of the assets of
another qualified plan. In the case of any merger or consolidation with, or
transfer of assets or liabilities to or from, any other plan, each Participant
in this Plan shall be entitled to a benefit immediately after the merger,
consolidation, or transfer (if such other plan then terminated) which is equal
to or greater than the benefit he would have been entitled to receive
immediately before the merger, consolidation, or transfer (if the Plan had then
been terminated). In the event of a transfer or merger into the Plan, the
provisions of the other plan that pertain to optional forms of benefit and other
rights that may not be eliminated by amendment shall be incorporated herein by
reference to the extent necessary to comply with Section 411(d)(6) of the Code
and applicable Treasury Regulations until such time as a separate supplement
setting forth such protected features is added to the Plan.

14.1 Appropriate Forms and Filing with Committee. For all purposes of this Plan,
the date on which an Appropriate Form, Contribution Agreement, or any other
document is returned to or filed with the Committee shall be the date on which
such Appropriate Form, Contribution Agreement or other document is actually
received by the Committee or its designated agent. As and to the extent
determined by the Committee from time to time, an appropriate form may consist
of electronic or voice communication, provided that a Participant's designation
of a Beneficiary and any Spousal Consent required in connection with any such
designation shall be in writing. The Committee shall prescribe the conditions
for use of the Appropriate Form. Any submission by a Participant of an election
through an electronic or voice communication system shall constitute his valid
signature for purposes of any transaction effected thereby. An election made
through any such system shall be considered received on the day it is
transmitted, unless such transmission is received after the applicable cut-off
date and/or time prescribed by the Recordkeeper. The availability of electronic,
internet or interactive phone access to the Plan's recordkeeping system shall
not guaranty access to any Participant at a particular time.

14.2 Governing Laws. The Plan shall be governed by and construed and
administered under the laws of the State of [New Jersey], except to the extent
such laws are preempted by Federal law.

14.3 Separability. If any provision of this Plan is held invalid or
unenforceable, its invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect any other
provisions of the Plan and the Plan shall be construed and enforced as if such
provisions had not been included therein.

14.4 Captions. The captions contained herein and the table of contents prefixed
hereto are inserted only as a matter of convenience and for reference and in no
way define, limit, enlarge or describe the scope or intent of this Plan nor in
any way shall affect the Plan or the construction of any provision thereof.

14.5 Limitation of Liability. Except to the extent otherwise provided by law, no
liability shall attach to or be incurred by any stockholder, officer or director
of any Employer or any Affiliate, and if an Employer or Affiliate shall be a
partnership, any partner thereof, under or by reason of the terms, conditions
and provisions contained in this Plan or in the Trust Agreement, or for the acts
or decisions taken or made thereunder or in connection therewith; and as a
condition precedent to his participation in the Plan or the receipt of benefits
thereunder, or both, such liability, if any, is expressly waived and released by
each Participant and Beneficiary, and by any and all persons claiming under or
through such persons, such waiver and release to be conclusively evidenced by
any act or participation in or the acceptance of benefits or the making of
elections under this Plan.

14.6 Construction. The Plan is intended to constitute a qualified plan under
section 401(a) of the Code (which includes a qualified cash or deferred
arrangement within the meaning of section 401(k) of the Code) and to comply with
applicable provisions of ERISA. Accordingly, the Plan

                                     - 52 -
<PAGE>

shall, at all times, be construed and administered in a manner consistent with
the requirements of said sections 401(a) and 401(k) of the Code and the
requirements of ERISA.

14.7 Action by Employers. Except as otherwise provided herein, any action
required or permitted to be taken by the Company or any other Employer which is

                                   ARTICLE XV

                             "Top-Heavy" Provisions

15.1 Applicable Plans. For purposes of this Article XV, "Applicable Plans" shall
include (a) each plan of an Employer or an Affiliate in which a Key Employee (as
defined in Section [15.2] below for this Plan, and as defined in section 416(i)
of the Code for each other Applicable Plan) participates during the five
(5)-year period ending on such plan's "Determination Date" (as described in
Section 151.4 below) and (b) each other plan of an Employer or an Affiliate
which, during such period, enables any plan in clause (a) of this sentence to
meet the requirements of section 401(a)(4) or 410 of the Code. Any plan not
required to be included under the preceding sentence may also be included, at
the option of the Company, provided that the requirements of sections 401(a)(4)
and 410 of the Code continue to be satisfied for the group of Applicable Plans
after such inclusion. Applicable Plans shall include terminated plans, frozen
plans and, to the extent that benefits are provided with respect to service with
an Employer or an Affiliate, multiemployer plans (described in section 414(f) of
the Code) and multiple employer plans (described in section 413(c) of the Code)
to which an Employer or an Affiliate makes contributions.

15.2 Key Employee. For purposes of this Article XV, "Key Employee" for any Plan
Year shall mean an employee (including a former employee whether or not
deceased) of an Employer or an Affiliate who, at any time during a given Plan
Year or any of the four (4) preceding Plan Years, is one or more of the
following.

     (a) An officer of an Employer or an Affiliate having Top-Heavy Compensation
     of more than fifty percent (50%) of the dollar amount in effect under
     section 415(b)(1)(A) of the Code for any such Plan Year; provided, that the
     number of employees treated as officers shall be no more than fifty (50)
     or, if fewer, the greater of three (3) employees or ten percent (10%) of
     the employees (exclusive of employees described in section 414(q)(5) of the
     Code).

     (b) One of the ten (10) employees (i) having Top-Heavy Compensation of more
     than the dollar limit under section 415(c)(1)(A) and (ii) owning or
     considered as owning within the meaning of section 416(i) of the Code) the
     largest percentage interests in value of an Employer or an Affiliate,
     provided that such percentage interest exceeds one-half percent (.5%) in
     value. If two employees have the same interest in the Employer or an
     Affiliate, the employee having the greater Total Compensation shall be
     treated as having a larger interest.

     (c) A person owning (or considered as owning, within the meaning of section
     416(i) of the Code) more than five percent (5%) of the outstanding stock of
     an Employer or an Affiliate, or stock possessing more than five percent
     (5%) of the total combined voting power of all stock of the Employer or an
     Affiliate (or having more than five percent (5%) of the capital or profits
     interest in any Employer or an Affiliate that is not a corporation,
     determined under similar principles).

                                     - 54 -
<PAGE>

     (d) A one percent (1%) owner of an Employer or an Affiliate having
     Top-Heavy Compensation of more than one hundred fifty thousand dollars
     ($150,000). "One percent (1%) owner" means any person who would be
     described in paragraph (c) of Section [15.1.2] if "one percent (1%)" were
     substituted for "five percent (5%)" in each place where it appears in
     paragraph (c).

     For purposes of this Section [15.2], "Top-Heavy Compensation" means
"compensation" as that term is defined in section 414(q)(4) of the Code.

15.3 Top Heavy Condition. In any Plan Year for which the sum, for all Key
Employees (as defined in Section 15.2 above for this Plan and as defined in
section 416(i) of the Code for each other Applicable Plan), of the present value
of the cumulative accrued benefits under all Applicable Plans which are defined
benefit plans (determined based on the actuarial assumptions set forth in the
"top-heavy" provisions of such plans) and the aggregate of their accounts under
all Applicable Plans which are defined contribution plans, exceeds sixty percent
(60%) of a similar sum determined for all participants in such plans (but
excluding participants who are former Key Employees), the Plan shall be deemed
"Top-Heavy."

15.4 Determination Date. The determination as to whether this Plan is
"Top-Heavy" for a given Plan Year shall be made on the last day of the preceding
Plan Year (the "Determination Date"); and other plans shall be included in
determining whether this Plan is "Top-Heavy" based on the determination date as
defined in section 416(g)(4)(C) of the Code for each such plan which occurs in
the same calendar year as such Determination Date for this Plan.

15.5 Valuation. The value of account balances and the present value of accrued
benefits for each Applicable Plan will be determined, subject to section 416 of
the Code and the regulations thereunder, as of the most recent valuation date
that falls within or ends with the 12-month period ending on the applicable
determination date for such plan.

15.6 Distribution within Five Years. Subject to Section 15.7 below,
distributions from the Plan or any other Applicable Plan during the five
(5)-year period ending on the applicable Determination Date shall be taken into
account in determining whether the Plan is "Top-Heavy."

15.7 No Services within Five Years. Benefits and distributions shall not be
taken into account with respect to any individual who has not rendered any
services to any Employer or Affiliate at any time during the five (5)-year
period ending on the applicable Determination Date.

15.8 Compliance with Code Section 416. The calculation of the "top-heavy" ratio,
and the extent to which distributions, rollovers, and transfers are taken into
account will be made in accordance with Code section 416 and the regulations
thereunder.

15.9 Deductible Employee Contributions. Deductible employee contributions will
not be taken into account for purposes of computing the "top-heavy" ratio.

15.10 Beneficiaries. The terms "Key Employee" and "Participant" include their
Beneficiaries.

15.11 Accrued Benefit Under Defined Benefit Plans. Solely for purposes of
determining whether this Plan or any other Applicable Plan is "Top-Heavy" for a
given Plan Year, the

                                     - 55 -
<PAGE>

accrued benefit under any defined benefit plan of a Participant other than a Key
Employee shall be determined under (a) the method, if any, that uniformly
applies for accrual purposes under all defined benefit plans maintained by the
Employer or an Affiliate, or (b) if there is no such method, as if such benefit
accrued not more rapidly than at the slowest accrual rate permitted under the
fractional accrual rule of section 411(b)(1)(C) of the Code.

15.12 Provisions Applicable in "Top-Heavy" Years. For any Plan Year in which the
Plan is deemed to be "Top-Heavy," the following provisions shall apply to any
Participant who has not terminated employment before such Plan Year:

     (a) Required Allocation. The amount of Employer contributions and
     forfeitures which shall be allocated to the Account of any Participant who
     (a) is employed by an Employer or an Affiliate on the last day of the Plan
     Year and (b) is not a Key Employee shall be (i) at least three percent (3%)
     of such Participant's Total Compensation for such Plan Year, or, (ii) if
     less, an amount equal to such Total Compensation multiplied by the highest
     allocation rate for any Key Employee. For purposes of the preceding
     sentence, the allocation rate for each individual Key Employee shall be
     determined by dividing the Employer contributions and forfeitures allocated
     to such Key Employee's account (including elective contributions) under all
     Applicable Plans considered together by his Total Compensation; provided,
     however, that clause (ii) above shall not apply if this Plan enables a
     defined benefit plan required to be aggregated with this Plan under Section
     15.1 above to meet the requirements of section 401(a)(4) or 410 of the
     Code. The minimum allocation provisions of this Section 15.12 shall, to the
     extent necessary, be satisfied by special Employer contributions made by
     the Employer for that purpose. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the minimum
     allocations otherwise required by this Section 15.12 shall not be required
     to be made for any Participant (y) if such Participant is covered under a
     defined benefit plan maintained by an Employer or an Affiliate which
     provides the minimum benefit required under section 416(c)(1) of the Code,
     and/or (z) to the extent that the minimum allocation otherwise required by
     this Section 15.12 is made under another defined contribution plan
     maintained by an Employer or an Affiliate. In addition, any minimum
     allocation required to be made for a Participant who is not a Key Employee
     shall be deemed satisfied to the extent of the benefits provided by any
     other qualified plan maintained by an Employer or an Affiliate. For Plan
     Years beginning on or after January 1, 1989, Tax-Saver Contributions by a
     non-Key Employee shall be disregarded in determining the amount of
     contributions required to be allocated for his benefit under this Section
     15.12. For Plan Years beginning on or after January 1, 1989, Matching
     Contributions for a non-Key Employee that are taken into account to meet
     the minimum allocation requirements of this Section 15.12 shall be
     disregarded in applying the provisions of Sections 5.6 and 5.10 of the
     Plan.

     (b) Multiplier. For Plan Years beginning prior to January 1, 2000, except
     as otherwise provided by law, "1.00" shall be substituted for the
     multiplier "1.25" required by section 415(e)(2)(B)(i) and (3)(B)(i) of the
     Code, to the extent applicable, unless the following conditions are met::
     (a) the percentage described in Section 15.3 above does not exceed ninety
     percent (90%), and (b) "four percent (4%)" is substituted for "three
     percent (3%)" in paragraph (a) above

     Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, if the sum of the
combined limitation fractions described in section 415(e)(2) and (3) of the
Code, calculated by substituting "1.00" for "1.25" in applying section
415(e)(2)(B)(i) and (3)(B)(i) of the Code, for any Participant exceeds one
hundred percent (100%) for the last Plan Year before the Plan becomes
"Top-Heavy," such fractions shall be adjusted, in accordance with applicable
regulations, so that their sum does not exceed 100% for such Plan Year.

     (c) Vesting. Any Participant shall be vested in his Profit Sharing and
     Matching Contributions Account on a basis at least as favorable as is
     provided under the following schedule:

          Years of Service              Vested Percentage

          Less Than 2 Years             0%

          2 Years But Less Than 3       20%

          3 Years But Less Than 4       40%

          4 Years But Less Than 5       60%

          5 Years But Less Than 6       80%

          6 Years or More               100%


     In any Plan Year in which the Plan is not deemed to be "top- heavy," the
vested percentage shall be no less than that which was determined as of the last
day of the last Plan Year in which the Plan was deemed to be "top-heavy." The
minimum vesting schedule set out above shall apply to all benefits within the
meaning of Code section 411(a)(7) except those attributable to employee
contributions, including benefits accrued before the effective date of this
Article XV and benefits accrued before the Plan became "top-heavy." Any vesting
schedule change caused by alterations in the Plan's "top-heavy" status shall be
deemed to result from a Plan amendment giving rise to the right of election
required by Code section 411(a)(10)(B)

     (d) Bargaining Unit Employees. The provisions of paragraphs (a) and (c)
     above shall not apply to any employee included in a unit of employees
     covered by a collective bargaining agreement if, within the meaning of
     section 416(i)(4) of the Code, retirement benefits were the subject of good
     faith bargaining.

                                  ARTICLE XVI
                         Modification of Top-Heavy Rules

16.1 Effective Date. This Article XVI shall apply for purposes of determining
whether the plan is a top-heavy plan under section 416(g) of the Code for Plan
Years beginning after December 31, 2001, and whether the plan satisfies the
minimum benefits requirements of section 416(c) of the Code for such years. This
Article XVI amends Article XV of the Plan.

16.2 Modified Determination of Top-Heavy Status.

     (a) Key Employee. Key Employee means any employee or former employee
     (including any deceased employee) of an Employer or an Affiliate who at any
     time during the Plan Year that includes the Determination Date was an
     officer of an Employer or Affiliate having annual compensation greater than
     $130,000 (as adjusted under section 416(i)(1) of the Code for Plan Years
     beginning after December 31, 2002), a 5-percent owner of an Employer or
     Affiliate, or a 1-percent owner of an Employer or Affiliate having annual
     compensation of more than $150,000. For this purpose, annual compensation
     means compensation within the meaning of section 415(c)(3) of the Code. The
     determination of who is a Key Employee will be made in accordance with
     section 416(i)(1) of the Code and the applicable regulations and other
     guidance of general applicability issued thereunder.

     (b) Determination of Present Values And Amounts. This Section 16.2 (b)
     shall apply for purposes of determining the present values of accrued
     benefits and the amounts of account balances of employees as of the
     Determination Date.

          (i) Distributions during year ending on the Determination Date. The
     present values of accrued benefits and the amounts of account balances of
     an employee as of the Determination Date shall be increased by the
     distributions made with respect to the employee under the Plan and any Plan
     aggregated with the Plan under section 416(g)(2) of the Code during the
     1-year period ending on the Determination Date. The preceding sentence
     shall also apply to distributions under a terminated Plan which, had it not
     been terminated, would have been aggregated with the Plan under section
     416(g)(2)(A)(i) of the Code. In the case of a distribution made for a
     reason other than separation from service, death, or disability, this
     provision shall be applied by substituting a 5-year period for the 1-year
     period.

          (ii) Employees Not Performing Services During Year Ending On The
     Determination Date. The accrued benefits and accounts of any individual who
     has not performed services for an Employer or Affiliate during the 1-year
     period ending on the Determination Date shall not be taken into account.

16.3 Minimum Benefits.

     (a) Matching Contributions. Matching contributions shall be taken into
     account for purposes of satisfying the minimum contribution requirements of
     section 416(c)(2) of the Code and the Plan. The preceding sentence shall
     apply with respect to Matching Contributions under the Plan or, if the Plan
     provides that the minimum contribution requirement shall be met in another
     Plan, such other Plan. Matching Contributions that are used to satisfy the
     minimum contribution requirements shall be treated as Matching
     Contributions for purposes of the actual contribution percentage test and
     other requirements of section 401(m) of the Code.

     (b) Contributions Under Other Plans. The minimum benefit requirement may be
     met in another plan (including another plan that consists solely of a cash
     or deferred

                                     - 58 -
<PAGE>

     arrangement which meets the requirements of section 401(k)(12) of the Code
     and matching contributions with respect to which the requirements of
     section 401(m)(11) of the Code are met).

vested portion of his Profit

Sharing Contributions Account and Matching Contributions Account shall be
calculated in accordance with the Plan; provided, however, that employment
before the Merger shall be taken into account in determining Years of Vesting
Service as though it were employment with an Affiliate, except that the first
