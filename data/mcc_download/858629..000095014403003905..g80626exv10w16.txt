         Inc.), a Delaware corporation (herein, together with its successors
         and assigns, the "BORROWER");

                  (II)     the financial institutions listed on the signature
         pages hereof (the "LENDERS"),

                  (III)    NATIONAL CITY BANK OF KENTUCKY, a national banking
         association, as Administrative Agent (the "ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT") for

                  (IV)     BANK ONE, KENTUCKY, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION, a national
         association, as Syndication Agent (the "SYNDICATION AGENT").

         PRELIMINARY STATEMENTS:

         (1)      The Borrower, the Lenders named therein, the Administrative

         (2)      The parties hereto desire to amend certain terms of the
Credit Agreement, all as more fully set forth below.

         NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereby agree as follows:

         SECTION 1. AMENDMENT.

         Effective on the Amendment Effective Date (as defined in section 3
hereof), section 9.6(ii) of the Credit Agreement is amended by changing the
amount $5,000,000 where it appears in the last line of such section to
$8,000,000.

         SECTION 2. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.

                  The Borrower represents and warrants as follows:

                  2.1.     AUTHORIZATION, VALIDITY AND BINDING EFFECT. This
Amendment has been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the
part of the Borrower, has been duly executed and delivered by a duly authorized
officer or officers of the Borrower, and constitutes the valid and binding
agreement of the Borrower, enforceable against the Borrower in accordance with
its terms.


<PAGE>
                  2.2.     REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES TRUE AND CORRECT. The
representations and warranties of the Borrower contained in the Credit
Agreement, as amended hereby, are true and correct on and as of the date hereof
as though made on and as of the date hereof, except to the extent that such
representations and warranties expressly relate to a specified date, in which
case such representations and warranties are hereby reaffirmed as true and
correct when made.

                  2.3.     NO EVENT OF DEFAULT, ETC. No condition or event has
occurred or exists which constitutes or which, after notice or lapse of time or
both, would constitute an Event of Default.

                  2.4.     COMPLIANCE. The Borrower is in full compliance with
all covenants and agreements contained in the Credit Agreement, as amended
hereby.

         SECTION 3. EFFECTIVENESS.

         This Amendment shall become effective on and as of the date (the
"AMENDMENT EFFECTIVE DATE"), on or before September 23, 2002 if the following
conditions are satisfied:

                  (a)      this Amendment shall have been executed by the
         Borrower and the Administrative Agent, and counterparts hereof as so
         executed shall have been delivered to the Administrative Agent; and

                  (b)      the Administrative Agent shall have been notified by
         the Required Lenders that such Lenders have executed this Amendment
         (which notification may be by facsimile or other written confirmation
         of such execution).

The Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and each Lender in writing
of the effectiveness hereof.

         SECTION 4. RATIFICATIONS.

         The terms and provisions set forth in this Amendment shall modify and
supersede all inconsistent terms and provisions set forth in the Credit
Agreement, and except as expressly modified and superseded by this Amendment,

shall continue in full force and effect.

         SECTION 5. MISCELLANEOUS.

                  5.1.     SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS. This Amendment shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Borrower, each Lender and the
Administrative Agent and their respective permitted successors and assigns.

                  5.2.     SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. All
representations and warranties made in this Amendment shall survive the
execution and delivery of this Amendment, and no investigation by the
Administrative Agent or any Lender or any subsequent Loan or issuance of a
Letter of Credit shall affect the representations and warranties or the right
of the Administrative Agent or any Lender to rely upon them.


<PAGE>
                  5.3.     REFERENCE TO CREDIT AGREEMENT. The Credit Agreement
and any and all other agreements, instruments or documentation now or hereafter
executed and delivered pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement as amended
hereby, are hereby amended so that any reference therein to the Credit
Agreement shall mean a reference to the Credit Agreement as amended hereby.

                  5.4.     EXPENSES. As provided in the Credit Agreement, but
without limiting any terms or provisions thereof, the Borrower agrees to pay on
demand all costs and expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent in
connection with the preparation, negotiation, and execution of this Amendment,
including without limitation the costs and fees of the Administrative Agent's
special legal counsel, regardless of whether this Amendment becomes effective
in accordance with the terms hereof, and all costs and expenses incurred by the
Administrative Agent or any Lender in connection with the enforcement or
preservation of any rights under the Credit Agreement, as amended hereby.

                  5.5.     SEVERABILITY. Any term or provision of this
Amendment held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or
unenforceable shall not impair or invalidate the remainder of this Amendment
and the effect thereof shall be confined to the term or provision so held to be
invalid or unenforceable.

                  5.6.     APPLICABLE LAW. This Amendment shall be governed by
and construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Kentucky.

                  5.7.     HEADINGS. The headings, captions and arrangements
used in this Amendment are for convenience only and shall not affect the
interpretation of this Amendment.

                  5.8.     ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This Amendment is specifically
limited to the matters expressly set forth herein. This Amendment and all other
instruments, agreements and documentation executed and delivered in connection
with this Amendment embody the final, entire agreement among the parties hereto
with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all prior
commitments, agreements, representations and understandings, whether written or
oral, relating to the matters covered by this Amendment, and may not be
contradicted or varied by evidence of prior, contemporaneous or subsequent oral
agreements or discussions of the parties hereto. There are no oral agreements
among the parties hereto relating to the subject matter hereof or any other
subject matter relating to the Credit Agreement.

                  5.9.     COUNTERPARTS. This Amendment may be executed by the
parties hereto separately in one or more counterparts, each of which when so
executed shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which when taken
together shall constitute one and the same agreement.
