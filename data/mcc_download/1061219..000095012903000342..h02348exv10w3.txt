                              ARTICLE 2: SERVICES

         2.1 SERVICES; TERM. During the period beginning on the Closing Date and
ending on the tenth anniversary thereof, subject to the terms of this Article 2
and in exchange for the reimbursement described in Section 2.2, EPCO hereby
agrees to provide the General Partner with the following services (collectively,
the "Services"):

         (a) such management and operating services (other than SGA Services) as
may be necessary to manage and operate the business, properties and assets of
the Partnership Entities in substantially the same manner that such business,
properties and assets have been managed and operated by EPCO and its Affiliates
prior to the Closing Date; it being understood and agreed by the Parties that in
connection with the provision of such management and operating services EPCO
shall employ or otherwise retain the services of such personnel as may be
necessary to cause the business, properties and assets of the Partnership
Entities to be so managed and operated; and

         (b) such selling, general and administrative services (the "SGA
Services") as may be reasonably necessary to cause the business of the
Partnership Entities to be conducted in substantially the same manner in which
EPCO's business was conducted prior to the date hereof.

All Services provided by EPCO or its Affiliates hereunder shall be substantially
identical in nature and quality to the services of such type provided by EPCO
and its Affiliates with respect to the business, properties and assets of the
Partnership Entities during the one year period prior to the Closing Date. In
addition, EPCO shall use reasonable care in providing the Services.

         2.2 COMPENSATION. As compensation for the provision by EPCO to the
General Partner of the Services, EPCO shall be entitled to receive, and the
General Partner agrees to pay to EPCO, the following amounts:

                  (a) with respect to any SGA Services provided by EPCO or its
         Affiliates to the General Partner hereunder during a given period of
         time, an amount equal to the appropriate portion of the then applicable
         Administrative Services Fee; and

         (b) with respect to all Services other than SGA Services provided by
EPCO or its Affiliates to the General Partner hereunder during a given period of
time, an amount equal to the sum of all costs and expenses (other than SGA
Costs) incurred by EPCO and its Affiliates in connection with the provision of
such Services.

The aggregate amount payable by the General Partner to EPCO pursuant to this
Section 2.2 with respect to a given period of time shall be referred to herein
as the "Reimbursement Amount". In addition, the General Partner shall pay all
sales, use, excise, value added or similar taxes, if any, that may be applicable
from time to time in respect of the Services provided to it by EPCO.

         2.3 DISPUTE REGARDING SERVICES OR CALCULATION OF COSTS. Should there be
a dispute over the nature or quality of the Services or the calculation of the
Reimbursement Amount relating to the Services, EPCO and the General Partner
agree that the prior practice of EPCO with respect to the Services previously
provided with respect to the business, properties and assets of the Partnership
Entities or the calculation of the Reimbursement Amount relating to



                                       2

<PAGE>

such Services, as determined from the books and records of EPCO and its
Affiliates, shall be conclusive as to the nature and quality of the Services and
the reasonableness of the calculation of the Reimbursement Amount relating to
such Services, as the case may be.

         2.4 INVOICES. EPCO shall invoice the General Partner on or before the
20th day of each month for the estimated Reimbursement Amount for the next
succeeding month, plus or minus any adjustment necessary to correct prior
estimated billings to actual billings. All invoices shall be due and payable on
the last day of the month of the invoice. Upon request of the General Partner
EPCO shall furnish in reasonable detail a description of the Services performed
during any month.

         2.5 DISPUTES; DEFAULT. Notwithstanding any provision of this Article 2
to the contrary, should the General Partner fail to pay EPCO when due any
amounts owing to EPCO in respect of the Services, EPCO may, except as set forth
in the third succeeding sentence, upon 30 days' notice to the General Partner,
terminate this Article 2 as to those Services that relate to the unpaid portion
of the invoice. Should there be a dispute as to the propriety of invoiced
amounts, the General Partner shall pay all undisputed amounts on each invoice,
but shall be entitled to withhold payment of any amount in dispute and shall
promptly notify EPCO of such disputed amount. EPCO shall provide the General
Partner with records relating to the disputed amount so as to enable the parties
to resolve the dispute. So long as the parties are attempting in good faith to
resolve the dispute, EPCO shall not be entitled to terminate the Services that
relate to the disputed amount.

         2.6 INPUT. Any records, information or other input from the General
Partner that is necessary for EPCO to perform any Services shall be submitted to
EPCO by the General Partner in a manner consistent with the practices utilized
by EPCO and its Affiliates during the one year period prior to the Closing Date,
which manner shall not be altered except by mutual agreement of the parties. If
the General Partner's failure to supply such input renders EPCO's performance of
any Services unreasonably difficult, EPCO, upon reasonable notice to the General
Partner, may refuse to perform such Services.

         2.7 LIMITATION. The General Partner acknowledges that the Services
shall be provided only with respect to the business of the Partnership Entities
as operated on the Closing Date or as otherwise mutually agreed by EPCO and the
General Partner. EPCO shall not be required to perform any Services for the
benefit of any Person other than the Partnership Entities.

         2.8 REPRESENTATIONS REGARDING USE OF SERVICES. The General Partner
represents and agrees that it will use the Services only in accordance with all
applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations, and in accordance with
the reasonable conditions, rules, regulations, and specifications that may be
set forth in any manuals, materials, documents, or instructions furnished from
time to time by the General Partner to EPCO or by EPCO to the General Partner.
EPCO reserves the right to take all actions, including, without limitation,
termination of any particular Services, that EPCO reasonably believes to be
necessary to assure compliance with applicable laws and regulations.

         2.9 WARRANTY; LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. The Services shall be of the
same or similar quality as those provided by EPCO with respect to the business,
properties and assets of the



                                       3

<PAGE>

Partnership Entities during the one year period prior to the Closing Date.
EXCEPT AS SET FORTH IN THE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING SENTENCE, EPCO MAKES NO (AND
HEREBY DISCLAIMS AND NEGATES ANY AND ALL) WARRANTIES OR REPRESENTATIONS
WHATSOEVER, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO THE SERVICES. IN NO EVENT SHALL
EPCO OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES BE LIABLE TO THE GENERAL PARTNER OR ANY OTHER
PERSON FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR SPECIAL DAMAGES RESULTING FROM ANY
ERROR IN THE PERFORMANCE OF SERVICES, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER EPCO, ITS
AFFILIATES, OR OTHERS WHO MAY BE WHOLLY, CONCURRENTLY, PARTIALLY, OR SOLELY
NEGLIGENT OR OTHERWISE AT FAULT.

         2.10 FORCE MAJEURE. EPCO shall have no obligation to perform the
Services if its failure to do so is caused by or results from any act of God,
governmental action, natural disaster, strike, failure of essential equipment,
or any other cause or circumstance, whether similar or dissimilar to the
foregoing causes or circumstances, beyond the reasonable control of EPCO.

         2.11 AFFILIATES. At its election, EPCO may cause one or more of its
Affiliates or third party contractors reasonably acceptable to the General
Partner to provide the Services; however, EPCO shall remain responsible for the
provision of the Services in accordance with this Agreement.

                        ARTICLE 3: USE OF NAME AND MARK

         3.1 GRANT OF LICENSE. EPCO hereby grants to each of the Partnership
Entities (individually, a "Licensee"), and each Licensee hereby accepts, a
nontransferable, nonexclusive royalty-free right and license to use the Name and
Mark in connection with the business conducted by each such Licensee.

         3.2 USE. All use of and reference to the Name and Mark by each Licensee
shall be generally approved by EPCO prior to such use or reference, and all such
use and reference shall conform with such instructions and quality standards as
EPCO from time to time may issue. In no event shall use of or reference to the
Name and Mark be inconsistent in form or content with the sole ownership of the
Name and Mark by EPCO. All use of the Name and Mark by each Licensee, its
agents, servants, employees and vendees, shall inure solely to the benefit of
EPCO. EPCO shall have the right to make inspection of Licensee's services
rendered in connection with the Name and Mark to protect the goodwill of EPCO
associated with the Name and Mark.

         3.3 VARIATIONS. No Licensee shall adopt and commence using any
variations of the Name and Mark, or any other names and marks confusingly
similar thereto, without the prior approval of EPCO.

         3.4 NONTRANSFERABLE. The license granted to each Licensee to use the
Name and Mark is not assignable or transferable, and it shall not inure to the
benefit of any other Person, including, without limitation, a trustee in
bankruptcy or any other successor to any Licensee, whether by operation of law
or otherwise.

         3.5 INDEMNITY. Each Licensee agrees to be solely responsible for and to
defend and indemnify EPCO from and against any and all claims, demands and
causes of action, and all



                                       4

<PAGE>

costs, liabilities, expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable
attorney's fees), damages or judgments sustained in connection therewith,
arising out of, resulting from or related to the use of the Name and Mark by
such Licensee, its agents, servants, employees and representatives, even if such
claim, demand or cause of action is based on the sole, partial or concurrent
negligence of EPCO, except that EPCO shall defend and indemnify each Licensee
from and against all claims, demands or causes of action for trademark
infringement arising from the use of the Name and Mark by such Licensee. If
requested by EPCO, such Licensee shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to
EPCO to represent EPCO, and such Licensee shall pay the fees and expenses of
such counsel relating to such claim, demand, or cause of action. EPCO shall be
consulted with respect to all matters concerning such claim, demand, or cause of
action, and settlement of such claim, demand, or cause of action shall not be
made without the prior written approval of EPCO.

         3.6 TERMINATION. The license granted by this Article 3 shall terminate
automatically upon the expiration of the Applicable Period. As promptly as
practicable (but in no event more than 180 days) following the termination of
this license, each Licensee shall cease all use of the Name and Mark and any and
all other names and marks confusingly similar thereto. Termination of the
license shall not terminate each Licensee's continuing obligation of
indemnification under Section 3.5.

                           ARTICLE 4: INDEMNIFICATION

         4.1 INDEMNIFICATION. From and after the date hereof and subject to the
remaining provisions of this Article 4, EPCO shall indemnify, defend and hold
harmless the Partnership Entities from and against any loss, cost, claim,
liability, prepayment or similar penalty, damage, expense, attorneys fees,
judgment, award or settlement of any kind or nature whatsoever (other than
out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by the Partnership Entities in
connection with the discharge of their obligations pursuant to Section 4.2(b))
(collectively, "Losses") incurred by the Partnership Entities in connection with
the Excluded Liabilities; provided, however, in no event shall such
indemnification obligation, or the term "Losses," cover or include
consequential, indirect, or incidental damages or lost profits suffered by the
Partnership Entities in connection with the Excluded Liabilities, except to the
extent such consequential, indirect or incidental damages or lost profits are
actually paid to a third party.

         4.2 Indemnification Procedures.

         (a) EPCO shall have the right to control all aspects of the defense of
any claims (and any counterclaims) related to the Excluded Liabilities,
including, without limitation, the selection of counsel, determination of
whether to appeal any decision of any court and the settling of any such matter
or any issues relating thereto; provided, however, that no such settlement shall
be entered into without the consent of the Partnership Entities unless (i) it
includes a full release of the Partnership Entities from such matter or issues,
as the case may be or (ii) following such settlement there is no realistic
scenario under which the Partnership Entities could be held liable for such
matter or issues.

         (b) The Partnership Entities agree, at their own cost and expense, to
cooperate fully with EPCO with respect to all aspects of the defense of any
claims related to the Excluded



                                       5

<PAGE>

Liabilities, including, without limitation, the prompt furnishing to EPCO of any
correspondence or other notice relating thereto that the General Partner or the
Partnership Entities may receive, permitting the names of the General Partner
and the Partnership Entities to be utilized in connection with such defense and
the making available to EPCO of any files, records or other information of the
General Partner or the Partnership Entities that EPCO considers relevant to such
defense; provided, however, that in connection therewith EPCO agrees to use
reasonable efforts to minimize the impact thereof on the operations of such
Partnership Entities. In no event shall the obligation of the Partnership
Entities to cooperate with EPCO as set forth in the immediately preceding
sentence be construed as imposing upon the Partnership Entities an obligation to
hire and pay for counsel in connection with the defense of any claims related to
the Excluded Litigation.

                          ARTICLE 5: OTHER AGREEMENTS

         5.1 PROHIBITED ACTIVITIES. During the Applicable Period, EPCO agrees
that it will not, and will cause its Affiliates not to, engage in any Restricted
Activity, unless (a) notice of the opportunity to engage in such Restricted
Activity has first been given by EPCO to the General Partner, which notice shall
describe in reasonable detail the specific Restricted Activity that EPCO or its
applicable Affiliate desires to engage in, (b) the General Partner has notified
EPCO of its decision to permit EPCO or one of its Affiliates to undertake such
Restricted Activity to the exclusion of the Partnership Entities and (c) the
Audit and Conflicts Committee has approved such decision. The General Partner
agrees to give prompt consideration to any such notice. EPCO agrees and
acknowledges that the Partnership Entities do not have an adequate remedy at law
for the breach by EPCO or its Affiliates of the foregoing agreement, and that
any breach by EPCO or its Affiliates of the foregoing agreement would result in
irreparable injury to the Partnership Entities. EPCO further agrees and
acknowledges that the Partnership Entities may, in addition to the other
remedies which may be available to the Partnership Entities, file a suit in
equity to enjoin EPCO and its Affiliates from such breach.

         5.2 INSURANCE MATTERS. EPCO hereby agrees to cause the Partnership
Entities to be named as additional insureds in EPCO's current insurance program,
which is described on Exhibit A attached hereto. Each of the Partnership
Entities shall be allocated, and pay for, such insurance coverage in an amount
equal to EPCO's cost of insuring the assets and operations of such Partnership
Entity, and generally in accordance with the allocations and methodology
described in Exhibit A.

         5.3 COMMON CARRIER TRANSPORTATION CONTRACT. Effective June 1, 1998,
EPCO and the OLP entered into a Common Carrier Transportation Contract
substantially in the form of Exhibit B attached hereto, pursuant to which EPCO
agreed to provide trucking and other transportation services to the OLP.

         5.4 SUBLEASE OF EQUIPMENT. Dated June 1, 1998, EPCO and the OLP entered
into a Sublease Agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit C attached
hereto, pursuant to which EPCO agreed to sublease certain of its equipment to
the OLP.

         5.5 AGREEMENT REGARDING CERTAIN ASSETS RETAINED BY EPCO. With respect
to any assets or properties of EPCO and/or any of its Affiliates that would have
been a part of the assets



                                       6


<PAGE>

and properties transferred by EPCO or such Affiliate to the Partnership Entities
on or prior to the Closing Date (by operation of law or otherwise) but for the
existence of prohibitions against or conditions to such transfer that, if not
satisfied, would result in the breach by EPCO or one of its Affiliates of a
third party agreement or would terminate or give a third party the right to
terminate any rights of EPCO or such Affiliate in and to such asset or property
(any such asset or property being herein referred to as a "Restricted Asset" and
any such prohibition or condition being herein referred to as a "Restriction"),
EPCO agrees to (a) use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such Restriction
to be satisfied or waived, (b) transfer such Restricted Asset to the appropriate
Partnership Entity when and if such Restriction is satisfied or waived, provided
that such Restriction is satisfied or waived within 21 years of the death of the
last to die of the descendants of Joseph P. Kennedy, father of the late
President John F. Kennedy, who are living on the Closing Date, and (c) pending
the satisfaction or waiver of such Restriction and to the extent permitted by
applicable law and the terms of any applicable contracts or agreements, and
subject to any written agreements between EPCO and the Partnership Entities
regarding specific Restricted Assets, hold the Restricted Assets for the benefit
of and use by the Partnership Entities in order to permit the Partnership
Entities to realize, receive, and enjoy rights and benefits, and bear burdens
and obligations of the Restricted Assets, in each case that are substantially
similar to those that the Partnership Entities would have been able to realize,
receive and enjoy, or bear, as applicable, had such Restriction been satisfied
or waived.

         5.6 AGREEMENT REGARDING MONT BELVIEU PARTNERSHIP. The parties
acknowledge and agree that pursuant to the Plan of Merger, EPCO retained a one
percent economic interest, and all rights of EPCO as a "partner," in Mont
Belvieu Associates, a Texas general partnership ("Mont Belvieu"). With respect
to such interest and rights in Mont Belvieu retained by EPCO, EPCO agrees that
until such time as EPCO's rights as a "partner" in Mont Belvieu are transferred
to Enterprise Texas and Enterprise Texas is admitted to Mont Belvieu as a
partner, EPCO agrees to refrain from exercising or waiving any of its rights as
a "partner"" in Mont Belvieu without the prior approval of Enterprise Texas, and
will exercise or waive its rights, and vote its partnership interest, as
directed by Enterprise Texas. EPCO agrees that it will not sell or otherwise
transfer (including by way of a pledge) any of its partner interest in Mont
Belvieu without the approval of the Audit and Conflicts Committee. EPCO agrees
that, upon the occurrence of a Change of Control and subject to the receipt of
any applicable third-party consents or approvals, (a) EPCO will transfer to
Enterprise Texas the 49% partner interest for which the related economic
interest has already been transferred to Enterprise Texas without the payment of
further consideration by Enterprise Texas and (b) Enterprise Texas will have the
option to purchase from EPCO its remaining 1% partner interest in Mont Belvieu
for the fair market value thereof, as determined by agreement between EPCO and
the Audit and Conflicts Committee.

         5.7 AGREEMENT REGARDING BELVIEU ENVIRONMENTAL FUELS. The parties
acknowledge and agree that pursuant to the Plan of Merger, EPCO retained its

BEF without the prior approval of the OLP and will exercise or waive its rights,

Audit and Conflicts Committee. EPCO further agrees that, upon the occurrence of
a Change of Control and subject to the receipt of any applicable third-party
consents or approvals, it will transfer its rights as a partner in BEF to the
