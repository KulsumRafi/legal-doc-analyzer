                         SEVERANCE AND RELEASE AGREEMENT
                                     between
                                  Dennis Burns
                                       and
                           CLOSURE MEDICAL CORPORATION

     This SEVERANCE AND RELEASE AGREEMENT ("Agreement") is made and entered into
by Dennis Burns ("Burns") and Closure Medical Corporation ("Closure").
Throughout the remainder of this Agreement, Burns and Closure may be
collectively referred to as "the parties."

     Burns' employment with Closure terminated effective February 18, 2002.
Closure is willing to provide the benefits described herein in exchange for
Burns' entering into this Agreement.

     Closure hand delivered this Agreement to Burns on February 26, 2002.
Closure desires that Burns have adequate time and opportunity to review and
understand the consequences of entering into it. Accordingly, Closure advises
Burns: (i) to consult with his attorney prior to executing it; and (ii) that he
has at least twenty-one (21) days within which to consider it. In the event that
Burns does not return an executed copy of this Agreement to Mike Hoban by March
22, 2002, it and the obligations of Closure herein shall become null and void.

     Burns represents that he has carefully read the entire Agreement,
understands its consequences, and voluntarily enters into it.

     In consideration of the above and the mutual promises set forth below,
Closure and Burns agree as follows:

     1. TERMINATION. Burns' employment terminated effective midnight, February
18, 2002.

     2. SEVERANCE PAY. Closure will pay Burns severance pay in an amount equal
to six (6) months of his current salary (eighty thousand dollars ($80,000.00)),
payable in accordance with Closure's regular payroll practices and beginning
with the first regular pay day immediately following the expiration of the
revocation period set forth in Section 10 below.

     The compensation and benefits afforded under this Agreement are in lieu of
any other severance benefits to which Burns might otherwise be entitled.

     3. Should Burns obtain full-time employment, the continuation of benefits
hereunder shall terminate and Closure shall pay the remaining severance pay in a
lump sum.

     4. CONTINUATION OF BENEFITS. Closure shall continue coverage for Burns in
Closure's current health insurance plan (medical, dental & prescription drugs)
for six (6) months following the termination of Burns' Employment Agreement,
dated February 18, 1998. If Burns' participation in any such benefit plan is
barred by the terms of the plan, then Closure shall pay Burns, in cash, the
amount of the premium through the six month period. Should Burns become covered
by another plan during the six month period this coverage would cease.

     5. STOCK OPTIONS. Stock options, if any, will be administered in accordance
with the terms of the applicable stock option plan and stock option grant,
including, but not limited to, the terms governing the period of time during
which the optionee may exercise the options. Burns' ability to exercise vested
options shall continue ninety (90) days following the termination of the
Employment Agreement.

     6. BONUS. Closure will pay Burns his annual bonus for the year 2001, as
provided for, and calculated in good faith as provided for in his Employment
Agreement with Closure dated February 18, 1998.

Workers Benefit Protection Act of 1990 (OWBPA)), sex, national origin, race,

benefit plans, plan administrators, or agents on any of the released claims or
join as a party with others who may sue on any such claims.

     10. COMPANY INFORMATION AND PROPERTY. Burns shall not at any time after his
employment relationship with Closure terminates disclose, use or aid third
parties in obtaining or using any confidential or proprietary Closure
information. Confidential or proprietary information is information relating to
Closure or any aspect of its business which is not generally available to the
public, Closure's competitors, or other third parties, or ascertainable through
common sense or general business or technical knowledge. Nothing in this
Agreement shall relieve Burns from any obligations under any previously executed
confidentiality, proprietary information or secrecy agreements.

custody or possession of Closure or its agents in their capacity as such shall
be and remain Closure's property. If he hasn't already done so and upon

Carolina 27616.

     12. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY. This Agreement is intended to avoid all
litigation relating to Burns' employment with Closure and his separation
therefrom; therefore, it is not to be construed as Closure's admission of any
liability to Burns, liability which Closure denies.

     13. CONFIDENTIALITY/NON-DISPARAGEMENT. The terms and provisions of this
Agreement are confidential and Burns shall not disclose them to third parties,
except as required by law. Notwithstanding the above, Burns may reveal the terms

attorney whom he may consult for legal advice, provided that such persons agree
to maintain the confidentiality of this Agreement. For purposes of employment
and consulting assignments, Burns may need to recognize the Notice

have been made by any party or by anyone acting on behalf of any party, which

contained in this Agreement shall be valid or binding on the parties unless such
change or modification is in writing and is signed by the parties.

     16. SEVERABILITY. If a court of competent jurisdiction holds that any
provision or sub-part thereof contained in this Agreement is invalid, illegal or
unenforceable, that invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect
any other provision in this Agreement.

     17. PARTIES BOUND. This Agreement shall apply to, be binding upon and inure
to the benefit of the parties' successors, assigns, heirs and other
representatives.

received pursuant to this Agreement and indemnify Closure, its past, present or
future owners, parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, predecessors, successors,
assigns, officers, directors, stockholders, employees, employee benefit plans,
plan administrators, or agents for all expenses including attorneys' fees they
