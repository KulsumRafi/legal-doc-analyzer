            subject to and shall adhere to the following policies with regard to
            |*|:

            (1)   The Ask Jeeves knowledge base will have a system in place such
                  that any question identifiable as likely to elicit a |*|
                  response will be identified as such. Questioners will be
                  notified in advance of viewing |*| and will be given the
                  opportunity to opt out of having |*| results presented from
                  the knowledge base. Neither the Character nor the Caricature
                  shall be seen as directly addressing the matter of |*|or as
                  personally referring the questioner to an ensuing response
                  page which contains |*|are presented from the knowledge base,
                  then there shall be |*| the same manner as and in no larger or
                  more prominent print than that in which the name currently
                  appears on the navigation bar of the response page attached
                  hereto as Exhibit A. (Such a response page shall hereinafter
                  be referred to as a "Debranded Page".)

            (2)   All material appearing on non-Debranded Pages which are
                  generated from what is presently referred to as Ask Jeeves'
                  "Popularity Results" technology will be filtered by software
                  or by some other technology designed to screen out any such
                  material identified as |*| in nature. Ask Jeeves will utilize
                  at all times a filtering system at least as effective as the
                  filtering systems in use by the other leading informational
                  Web Sites. Ask Jeeves does not, however, guarantee that any
                  such filtering system will be foolproof in all circumstances.

            (3)   All material appearing on the portion of an Ask Jeeves
                  non-Debranded Page which retrieves results from and/or directs
                  questioners to third party sources (presently referred to as
                  the "meta search" portion) shall be filtered by the use of an
                  agreed list of banned words which are unambiguously |*| in
                  nature, such that all such material which would otherwise
                  include any word on the said list shall not appear. As of the
                  date hereof, the words included on the banned list are those
                  attached hereto as Exhibit B, but Ask Jeeves shall hereafter
                  consider in good faith any suggestions made by the Trust that
                  additional words be added, provided that the decision of Ask
                  Jeeves in this matter shall be controlling.

                  Ask Jeeves agrees that any third party source to which it
                  directs users from its site shall not include any site whose
                  primary purpose is to provide the type of objectionable
                  content referred to in paragraphs 3a, 3b and/or 4 hereof
                  unless material on such site is viewed only on Debranded
                  Pages.

      c.    Ask Jeeves may change the format or content of its Ask Jeeves
            Websites and/or Ask Jeeves Informational Products, or the methods by
            which it accomplishes the above-stated objectives, at any time in
            its sole good faith discretion, without notice to the Trust,
            provided the methods employed shall at all times accomplish no less
            than the levels of control required herein.

4. Banned Sites. Ask Jeeves presently maintains a policy of removing from its
knowledgebase sites and categories of sites which it deems inappropriate or
offensive (presently sites promoting |*|)("Banned Sites"). The Trust may at any
time suggest to Ask Jeeves certain sites or categories of subject matter to be
added to the Banned Sites list, which will be considered by Ask Jeeves in its
sole good faith discretion. Ask Jeeves may change the contents of the Banned
Sites list or its exclusion policies at any time in its sole good faith
discretion, but during the Term hereof it will not remove from the Banned Sites
list the categories of sites listed above.

5. Spanish and Japanese Language Sites. The policies provided in paragraphs 3
and 4 hereof shall not at this time apply to the two (2) Ask Jeeves Web Sites to
be operated in the Spanish language and the Japanese language pursuant to joint
venture agreements heretofore entered into by Ask Jeeves which do not currently
include such restrictions. At such time in the future as Ask Jeeves determines
that it is commercially feasible to do so, Ask Jeeves will request of the said
Spanish language and Japanese language joint venturers that they agree to
institute these procedures, or such similar procedures as may be agreed with
them, on the web sites to be operated pursuant to the said joint venture
agreements, but Ask Jeeves cannot guarantee that such procedures will be
adopted. Ask Jeeves shall advise the Trust of the extent to which these or
similar procedures are in place at the time each of the said two web sites are
launched, and if these procedures, or similar procedures acceptable to the
Trust, are not in place, then the license of rights from the Trust herein shall
not extend to that web site. However, by reason of the fact that agreements for
the said web sites were entered into by Ask Jeeves prior to the execution of
this agreement, the Trust irrevocably agrees to waive any claim against Ask
Jeeves, its joint venturers, in the said web sites and/or their respective
successors and assigns by reason of the fact that they do not comply with
paragraphs 3 and/or 4 hereof.

6. P. G. Wodehouse Page. The Home Page of any Ask Jeeves Web Site using the name
Jeeves, he Character or the Caricature in any manner (except the Spanish and
Japanese language web sites referred to in paragraph 5) will refer the viewer to
a P. G. Wodehouse page (the "Wodehouse Page") which will provide information
concerning the Author, the Works, their publishers and other P. G. Wodehouse
sites, all as selected by the Trust and as amended from time to time at the
request of the Trust. On the Wodehouse Page, the Trust will have the right to
include the disclaimer language in the form attached hereto as Exhibit C, or any
substantially similar variation thereof which the Trust may request from time to
time, with any changes in the disclaimer language subject to the prior approval
of Ask Jeeves, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld. The Wodehouse Page
will comply with the technical specifications contained in Ask Jeeves' published
editorial policies, and Ask Jeeves shall have no obligation to

      d.    Ask Jeeves will provide the Trust with a summary of all agreements
            entered into by Ask Jeeves, its Parents, Affiliates and/or
            Successors giving rise to an obligation on the part of Ask Jeeves to
            account to the Trust, it being understood that the inadvertent
            failure to comply with this paragraph shall not be deemed a breach
            of this Agreement by Ask Jeeves. The summary shall include the
            financial terms, extent of the grant of rights, all restrictions and
            limitations thereon and all rights of approval retained by Ask

            such agreements confidential except to the extent necessary to
            enforce its rights hereunder.

      e.    |*| The parties acknowledge that the two |*| described in Exhibits D
            and E attached to this Agreement have been |*|.

9. Character Depiction. In all of its uses of the name Jeeves, the Character and
the Caricature hereunder Ask Jeeves will not cause the Character or the
Caricature to appear with or be associated with any other P. G. Wodehouse
character or to be depicted with a distinctive character identified as his
master (irrespective of gender), whether or not that master might resemble a P.
G. Wodehouse character.

10. General Undertaking. In all of its uses of the name Jeeves, the Character
and the Caricature, Ask Jeeves will take no actions which are likely to cause
material harm, whether tangible or intangible, to the good will of the Trust or
to the Works. It is acknowledged and agreed by the Trust that any use of the
name Jeeves, the Character and the Caricature in compliance with the terms of
this Agreement is deemed not to cause material harm to the Trust or its assets.
Both parties will at all times act in good faith to comply with the
understandings contained in this Agreement.

11. The Character and the Caricature. It is acknowledged that the Trust is not
the owner of and has no rights in the Character or Caricature, and all such
rights are vested in Ask Jeeves. Notwithstanding same, Ask Jeeves agrees to the
restrictions imposed upon its use of the Character and the Caricature by the
terms of this Agreement during the term hereof. At such time, if ever, as this
Agreement shall have been terminated pursuant to paragraph 17 or 21 hereof, the
Trust shall not object to Ask Jeeves' use of the Character and the Caricature in
any manner, and the Trust shall have no financial interest therein except as to
amounts owed to the Trust under paragraphs 19 and 20 hereof for license
agreements entered into or arrangements made by Ask Jeeves prior to such
termination. Ask Jeeves shall then, however, be subject to the legal requirement
applicable to the general public that such use shall not infringe upon any of
the Trust's intellectual property rights.

12. Good Faith Attempt To Resolve Disputes. If the Trust believes that Ask
Jeeves is using the name Jeeves and/or the Character in a manner inconsistent
with this Agreement, the Trust will so advise Ask Jeeves in writing, and the
parties will promptly consult in good faith to attempt to reach agreement
concerning any objections made and/or changes requested by the Trust, failing
which either party may commence arbitration in accordance with paragraph 14
below. If the contested use is within the grant of Non-Exclusive Rights, Ask
Jeeves will not proceed with the project until the parties have agreed that it
may go forward or the matter has been resolved through arbitration in accordance
with paragraph 14 below. If the contested use is within the grant of Exclusive
Rights and Ask Jeeves alleges that such use is not in violation of the terms of
this Agreement, then Ask Jeeves is not hereby agreeing to cease or change such
use as requested by the Trust prior to the time when and unless there is a final
award in arbitration which holds that such contested use violates the terms of
this Agreement, but nevertheless in such event the provisions of paragraph 15
shall apply.

13. Third-Party Actions. Ask Jeeves will not be deemed to have violated the
terms of this Agreement by reason of the unauthorized actions of third parties
in altering any of the Ask Jeeves Products so as to render it not in compliance
with the terms hereof, provided that Ask Jeeves will monitor all Ask Jeeves
Products on a regular basis to determine whether any such alterations have
occurred, and if any such actions and/or alterations are discovered, Ask Jeeves
will make changes as promptly as commercially reasonable, so as to restore the
Ask Jeeves Products to compliance with the terms of this Agreement.

14. Arbitration. The parties agree to the final resolution of any dispute
arising under this Agreement by arbitration in accordance with the terms of this
paragraph, subject to the injunctive and other powers of the court exercisable
in aid of arbitral proceedings and in disputes referable to arbitration under
the terms of this Agreement.

      a.    In the event of a disagreement or dispute as described in paragraph
            12 or 21 hereof, or to establish adequate consideration under
            paragraph 20.e.(4) below, if the parties shall, not have resolved
            their differences with regard thereto within thirty (30) days after
            the disagreement or dispute has arisen, such disagreement or dispute
            shall be subject to resolution by arbitration in accordance with the
            terms of this paragraph.

      b.    In the event of any other dispute arising under this agreement or
            any alleged breach hereof, the party wishing to complain shall give
            notice in writing to the other party of the nature of the dispute or
            alleged breach and specify a reasonable time (not to be less than
            five (5) or more than ten (10) business days after the other party's
            receipt of the notice of complaint) for the complaint to be remedied
            and may then, if still not satisfied, refer the matter to
            arbitration for resolution in accordance with the terms of this
            paragraph.

      c.    In any such case, either party shall have the right to commence such
            arbitration solely in New York City before a single arbitrator
            selected or appointed from the panel of JAMS- ENDISPUTE, under its
            rules for expedited procedures. In the event JAMS- ENDISPUTE ceases
            to exist, the parties agree to use an alternative arbitration
            organization such as the American Arbitration Association under its
            Commercial Arbitration Rules, it being understood and agreed that
            any arbitration will take place solely in New York City and that the
            parties will concur in the most expeditious appointment of an
            arbitrator under the rules and procedures of the appropriate
            arbitration organization.

      d.    All decisions and awards of the arbitrator in such matters shall be
            binding on both parties and shall be enforceable through injunctive
            relief, specific performance or such other measures within the power
            of the arbitrator as the arbitrator shall consider just in the
            circumstances.

      e.    The arbitrator will have the power to apportion all reasonable legal
            fees and costs. The arbitrator shall keep the proceedings and all
            items disclosed under the arbitration confidential.

      f.    The arbitration shall be subject to applicable law of the state of
            New York. Judgment upon the award of the arbitrator may be entered
            in the highest court in the State of New York having jurisdiction
            and in any and all other United States, foreign or international
            courts and tribunals.

15. Delay Without Prejudice. In connection with any disagreement or dispute
involving actions or proposed actions by a party which are alleged by the other
party to be in violation of this agreement, it is agreed between the parties
that subsequent to receipt of written notice by a party from the other party
that such actions may be in violation of the terms of this Agreement, if the
receiving party continues or commences such disputed action it does so at its
own risk, and no delay in resolving the matter occasioned by the good-faith
consultation provision contained in this Agreement, the mandatory negotiation
periods contained in this Agreement, further negotiation between the parties or
actual arbitration proceedings shall be prejudicial to the position taken by the
complaining party at the time such notice was given, or to the right of the
complaining party to obtain injunctive relief and/or to recover damages incurred
from the date of commencement of the disputed actions either from a court in aid
of arbitration or from the arbitrator.

16. Trademarks and Domain Names.

      a.    The Trust hereby grants to Ask Jeeves the exclusive right during the
            term hereof to use the name Jeeves as trademarks and service marks
            restricted to the categories encompassed in the Exclusive Rights,
            and to register same in its own name or the name of its designees
            for all goods and services corresponding to such Exclusive Rights,
            provided that when the name Jeeves is used by Ask Jeeves in a tag
            line which Ask Jeeves registers as a trademark, such tag line shall
            be subject to prior approval by the Trust, which approval shall not
            be unreasonably withheld and shall be deemed granted if the Trust
            has not disapproved the tag line within ten (10) business days of
            receiving written notice from Ask Jeeves of the proposed tag line.

      b.    The Trust hereby acknowledges that it will not use, and will not
            dispute or object to the right of Ask Jeeves to use, the Character
            or Caricature as trademarks and service marks in any categories in
            which rights are licensed hereunder or any Ask Jeeves marks or trade
            dress. Nor will the Trust register, or dispute or object to the
            right of Ask Jeeves to register in its own name or the name of its
            designees, marks utilizing the Character or Caricature or any Ask
            Jeeves marks or Ask Jeeves Trade Dress.

      c.    The Trust hereby grants to Ask Jeeves a non-exclusive right during
            the term hereof to use the name Jeeves as part of trademarks and/or
            service marks in the categories encompassed in the Non-Exclusive
            Rights and to register same in its own name or the name of its
            designees for all goods and services corresponding to such
            Non-Exclusive Rights. This grant shall be exclusive to the extent of
            the following formats and shall be limited to the said formats: (i)

            and the Character or Caricature.

      d.    All other rights to register the name Jeeves or any depiction of the
            Wodehouse Jeeves (except in a manner confusingly similar to the
            Character, the Caricature, or Ask Jeeves' marks or Ask Jeeves Trade
            Dress) as trademarks and/or service marks are reserved to the Trust,
            provided that the Trust shall not use, or authorize third parties to

            (2)   in conjunction with the word "Ask" (or substantially similar
                  terms); or

            (3)   in a tag line confusingly similar to any tag line used by Ask
                  Jeeves, as permitted above.

      e.    Upon signing hereof Ask Jeeves will cancel or withdraw any trademark
            registrations and/or applications using the name Jeeves inconsistent
            with this Agreement, if any. Henceforth the parties will cooperate
            in connection with their respective trademark registration
            activities, and each party will formally consent, when requested, to
            the other's trademark registrations, provided such activities and
            registrations are consistent with the terms of this Agreement.

      f.    Ask Jeeves shall notify the Trust in writing of any unauthorized use
            by third parties of the name Jeeves or any unauthorized depiction of
            the Wodehouse Jeeves that comes to its attention. The Trust shall
            notify Ask Jeeves in writing of any unauthorized use by third
            parties that comes to its attention of the name Jeeves, the

            Jeeves, the Character and/or the Caricature and shall have the
            discretion as to whether or not to pursue any such claim. In the
            event Ask Jeeves shall not have elected to pursue any such claim as
            to the name Jeeves within thirty days after notice of the
            unauthorized use, the Trust shall have the right to do so to the
            extent that the Trust's rights in the Wodehouse Jeeves and/or the
            name Jeeves are infringed.. In all areas outside the Exclusive Field
            of Use Ask Jeeves shall have the right to prosecute, defend or
            settle all claims or suits to protect its rights in and to the name
            Jeeves, the Character and/or the Caricature, and the Trust shall

            protect its rights in and to the name Jeeves (outside the Exclusive
            Field of Use) and/or any depiction of the Wodehouse Jeeves, and both
            parties shall have the discretion as to whether or not to pursue any

            any claim as authorized herein, the other party shall cooperate in
            any such claim. All costs and expenses incurred by the prosecuting
            party in such actions shall be borne solely by the said party.

      g.    Nothingin this paragraph 16, or elsewhere in this Agreement, shall
            preclude either party from registering domain names for use on the
            Internet incorporating the Jeeves name, provided that the Trust has
            not registered and shall not register any domain name using the
            words "Ask" and "Jeeves" together, and Ask Jeeves and its
            affiliates, agents and employees will not register and refuse to
            transfer to the Trust any domain name using the name Jeeves or any
            variation thereof alone, i.e. without the word "Ask" immediately
            preceding it. Attached as Exhibit F is a list of the domain names
            registered by Ask Jeeves that include the name Jeeves or variations
            thereof. Ask Jeeves shall have the right to retain any domain name

            it to Ask Jeeves' Web Sites until such time as the Trust notifies
            Ask Jeeves that it intends to make substantial use of such domain
            name as permitted herein. Upon receipt of such notification Ask
            Jeeves agrees that upon reasonable demonstration by the Trust that
            its use will be substantial (e. g. not "parking" the domain) it will
            transfer to the Trust, upon payment by the Trust of all costs
            reasonably incurred by Ask Jeeves in registering and transferring
            such domain name, any such domain name held by Ask Jeeves, its
            affiliates, agents or employees, provided it does not also contain

            the content, including titles, plots and characters, of the Works
            except those rights specifically granted to Ask Jeeves in this
            Agreement, are hereby reserved to the Trust, and the Trust shall be
            free to exploit them in whatever manner it shall choose, subject to
            any restrictions imposed on the Trust by the terms of this
            Agreement.

      i.    This Agreement does not apply to any names, symbols, logos, drawings
            or other marks or domain names used by Ask Jeeves that do not
            include the name "Jeeves" or any variation thereof, the Character,
            the Caricature or any other depiction of the character Jeeves.

of this Agreement is perpetual unless and until terminated upon not less than
thirty (30) days written notice by Ask Jeeves to the Trust stating that Ask
Jeeves and its Parents, Affiliates and Successors have ceased all use of the
name Jeeves, and that they have no intention of resuming such use in the future.
As of the effective date of the said notice of termination, any rights granted
to Ask Jeeves by the Trust shall revert to the Trust and thereafter neither Ask
Jeeves nor any Parent, Affiliate or Successor of Ask Jeeves shall utilize the
name Jeeves in any manner whatsoever other than a descriptive fair-use reference
to the name as may be available to the general public. As of the said date Ask
Jeeves shall assign to the Trust an undivided co-interest in any then
outstanding licenses of any right to use the name Jeeves, the Character and/or
the Caricature, other than within the Exclusive Field of Use, theretofore issued
by Ask Jeeves or any Parent, Affiliate or Successor of Ask Jeeves to any
third-party, and thereafter the parties shall share equally any approvals and/or
other control provisions retained by Ask Jeeves in the said agreements and shall
continue to share proceeds therefrom as provided herein. Ask Jeeves will sign
any documents reasonably requested by the Trust to effect and/or evidence the
termination, reversion and assignments referred to in this paragraph, including
written notice to licensees under outstanding license agreements advising of the
assignment of a co-interest therein to the

Trust with an irrevocable instruction to thenceforth pay monies due to the Trust
from exploitation under the said license agreements directly to the Trust.
Failure of a third party to pay the Trust directly pursuant to such instructions

this Agreement pursuant to paragraph 17 above and shall have ceased using the

this Agreement the Trust shall advise Ask Jeeves of any licenses of the Jeeves

hereof, in which event the rights granted to Ask Jeeves hereunder pursuant to

licenses, and this Agreement shall be deemed amended accordingly.

Exclusive Rights, Ask Jeeves agrees to pay the Trust the following:

      a.    A guaranteed payment of $|*| payable in eight quarterly installments
            on the first day of each calendar quarter commencing as of January

            of signing hereof by release to the Trust of $|*| plus interest
            thereon heretofore held in escrow by Kay Collyer & Boose LLP under
            agreement dated January 18, 2000, and payment of an additional $|*|
            plus interest of $|*| to the Trust by Ask Jeeves.

      b.    If this Agreement shall not have been terminated prior to January 1,

                  day of the immediately preceding calendar year, but not less
                  than $|*| nor more than $|*| per quarterly payment. If Ask
                  Jeeves or its shareholders enter into a transaction, whether
                  in the form of a sale, merger or otherwise, by reason of which
                  Ask Jeeves is no longer an independent public company with an
                  identifiable Public Market Capitalization, then on the first
                  day of the calendar year commencing after the date of such
                  transaction, and on the first day of all calendar quarters
                  thereafter, the quarterly payment shall be (i) an amount equal

                  immediately preceding calendar year, of the surviving public
                  company owning substantially all of the assets formerly owned
                  by Ask Jeeves, but not less than $|*| nor more than $|*| or
                  (ii) if there is no surviving public company owning

                  immediately preceding year shall apply, and any necessary
                  adjustment will be made at the next subsequent quarterly
                  payment date after such determination.

      c.    If Ask Jeeves defaults in any quarterly payment hereunder and does
            not cure such default within ten (10) business days after receipt of
            written notice of default from the Trust, the Trust shall1have the
            right to seek enforcement of the payment obligations hereunder as
            provided in the dispute resolution procedures of this Agreement. The
            parties acknowledge and agree that in the event Ask Jeeves fails to
            make a quarterly payment or makes a quarterly payment, the amount of
            which is disputed by the Trust, such failure to pay or disputed
            payment will not give the Trust the right to terminate this
            Agreement unless the arbitrator, in accordance with paragraph 11
            above, determines such amounts are owing and Ask Jeeves fails to
            pay. Such termination shall be without prejudice to the Trust's
            rights to receive the payments guaranteed under paragraph 19(a)
            hereof, and following such termination neither Ask Jeeves nor any
            Parent, Affiliate or Successor shall have the right to use the name
            Jeeves in any manner whatsoever other than a fair use reference to
            the name as may be available to the general public.

                  the date of signing of this Agreement by release to the Trust
                  of $|*| plus interest thereon heretofore held in escrow by Kay
                  Collyer & Boose LLP under agreement dated January 18, 2000,
                  and payment of an additional $|*| to the Trust by Ask Jeeves.
                  Each annual payment shall be applied against and recouped from
                  any of the rights payments referred to in subparagraph (2)
                  below which become due and payable to the Trust during the
                  year in which the advance guarantee payment is made, except
                  that the two payments made on signing hereof shall be applied
                  against and recouped from any such payments due and payable

                  in accordance with the terms hereof or shall have reassigned
                  to the Trust in writing all |*| granted hereunder and an

                  rights issued by Ask Jeeves, its Parents, Affiliates and/or
                  Successors to third parties prior to such reassignment.
                  Subsequent to the date of such reassignment and during the
                  term of this Agreement neither Ask Jeeves nor its Parents,
                  Affiliates and/or Successors shall exploit further or license

                  Caricature except as granted under the grant of Exclusive

22. Accounting. Ask Jeeves shall prepare a statement of account semiannually as
of each June 30 and December 31 for all six-month periods during which there is
any exploitation by Ask Jeeves, any Parent, Affiliate or Successor of Ask Jeeves
or any assignee or licensee thereof, of those categories of rights as to which
royalties and/or profit participations are payable under this Agreement, which
statement shall include the following with regard to all uses of the rights
licensed hereunder: Full details of all exploitation to be accounted for under
this Agreement, together with a computation of monies due to the Trust for the
said period itemized in accordance with this Agreement and accompanied by
payment of the monies shown due thereon. The statement and payment shall be
rendered no later than ninety (90) days following the end of the semi-annual
period. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Trust
acknowledges and agrees that with respect to the Non-Exclusive Rights, Ask
Jeeves will not be responsible for making payment to the Trust as provided in
paragraph 20 unless and until Ask Jeeves has received such payment from the
sub-licensee, and a default by such sub-licensee in making such payment to Ask
Jeeves will not be deemed a default by Ask Jeeves under this Agreement provided
there shall also have been a failure to pay to Ask Jeeves its share of proceeds
and Ask Jeeves shall have taken all commercially reasonable steps to obtain such
payment.

23. Verification of Account. Ask Jeeves shall keep full, accurate, and timely
records and books of account relating to all exploitation for which Ask Jeeves
is to account to the Trust under

      filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Confidential

<PAGE>

paragraph 20 of this Agreement. Ask Jeeves shall similarly contractually require
any Parent, Affiliate, Successor, authorized licensee or third party with or
through which such exploitation is conducted to maintain such books of account.
Ask Jeeves shall keep all such records and books of account for not less than
two (2) calendar years from the end of each semiannual period of account and
shall permit a firm of certified public accountants not retained on a
contingency basis (not then conducting an audit of Ask Jeeves) on the Trust's
behalf to inspect and examine such records and books of account at the offices
where Ask Jeeves maintains such records and books, insofar as they directly
relate to exploitation for which Ask Jeeves is to account to the Trust under
this Agreement, and Ask Jeeves shall also, without charge, permit copies and
extracts to be made of such records and books of account during the course of
any such inspection and examination. Any such inspection and examination shall
require at least ten (10) days' prior written notice, be conducted during normal
office hours, and may not be carried out more than once in any calendar year.
The Trust's costs of any such inspection and examination shall be at the Trust's
expense unless such inspection and examination shall reveal an undisputed
underaccounting or underpayment to the Trust of at least 10% for any semiannual
accounting period, in which case Ask Jeeves shall bear the reasonable and
verifiable costs of the inspection and examination, but in no event exceeding
the actual amount of the underpayment. Ask Jeeves shall be furnished with a copy
of the audit report at the same time as it is furnished to the Trust. Failure by
the Trust to object in writing to any statement within two (2) years of receipt
shall be deemed an acceptance thereof and an irrevocable waiver of the right to
challenge such statement or the content thereof. Failure by the Trust to
commence an arbitration proceeding hereunder within one (1) year after written
notification to Ask Jeeves of objection to a statement or within one (1) year of
the date of an audit report shall be deemed an irrevocable waiver of the right
to challenge the statements which are the subject of the objection or audit, as
the case may be. Any books and records once audited may not be reaudited.

24. Assignment or Merger. Ask Jeeves shall not assign its rights under this
Agreement to any company except to a Parent, Affiliate or Successor of Ask
Jeeves. Any such assignment shall be effective only if the Trust is provided
with a copy of a duly executed agreement of assignment pursuant to which the
assignee (1) agrees to comply with and be liable for all of the terms and
obligations of Ask Jeeves under this agreement, and (2) acknowledges that the
Trust may take such steps or action (including arbitration) against the assignee
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement as if the Assignee had been an
original signatory of this Agreement. Ask Jeeves will be released from its
obligations under the Agreement upon its assignment to a Parent, Affiliate or
Successor of Ask Jeeves if the Trust is provided with an assignment as referred
to in the preceding sentence and the assignment is to a publicly owned company
with Public Market Capitalization greater than or substantially equal to that of
Ask Jeeves at the time of such transaction. In the event the proposed assignee
is not a company with a Public Market Capitalization greater than or
substantially equal to that of Ask Jeeves, Ask Jeeves, if it survives as an
independent or merged entity, agrees to remain responsible for its obligations
under this Agreement.

25. Sublicenses.

      a.    Any sublicense agreement pursuant to which rights granted to Ask
            Jeeves herein are licensed to a third party, whether that third
            party be a Parent, Affiliate or Successor of Ask Jeeves or any other
            person or entity, shall be a written

            agreement pursuant to which the sub-licensee agrees that it will
            comply with terms equivalent to the terms of this Agreement relevant
            to the rights being sublicensed. Ask Jeeves hereby agrees
            to-indemnify the Trust against any loss or damage to the Trust by
            reason of the failure of any sub-licensee to meet its obligations in
            accordance with this paragraph, other than any non-affiliated
            sublicensee's failure to pay any amounts owed under the sublicense
            provided that there shall also have been a failure to pay to Ask
            Jeeves its share of proceeds and Ask Jeeves shall have taken all
            commercially reasonable steps to obtain payment of the sum payable
            to the Trust.

      b.    Any license agreement hereafter entered into by the Trust
            authorizing use of the name Jeeves or a caricature of the Jeeves
            character shall be a written agreement pursuant to which the
            licensee is precluded from making any use of such name or caricature
            that would violate the terms of this Agreement. The Trust hereby
            agrees to indemnify Ask Jeeves against any loss or damage incurred
            by reason of the failure of any such licensee to meet its
            obligations in accordance with this paragraph.

26. Release. The parties hereby release each other from any and all claims
arising from any actions taken by either party prior to the date of signing of
this Agreement except to the extent of any claim arising as a result of a breach
of the warranties contained in paragraph 28 below.

27. Confidentiality.

      a.    The parties agree that the terms of this Agreement shall remain
            confidential and shall not be revealed to any third parties who are
            not within the control group of each party or the professional
            advisors thereto (and in those cases only under confidentiality.
            terms equivalent to those of this paragraph 27), except as may be
            required (i) to preserve any right or entitlement arising under this
            Agreement; (ii) to the adjudicating tribunal and any expert or ether
            witnesses during the course of any arbitration or litigation
            relating to this Agreement; (iii) as may be necessary in the course
            of negotiations with third parties, which third parties shall
            execute written non-disclosure agreements covering the terms of this
            Agreement; or (iv) as may be necessary to comply with any statutory
            or other legal obligation.

      b.    Press releases or responses to press inquiries concerning this
            Agreement and its terms shall be formulated and distributed in
            cooperation between the two parties and shall be subject to the
            reasonable approval of both parties. A party's failure to object to
            a press release or inquiry within ten business days of notice from
            the other party shall be deemed approval for that instance.

      c.    In addition, each party acknowledges that in connection with
            implementing the terms of this Agreement, it may become privy to
            certain Confidential Information of the other party. Each party
            agrees that at all times, and notwithstanding any termination or
            expiration of this Agreement, it will hold in strict confidence and
            not disclose to any third party Confidential Information of the
            other, except as approved in writing by the other party to this
            Agreement, and will use the

            Confidential Information for no purpose other than as necessary to
            implement the terms of this Agreement. Each party shall only permit
            access to Confidential information of the other party to those of
            its employees or authorized representatives having a need to know
            and who have signed confidentiality agreements or are otherwise
            bound by confidentiality obligations at least as restrictive as
            those contained herein. Each party shall immediately notify the
            other in writing upon discovery of any loss or unauthorized
            disclosure of the Confidential Information of the other party. Each
            party's obligations under this Agreement with respect to any portion
            of the other party's Confidential Information shall terminate when
            the party to whom confidential Information was disclosed (the
            "Recipient") can document that: (a) it was in the public domain at
            the time it was communicated to the Recipient by the other party;
            (b) it entered the public domain subsequent to the time it was
            communicated to the Recipient by the other party through no fault of
            the Recipient; (c) it was in the Recipient's possession free of any
            obligation of confidence at the time it was communicated to the
            Recipient by the other party; (d) it was rightfully communicated to
            the Recipient free of any obligation of confidence subsequent to the
            time it was communicated to the Recipient by the other party; (e) it
            was developed by employees or agents of the recipient independently
            of and without reference to any information communicated to the
            Recipient by the other party; (f) it was communicated by the other
            party to an unaffiliated third party free of any obligation of
            confidence; or (g) the communication was in response to a valid
            order by a court or other governmental body, was otherwise required
            by law, or was communicated solely as necessary to establish the
            rights of either party under this Agreement.

28. Warranties and Indemnities.

      a.    The Trust hereby warrants and represents that (i) the Trustees have
            the sole and exclusive right under the Trust instrument to enter
            into this agreement; (ii) the Trust is the sole owner of
            substantially all of the intellectual property in the Works as the
            Author's successor in interest; (iii) no claims adverse to the
            rights granted under this Agreement have been asserted against the
            Trust; (v) the Trust has not heretofore entered, and will not
            hereafter, during the term of this Agreement, enter into any
            agreements inconsistent with any of the rights granted under this
            Agreement to Ask Jeeves; (vi) the exercise of the rights granted to
            Ask Jeeves under this Agreement, if done m accordance with a terms
            hereof will not violate the personal or property rights of any third
            party; (vii) nothing on the Wodehouse Page will violate the personal
            or property right of any person or entity.

      b.    The Trust agrees to indemnify and hold Ask Jeeves, its Parents,
            Affiliates and Successors, and their respective licensees,
            successors and assigns (and their respective directors, officers,
            employees and agents) harmless from and against any losses, costs,
            expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and court costs),
            judgments and damages resulting from any claim, including any
            settlement thereof approved by the Trust, such approval not to be
            unreasonably withheld,

            which, if sustained, would constitute a breach of any of the
            foregoing warranties and representations made by the Trust. The
            liability for any obligation undertaken by the Trust hereunder shall
            be limited to recourse to the assets of the Trust and shall not
            constitute personal liability of the Trustees of the Trust or its
            beneficiaries. In the event of any third-party claim which in the
            good faith judgment of Ask Jeeves will, if sustained, establish a
            breach of the Trust's warranties and representations hereunder, Ask
            Jeeves shall have the right, pending the outcome of the said claim,
            to withhold and place in escrow monies otherwise due to the Trust
            hereunder, in an amount reasonably sufficient to satisfy the Trusts'
            obligations as to the said claim, the reasonableness of such
            withholding to be referable to arbitration under paragraph 14 of
            this Agreement if the Trust elects to do so.

      c.    The Trust will have no responsibility for any actions of third
            parties in violation of the rights granted to Ask Jeeves under this
            Agreement, provided those third parties have not been authorized to
            take such actions by the Trust. Additionally, the Trust will have no
            obligation to sue or take other action against such third parties
            but the Trust agrees to cooperate fully with any action taken
