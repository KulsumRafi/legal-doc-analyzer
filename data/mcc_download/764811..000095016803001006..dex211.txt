         the Post-Closing Consideration, each such issued and outstanding
         Company Share shall also be converted into the right to receive the
         following amount of FNB Shares (the "Closing Stock Consideration"):

                           (i) the lesser of (A) the number of FNB Shares with a
                  value, based on the Average Closing Price, of the Gross Cash
                  Consideration, and (B) the quotient obtained by dividing the
                  Gross Cash Consideration by $17.50, divided by

                           (ii) the number of Company Shares issued and
                  outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

                  (c) Post-Closing Cash Consideration. In addition to being
         converted into the right to receive the Closing Cash Consideration, the
         Closing Stock Consideration and the Post-Closing Stock Consideration
         (as defined below), each such issued and outstanding Company Share
         shall also be converted into the right to receive the following amount
         of cash, without interest (the "Post-Closing Cash Consideration"):

                           (i) the "Post-Closing Gross Cash Consideration,"
                  which shall be equal to fifty percent (50%) of the sum of (A)
                  the amount of the Company's consolidated net income for the
                  period from January 1, 2003 through the day immediately prior
                  to the date on which the Effective Time occurs, plus (B) the
                  amount obtained by subtracting (x) the amount of the Reserve
                  from (y) the Estimated Reserve (such net income and Reserve to
                  be determined as provided in this Section 3.3), divided by

                           (ii) the number of Company Shares issued and
                  outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

                  (d) Post-Closing Stock Consideration. In addition to being
         converted into the right to receive the Closing Cash Consideration, the
         Closing Stock Consideration and the Post-Closing Cash Consideration,
         each such issued and outstanding Company Share shall also be converted
         into the right to receive the following amount of FNB Shares (the
         "Post-Closing Stock Consideration"):

                           (i) the lesser of (A) the number of FNB Shares with a
                  value, based on the Average Closing Price, of the Post-Closing
                  Gross Cash Consideration, and (B) the quotient obtained by
                  dividing the Post-Closing Gross Cash Consideration by $17.50,
                  divided by

                           (ii) the number of Company Shares issued and
                  outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

         The sum of the Post-Closing Cash Consideration and the Post-Closing
Stock Consideration as determined pursuant to this Section 3.3 is referred to
herein as the "Post-Closing Consideration." The sum of the Post-Closing
Consideration, the Closing Cash Consideration and the Closing Stock
Consideration as determined pursuant to this Section 3.3 is referred to herein
as the "Merger Price."

         Prior to the Closing, the chief executive officer and the chief
financial officer of the Company shall deliver to FNB a certificate in form and
substance satisfactory to FNB and the Shareholders, setting forth in reasonable
detail the calculation of the Gross Cash Consideration pursuant to Section
3.3(a) above. FNB and its auditors shall have the right to verify and confirm
the amounts and calculations set forth in such certificate and shall have the
right to review all workpapers and procedures used to calculate Gross Cash
Consideration.

         Within 15 days after the Closing, the Shareholders shall cause to be
prepared and delivered to FNB a statement of the Company's consolidated net
income for the period from January 1, 2003 through the day immediately prior to
the date on which the Effective Time occurs ("2003 Net Income"). The 2003 Net
Income shall be determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles, consistently applied, and, notwithstanding the foregoing, shall
include deductions for the costs and expenses, including legal and accounting
fees and the fees of The Orr Group, Inc., incurred by the Company in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. FNB shall have the right
to review all work papers and procedures used to prepare the statement of 2003
Net Income and shall have 15 days from the date on which it receives such
statement to approve or disapprove it. If FNB does not deliver written notice to
the Shareholders of FNB's disapproval of the statement of 2003 Net Income within
such 15-day period, the statement of 2003 Net Income shall be conclusively
deemed approved by FNB. If, however, FNB does notify the Shareholders in writing
of FNB's disapproval of the statement of 2003 Net Income within such 15-day
period (stating with reasonable specificity the nature of the disapproval and
the basis therefor), FNB and the Shareholders shall promptly attempt to resolve
their differences. If they are unable to do so within 20 days, then the
determination of the 2003 Net Income shall be conclusively made by Dixon Odom
PLLC.

         Within 15 days after the Closing, FNB shall cause to be prepared and
delivered to the Shareholders a statement setting forth the Reserve. The
Shareholders shall have the right to review all work papers and procedures used
to prepare the statement of the Reserve and shall have 15 days from the date on
which it receives such statement to approve or disapprove it. If the
Shareholders do not deliver written notice to FNB of their disapproval of the
statement of the Reserve within such 15-day period, the Reserve as set forth by
FNB shall be conclusively deemed approved by the Shareholders. If, however, the
Shareholders do notify FNB in writing of their disapproval of the statement of
the Reserve within such 15-day period (stating with reasonable specificity the
nature of the disapproval and the basis therefor), FNB and the Shareholders
shall promptly attempt to resolve their differences. If they are unable to do so
within 20 days, then the determination of the Reserve shall be conclusively made
by Dixon Odom PLLC.

         Whenever, and by whichever of the foregoing methods, the 2003 Net
Income and the Reserve are determined, the amount of the Post-Closing
Consideration, if greater than zero, shall be issued in accordance with Section
3.4 as promptly as practicable following such determination. If the amount of
the Post-Closing Consideration is not greater than zero, then the Shareholders
shall pay to FNB the amount thereof promptly following such determination;
provided that FNB may elect, in its sole discretion, to deduct the amount of the
Post-Closing Consideration from the earn-out payments to be paid by the Company
pursuant to Section 3.5. The charges of Dixon Odom PLLC shall be borne one half
by FNB and one half by the Shareholders. If for any reason Dixon Odom PLLC is
unwilling to act under this Section 3.3, then FNB and the Shareholders shall
jointly instruct it to choose another nationally recognized accounting firm that
will agree so to act.

         No fractional FNB Shares will be issued and delivered in the Merger.
Each holder of Company Shares who would otherwise be entitled to receive a
fraction of a FNB Share shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash in an amount equal
to such fractional part of a FNB Share multiplied by the Average Closing Price.

         3.4 Payment of the Merger Price. At and after the Effective Time and
upon the proper surrender of certificate(s) representing Company Shares to FNB,
the holder of such certificate(s) shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the number of FNB Shares and the cash to which such holder is entitled
under Sections 3.1 and 3.3 (including any cash payments to which such holder is
entitled hereunder in respect of rights to receive fractional shares), subject
to any required withholding of applicable taxes. FNB shall not be obligated to
deliver any of such payments in cash or stock until such holder surrenders the
certificate(s) representing such holder's Company Shares and, with respect to
the Post-Closing Consideration, until the amount of the Post-Closing
Consideration is finally determined in accordance with Section 3.3. The
certificate(s) so surrendered shall be duly endorsed in blank, or accompanied by
stock powers duly endorsed in blank.

         3.5 Earn-out Payment. In addition to the Merger Price and in further
consideration of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the
Shareholders shall be eligible to receive earn-out payments over the four-year
period following the Effective Time to be paid by the Surviving Corporation in
cash and in an amount equal to 17.64% of the Surviving Corporation's Pre-Tax Net
Income over the period commencing on the first day of the month following the

                                     - 9 -

<PAGE>

Effective Time and ending on the last day of the month in which the fourth
anniversary of the Effective Time occurs but in no event shall the aggregate
earn-out payments payable hereunder exceed $800,000 (the "Earn-Out Cap").
Subject to the Earn-Out Cap, FNB shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay
the earn-out payments as follows:

                  (a) on or before January 31, 2004, the Surviving Corporation
         shall pay to the Shareholders 17.64% of the Surviving Corporation's
         Pre-Tax Net Income for the period commencing on the first day of the
         month following the Closing Date and ending at the close of business on
         December 31, 2003;

                  (b) on or before January 31, 2005, the Surviving Corporation
         shall pay to the Shareholders 17.64% of the Surviving Corporation's
         Pre-Tax Net Income for calendar year 2004;

                  (c) on or before January 31, 2006, the Surviving Corporation
         shall pay to the Shareholders 17.64% of the Company's Pre-Tax Net
         Income for calendar year 2005;

                  (d) on or before January 31, 2007, the Surviving Corporation
         shall pay to the Shareholders 17.64% of the Company's Pre-Tax Net
         Income for calendar year 2006; and

                  (e) on or before the last day of the month following the month
         in which the fourth anniversary of the Closing Date occurs, the
         Surviving Corporation shall pay to the Shareholders 17.64% of the
         Company's Pre-Tax Net Income for the period commencing on January 1,
         2007, and ending at the close of business on the last day of the month
         in which the fourth anniversary of the Closing Date occurs.

         The portion of each earn-out payment payable to each Shareholder shall
be equal to the amount of the earn-out payment multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of Company Shares owned by such Shareholder
immediately prior to the Effective Time as shown on Exhibit B and the
denominator of which is the total number of Company Shares issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

         The purposes of this Section 3.5, "Pre-Tax Net Income" for any period
means the Surviving Corporation's aggregate earnings net of losses from
operations, calculated as though the Surviving Corporation operated as a
separate and independent corporation, after deduction of all appropriate
expenses, charges and reserves, but before adjustment for federal and state
income taxes. Pre-Tax Net Income shall be determined in accordance with
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles consistently applied as determined by
FNB or the firm of independent certified public accountants engaged by FNB for
purposes of its own audit. In determining such Pre-Tax Net Income:

                           (i) Pre-Tax Net Income shall be computed without
                  regard to "extraordinary items" of gain or loss as that term
                  shall be defined by Generally Accepted Accounting Principles;

                           (ii) Pre-Tax Net Income shall not include any gains,
                  profits or losses realized from the sale of any assets other
                  than in the ordinary course of business;

<PAGE>

                           (iii) Pre-Tax Net Income shall include a deduction
                  for (x) the allocation of reasonable and appropriately
                  documented direct overhead expenses, (y) payment of salaries
                  and bonuses for officers and employees of the Company,
                  including any accruals for the retention bonuses contemplated
                  by Section 7.14(b) hereof but excluding any accruals for the
                  retention bonuses contemplated by Section 7.14(a) hereof, and
                  (z) interest charged in any loans or advances made by FNB or
                  any of its Affiliates to the Company in connection with its
                  business operations; provided that such interest charges shall
                  not exceed those that FNB or such Affiliate would charge to
                  similarly situated third parties in arm's-length transactions
                  and provided further that the Company shall not be obligated
                  to satisfy its borrowing needs from FNB or any of its
                  Affiliates but may borrow from third-party lenders; and

                           (iv) Pre-Tax Net Income shall not include any income
                  or expenses related to the acquisition, disposition or
                  operation of any other mortgage brokerage, mortgage banking or
                  lending business subsequent to the Closing but shall include
                  any income or expenses related to the expansion of the
                  Company's business through the opening and operation by the
                  Company of any de novo loan origination offices.

         For purposes of clause (iii) above, following the Closing and upon the
request of the Company, FNB shall use its reasonable efforts to assist the
Company in efforts to lower the Company's cost of funds.

         5.2 Shareholders.

                  (a) Ownership of Company Shares. The Shareholders collectively
         own all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of the
         Company, free and clear of any Claims except as Previously Disclosed.
         Each Shareholder is the sole holder of record and beneficial owner of
         such number of Company Shares as Previously Disclosed.

                  (b) Authority Relative to this Agreement. Each of the
         Shareholders has the legal right, power, authority and capacity to
         execute and deliver this Agreement, to perform his obligations
         hereunder and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. This
         Agreement constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of each
         of the Shareholders, enforceable against him in accordance with its
         terms (except as such enforceability may be limited by applicable
         bankruptcy, insolvency or other laws of general applicability affecting
         creditors' rights and by general principles of equity that may limit
         the specific performance of particular provisions).

         5.3 Assets. The Company has good, valid and marketable title to, or
valid leasehold interests in, all of its Assets free and clear of all mortgages,
liens, security interests or encumbrances of any nature whatsoever except
"Permitted Liens," which means (i) liens for current taxes not yet due and
payable, (ii) liens in favor of carriers, warehousemen, mechanics, landlords and
materialmen imposed by mandatory provisions of law and incurred in the ordinary
course of business for sums not yet due and payable, and (iii) those liens
Previously Disclosed. The Company has Previously Disclosed to FNB a listing of
each lease and any amendments thereto pursuant to which the Company leases or
licenses Assets other than Real Property from any other Person providing for
rentals of $2,500 per year or greater. Except for such leased or licensed Assets
and except for the Real Property leased by the Company as Previously Disclosed,
there are no Assets (other than Assets that in the aggregate do not have a value
in excess of $2,000) used by the Company in the operation of its business that
are not owned by the Company. The Assets owned, licensed and leased by the
Company constitute all of the Assets sufficient to conduct the business of the
Company as presently conducted and are in a good state of repair in all material
respects, ordinary wear and tear excepted, and usable by the Company for their
intended purposes.

         5.4 Interests in Real Property. The Company's leasehold interests in
the offices Previously Disclosed to FNB comprise all of the Real Property in
which the Company has any interest (other than any interest arising out of the
ordinary course of its mortgage lending activities), and each such leasehold
interest is valid and subsisting. The Company has Previously Disclosed to FNB a
listing of all leases and any amendments thereto pursuant to which the Company
leases Real Property. Each such lease is valid and enforceable in accordance
with its terms (except as its enforceability may be limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency or other laws of general applicability affecting
creditors' rights and by general principles of equity that may limit the
specific performance of particular provisions), there currently exists no
circumstance or condition that constitutes an event of default by the Company
or, to the knowledge of the Company and the Shareholders, its lessor or that,
with the passage of time or the giving of notice or both, will or could
constitute such an event of default, and subject to any required consent of the
Company's lessor, each such lease may be assigned to FNB and the execution and
delivery of this Agreement does not constitute an event of default thereunder.

None of the Shareholders or the Company has any knowledge of any type of pending
or threatened legal action affecting the Company's interest in or use of such
Real Property, including, without limitation, any condemnation action. Except as
Previously Disclosed, to the knowledge of the Company and the Shareholders, the
conduct of business by the Company within such Real Property complies with all
applicable legal requirements relating to such Real Property, including, without
limitation, requirements under the applicable zoning ordinances, building code
requirements and any requirements under applicable private restrictions. The
Company's leasehold improvements and fixtures in or on the Real Property are in
good condition.

         5.5 Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities. Except as Previously Disclosed,
the Company has no liabilities or obligations (whether accrued, absolute,
contingent, unliquidated or otherwise, whether due or to become due) other than
(a) liabilities or obligations reserved against or otherwise disclosed in the
Financial Statements, (b) liabilities or obligations under Contracts listed on
the Schedules to this Agreement or under Contracts that are not required to be
disclosed thereon (but not liabilities for breaches thereof), and (c)
liabilities and obligations incurred after December 31, 2001 in the ordinary
course of business consistent (in amount and kind) with past practice. Except as
Previously Disclosed, no facts or circumstances exist that would reasonably be
expected to serve as the basis for any other liabilities or obligations of the
Company.

         5.6 Contracts.

                  (a) The Company has Previously Disclosed to FNB a listing of
         each Contract (other than those arising directly out of the Company's
         mortgage lending activities) to which the Company is party or by which
         it or its properties or assets is bound that (i) involves obligations
         to or by the Company in the future exceeding $2,500; (ii) has a future
         term (excluding any portion subject to a cancelable right exercisable
         without penalty) of one year or more; (iii) contains or pursuant to
         which the Company made warranties of its services that continue in
         effect; (iv) involves hedging, options or any similar trading activity,
         or any interest rate exchanges or swaps (with the exception of letters
         of credit, lines of credit and loan commitments extended in the
         ordinary course of the Company's business); (v) involves the purchase
         or sale of any Assets of the Company in excess of $5,000 in the
         aggregate; or (vi) is otherwise material to the Company.

                  (b) Complete copies (or, if oral, full written descriptions)
         of all Contracts Previously Disclosed to FNB, including all amendments
         thereto, have been delivered to FNB. Each of such Contracts is legal,
         valid, binding, enforceable (except as its enforceability may be
         limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other laws of general
         applicability affecting creditors' rights and by general principles of
         equity that may limit the specific performance of particular
         provisions) and in full force and effect against the Company and, to
         the knowledge of the Shareholders and the Company, the other parties
         thereto.

                  (c) (i) The Company has not committed an uncured event of
         default (unless permanently waived) under any Contract, and no facts or
         circumstances exist that with the passage of time or the giving of
         notice or both would constitute any such event of default. Neither the
         Shareholders nor the Company has received notice (whether oral or

                                     - 15 -

<PAGE>

         written) that the Company is in default under any Contract or of the
         termination thereof. (ii) To the knowledge of the Shareholders and the
         Company, (A) no other party to any Contract has committed an uncured
         event of default (unless permanently waived) under any Contract, and
         (B) no facts or circumstances exist that with the passage of time or
         the giving of notice or both would constitute any such event of
         default. The Company has not given notice to the other party to any
         such Contract that such other party is in default thereunder or of the
         termination thereof.

         5.7 Intellectual Property Rights. (a) The Company owns or has the right
to use (pursuant to license, sublicense, agreement or permission) all
Intellectual Property necessary to conduct its business as currently conducted.
All registered trademarks and patents owned or used by the Company (together
with any application therefor) and all trade names, copyrights and processes
material to the Company's operations have been Previously Disclosed to FNB.
Except Previously Disclosed, the Company has not pledged, mortgaged, assigned,
licensed, granted permission with respect to or otherwise transferred any such
Intellectual Property to any third party. No such item of Intellectual Property
is subject to any outstanding injunction, judgment, order, decree, ruling or
charge, and no action, suit, proceeding, hearing, investigation, charge,
complaint, claim or demand is pending or, to the knowledge of the Shareholders
and the Company, is threatened that challenges the legality, validity, use or
enforceability of any such item of Intellectual Property. Except as Previously
Disclosed, the Company owns all right, title and interest in each such item of
Intellectual Property, free and clear of any encumbrance, lien or other
restriction. None of the Company's rights with respect to any such Intellectual
Property will be terminated, limited or otherwise affected by its execution of
this Agreement or its consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

         5.8 Financial Statements. Except as Previously Disclosed, the Financial
Statements have been prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles, consistently applied. The Financial Statements fairly present the
results of operations and financial position of the Company for the periods and
as of the dates set forth therein.

         5.9 Loans, Accounts, Notes and Other Receivables.

                  (a) Except as Previously Disclosed, all loans, accounts, notes
         and other receivables reflected as assets on the Company's books and
         records (i) have resulted from bona fide business transactions in the
         ordinary course of the Company's operations, (ii) were made in
         accordance with the Company's standard loan policies and procedures,
         and (iii) are owned by the Company free and clear of all liens,
         encumbrances, assignments, participation or repurchase agreements or
         other exceptions to the title or to the ownership or collection rights
         of any other person or entity.

                  (b) All records of the Company regarding all outstanding
         loans, accounts, notes and other receivables, and all other real estate
         owned, are accurate in all material respects, and, with respect to each
         loan which the Company's loan documentation indicates is secured by any
         real or personal property or property rights ("Loan Collateral"), such
         loan is secured by valid, perfected and enforceable liens on all such
         Loan Collateral having the priority described in the Company's records
         of such loan (except as such enforceability may be limited by
         applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or

                                     - 16 -

<PAGE>

         other laws of general applicability affecting creditors' rights and by
         general principles of equity that may limit the specific performance of
         particular provisions). For purposes of making the representation in
         this Section 5.9(b) regarding loans secured by real property, the
         determination as to rights in and to any such real property may be made
         based solely on title insurance policies issued with respect to such
         property, which policies are in full force and effect, valid and
         enforceable in accordance with their terms (except as such
         enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or
         other laws of general applicability affecting creditors' rights and by
         general principles of equity that may limit the specific performance of
         particular provisions) and underwritten by an insurer qualified to
         transact business in the jurisdiction in which such real property
         collateral is located.

                  (c) To the knowledge of the Shareholders and the Company, each
         loan reflected as an asset on the Company's books, and each guaranty
         therefor, is the legal, valid and binding obligation of the obligor or
         guarantor thereon. No defense, offset or counterclaim has been asserted
         with respect to any such loan guaranty.

                  (d) Except as Previously Disclosed, neither the Company nor
         any Shareholder has reason to believe that any of the Company's loans
         and other extensions of credit is not collectible in the ordinary
         course of the Company's business in an amount that is at least the
         amount at which it is carried on the Company's books and records.

                  (e) The Company maintains a reserve for possible loan losses
         and contingent liabilities, which reserve has been established in
         conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, sound lending
         practices and Applicable Law and, in the judgment of the Company and
         the Shareholders, is reasonable in view of the size and character of
         its loan portfolio, current economic conditions and other relevant
         factors, and is adequate to provide for losses relating to, or the risk
         of loss inherent in, its loan portfolio or its obligations to
         repurchase loans. At December 31, 2002, the Company's reserve for
         possible loan losses and contingent liabilities was $195,954.

         5.10 Securities Portfolio and Investments. All securities owned by the
Company (whether owned of record or beneficially) have been Previously Disclosed
to FNB and, except as Previously Disclosed, are held free and clear of all
mortgages, liens, pledges, encumbrances or any other restriction or rights of
any other person or entity, whether contractual or statutory, which would impair
the ability of the Company to dispose freely of any such security or otherwise
to realize the benefits of ownership thereof at any time (other than in
connection with any repurchase agreements with customers). There are no voting
trusts or other agreements or undertakings to which the Company is a party with
respect to the voting of any such securities. With respect to all "repurchase
agreements" to which the Company has "repurchased" securities under agreement to
resell (if any), the Company has a valid, perfected first lien or security
interest in the government securities or other collateral securing the
repurchase agreement, and the value of the collateral securing each such
repurchase agreement equals or exceeds the amount of the debt owed to the
Company which is secured by such collateral.

         Except for fluctuations in the market values of its investment
securities, since December 31, 2001, there has been no significant deterioration
or material adverse change in the quality, or any material decrease in the
value, of the Company's securities portfolio.

         5.11 Legal Compliance. Except as Previously Disclosed, the Company is
in compliance in all material respects with all Applicable Laws, and no facts or
circumstances exist that, with or without the passing of time or the giving of
notice or both, would reasonably be expected to serve as the basis for any claim
that the Company is not in compliance in any material respect with an Applicable
Law. Except as Previously Disclosed, the Company has not received any written
communication from a Governmental Authority that remains pending alleging its
noncompliance with any Applicable Law.

         5.12 Taxes and Tax Returns.

                  (a) The Company has duly and timely filed (including within
         any applicable extension periods) all Tax Returns required to be filed
         by it prior to the date hereof and has duly paid such taxes that are
         due. All such Tax Returns are true, correct and complete in all
         material respects. Except as Previously Disclosed, since December 31,
         1996, the Company has not incurred any liability for Taxes other than
         in the ordinary course of business. The Company has Previously
         Disclosed to FNB all periods since December 31, 1996 for which the
         federal income tax returns of the Company has been examined by the
         Internal Revenue Service, and all deficiencies asserted as a result of
         such examinations (or as a result of any examination of such returns
         for earlier fiscal years) have been paid or finally settled. There are
         no disputes pending in respect of or claims asserted for Taxes, nor are
         there any pending or, to the knowledge of the Shareholders and the
         Company, threatened audits or investigations or outstanding matters
         under discussion with any taxing authorities with respect to the
         payment of Taxes or the Company's Tax Returns, nor has the Company
         given or been requested to give any currently effective waivers
         extending the statutory period of limitation applicable to any Taxes
         for any period. Except as Previously Disclosed, no issues that have
         been raised by any taxing authority in connection with any Taxes or Tax
         Returns of the Company are of a recurring nature that would apply to
         Taxes or such Tax Returns after the Closing. All required declarations
         of estimated income taxes related to the operations of the Company have
         been made, and all Taxes required to be shown on such declarations have
         been paid. Copies of all Income Tax Returns relating to the operations
         of the Company for all periods since December 31, 1996 have been
         delivered to the FNB.

                  (b) No facts exist or have existed that would reasonably be
         expected to constitute grounds for the assessment of Taxes against the
         Company beyond the reserves for Taxes shown on the Financial
         Statements.

                  (c) There are no liens with respect to Taxes (except for liens
         for taxes, assessments or other governmental charges not yet
         delinquent) upon any of the Company's Assets.

                  (d) Since January 1, 1987, the Company has had in effect a
         valid election under Section 1362(a)(1) of the Code to be taxed as a
         "Subchapter S" corporation under

                                     - 18 -

         Section 1361(a)(1) of the Code. In no year has the Company incurred any
         tax liability under Section 1374 or 1375 of the Code.

                  (e) The Company has not been and will not be liable for the
         tax of any Person relating to conduct or operations prior to the
         Closing Date under Section 1.1502-6 of the Treasury Regulations
         promulgated pursuant to the Code (or any similar provision of state,
         local or foreign law) as a transferee or successor, by contract or
         otherwise.

         5.13 Litigation. There are no lawsuits, claims, or legal,
administrative or arbitration proceedings or investigations pending or, to the
knowledge of the Shareholders and the Company, threatened by or against or
affecting the Company or any of the Company's Assets, operations or business.

         5.14 Labor and Employment Matters.

                  (a) The Company has delivered to FNB complete and accurate
         copies (or, if oral, full written descriptions) of each employment,
         consulting and similar agreement to which the Company is a party, all
         of which have been Previously Disclosed. Except as Previously
         Disclosed, the Company is not a party to or bound by any agreement, any
         employment manual, employment handbook, employment practice or policy
         constituting a contractual obligation, or any consent decree, court
         order or statutory obligation: (i) for the employment of any

                  (b) The Company is not a party to any collective bargaining
         agreement, and has not recognized or received a demand for recognition
         of any collective bargaining representative with respect thereto; and
         during the past three years there have been no material labor strikes,
         disputes or work stoppages nor, to the knowledge of the Shareholders
         and the Company, are any such actions threatened against the Company.

                  (c) Except as Previously Disclosed, there are no loans or
         other obligations payable or owing to any officers, directors or
         employees of the Company, except salaries, wages, bonuses and salary
         advances and reimbursement of expenses incurred and accrued in the
         ordinary course of business, nor are any loans or debts payable or
         owing by any such persons or their Affiliates to the Company, nor has
         the Company guaranteed any of their loans or obligations.

         all laws and other obligations relating to employment, denial of
         employment or employment opportunity and termination of employment.

                  (e) There is no material controversy pending or, to the
         knowledge of the Company and the Shareholders, threatened between the
         Company and any of its present or former officers, directors,
         supervisory personnel or any group of its employees.

         any person for prohibited transactions or breach of fiduciary
         responsibility under ERISA or the Code (including, without limitation,
         liability for a breach of fiduciary responsibility by a cofiduciary
         pursuant to Section 405 of ERISA).

                  (c) Funding. Except as Previously Disclosed, full payment has

         under any Plan, or (iii) acceleration of the time of payment or vesting

         benefits accrued as liabilities on the books of the Company, or (v)
         benefits for which the full cost is borne by the current or former

risks as is required by applicable law or regulations, and in the reasonable
opinion of the Shareholders and the Company, the insurance coverage provided
under these Policies is reasonable and adequate in all respects for the Company.
Each of the Policies is in full force and effect and is valid and enforceable in
accordance with its terms (except as such enforceability may be limited by
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other laws of general applicability

the specific performance of particular provisions) and is underwritten by an
insurer qualified to transact business in North Carolina. The Company has taken

such claim.

                  (n) agree, whether in writing or otherwise, to do any of the
         foregoing.

         7.2 Covenants of the Shareholders.

                  (a) Transfer of Shares. Between the date hereof and the
         earlier of the Closing or the date on which this Agreement is
         terminated, each Shareholder shall not transfer, pledge, hypothecate or
         otherwise encumber any of the Company Shares owned by him or grant to
         any Person any right to purchase any of the Company Shares other than
         the rights granted to FNB hereunder.

                  (b) Restricted Stock. The FNB Shares to be issued in
         connection with the Merger have not been registered under the
         Securities Act, and each Shareholder will not offer, sell, pledge or
         otherwise transfer any of such FNB Shares except pursuant to an
         effective registration statement or in accordance with an applicable
         exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and
         in accordance with any applicable securities laws of any state of the
         United States or any other jurisdiction. FNB shall have the right to
         require the delivery of an opinion of counsel in form and substance
         reasonably satisfactory to FNB, prior to any transfer in accordance
         with an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities
         Act, to the effect that such transfer is exempt from such registration
         requirements.

                  (c) Release. Each Shareholder (in his capacity as employee,
         shareholder, officer or director, or otherwise) hereby releases and
         forever discharges the Company, FNB, Surviving Corporation and their
         Affiliates, and each of their shareholders, directors, officers,
         employees, agents and successors and assigns (all of such parties,
         collectively, the "Released Parties"), from any and all claims,
         demands, proceedings, causes of action, orders, obligations, contracts,
         agreements, debts and liabilities whatsoever, whether known or unknown,
         fixed or contingent, both at law and in equity, other than as may arise
         under and are brought in connection with this Agreement, that such
         Shareholder has, ever had or may hereafter have against any of the
         Released Parties based on facts, circumstances, events or omissions
         occurring prior to the Closing, whether or not relating to claims
         pending on or asserted after the Closing; provided, however, that this
         Section 7.2(c) shall become effective only upon the Closing. Each
         Shareholder hereby covenants to refrain from, directly or indirectly,
         asserting any claim or demand, or commencing, instituting or causing to
         be commenced, any proceeding of any kind against any Released Party
         based upon any matters purported to be released hereby. Notwithstanding
         the foregoing, the release set forth in this Section 7.2(c) shall not
         (i) apply to any claims or rights that any Shareholder may have against
         a Released Party with respect to which proceeds have been paid under an
         insurance policy held by or on behalf of the Surviving Corporation,
         (ii) affect employment-related benefits to which the Company has
         committed prior to Closing or is required by law to provide, or (iii)
         affect director and officer indemnity and advancement rights to which
         any Shareholder would otherwise have a right under applicable corporate
         law or the Company's governing charter documents. Further,
         notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section
         7.2(c), the release set forth herein shall not apply to any claims or
         rights that any Shareholder may have against any other Shareholder of
         any kind or nature whatsoever.

         7.3 Covenants of FNB.

                  (a) Merger Sub Organization. FNB shall organize Merger Sub
         under the laws of the State of North Carolina prior to the Effective
         Time. The outstanding capital stock of Merger Sub shall consist of
         1,000 shares of common stock, all of which will be owned by FNB. Prior
         to the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall not (i) conduct any business
         operations whatsoever or (ii) enter into any contract or agreement of
         any kind, acquire any assets, or incur any liability, except as may be
         expressly contemplated by this Agreement or the Plan of Merger or as
         FNB and Company may otherwise agree. FNB, as the sole shareholder of
         Merger Sub, shall vote prior to the Effective Time the shares of common
         stock of Merger Sub in favor of the Plan of Merger and shall take all
         such other actions as shall be necessary for Merger Sub to consummate
         the transactions described herein. At the Effective Time, Merger Sub
         shall be a corporation duly organized and validly existing under the
         laws of the State of North Carolina with the corporate power and
         authority necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by the
         Plan of Merger.

                  (b) Listing of Additional Shares. FNB will notify the Nasdaq
         Stock Market of the listing of the shares of the FNB Shares to be
         issued in connection with the Merger as soon as practicable following
         the Closing Date.

                  (c) Compliance with Rule 144. For a period of two years after
         the Closing Date, FNB will use its reasonable best efforts to comply
         with the requirements of Rule 144, promulgated by the Securities and
         Exchange Commission pursuant to the Securities Act, necessary for the
         Shareholders to sell the FNB Shares received hereunder under Rule 144
         after the expiration of any applicable holding period thereunder.

                  (d) Registration Rights. In connection with any underwritten
         public offering of the FNB Shares in respect of which a registration
         statement has been filed under the Securities Act on Form S-1 or S-3,
         at the option of the underwriter(s) thereof, the sale of the FNB Shares
         received by the Shareholders hereunder shall be covered by such
         registration statement.

         7.4 Sale of Investment Securities. Prior to the Closing, the Company
shall sell and liquidate its investment securities, converting them solely into
Cash.

         7.5 Tax Matters. Each of the parties hereto shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause the Merger to qualify as a "reorganization" within the
meaning of Section 368(a)(2)(D) of the Code and shall not intentionally take any
action that would cause the Merger to fail to so qualify. All items of income,
loss, deduction and credit of the Company from January 1, 2003 to the Effective
Time shall be allocated to the Shareholders. The Shareholders and Company shall
execute such tax returns and elections as may be reasonably required by FNB to
effect such allocations.

         7.6 Consummation of Agreement. The Company, the Shareholders, and FNB
shall use their reasonable best efforts to perform or fulfill all conditions and
obligations to be performed or fulfilled by them under this Agreement so that
the transactions contemplated

                                     - 30 -

<PAGE>

hereby shall be consummated. Except for events that are the subject of specific
provisions of this Agreement, if any event should occur, either within or
outside the control of the Company, the Shareholders, or FNB that would
materially delay or prevent fulfillment of the conditions upon the obligations
of any party hereto to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, each party will notify the others of any such event and the parties
will use their reasonable, diligent and good faith efforts to cure or minimize
the same as expeditiously as possible.

         7.7 Schedules to Agreement. Each party will promptly notify the other
parties of any event, fact or other circumstance arising after the date hereof
that would have caused the representations or warranties, or the disclosure
schedules delivered under this Agreement to be untrue or misleading had such
event, fact or circumstance arisen prior to the delivery of such schedules or
the making of such representation.

         7.8 Corporate Action. The Company and FNB will, and FNB shall cause
Merger Sub to, take all corporate action necessary to consummate this Agreement
and the Merger. The Shareholders as shareholders of the Company shall take all
action necessary for the Company to consummate and give effect to the Merger.

         7.9 Maintenance of Corporate Existence. The Company and FNB shall, and
the Shareholders shall cause the Company through Closing to, maintain in full
force and effect their respective corporate existences.

         7.10 No Solicitation. In recognition of the time that will be expended
and the expense which will be incurred by FNB in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, the Company and the Shareholders will not, and
the Company will cause its officers, employees and agents not to, directly or
indirectly or through agents, brokers or otherwise, until this Agreement is
closed or is terminated as provided in this Agreement, encourage, solicit,
engage in negotiations or discussions with or provide information with respect
to any inquiries or proposals relating to (a) the possible direct or indirect
acquisition of all or a portion of the Company's capital stock or its assets or
(b) any business combination with the Company. Additionally, the Shareholders
and the Company shall promptly notify FNB upon receipt of any inquiries by a
third Person relating to the foregoing subclauses (a) and (b).

         7.11 Qualified Plans. The Company shall take all appropriate action as
shall be necessary to maintain the Dover Mortgage Company 401(k) Profit Sharing
Plan (the "Dover 401(k) Plan") as a qualified plan for purposes of ERISA. The
Company and the Shareholders acknowledge that FNB intends that the Dover 401(k)
Plan will be merged into FNB's Section 401(k) Savings Plan (the "FNB 401(k)
Plan") as soon as practicable after the Closing. The Company shall take all such
actions with respect to such plan as shall be necessary to accomplish such
intent and, until the Closing, will not take any other extraordinary actions
with respect to such plan without the written consent of FNB.

         7.12 Employment.

                  (a) J. Edward Joye, Jr. Provided he remains employed as
         President of the Company as of the time of the Closing, the Surviving
         Corporation shall enter into an

                                     - 31 -

<PAGE>

         employment agreement with J. Edward Joye, Jr. as of the Closing, which
         shall contain substantially the same terms and conditions and be in
         substantially the same form as is attached hereto as Exhibit B1.

                  (b) Joseph Keels III. Provided he remains employed as Chief
         Accounting Officer of the Company as of the time of the Closing, the
         Surviving Corporation shall enter into an employment agreement with
         Joseph Keels III as of the Closing, which shall contain substantially
         the same terms and conditions and be in substantially the same form as
         is attached hereto as Exhibit B2.

         7.13 Employee Benefits.

                  (a) Generally. Except as otherwise provided herein and to the
         extent permitted by contribution and deduction limitations of ERISA and
         the Code with respect to FNB's qualified plans, any employee of the
         Company who continues employment with the Surviving Corporation, FNB or
         an Affiliate of FNB at the time of the Closing (a "New Employee") shall
         become entitled to receive all employee benefits and to participate in
         all benefit plans provided by FNB or First National, on the same basis
         and subject to the same eligibility and vesting requirements, and to
         the same conditions, restrictions and limitations, as generally are in
         effect and applicable to other newly hired employees of FNB or First
         National. However, each New Employee shall be given credit for his or
         her full years of service with the Company for purposes of (i)
         entitlement to vacation and sick leave and for participation in all FNB
         or First National welfare, insurance and other fringe benefit plans,
         and (ii) eligibility for participation and vesting in the FNB 401(k)
         Plan and in FNB's defined benefit pension plan (the "FNB Pension
         Plan"). Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, FNB will
         not be required to take any action that could adversely affect the
         continuing qualification of the FNB 401(k) Plan or the FNB Pension
         Plan. FNB will grant to each New Employee a pro rata amount of sick
         leave and vacation leave, in accordance with FNB's standard leave
         policies, for the period between the Closing Date and the end of the
         calendar year during which the Closing Date occurs. Each New Employee
         will be permitted to carry over accrued and unused sick leave and
         vacation leave earned at the Company but shall thereafter be subject to
         FNB's leave policies.

                  (b) Health Insurance. Each New Employee shall be entitled to
         participate in First National's group health insurance plan at a cost
         equal to the cost for any First National employee and such
         participation shall be without regard to pre-existing condition
         requirements under First National's group health insurance plan, to the
         extent any such condition at the time of the Closing would have been
         covered under the health insurance plans of the Company.

         7.14 Retention Bonus.

                  (a) One Year Bonus. FNB shall cause the Surviving Corporation
         to pay to each employee of the Company identified in writing by FNB and
         the Company prior to the Closing a retention bonus in the amount
         likewise agreed upon in writing by FNB and the Company before the
         Closing as soon as practicable following the first anniversary of

                                     - 32 -

<PAGE>

         the Closing Date provided he or she remains employed by the Surviving
         Corporation from the Closing through the first anniversary of the
         Closing Date. The aggregate amount of retention bonuses payable by the
         Surviving Corporation at such time should all such identified employees
         satisfy the retention requirement set forth in this Section 7.14(a)
         shall be equal to $180,000.

                  (b) Three-Year Bonus. FNB shall cause the Surviving
         Corporation to pay to each employee of the Company identified in
         writing by FNB and the Company prior to the Closing a retention bonus
         in the amount likewise agreed upon in writing by FNB and the Company
         before the Closing as soon as practicable following the third
         anniversary of the Closing Date provided he or she remains employed by
         the Surviving Corporation from the Closing through the third
         anniversary of the Closing Date. The aggregate amount of retention
         bonuses payable by the Surviving Corporation at such time should all
         such identified employees satisfy the retention requirement set forth
         in this Section 7.14(b) shall be equal to $600,000.

                  (c) No Employment Contract. This Section 7.14 shall not be
         deemed a contract of employment and each such employee's employment
         with the Company following the Closing will be on an "at will" basis.

         7.15 Noncompetition.

                  (a) Period and Conduct. As further consideration for the
         Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, during the
         five-year period following the Closing Date, the Shareholders (other
         than J. Edward Joye, Jr., who is entering into a similar covenant
         pursuant to the employment agreement referred to in Section 7.12(a))
         shall not:

                           (i) compete with the Surviving Corporation or FNB in
                  the business of mortgage banking, including originating,
                  processing, underwriting or closing mortgage loans;

                           (ii) solicit or accept business of any kind relating
                  to mortgage banking or the origination, processing,
                  underwriting or closing of mortgage loans from any customer,
                  former customer or active prospect of the Surviving
                  Corporation or FNB;

                           (iii) solicit any employee of the Surviving
                  Corporation or FNB to terminate his or her employment with the
                  Surviving Corporation or FNB; or

                           (iv) incorporate or otherwise create any business
                  organization utilizing any name which uses the word "Dover" or
                  which is confusingly similar to "Dover."

                  (b) Territory. Each Shareholder shall refrain from engaging in
         the activities described in this Section 7.15 during the period
         specified in Section 7.15(a) hereof in North Carolina and South
         Carolina.

<PAGE>

                  (c) Definition. Each Shareholder shall be deemed to be
         competing with the Surviving Corporation or FNB if he is engaged or
         participates in any business or businesses described in Section
         7.15(a), directly or indirectly, whether for his own account or for
         that of any other person, firm or corporation, public or private, and
         whether as a shareholder, partner or investor possessing an ownership
         interest exceeding 1% in any such entity or as principal, agent,
         representative, proprietor, partner, officer, director, employee or
         consultant or in any other capacity.

                  (d) Reasonableness. The Shareholders have reviewed the scope,
         duration and geographical scope of the covenants made in this Section
         7.15 and acknowledge that they are reasonable and necessary to protect
         the legitimate business interests of the Surviving Corporation and FNB.

                  (e) Remedies. Inasmuch as any breach of, or failure to comply
         with, this Section 7.15 will cause serious and substantial damage to
         the Surviving Corporation and FNB if any Shareholder should in any way
         breach, or fail to comply with, the terms of this Section 7.15, FNB and
         the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to an injunction
         restraining such Shareholder from such breach or failure. All remedies
         expressly provided for herein are cumulative of any and all other
         remedies now existing at law or in equity. FNB and the Surviving
         Corporation shall, in addition to the remedies herein provided, be
         entitled to avail themselves itself of all such other remedies as may
         now or hereafter exist at law or in equity for compensation, and for
         the specific enforcement of the covenants contained herein. Resort to
         any remedy provided for hereunder or provided for by law shall not
         prevent the concurrent or subsequent employment of any other
         appropriate remedy or remedies, or preclude the recovery by the
         Surviving Corporation and the Company of monetary damages and
         compensation.

                  (f) Subsidiaries, Divisions and Affiliates. For the purposes
         of this Section 7.15, "FNB" and "the Surviving Corporation" shall
         include their respective subsidiaries, divisions and Affiliates as they
         may exist from time to time.

                  (g) Enforceability. The Shareholders, the Surviving
         Corporation and FNB intend that this Section 7.15 be enforced as
         written. However, if one or more of the provisions contained in this
         Section 7.15 shall for any reason be held to be unenforceable because
         of the duration or scope of such provision or the area covered thereby,
         the parties agree that the court making such determination shall have
         the power to reform the duration, scope and/or area of such provision
         and in its reformed form such provision shall then be enforceable and
         shall be binding on the parties.

         7.16 Termination of Guaranties. FNB shall cooperate with the
Shareholders to obtain the termination as of the Effective Time of (i) the
Guaranty Agreements, dated as of September 22, 1997, given by each of the

Pledge and Security Agreement, dated as of September 22, 1997, among the
Shareholders and Bank of America, N.A., permitting the release of the

purpose other than the transactions contemplated hereby, the subject matter or
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or information pertaining to the
Company, with any other Person without the prior consent of the other parties

         seeks to enjoin or prohibit the transactions contemplated hereby. Any
         party who is subject to any such order, decree or injunction or the
         subject of any such suit or proceeding shall take any steps within that
         party's control to cause any such order, decree or injunction to be
         modified so as to permit the Closing and to cause any such suit or
         proceeding to be dismissed.

                  (b) Consents. All permits, authorizations, consents and
         approvals of Governmental Authorities necessary for the consummation of
         the transactions contemplated hereby have been obtained and Bank of
         America, N.A. shall have provided the terminations and releases
         contemplated by Section 7.16.

         Abel & Livingston P.L.L.C. or another tax advisor in form and substance
         satisfactory to the Company and FNB, substantially to the effect that,
         for federal income tax purposes: (i) consummation of the Merger will
         constitute a "reorganization" as defined in Section 368(a) of the Code;
         (ii) no gain or loss will be recognized by the Company or FNB by reason
         of the Merger; and (iii) the exchange or cancellation of the Company
         Shares in the Merger will not give rise to recognition of gain or loss
         for federal income tax purposes to the shareholders of the Company to
         the extent such shareholders receive FNB Shares in exchange for their
         Company Shares (except with respect to cash in lieu of fractional
         shares). Schell Bray Aycock Abel & Livingston P.L.L.C. or such other
         tax advisor will require and rely on representations by officers of FNB
         and the Company and will be entitled to make reasonable assumptions.

<PAGE>

                  (a) Subject to the limitations set forth in this Section 11.2,
         the Shareholders hereby agree jointly and severally to indemnify,
         defend and hold harmless FNB, the Surviving Corporation, and any of
         their Affiliates, and all officers, directors, equity holders,
         employees and agents thereof (all of such parties, collectively, the
         "FNB Affiliates"), from and against all demands, claims, actions,
         losses, damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including, without
         limitation, settlement costs, arbitration costs and any reasonable
         legal and other expenses for investigating or defending any action or
         threatened action) incurred by any of the FNB Affiliates arising out of
         or in connection with or resulting from (i) a breach of any covenant,
         agreement, representation or warranty of the Company or any Shareholder
         contained in this Agreement or in any agreement or instrument executed
         and delivered pursuant to this Agreement on or prior to the Closing or
         (ii) Taxes that are assessed on or incurred by the Surviving
         Corporation or the Shareholders (or any successor thereof) on the basis
         of action, facts, circumstances, events or omissions occurring prior to
         the Closing (collectively, "FNB's Damages").

                  (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to FNB's
         Damages arising from breaches of representations and warranties (except
         those made in Sections 5.1(a) through (e), 5.2, 5.12 and 5.15 and the
         first sentence of Section 5.3, to which this Section 11.2(b) shall not
         apply): (i) the Shareholders, jointly and severally, shall be obligated
         to indemnify the FNB Affiliates in the aggregate only up to the amount
         of the Gross Cash Consideration plus the amount of any earn-out
         payments as may be paid to the Shareholders pursuant to Section 3.5;
         (ii) a FNB Affiliate must have given the Shareholders written notice of
         any such breaches within the applicable survival period as set forth in
         Section 11.1; and (iii) the Shareholders will not be liable for any
         such FNB's Damages unless and until the aggregate amount of such FNB's
         Damages exceeds $50,000 (at which time the Shareholders will be
         obligated to pay only those sums in excess of such initial $50,000).
         Further notwithstanding the foregoing, the Shareholders will have no
         liability with respect to FNB's Damages to the extent of any insurance
         proceeds received by, or direct tax benefits available to, the
         Surviving Corporation or FNB in connection therewith; provided,
         however, that any such insurance proceeds received or tax benefits
         available shall not be taken into account and shall not reduce FNB's
         Damages for the purpose of determining whether the threshold of $50,000
         (as described above) has been met. (c) This Section 11.2 and FNB's
         rights to indemnification shall be FNB's sole and exclusive remedy for
         a breach of the representations and warranties made by the Company or
         the Shareholders and contained in this Agreement or any document or
         Schedule delivered in connection herewith; provided, however, that FNB
         shall be entitled to set-off any FNB's Damages against any earn-out
         payments owing under Section 3.5 upon compliance with the
         indemnification procedure set forth in Section 11.4.

         11.3 FNB's Agreement to Indemnify. Subject to the limitations set forth
in this Section 11.3, FNB hereby agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless
the Shareholders from and against all demands, claims, actions, losses, damages,
liabilities, costs and expenses (including, without limitation, settlement
costs, arbitration costs and any reasonable legal and other expenses for
investigating or defending any action or threatened action) incurred by the
Shareholders arising out of or in connection with or resulting from a breach of
any covenant, agreement,

                                     - 41 -

<PAGE>

representation or warranty of the FNB contained in this Agreement or in any
agreement or instrument executed and delivered pursuant to this Agreement on or
prior to the Closing to the extent that such representation, warranty or
covenant survives the Closing and a claim therefor is presented to FNB in
accordance with this Agreement before the expiration of the applicable survival
period as set forth in Section 11.1. This Section 11.3 shall and Shareholders'
rights to indemnification shall be the Shareholders' sole and exclusive remedy
for a breach of FNB's representations and warranties contained in this Agreement
or any document delivered in connection herewith.

         11.4 Indemnification Procedure.

                  (a) Notice. Each indemnified party shall give the indemnifying
         party prompt written notice of any action, claim, demand, discovery of
         fact, proceeding or suit (collectively, "Demands" and each notice, a
         "Demand Notice") for which such indemnified party intends to assert a
         right to indemnification under this Agreement, including Demands for
         which the indemnified party would intend to assert a right to
         indemnification but for the de minimis amount contemplated by Section
         11.2(b) hereof. Each Demand Notice shall set forth in reasonable detail
         the nature and amount of the damages sought. The indemnifying party
         shall, within 30 days of receipt of a Demand Notice, pay to the
         indemnified party the amount set forth in such Demand Notice or, if the
         indemnifying party disputes in good faith the Demand or the amount
         thereof, deliver to the indemnified party a written objection setting
         forth the basis for disputing the Demand or payment. If within 30 days
         after receipt by an indemnified party of the objection notice to a
         Demand Notice the parties shall not have reached agreement as to the
         Demand or amount in question, the claim for indemnification shall be
         submitted to one arbitrator selected from the panel of arbitrators of
         the American Arbitration Association, or if FNB and the Shareholders
         cannot agree on the arbitrator, by three arbitrators selected from such
         panel, one of whom shall be chosen by FNB, one of whom shall be chosen
         by the Shareholders and the third of whom shall be chosen by the two
         arbitrators so chosen. If either FNB or the Shareholders shall not have
         designated such an arbitrator within 20 days after submission by the
         American Arbitration Association of the list of names of arbitrators
         selected from its panel, the resolution of the contested Demand Notice
         shall be made by the arbitrator chosen by the other party. Arbitration
         will be held in Asheboro, North Carolina, or such other location in
         North Carolina as the parties may agree, and shall be conducted in
         accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American
         Arbitration Association then in effect. The decision of the
         arbitrator(s), including the awarding to the prevailing party of its

                  (b) Third Party Claims. The indemnifying party shall have the
         right to participate jointly with the indemnified party in the
         indemnified party's defense, settlement or other disposition of any
         Demand that arises from any claim or assertion made by a third party.
         With respect to any such Demand relating solely to the payment of money
         damages and which will not result in the indemnified party's becoming
         subject to injunctive or other relief or otherwise adversely affect the
         business of the indemnified party in any manner, and as to which the
         indemnifying party shall have acknowledged in writing the obligation to
         indemnify the indemnified party hereunder, the indemnifying party shall
         have the sole right to defend, settle or otherwise dispose of such
         Demand, on such terms as the indemnifying party, in its sole
         discretion, shall deem appropriate. The indemnifying party shall obtain
         the written consent of the indemnified party, which shall not be
         unreasonably withheld, prior to ceasing to defend, settling or
         otherwise disposing of any such Demand if as a result thereof, the
         indemnified party would become subject to injunctive or other equitable
         relief or the business of the indemnified party would be adversely
         affected in any manner.

                                 PLAN OF MERGER
                                       OF
                             DOVER MORTGAGE COMPANY
                                  WITH AND INTO
                              DMC ACQUISITION CORP.

     A. Parties to Merger. The parties to the proposed merger are Dover Mortgage
Company, a North Carolina corporation ("Dover"), FNB Corp., a North Carolina
corporation ("FNB"), and DMC Acquisition Corp., a North Carolina corporation and
wholly owned subsidiary of FNB (the "Merger Subsidiary").

     B. Nature of Transaction. Subject to the provisions of this Plan of Merger,
Dover shall be merged with and into the Merger Subsidiary (the "Merger") with
the effect provided in the North Carolina Business Corporation Act.

     C. Surviving Corporation. The Merger Subsidiary shall be the surviving
corporation in the Merger. At the Effective Time (as hereinafter defined) of the
Merger, the name of the surviving corporation shall be changed to "Dover
Mortgage Company."

     D. Effective Time. This Plan of Merger shall be effective upon the filing
of Articles of Merger with respect hereto with the North Carolina Secretary of
State (the "Effective Time"). At the Effective Time, the separate corporate
existence of Dover shall cease and the corporate existence of the Merger
Subsidiary shall continue with all of its purposes, objects, rights, privileges,
powers and franchises, all of which shall be unaffected and unimpaired by the
Merger.

     E. Conversion and Exchange of Shares.

        1. Each share of Common Stock, par value $2.50 per share, of FNB ("FNB
Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
continue to be issued and outstanding and shall not be affected by the Merger.

        2. Each share of capital stock of the Merger Subsidiary issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall continue to be an
issued and outstanding share of the Merger Subsidiary, as the surviving
corporation, from and after the Merger.

        3. Except as otherwise provided herein, at the Effective Time, all
rights of Dover's shareholders with respect to all then outstanding shares of
the common stock of Dover, no par value ("Dover Stock"), shall cease to exist,
and the holders of Dover Stock shall cease to be, and shall have no further
rights as, shareholders of Dover. At the Effective Time, each outstanding share
of Dover Stock shall be converted, without any action of the part of the holders
of such shares, into the right to receive the Closing Cash Consideration (as
defined below), the Closing Stock Consideration (as defined below) and the
Post-Closing Consideration (as defined below):



<PAGE>

           (a) Closing Cash Consideration. In addition to being converted into
        the right to receive the Closing Stock Consideration and the
        Post-Closing Consideration, each such issued and outstanding share of
        Dover Stock shall also be converted into the right to receive $________
        in cash, without interest (the "Closing Cash Consideration"). [This
        amount is to be calculated in accordance with Section 3.3(a) of the
        Merger Agreement among FNB, Dover and the shareholders of Dover and
        reflected in this Plan of Merger prior to filing with the North Carolina
        Secretary of State.]

           (b) Closing Stock Consideration. In addition to being converted into
        the right to receive the Closing Cash Consideration and the Post-Closing
        Consideration, each such issued and outstanding share of Dover Stock
        shall also be converted into the right to receive _________ shares of
        FNB Stock (the "Closing Stock Consideration"). [This amount is to be
        determined in accordance with Section 3.3(b) of the Merger Agreement
        among FNB, Dover and the shareholders of Dover and reflected in this
        Plan of Merger prior to filing with the North Carolina Secretary of
        State.]

           (c) Post-Closing Cash Consideration. In addition to being converted
        into the right to receive the Closing Cash Consideration, the Closing
        Stock Consideration and the Post-Closing Stock Consideration (as defined
        below), each such issued and outstanding shares of Dover Stock shall
        also be converted into the right to receive the following amount of
        cash, without interest (the "Post-Closing Cash Consideration"):

               (i) the "Post-Closing Gross Cash Consideration," which shall be
           equal to fifty percent (50%) of the sum of (A) the 2003 Net Income
           (as hereinafter defined), plus (B) the amount obtained by subtracting
           (x) the amount of the Reserve (as hereinafter defined) from (y)
           $250,000, divided by

               (ii) the number of shares of Dover Stock issued and outstanding
           immediately prior to the Effective Time.

           (d) Post-Closing Stock Consideration. In addition to being converted
        into the right to receive the Closing Cash Consideration, the Closing
        Stock Consideration and the Post-Closing Cash Consideration, each such
        issued and outstanding share of Dover Stock shall also be converted into
        the right to receive the following amount of FNB Shares (the
        "Post-Closing Stock Consideration"):

               (i) the lesser of (A) the number of FNB Shares with a value,
           based on the Average Closing Price (as hereinafter defined), of the
           Post-Closing Gross Cash Consideration, and (B) the quotient obtained
           by dividing the Post-Closing Gross Cash Consideration by $17.50,
           divided by

               (ii) the number of shares of Dover Stock issued and outstanding
           immediately prior to the Effective Time.

                                       2

     "Post-Closing Consideration" means the sum of the Post-Closing Cash

with the Merger.

        4. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan of Merger, each
holder of shares of Dover Stock exchanged pursuant to the Merger who would
otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of FNB Stock
(after taking into account all certificates delivered by such holder) shall
receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount equal to such
fractional part of a share of FNB Stock multiplied by the Average Closing Price.
No such holder will be entitled to dividends, voting rights, or any other rights
as a shareholder in respect of any fractional shares.

        5. Each holder of a certificate representing shares to be converted or
exchanged in the Merger shall surrender such certificate and after the Effective
Time shall be entitled to receive in exchange for such certificate the amount of
cash and the number of shares of FNB Stock to which it is entitled under this
Plan of Merger. Until so surrendered, each outstanding certificate that prior to
the Effective Time represented shares of Dover Stock will be deemed for all
purposes to evidence only the right of the holder thereof to receive the
consideration to be issued and paid for such shares under this Plan of Merger.

     F. Abandonment. This Plan of Merger may be terminated and the Merger may be
abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time upon termination of the Merger

date of death. In such event, the Company shall pay the Employee's Base Salary,
at the rate in effect at the time of his death

                                       -2-

<PAGE>

and through the last day of the calendar month in which such death occurs, to
the Employee's designated beneficiary, or, in the absence of such designation,
to the estate or other legal representative of the Employee. Any rights and
benefits the Employee's estate or any other person may have under employee
benefit plans and programs of the Company or FNB in the event of the Employee's
death shall be determined in accordance with the terms of such plans and
programs.

        (b) Long-Term Disability. If the Employee suffers any disability while
employed under this Agreement that prevents him from performing his duties under
this Agreement for a period of 90 consecutive days, then, unless otherwise then
agreed in writing by the parties hereto, the employment of the Employee under
this Agreement shall, at the election of the Company, be terminated effective as
of the ninetieth day of such period. Upon termination of the Employee's
employment by reason of disability under this Section 5(b), the Employee shall
be entitled to receive his Base Salary, at the rate in effect on the date of
such termination, less any disability insurance payments paid to the Employee on
a policy maintained for the benefit of the Employee by the Company or FNB,
through the end of the then current term of this Agreement. Any rights and
benefits the Employee may have under employee benefit plans and programs of the
Company or FNB in the event of the Employee's disability shall be determined in
accordance with the terms of such plans and programs.

        For purposes of this Agreement, "disability" shall mean the inability,
by reason of bodily injury or physical or mental disease, or any combination
thereof, of the Employee to perform his customary or other comparable duties
with the Company. In the event that the Employee and the Company are unable to
agree as to whether the Employee is suffering a disability, the Employee and the
Company shall each select a physician and the two physicians so chosen shall
make the determination or, if they are unable to agree, they shall select a
third physician, and the determination as to whether the Employee is suffering a
disability shall be based upon the determination of a majority of the three
physicians. The Company shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of all
physicians selected pursuant to this Section 5(b).

        (c) Termination for Cause. Nothing herein shall prevent the Company from
terminating the Employee's employment at any time for Cause (as hereinafter
defined). Upon termination for Cause, the Employee shall receive his Base Salary
only through the date that such termination becomes effective. Neither the
Employee nor any other person shall be entitled to any further payments from the
Company, for salary or any other amounts except for any amounts owing under the
Merger Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any rights and benefits the
Employee may have under employee benefit plans and programs of the Company or
FNB following a termination of the Employee's employment for Cause shall be
determined in accordance with the terms of such plans, agreements and programs.
For purposes of this Agreement, termination for Cause shall mean termination by
the Company of the Employee's employment as a result of (i) an intentional,
willful and continued failure by the Employee to perform his duties in the
capacities indicated above (other than due to disability); (ii) an intentional,
willful and material breach by the Employee of his fiduciary duties of loyalty
and care to the Company; (iii) an intentional, willful and knowing violation by
the Employee of any provision of this Agreement; (iv) a conviction of, or the
entering of a plea of nolo contendere by the Employee for any felony or any
crime involving fraud or dishonesty, or (v) a willful and knowing violation of
any material federal or state law or regulation applicable to the Company or


                                       -3-

<PAGE>

the occurrence of any act or event as a result of which the Employee becomes
unacceptable to, or is removed, suspended or prohibited from participating in
the conduct of the Company's affairs by any regulatory authority having
jurisdiction over the Company or FNB.

        (d) Termination Other Than For Cause. The Company may terminate the
Employee's employment under this Agreement at any time upon 90 days written
notice to the Employee for whatever reason it deems appropriate, or for no
reason. In the event such termination by the Company occurs and is not due to
death as provided in Section 5(a) above or for Cause as provided in Section 5(c)
above, the Company shall continue the Employee's Base Salary, at the rate in
effect at the time of such termination through the end of the then current term
of this Agreement. Such salary continuation shall be subject to all applicable
federal and state withholding taxes. Any rights and benefits the Employee may
have under employee benefit plans and programs of the Company or FNB following a
termination of the Employee's employment other than for Cause shall be
determined in accordance with the terms of such plans, agreements and programs.
In addition to and notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a termination
pursuant to this Section 5(d), the Company shall continue to provide to the
Employee either the benefits to which the Employee is entitled under this
Agreement or the economic equivalent thereof for the remainder of the term of
this Agreement.

        (e) At the Employee's Option. The Employee may terminate his employment
at any time upon at least 60 days advance written notice to the Company;
provided, however, that the Company, in its discretion, may cause such
termination to be effective at any time during such notice period. In the event
of such a voluntary termination of employment, the Employee will be entitled to
receive only any earned but unpaid Base Salary and the other benefits of this
Agreement through the date on which the Employee's termination becomes
effective. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any rights and benefits the Employee
may have under employee benefit plans and programs of the Company or FNB
following a voluntary termination of the Employee's employment shall be
determined in accordance with the terms of such plans, agreements and programs.

     6. No Solicitation of Change in Control. The Employee will not solicit,
counsel or encourage any acquisition, merger or other change in control of FNB
or the Company without the prior written approval of the Board of Directors of
the Company or FNB. A violation of this Section 6 shall be deemed to constitute
a forfeiture by the Employee of all of his rights under Section 5(d) hereof.

     7. Noncompetition Covenant; Nonsolicitation. For purposes of this Section 7
and the following Sections 8 through 12, "Company" shall mean the Company, FNB
and/or any of its subsidiaries.

        (a) In consideration of this Agreement and the acquisition by FNB of the
Employee's shares of capital stock of the Company pursuant to the Merger
Agreement, for a period commencing on the date hereof and continuing until the
later of (X) the fifth anniversary of the date of this Agreement and (Y) one
year after (i) the date of expiration of the term hereof (as such term may be
extended by the mutual agreement in writing of the parties) or the date that any
termination of the Employee's employment under this Agreement becomes effective
or (ii) the last day of the period after the date that any termination of the
Employee's employment




                                       -4-

<PAGE>

under this Agreement becomes effective in which the Employee is entitled to
receive any Base Salary pursuant to Section 5 hereof, whichever is later, the
Employee will not, directly or indirectly:

             (i) own any interest in, manage, operate, control, be employed by,
        render consulting or advisory services to, or participate in or be
        connected with the management or control of any business that is then
        engaged or proposes to engage in the operation of mortgage lending,
        mortgage brokering or mortgage banking activities, or such other
        activities as the Employee may be engaged in the course of his
        employment with the Company, and that conducts any of its operations
        within North Carolina or South Carolina; provided, however, that the
        Employee may, without violating this Agreement, own as a passive
        investment not in excess of three percent (3%) of the outstanding
        capital stock of any such business whose stock is publicly traded or
        quoted on the NASDAQ over-the-counter market, the New York Stock
        Exchange, the American Stock Exchange, the National Daily Quotation
        System "Pink Sheets" or the OTC Bulletin Board;


             (ii) influence or attempt to influence any customer of the Company
        to discontinue its use of the Company's services or to divert such
        business to any other person, firm or corporation;

             (iii) interfere with, disrupt or attempt to disrupt the
        relationship, contractual or otherwise, between the Company and any of
        its respective customers, suppliers, principals, distributors, lessors
        or licensors; and

             (iv) solicit any officer or employee of the Company, whose base
        annual salary at the time of the Employee's termination was $25,000 or
        more, to work for any other person, firm or corporation.

        (b) The Employee and the Company intend that Section 7 of this Agreement
be enforced as written. However, if one or more of the provisions contained in
Section 7 shall for any reason be held to be unenforceable because of the
duration or scope of such provision or the area covered thereby, the Employee
and the Company agree that the court making such determination shall have the
power to reform the duration, scope and/or area of such provision and in its
reformed form such provision shall then be enforceable and shall be binding on
the parties.

     8. Confidentiality. The Employee hereby acknowledges and agrees that (i) in
the course of his service as an employee of the Company, he will gain
substantial knowledge of and familiarity with the Company's customers and its
dealings with them, and other information concerning the business of the
Company, all of which constitute valuable assets and privileged information that
is particularly sensitive due to the fiduciary responsibilities inherent in the
banking business; and (ii) to protect the interest in and to assure the benefit
of the business of the Company, it is reasonable and necessary to place certain
restrictions on the Employee's ability to disclose information about the
business and customers of the Company. For that purpose, and in consideration of
the agreements contained herein, the Employee covenants and agrees that any and
all data, figures, projections, estimates, lists, files, records, documents,
manuals or other such


                                       -5-

<PAGE>

materials or information (financial or otherwise) relating to the Company and
its business, regulatory examinations, financial results and condition, lending
and deposit operations, customers (including lists of the customers and
information regarding their accounts and business dealings with the Company),
policies and procedures, computer systems and software, shareholders, employees,
officers and directors (herein referred to as "Confidential Information") are
proprietary to the Company and are valuable, special and unique assets of the
business to which the Employee will have access during his employment hereunder.
The Employee shall consider, treat and maintain all Confidential Information as
the confidential, private and privileged records and information of the Company.
Further, at all times during the term of his employment and following the
termination of his employment under this Agreement for any reason, and except as
shall be required by law or court order (after notice to the Company) or in the
course of the performance by the Employee of his duties on behalf of the Company
or otherwise pursuant to the direct, written authorization of the Company, the
Employee will not divulge any Confidential Information to any other person,
firm, corporation, bank, savings and loan association or similar financial
institution, remove any such Confidential Information in written or other
recorded form from the Company's premises, or make any use of the Confidential
Information for his own purposes or for the benefit of any person, firm,
corporation, bank, savings and loan association or similar financial institution
other than the Company. However, following the termination of the Employee's
employment with the Company, this Section 8 shall not apply to any Confidential
Information which then is in the public domain (provided that the Employee was
not responsible, directly or indirectly, for permitting such Confidential
Information to enter the public domain without the Company's consent), or which
is obtained by the Employee from a third party which or who is not obligated
under an agreement of confidentiality with respect to such information.

     9. Remedies Upon Breach. Each party agrees that any breach of this
Agreement by either party could cause irreparable damage to the other party and
that in the event of such breach the other party shall have, in addition to any
and all remedies of law, the right to an injunction, specific performance or
other equitable relief to prevent the violation of the obligations of the
breaching party hereunder, without the necessity of posting a bond, plus the
recovery of any and all costs and expenses incurred by the enforcing party,
including reasonable attorneys' fees in connection with the enforcement of this
Agreement, provided that the enforcing party shall have been successful on the
merits or otherwise in any proceeding related to the enforcement thereof.

     10. Acknowledgments. The Employee hereby acknowledges that the enforcement
of Sections 7 and 8 of this Agreement is necessary to ensure the preservation,
protection and continuity of the business, trade secrets and goodwill of the
Company, and that the restrictions set forth in Sections 7 and 8 of this
Agreement are reasonable as to time, scope and territory and in all other
respects.

     11. Tolling Period. In the event the Employee breaches any of the
provisions contained herein and the Company seeks compliance with such
provisions by judicial proceedings, the time period during which the Employee is
restricted by such provisions shall be extended by the time during which the
Employee has actually competed with the Company or been in violation of any such
provision and any period of litigation required to enforce the Employee's
obligations under this Agreement.


                                       -6-

     12. Severability. In case any one or more of the provisions contained in
this Agreement for any reason shall be held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability
shall not affect any other provision of this Agreement but this Agreement shall
be construed as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions had never
been contained herein.

     13. Consent and Waiver by Third Parties. The Employee hereby represents and
warrants that his employment with the Company on the terms and conditions set
forth herein and his execution and performance of this Agreement do not
constitute a breach or violation of any other agreement, obligation or
understanding with any third party. The Employee represents that he is not bound
by any agreement or any other existing or previous business relationship which
conflicts with, or may conflict with, the performance of his obligations
hereunder or prevents the full performance of his duties and obligations
hereunder.

     14. Waivers and Modifications. This Agreement may be modified, and the
rights and remedies of any provision hereof may be waived, only in accordance
with this Section 14. No waiver by either party of any breach by the other or
any provision hereof shall be deemed to be a waiver of any later or other breach
thereof or as a waiver of any other provision of this Agreement. This Agreement
sets forth all of the terms of the understandings between the parties with
reference to the subject matter set forth herein and may not be waived, changed,
discharged or terminated orally or by any course of dealing between the parties,
but only by an instrument in writing signed by the party against whom any
waiver, change, discharge or termination is sought.

     15. Assignment. The Employee acknowledges that the services to be rendered
by him are unique and personal. Accordingly, the Employee may not assign any of
his rights or delegate any of his duties or obligations under this Agreement.
The Company shall have the right to assign this Agreement to FNB or any of its
subsidiaries or to its successors under law, and the rights and obligations of
the Company under this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of, and shall be
binding upon, the successors and permitted assigns of the Company.

     16. Notices. All notices hereunder shall be (i) delivered by hand, (ii)

                              - - - - - - - - - -

     WHEREAS, the Company desires to employ the Employee, the Employee desires
to accept employment with the Company, and each desires to enter into an
agreement embodying the terms of such employment;

     NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, and in consideration of the mutual
covenants and obligations herein contained, the parties hereto agree as follows:

     1. Employment. The Company hereby employs the Employee, and the Employee

below, in the position and with the duties and responsibilities set forth in
Section 3 below, and upon the other terms and conditions hereinafter stated.

     2. Term. The term of this Agreement shall commence as of the date hereof

     3. Position and Responsibilities. The Employee shall serve as the Chief
Financial Officer of the Company, or in such other appropriate position and with
such duties as the Company or its parent, FNB Corp. ("FNB"), may in the future
designate. In such capacity, the Employee shall at all times report to, and his
activities shall at all times be subject to the direction and control of, the
Board of Directors and the President of the Company. The Employee shall devote
substantially all of his business time, attention and services to discharge
faithfully and diligently his duties and responsibilities under this Agreement
and to use his best efforts for both the successful operation of the Company's
business and the successful implementation of the policies established by the
Company or FNB. The Employee shall not be required to relocate more than 35

     4. Compensation and Benefits. During the term of this Agreement, the
Company shall provide to the Employee the following compensation and benefits:

        (a) Salary. In consideration of the services to be rendered by the
Employee to the Company and the Employee's covenants hereunder, the Company
shall pay to the Employee a base salary at the rate of $70,000 per annum (such
salary as it may be increased from time to time being hereinafter referred to as

of Employee's performance at least as frequently as annually, and Employee may

<PAGE>

Company's policies and practices for employee compensation as established or
modified from time to time. Except as may otherwise be agreed, the Base Salary
shall be payable in accordance with the Company's policies and practices for
employee compensation as established or modified from time to time; provided
that the Base Salary shall be payable not less frequently than monthly. Salary
payments shall be subject to all applicable federal and state withholding,
payroll and other taxes.

        (b) Group Benefit Plans and Programs. The Employee will be entitled to
participate, in accordance with the provisions thereof, in any group health,
disability and life insurance, and any pension, retirement and other employee
benefit plans and programs made available by the Company or FNB to their
employees generally.

        (c) Vacation. The Employee shall be entitled to such vacation and other
leave as may be provided by the Company or FNB to their employees in similar
positions generally; provided, however, that, to the extent that the amount of
vacation and other leave to which the Employee is entitled is related to the
Employee's years of service to the Company or FNB, the Employee shall be given
credit for each year of service as an employee of the Company.

        (d) Business Expenses. The Company shall reimburse the Employee for any
reasonable continuing education (CPE) and out-of-pocket business and travel
expenses incurred by the Employee in the ordinary course of performing his
duties for the Company upon presentation by the Employee, from time to time, of
appropriate documentation therefor and in accordance with the Company's policies
and practices as established or modified from time to time.

        (e) Bonus. The Employee shall be entitled to receive a bonus each year
calculated as a percentage of the Company's Pre-Tax Net Income (as defined in
Exhibit A attached hereto and made a part hereof) for the immediately preceding
calendar year (but excluding Pre-Tax Net Income attributable to any periods
prior to the date hereof). Such bonus shall be equal to 3.0% of the Company's
Pre-Tax Net Income up to $1,800,000 and 1.5% of the Company's Pre-Tax Net Income
in excess of $1,800,000 but less than or equal to $2,500,000 in a year. The
Employee shall not be entitled to a bonus with respect to Pre-Tax Net Income in
excess of $2,500,000. The bonus shall be payable within 31 days of calendar
year-end. This Section 4(e) shall not preclude the Employee from being eligible
to receive such other bonuses as the Board of Directors of the Company in its
sole discretion may approve.

     5. Termination. The Employee's term of employment under this Agreement may
be terminated before the end of the initial term or any extension thereof as
follows:

        (a) Death. In the event of the death of the Employee during his
employment under this Agreement, this Agreement shall be terminated as of the
date of death. In such event, the Company shall pay the Employee's Base Salary,
at the rate in effect at the time of his death and through the last day of the
calendar month in which such death occurs, to the Employee's designated
beneficiary, or, in the absence of such designation, to the estate or other
legal representative of the Employee. Any rights and benefits the Employee's
estate or any other person may have under employee benefit plans and programs of
the Company or FNB in the

                                       2


<PAGE>

event of the Employee's death shall be determined in accordance with the terms
of such plans and programs.

        (b) Long-Term Disability. If the Employee suffers any disability while
employed under this Agreement that prevents him from performing his duties under
this Agreement for a period of 90 consecutive days, then, unless otherwise then
agreed in writing by the parties hereto, the employment of the Employee under
this Agreement shall, at the election of the Company, be terminated effective as
of the ninetieth day of such period. Upon termination of the Employee's
employment by reason of disability under this Section 5(b), the Employee shall
be entitled to receive his Base Salary, at the rate in effect on the date of
such termination, less any disability insurance payments paid to the Employee on
a policy maintained for the benefit of the Employee by the Company or FNB,
through the end of the then current term of this Agreement. Any rights and
benefits the Employee may have under employee benefit plans and programs of the
Company or FNB in the event of the Employee's disability shall be determined in
accordance with the terms of such plans and programs.

        For purposes of this Agreement, "disability" shall mean the inability,
by reason of bodily injury or physical or mental disease, or any combination
thereof, of the Employee to perform his customary or other comparable duties
with the Company. In the event that the Employee and the Company are unable to
agree as to whether the Employee is suffering a disability, the Employee and the
Company shall each select a physician and the two physicians so chosen shall
make the determination or, if they are unable to agree, they shall select a
third physician, and the determination as to whether the Employee is suffering a
disability shall be based upon the determination of a majority of the three
physicians. The Company shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of all
physicians selected pursuant to this Section 5(b).

        (c) Termination for Cause. Nothing herein shall prevent the Company from
terminating the Employee's employment at any time for Cause (as hereinafter
defined). Upon termination for Cause, the Employee shall receive his Base Salary
only through the date that such termination becomes effective. Neither the
Employee nor any other person shall be entitled to any further payments from the
Company, for salary or any other amounts. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any
rights and benefits the Employee may have under employee benefit plans and
programs of the Company or FNB following a termination of the Employee's
employment for Cause shall be determined in accordance with the terms of such
plans, agreements and programs. For purposes of this Agreement, termination for
Cause shall mean termination by the Company of the Employee's employment as a
result of (i) an intentional, willful and continued failure by the Employee to
perform his duties in the capacities indicated above (other than due to
disability); (ii) an intentional, willful and material breach by the Employee of
his fiduciary duties of loyalty and care to the Company; (iii) an intentional,
willful and knowing violation by the Employee of any provision of this
Agreement; (iv) a conviction of, or the entering of a plea of nolo contendere by
the Employee for any felony or any crime involving fraud or dishonesty, or (v) a
willful and knowing violation of any material federal or state law or regulation
applicable to the Company or the occurrence of any act or event as a result of
which the Employee becomes unacceptable to, or is removed, suspended or
prohibited from participating in the conduct of the Company's affairs by any
regulatory authority having jurisdiction over the Company or FNB.

        (d) Termination Other Than For Cause. The Company may terminate the
Employee's employment under this Agreement at any time upon 90 days written
notice to the Employee for whatever reason it deems appropriate, or for no
reason. In the event such termination by the Company occurs and is not due to
death as provided in Section 5(a) above or for Cause as provided in Section 5(c)
above, the Company shall continue the Employee's Base Salary, at the rate in
effect at the time of such termination through the end of the then current term
of this Agreement. Such salary continuation shall be subject to all applicable
federal and state withholding taxes. Any rights and benefits the Employee may
have under employee benefit plans and programs of the Company or FNB following a
termination of the Employee's employment other than for Cause shall be
determined in accordance with the terms of such plans, agreements and programs.

        (e) At the Employee's Option. The Employee may terminate his employment
at any time upon at least 60 days advance written notice to the Company;
provided, however, that the Company, in its discretion, may cause such
termination to be effective at any time during such notice period. In the event
of such a voluntary termination of employment, the Employee will be entitled to
receive only any earned but unpaid Base Salary and the other benefits of this
Agreement through the date on which the Employee's termination becomes
effective. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any rights and benefits the Employee
may have under employee benefit plans and programs of the Company or FNB
following a voluntary termination of the Employee's employment shall be
determined in accordance with the terms of such plans, agreements and programs.

     6. No Solicitation of Change in Control. The Employee will not solicit,
counsel or encourage any acquisition, merger or other change in control of FNB
or the Company without the prior written approval of the Board of Directors of
the Company or FNB. A violation of this Section 6 shall be deemed to constitute
a forfeiture by the Employee of all of his rights under Section 5(d) hereof.

     7. Noncompetition Covenant; Nonsolicitation. For purposes of this Section 7
and the following Sections 8 through 12, "Company" shall mean the Company, FNB
and/or any of its subsidiaries.

        (a) For a period commencing on the date hereof and continuing until (i)
one year after the date of expiration of the term hereof (as such term may be
extended by the mutual agreement in writing of the parties) or the date that any
termination of the Employee's employment under this Agreement becomes effective
or (ii) the last day of the period after the date that any termination of the
Employee's employment under this Agreement becomes effective in which the
Employee is entitled to receive any Base Salary pursuant to Section 5 hereof,
whichever is later, the Employee will not, directly or indirectly:

            (i) own any interest in, manage, operate, control, be employed by,
         render consulting or advisory services to, or participate in or be
         connected with the management or control of any business that is then
         engaged or proposes to engage in the operation of mortgage lending,
         mortgage brokering or mortgage banking activities, or such other
         activities as the Employee may be engaged in the course of his
         employment with the Company, and that conducts any of its

                                       4


<PAGE>

        operations within North Carolina or South Carolina; provided, however,
        that the Employee may, without violating this Agreement, own as a
        passive investment not in excess of three percent (3%) of the
        outstanding capital stock of any such business whose stock is publicly
        traded or quoted on the NASDAQ over-the-counter market, the New York
        Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange, the National Daily
        Quotation System "Pink Sheets" or the OTC Bulletin Board;

           (ii) influence or attempt to influence any customer of the Company
        to discontinue its use of the Company's services or to divert such
        business to any other person, firm or corporation;

           (iii) interfere with, disrupt or attempt to disrupt the
        relationship, contractual or otherwise, between the Company and any of
        its respective customers, suppliers, principals, distributors, lessors
        or licensors; and

           (iv) solicit any officer or employee of the Company, whose base
        annual salary at the time of the Employee's termination was $25,000 or
        more, to work for any other person, firm or corporation.

        (b) It is expressly agreed that the provisions and covenants in this
Section 7 shall not apply and shall be of no force or effect in the event that
the Company fails to honor its obligations hereunder.

        (c) The Employee and the Company intend that Section 7 of this
Agreement be enforced as written. However, if one or more of the provisions
contained in Section 7 shall for any reason be held to be unenforceable because
of the duration or scope of such provision or the area covered thereby, the
Employee and the Company agree that the court making such determination shall
have the power to reform the duration, scope and/or area of such provision and
in its reformed form such provision shall then be enforceable and shall be
binding on the parties.

     8. Confidentiality. The Employee hereby acknowledges and agrees that (i) in
the course of his service as an employee of the Company, he will gain
substantial knowledge of and familiarity with the Company's customers and its
dealings with them, and other information concerning the business of the
Company, all of which constitute valuable assets and privileged information that
is particularly sensitive due to the fiduciary responsibilities inherent in the
Companying business; and (ii) to protect the interest in and to assure the
benefit of the business of the Company, it is reasonable and necessary to place
certain restrictions on the Employee's ability to disclose information about the
business and customers of the Company. For that purpose, and in consideration of
the agreements contained herein, the Employee covenants and agrees that any and
all data, figures, projections, estimates, lists, files, records, documents,
manuals or other such materials or information (financial or otherwise) relating
to the Company and its business, regulatory examinations, financial results and
condition, lending and deposit operations, customers (including lists of the
customers and information regarding their accounts and business dealings with
the Company), policies and procedures, computer systems and software,
shareholders, employees, officers and directors (herein referred to as
"Confidential Information") are proprietary to the Company and are valuable,
special and unique assets of the

                                       5


<PAGE>

business to which the Employee will have access during his employment hereunder.
The Employee shall consider, treat and maintain all Confidential Information as
the confidential, private and privileged records and information of the Company.
Further, at all times during the term of his employment and following the
termination of his employment under this Agreement for any reason, and except as
shall be required by law or court order (after notice to the Company) or in the
course of the performance by the Employee of his duties on behalf of the Company
or otherwise pursuant to the direct, written authorization of the Company, the
Employee will not divulge any Confidential Information to any other person,
firm, corporation, Company, savings and loan association or similar financial
institution, remove any such Confidential Information in written or other
recorded form from the Company's premises, or make any use of the Confidential
Information for his own purposes or for the benefit of any person, firm,
corporation, Company, savings and loan association or similar financial
institution other than the Company. However, following the termination of the
Employee's employment with the Company, this Section 8 shall not apply to any
Confidential Information which then is in the public domain (provided that the
Employee was not responsible, directly or indirectly, for permitting such
Confidential Information to enter the public domain without the Company's
consent), or which is obtained by the Employee from a third party which or who
is not obligated under an agreement of confidentiality with respect to such
information.

     9. Remedies Upon Breach. Each party agrees that any breach of this
Agreement by either party could cause irreparable damage to the other party and
that in the event of such breach the other party shall have, in addition to any
and all remedies of law, the right to an injunction, specific performance or
other equitable relief to prevent the violation of the obligations of the
breaching party hereunder, without the necessity of posting a bond, plus the
recovery of any and all costs and expenses incurred by the enforcing party,
including reasonable attorneys' fees in connection with the enforcement of this
Agreement, provided that the enforcing party shall have been successful on the
merits or otherwise in any proceeding related to the enforcement thereof.

     10. Acknowledgments. The Employee hereby acknowledges that the enforcement
of Sections 7 and 8 of this Agreement is necessary to ensure the preservation,
protection and continuity of the business, trade secrets and goodwill of the
Company, and that the restrictions set forth in Sections 7 and 8 of this
Agreement are reasonable as to time, scope and territory and in all other
respects.

     11. Tolling Period. In the event the Employee breaches any of the
provisions contained herein and the Company seeks compliance with such
provisions by judicial proceedings, the time period during which the Employee is
restricted by such provisions shall be extended by the time during which the
Employee has actually competed with the Company or been in violation of any such
provision and any period of litigation required to enforce the Employee's
obligations under this Agreement.

     12. Severability. In case any one or more of the provisions contained in
this Agreement for any reason shall be held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability
shall not affect any other provision of this Agreement but this Agreement shall
be construed as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions had never
been contained herein.

     13. Consent and Waiver by Third Parties. The Employee hereby represents and
warrants that his employment with the Company on the terms and conditions set
forth herein and his execution and performance of this Agreement do not
constitute a breach or violation of any other agreement, obligation or
understanding with any third party. The Employee represents that he is not bound
by any agreement or any other existing or previous business relationship which
conflicts with, or may conflict with, the performance of his obligations
hereunder or prevents the full performance of his duties and obligations
hereunder.

     14. Waivers and Modifications. This Agreement may be modified, and the
rights and remedies of any provision hereof may be waived, only in accordance
with this Section 14. No waiver by either party of any breach by the other or
any provision hereof shall be deemed to be a waiver of any later or other breach
thereof or as a waiver of any other provision of this Agreement. This Agreement
sets forth all of the terms of the understandings between the parties with
reference to the subject matter set forth herein and may not be waived, changed,
discharged or terminated orally or by any course of dealing between the parties,
but only by an instrument in writing signed by the party against whom any
waiver, change, discharge or termination is sought.

     15. Assignment. The Employee acknowledges that the services to be rendered
by him are unique and personal. Accordingly, the Employee may not assign any of
his rights or delegate any of his duties or obligations under this Agreement.
The Company shall have the right to assign this Agreement to FNB or any of its
subsidiaries or to its successors under law, and the rights and obligations of
the Company under this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of, and shall be
binding upon, the successors and permitted assigns of the Company.

                              Employment Agreement

     "Pre-Tax Net Income" for any period means the Company's aggregate earnings
net of losses from operations, calculated as though the Company operated as a
separate and independent corporation, after deduction of all appropriate
expenses, charges and reserves, but before adjustment for federal and state
income taxes. Pre-Tax Net Income shall be determined in accordance with
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (as defined below) consistently applied
as determined by FNB or the firm of independent certified public accountants
engaged by FNB for purposes of its own audit. In determining such Pre-Tax Net
Income:

     (i)   Pre-Tax Net Income shall be computed without regard to "extraordinary
           items" of gain or loss as that term shall be defined by Generally
           Accepted Accounting Principles;

     (ii)  Pre-Tax Net Income shall not include any gains, profits or losses
           realized from the sale of any assets other than in the ordinary
           course of business;

     (iii) Pre-Tax Net Income shall include a deduction for (x) the allocation
           of reasonable and appropriately documented direct overhead expenses,
           (y) payment of salaries and bonuses for officers and employees of the
           Company, excluding any accruals for the retention bonuses
           contemplated by Section 7.14 of the Merger Agreement dated as of
           February 20, 2003 among FNB, the Company and the shareholders of the
           Company (the "Merger Agreement"), the bonus to the Employee provided
           for in this Agreement, and the bonus payable to J. Edward Joye, Jr.
           pursuant to Section 4(e) of the Employment Agreement dated as of
           ____________, 2003 between the Company and J. Edward Joye, Jr., and
           (z) interest charged in any loans or advances made by FNB or any of
           its Affiliates to the Company in connection with its business
           operations; provided that such interest charges shall not exceed
           those that FNB or its Affiliates would charge to similarly situated
           third party's in arm's-length transactions, and provided further that
           the Company shall not be obligated to satisfy its borrowing needs
           from FNB or any of its Affiliates but may borrow from third-party
           lenders; and

     (iv)  Pre-Tax Net Income shall not include any income or expenses related
           to the acquisition, disposition or operation of any other mortgage
           brokerage, mortgage banking or lending business subsequent to the
           closing of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement but
           shall include any income or expenses related to the expansion of the
           Company's business through the opening and operation by the Company
           of any de novo loan origination offices.
