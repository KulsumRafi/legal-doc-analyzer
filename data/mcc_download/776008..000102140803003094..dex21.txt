       1.6   Net Working Capital Adjustment.

             (a)  As promptly as practicable, but no later than sixty (60) days
after the Closing Date, Parent shall prepare (or cause to be prepared) and
deliver to Purchaser for review, a closing statement (the "Closing Statement"),
setting forth Parent's calculation of the Net Working Capital of the Transferred
Business as of the close of business of the Closing Date. The "Net Working
Capital of the Transferred Business" shall mean the Assets that are current
assets less the Assumed Liabilities that are current liabilities.

             (b)  Purchaser shall cause the employees of the Business to assist
Parent and its accountants in the preparation of the Closing Statement and shall
provide Parent and its auditors reasonable access, during normal business hours
and upon reasonable prior notice, to the personnel, properties, books and
records of the Business for such purpose.

             (c)  During the twenty (20)-day period following Purchaser's
receipt of the Closing Statement, Purchaser and its auditors shall be permitted
to review the working papers relating to the Closing Statement (provided that
Purchaser and its accountants execute and deliver a confidentiality agreement,
reasonably satisfactory to the Sellers, and adhere to whatever procedures the
Sellers reasonably request to safeguard confidential, non-public or privileged
information relating to the Sellers or any of their respective subsidiaries),
and the Sellers shall cooperate with Purchaser and its auditors to provide them
with any other information used in preparing the Closing Statement reasonably
requested by Purchaser or its auditors. The Closing Statement shall become final
and binding upon the parties on the 20th day following delivery

                                        8

<PAGE>

thereof, unless Purchaser delivers to Parent written notice of its disagreement
("Notice of Disagreement") specifying in reasonable detail the amount by which
and the reasons why it believes the Closing Statement (i) contains mathematical
errors or (ii) was not prepared in accordance with the methodology specified in
Section 1.6(g). The Notice of Disagreement shall not specify any basis for
disagreement with the Closing Statement other than as set forth in the preceding
sentence.

             (d)  If a timely and otherwise sufficient Notice of Disagreement
shall be delivered to Parent in accordance with Section 1.6(c), Purchaser and
Parent shall, during the twenty (20) days following such delivery, seek in good
faith to resolve in writing any differences which they may have with respect to
the matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement. If during such twenty
(20)-day period Purchaser and Parent agree in writing on the correct
determination of the Closing Statement, such determination shall be final and
binding on the parties for all purposes hereunder. If Purchaser and Parent have
not resolved such differences by the end of such twenty (20)-day period,
Purchaser and Parent shall promptly submit, in writing, to an independent public
accounting firm (the "Accounting Firm") their briefs detailing their views as to
the correct amount of Net Working Capital of the Transferred Business as of the
Closing Date, and the Accounting Firm shall determine the final amount of Net
Working Capital of the Transferred Business as of the Closing Date, which
determination shall be final and binding on the parties for all purposes
hereunder. The Accounting Firm shall be the Washington, DC regional office of
Ernst & Young LLP or, if such firm is unable or unwilling to act, Deloitte &
Touche LLP or KPMG LLP or, if such firms are unable or unwilling to act, such
other independent public accounting firm as shall be agreed upon by the parties
hereto in writing. Purchaser and Parent shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the Accounting Firm to issue a report setting forth its
calculation of the Closing Statement, as promptly as practicable, but in any
event within thirty (30) days following the submission of the matters. The fees
and expenses of the Accounting Firm pursuant to this Section 1.6(d) shall be
borne equally by Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Sellers, on the other hand.
The fees and disbursements of the auditors and other advisors of each party
hereto incurred in connection with their review of the Closing Statement and
review of any Notice of Disagreement shall be borne by such party.

             (e)  If the Final Net Working Capital of the Transferred Business
is less than $5.0 million by more than $50,000, the Purchase Price shall be
decreased by the amount by which $5.0 million exceeds the Final Net Working
Capital of the Transferred Business. If the Final Net Working Capital of the
Transferred Business is greater than $5.0 million by more than $50,000, the
Purchase Price shall be increased by the amount by which the Final Net Working
Capital of the Transferred Business exceeds $5.0 million. The "Final Net Working
Capital of the Transferred Business" means the Net Working Capital of the
Transferred Business as (i) shown on the Closing Statement pursuant to Section
1.6(a) if no timely and otherwise sufficient Notice of Disagreement is delivered
to Parent in accordance with Section 1.6(c) or (ii) if a timely and otherwise
sufficient Notice of Disagreement is delivered to Parent in accordance with
Section 1.6(c), as determined pursuant to Section 1.6(d).

             (f)  Within three (3) Business Days after the Final Net Working
Capital has been determined pursuant to this Section 1.6, the Sellers shall pay
to Purchaser the amount of any decrease in the Purchase Price or Purchaser shall
pay to the Sellers the amount of any increase in the Purchase Price, as the case
may be, together in either case with an amount equal to interest thereon at the
rate of 10.0% per annum from the Closing Date to and including the

                                        9

<PAGE>

date of payment, by intra-bank transfer or wire transfer of immediately
available funds to any account designated in writing by the party or parties
entitled to such payment.

             (g)  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
for the purposes of this Section 1.6, Net Working Capital of the Transferred
Business shall be determined in accordance with GAAP (except to the extent the
Interim Balance Sheet was not prepared in accordance with GAAP, as reflected in
Schedule 2.19), applied on a basis consistent with the application of GAAP in
the preparation of the Interim Balance Sheet, and except as otherwise specified
in Schedule 1.6.

             (h)  In determining the correct calculation of accounts receivable
to be included in the Net Working Capital of the Transferred Business, the
Sellers' determination of the amount of the reserve for uncollected accounts
shall be final and binding. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, any matter which, but for the $50,000 threshold, would have been the
subject of such an adjustment to the Net Working Capital of the Transferred
Business pursuant to this Section 1.6 may not be asserted by Purchaser or any
Purchaser Indemnified Party as an alleged misrepresentation or breach of any
warranty or covenant in this Agreement.

       1.7   Accounts Receivable.

             (a)  From and after the Closing, Purchaser shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to collect on a timely basis all accounts receivable
reflected in the Net Working Capital of the Transferred Business on the Closing
Statement (the "Closing Accounts Receivable"). The Sellers shall have the right
to cooperate with and assist Purchaser in such collection efforts. Within five
(5) Business Days after the end of each calendar week, Purchaser shall furnish
the Sellers with a complete and detailed statement of the amounts collected
during such calendar week and in any prior calendar weeks with respect to the
Closing Accounts Receivable and a complete and detailed schedule of the amount
remaining outstanding under each particular account. As promptly as practicable
after the sixtieth (60/th/) day after the Closing, but in no event more than
sixty-five (65) days after the Closing, Purchaser shall prepare (or cause to be
prepared) and deliver to Parent, a certificate (the "Receivables Certificate")
signed by Purchaser's chief financial officer certifying, as of the date the
Receivables Certificate is delivered to Parent, as to (i) the amount of Closing
Accounts Receivable that Purchaser has collected (the "Collected Closing
Accounts Receivable"), (ii) each Closing Account Receivable not fully collected
by Purchaser or its Affiliates, and (iii) for each Closing Account Receivable
not fully collected by Purchaser or its Affiliates, the amount not collected.

             (b)  Any payment received by Purchaser (i) at any time following
the Closing and (ii) from a customer of Purchaser after the Closing that was
also a customer of the Sellers prior to the Closing and that is obligated with
respect to any Closing Accounts Receivable, shall be presumptively applied to
the accounts receivable for such customer outstanding for the longest amount of
time and, if such accounts receivable shall be a Closing Accounts Receivable,
reflected in the Receivables Certificate in accordance with Section 1.7(a).

             (c)  If Purchaser timely delivers to Parent a Receivables
Certificate in accordance with Section 1.7(a), and that Receivables Certificate
states that the aggregate amount of Collected Closing Accounts Receivable equals
less than the amount of accounts receivable (net of reserves) reflected in the
calculation of Final Net Working Capital of the Transferred

                                       10

<PAGE>

Business (the "Minimum Receivables Amount"), then, for 20 days after such
delivery of such Receivables Certificate, Purchaser shall provide Parent with
reasonable access, during normal business hours and upon reasonable prior
notice, to Purchaser's customers, personnel, properties, books and records
related to the Business for the purpose of confirming the accuracy of the
Receivables Certificate.

          (d) Purchaser and Parent shall cooperate in good faith to resolve any
disputes with respect to the Receivables Certificate, including the amount of
the Collected Closing Accounts Receivables.

          (e) If Purchaser timely delivers to Parent a Receivables Certificate
in accordance with Section 1.7(a), and that Receivables Certificate states that
the aggregate amount of Collected Closing Accounts Receivable equals less than
the Minimum Receivable Amount, on the later of (x) five (5) Business Days after
delivery to Parent of such Receivables Certificate and (y) the date on which the
Final Net Working Capital of the Transferred Business has been finally
determined pursuant to Section 1.6, (i) Parent shall pay to Purchaser the amount
by which the Minimum Receivables Amount exceeds the Collected Closing Accounts
Receivable, (ii) Purchaser shall transfer to Parent all rights to collect the
Closing Accounts Receivable that are not Collected Closing Accounts Receivable,
and (iii) Purchaser shall cooperate in good faith with Parent's efforts to
collect such receivables, including, without limitation, promptly forwarding to
Parent any amounts received in respect of Closing Accounts Receivable that are
not Collected Closing Accounts Receivable.

     1.8  Allocation of Purchase Price. Purchaser shall, within 120 days after
the final agreement or determination of the Purchase Price, prepare and deliver
to Parent a schedule (the "Allocation Schedule") allocating the Purchase Price
and the Assumed Liabilities among the Assets in accordance with Treas. Reg.
1.1060-1 (or any comparable provisions of state or local tax law) or any
successor provision. Parent will have the right to raise reasonable objections
to the Allocation Schedule within 10 days after its receipt thereof, in which
event Parent and Purchaser will negotiate in good faith to resolve such
objections. If Parent and Purchaser cannot mutually resolve Parent's reasonable
objections to the Allocation Schedule within 10 days after Purchaser's receipt
of such objections, such dispute with respect to the Allocation Schedule shall
be presented to the Accounting Firm which Accounting Firm shall, within thirty
(30) days thereafter, render a final and binding decision upon each of the
parties. The fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection therewith shall be
shared in equal amounts by the Sellers, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the
other hand. The Sellers and Purchaser shall each report and file all Tax Returns
(including amended Tax Returns and claims for refunds) consistent with the
Allocation Schedule, and shall take no position contrary thereto or inconsistent
therewith (including, without limitation, in any audits or examinations by any
taxing authority or any other proceedings), provided however, nothing herein
shall prevent either party from compromising in any audit or examination by any
taxing authority the position required to be taken by this Section 1.8 in
respect of the allocation of the Purchase Price. The Sellers and Purchaser shall
cooperate in the filing of any forms (including Form 8594) with respect to such
allocation, including any amendments to such forms required with respect to any
adjustment to the Purchase Price, pursuant to this Agreement. Notwithstanding
any other provisions of this Agreement, this Section 1.8 shall survive the
Closing Date without limitation.

                                   ARTICLE 2.
                  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE SELLERS

                                       11

<PAGE>

          Each of the Sellers represents and warrants to Purchaser, jointly and
severally, that, except as set forth in the Schedules delivered by the Sellers
to Purchaser prior to the execution of this Agreement, as of the date of this
Agreement:

     2.1  Corporate Organization and Authority of the Sellers. Each of the
Sellers is duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing in its
respective jurisdiction of organization. Each Seller has the corporate power and
authority to own or lease its properties and to conduct the Business as it is
now being conducted, and each of the Sellers has the corporate power and
authority to enter into this Agreement and to perform its obligations hereunder.
Parent owns all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Opco. Other than
Opco in the case of Parent, neither Parent nor Opco has any Subsidiaries that
owns Assets or operates the Business. Each of the Sellers is duly licensed or
qualified as a foreign corporation and in good standing to do business in each
jurisdiction in which the property owned, leased, or operated by it or the
character of its activities is such as to require it to be so licensed or
qualified, except where the failure to be so licensed or qualified, individually
or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Business
Material Adverse Effect. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by each of
the Sellers and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby have
been duly and validly authorized and approved by the Board of Directors of each
of the Sellers, and, subject to approval by the affirmative vote or written
consent of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock,
par value $0.0001 per share, of Parent ("Parent Common Stock"), and by Parent as
sole stockholder of Opco, no other corporate approval or proceeding on the part
of either of the Sellers is necessary to authorize this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly and validly
executed and delivered by each of the Sellers and, assuming due authorization,
execution and delivery by Purchaser, constitutes a legally valid and binding
obligation of each of the Sellers, enforceable against each of the Sellers in
accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws affecting
creditors' rights generally and subject, as to enforceability, to general
principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is sought in a
proceeding at law or in equity).

     2.2  No Conflict. Except as set forth in Schedule 2.2, the execution and
delivery of this Agreement by each of the Sellers and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and compliance with the terms hereof does not
and will not (a) conflict with or result in any violation of any provision of,
the certificate of incorporation, bylaws or other organizational documents of
either of the Sellers, (b) violate any order, writ, injunction, decree,
judgment, permit, license, ordinance, law, statute, rule or regulation of any
Governmental Authority applicable to either of the Sellers or the Assets or the
Business, (c) result in a violation or breach of, or constitute a default (with
or without due notice or lapse of time or both), require the consent,
authorization or approval of any other Person, or give rise to any right of
termination, amendment, cancellation, acceleration or loss of material benefit
under, or result in the creation of a Lien (other than any Permitted Liens) on
any of the Assets pursuant to any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any
Transferred Contract, or other Contract, instrument or obligation by which any
of the Assets may be bound, except to the extent that the occurrence of any of
the foregoing in clause (c) would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Business Material Adverse Effect or a material
adverse effect on the ability of the Sellers to enter into and perform their
respective obligations under this Agreement.

     2.3  Assets.

                                       12

<PAGE>

          (a)    Except as set forth in Schedule 2.3, and except for the
Excluded Assets, (i) the Assets include all assets necessary to the conduct of
the Business, as currently conducted, and are sufficient to conduct the Business
immediately following the Closing in substantially the same manner as currently
conducted, and (ii) there are no assets that are material to the Business as
currently conducted other than the Assets. The Assets are in reasonably good
condition and repair (ordinary wear and tear and immaterial defects excluded).

Assets or the Transferred Business, complied in all material respects with the
requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC
promulgated thereunder applicable to such Seller SEC Documents, and none of the
Seller SEC Documents when filed contained any untrue statement of a material
fact or omitted to state a material fact, in either case only in so far as such

of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

     2.21 Sellers Acknowledgement. EACH SELLER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT PURCHASER MAKES
NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES CONCERNING PURCHASER, ITS ASSETS OR ITS
BUSINESS OTHER THAN AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN ARTICLE 3 HEREOF AND THAT
PURCHASER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES,
INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

                                   ARTICLE 3.
                   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PURCHASER

          Purchaser represents and warrants to the Sellers that, as of the date
of this Agreement:

     3.1  Corporate Organization and Authority of Purchaser. Purchaser is duly
incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State
of Delaware. Purchaser has the corporate power and authority to own or lease its
properties and to conduct its business as it is now being conducted, and
Purchaser has the corporate power and authority to enter into this Agreement and
to perform its obligations hereunder. Purchaser is duly licensed or qualified as
a foreign corporation and in good standing to do business in each jurisdiction
in which the ownership of its property or the character of its activities is
such as to require it to be so licensed or qualified, except where the failure
to be so licensed or qualified would not reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on the business, assets, properties, liabilities,
results of operations or financial condition of Purchaser, taken as a whole (a
"Purchaser Material Adverse Effect"). The execution and delivery of this
Agreement by Purchaser and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby have been duly and validly authorized and approved by the Board of
Directors of Purchaser, and no other corporate approval or proceeding on the
part of Purchaser is necessary to authorize this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and
delivered by Purchaser and, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery
by the Sellers, constitutes a legally valid and binding obligation of Purchaser,
enforceable against Purchaser in accordance with its terms, subject to
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization,
moratorium and similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and subject,
as to enforceability, to general principles of equity (regardless of whether
such enforceability is sought in a proceeding at law or in equity).

     3.2  No Conflict. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.2, the execution and
delivery of this Agreement by Purchaser and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby does not and compliance with the terms hereof does not and
will not (a) conflict with or result in any violation of any provision of, the
certificate of incorporation, bylaws or other organizational documents of
Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries, (b) violate any order, writ, injunction,
decree, judgment, permit, license, ordinance, law, statute, rule or regulation
of any Governmental Authority applicable to the assets or business of Purchaser
or any of its Subsidiaries, or (c) result in a violation or breach of, or
constitute a default (with or without due notice or lapse of time or both),
require the consent, authorization or approval of any Person or give rise to any
right of termination, amendment, cancellation, acceleration or loss of material
benefit under, or result in

                                       22

<PAGE>

the creation of a Lien (other than any Permitted Liens) on any of the assets of
Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to any of the terms, conditions or
provisions of any Contract, instrument or other obligation to which Purchaser or
any of its Subsidiaries is bound or by which any of the assets of Purchaser or
any of its Subsidiaries may be bound, except to the extent that the occurrence
of any of the foregoing in clauses (b) or (c) would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect or
a material adverse effect on the ability of Purchaser to enter into and perform
its obligations under this Agreement.

     3.3  SEC Filings. Purchaser has filed all required reports, schedules,
forms, statements and other documents (including exhibits and all other
information incorporated therein) with the SEC since January 1, 2000 (the
"Purchaser SEC Documents"). As of their respective dates, the Purchaser SEC
Documents (including the financial statements filed as a part thereof or
incorporated by reference therein) complied in all material respects with the
requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and
the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder applicable to such
Purchaser SEC Documents, and none of the Purchaser SEC Documents when filed
contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. The financial statements of Purchaser and its subsidiaries included
in the Purchaser SEC Documents comply as to form, as of their respective dates
of filing with the SEC, in all material respects with applicable accounting
requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect
thereto, have been prepared in accordance with GAAP (except, in the case of
unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) applied on a
consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the
notes thereto) and fairly present the consolidated financial position of
Purchaser and its consolidated subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the
consolidated results of their operations and cash flows for the periods then
ended (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal recurring
year-end audit adjustments). Purchaser has no liabilities or obligations which
would be required under GAAP to be reflected on a balance sheet of the Sellers
as of the date of this Agreement, except for liabilities and obligations (i)
reflected or reserved against in the unaudited balance sheet of Purchaser
contained in its Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2002, (ii)
incurred or arising in the ordinary course of business since September 30, 2002,
(iii) incurred or arising other than in the ordinary course of business since
September 30, 2002 and not individually or in the aggregate material, or (iv)
described on Schedule 3.3.

     3.4  Litigation and Proceedings. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.4, there
are no lawsuits, actions, suits, claims, investigations, or other proceedings at
law or in equity, or, to the knowledge of Purchaser, investigations, before or
by any court or Governmental Authority or before any arbitrator pending or, to
the knowledge of Purchaser, threatened, against Purchaser, other than any such
proceeding which would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse
effect on the ability of Purchaser to enter into and perform its obligations
under this Agreement. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.4, there is no
unsatisfied judgment, order or decree requiring payment of monetary damage or
any open injunction binding upon Purchaser that would reasonably be expected to
have a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect or a material adverse effect on the
ability of Purchaser to enter into and perform its obligations under this
Agreement.

                                       23

<PAGE>

     3.5  Legal Compliance. Except with respect to matters set forth on Schedule
3.5, Purchaser is in compliance with all laws, rules, regulations, ordinances,
orders, judgments, writs, injunctions, statutes and decrees thereunder of
Governmental Authorities (and all agencies thereof), except where such instances
of noncompliance would not reasonably be expected to have a Purchaser Material
Adverse Effect or a material adverse effect on the ability of Purchaser to enter
into and perform its obligations under this Agreement.

     3.6  Governmental Consents. Assuming the truth and completeness of the
representations and warranties of each of the Sellers contained in this
Agreement, no consent, approval or authorization of, or designation, declaration
or filing with, any Governmental Authority is required on the part of Purchaser
with respect to Purchaser's execution or delivery of this Agreement or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, except for (i) applicable
requirements of the HSR Act, (ii) the filing with the SEC of such reports under
the Exchange Act as may be required in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby, and (iii) such consents, approvals, authorizations,
designations, declarations, and filings the failure of which to obtain would not
reasonably be expected to have a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect or a material
adverse effect on the ability of Purchaser to enter into and perform its
obligations under this Agreement.

     3.7  Brokers' Fees. No broker, finder, investment banker or other Person is
entitled to any brokerage fee, finders' fee or other commission in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements
made by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates.

     3.8  Purchaser Acknowledgment.

          (a)  PURCHASER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE SELLERS MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS
OR WARRANTIES CONCERNING THE SELLERS, THEIR RESPECTIVE ASSETS (INCLUDING,
WITHOUT LIMITATION, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY) OR THE BUSINESS OTHER THAN AS
EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN ARTICLE 2 HEREOF AND THAT THE SELLERS EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM
ALL OTHER REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY
WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

          (b)  Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that (i) it has made its own
inquiry and investigation into, and, based thereon, has formed an independent
judgment concerning the Business, and (ii) it has been furnished with or given
adequate access to such information about the Business as it has requested.

                                   ARTICLE 4.

will become due and payable from Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries on or
after the Closing Date; (vi) promote any Business Employee; or (vii) make any
change in the key management structure of the Transferred Business, including,

$50,000 per project or $100,000 in the aggregate for all projects; or

<PAGE>

               (a)  Except as permitted by this Agreement, neither Seller shall
authorize any of its respective officers, directors or employees, or any
financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other representative retained by any
of them, to (i) solicit, initiate or encourage (including by way of furnishing
material, nonpublic information regarding the Assets or the Transferred
Business) the making or submission of any Acquisition Proposal, or (ii)
participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding an Acquisition
Proposal; provided, however, that, at any time prior to the approval of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by the holders of Parent Common
Stock, if either of the Sellers receives an inquiry that did not result from a
breach of this Section 4.2(a) and (x) Parent determines in good faith, after
having considered the advice of outside counsel, that such inquiry could
reasonably likely result in a Superior Proposal and (y) Parent receives from
such Person an executed confidentiality agreement containing customary
limitations (in any event at least as stringent as those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement between Purchaser and Parent) on the use and
disclosure of all information furnished to such Person by or on behalf of Parent
or Opco, then the Sellers may furnish information, including, without
limitation, non-public information, with respect to the Sellers, the Business
and the Assets to the person who made such inquiry and the Sellers may
participate in negotiations regarding such Acquisition Proposal.

               (b)  Parent shall promptly (but in any event within two Business
Days) notify Purchaser orally and in writing of any Acquisition Proposal
(including the identity of the Person making such Acquisition Proposal and the
material terms of any such Acquisition Proposal) that is made or submitted by
any Person. Parent shall thereafter inform Purchaser on a reasonably prompt
basis of any material changes to the terms and conditions of such Acquisition
Proposal, and shall reasonably promptly give Purchaser a copy of any nonpublic
information regarding the Transferred Business delivered to such Person to the
extent not previously delivered to Purchaser or its representatives.

               (c)  Promptly after the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
the Sellers will, and will request their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates,
officers, directors, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and
other agents to, cease and terminate any existing discussions or negotiations
with any parties conducted heretofore with respect to any possible Acquisition
Proposal, subject in any case to the rights of the Sellers under Section 4.2(a).
Parent agrees that it will take the necessary steps to promptly inform the
individuals or entities referred to in the first sentence hereof of the
obligations undertaken in this 4.2.

               (d)  Parent's Board of Directors may withdraw or modify, in a
manner adverse to Purchaser, its approval or recommendation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement only in the event Parent's Board of Directors (i)
receives a Superior Proposal, and (ii) determines in good faith that the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are no longer in the best interests
of Parent's stockholders.

               (e)  Nothing contained in this Section 4.2 shall prohibit Parent
from at any time disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule
14d-9 or Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any
required disclosure to Parent's stockholders.

               (f)  "Acquisition Proposal" means, other than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, any proposed or actual (i) sale, lease or other
disposition of any assets of the

                                       26

<PAGE>

Sellers representing 20% or more of the Assets or (ii) liquidation, dissolution,
or other similar type of transaction with respect to either of the Sellers.

               (g)  "Superior Proposal" means any proposed or actual (i)
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) merger, consolidation or similar transaction
involving either of the Sellers, (iii) issue, sale or other disposition by
either Seller of (including by way of merger, consolidation, share exchange or
similar transaction) securities (or options, rights or warrants to purchase, or
securities convertible into, such securities) representing 50% or more of the
votes associated with the outstanding securities of either Seller, (iv) tender
offer or exchange offer in which any third party would acquire beneficial
ownership (as such term is defined in Section 13d-3 under the Exchange Act), or
the right to acquire beneficial ownership, of 50% or more of the outstanding
shares of either Seller's common stock, (v) recapitalization, restructuring, or
other similar type of transaction with respect to either of the Sellers, or (vi)
transaction that is similar in form, substance or purpose to any of the
foregoing transactions, in any case that Parent's Board of Directors determines
in good faith, after consultation with its financial adviser and outside legal
counsel, is likely to be consummated and would, if consummated, result in a
transaction that is more favorable from a financial point of view to Parent's
stockholders than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

                                   ARTICLE 5.
                              ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

        5.1    Parent Stockholder Meeting; Proxy Statement.

               (a)  Unless the holders of the requisite number of shares of
Parent Common Stock approve the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by
written consent ("Stockholders' Written Consent"), Parent shall, to the extent
permitted under Delaware law, take all action reasonably necessary in accordance
with applicable law and Parent's certificate of incorporation and bylaws to duly
call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders (the
"Stockholders Meeting") as promptly as practicable after the date hereof for the
purpose of, among other things, considering and taking action, as necessary,
upon the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In the event the
Stockholders' Written Consent is obtained, Parent shall promptly, and in any
event within 10 Business Days after the date of this Agreement, give, or cause
to be given, to holders of Parent Common Stock the notice required under Section
228(e) of the Delaware General Corporation Law.

               (b)  As promptly as practicable after the date hereof, Parent
shall take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be done, all
things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to (i) prepare and file with
the SEC any documents or materials, including, but not limited to, the proxy
statement and related materials for the Stockholders Meeting, or, if the
Stockholders' Written Consent has been obtained, the information statement
relating thereto, as the case may be (the "Proxy Materials") and (ii) have the
Proxy Materials cleared by the SEC. Subject to Section 4.2, the Proxy Materials
(if prepared for the Stockholders Meeting) shall contain the recommendation of
Parent's Board of Directors that stockholders of Parent vote in favor of the
approval of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Parent shall notify
Purchaser promptly of the receipt of any comments on, or any requests for
amendments or supplements to, the Proxy Materials by the SEC, and Parent shall
supply Purchaser with copies of all written correspondence between Parent and
its representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or members of its staff, on
the other, with respect to the Proxy Materials. Parent shall use

                                       27

<PAGE>

its reasonable best efforts to respond promptly to any comments made by the SEC
with respect to the Proxy Materials. Parent and Purchaser shall cooperate with
each other in preparing the Proxy Materials, and Parent and Purchaser shall each
use its reasonable best efforts to obtain any consents required to be included
in the Proxy Materials. Purchaser shall provide any information Parent
reasonably requests for inclusion in the Proxy Materials. Parent and Purchaser
each agrees promptly to correct any information provided by it for use in the
Proxy Materials if and to the extent that such information shall have become
false or misleading in any material respect, and Parent further agrees to take
all steps necessary to cause the Proxy Materials, as so corrected, to be filed
with the SEC and to be disseminated promptly to holders of shares of Parent
Common Stock, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable law.

               (c)  Parent agrees that the information contained in the Proxy
Materials (other than information with respect to Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates, which shall have been supplied in writing by them or any of their
authorized representatives expressly for use in or in preparing the Proxy
Materials) will not, at the date the Proxy Materials are filed with the SEC or
at the date of mailing to Parent's stockholders or at the date of the
Stockholders Meeting, contain any statement that, at the time and in light of
the circumstances under which it is made, is false or misleading with respect to
any material fact, and will not omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make any statement therein of a material fact, in
the light of the circumstances under which it is made, not misleading or to
correct any statement in any earlier communication with respect to the
solicitation of proxies for the Stockholders Meeting. The Proxy Materials will
comply as to form in all material respects with the Exchange Act and the rules
and regulations of the SEC thereunder.

               (d)  Purchaser agrees that the information provided by it for
inclusion in the Proxy Materials will not, at the date of mailing to Parent's
stockholders or at the date of the Stockholders Meeting, contain any statement
that, at the time and in light of the circumstances under which it is made, is
false or misleading with respect to any material fact, and will not omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make any
statement therein of a material fact, in the light of the circumstances under
which it is made, not misleading or to correct any statement in any earlier
communication with respect to the solicitation of proxies for the Stockholders
Meeting.

         5.2   Support of Transaction. Purchaser and each of the Sellers shall
(i) use its reasonable best efforts to assemble, prepare and file any
information (and, as needed, to supplement such information) as may be
reasonably necessary to obtain as promptly as practicable all governmental and
regulatory consents required to be obtained in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby, (ii) use its reasonable best efforts to obtain all material
consents and approvals of third parties that any of Purchaser, the Sellers, or
their respective Affiliates are required to obtain in order to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, and (iii) take such other action as may
reasonably be necessary or as another party may reasonably request to satisfy
the conditions of Article 6 or otherwise to comply with this Agreement,
provided, however, that the Sellers' obligations with respect to Purchaser's
financing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be limited to
those described in Section 5.9.

         5.3   Inspection. Subject to that certain letter agreement, dated as of
May 18, 2002, between Purchaser and Parent (as amended, the "Confidentiality
Agreement"), each of the Sellers and Purchaser shall, and shall cause their
respective subsidiaries, to afford to the other

                                       28

<PAGE>

parties and their respective accountants, counsel and other representatives
reasonable access, during normal business hours, to the respective properties,
books, contracts, commitments, tax returns, records and appropriate officers and
employees of Purchaser and its subsidiaries or the Transferred Business, as the
case may be, and shall furnish such representatives with all financial and
operating data and other information concerning the affairs of Purchaser and it
subsidiaries or the Transferred Business, as the case may be, that they may
reasonably request.

         5.4   HSR Act.

               (a)  In connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, each of Purchaser and Parent (and, to the extent required, its
respective Affiliates) shall comply promptly, but in any event within ten (10)
Business Days of the date of this Agreement, with the notification and reporting
requirements of the HSR Act and use its reasonable best efforts to obtain early
termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act. Each of Purchaser and
Parent shall substantially comply with any additional requests for information,
including requests for production of documents and production of witnesses for
interviews or depositions, by any Antitrust Authorities.

               (b)  Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts, and the
Sellers shall cooperate fully with Purchaser, to prevent the entry in any Action
brought by an Antitrust Authority or any other Person of any Governmental Order
which would prohibit, make unlawful or delay the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

         5.5   Update Information. Not earlier than ten (10) and not less than
three (3) days before the date scheduled for Closing, the Sellers shall correct
and supplement in writing any information furnished on the Schedules that, to
the knowledge of the Sellers, is incorrect or incomplete, and shall promptly
furnish such corrected and supplemented information to the other, so that such
information shall be correct and complete to the knowledge of such party at the
time such updated information is so provided. Thereafter, prior to the Closing,
the Sellers shall notify Purchaser in writing of any changes or supplements to
the updated information needed, to the knowledge of Sellers, to make such
information correct and complete to the knowledge of such party as of the
Closing. It is agreed that the furnishing of such corrected and supplemental
information, in and of itself, shall not create any presumption that such
information constitutes or evidences the existence of a material change or any
breach or violation by Seller of any provision of this Agreement. For purposes
of determining the fulfillment of the conditions precedent set forth in Article
6, no such amendment or supplement shall be given effect; for all other
purposes, including, without limitation, Article 8, each such amendment or
supplement shall be given full effect.

         5.6   Certain Employee Benefits Matters.

               (a)  All of the Business Employees who are actively employed
(including those on vacation) on the Closing Date shall be offered employment on
an "at will" basis with the Purchaser on such date, and such individuals who
accept such offer on such date shall be referred to as "Transferred Employees."
Each such offer of employment shall be (i) at the same salary or hourly wage
rate and position in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date and (ii) at
the same location or within 20 miles from the location of such employment
immediately prior to the Closing Date. Purchaser shall also offer employment on
an "at will" basis to each Business Employee who is temporarily absent from
active employment on the Closing Date upon

                                       29

<PAGE>

termination of such temporary absence within six months following the Closing
Date, provided that such individual is able to perform the essential functions
of the position he or she previously held with the Sellers prior to such
absence, and any such individual shall be treated as a "Transferred Employee"
from and after his or her date of employment with Purchaser. For a period of 12
months following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall provide benefits to the
Business Employees that, in the aggregate, (i) are substantially equivalent to
those provided by Purchaser to its other similarly situated employees as of the
Closing Date and (ii) are no less favorable than those provided by the Sellers
and their Subsidiaries under the Benefit Plans (other than benefits relating to
stock options or other equity-based compensation) to such Business Employees
immediately prior to the Closing Date. Purchaser shall cause Purchaser's
employee benefit plans and arrangements (including, but not limited to, all
"employee benefit plans" within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA and all
plans, programs, policies and employee fringe benefit programs, including
vacation policies), to the extent Purchaser makes them available to Business
Employees, to recognize, solely for the purposes of determining the vesting of
benefits and participation eligibility (but not for benefit accrual), all
service by Transferred Employees with the Sellers, including service with
predecessor employers, to the extent that such service was recognized by the
analogous benefit plans of Purchaser, provided that such recognition does not
result in any duplication of benefits. Individuals who have terminated
employment with Sellers prior to the Closing Date and are subsequently hired by
Purchaser and its Affiliates will not be entitled to any service recognition
under this paragraph. Transferred Employees shall also be given credit for any
deductible, co-payment amounts or out-of-pocket expenses paid in respect of the
plan year in which the Closing occurs, to the extent that, following the
Closing, they participate in any corresponding plan maintained or sponsored by
Purchaser for which deductibles or co-payments are required.

               (b)  Purchaser agrees that any pre-existing condition exclusions
or waiting periods or evidence of insurability requirements imposed under
Purchaser's welfare benefit plans will be waived with respect to any Transferred
Employee and his or her covered dependents to the same extent that such
exclusions, waiting periods or evidence of insurability did not preclude his or
her participation in the equivalent plan of the Sellers.

               (c)  Sellers and their ERISA Affiliates shall be exclusively
responsible for complying with COBRA with respect to their employees with
respect to any "qualifying event" as such term is defined in COBRA, occurring on
or prior to the Closing Date.

               (d)  Seller agrees to cause the accrued benefits and account
balances of Transferred Employees under the Star Tobacco 401(k) Plan ("Sellers'
401(k) Plan") to be 100% vested effective as of the Closing Date.

               (e)  Effective as of the Closing Date, Purchaser shall establish
for the benefit of the Transferred Employees who, immediately prior to the
Closing Date were participants in the Sellers' 401(k) Plan, a tax-qualified
defined contribution plan or shall designate a pre-existing tax-qualified
defined contribution plan, (in either case, "Purchaser's Plan"), which shall
qualify as a cash or deferred plan under Section 401(k) of the Code and shall
provide benefits only with respect to service after the Closing Date. Service
with Seller or any prior employer recognized under the Sellers' 401(k) Plan
shall be recognized for eligibility, vesting and all other purposes under
Purchaser's Plan. As soon as practicable after Purchaser's Plan is determined to
be a tax qualified plan, Transferred Employees shall be permitted to make a
rollover contribution from the Sellers' 401(k) Plan to Purchaser's Plan.

                                       30

<PAGE>

          (f)  Purchaser shall be liable for all obligations with respect to
claims of Transferred Employees for (i) workers compensation for incidents
occurring on or after the Closing Date and (ii) for claims of such Transferred
Employees that arise from or relate to facts, circumstances or conduct that
occurred or are deemed to occur on or after the Closing Date. With respect to
Transferred Employees, (i) a claim for health benefits (including, without
limitation, claims for medical, prescription drug and dental expenses) will be
deemed to have been incurred on the date on which the related medical service or
material was rendered to or received by the Transferred Employee claiming such
benefit, (ii) a claim for sickness or disability benefits based on an injury or
illness occurring prior to the Closing Date will be deemed to have been incurred
prior to the Closing Date, and (iii) in the case of any claim for benefits other
than health benefits and sickness and disability benefits (e.g., life insurance
benefits), a claim will be deemed to have been incurred upon the occurrence of
the event giving rise to such claims.

          (g)  Prior to Closing, and in any event within 90 days of the date of
this Agreement, Purchaser shall, after consultation with the Sellers, establish
a Retention Plan (the "Retention Plan") in an amount equal to $2,000,000 in the
aggregate for payment to the Transferred Employees (i) who are employed by
Purchaser or its Affiliates on the first anniversary of the Closing Date or (ii)
whose employment with Purchaser or its Affiliates has been terminated by
Purchaser or its Affiliates other than for Cause prior to the first anniversary
of the Closing Date. The aggregate of $2,000,000 of payments shall be allocated
among the Transferred Employees in the manner set forth in the Retention Plan,
except that in the event one or more Transferred Employees terminates their
employment prior to the first anniversary of the Closing Date or the employment
of one or more Transferred Employees is terminated by Purchaser or its
Affiliates for Cause prior to such first anniversary, the $2,000,000 initially
allocated under the Retention Plan shall be reduced by the amounts allocated to
such Transferred Employees. As promptly as practicable after establishing the
Retention Plan, and in any event within 90 days of the date of this Agreement,
Purchaser shall deliver to Parent a copy of the Retention Plan and the Sellers
shall be entitled to disclose to the Transferred Employees the terms of the
Retention Plan. For purposes of the Retention Plan, "Cause" shall mean the
termination of the employee's employment by reason of any one or more of the
following: (i) failure, in the reasonable judgment of Purchaser, of the employee
to satisfactorily perform the employee's duties; (ii) fraud or dishonesty in the
performance of the employee's duties; or (iii) a breach of any of the policies
of "General Conduct" contained in the Employee Handbook of Star Tobacco &
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. to the extent such breach would be grounds for a
termination for cause under such Employee Handbook. A failure of an employee to
relocate the place of his employment beyond 20 miles from the current location
of such employment at the request of Purchaser will not constitute "Cause" for
termination of employment.

          (h)  Nothing contained in this Agreement shall confer upon any
Transferred Employee any rights with respect to continuance of employment by
Purchaser, nor shall any provision of this Agreement create any third party
beneficiary rights (other than with respect to the Retention Plan) in any
Transferred Employee, any beneficiary or dependents thereof, or any collective
bargaining representative thereof. Subject to applicable laws, Purchaser shall
have the right to dismiss any or all Transferred Employees at any time, with or
without cause, and to change the terms and conditions of their employment
(including compensation and employee benefits provided to them).

                                       31

<PAGE>

          (i)  Pursuant to the "Alternative Procedure" provided in section 5 of
Revenue Procedure 96-60, 1996-2 C.B. 399, (i) Purchaser and Sellers shall report
on a predecessor/successor basis as set forth therein, (ii) Sellers will be
relieved from filing a Form W-2 with respect to the Transferred Employees who
accept Buyer's offer of employment and (iii) Purchaser will undertake to file
(or cause to be filed) a Form W-2 for each such employee for the year that
includes the Closing Date (including the portion of such year that such employee
was employed by Seller). Sellers will provide Purchaser on a timely basis with
all payroll and employment-related information with respect to each such
employee.

     5.7  Escrow Obligations.

          (a)  On or prior to the Termination Date, the Sellers shall use
reasonable best efforts to satisfy the condition set forth in Section 6.2(h).
For the purposes of this Section 5.7(a), "reasonable best efforts" shall include
payment of any and all amounts into the Sellers' escrow accounts maintained in
accordance with the Qualifying Statutes, and any other payments required under
the Qualifying Statutes, as shall be necessary, as determined by the applicable
states or other applicable Governmental Authority, to cause the Sellers to be in
compliance with the Qualifying Statutes, including, without limitation, using or
directing the use of proceeds from the transactions contemplated hereby for such
purpose. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Sellers
shall not have any obligation under this Agreement to agree with any MSA States
to take any action, or make any commitment, other than with respect to the
payment of cash into the Sellers' escrow accounts maintained in accordance with
the Qualifying Statutes.

          (b)  The Sellers shall provide to Purchaser, at least two Business
Days prior to the Closing Date: (i) their good faith estimate, which shall be
based on the Sellers' shipping records of direct sales into the MSA States and
shall be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser, of their
Escrow Obligations with respect to the number of units of Brand cigarettes tax
stamped in each MSA State during the Closing Year prior to and including the
Closing Date and (ii) written instructions to Purchaser to direct a portion of
the Purchase Price equal to the aggregate amount of such Escrow Obligations into
an escrow account established pursuant to an escrow agreement, in the form of
Annex P, among the Escrow Agent, the Sellers and Purchaser (the "Post-Closing
Escrow Agreement"), which the Sellers and Purchaser each agree to execute and
deliver to the other parties hereto on or prior to the Closing Date. The Sellers
and Purchaser shall, upon determination of the Sellers' Closing Year Escrow
Obligation for each MSA State in accordance with this Section 5.7, cooperate to
cause the Escrow Agent to promptly deliver to each MSA State, to the extent of
the funds remaining in the escrow account maintained in accordance with the
Post-Closing Escrow Agreement, the funds necessary to satisfy the Sellers'
Closing Year Escrow Obligation for such MSA State. Purchaser shall cooperate
with the Sellers to cause the Escrow Agent promptly to release to the Sellers
any amounts remaining in such escrow account after the Sellers have satisfied
(including by payments from such escrow account) the Sellers' Closing Year
Escrow Obligation for each MSA State.

          (c)  At least ten days prior to the anticipated Closing Date, the
Sellers shall send to each distributor to whom the Sellers have sold cigarette
products since January 1, 2003 a written notice in such form approved by
Purchaser, such approval not unreasonably to be withheld or delayed. Such
written notice shall (i) inform such distributor of the sale of the

                                       32

<PAGE>

Assets contemplated by this Agreement and the anticipated Closing Date and (ii)
request that, after the Closing Date, each such distributor identify Purchaser,
rather than the Sellers, as the manufacturer of cigarettes sold under the Brands
after the Closing Date. Promptly following the Closing Date (but not later than
five Business Days thereafter), the Sellers shall send to each such distributor
a further written notice, which shall (i) inform such distributor of the Closing
Date and (ii) reiterate the request referred to in clause (ii) of the
immediately preceding sentence.

          (d)  Promptly following the Closing Date, the Sellers shall notify the
tobacco enforcement section (or comparable department) of the office of the
Attorney General (or other applicable regulatory office) for each State and the
District of Columbia party to the Master Settlement Agreement (each such State
and the District of Columbia, an "MSA State") of the Closing and the transfer of
the Transferred Business to Purchaser effective the Closing Date. Such notice
shall state that the Sellers ceased manufacturing cigarettes as of the Closing
Date and shall request that the MSA State confirm to the Sellers the number of
units of Brand cigarettes that were tax stamped in such MSA State from the
period beginning on January 1 of the year in which the Closing occurs (the
"Closing Year") and ending on the last calendar day of the month in which the
Closing occurs (such period the "MSA Cut-off Period" and such number of units
tax stamped by such MSA State during the MSA Cut-off Period, the "Cut-off Period
Data").

          (e)  The Sellers and Purchaser each covenant and agree to satisfy all
Escrow Obligations for sales of Brand cigarettes during the Closing Year as
provided in the Qualifying Statutes. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any
assertion by an MSA State to the contrary, subject to Section 5.7(i), the
parties agree that, as between the Sellers and Purchaser, the Sellers' Escrow
Obligations for the sale of Brand cigarettes in any MSA State during the Closing
Year (for each such MSA State, "Sellers' Closing Year Escrow Obligation") shall
be:

               (i)   with respect to any MSA State providing Cut-off Period
Data, the escrow deposits required for the sale of (i) the number of units of
Brand cigarettes tax stamped in such MSA State during the Closing Year prior to
the month in which the Closing occurs plus (ii) the Sellers' Closing Month
Units.

               (ii)  with respect to any other MSA State, the escrow deposits
required for the sale of (i) the number of units of Brand cigarettes sold by the
Sellers directly into such MSA State during the MSA Cut-off Period plus (ii)
Sellers' Allocable Portion of such MSA State's Total Asserted Indirect Sales.

          (f)  The Sellers' obligation to make the Sellers' Closing Year Escrow
Obligations shall be deemed to be an Excluded Liability. The Sellers will use
reasonable best efforts to satisfy the Sellers' Closing Year Escrow Obligations
on or prior to April 1, 2004 and will reasonably promptly notify Purchaser of
the amounts deposited with respect to each MSA State. As between the Sellers and
Purchaser, other than the Sellers' Closing Year Escrow Obligations, Purchaser
shall be responsible for all Escrow Obligations related to the sale of
cigarettes under the Brands during and after the Closing Year, and such Escrow
Obligations shall be deemed to be Assumed Liabilities.

          (g)  Promptly upon receipt of Cut-off Period Data from any MSA State,
the Sellers shall notify the tobacco enforcement section (or comparable
department) of the office of Attorney General for such MSA State of Sellers'
intention to make escrow deposits for sale of

                                       33

<PAGE>

the Brand cigarettes by the Sellers in such MSA State during the Closing Year
equal to the Sellers' Closing Year Escrow Obligation for such MSA State and
shall request that such MSA State confirm the sufficiency of such escrow
deposits. On or prior to April 1, 2004, the Sellers shall notify the office of
the Attorney General of each MSA State not providing Cut-off Period Data of the
Sellers' calculation of the Sellers' Closing Year Escrow Obligation with respect
to such MSA State and of Sellers' intention to make escrow deposits of such
amount for sale of the Brand cigarettes by the Sellers in such MSA States during
the Closing Year and shall request that such MSA State confirm the sufficiency
of such escrow deposit.

          (h)  Subject to Section 5.7(i), in the event that any MSA State shall
assert that the Sellers' Escrow Obligations for Brand cigarettes sold in such
MSA State during the Closing Year (such asserted amount, an "Asserted Escrow
Obligation") is different than the Sellers' Closing Year Escrow Obligation, the
parties agree to cooperate in good faith to seek to convince such MSA State to
accept as sufficient the Sellers' Closing Year Escrow Obligation with respect to
such MSA State. If such efforts are unsuccessful and the amount of the escrow
deposit that the Sellers are required to make for such MSA State exceeds the
Sellers' Closing Year Escrow Obligation for such MSA State, then such excess
amount will represent an Assumed Liability and Purchaser shall promptly pay such
excess amount into the escrow account maintained by the Sellers with respect to
such MSA State. If such efforts are unsuccessful and the amount of the escrow
deposit that the Sellers are required to make for such MSA State is less than
the Sellers' Closing Year Escrow Obligation for such MSA State, then the amount
of such deficit will represent an Excluded Liability and the Sellers shall
promptly pay such excess amount into the escrow account maintained by Purchaser
with respect to such MSA State.

          (i)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if
the Sellers enter into a binding agreement with any MSA State pursuant to which
the Sellers' Escrow Obligations for the sale of Brand cigarettes in such MSA
State during the Closing Year are released or otherwise determined to be an
amount less than the amount determined pursuant to Section 5.7(e), and such
release or determination is effective and not subject to any pre-Closing or
post-Closing conditions, then for all purposes of this Agreement the Sellers'
Closing Year Escrow Obligation for each such MSA State shall be deemed to be the
amount owed by the Sellers to such MSA State under such agreement between the
Sellers and such MSA State.

          (j)  Definitions. The following terms, when used in this Section 5.7,
shall have the following meanings, and any of these terms may, unless the
context otherwise requires, be used in the singular or the plural depending on
the reference:

               (i)    "Sellers' Allocable Portion" means the ratio of the
Sellers' Closing Year Production to the Total Closing Year Production.

               (ii)   "Sellers' Closing Year Production" means the total number
of units of Brand cigarettes removed by the Sellers from bond during the Closing
Year, according to applicable BATF records.

               (iii)  "Total Closing Year Production" means the sum of (i) the
total number of units of Brand cigarettes removed by Purchaser from bond during
the Closing Year, according to applicable BATF records, plus (ii) the Sellers'
Closing Year Production.

                                       34

<PAGE>

               (iv)  "Sellers' Closing Month Units" with respect to any MSA
State means the number of units of Brand cigarettes tax stamped in any such MSA
State during the calendar month in which the Closing occurs multiplied by a
fraction the numerator of which is the number of days from the beginning of the
Closing Month through and including the Closing Date and the denominator of
which is the number of days in the Closing Month.

               (v)   "Total Asserted Indirect Sales" means, with respect to any
MSA State, the total number of aggregate units of Brand cigarettes asserted by
such MSA State to have been sold in such MSA State during the Closing Year minus
the aggregate number of units of Brand cigarettes sold by the Sellers and
Purchaser directly into such MSA State during the Closing Year.

     5.8  Cooperation Regarding Packaging. Purchaser and the Sellers shall use
reasonable best efforts to ensure that, as promptly as practicable after the
Closing Date, but in any event within three months after the Closing Date, all
packaging of product sold in the Transferred Business refers only to Purchaser
and its BATF permit numbers, and not to either of the Sellers or any BATF permit
that they hold or any Excluded Intellectual Property. Without limiting the
foregoing, Purchaser and the Sellers shall cooperate in good faith in their
communications with BATF with respect to the transition of packaging materials
used in the Transferred Business. So long as Purchaser is complying with its
obligations under this Section 5.8, Purchaser shall be permitted to sell
existing inventory included in the Assets bearing marks constituting Excluded
Intellectual Property until the earlier of (i) three months after the Closing
Date and (ii) the date on which existing inventories are exhausted, provided
that Purchaser complies in all material respects with all applicable laws, rules
and regulations in any use of packaging, labeling or advertising containing such
marks and obtains all BATF authorizations required therefor.

     5.9  Financing.

          (a)  In furtherance of and without limiting the generality of Section
5.2, Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange and consummate
the financing necessary for it to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including using its reasonable best efforts (A) to negotiate in
good faith definitive agreements respecting such financing on reasonable terms
with respect thereto, (B) to satisfy all conditions provided in such definitive
agreements, (C) to negotiate in good faith such modifications to such financing
as may be necessary or advisable to reflect any change in market conditions
which occurs after the date of this Agreement, (D) if any portion of such
financing has become unavailable, regardless of the reason therefor, to obtain
alternative financing from the same or other sources on and subject to
substantially the same terms and conditions as that portion which has become
unavailable and (E) to satisfy at or prior to the Closing all requirements of
any agreements under which such financing is to be provided and conditions to
the drawdown of proceeds thereunder. Purchaser agrees that it will use its
reasonable best efforts to exercise all of its rights to enforce performance of
any agreements under which Purchaser is entitled to receive financing with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and will not waive,
modify or amend any of its rights under such agreements in any material respect.

          (b)  Purchaser shall keep Parent informed as to the material terms and
status of its arrangements with respect to its financing of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, as reasonably requested by Parent. When
preparing any prospectus, registration statement or other marketing or
solicitation documents and all other documents to be used by

                                       35

<PAGE>

Purchaser in connection with Purchaser's financing of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (the "Financing Documents"), Purchaser shall
consult with the Sellers with respect to any description in the Financing
Documents of the Sellers, the Business or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and will make reasonable changes to such descriptions as requested by
the Sellers. Purchaser will provide drafts of all such Financing Documents to
the Sellers and allow the Sellers a reasonable amount of time to review and
comment on such documents prior to their circulation to third parties or filing
with any Governmental Authority.

          (c)  For purposes of assisting Parent with the financing contemplated
in this Section 5.9, Parent shall provide to Purchaser (i) the financial
statements of the Business prepared and audited in accordance with Regulation
S-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission for the periods that would be
required under Rule 3-05(b) of Regulation S-X, (ii) any other historical
information and data with respect to the Transferred Business that would be
required to be included in a registration statement on Form S-1 filed by
Purchaser under the Securities Act (a "Form S-1"), (iii) in the event the
Sellers have entered into an agreement with respect to the matters covered by
the Draft Settlement Agreement, a correct and complete copy of the executed
agreement, and (iv) any Transferred Contract that Purchaser would be required to
file as an exhibit to a Form S-1. The Sellers shall provide such additional
cooperation to Purchaser in connection with the preparation of the Financing
Documents as is reasonably requested by Purchaser.

     5.10 Post-Closing Notification of Product Returns. In order to facilitate
the Sellers' obtaining of refunds of federal excise taxes with respect to
returned products sold by the Business on or prior to the Closing Date,
Purchaser shall promptly notify the Sellers in writing at any time, and from
time to time, in any event that Purchaser receives any return of products sold
by the Business on or prior to the Closing Date. Purchaser shall cooperate in
good faith with the Sellers to return such products to the Sellers, as
reasonably requested by the Sellers.

     5.11 Master Settlement Agreement. Without the prior written consent of
Purchaser, prior to the Closing neither of the Sellers shall enter into an
agreement to become a participating manufacturer under the Master Settlement
Agreement with respect to the Transferred Business.

     5.12 [Intentionally Omitted.]

     5.13 Moist Snuff Equipment. Parent shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to purchase the Moist Snuff Equipment from the Moist Snuff Lessor,
effective on or prior to the Closing Date, at a price no greater than that set
forth on Schedule 5.13 with respect to the applicable date of the Closing.
Reasonably promptly after Parent and the Moist Snuff Lessor agree in writing to
the terms of Parent's purchase of the Moist Snuff Equipment, Parent shall
deliver to Purchaser a copy of such agreement. The purchase price under such
agreement, as amended, shall be referred to herein as the "Moist Snuff Equipment
Price". Subject to the completion of Parent's purchase of the Moist Snuff
Equipment under such agreement, as amended, on or prior to the Closing Date, the
Moist Snuff Equipment will be deemed to be an "Asset" under Section 1.1 and the
Purchase Price will be increased by the Moist Snuff Equipment Price.

     5.14 Transition Services. For 90 days after the Closing Date (or, with
respect to any particular service, if applicable, the shorter or longer duration
described in Schedule 5.14), the Sellers shall provide to Purchaser with respect
to the Transferred Business the services listed in

                                       36

<PAGE>

Schedule 5.14, and any other services reasonably requested by Purchaser to
facilitate transition of the Transferred Business to Purchaser (to the extent
the Sellers are able to render such services after the Closing Date), on the
terms and conditions set forth herein, except as set forth in Schedule 5.14.
Purchaser shall reimburse the Sellers for their out-of-pocket costs and expenses
incurred in connection with rendering these services, including all employment
costs (including, without limitation, salary and benefits) reasonably allocated
by the Sellers to such services, but not for the Sellers' general overhead
costs. The Sellers shall be obligated to render services pursuant to this
Section 5.14 only to the extent reasonably necessary to assist Purchaser in
achieving an orderly transfer of the Transferred Business from the Sellers to
Purchaser, and shall be permitted to render such services in a manner reasonably
determined to minimize any disruption to the Retained Businesses caused by the
rendering of such services.

                                   ARTICLE 6.
                            CONDITIONS TO OBLIGATIONS

          (b)  All necessary permits, approvals, clearances, and consents of,
and all filings with, Governmental Authorities required to be procured by
Purchaser or the Sellers in order to complete the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement shall have been procured, it being understood, however, that any
consents, authorizations or approvals (other than those, if any, required to be
obtained from the BATF), the absence of which would not have a material adverse
effect on the business, operations or financial condition of Purchaser or the
Sellers, as applicable, in each case taken as a whole, need not be obtained.

          (c)  There shall not be in force any order, decree, injunction,
statute, rule or regulation of any Governmental Authority prohibiting the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

          (d)  Parent shall have obtained from its stockholders any necessary
approval of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and, in the case of
any such approval other than at the Stockholders Meeting, the requirements of
Regulation 14C, promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended, shall have been satisfied.

     6.2  Conditions to Obligations of Purchaser. The obligations of Purchaser
to consummate, or cause to be consummated, the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are subject to the satisfaction of the following additional
conditions, any one or more of which may be waived in writing by Purchaser:

                                       37

<PAGE>

of that date). The representations and warranties of each of the Sellers
contained in this Agreement that are not qualified by Business Material Adverse
Effect shall be true and correct in all respects as of the date hereof and as of
the Closing, as if made anew at and as of that time (other than representations
and warranties made as of a specified date, which shall be true and correct as
of that date), except where all such failures to be true and correct,
individually or in the aggregate, do not constitute a Business Material Adverse
Effect.

          (b)  Each of the covenants and agreements of each of the Sellers to be
performed as of or prior to the Closing shall have been duly performed in all
material respects.

          (c)  Each of the Sellers shall have delivered to Purchaser a
certificate signed by an officer of such Seller, dated as of the Closing Date,
certifying that the conditions specified in Sections 6.2(a) and 6.2(b) have been

          (d)  From the date of this Agreement to the Closing Date, there shall

          (e)  Each of the Sellers shall have delivered to Purchaser the

          (f)  The Sellers shall have executed and delivered to Purchaser the

          (g)  Purchaser shall have obtained all financing necessary for it to

          (h)  Each of the Sellers shall be in compliance with the Qualifying
Statutes. Without limiting the generality of the immediately preceding sentence,
for purposes of this Section 6.2(h), the Sellers shall be deemed to be in
compliance with the Qualifying Statutes with respect to any MSA State if (i) the
Sellers shall have received a written release with respect to any and all
liability under the Qualifying Statutes of such MSA State for the years
1999-2002, which release is effective on the Closing Date, and is not subject to
any pre-Closing or post-Closing condition (other than, if applicable, the making
of any payment contemplated by the immediately following sentence), (ii) the
Sellers shall have entered into an agreement with such MSA State which provides
for a release with respect to any and all liabilities under the Qualifying
Statutes of such MSA State for the years 1999-2002 subject to the satisfaction
of certain conditions, performance obligations or reaching agreements in the
future (collectively, "Release Conditions"), and (A) such Agreement is in full
force and effect on the Closing Date, (B) all Release Conditions have been
satisfied (other than, if applicable, the making of any payment contemplated by
the immediately following sentence) and (C) the Sellers have provided Purchaser
with reasonable evidence of the matters referred to in clauses (A) and (B) above
(which may include the written acknowledgement of such MSA State or the National
Association of Attorneys General to the effect that such agreement is in full
force and effect and that all Release Conditions have been satisfied), or (iii)
the Sellers have paid all amounts (other than, if applicable, the making of any
payment contemplated by the immediately following sentence) asserted by such MSA
State in writing to be required for the Sellers to be in compliance and either
(A) the Sellers have provided Purchaser with reasonable evidence that they have
paid such amounts or (B) such MSA State has acknowledged in writing that the
payment of such amounts on the Closing Date is sufficient to satisfy the
Sellers' obligations

                                       38

<PAGE>

under the applicable Qualifying Statutes. In any case where the making of a
payment by the Sellers on the Closing Date is required to satisfy the condition
set forth in this Section 6.2(h), such payment shall be deemed to have occurred
upon the Sellers' direction to Purchaser to pay, at the Closing, all or a
portion of the Purchase Price to satisfy such obligation of the Sellers. For
purposes of clauses (i) and (ii) of this Section 6.2(h), a release from all
claims of non-compliance substantially in the form set forth in Paragraph 3 of
the Draft Settlement Agreement shall be deemed to be a sufficient form of
release to satisfy the condition set forth in this Section 6.2(h), provided that
(x) (1) in the case of clause (i) above, such release is effective on the
Closing Date, and is not subject to any pre-Closing or post-Closing condition
(other than, if applicable, the making of any payment contemplated by the
penultimate sentence of this Section 6.2(h)) or (2) in the case of clause (ii)
above, the conditions set forth in clause (A), (B) and (C) have been satisfied
and (y) the Sellers have no reason to believe that either of the Sellers is in

representations and warranties of each of the Sellers contained in this
Agreement that are not qualified by Purchaser Material Adverse Effect shall be

if made anew at and as of that time (other than representations and warranties
made as of a specified date, which shall be true and correct as of that date),
except where all such failures to be true and correct, individually or in the
aggregate, do not constitute a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect.

as of or prior to the Closing shall have been duly performed in all material
respects.

          (c)  Purchaser shall have delivered to each of the Sellers a

contemplated hereby abandoned prior to the Closing as follows:

          (a)  by mutual written consent of the parties at any time;

          (b)  by written notice to the Sellers from Purchaser, if (i) there is
any material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on
the part of either Seller set forth in this Agreement, or if a representation or
warranty of either Seller shall be untrue in any material respect, in either
case, such that the condition specified in Section 6.2(a) or Section 6.2(b)
hereof would not be satisfied at the Closing (a "Terminating Seller Breach"),
except that, if such Terminating Seller Breach is curable by such Seller through
the exercise of its reasonable best efforts, then for so long as such
Terminating Seller Breach is curable and Seller continues to use its reasonable
best efforts to cure such Terminating Seller Breach (the "Seller Cure Period"),
such termination shall not be effective, and such termination shall become

Cure Period, provided, however, that Purchaser may not terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this clause (i) at any time during which Purchaser is in material

terms of a final, non-appealable order or judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction;

          (c)  by written notice to Purchaser from either of the Sellers, if (i)
there is any material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement on the part of Purchaser set forth in this Agreement, or if a
representation or warranty of Purchaser shall be untrue in any material respect,
in either case, such that the condition specified in Section 6.3(a) or Section
6.3(b) hereof would not be satisfied at the Closing (a "Terminating Purchaser
Breach"), except that, if such Terminating Purchaser Breach is curable by
Purchaser through the exercise of its reasonable best efforts, then, for so long
as such Terminating Parent Breach is curable and Purchaser continues to exercise
such reasonable best efforts to cure such Terminating Purchaser Breach (the
"Purchaser Cure Period"), such termination shall not be effective, and such
termination shall become effective only if the Terminating Purchaser Breach is
not cured within the Purchaser Cure Period, provided, however, that the Sellers
may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this clause (i) at any time during
which the Sellers are in material breach of this

                                       40

<PAGE>

Agreement, (ii) the Closing has not occurred on or before the Termination Date,

the Sellers or (iii) if consummation of any of the transactions contemplated
hereby is enjoined or prohibited by the terms of a final, non-appealable order
or judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction;

          (d) by either Purchaser or Parent, by written notice to the other
party, if (i) the Stockholders' Written Consent shall not have been obtained,

thereof) shall have been held and completed, (iii) Parent's stockholders shall
have voted at the Stockholders Meeting on a proposal to adopt this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (iv) this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall not have been adopted at the
Stockholders Meeting (and shall not have been adopted at any adjournment or
postponement thereof) by the requisite vote;

          (e) by Purchaser (before or after the Stockholders Meeting) by written
notice to the Sellers, if Parent's Board of Directors (i) fails to include in
the Proxy Materials (if prepared for the Stockholders Meeting) its
recommendation without adverse modification or qualification that stockholders
approve this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii)
withdraws or modifies in an adverse manner its approval or recommendation of
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or (iii)
approves or publicly recommends any Acquisition Proposal (other than the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement); or

          (f) by Parent, by written notice to Purchaser, at any time prior to
the Stockholders Meeting or Stockholders' Written Consent, if the Board of
Directors of Parent (i) receives a Superior Proposal and (ii) determines in good
faith that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are no longer in the
best interests of Parent's stockholders.

     7.2  Effect of Termination.

          (a) In the event of termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section
7.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, without any
liability on the part of any party hereto or their respective Affiliates,
officers, directors or stockholders in either case, other than (i) any liability
of the Sellers or Purchaser as the case may be, for breaches of this Agreement
occurring prior to such termination; provided, however, that in the event that
this Agreement is so terminated, neither party shall have any liability for any
breach or violation of this Agreement unless such breach or violation (other
than any breach or violation (x) by the Sellers of Section 4.2, which is subject
exclusively to Section 7.2(b), (y) by the Sellers of Section 5.7(a), which is
subject exclusively to Section 7.2(c), or (z) by Purchaser of Section 5.9(a),

Subsidiaries consummates or enters into a definitive agreement

                                       41

<PAGE>

to consummate such Acquisition Proposal (or a substantially identical
Acquisition Proposal with the same third party or an Affiliate thereof), (ii)
Purchaser pursuant to Section 7.1(e) and this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby shall not have been adopted at the Stockholders Meeting (and

documented, reasonable, out-of-pocket expenses reasonably incurred by Purchaser
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including,
without limitation, the financing thereof.

          (c) If (i) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to clause (ii) of
Section 7.1(b) or clause (ii) of Section 7.1(c), (ii) the condition set forth in

of clauses (i) and (ii) of Section 6.2(h), as applicable) and (iii) prior to
such termination, the conditions set forth in Sections 6.1, 6.2(g) and 6.3
(other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing and are capable of being satisfied) shall have been satisfied, then the
Sellers shall pay to Purchaser the amount of all documented, reasonable,
out-of-pocket expenses reasonably incurred by Purchaser in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, without limitation, the
financing thereof.

          (d) If (i) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to clause (ii) of
Section 7.1(b) or clause (ii) of Section 7.1(c) and (ii) prior to such
termination, the conditions set forth in Sections 6.1 and 6.2 (other than (x)
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing and are
capable of being satisfied and (y) the condition set forth in Section 6.2(g))
shall have been satisfied, then Purchaser shall take all actions necessary to
cause the Earnest Money Deposit to be released to Parent.

          (e) The provisions of this Section 7.2 and Articles 9 and 10 hereof
shall survive any termination of this Agreement.

                                   ARTICLE 8.
                                 INDEMNIFICATION

     8.1 Survival of Representations, Etc. The representations and warranties of
each party contained herein shall survive the Closing until the second
anniversary of the Closing Date provided, however, that (i) the representations
and warranties contained in Sections 2.1 and 2.3(b), the second sentence of
Section 2.6(a) and Section 3.1 shall survive indefinitely, (ii) the
representations and warranties in Section 2.17 shall survive until 30 days after

     8.2  Indemnification.

          (a) The Sellers shall, jointly and severally, indemnify and hold
Purchaser and its officers, directors, employees and Affiliates and their
respective successors and assigns (the "Purchaser Indemnified Parties") harmless
from any damage, claim, liability or expense, including, without limitation,
reasonable attorneys' fees (collectively "Damages"), arising out of or relating
to (i) the breach of any warranty, representation, covenant or agreement of the
Sellers contained in this Agreement or (ii) any Excluded Liability.

                                       42

<PAGE>

          (b) Purchaser shall indemnify and hold Parent, Opco and their
respective officers, directors, employees and Affiliates and their respective
successors and assigns (the "Seller Indemnified Parties") harmless from any
Damages, arising out of or relating to (i) the breach of any warranty,
representation, covenant or agreement of Purchaser contained in this Agreement
or (ii) except as set forth in Section 8.4, any Assumed Liability.

          (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) no Person shall be entitled to
indemnification for any Damages pursuant to clause (i) of either Section 8.2(a)
or Section 8.2(b) (collectively, the "Specified Damages") unless and until the
amount of all Specified Damages for which such Person is entitled to
indemnification exceeds $500,000 (the "Threshold Amount"), at which time such
Person shall be entitled to indemnification only for all such Specified Damages
sustained by such Person to the extent that the amount of such Specified Damages
(excluding attorneys' fees other than for third party claims) exceeds $250,000,
(ii) in no event shall the aggregate amount of Specified Damages for which
Purchaser Indemnified Parties or Seller Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to
indemnification exceed $12,500,000, (iii) the amount of Damages for which any
Person is entitled to indemnification shall be reduced by any insurance
recoveries or other indemnities, contributions or similar payments actually
recovered from any third party as a result of the incurrence of such Damages or
the facts or circumstances giving rise thereto, (iv) an Indemnitor may require
any Indemnified Party to assign to Indemnitor such Indemnified Party's rights to
seek recovery from any insurer or other indemnitor for Damages paid to
Indemnified Party by or on behalf of Indemnitor, (v) for purposes of determining
the amount of any Specified Damages relating to all representations or
warranties (but not for determining the inaccuracy thereof), all qualifications
or expectations contained therein relating to Business Material Adverse Effect
or Purchaser Material Adverse Effect (as applicable) shall be disregarded.

          (d) [Intentionally Omitted.]

          (e) Each party hereto agrees to take, and to cause its Affiliates to
take, all reasonable steps to mitigate any Damages incurred or to be incurred by
such party or its Affiliates upon and after becoming aware of any event which
could reasonably be expected to give rise to any Damages.

     8.3 Conduct of Proceedings. If any third party claim, action, suit or
proceeding (a "Proceeding") covered by the foregoing agreements to indemnify and
hold harmless shall arise, the party seeking indemnification pursuant to this
Article 8 (the "Indemnified Party") shall give written notice thereof to the
other party (the "Indemnitor") promptly, but in any event within ten days, after
the Indemnified Party learns of the existence of such Proceeding; provided,
however, that the Indemnified Party's failure to give the Indemnitor prompt
notice shall not release the Indemnitor except to the extent such party is
prejudiced by such failure. Such notice shall describe the claim in reasonable
detail and include copies of all related notices and documents (including court
papers) served on or received by the Indemnified Party. The Indemnitor shall
have the right to participate in such claim or action, to assume the defense
thereof with counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party, and to
compromise, settle or otherwise dispose of the same, if the Indemnitor deems it
advisable to do so, all at the expense of the Indemnitor; provided that,
Indemnitor shall not settle, or consent to entry of any judgment in any
Proceeding, without obtaining a release of the Indemnified Party from, or
acknowledging its obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party for, all Damages
in respect of the claims underlying such Proceeding. If requested by the
Indemnified Party, the Indemnitor shall assume the defense of

                                       43

<PAGE>

such claim, subject to the limitations set forth in this Section 8.3. After
notice to the Indemnified Party of the Indemnitor's election to assume the
defense of such claim or action, the Indemnitor shall not be liable to the
Indemnified Party for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the
Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof; provided that, in the
event that the Indemnified Party shall reasonably determine, based upon the
advice of its outside legal counsel, that (x) it may have available to it one or
more defenses or counterclaims that are inconsistent with one or more of those
that may be available to the Indemnitor in respect of such claim or any
litigation relating thereto, or (y) there is a conflict of interest between the
Indemnitor and the Indemnified Party, then the Indemnified Party shall have the
right at all times to have one counsel participate in the defense of such claim
at the expense of the Indemnitor. In such an event, the Indemnitor shall not
assume the defense of such Proceeding on behalf of the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnified Party shall assume its own defense and the Indemnitor shall pay the
reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel to the Indemnified Party. The
parties will fully cooperate in any such action, and shall make available to
each other any books or records useful for the defense of any such Proceeding.
If the Indemnitor fails to acknowledge in writing its obligation to defend
against or settle any Proceeding that it is obligated to defend hereunder within
thirty (30) days after receiving notice thereof from the Indemnified Party (or
such shorter time specified in the notice as the circumstances of the matter may
dictate), the Indemnified Party shall have the right to undertake the defense
and settlement of any such Proceeding, at the Indemnitor's expense; provided
that, if the Indemnified Party assumes the defense of any such Proceeding, the
Indemnified Party shall not settle such Proceeding prior to final judgment
thereon or forego any appeal with respect thereto without the prior written
consent of the Indemnitor (which consent may not be unreasonably withheld).

     8.4 Limited Environmental Indemnification. If, prior to the fifth
anniversary of the Closing Date, a Proceeding is initiated against Purchaser
with respect to the Transferred Real Property pursuant to any Environmental Law
in effect at that time that provides a right of contribution against the Sellers
as owner or operator of such Transferred Real Property and Purchaser provides
notice of such Proceeding to the Sellers within 30 days after such Proceeding is
initiated, Purchaser shall be entitled to seek contribution from the Sellers
pursuant to the contribution provisions of such Environmental Law in effect at
that time. Notwithstanding Purchaser's assumption of the Assumed Liabilities,
the Sellers will not be entitled to indemnification from Purchaser with respect
to Losses incurred by the Sellers as a result of the application of this Section
8.4. For the avoidance of doubt, subject only to this Section 8.4, all Losses
under Environmental Laws related to the Transferred Business or the Assets are
Assumed Liabilities, and Purchaser will be obligated to indemnify the Sellers
for such Losses under Section 8.2(b)(ii).

     8.5 Sole Remedy; Time Limitation. After the Closing has occurred, the right
to indemnification under this Article 8 shall be the exclusive remedy of each
party hereto in connection with any breach by the other party of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained herein.

                                   ARTICLE 9.
