                    CHANGE IN CONTROL AND SEVERANCE AGREEMENT
                    -----------------------------------------

     THIS AGREEMENT  dated as of __________,  ____, is made by and between Terex
Corporation,  a Delaware  corporation  (the "Company"),  and  ____________  (the
"Executive").

     WHEREAS the Company  considers it  essential  to the best  interests of its
stockholders to foster the continued employment of key management personnel; and

     WHEREAS the Board of  Directors  of the Company  (the  "Board")  recognizes
that, as is the case with many publicly-held corporations,  the possibility of a
Change in  Control  (as  defined in the  Section 18 below)  exists and that such
possibility, and the uncertainty which it may raise among management, may result
in the departure or distraction of management  personnel to the detriment of the
Company and its stockholders; and

     WHEREAS the Board has determined that appropriate  steps should be taken to
reinforce and encourage the continued attention and dedication of members of the
Company's management,  including the Executive, to their assigned duties without
distraction in the face of potentially disturbing circumstances arising from the
possibility of a Change in Control;

     NOW THEREFORE,  in  consideration  of the premises and the mutual covenants
herein contained, the Company and the Executive hereby agree as follows:

     1.  Defined  Terms.  The  definitions  of  capitalized  terms  used in this
Agreement are provided above and in Section 18 hereof.

     2. Term of Agreement.

          2.1.  (a) This  Agreement  shall  be  effective  immediately  upon its
     execution  by the  parties  hereto  and shall  remain  in effect  until the
     earliest of (i) the  termination  of the  Executive's  employment  with the
     Company  prior  to a  Change  in  Control  (other  than  a  termination  of
     Executive's  employment in  anticipation of a Change in Control) for any of
     the following:  by the Company for Cause, by Executive for any reason other
     than Good Reason or by reason of Executive's death or Permanent Disability;
     (ii) the termination of Executive's employment with the Company following a
     Change  in  Control  by  reason of death or  Permanent  Disability,  by the
     Company for Cause or by the  Executive for any reason other than for a Good
     Reason; or (iii) three (3) years after the date of a Change in Control.

                    (b)  Notwithstanding  Section  2.1(a) to the contrary,  this
               Agreement shall terminate _______, ____ if the Executive is still
               in the  employ of the  Company  and a Change in  Control  has not
               occurred and is not  reasonably  expected to occur within the six
               (6) month period thereafter.

                    (c) All  obligations  of the  Company  and/or the  Executive
               outstanding  on the  date of  termination  of this  Agreement  or
               resulting from the Executive's  employment termination during the

<PAGE>

               term of this  Agreement  shall  survive the  termination  of this
               Agreement.  All right and  obligations  of the Company and/or the
               Executive  in this Section 2(c) or in Sections 4, 9 or 12 of this
               Agreement shall also survive the termination of this Agreement.

     3. Change in Control.  If the  Executive's  employment  shall be terminated
within twenty-four (24) months following a Change in Control or concurrent with,
or in contemplation  of, a Change in Control,  unless such termination is (i) by
the  Company  for  Cause,  (ii) by  reason  of  Executive's  death or  Permanent
Disability, or (iii) by the Executive without Good Reason, the Company shall pay
to the  Executive  an amount equal to the sum of (a) a lump sum equal to two (2)
times  Executive's  annual  salary  in  effect  at the time  written  notice  of
termination is given; (b) two (2) times Executive's last paid annual bonus for a
calendar  year  preceding  the  calendar  year in which the Date of  Termination
occurs,  provided  that if Executive  has been  employed by the Company for less
than one year on the Date of  Termination  and has not yet  received a bonus for
the prior  calendar  year,  then  Executive  will be  entitled  to two (2) times
Executive's  target bonus; and (c) any accrued vacation pay, in each case to the
extent not  theretofore  paid (the sum of the amounts  described in clauses (a),
(b) and (c) shall be hereinafter  referred to as the  "Severance").  The Company
shall  pay  to  the   Executive  the  Severance  in  a  cash  lump  sum  payment
simultaneously  with the  termination of Executive's  employment as described in
this Section 3. In addition,  simultaneously with the termination of Executive's
employment  as described in this Section 3, (x) all unvested  stock  options and
stock  grants   previously   awarded  to   Executive   shall   immediately   and
unconditionally  vest and  Executive  shall have the right to exercise any stock
options  held by him in  accordance  with  their  terms  but in no  event  shall
Executive  have less than six (6) months  following the Date of  Termination  to
exercise  said  options;  (y) all units  granted to  Executive  pursuant  to the
Company's  1999 Long Term  Incentive  Compensation  Plan shall  immediately  and
unconditionally vest for their maximum cumulative value and be paid to Executive
simultaneously  with the  termination of employment as described in this Section
3; and (z) the Company shall provide  Executive with  continuing  coverage under
the life,  disability,  accident and health insurance  programs for employees of
the Company generally and under any supplemental programs covering executives of
the  Company,  as from time to time in effect,  for the  twenty  four (24) month
period  from  such   termination  or  until  Executive   becomes   eligible  for
substantially  similar  coverage  under  the  employee  welfare  plans  of a new
employer,  whichever occurs earlier,  provided that  Executive's  right to elect
continued medical coverage after termination of employment under Part 6 of Title
I of the Employee  Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended,  shall be
deemed  satisfied by the coverage  provided in this clause (z).  Executive shall
also be entitled to a  continuation  of all other benefits in effect at the time
of  termination  (including,  without  limitation,   automobile,  country  club,
vacation and pension  benefits,  if  applicable)  for the twenty four (24) month
period  following  such  termination  or until  Executive  becomes  eligible for
substantially similar benefits from a new employer.

     4. Excise Tax Gross-Up.

          4.1.  Notwithstanding  anything in this  Agreement to the contrary and
     except as set forth  below,  in the event it shall be  determined  that any
     payment or  distribution  by the  Company or its  affiliates  to or for the
     benefit  of the  Executive  (whether  paid or  payable  or  distributed  or
     distributable  pursuant to the terms of this  Agreement or  otherwise,  but
     determined  without regard to any additional  payments  required under this
     Section 4) (a  "Payment")  would be  subject  to the excise tax  imposed by

                                       2
<PAGE>

     Section 4999 of the Internal  Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code")
     or any interest or penalties are incurred by the Executive  with respect to
     such  excise tax (such  excise tax,  together  with any such  interest  and
     penalties,  are hereinafter  collectively referred to as the "Excise Tax"),
     then the Executive  shall be entitled to receive an  additional  payment (a
     "Gross-Up  Payment") in an amount such that after  payment by the Executive
     of all taxes  (including any interest or penalties  imposed with respect to
     such  taxes),  including,  without  limitation,  any income  taxes (and any
     interest and penalties imposed with respect thereto) and Excise Tax imposed
     upon the Gross-Up Payment,  the Executive retains an amount of the Gross-Up
     Payment equal to the Excise Tax imposed upon the Payments.  Notwithstanding
     the foregoing,  if it shall be determined that the Executive is entitled to
     a  Gross-Up  Payment,  but  that the  Payments  do not  exceed  105% of the
     greatest amount (the "Reduced  Amount") that could be paid to the Executive
     such that the  receipt of  Payments  would not give rise to any Excise Tax,
     then no Gross-Up  Payment  shall be made to the Executive and the Payments,
     in the aggregate, shall be reduced to the Reduced Amount.

          4.2.  Subject to the  provisions  of Section 4.3,  all  determinations
     required  to be made under this  Section 4,  including  whether  and when a
     Gross-Up  Payment is required and the amount of such  Gross-Up  Payment and
     the assumptions to be utilized in arriving at such determination,  shall be
     made by  PricewaterhouseCoopers  LLP or such  other  nationally  recognized
     certified public accounting firm as may be designated by the Executive (the
     "Accounting  Firm") which shall provide  detailed  supporting  calculations
     both to the Company and the Executive  simultaneously with any event giving
     rise to a Gross-Up  Payment.  All fees and expenses of the Accounting  Firm
     shall be borne solely by the Company.  Any Gross-Up Payment,  as determined
     pursuant to this  Section 4, shall be paid by the Company to the  Executive
     simultaneously  with any  event  giving  rise to a  Gross-Up  Payment.  Any
     determination  by the Accounting Firm shall be binding upon the Company and
     the Executive. As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section
     4999 of the Code at the time of the initial determination by the Accounting
     Firm hereunder,  it is possible that Gross-Up  Payments which will not have
     been made by the Company should have been made ("Underpayment"), consistent
     with the calculations required to be made hereunder.  In the event that the
     Company  exhausts  its remedies  pursuant to Section 4.3 and the  Executive
     thereafter is required to make a payment of any Excise Tax, the  Accounting
     Firm shall determine the amount of the  Underpayment  that has occurred and
     any such  Underpayment  shall be promptly paid by the Company to or for the
     benefit of the Executive.

          4.3. The Executive shall notify the Company in writing of any claim by
     the Internal Revenue Service that, if successful, would require the payment
     by  the  Company  of  the  Gross-Up  Payment  or  the  Underpayment.   Such
     notification  shall be given as soon as  practicable  but no later than ten
     (10) business days after the Executive is informed in writing of such claim
     and shall  apprise  the Company of the nature of such claim and the date on
     which such claim is requested to be paid. The Executive  shall not pay such
     claim prior to the  expiration of the thirty (30) day period  following the
     date on which it gives such notice to the Company (or such  shorter  period
     ending on the date that any payment of taxes with  respect to such claim is
     due).  If the  Company  notifies  the  Executive  in  writing  prior to the
     expiration  of such  period  that it  desires to contest  such  claim,  the
     Executive shall:

                                       3
<PAGE>

               (1) provide the Company any information  reasonably  requested by
          the Company relating to such claim,

               (2) take such action in connection  with contesting such claim as
          the Company  shall  reasonably  request in writing  from time to time,
          including,  without  limitation,  accepting legal  representation with
          respect  to such  claim  by an  attorney  reasonably  selected  by the
          Company,

               (3) cooperate with the Company in good faith in order effectively
          to contest such claim, and

               (4) permit the Company to participate in any proceedings relating
          to such claim;

          provided,  however,  that the Company  shall bear and pay directly all
     costs and expenses  (including  attorney's fees and additional interest and
     penalties) incurred in connection with such contest and shall indemnify and
     hold the Executive  harmless,  on an after-tax basis, for any Excise Tax or
     income tax  (including  attorney's  fees and  interest and  penalties  with
     respect thereto) imposed, including, but not limited to, those imposed as a
     result of such  representation  and payment of costs and expenses.  Without
     limitation  on the  foregoing  provisions  of this Section 4.3, the Company
     shall control all proceedings taken in connection with such contest and, at
     its sole option,  may pursue or forgo any and all  administrative  appeals,
     proceedings,  hearings and conferences with the taxing authority in respect
     of such claim and may, at its sole option,  either  direct the Executive to
     pay the tax  claimed  and sue for a  refund  or  contest  the  claim in any
     permissible manner, and the Executive agrees to prosecute such contest to a
     determination  before any  administrative  tribunal,  in a court of initial
     jurisdiction  and in one or more  appellate  courts,  as the Company  shall
     determine;  provided, however, that if the Company directs the Executive to
     pay such claim and sue for a refund,  the  Company  shall pay the amount of
     such payment to the Executive,  along with an additional  Gross-Up Payment,
     and shall indemnify and hold the Executive harmless, on an after-tax basis,
     from any Excise Tax or income tax (including  reasonable  attorney's  fees,
     interest or penalties with respect  thereto)  imposed,  including,  but not
     limited to,  those  imposed with respect to such payment or with respect to
     any imputed income with respect to such payment;  and further provided that
     any  extension of the statute of  limitations  relating to payment of taxes
     for the taxable year of the Executive  with respect to which such contested
     amount is  claimed to be due is limited  solely to such  contested  amount.
     Furthermore,  the  Company's  control  of the  contest  shall be limited to
     issues with respect to which a Gross-Up Payment would be payable  hereunder
     and the Executive  shall be entitled to settle or contest,  as the case may
     be, any other issue  raised by the  Internal  Revenue  Service or any other
     taxing authority.

          4.4. If, after the receipt by the Executive of an amount
advanced by the Company  pursuant to Section  4.3,  the  Executive  receives any
refund with respect to such claim, the Executive shall (subject to the Company's
complying with the  requirements of Section 4.3) promptly pay to the Company the
amount of such refund (together with any interest paid or credited thereon after
taxes applicable thereto).

                                       4

     5.  Termination  without  Cause  or  For  Good  Reason.  In the  event  the
Executive's  employment  with the Company is terminated  by the Company  without
Cause or by the Executive for Good Reason,  at any time, and, provided no Change
in Control shall have occurred,  the Company shall pay the  Executive,  in cash,
aggregate  severance  payments  equal to his then base  salary  for up to twelve
months (12) months from the Date of Termination or the date upon which Executive
obtains alternative  employment,  whichever is earlier. The Company shall pay to
the Executive such severance payments due hereunder in twelve (12) equal monthly
payments  on the first day of each  month  following  such  termination.  If the
Company  fails to make any such  payment due,  and such  failure  continues  for
thirty (30) days following notice of nonpayment by the Executive,  the Executive
may accelerate the payment of all of the remaining  payments.  In addition,  (a)
Executive  shall  have the  right  to  exercise  any  stock  options,  long-term
incentive  awards or other  similar  awards held by him in  accordance  with the
relevant plan documents or grant letter;  provided,  however,  in no event shall
Executive  have less than six (6) months  following the Date of  Termination  to
exercise such options or awards;  and (b) the Company  shall  provide  Executive
with  continuing  coverage  under  the life,  disability,  accident  and  health
insurance  programs  for  employees  of the  Company  generally  and  under  any
supplemental  programs covering  executives of the Company  (including,  without
limitation, participation in the Company's 401(K) retirement plan), as from time
to time in effect,  for the twelve (12) month  period from such  termination  or
until Executive  becomes eligible for  substantially  similar coverage under the
employee  plans of a new  employer,  whichever  occurs  earlier,  provided  that
Executive's  right to elect  continued  medical  coverage  after  termination of
employment  under Part 6 of Title I of the Employee  Retirement  Income Security
Act of 1974, as amended,  shall be deemed satisfied by the coverage  provided in
this clause (b). Executive shall also be entitled to a continuation of all other
benefits in effect at the time of termination  (including,  without  limitation,
automobile,  country club, vacation and pension benefits, if applicable) for the
twelve (12) month period following such  termination or until Executive  becomes
eligible for substantially similar benefits from a new employer.

     6. Payment for Past Service.  Notwithstanding  any other provisions of this
Agreement,  if the Executive's employment is terminated at any time, the Company
shall pay the Executive,  in cash, an aggregate  amount not less than the sum of
(a) Executive's  annual bonus for the most recently completed fiscal year to the
extent such bonus has not been paid to Executive,  which bonus shall not be less
than the annual  bonus paid to  Executive  during  the fiscal  year  immediately
preceding it, if any; (b) the product of (i) a fraction,  the numerator of which
is the  number  of  days  in  the  current  fiscal  year  through  the  Date  of
Termination,  and the  denominator of which is 365 and (ii) the annual bonus for
the fiscal year  preceding the Date of  Termination  that has most recently been
paid  to the  Executive;  (c)  any  accrued  vacation  pay,  to the  extent  not
theretofore  paid to Executive;  and (d) any other  amounts  earned by Executive
prior to the Date of Termination but not previously paid.

     7. Noncompete and Confidentiality.

          7.1. In  consideration  of the  agreements and payments of the Company
     herein,  the Executive  agrees that for a period of twelve (12) months from
     the  Date  of  Termination,  unless  the  Date  of  Termination  is  within
     twenty-four (24) months  following a Change in Control,  in which event the

                                       5
<PAGE>

     Executive agrees that for a period of twenty-four (24) months from the Date
     of Termination,  he will not,  without the prior written  permission of the
     Company, directly or indirectly, (i) enter into the employ of or render any
     services to any person,  firm, or corporation engaged in the manufacture or
     sale of products currently  manufactured or distributed by the Company,  or
     if Executive does not have Company wide  responsibility,  the divisions and
     subsidiaries  for which  Executive  has  management  responsibility,  which
     directly or  indirectly  compete  with the  business of the Company or such
     divisions and subsidiaries,  as the case may be (a "Competitive  Business")
     (unless such person,  firm or  corporation  conducts at least some business
     which does not  constitute a  Competitive  Business and Executive is solely
     employed  by,  or  renders  services  to  business(es)  that is (are) not a
     Competitive Business);  (ii) engage in any Competitive Business for his own
     account;  (iii) become  associated  with or interested  in any  Competitive
     Business  as  an  individual,  partner,  shareholder,  creditor,  director,
     officer, principal, agent, employee, trustee, consultant, advisor or in any
     other  relationship  or capacity  (unless such business,  person or company
     conducts at least some  business  which does not  constitute a  Competitive
     Business  and  Executive  is  solely   associated  with  or  interested  in
     business(es) which is (are) not a Competitive  Business);  or (iv) solicit,
     induce or entice, or cause any other person or entity to solicit, induce or
     entice to leave the employ of the  Company  any person who was  employed or
     retained by the  Company on the Date of  Termination.  However,  nothing in
     this Agreement shall preclude  Executive from investing his personal assets
     in the  securities of any  corporation  or other  business  entity which is
     engaged  in a  business  competitive  with  that  of the  Company  if  such
     securities   are  traded  on  a   national   stock   exchange   or  in  the
     over-the-counter  market  and if such  investment  does not  result  in his
     beneficially  owning,  at any  time,  more than  five  percent  (5%) of the
     publicly-traded  equity  securities  of such  competitor.  Nothing  in this
     Agreement   shall  preclude   Executive  from  retaining  his  position  or
     membership  in  trade  associations  and  professional  organizations.  The
     restrictions  imposed  on  Executive  pursuant  to this  Section  7.1 shall
     terminate and be of no further force and effect in the event of a breach by
     the Company of its obligations to make or provide benefits to Executive.

          7.2. In  consideration  of the  agreements and payments of the Company
     herein,  the  Executive  shall keep  confidential  and not  disclose to any
     person any information  relating to the Company's business and/or finances,
     which  information  was  obtained  during  and/or  as  incident  to  or  in
     connection  with the  Executive's  employment  with the  Company  and which
     otherwise is not public  information  or as required by law. The  Executive
     agrees he will conduct  himself in a  professional  manner and not make any
     disparaging,  negative  or other  statements  regarding  the  Company,  its
     affiliates or any of the officers, directors or employees of the Company or
     its  affiliates  which  could  in any way  have an  adverse  affect  on the
     business  or  affairs of the  Company or its  affiliates  or  otherwise  be
     injurious to or not be in the best interests of the Company, its affiliates
     or any such other persons.

          7.3   The   Executive   agrees   that   this    non-competition    and
     non-solicitation  covenant is reasonable under the  circumstances,  and the
     Executive further agrees that his services for and on behalf of the Company
     are unique and irreplaceable.  The Executive further agrees that any breach
     of the covenants  contained in Section 7.1 and 7.2 above would  irreparably
     injure the Company and/or its affiliates or subsidiaries.  Accordingly, the
     Executive  agrees that the Company  may, in addition to pursuing  any other
     remedies it may have at law or in equity,  obtain an injunction against the
     Executive from any court having  jurisdiction  over the matter  restraining
     any further  violation  of the  covenants  contained in Section 7.1 and 7.2
     above.

                                       6
<PAGE>

          7.4. Upon termination of Executive's  employment with the Company, the
     Company  shall  have the  right to  designate  a  reasonable  amount of the
     Severance   to  be   allocated   to  this   covenant  not  to  compete  and
     confidentiality.

     8.  Outplacement   Services.  In  the  event  of  the  termination  of  the
Executive's  employment  after a Change in Control or without  Cause or for Good
Reason  at any time as  provided  for in  Sections  3 or 5 hereof,  the  Company
agrees, at its sole cost and expense, to provide the Executive with outplacement
services  for a period of at least  twelve  (12)  months  following  the Date of
Termination. The Company and the Executive shall use their good faith efforts to
locate a provider providing outplacement services,  which provider is reasonably
acceptable to both parties  taking into account the status of the Executive as a
senior executive officer.

     9. Legal Expenses.  The Company agrees to pay the reasonable  out-of pocket
legal  expenses  actually  incurred  by the  Executive  in  connection  with the
negotiation  and  execution  of this  Agreement.  The Company  agrees to pay all
reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses, including all reasonable attorneys'
fees and  disbursements,  actually  incurred by the  Executive in  collecting or
enforcing  payments  to  which  he is  successfully  determined  to be  entitled
(whether by agreement among the parties,  court order or otherwise)  pursuant to
this Agreement in accordance with its terms.

     10. Notice of  Termination.  Any purported  termination of the  Executive's
employment  (other  than by reason of death)  shall be  communicated  by written
notice  from one party  hereto  to the other  party  hereto in  accordance  with
Section 13 hereof. For purposes of this Agreement, a notice of termination shall
set forth in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances  claimed to provide a
basis for termination of the Executive's employment.

     11. No Other Compensation; Employee at Will. Except as provided in Sections
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 and 14 hereof,  no amount or benefit shall be payable to the
Executive  under this  Agreement  or otherwise  except as required by law.  This
Agreement  shall not be construed as creating an express or implied  contract of
employment and, except as otherwise  agreed in writing between the Executive and
the Company,  the  Executive is and shall remain "an employee at will" and shall
not have any right to be retained in the employ of the Company.

     12. Successors; Binding Agreement.

          12.1. In addition to any obligations imposed by law upon any successor
     to the Company,  the Company will require any successor  (whether direct or
     indirect,  by  purchase,  merger,  consolidation  or  otherwise)  to all or
     substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company to expressly
     assume and agree to perform  this  Agreement  in the same manner and to the
     same  extent  that the  Company  would be required to perform it if no such
     succession  had  taken  place.  Failure  of  the  Company  to  obtain  such
     assumption and agreement prior to the  effectiveness of any such succession
     shall be a breach of this  Agreement  and shall  entitle the  Executive  to
     compensation  from the  Company in the same amount and on the same terms as

                                       7

     the  Executive  would be entitled to  hereunder  if the  Executive  were to
     terminate  the  Executive's  employment  for Good Reason  after a Change in
     Control, except that, for purposes of implementing the foregoing,  the date
     on which any such succession  becomes effective shall be deemed the Date of

     by  the   Executive's   personal  or  legal   representatives,   executors,
     administrators,  successors, heirs, distributees, devisees and legatees. If
     the  Executive  shall die while any  amount  would  still be payable to the
     Executive  hereunder  (other than amounts which, by their terms,  terminate
     upon the death of the  Executive)  if the  Executive had continued to live,
     all  such  amounts,  unless  otherwise  provided  herein,  shall be paid in
     accordance  with the terms of this  Agreement  to the  executors,  personal
     representatives or administrators of the Executive's estate.

          To the Executive: _________________


     14. Miscellaneous.  No provision of this Agreement may be modified,  waived
or  discharged  unless such  waiver,  modification  or discharge is agreed to in
writing  and signed by the  Executive  and such  officer as may be  specifically
designated  by the Board.  No waiver by either  party  hereto at any time of any
breach by the other  party  hereto of, or  compliance  with,  any  condition  or
provision of this  Agreement to be performed by such other party shall be deemed
a waiver of similar or dissimilar provisions or conditions at the same or at any
prior or subsequent time. No agreements or  representations,  oral or otherwise,
express or implied,  with respect to the subject matter hereof have been made by
either party which are not expressly set forth in this Agreement.  The validity,
interpretation, construction and performance of this Agreement shall be governed
by the laws of the State of  Connecticut.  All  references  to  sections  of the
Exchange  Act or the  Code  shall  be  deemed  also to  refer  to any  successor
provisions to such sections.  Any payments  provided for hereunder shall be paid
net of any applicable withholding required under federal, state or local law and
any additional withholding to which the Executive has agreed.

     15. Partial Validity.  The invalidity or  unenforceability or any provision
of this Agreement shall not affect the validity or  enforceability  of any other
provision of this Agreement,  which shall remain in full force and effect,  and,

                                       8
<PAGE>

specifically,  the  invalidity or  unenforceability  of any of the provisions of
Paragraph 7 shall not affect,  alter or otherwise  abrogate any of the Company's
payment obligations pursuant to this Agreement.

     16. Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed in several  counterparts,
each of which shall be deemed to be an original but all of which  together  will
constitute one and the same instrument.

     17. Mitigation.  The Company agrees that if Executive's employment with the
Company  terminates  Executive  is not required to seek other  employment  or to
attempt  in any  way to  reduce  any  amounts  payable  to him  due  under  this
Agreement.  Further,  the  amount of any  payment  shall not be  reduced  by any
compensation  earned  by  Executive  as the  result  of  employment  by  another
employer,  by retirement  benefits,  by offset  against any amount claimed to be
owed by Executive to the Company, or otherwise.

     18. Definitions.  For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms shall
have the meanings indicated below:

          (a)  "Beneficial  Owner" shall have the meaning  defined in Rule 13d-3
     under the Exchange Act.

          (b)  "Cause"  for  termination  by  the  Company  of  the  Executive's
     employment  shall  mean  (i) the  continued  failure  by the  Executive  to
     substantially  perform the Executive's  duties with the Company (other than
     any such failure resulting from the Executive's  incapacity due to physical
     or  mental  illness)  in a  manner  reasonably  satisfactory  to the  Chief
     Executive Officer of the Company after written notice detailing the reasons
     for such  failure,  (ii) the willful  engaging by the  Executive in conduct
     which is  demonstrably  and  materially  injurious  to the  Company  or its
     subsidiaries,  monetarily or otherwise  after  written  notice to Executive
     detailing  such  conduct  and  injury,  or  (iii)  the  entry by a court of
     competent  jurisdiction  of an order, or the entering into by the Executive
     of a consent  decree,  barring the Executive  from serving as an officer or
     director of a public company.  For purposes of clauses (i) and (ii) of this
     definition,  no act,  or failure to act, on the  Executive's  part shall be
     deemed  "willful"  unless done, or omitted to be done, by the Executive not
     in good faith and without  reasonable  belief that the Executive's  act, or
     failure to act, was in the best interest of the Company.

          (c) A "Change  in  Control"  shall be deemed to have  occurred  if the
     conditions set forth in any one of the following paragraphs shall have been
     satisfied:

          directly  from the Company)  representing  35% or more of the combined
          voting power of the Company's then outstanding  securities,  excluding
          any person who becomes  such a  Beneficial  Owner in  connection  with
          transactions  described in clauses (x), (y) or (z) of paragraph  (iii)

               (ii)  there  is a  change  in the  composition  of the  Board  of
          Directors of the Company  occurring  within a rolling two-year period,
          as a result  of which  fewer  than a  majority  of the  directors  are

          Board); or

               (iii)  there is  consummated,  in any  transaction  or  series of
          transactions,  of a complete liquidation or dissolution of the Company
          or a merger,  consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of the
          Company's assets (collectively, a "Business Combination") other than a
          Business  Combination  after which (x) the stockholders of the Company
          own more than 50 percent of the common stock or combined  voting power
          of the voting  securities of the Company  resulting  from the Business
          Combination,  (y) at least a majority of the board of directors of the
          resulting  corporation were Incumbent Directors and (z) no individual,
          entity or group (excluding any corporation resulting from the Business
          Combination or any employee benefit plan of such corporation or of the
          Company)  becomes  the  Beneficial  Owner of 35 percent or more of the
          combined voting power of the securities of the resulting  corporation,
          who  did not own  such  securities  immediately  before  the  Business
          Combination; or

               (iv) the  stockholders  of the Company approve a plan of complete
          liquidation  or  dissolution  of the Company or there is consummated a
          sale or  disposition  by the Company of all or  substantially  all the
          Company's assets.

          (d) "Date of Termination,"  with respect to any purported  termination
     of the Executive's employment shall mean the later of (i) date specified in
     the notice or (ii) thirty (30) days from the date of the notice unless such
     notice is for a termination of Executive for Cause.

          (e) "Exchange Act" shall mean the Securities  Exchange Act of 1934, as
     amended from time to time.

          (f) "Good Reason" for  termination by the Executive of the Executive's
     employment  shall mean the  occurrence  (without  the  Executive's  express
     written  consent)  of any  one of the  following  acts by the  Company,  or
     failures by the Company to act,  unless,  in the case of any act or failure
     to act as described below, such act or failure to act is corrected prior to
     the Date of  Termination  specified in the notice of  termination  given in
     respect thereof:

                                       10
<PAGE>

               (i) the  assignment to the  Executive of any duties  inconsistent
          with the  Executive's  status  as a senior  executive  officer  of the
          Company  or  a  substantial   adverse  alteration  in  the  nature  of
          Executive's authority, duties or responsibilities, or any other action
          by  the  Company  which  results  in  a  diminution  in  such  status,
          authority, duties or responsibilities (it being understood that a mere
          change in authority,  duties or responsibilities,  or any other action
          by the Company will not constitute Good Reason in and of itself unless
          it  results in a  substantial  adverse  alteration  or  diminution  of
          Executive's authority, duties or responsibilities), excluding for this
          purpose an isolated, insubstantial and inadvertent action not taken in
          bad faith and which is remedied by the Company  promptly after receipt
          of notice thereof given by the Executive;

               (ii) a reduction by the Company in Executive's base salary and/or
          annual  bonus as in  effect  on the date  hereof or as the same may be
          increased from time to time,  except for  across-the-board  reductions
          similarly  affecting (i.e., all by the same percentage or Executive by
          a lesser  percentage  than each of the rest) all senior  executives of
          the Company or  reductions  for Cause,  provided,  however,  that such
          reductions  are not made as a result  of,  or in  contemplation  of, a
          Change in Control;

               (iii) the failure by the Company to pay to Executive  any portion
          of  Executive's  then  current  compensation  except  pursuant  to  an
          across-the-board  compensation deferral similarly affecting (i.e., all
          by the same  percentage or Executive by a lesser  percentage than each
          of the rest) all senior executives of the Company, provided,  however,
          that such  across-the-board  compensation  deferrals are not made as a
          result of, or in contemplation of, a Change in Control;

               (iv) the  failure  by the  Company  to  continue  in  effect  any
          compensation  plan or other  benefit in which  Executive  participates
          which is material to Executive's total  compensation,  except pursuant
          to an  across-the-board  compensation or benefit deferral or reduction
          similarly  affecting (i.e., all by the same percentage or Executive by
          a lesser  percentage  than each of the rest) all senior  executives of
          the Company or a deferral or reduction of  compensation or benefit for
          Cause, provided,  however, that such compensation or benefit deferrals
          and reductions are not made as a result of, or in contemplation  of, a
          Change in Control;

               (v) the failure by the  Company to continue to provide  Executive
          with benefits  substantially similar to those enjoyed by the Executive
          under any of the Company's pension,  life insurance,  medical,  health
          and accident,  disability plans or other benefits (including,  without
          limitation,  automobile, country club, vacation, and pension benefits)
          in which  Executive was  participating  at the time, the taking of any
          action by the Company which would  directly or  indirectly  materially
          reduce any of such  benefits or deprive the  Executive of any material

                                       11
<PAGE>

          fringe benefit enjoyed by Executive at the time,  (including,  without
          limitation,  automobile, country club, vacation and pension benefits),
          or the failure by the Company to provide  Executive with the number of
          paid vacation days to which Executive he is then entitled,  except for
          a deferral or reduction  of benefits  similarly  affecting  all senior
          executives  of the Company or a deferral or  reduction of benefits for
          Cause,  provided,  however, that such benefit deferrals and reductions
          are not made as a  result  of,  or in  contemplation  of, a Change  in
          Control; or

               (vi) the relocation of the Company's  principal executive offices
          to a location  more than 50 miles from the location of such offices on
          the date of this  Agreement  or a  requirement  that the  Executive be
          based anywhere other than at the Company's principal executive offices
          except for  necessary  travel on the  Company's  business to an extent
          substantially   consistent  with  the   Executive's   business  travel
          obligations on the date of this Agreement.

          (g)  "Permanent  Disability"  shall  be  deemed  the  reason  for  the
     termination by the Company of the Executive's employment if, as a result of
     the Executive's incapacity due to physical or mental illness, the Executive
     shall have been absent from the full-time  performance  of the  Executive's
     duties with the Company for a period of six (6) consecutive  months or nine
     (9) months out of any twelve  (12) month  period,  the  Company  shall have
     given the Executive a notice of termination  for  disability,  and,  within
     thirty (30) days after such notice of termination  is given,  the Executive
     shall not have returned to the  full-time  performance  of the  Executive's
     duties.

     IN WITNESS  WHEREOF,  the parties hereto have executed this Agreement as of
the date first above written.
