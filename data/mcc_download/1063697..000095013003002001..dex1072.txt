(including Article 3 and clause (g) below), on the Closing Date each initial
Primary Purchaser may purchase its Purchaser Percentage of the Equipment Loan
Initial Advance or the Receivables Initial Advance, as applicable, for a
purchase price equal to the portion of the Equipment Loan Initial Advance or the

whether an initial Primary Purchaser will make such purchase may, less such
amounts as the Issuer and the initial Primary Purchasers shall agree, be made by

          (b) On and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement
(including Article 3 and clause (g) below) and prior to the Conversion Date,
each Primary Purchaser may purchase its Purchaser Percentage of any Equipment

Increase or the Receivables Advance Increase, as applicable, so purchased. The
determination of whether an initial Primary Purchaser will make such purchase

          (c) Each purchase of any Equipment Loan Advance Increase or

Purchase Date if such CP Conduit has not elected to purchase its entire
Purchaser Percentage of the Equipment Loan Initial Advance, the Equipment Loan
Advance Increase, the Receivables Initial Advance, or the Receivables Advance
Increase, as the case may be, which notice shall specify (i) the identity of
such CP Conduit, (ii) the portion of the Equipment Loan Initial Advance, the

determined by such Agent in good faith; for purposes of such determination, such
Agent shall be entitled to rely conclusively on the most recent information
provided by such CP Conduit or its agent or by the agent for its Support
Parties). Subject to receiving such notice and the satisfaction of the
applicable conditions set forth in Article 3 and clause (g) below, each of such
CP Conduit's CPC Committed Purchasers shall make a purchase of Equipment Loan
Notes or Receivables Notes, as applicable, on the applicable Purchase Date in an
amount equal to its Liquidity Percentage of the portion of the Equipment Loan
Initial Advance, the Equipment Loan Advance Increase, the Receivables Initial
Advance, or the Receivables Advance Increase, as the case may be, which such CP
Conduit has not elected to purchase, for a purchase price equal to its share of
the Equipment Loan Initial Advance, the Equipment Loan Advance Increase, the
Receivables Initial Advance, or the Receivables Advance Increase, as applicable,
so purchased.

          (e) All purchases made pursuant to this Note Purchase Agreement by

Group or, if requested by such Agent, in the name of the relevant Primary
Purchaser. Each Equipment Loan Note Purchaser's or Receivables Note Purchaser's,
as applicable, purchase price payable pursuant to subsection 2.1(a), 2.1(b) or
2.1(d) shall be made available to the Issuer at such account as it shall direct
or to the Agent for its Purchaser Group at the account of the Agent specified in

forth in Article 3, if to the Agent, at or prior to 2:00 p.m., New York City
time, and if to the Issuer, at or prior to 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the
applicable Purchase Date, by deposit of immediately available funds. If such
funds are to be remitted to an Agent, such Agent shall promptly notify the
Issuer and the Transferor in the event that any Equipment Loan Note Purchaser or
Receivables Note Purchaser either fails to make such funds available to such
Agent before such time or notifies such Agent that it will not make such funds
available to such Agent before such time. Subject to (i) such Agent's receipt of
such funds and (ii) the fulfillment of the applicable conditions set forth in
Article 3, as determined by such Agent, such Agent will, not later than 3:00
p.m., New York City time on such Purchase Date, make such funds available, in
the same type of funds received, by wire transfer thereof to the account of the
Issuer in the United States specified in the applicable Advance Increase Notice
or, in the case of the purchase on the Closing Date, specified in writing by the
Issuer to such Agent not later than the one Business Day prior to the Closing
Date.

          (f) Notwithstanding the fulfillment of the applicable conditions set
forth in Article 3 with respect to a purchase, in the event that a CP Conduit
elected to make a purchase on a Purchase Date but failed to make its purchase
price available to the Agent for its Purchaser Group when required by subsection
2.1(e), such CP Conduit shall be deemed to have rescinded

                                      -12-

<PAGE>

its election to make such purchase, and none of the Issuer, the Transferor or
any other Person shall have any claim against such CP Conduit by reason of its
failure to timely make such purchase. In any such case, such Agent shall give
notice of such failure not later than 1:00 p.m., New York City time, on the
Purchase Date to each CPC Committed Purchaser for such CP Conduit and to the
Issuer and the Transferor, which notice shall specify (i) the identity of such
CP Conduit, (ii) the amount of the purchase which it had elected but failed to
make and (iii) the respective Liquidity Percentages of such CPC Committed
Purchasers on such Purchase Date (as determined by such Agent in good faith; for
purposes of such determination, such Agent shall be entitled to rely
conclusively on the most recent information provided by such CP Conduit or its
agent or by the agent for its Support Parties). Subject to receiving such
notice, each of such CP Conduit's CPC Committed Purchasers shall purchase a
portion of the Equipment Loan Note Principal Balance or Receivables Note
Principal Balance, as applicable, in an amount equal to its Liquidity Percentage
of the amount described in clause (ii) above at or before 2:00 p.m., New York
City time, on such Purchase Date and otherwise in accordance with subsection
2.1(d). Subject to such Agent's receipt of such funds, such Agent will not later
than 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on such Purchase Date make such funds
available, in the same type of funds received, by wire transfer thereof to the
account of the Issuer described in subsection 2.1(e), which payment shall be
deemed to be timely for purposes hereof and of the Indenture.

          (g) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no event (i)
shall a Committed Purchaser be required on any date to make a purchase of the
Equipment Loan Initial Advance or purchase an Equipment Loan Advance Increase
which would result in its Percentage Interest of the Equipment Loan Note
Principal Balance, determined after giving effect to such purchase, exceeding
its Adjusted Commitment with respect thereto; or (ii) may any Equipment Loan
Advance Increase or the Equipment Loan Initial Advance be offered for purchase
hereunder, nor shall any Equipment Loan Note Purchaser be obligated to purchase
any Equipment Loan Advance Increase or the Equipment Loan Initial Advance, to
the extent that, after giving effect to such Equipment Loan Advance Increase or
purchase of the Equipment Loan Initial Advance, the Equipment Loan Note
Principal Balance would exceed the Equipment Loan Facility Limit.

the Receivables Initial Advance be offered for purchase hereunder, nor shall any
Receivables Note Purchaser be obligated to purchase any Receivables Advance
Increase or the Receivables Initial Advance, to the extent that, after giving

Person controlling such Note Purchaser or Affected Party as a consequence of its
obligations hereunder or with respect hereto or its maintenance of its
Commitment or its interest in the Equipment Loan Notes or Receivables Notes, as
applicable, to a level below that which such Note Purchaser, Affected Party or

respect to capital adequacy) or such accounting change by an amount in good
faith deemed by such Note Purchaser, Affected Party or Person to be material,
then, from time to time, after submission by such Note Purchaser or Affected

from the following Distribution Date, until payment in full thereof (after as
well as before judgment) at the Federal Funds Rate in effect from time to time.
Nothing in this subsection 2.3(b) shall be deemed to require the Issuer or the
Servicer to pay any amount to a Note Purchaser or Affected Party to the extent
such Note Purchaser or Affected Party has been compensated therefor under
another provision of this Agreement or to the extent such amount is already
reflected in the applicable interest rate (other than with respect to the
applicable margin).

          (c) Each Note Purchaser and Affected Party agrees that it shall use
its reasonable efforts to reduce or eliminate any claim for compensation
pursuant to subsections 2.3(a) and 2.3(b), including but not limited to
designating a different Investing Office for their Equipment Loan Notes or
Receivables Notes, as applicable (or any interest therein), if such efforts will
avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, any increased amounts referred to
in subsection 2.3(a) or 2.3(b) and will not, in the reasonable opinion of such
Note Purchaser or Affected Party, as applicable, be unlawful or otherwise
disadvantageous to such Note Purchaser or Affected Party or inconsistent with
its policies or regulatory restrictions or result in any unreimbursed cost or
expense to such Note Purchaser or Affected Party or in an increase in the
aggregate amount payable under subsections 2.3(a) and 2.3(b).

<PAGE>

          (d) Each Note Purchaser or Affected Party claiming increased amounts
described in subsection 2.3(a) or 2.3(b) will furnish to the Agent for the
related Purchaser Group (together with its request for compensation) a
certificate prepared in good faith setting forth the basis (which may include
the use of estimates derived using commercially reasonable methods) and the
calculation of the amount (in reasonable detail) of each request by such Note
Purchaser or Affected Party for any such increased amounts referred to in
subsection 2.3(a) or 2.3(b). Any such certificate shall be conclusive absent
manifest error, and such Agent shall deliver a copy thereof to the Issuer, the
Transferor and the Servicer. Failure on the part of any Note Purchaser or
Affected Party to demand compensation for any amount pursuant to subsection
2.3(a) or 2.3(b) with respect to any period shall not constitute a waiver of
such Note Purchaser's or Affected Party's right to demand compensation with
respect to such period; provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing
provisions of this Section 2.3, a Note Purchaser or Affected Party, as
applicable, shall not be compensated for any such amount relating to any period
ending more than six months prior to the date that the related Agent for such
Note Purchaser or Affected Party notifies the Issuer, the Transferor and the
Servicer in writing thereof or for any amounts resulting from a change by any
Note Purchaser or Affected Party of its Investing Office (other than changes
required by law or changes made pursuant to subsection 2.3(c) or subsection
2.4(d)). Amounts owing under this Section 2.3 by the Issuer shall be due and
payable in accordance with Section 8.2 of the Indenture.

          2.4 Taxes.

          (a) All payments made to a Note Purchaser, an Affected Party, the
Agents or a Co-Administrative Agent under this Agreement and the Indenture
(including all amounts payable with respect to the Equipment Loan Notes or
Receivables Notes, as applicable) shall, to the extent allowed by law, be made
free and clear of, and without deduction or withholding for or on account of,
any present or future income, stamp, excise, franchise or other taxes, levies,
imposts, duties, charges, fees, deductions or withholdings, now or hereafter
imposed, levied, collected, withheld or assessed by any Governmental Authority
(collectively, "Taxes"), excluding (i) income taxes (including branch profit
taxes, minimum taxes and taxes computed under alternative methods, at least one
of which is based on or measured by net income), franchise taxes (imposed in
lieu of income taxes), or any other taxes based on or measured by the net income
of such Note Purchaser, Affected Party, Participant, Agent or Co-Administrative
Agent (as the case may be) or the gross receipts or income of such Note
Purchaser, Affected Party, Participant, Agent or Co-Administrative Agent, as the
case may be; (ii) any Taxes that would not have been imposed but for the failure
of such Note Purchaser, Affected Party, Participant, Agent or Co-Administrative
Agent, as applicable, to provide and keep current (to the extent legally able)
any certification or other documentation required to qualify for an exemption
from, or reduced rate of, any such Taxes or required by this Agreement to be
furnished by such Note Purchaser, Affected Party, Participant, Agent or
Co-Administrative Agent, as applicable; and (iii) any Taxes imposed as a result
of a change by any Note Purchaser, Affected Party or Participant of its
Investing Office (other than changes pursuant to this Agreement, including
subsection 2.4(c), or required by law) (all such excluded taxes being
hereinafter called "Excluded Taxes"). If, as a result of any change in law,
treaty or regulation or in the interpretation or administration thereof by any
governmental or regulatory agency or body charged with the administration or
interpretation thereof, or the adoption of any law, treaty or regulation, any
Taxes, other than Excluded Taxes, are required to be withheld from any amounts

                                      -17-

<PAGE>

payable to a Note Purchaser, Affected Party, Agent or Co-Administrative Agent
hereunder or under the Indenture, then after submission by any Note Purchaser or
Affected Party to the Agent for the related Purchaser Group and by any Agent or
Co-Administrative Agent to the Issuer, the Transferor and the Servicer of a
written request therefor, together with the certificate described in subsection
2.4(b) below, the amounts so payable to such Note Purchaser, Affected Party,
Agent or Co-Administrative Agent, as applicable, shall be increased by the
Issuer, and the Servicer shall pay to the applicable Agent for the account of
such Note Purchaser or Affected Party or for its own account or to a
Co-Administrative Agent, as applicable, the amount of such increase to the
extent necessary to yield to such Note Purchaser, Affected Party, Agent or
Co-Administrative Agent, as applicable (after payment of all such Taxes)
interest or any such other amounts payable hereunder or thereunder at the rates
or in the amounts specified in this Agreement and the Indenture; provided,
however, that the amounts so payable to such Note Purchaser, Affected Party,
Agent or Co-Administrative Agent shall not be increased pursuant to this
subsection 2.4(a) if such requirement to withhold results from the failure of
such Person to comply with subsection 2.4(c); and provided further, however,
that the Servicer shall not be required to pay any such additional amounts (or
any related interest or penalties) to the extent arising from the result of and
attributable to the failure of a Note Purchaser, Affected Party, Agent or
Co-Administrative Agent to file in a timely manner any tax returns required to
be filed by such Note Purchaser, Affected Party, Agent or Co-Administrative
Agent, as applicable, necessary to ensure that the net amount actually received
by such Person will equal the full amount such Person would have received had no
such deduction or withholding been required. Whenever any Taxes are payable on
or with respect to amounts distributed to a Note Purchaser, Affected Party,
Agent or Co-Administrative Agent, as promptly as possible thereafter the
Servicer shall send to the Agent, on behalf of such Note Purchaser or Affected
Party, or to such Agent or Co-Administrative Agent, as applicable, a certified
copy of an original official receipt showing payment thereof. If either the
Issuer or Servicer fails to pay any Taxes when due to the appropriate taxing
authority or fails to remit to the Agent, on behalf of itself or such Note
Purchaser or Affected Party, or to such Agent or Co-Administrative Agent, as
applicable, the required receipts or other required documentary evidence, the
Servicer shall pay to such Agent on behalf of such Note Purchaser or Affected
Party or to such Agent or Co-Administrative Agent for its own account, as
applicable, any incremental taxes, interest or penalties that may become payable
by such Note Purchaser, Affected Party, Agent or Co-Administrative Agent, as
applicable, as a result of any such failure.

          (b) A Note Purchaser or Affected Party claiming increased amounts
under subsection 2.4(a) for Taxes paid or payable by such Note Purchaser or
Affected Party will furnish to the applicable Agent a certificate prepared in
good faith setting forth the basis (which may include the use of estimates
derived using commercially reasonable methods) and amount of each request by
such Note Purchaser or Affected Party for such Taxes, and such Agent shall
deliver a copy thereof to the Issuer, the Transferor and the Servicer. An Agent
or a Co-Administrative Agent claiming increased amounts under subsection 2.4(a)
for its own account for Taxes paid or payable by such Agent or such
Co-Administrative Agent, as applicable, will furnish to the Issuer, the
Transferor and the Servicer a certificate prepared in good faith setting forth
the basis (which may include the use of estimates derived using commercially
reasonable methods) and amount of each request by such Agent or such
Co-Administrative Agent for such Taxes. Any such certificate of a Note
Purchaser, Affected Party, Agent or Co-Administrative Agent shall be conclusive
absent manifest error. Failure on the part of any Note Purchaser,

                                      -18-

<PAGE>

Affected Party, Agent or Co-Administrative Agent to demand additional amounts
pursuant to subsection 2.4(a) with respect to any period shall not constitute a
waiver of the right of such Note Purchaser, Affected Party, Agent or
Co-Administrative Agent, as the case may be, to demand compensation with respect
to such period. All such amounts shall be due and payable to such Agent on
behalf of such Note Purchaser or Affected Party or to such Agent or
Co-Administrative Agent for its own account, as the case may be, on the
Distribution Date following receipt by the Issuer of such certificate, if such
certificate is received by the Issuer at least five Business Days prior to the
Determination Date related to such Distribution Date and otherwise shall be due
and payable on the following Distribution Date (or, if earlier, on the Final
Scheduled Distribution Date).

          (c) Each Equipment Loan Note Purchaser, each Receivables Note
Purchaser and each Participant holding an interest in either the Equipment Loan
Notes or Receivables Notes agrees that prior to the date on which the first
interest or fee payment hereunder is due thereto, it will deliver to the Issuer,
the Transferor, the Servicer, the Indenture Trustee, the applicable Agent and
the Co-Administrative Agent (i) if such Equipment Loan Note Purchaser,
Receivables Note Purchaser or Participant is not incorporated under the laws of
the United States or any state thereof or the District of Columbia, two duly
completed copies of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI or Form W-8BEN
(claiming treaty benefits) or in either case successor applicable forms required
to evidence that the Equipment Loan Note Purchaser, Receivables Note Purchaser
or Participant is entitled to receive payments under this Agreement and with
respect to the Equipment Loan Notes or Receivables Notes, as applicable, without
deduction or withholding of any United States federal income taxes, (ii) if such
Equipment Loan Purchaser, Receivable Note Purchaser or Participant is
incorporated under the laws of the United States of America or any state
thereof, or the District of Columbia, a duly completed U.S. Internal Revenue
Service Form W-9 or successor applicable or required forms, and (iii) such other
forms and information as may be required to confirm the availability of any
applicable exemption from United States federal, state or local withholding
taxes. Each Equipment Loan Note Purchaser, Receivables Note Purchaser or
Participant holding an interest in Equipment Loan Notes or Receivables Notes
also agrees to deliver to the Issuer, the Transferor, the Servicer, the
Indenture Trustee, the applicable Agent and each Co-Administrative Agent two
further copies of such Form W-8ECI, Form W-8BEN or Form W-9, or such successor
applicable forms or other manner of certification, as the case may be, on or
before the date that any such form expires or becomes obsolete or after the
occurrence of any event requiring a change in the most recent form previously
delivered by it hereunder, and such extensions or renewals thereof as may
reasonably be requested by the Servicer, the Issuer, the Transferor, an Agent or
a Co-Administrative Agent, unless in any such case, solely as a result of a
change in treaty, law or regulation occurring prior to the date on which any
such delivery would otherwise be required, the Equipment Loan Note Purchaser or
the Receivables Note Purchaser, as applicable, is no longer eligible to deliver
the then-applicable form set forth above and so advises the Servicer, the
Issuer, the Transferor and the applicable Agent and each Co-Administrative
Agent. Each Equipment Loan Note Purchaser and each Receivables Note Purchaser
certifies, represents and warrants as of the Closing Date, each Assignee and
each Participant (in either case other than a Support Party) shall certify,
represent and warrant as a condition of acquiring its Assignment or
Participation as of the effective date of the Transfer Supplement to which it is
a party or of such Participation, as the case may be, and each Support Party
shall certify, represent and warrant as of the effective date of its becoming a
Support Party, that (x) it is entitled to receive payments

                                      -19-

<PAGE>

under this Agreement and with respect to the Equipment Loan Notes or Receivables
Notes, as applicable, without deduction or withholding of any United States
federal income taxes and (y) it is entitled to an exemption from United States
backup withholding.

          (d) Each Note Purchaser and Affected Party agrees that it shall use
reasonable efforts to reduce or eliminate any amount due under Section 2.3 or
this Section 2.4, including but not limited to designating a different Investing
Office for its Equipment Loan Notes or Receivables Notes, as applicable, (or any
interest therein) if such designation will eliminate or materially reduce any
amount due under Section 2.3 or this Section 2.4 and will not, in the reasonable
opinion of such Note Purchaser or Affected Party be unlawful or otherwise
disadvantageous to such Note Purchaser or Affected Party or inconsistent with
its policies or result in any unreimbursed cost or expense to such Note
Purchaser or Affected Party or in an increase in the aggregate amount payable
under subsections 2.3(a) and 2.3(b). If such amount is not eliminated by any
such designation or no such designation is done and the Note Purchaser does not
waive payment of such amount, such Note Purchaser and the Agent for its
Purchaser Group hereby severally agree to use reasonable efforts to procure a
replacement purchaser not so affected and which is reasonably acceptable to the
Transferor, such Agent and each Co-Administrative Agent (a "Replacement
Purchaser") to replace such affected Note Purchaser. The Transferor shall also
have the right to procure a Replacement Purchaser, provided that such proposed
Replacement Purchaser is reasonably acceptable to the Agent for the affected
Purchaser Group and the Co-Administrative Agent. No replacement of a Note
Purchaser shall be effected pursuant to this subsection 2.4(d) if, after giving
effect thereto, any amounts shall be owing to the replaced Note Purchaser
hereunder. Each affected Note Purchaser hereby agrees to take all actions
necessary to permit a Replacement Purchaser to succeed to its rights and
obligations hereunder.

          Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) if the Note Purchaser being
replaced pursuant to this subsection is a CPC Committed Purchaser, the
Replacement Purchaser shall be acceptable to the related CP Conduit and (ii) if
the Note Purchaser being replaced pursuant to this subsection is a CP Conduit,
the Replacement Purchaser shall be acceptable to all related CPC Committed
Purchasers; and it shall be a condition of such replacement that such
Replacement Purchaser enter into substitute Support Facilities for those to
which the Note Purchaser being replaced is a party on terms mutually acceptable
to the parties thereto. In the event that a proposed Replacement Purchaser which
has been approved by the Transferor, the applicable Agent and each
Co-Administrative Agent as provided in this subsection is not acceptable to the
applicable CP Conduit or the applicable Committed Purchasers, as applicable, or
has not within a reasonable period entered into applicable Support Facilities,
and another replacement Note Purchaser has not been promptly procured as
provided in this subsection with the consent of all affected parties, then the
Note Purchaser which failed to consent to such replacement or to enter into such
Support Facilities may be replaced by a Replacement Purchaser and shall use
reasonable efforts to procure a Replacement Purchaser, in each case as provided
in this subsection. Amounts owing under this Section 2.4 by the Issuer shall be
due and payable in accordance with Section 8.2 of the Indenture.

          If such amount is not eliminated due to the failure to find an
acceptable Replacement Purchaser (or such Replacement Purchaser not being
acceptable to the related CP Conduit), and the affected Note Purchaser does not
waive payment of such amount, the

                                      -20-

<PAGE>

Transferor shall have the right to procure a replacement purchaser for such Note
Purchaser and any additional Note Purchaser in such Note Purchaser's Purchaser
Group (the "Exiting Note Purchaser Group") and a replacement agent for the
respective Agent in the Exiting Note Purchaser Group (collectively, the
"Replacement Purchaser Group"), provided that if the Exiting Note Purchaser
Group contains a member that is a Co-Administrative Agent, such proposed
Replacement Purchaser Group is reasonably acceptable to the remaining
Co-Administrative Agent. No replacement of an Exiting Note Purchaser Group shall
be effected pursuant to this subsection 2.4(d) if, after giving effect thereto,
any amounts shall be owing to any replaced member of such Exiting Note Purchaser
Group hereunder. Each member of the Exiting Note Purchaser Group hereby agrees
to take all actions necessary to permit the members of the Replacement Note
Purchaser Group to succeed to its rights and obligations hereunder.

          2.5 Indemnification.

          (a) The Issuer and ALS agree to jointly and severally indemnify and
hold harmless each Co-Administrative Agent, each Agent, each Note Purchaser and
each Affected Party and any director, officer, employee or agent thereof (each
such Person being an "Indemnitee") from and against any and all claims, damages,
losses, liabilities, costs or expenses (including reasonable fees and
out-of-pocket expenses of counsel) whatsoever (including claims under federal or
state securities laws), which the Indemnitee incurs (or which may be claimed
against the Indemnitee) by reason of or in connection with (i) the failure of
the offer and sale by or on behalf of the Issuer, the Transferor or any of their
affiliates of the Notes in accordance with this Agreement and the other Basic
Documents to comply with applicable law, (ii) the failure by the Issuer, the
Transferor, ALS or the Servicer (if the Servicer is ALS or an Affiliate thereof)
to comply with any covenant set forth in this Agreement or any other Basic
Document (provided that ALS shall not be liable for any indemnity arising under
this clause (ii) as a result of the Issuer's failure to increase or replenish
the Letter of Credit after the Closing Date pursuant to Section 3.27 of the
Indenture), (iii) reliance on any written false representation or warranty made
(including reaffirmation) by the Issuer, the Transferor, ALS or the Servicer (if
the Servicer is ALS or an Affiliate thereof) set forth in this Agreement or any
other Basic Document, (iv) the failure to vest in the Indenture Trustee a first
priority perfected security interest in the Trust Estate, (v) any failure of
ALS, as Servicer or otherwise, to perform its duties or obligations in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement or any of the other Basic
Documents, (vi) third party claims arising from the commingling of Collections
by the Issuer, the Servicer or the Transferor at any time with its other funds
or the funds of another Person, (vii) claims by third parties (including parties
to the Basic Documents only at a time when a Rapid Amortization Event exists and
at all times excluding claims arising among the Agents, Co-Administrative Agents
and Note Purchasers) arising out of the servicing of the Loans or Receivables,
the use or ownership of the Equipment, or the repossession (other than Losses
related to a decline in value of the Equipment repossessed) or operation by the
Servicer or any Affiliate thereof of any item of Equipment or collateral
therefore, but only so long as and with respect for actions taken while ALS is
the Servicer, (viii) any statement, omission or act in connection with the
offering, issuance, sale or delivery of any of the Notes and (ix) claims by
third parties relating to products liability, lender liability or any other
claims by third parties (including parties to the Basic Documents only at a time
when a Rapid Amortization Event exists and at all times excluding claims arising
among the Agents, Co-Administrative Agents and Note Purchasers) arising from the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any other Basic Document, except
(A) to the

                                      -21-

<PAGE>

extent that any such claim, damage, loss, liability, cost or expense shall be
caused by the bad faith, willful misconduct or gross negligence of an Indemnitee
within the same Equipment Loan Purchaser Group or Receivables Purchaser Group,
as applicable, as the Indemnitee making the claim in performing its obligations
under this Agreement, (B) for recourse as a result of nonpayment by Obligors for
credit reasons on the Accounts or the related Equipment Loans, (C) for recourse
as a result of nonpayment by Obligors for credit reasons on the Accounts or the
related Receivables or (D) to the extent the same constitute consequential,
special or punitive damages. Subject to the limitations set forth above, but
without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Issuer agrees to indemnify
and hold harmless each Indemnitee from and against any and all liabilities,
obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs,
expenses or disbursements of any kind whatsoever which may at any time
(including at any time following the payment of the obligations under this
Agreement, including payment of the Equipment Loan Note Principal Balance and
payment of the Receivables Note Principal Balance) be imposed on, incurred by or
asserted against such Indemnitee in any way relating to or arising out of this
Agreement, or any documents contemplated by or referred to herein or the
transactions contemplated hereby or any action taken or omitted by any
Indemnitee under or in connection with any of the foregoing; provided that the
Issuer shall not be liable under this sentence for the payment of any portion of
such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments,
suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of an Indemnitee within the same
Equipment Loan Purchaser Group or Receivables Purchaser Group, as applicable, as
the Indemnitee making the claim resulting from its own gross negligence or
willful misconduct. Promptly after receipt by an Indemnitee of notice of the
commencement of any action, such Indemnitee, as the case may be, will, if a
claim in respect thereof is to be made under this subsection 2.5(a), notify the
Issuer and the Transferor in writing of the commencement thereof; provided,
however, the omission to so notify the Issuer or the Transferor will not relieve
the Issuer or the Transferor from any liability which it may have to such
Indemnitee under this subsection 2.5(a) except to the extent the Issuer or the
Transferor was actually prejudiced by the failure to give such notices promptly.
Amounts owing under this Section 2.5(a) by the Issuer shall be due and payable
in accordance with Section 8.2 of the Indenture.

          (b) If any action or proceeding (including any governmental
investigation) shall be brought or asserted against any Indemnitee in respect of
which the indemnity provided above may be sought from ALS or the Issuer (the
"Indemnifying Party") each such Indemnitee shall promptly notify the
Indemnifying Party in writing, and the Indemnifying Party may, within a
reasonable time, irrevocably assume the defense thereof, including the
employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitee and the payment
of all expenses and reasonable legal fees; provided that failure to notify the
Indemnifying Party shall not relieve it from any liability it may have to such
Indemnitee except to the extent that it shall be actually prejudiced thereby;
provided, further, that, the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume
the defense of any such action or proceeding (i) unless the Indemnifying Party
shall have acknowledged in writing to the Indemnitee that such action or
proceeding is covered by the indemnification set forth in Section 2.5(a), (ii)
if the proceeding is a governmental proceeding involving the possible imposition
of any criminal liability or penalty, (iii) if the relief sought in such action
or proceeding is the seeing of injunctive relief against the Indemnifying Party
affecting property, assets or activity not related to this transaction, or (iv)
in the reasonable opinion of the Indemnitee, such defense or compromise involves
a conflict of interest between such Indemnitee and an Indemnifying Party. The
Indemnitee shall have the right to employ separate counsel in

                                      -22-

<PAGE>

any such action and to participate in the defense thereof at the expense of the
Indemnitee; provided, however that the fees and expenses of separate counsel to
the Indemnitee in any such proceeding shall be at the expense of the
Indemnifying Party if (i) the Indemnifying Party has agreed to pay such fees and
expenses, (ii) the Indemnifying Party shall have failed to assume the defense of
such action or proceeding or employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnitee in any such action or proceeding within a reasonable time after the
commencement of such action or (iii) the named parties to any such action or
proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the Indemnitee and the
Indemnifying Party, and the Indemnitee shall have been advised in writing by
counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses available to it which are
different from or additional to those available to the Indemnifying Party which
gives rise to a conflict of interest (in which case, if the Indemnitee notifies
the Indemnifying Party in writing that it elects to employ separate counsel at
the expense of the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnifying Party shall not have the
right to assume the defense of such action or proceeding on behalf of such
Indemnitee, it being understood, however, that the Indemnifying Party shall not,
in connection with any one such action or proceeding or separate but
substantially similar or related actions or proceedings in the same jurisdiction
arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the
reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys at any
time for the Indemnified Parties, which firm shall be designated in writing by
the Indemnitee and shall be reasonably acceptable to the Indemnitee). The
Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any settlement of any such action or
proceeding effected without its written consent to the extent that any such
settlement shall be prejudicial to the Indemnifying Party (to which the
Indemnified Party did not consent), but, if settled with its written consent, or
if there is a final non-appealable judgment for the plaintiff in any such action
or proceeding with respect to which the Indemnifying Party shall have received
notice in accordance with this paragraph, the Indemnifying Party agrees to
indemnify and hold the Indemnitees harmless from and against any loss or
liability by reason of such settlement or judgment.

          (c) Any Successor Servicer, by accepting its appointment pursuant to
the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, (i) shall agree to be bound by the terms,
covenants and conditions contained herein applicable to the Servicer and to be
subject to the duties and obligations of the Servicer hereunder, (ii) as of the
date of its acceptance, shall be deemed to have made with respect to itself only
the representations and warranties made by the Servicer in Section 4.2 (with
appropriate factual changes) and (iii) shall agree to indemnify and hold
harmless any Indemnitee from and against any and all claims, damages, losses,
liabilities, costs or expenses (including the fees and expenses of counsel)
whatsoever which such Indemnitee may incur (or which may be claimed against such
Indemnitee) by reason of the bad faith, negligence or willful misconduct of such
Servicer in exercising its powers and carrying out its obligations under this
Agreement, the Pooling and Servicing Agreement or any Related Document.

          (d) In the event that for any reason, any Note Purchaser receives any
repayment of (i) its share of the Equipment Loan Note Principal Balance (A)
other than on a Distribution Date or (B) on a Distribution Date if less than 2
Business Days' prior notice of such Distribution Date repayment is received
(which notice must specify the amount of such repayment), or (ii) its share of
the Receivables Note Principal Balance upon fewer than 1 Business Day's prior
written notice no later than 3:00 p.m., New York City time (which notice must
specify the amount of such repayment), then in any such case the Issuer agrees
to

                                      -23-

<PAGE>

indemnify and hold harmless each affected Note Purchaser against, and to
promptly pay on demand directly to such Note Purchaser the amount equal to any
loss, cost or expense incurred or suffered by such Note Purchaser as a result of
such change, repayment or other action, including any hedge breakage costs and
any loss, cost or reasonable out-of-pocket expense incurred or suffered by such
Note Purchaser (other than loss of profit) by reason of any prepayment expense
incurred or suffered by reason of the liquidation on redeployment of deposits or
other funds prepaid, repaid or otherwise acquired by such Note Purchaser, in
amounts which correspond to its share of the Equipment Loan Note Principal
Balance or Receivables Note Purchase Balance, as applicable. A statement setting
forth in reasonable detail the calculations of any additional amounts payable
pursuant to this Section 2.5 submitted by a Note Purchaser, an Agent, or a
Co-Administrative Agent, as the case may be, to the Issuer, the Transferor and
the Servicer shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

          2.6 Expenses, etc.

          (a) The Transferor, ALS and the Issuer (with respect to the Issuer, in
accordance with Section 8.2 of the Indenture) agree jointly and severally to pay
on demand (i) to each Co-Administrative Agent, each Agent, the initial Equipment
Loan Note Purchasers, and the initial Receivables Note Purchasers all reasonable
costs and expenses in connection with the preparation, execution, and delivery
of this Agreement and the other documents to be delivered hereunder or in
connection herewith, including the reasonable fees and out-of-pocket expenses of
counsel with respect thereto and the amounts due to Rating Agencies in
connection with their rating of the Notes and their review of the Note
Purchasers' acquisition and funding of the Notes (including all costs incurred
with respect to the confirmation of a CP Conduit's rating on its commercial
paper in connection therewith), (ii) to each Co-Administrative Agent, Agent,
Equipment Loan Note Purchaser and Receivables Note Purchaser, all reasonable
costs and expenses (including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) in
connection with the preparation, negotiation, execution, delivery, distribution,
review, amendment (including any requested waivers and consents) of this
Agreement or the Related Documents, and (iii) to each Co-Administrative Agent,
Agent, Equipment Loan Note Purchaser and Receivables Note Purchaser, on demand,
all reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable fees and expenses of
counsel), if any, in connection with the enforcement of this Agreement or any of
the Related Documents, and the other documents delivered thereunder or in
connection therewith. Amounts required to be paid by the Transferor pursuant to

                            ARTICLE 6 THE NOTE AGENTS

          6.1 Authorization and Action of the Note Agents. (a) Each Note
Purchaser hereby appoints and authorizes each Co-Administrative Agent to take
such action as agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers under this
Agreement, the Indenture, any Transfer and Servicing Agreement and any other
Related Documents as are delegated to any Administrative Agent by the terms
hereof and thereof, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental
thereto. Each Note Purchaser in each Purchaser Group hereby appoints and
authorizes the Agent for such Purchaser Group as the agent of such Note
Purchaser under this Agreement to take such action as agent on its behalf and to
exercise such powers under this Agreement, the Indenture, the Pooling and
Servicing Agreement and any other Related Documents as are delegated to such
Agent by the terms hereof and thereof, together with such powers as are
reasonably incidental thereto. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary
elsewhere in this Agreement, neither any Administrative Agent nor any Agent
(each Co-Administrative Agent and Agent being referred to in this Article as a
"Note Agent") shall have any duties or responsibilities, except those expressly

                                      -31-

<PAGE>

set forth herein, or any fiduciary relationship with any Note Purchaser, and no
implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or
liabilities shall be read into this Agreement or otherwise exist against any
Note Agent. In furtherance, and without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, each CP Conduit and each Committed Purchaser hereby appoints the
Co-Administrative Agent and the applicable Agent as its agent to execute and
deliver all further instruments and documents, and agrees to take all further
action that the Co-Administrative Agent or Agent, as applicable, may deem
necessary or appropriate or that a CP Conduit or a Committed Purchaser may
reasonably request in order to perfect, protect or more fully evidence the
interests transferred or to be transferred from time to time by the Transferor
or the Issuer hereunder, or to enable any of them to exercise or enforce any of
their respective rights hereunder. With respect to actions which are incidental
to the actions specifically delegated to any Agent hereunder, such Agent shall
not be required to take any such incidental action hereunder, but shall be
required to act or to refrain from acting (and shall be fully protected in
acting or refraining from acting) upon the direction of the Co-Administrative
Agent or upon the direction of the Note Purchaser in its Purchaser Group;
provided, however, no Note Agent shall be required to take any action hereunder
if the taking of such action, in the reasonable determination of such Note
Agent, shall be in violation of any applicable law, rule or regulation or
contrary to any provision of this Agreement or shall expose such Note Agent to
liability hereunder or otherwise. Each Note Agent shall exercise such rights and
powers vested in it by this Agreement, the Indenture, the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement and any other Related Documents, and use the same degree of care and
skill in their exercise, as a prudent person would exercise or use under the
circumstances in the conduct of such person's own affairs.

          (b) No Note Agent shall be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the
occurrence of any breach of this Agreement or the occurrence of any Rapid
Amortization Event or Event of Default unless such Note Agent has received
notice from the Issuer, the Transferor, the Servicer, the Indenture Trustee or
any Note Purchaser, referring to this Agreement and describing such event. In
the event that any Co-Administrative Agent receives such a notice, it shall
promptly give notice thereof to each Co-Administrative Agent and Agent, and in
the event any Agent receives such a notice, it shall promptly give notice
thereof to the Note Purchasers in its Purchaser Group. Each Co-Administrative
Agent and Agent shall take such action with respect to such event as shall be
reasonably directed by (i) the Required Equipment Loan Owners, (ii) the Required
Receivables Owners, (iii) the Required Equipment Loan Purchasers and (iv) the
Required Receivables Purchasers; provided, that unless and until such Note Agent
shall have received such directions, such Co-Administrative Agent or Agent may
(but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such
action, with respect to such event as it shall deem advisable in the best
interests of the Note Purchasers or of the Note Purchasers in its Purchaser
Group, as applicable.

          (c) The Co-Administrative Agents shall not, without the prior written
consent of each Agent and each Note Purchaser, agree or consent to any
amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement, the
Transfer and Servicing Agreements or the Indenture which would in any way (i)
reduce, impair or change the timing of payments required to be made by the
Transferor, the Issuer or the Servicer or the application of the proceeds of
such payments, (ii) increase the Servicing Fee, (iii) release any material
portion of the property subject to the liens provided by the Pooling and
Servicing Agreement and the Indenture (other than as expressly contemplated
herein or therein) or (iv) permit the appointment of any Person (other

                                      -32-

<PAGE>

than the Back-up Servicer) as Successor Servicer. No Agent shall agree to any
amendment of this Agreement which increases the dollar amount of the commitment
of its related Committed Purchaser without the prior consent of such Committed
Purchaser. In addition, each Agent agrees that it shall not agree to any
amendment of this Agreement not specifically described in the two preceding
sentences without the consent of the Committed Purchasers and the related CP
Conduit (if any) in its Purchaser Group. In the event the Agent requests a
Person's consent pursuant to the foregoing provisions and the Agent does not
receive a response to such request (either positive or negative) from such
Person within 10 Business Days of such Person's receipt of such request, then
such Person (and its percentage interest hereunder) shall be disregarded in
determining whether the Agent shall have obtained sufficient consent hereunder.

          (d) Each Note Agent may execute any of its duties under any of the
Related Documents by or through agents or attorneys-in-fact and shall be
entitled to advice of counsel concerning all matters pertaining to such duties.
No Note Agent shall be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any
agents or attorneys-in-fact selected by it with reasonable care.

          6.2 Note Agent's Reliance, Etc. Neither any Note Agent nor any of its
directors, officers, agents or employees shall be liable to any CP Conduit or
Committed Purchaser for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it or them as
a Note Agent under or in connection with this Agreement, the Indenture, the
Transfer and Servicing Agreements or any other Related Document, except for its
or their own gross negligence or willful misconduct. Without limiting the
foregoing, each Note Agent: (i) may consult with legal counsel (including
counsel for the Transferor, the Issuer or the Servicer), independent public
accountants and other experts selected by it and shall not be liable for any
action taken or omitted to be taken in good faith by it in accordance with the
advice of such counsel, accountants or experts; (ii) makes no warranty or
representation to any CP Conduit or any Committed Purchaser and shall not be
responsible to any CP Conduit or any Committed Purchaser for any statements,

or observance of any of the terms, covenants or conditions of this Agreement,

Document on the part of the Transferor, the Issuer or the Servicer or to inspect
the property (including the books and records) of the Transferor, the Issuer or
the Servicer; (iv) shall not be responsible to any CP Conduit or any Committed
Purchaser for the due execution, legality, validity, enforceability,
genuineness, sufficiency or value of this Agreement, the Indenture, any Transfer
and Servicing Agreement or any other Related Document or any other instrument or
document furnished pursuant hereto or thereto; and (v) shall incur no liability

Document by acting upon any notice (including notice by telephone), consent,
certificate or other instrument or writing (which may be by telex) believed by
it to be genuine and signed or sent by the proper party or parties. Each Note
Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under
any of the Related Documents unless it shall first receive such advice or
concurrence of the Required Equipment Loan Note Owners, the Required Equipment
Loan Note Purchasers, the Required Receivables Note Owners and the Required

indemnified to its satisfaction by (A) in the case of the Co-Administrative

the Required Equipment Loan Note Owners, (ii) the Required Equipment Loan Note
Purchasers, (iii) the Required Receivables Note Owners and (iv) the Required

          6.3 Credit Decision. Each CP Conduit and each Committed Purchaser
acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon either
Co-Administrative Agent, any of the Co-Administrative Agents' Affiliates, any
Agent, any other Committed Purchaser or any other CP Conduit and based upon such
documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own evaluation
and decision to enter into this Agreement, the Indenture, any Transfer and
Servicing Agreement and any other Related Documents to which it is a party and,
if it so determines, to accept the transfer to its related Agent on its behalf
of its interest in the Equipment Loan Note or Receivables Note, as applicable,
hereunder. Each CP Conduit and each Committed Purchaser also acknowledges that
it will, independently and without reliance upon any Co-Administrative Agent,
any of the Co-Administrative Agents' Affiliates, any Agent, any other Committed
Purchaser or any other CP Conduit and based on such documents and information as
it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own decisions in
taking or not taking action under this Agreement, the Indenture, any Transfer
and Servicing Agreement and any other Related Documents to which it is a party.
Except, in the case of a Note Agent, for notices, reports and other documents
received by such Note Agent under Section 5.1, no Note Agent shall have any duty
or responsibility to provide any Note Purchaser with any credit or other
information concerning the business, operations, property, condition (financial
or otherwise), prospects or creditworthiness of the Transferor, the Servicer,
the Issuer, the Accounts, the Equipment Loans, the Receivables or the Indenture
Trustee which may come into the possession of such Note Agent or any of its
officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates.

          6.4 Indemnification of each Note Agent. (i) The Committed Purchasers
agree to indemnify each Co-Administrative Agent in its capacity as such (without
limiting the obligation (if any) of the Issuer, the Transferor and the Servicer
to reimburse each Co-Administrative Agent for any such amounts), ratably
according to their respective Commitments (or, if the Commitments have
terminated, Percentage Interests), and (ii) the Committed Purchasers in each
Purchaser Group agree to indemnify the Agent for such Purchaser Group in its
capacity as such (without limiting the obligation (if any) of the Issuer, the
Transferor and the Servicer to reimburse such Agent for any such amounts),
ratably according to their respective Commitments (or, if the Commitments have
terminated, Percentage Interests), in each case from and against any
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits,
costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever which may be
imposed on,

                                      -34-

<PAGE>

incurred by, or asserted against such Note Agent (in its capacity as such) in
any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the Indenture, the
Transfer and Servicing Agreements and the other Related Documents or such action
taken or omitted by such Note Agent hereunder or thereunder, provided that such
Committed Purchaser shall not be liable for any portion of such liabilities,
obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs,
expenses or disbursements resulting from such Note Agent's gross negligence or
willful misconduct. Without limitation of the foregoing, the Committed
Purchasers agree to reimburse such Note Agent, ratably according to their

promptly upon demand for any out-of-pocket expenses (including counsel fees)
incurred by such Note Agent in connection with the administration, modification,
amendment or enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal proceedings or
otherwise) of, or legal advice in respect of rights or responsibilities under,
this Agreement, the Indenture, any Transfer and Servicing Agreement and any
other Related Documents, to the extent that such expenses are incurred in the
interests of or otherwise in respect of the CP Conduits or the Committed
Purchasers hereunder and/or thereunder and to the extent that such Note Agent is
not reimbursed for such expenses by the Transferor, the Issuer or the Servicer.
The agreements in this Section 6.4 shall survive the payment of the obligations
under this Agreement, including the Equipment Loan Note Principal Balance and
the Receivables Note Principal Balance.

          6.5 Agents in their Individual Capacity. Each Note Agent and its
Affiliates may make loans to, accept deposits from and generally engage in any
kind of business with the Issuer, the Transferor or the Servicer as though such
Note Agent were not an agent hereunder. In addition, the Note Purchasers
acknowledge that one or more Persons which are Note Agents may act (i) as
administrator, sponsor or agent for one or more CP Conduits and in such capacity
act and may continue to act on behalf of each such CP Conduit in connection with
its business, and (ii) as the agent for certain financial institutions under the
liquidity and credit enhancement agreements relating to this Agreement to which
any one or more CP Conduits is party and in various other capacities relating to
the business of any such CP Conduit under various agreements. Any such Person,
in its capacity as Note Agent, shall not, by virtue of its acting in any such
other capacities, be deemed to have duties or responsibilities hereunder or be
held to a standard of care in connection with the performance of its duties as a
Note Agent other than as expressly provided in this Agreement. Any Person which
is a Note Agent may act as a Note Agent without regard to and without additional
duties or liabilities arising from its role as such administrator or agent or
arising from its acting in any such other capacity.

          6.6 Successor Co-Administrative Agent; Successor Agent. Each
Co-Administrative Agent may resign at any time, effective upon the appointment
and acceptance of a successor Administrative Agent as provided below, by giving
written notice thereof to each Agent, each CP Conduit, each Committed Purchaser,
the Indenture Trustee, the Issuer, the Transferor and the Servicer. If an
Administrative Agent shall resign as Co-Administrative Agent under this
Agreement, then the Required Equipment Loan Note Purchasers, the Required
Equipment Loan Note Owners, the Required Receivables Note Purchasers and the
Required Receivables Note Owners, in each case for all Purchaser Groups, shall
appoint from among the Committed Purchasers a successor administrative agent. If
no such successor Co-Administrative Agent shall have been so appointed, and
shall have accepted such appointment, within thirty (30) days after such
retiring Co-Administrative Agent's giving of notice of resignation, then such
retiring Co-Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Note Purchasers, appoint
a successor Co-

                                      -35-

<PAGE>

Administrative Agent with the prior consent of the Agents (which such consent
will not be unreasonably withheld) which such successor Co-Administrative Agent
shall be either (i) a commercial bank or other financial institution organized
under the laws of the United States or of any state thereof and having a
combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000 or (ii) an Affiliate of
such a Person of the type described in clause (i). Any Agent may resign at any
time, effective upon the appointment and acceptance of a successor Agent as
provided below, by giving written notice thereof to the Note Purchasers in its
Purchaser Group, each Co-Administrative Agent and each other Agent, the
Indenture Trustee, the Issuer, the Transferor and the Servicer. If an Agent
shall resign as Agent under this Agreement, then the Required Equipment Loan
Note Purchasers and the Required Equipment Loan Note Owners or the Required
Receivables Note Purchasers and the Required Receivables Note Owners, in each
case for the applicable Purchaser Group, shall appoint from among the Committed
Purchasers in such Purchaser Group a successor agent for such Purchaser Group.
If no such successor Agent shall have been so appointed, and shall have accepted
such appointment, within thirty (30) days after the retiring Agent's giving of
notice of resignation, then the retiring Agent may, on behalf of the CP Conduits
and the Committed Purchasers in such Purchaser Group, appoint a successor Agent
for such group which shall be either (i) a commercial bank or other financial
institution organized under the laws of the United States or of any state
thereof and having a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000 or
(ii) an Affiliate of such a Person of the type described in clause (i). An Agent
that is in the same Purchaser Group as Bear Stearns shall (subject to such
conditions as such Agent and Bear Stearns may mutually agree) resign upon the
written request of the Committed Purchasers in its Purchaser Group and will
thereupon assign to such Committed Purchasers all of its rights under its Note
and the other Transaction Documents. Such Agent shall promptly notify the
Indenture Trustee of such assignment and any corresponding changes in wiring
instructions. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as a Note Agent hereunder
by a successor Note Agent, such successor Note Agent shall thereupon succeed to
and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the
applicable retiring Note Agent accruing after the date of its appointment, and
the retiring Note Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations
under this Agreement. After any retiring Note Agent's resignation hereunder as
Note Agent, the provisions of this Article VI shall continue to inure to its
benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was such
Note Agent under this Agreement.

          6.7 Payments by an Agent. Unless specifically allocated to a CP
Conduit or a Committed Purchaser pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, all
amounts received by an Agent on behalf of the related CP Conduit(s) or Committed
Purchasers) shall be paid by such Agent to such CP Conduit(s) or Committed
Purchaser(s), as applicable (at the account specified in writing to such Agent)
on the Business Day received by such Agent, unless such amounts are received
after 12:00 noon (New York time) on such Business Day, in which case such Agent
shall use its reasonable efforts to pay such amounts, on such Business Day, but,
in any event, shall pay such amounts not later than 11:00 a.m. (New York time)

amended, or any other securities law, the Equipment Loan Notes or the
Receivables Notes (or any interest therein) acquired by it pursuant to this
Agreement or any Transfer Supplement. Each Equipment Loan Note Owner and

any Person and who will furnish to the Issuer, the Transferor, the Servicer, the
Indenture Trustee, each Co-Administrative Agent, the Agent for its Purchaser

referred to herein as a "Transfer") of an Equipment Loan Note, Receivables Note
or any interest therein may be made only in accordance with this Section 7.1(c)
and the Indenture. Any partial Transfer of an interest in an Equipment Loan
Note, a Receivables Note, a Commitment or any Purchaser Percentage by a
Committed Purchaser shall be in respect of, at least $5,000,000 in the
aggregate, which may be composed of (A) Equipment Loan Note Principal Balance or

<PAGE>

percentage interest in all payments made with respect to the Note Purchaser's
interest in such Note. Unless the Transfer occurs between members of the same
Purchaser Group, no Equipment Loan Note or Receivables Note or any interest
therein may be Transferred to any Person (each, a "Transferee") unless prior to
the Transfer the Transferee shall have executed and delivered to the Agent, the
Issuer, the Transferor and the Servicer an Investment Letter.

               Each of the Issuer, the Transferor and the Servicer authorizes
each Note Purchaser to disclose to any Transferee and Support Party and to any
prospective Transferee or Support Party which is a Permitted Transferee any and
all confidential information in the Note Purchaser's possession concerning this
Agreement or the Related Documents or concerning the Accounts, the Equipment
Loans or the Receivables, as applicable, or such party which has been delivered
to any Agent or such Note Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement or the Related
Documents (including information obtained pursuant to rights of inspection
granted hereunder) or which has been delivered to such Note Purchaser by or on
behalf of the Issuer, the Transferor and the Servicer in connection with such
Note Purchaser's credit evaluation of the Accounts, the Equipment Loans or the
Receivables, as applicable, the Issuer, the Transferor or the Servicer prior to
becoming a party to, or purchasing an interest in this Agreement, the Equipment
Loan Notes or the Receivables Notes.

          (d) Each Equipment Loan Note Purchaser or Receivables Note Purchaser
may, in accordance with applicable law, at any time grant participations in all
or part of its Commitment or its interest in the Equipment Loan Notes or
Receivables Notes, as applicable, including the payments due to it under this
Agreement and the Related Documents (each, a "Participation"), to any Permitted
Transferee (each such Permitted Transferee, a "Participant"); provided, however,
that no Participation shall be granted to any Person (i) until such Person,
unless such Person is a member of the same Purchaser Group, shall have executed
and delivered to the Agent, the Issuer, the Transferor and the Servicer an
Investment Letter, (ii) unless and until the Agent for such Equipment Loan Note
Purchaser's Purchaser Group or Receivables Note Purchaser's Purchaser Group
shall have consented thereto, and (iii) that such Participation consists of a
pro rata percentage interest in all payments made with respect to such Equipment
Loan Note Purchaser's or Receivables Note Purchaser's beneficial interest (if
any) in the Equipment Loan Notes or Receivable Notes, as applicable. In
connection with any such Participation, each Agent for a Purchaser Group shall
maintain a register of each Participant of members of its Purchaser Group and
the amount of each related Participation. Each Equipment Loan Note Purchaser and
Receivables Note Purchaser hereby acknowledges and agrees that (A) any such
Participation will not alter or affect such Equipment Loan Note Purchaser's or
Receivables Note Purchaser's direct obligations hereunder, and (B) neither the
Indenture Trustee, the Transferor, the Issuer nor the Servicer shall have any
obligation to have any communication or relationship with any Participant. Each
Equipment Loan Note Purchaser, Receivables Note Purchaser and each Participant
shall comply with the provisions of subsection 2.4(c). No Participant shall be
entitled to Transfer all or any portion of its Participation, without the prior
written consent of the Agent for its Purchaser Group and having complied with
the requirements set forth in this subsection 7.1(d). Each Participant shall be
entitled to receive additional amounts and indemnification pursuant to Sections
2.3, 2.4 and 2.5 as if such Participant were an Equipment Loan Note Purchaser or
Receivables Note Purchaser, as applicable, and such Sections applied to its
Participation; provided, in the case of Section 2.4, that such Participant has
complied with the provisions of subsection 2.4(c) as if it were an

                                      -38-

<PAGE>

Equipment Loan Note Purchaser or Receivables Note Purchaser, as applicable. Each
Equipment Loan Note Purchaser and Receivables Note Purchaser shall give the
Agent for its Purchaser Group notice of the consummation of any sale by it of a
Participation. It shall be a further condition to the grant of any Participation
that the Participant shall have certified, represented and warranted that (i) it
is entitled to (A) receive payments with respect to its participation without
deduction or withholding of any United States federal income taxes and (B) an
exemption from United States backup withholding, and (ii) to the extent such
Participant has not otherwise directly provided such forms to the Servicer and
the Indenture Trustee, (A) prior to the date on which the first interest payment
is due to such Participant, such Participant will provide to the Servicer, the
Transferor and Indenture Trustee, the forms described in subsection 2.4(c) as
though the Participant were an Equipment Loan Note Purchaser or Receivables Note
Purchaser, as applicable, and (B) such Participant similarly will provide
subsequent forms as described in subsection 2.4(c) with respect to such
Participant as though it were an Equipment Loan Note Purchaser or Receivables
Note Purchaser, as applicable.

          (e) Each Equipment Loan Note Purchaser and Receivables Note Purchaser
may, with the consent of the Agent for its Purchaser Group and in accordance
with applicable law and the Indenture, sell or assign (each, an "Assignment"),
to any Permitted Transferee (each, an "Assignee") all or any part of its
Commitment (if any) or its interest in the Equipment Loan Notes or the
Receivables Notes, as applicable, and its rights and obligations under this
Agreement and the Related Documents pursuant to an agreement substantially in
the form attached hereto as Exhibit A hereto (a "Transfer Supplement"), executed
by such Assignee and the Equipment Loan Note Purchaser or the Receivables Note
Purchaser, as applicable, and delivered to the Agent for its Purchaser Group for
its acceptance and consent or, in the case of an assignment, participation or
pledge by a CP Conduit to a CPC Committed Purchaser within its Purchaser Group,
pursuant to its Support Facility documentation; provided, however, that (i) no
Assignment, other than to a member of the same Purchaser Group, shall be
effective unless prior to the Assignment the Assignee shall have executed and
delivered to the Agent, the Issuer, the Transferor and the Servicer an
Investment Letter, (ii) no assignment or sale by a CPC Committed Purchaser shall
be effective without the consent of the CP Conduit in its Purchaser Group and
(iii) in no event shall the consent of an Agent be required in the case of an
assignment, participation or pledge by a CP Conduit of its interest in the
Equipment Loan Notes or Receivables Notes, as applicable, and its rights and
obligations under this Agreement and the Related Documents to any one or more of
the CPC Committed Purchasers in its Purchaser Group. From and after the
effective date determined pursuant to such Transfer Supplement, (x) the Assignee
thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent provided in such Transfer
Supplement, have the rights and obligations of an Equipment Loan Note Purchaser
or Receivables Note Purchaser, as applicable, hereunder and under the Basic
Documents as set forth therein and (y) the transferor Equipment Loan Note
Purchaser or Receivables Note Purchaser, as applicable, shall, to the extent
provided in such Transfer Supplement, be released from its Commitment and other
obligations under this Agreement; provided, however, that after giving effect to
each such Assignment, the obligations released by any such Equipment Loan Note
Purchaser or Receivables Note Purchaser, as applicable, shall have been assumed
by an Assignee or Assignees. Such Transfer Supplement shall be deemed to amend
this Agreement to the extent, and only to the extent, necessary to reflect the
addition of such Assignee and the resulting adjustment of Percentage Interests,
Purchaser Percentages or Liquidity Percentages arising from the Assignment. Upon
its receipt and acceptance of a duly executed Transfer

                                      -39-

<PAGE>

Supplement, the Agent for the applicable Purchaser Group (or, in the case of an
Assignment by which a new Purchaser Group is added to this Agreement, each
Co-Administrative Agent) shall on the effective date determined pursuant thereto
give notice of such acceptance to the Issuer, the Transferor, the Servicer and
the Indenture Trustee.

          Upon instruction to register a transfer of a Note Purchaser's interest
in the Equipment Loan Notes or Receivables Notes (or portion thereof) and
surrender for registration of transfer of such Note Purchaser's Equipment Loan
Notes or Receivables Notes, as applicable) (if applicable) and delivery to the
Transferor, the Issuer, the Servicer and the Indenture Trustee of an Investment
Letter, executed by the registered owner (and the beneficial owner if it is a
Person other than the registered owner), and receipt by the Indenture Trustee of
a copy of the duly executed related Transfer Supplement and such other documents
as may be required under this Agreement, such interest in the Equipment Loan
Notes (or portion thereof) or the Receivables Notes (or portion thereof), as
applicable, shall be transferred in the records of the Indenture Trustee and the
applicable Agent and, if requested by the Assignee, new Equipment Loan Notes or
Receivables Notes, as applicable, shall be issued to the Assignee and, if
applicable, the transferor Note Purchaser in amounts reflecting such Transfer as
provided in the Indenture. To the extent of any conflict between the provisions
of this Section 7.1 and any provisions of Section 2.12 of the Indenture
applicable to Transfers of Equipment Loan Notes or Receivables Notes (or
interests therein), the provisions of this Section 7.1 shall control. Successive
registrations of Transfers as aforesaid may be made from time to time as
desired, and each such registration of a transfer to a new registered owner
shall be noted on the Note Register.

          (f) Each Note Purchaser may pledge its interest in the Equipment Loan
Notes or Receivables Notes, as applicable, to any Federal Reserve Bank as
collateral in accordance with applicable law.

          (g) Any Note Purchaser shall have the option to change its Investing
Office, provided that such Note Purchaser shall continue to be in compliance
with the provisions of subsections 2.4(b) and 2.4(c).

          (h) Each Affected Party shall be entitled to receive additional
payments and indemnification pursuant to Sections 2.3, 2.4 and 2.5 as though it
were a Note Purchaser and such Section applied to its interest in or commitment
to acquire an interest in the Equipment Loan Notes or Receivables Notes, as
applicable; provided that such Affected Party shall not be entitled to
additional payments pursuant to (i) Section 2.3 by reason of Regulatory Changes
which occurred prior to the date it became an Affected Party or (ii) Section 2.4
attributable to its failure to satisfy the requirements of subsection 2.4(c) as
if it were a Note Purchaser, and provided further, that unless such Affected
Party is a Permitted Transferee or has been consented to by the Transferor, such
Affected Party shall be entitled to receive additional amounts pursuant to
Sections 2.3 or 2.4 only to the extent that its related CP Conduit would have
been entitled to receive such amounts in the absence of the commitment and
Support Advances from such Affected Party.

          (i) Each Affected Party claiming increased amounts described in
Sections 2.3or 2.4 shall furnish, through its related CP Conduit, to the Issuer,
the Transferor, the Servicer, the Indenture Trustee and the Agent for the
applicable Purchaser Group a certificate setting forth

                                      -40-

<PAGE>

the basis and amount of each request by such Affected Party for any such amounts
referred to in Sections 2.3 or 2.4, such certificate to be conclusive with
respect to the factual information set forth therein absent manifest error.

          (j) In the event that a Committed Purchaser is a Downgraded Purchaser,
the related CP Conduit shall have the right to replace such Committed Purchaser
with a replacement Committed Purchaser consented to by the Transferor (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), which "Replacement Purchaser" shall
succeed to the rights of such Committed Purchaser under this Agreement in
respect of its Commitment as a Committed Purchaser, and such Committed Purchaser
shall assign such Commitment and its interest in the Equipment Loan Notes or
Receivables Notes, as applicable, to such replacement Committed Purchaser in
accordance with the provisions of this Section 7.1; provided, that (A) such
Committed Purchaser shall not be replaced hereunder with a new investor until
such Committed Purchaser has been paid in full its Percentage Interest of the
Equipment Loan Note Principal Balance or Receivables Note Principal Balance, as
applicable, and all accrued and unpaid interest thereon by such new investor and
all other amounts (including all amounts owing under Sections 2.3 and 2.4) owed
to it and to all Participants with respect to such Committed Purchaser pursuant
to this Agreement, and (ii) if the Committed Purchaser to be replaced is a Note
Agent, a replacement agent shall have been appointed in accordance with Section
6.6, and the Note Agent to be replaced shall have been paid all amounts owing to
it as agent pursuant to this Agreement. For purposes of this subsection, a
Committed Purchaser shall be a "Downgraded Purchaser" if and so long as the
credit rating assigned to its short-term obligations by Moody's or Standard &
Poor's on the date on which it became a party to this Agreement shall have been
reduced or withdrawn, or as may be otherwise agreed among the Issuer, such
Committed Purchaser and the CP Conduit in its Purchaser Group.

          Notwithstanding the foregoing or the provisions of subsection 7.1(j),
if the Note Purchaser being replaced pursuant to this subsection is a Committed
Purchaser, the Replacement Purchaser shall be acceptable to the CP Conduit in
its Purchaser Group in its sole discretion, and it shall be a condition of such
replacement that such Replacement Purchaser enter into substitute Support
Facilities for those to which the Note Purchaser being replaced is a party on
terms mutually acceptable to the parties thereto. In addition, if the Note
Purchaser to be replaced is an Agent or a Co-Administrative Agent, or a CP
Conduit which is administered or sponsored by an Agent or a Co-Administrative
Agent, it shall be a condition of such replacement that a replacement Agent or
Co-Administrative Agent shall have been appointed in accordance with Section
6.6, and the Agent or Co-Administrative Agent to be replaced shall have been
paid all amounts owing to it as Agent or Co-Administrative Agent, as applicable
pursuant to this Agreement.

          (k) Without limiting the foregoing, each CP Conduit may, from time to
time, with prior or concurrent notice to the Servicer, in one transaction or a
series of transactions, assign all or a portion of its Percentage Interest in
the Equipment Loan Note Principal Balance or Receivables Note Principal Balance,
as applicable, and its rights and obligations under this Agreement and any other
Basic Document to which it is a party to a Conduit Assignee. Upon and to the
extent of such assignment by the CP Conduit to a Conduit Assignee, (i) such
Conduit Assignee shall be the owner of the assigned portion of such Percentage
Interest, (ii) the related administrator for such Conduit Assignee will act as
the Agent for such Conduit Assignee, with

right to assign to another Conduit Assignee as provided in this paragraph), (iv)

treat, and to take no action inconsistent with such treatment of the Equipment
Loan Notes and Receivables Notes (to the extent permitted by law).

Issuer, the Servicer or the Indenture Trustee, as the case may be, shall have
received notice thereof).

          8.3 No Waiver; Cumulative Remedies. No failure to exercise and no
delay in exercising, on the part of any party hereto, any right, remedy, power
or privilege under any of the Related Documents shall operate as a waiver
thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or

exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege.
The rights, remedies, powers and privileges provided in the Related Documents
are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights, remedies, powers and privileges
provided by law.

          8.4 Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the Issuer, the Transferor, ALS, the Servicer, the
Co-Administrative Agents, the Agents, the Note Purchasers, any Transferee and
their respective successors and permitted assigns, and, to the extent provided
herein, to each Indemnitee, Participant and Support Party and their respective
successors and assigns; provided that, except as provided in Section 8.5 or in
Section 9.03 of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the Issuer, the Transferor
and the Servicer may not assign or transfer any of their respective rights or
obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the
Control Party; provided, further, that (i) in connection with any such
assignment the assignee shall expressly agree in writing to assume all the
obligations of the Issuer, the Transferor or the Servicer, as applicable,
hereunder and (ii) no such assignment made without the prior written consent of
the Control Party shall relieve the Issuer, the Transferor, ALS or the Servicer,
as applicable, of any of its obligations hereunder and provided further that no
assignment permitted hereunder shall relieve the Issuer, the Transferor, ALS or
the Servicer, as applicable, from any obligations arising hereunder prior to
such assignment (including obligations with respect to breaches of
representations and warranties made herein).

          8.5 Successors to Servicer. In the event that a transfer of servicing
occurs under Section 9.03 of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, (i) from and
after the effective date of such transfer, the successor servicer (the
"Successor Servicer") shall be the successor in all respects to the Servicer and
shall be responsible for the performance of all functions to be performed by the
Servicer from and after such date, except as provided in the Pooling and
Servicing Agreement, and shall be subject to all the responsibilities, duties
and liabilities relating thereto placed on the Servicer by the terms and
provisions hereof, and all references in this Agreement to the Servicer shall be
deemed to refer to the Successor Servicer, and (ii) as of the

                                       46

<PAGE>

date of such transfer, the Successor Servicer shall be deemed to have made with
respect to itself the representations and warranties made in Section 4.2 (with
appropriate factual changes); provided, however, that the references to the
Servicer contained in Section 5.1 shall be deemed to refer to the Servicer with
respect to responsibilities, duties and liabilities arising out of an act or
acts, or omission, or an event or events giving rise to such responsibilities,
duties and liabilities and occurring during such time that the Servicer was
Servicer under this Agreement and shall be deemed to refer to the Successor
Servicer with respect to responsibilities, duties and liabilities arising out of
an act or acts, or omission, or an event or events giving rise to such
responsibilities, duties and liabilities and occurring during such time that the
Successor Servicer acts as Servicer under this Agreement; provided, however, to
the extent that an obligation to indemnify Indemnitees under Section 2.5 arises
as a result of any act or failure to act of any Successor Servicer in the
performance of servicing obligations under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement,
such indemnification obligation shall be of the Successor Servicer and not its
predecessor.

          8.6 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed by one or more of the
parties to this Agreement on any number of separate counterparts, and all of
said counterparts taken together shall be deemed to constitute one and the same
instrument.

          8.7 Severability. Any provisions of this Agreement which are
prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction,
be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without
invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or
unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render
unenforceable such provisions in any other jurisdiction.

          8.8 Integration. This Agreement, the Applicable Margin Fee Letter, and
the Indenture represent the agreement of the Issuer, the Transferor, the
Servicer, the Co-Administrative Agents, the Agents and the Note Purchasers with
respect to the subject matter hereof, and there are no promises, undertakings,
representations or warranties by any party hereto relative to subject matter
hereof not expressly set forth or referred to herein or therein or in the
Related Documents.

proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or for recognition or

agrees that all claims in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard
and determined in such New York State or, to the extent permitted by law,

                                      -47-

now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such action or proceeding in
any such court and any objection it may now or hereafter have that such action
or proceeding was brought in an inconvenient court, and agrees not to plead or
claim the same; (v) consents to service of process in the manner provided for
notices in Section 8.2 (provided that, nothing in this Agreement shall affect
the right of any such party to serve process in any other manner permitted by
law); and (vi) waives, to the maximum extent not prohibited by law, any right it
may have to claim or recover in any such action or proceeding any special,
exemplary, punitive or consequential damages.

          8.11 Termination. This Agreement shall remain in full force and effect

Agreement and any amounts payable to the Co-Administrative Agents, the Agents,

          (a) It is expressly understood and agreed by the parties hereto that

the Trust Agreement, in the exercise of the powers and authority conferred and
vested in it, (ii) each of the representations, undertakings and agreements
herein made on the part of the Issuer is made and intended not as personal
representations, undertakings and agreements by Wilmington Trust Company but is
made and intended for the purpose of binding only the Issuer, (iii) nothing

Conduit is not a Qualified Special Purpose Entity that is not required, under
generally accepted accounting principals, to consolidate its financial
statements with any other entity, or (ii) a cost under Section 2.3, the parties
agree to negotiate in good faith to amend the Basic Agreements in order to
eliminate the consolidation requirement or effect of such Regulatory Change;
provided, however that no party shall be obligated to take any action (or make
any amendments) if in the reasonable opinion of such party any such amendment to
the Basic Documents will be unlawful or otherwise disadvantageous or
inconsistent with its policies or regulatory restrictions or result in any
liability, unreimbursed cost or expense to such party.

          8.16 Excess Funds. A CP Conduit shall be required to make payment of
the amounts required to be paid pursuant hereto by such CP Conduit only if the
applicable CP Conduit has Excess Funds (as defined below). If the applicable CP
Conduit does not have Excess Funds, the excess of the amount due hereunder over
the amount paid shall not constitute a "claim" (as defined in Section 101(5) of
the Bankruptcy Code) against such CP Conduit until such time as such CP Conduit
has Excess Funds. If a CP Conduit does not have sufficient Excess Funds to make
any payment due hereunder, then such CP Conduit may pay a lesser amount and make
additional payments that in the aggregate equal the amount of the deficiency as
soon as possible thereafter. The term "Excess Funds" means, at any time,
proceeds of commercial paper notes issued, and advances under a Support Facility
made, to fund a payment to be made by a CP Conduit hereunder and which are
available to make such payment in accordance with the program documents
governing such CP Conduit's commercial paper program; provided that in no event
will Excess Funds be greater than the excess of (a) the aggregate projected
value of the applicable CP Conduit's assets and other property (including

                                      -49-

cash and cash equivalents), over (b) the sum of (i) the sum of all scheduled
payments of principal, interest and other amounts payable on publicly or
privately placed indebtedness of such CP Conduit for borrowed money, plus (ii)
the sum of all other liabilities, indebtedness and other obligations of such CP
Conduit for borrowed money or owed to any credit or liquidity provider, together
with all unpaid interest then accrued thereon, plus (iii) all taxes payable by
such CP Conduit to the Internal Revenue Service, plus (iv) all other
indebtedness, liabilities and obligations of such CP Conduit then due and
payable, but the amount of any liability, indebtedness or obligation of such CP
Conduit shall not exceed the projected value of the assets to which recourse for
such liability, indebtedness or obligation is limited.
