be eligible for such awards, if any, under the Company's stock option plan as shall be granted to the Executive by the Compensation Committee or other appropriate designee of the Board acting in its

with any such interest and penalties, being hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Excise Tax"), then the Executive shall be entitled to receive an additional payment (a "Gross-Up
Payment") in an amount such that after payment by the Executive of all federal, state and local taxes (including any interest or penalties imposed with respect to such taxes), including, without
limitation, any income taxes (and any interest and penalties imposed with respect thereto) and Excise Tax imposed upon the Gross-Up Payment, the Executive retains an amount of the

determinations required to be made under this Section&nbsp;12, including whether and when a Gross-Up Payment is required and the amount of such
Gross-Up Payment and the assumptions to be utilized in arriving at such determination, shall be made by a nationally recognized accounting firm as may be designated by the Executive (the
"Accounting Firm") which shall provide detailed supporting calculations both to the Company and the Executive within 15 business days of the receipt of notice from the Executive that there has been a
Payment, or such earlier time as is requested by the Company. In the event that the Accounting Firm is serving as accountant or auditor for the individual, entity or group effecting the change in
control, the Executive shall appoint another nationally recognized accounting firm to make the determinations required hereunder (which accounting firm shall then be referred to as the Accounting Firm
hereunder). All fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne by the Company. Any Gross-Up Payment, as determined pursuant to this Section&nbsp;12, shall be paid by the Company
to the Executive within five days of the receipt of the Accounting Firm's determination. Any determination by the Accounting Firm shall be binding upon the Company and the Executive. As a result of
the uncertainty in the application of Section&nbsp;4999 of the Code at the time of the initial determination by the Accounting Firm hereunder, it is possible that Gross-Up Payments which
will not have been made by the Company should have been made ("Underpayment"), consistent with the calculations required to be made hereunder. In the event that the Company exhausts its remedies
pursuant to this Section&nbsp;12 and the Executive thereafter is required to make a payment of any Excise Tax, the Accounting Firm shall determine the amount of the Underpayment that has occurred
and any such Underpayment shall be promptly paid by the Company to or for the Executive's benefit. </FONT></P>

after-tax basis, from any Excise Tax or income tax (including interest and penalties with respect thereto) imposed as a result of such representation and payment of costs and expense.
Without limitation on the foregoing provisions of this Section&nbsp;12, the Company shall control all proceedings taken in connection with such contest and, at its sole option, may pursue or forego
any and all administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings and conferences with the taxing authority in respect of such claim and may, at its sole option, either direct the Executive to pay the tax
claimed and sue for a refund or contest the claim in any permissible manner, and the Executive agrees to prosecute such contest to a determination before any administrative tribunal, in a court of
initial jurisdiction and in one or more appellate courts, as the Company shall determine; </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>provided, however</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, that if the Company directs the Executive
to pay such claim and sue for a refund, the Company shall advance the amount of such payment to the Executive, on an interest-free basis, and shall indemnify and hold the Executive
harmless, on an after-tax basis, from any Excise Tax or income tax (including interest or penalties with respect thereto) imposed with respect to such advance or with respect to any
imputed income with respect to such advance; and further provided that any extension of the statute of limitations relating to payment of taxes for the Executive's taxable year with respect to which
such contested amount is claimed to be due is limited solely to such contested amount. Furthermore, the Company's control of the contest shall be limited to issues with respect to which a
Gross-Up Payment would be payable
hereunder and the Executive shall be entitled to settle or contest, as the case may be, any other issue raised by the Internal Revenue Service or any other taxing authority. </FONT></P>

after the Executive's receipt of an amount advanced by the Company pursuant to this Section&nbsp;12, the Executive becomes entitled to receive any refund with
respect to such claim, the Executive shall (subject to the Company's complying with the requirements of this Section&nbsp;12) promptly pay to the Company the amount of such refund (together with any
interest paid or credited thereon after taxes applicable thereto). If, after the Executive's receipt of an amount advanced by the Company pursuant to this Section&nbsp;12, a determination is made
that the Executive shall not be entitled to any refund with respect to such claim and the Company does not notify the Executive in writing of its intent to contest such denial of refund prior to the
expiration of 30&nbsp;days after such determination, then such advance shall be forgiven and shall not be required to be repaid and the amount of such advance shall offset, to the extent thereof,
the amount of Gross-Up Payment required to be paid. </FONT></P>

hereunder, the Executive will not, from and after the date hereof until the first anniversary of the termination of the Employment Period (or six months after the termination of the Employment Period
if such termination is as a result of a termination for Good Reason following a Change in Control), (i)&nbsp;directly or indirectly engage in the development, production, marketing or sale of
products that compete (or, upon commercialization, would compete) with products of the Company or any subsidiary being developed (so long as such development has not been abandoned), marketed or sold
at the time of the Executive's termination (such business or activity being hereinafter called a "Competing Business") whether such engagement shall be as an officer, director, owner, employee,
partner, affiliate or other participant in any Competing Business, (ii)&nbsp;assist others in engaging in any Competing Business in the manner described in the foregoing clause&nbsp;(i), or
(iii)&nbsp;induce other employees of the Company or any subsidiary thereof to terminate their employment with the Company or any subsidiary thereof or engage in any Competing Business.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the term "Competing Business"

Company, but nevertheless believes that the Executive has received and will receive sufficient consideration and other benefits, as an employee of the Company and as otherwise provided hereunder, to
justify such restrictions which, in any event (given the education, skills and ability of the Executive), the Executive believes would not prevent the Executive from earning a living. </FONT></P>
