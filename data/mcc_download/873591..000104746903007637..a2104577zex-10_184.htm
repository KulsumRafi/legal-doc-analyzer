<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Settlement Agreement and Amendment to RSV License Agreement (the "Settlement Agreement") is entered into this 16th day of December&nbsp;2002 (the
"Effective Date") by and between MedImmune,&nbsp;Inc. ("MedImmune" or "Licensee"), and the Massachusetts Biologic Laboratories of the University of Massachusetts ("MBL" or "Licensor")
(collectively the "Parties"); </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
reference is made to the RSV License Agreement dated August&nbsp;1, 1989 by and between the Massachusetts Health Research Institute,&nbsp;Inc. ("MHRI"), Pediatric
Pharmaceuticals,&nbsp;Inc. ("PPI") and Molecular Vaccines,&nbsp;Inc. ("MVI"), as amended on September&nbsp;30, 1998 (the "RSV License Agreement"). As
successor-in-interest to MHRI with respect to the RSV License Agreement, MBL is presently the sole Licensor thereunder. As successor-in-interest to PPI
and MVI with respect to the License Agreement, MedImmune is presently the sole Licensee thereunder; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
MedImmune has developed and may hereafter develop monoclonal antibody(ies) that are Royalty Bearing Product (as defined in the RSV License Agreement); and </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
a dispute has arisen between MBL and MedImmune over MedImmune's compliance with its obligations under Section&nbsp;2.5 of the RSV License Agreement to transfer information and
to provide technical assistance with regard to MedImmune's monoclonal antibody(ies) that are Royalty Bearing Product ("Dispute 1"); and </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
a further dispute has arisen between MBL and MedImmune over whether a Distribution Agreement ("Distribution Agreement"), dated December&nbsp;1, 1997, between MedImmune and
Abbott International,&nbsp;Ltd. ("Abbott"), which designates Abbott as the exclusive distributor of Synagis&reg; overseas, constitutes a sub-license under the RSV License
Agreement ("Dispute 2"); and </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
in connection with Dispute 1 and Dispute 2, MedImmune claimed that MBL acted in bad faith under the RSV License Agreement ("Dispute 3"); and </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
MBL and MedImmune have agreed to delete Section&nbsp;2.5 of the RSV License Agreement covering the grant by MedImmune to MBL of a royalty free right and license to make, have
made, use and sell or have sold on its behalf any monoclonal antibody(ies) developed by MedImmune useful in the Field (as defined in the RSV License Agreement) for use within the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts and the State of Maine in consideration of an increased royalty for sales of such monoclonal antibodies in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the State of Maine, as set forth below;
and </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
MBL and MedImmune have mediated the above referenced disputes (the "Mediation"), have previously reached an agreement in principle resolving said disputes, and now wish formally
to memorialize the resolution of their differences and move forward with their cooperative efforts; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW,
THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual benefits to be derived from this Settlement Agreement and the representations, conditions and promises hereinafter contained, the Parties
hereby agree as follows: </FONT></P>

no later than December&nbsp;31, 2002, MedImmune will pay MBL a non-refundable fee of the sum of five million dollars (US$5,000,000) in settlement of Dispute 1 and
Dispute 2.

acknowledges that, under Section&nbsp;4(a) of this Settlement Agreement, it has released any and all claims that the Distribution Agreement, as it exists on the date of this
Settlement Agreement, constitutes a sub-license under the RSV License Agreement. Based upon its review of the Distribution Agreement, MBL agrees that with respect to revenues received by
MedImmune under the Distribution Agreement, as it exists on the date of this Settlement Agreement, MedImmune's royalty obligation to the Licensor shall be governed only by
Section&nbsp;3.1(a)(i)&nbsp;of the RSV License Agreement. Exempted from this provision are the $60&nbsp;million in milestone payments, portions of which MedImmune has received and portions of
which MedImmune has yet to receive, from Abbott under paragraph&nbsp;7 of the Distribution Agreement ("Milestone Payments"). In consideration of the settlement set forth in this Settlement
Agreement, MBL agrees that MedImmune has no financial obligations to the Licensor whatsoever with respect to any and all Milestone Payments that have been previously paid by Abbott to MedImmune, that
are now owed by Abbott to MedImmune, or that might be owed in the future by Abbott to MedImmune, it being understood that MBL's agreement in this regard applies only to the amount of
those Milestone Payments ($60&nbsp;million) as set forth in the Distribution Agreement as of the date of MBL's review of such Distribution Agreement, and that MBL's
agreement in this regard applies to no other past or future payments under the Distribution Agreement.

(paragraph&nbsp;1.10 of the RSV License Agreement) covers future "Royalty Bearing Product" in no way is to be read or interpreted as an acknowledgement or admission by MedImmune that the term
