Contracts to the Trust. Pursuant to Section 2.01 of this Agreement, the Trust
Depositor has assigned, transferred and conveyed to the Issuer as part of the
Trust Corpus its rights under the Transfer and Sale Agreement, including without
limitation, the representations and warranties of the Seller therein as set
forth in EXHIBIT J attached hereto, together with all rights of the Trust
Depositor with respect to any breach thereof including any right to require the
Seller to reacquire any Contract in accordance with the Transfer and Sale
Agreement. It is understood and agreed that the representations and warranties
set forth or referred to in this Section shall survive delivery of the Contract
Files to the Owner Trustee or any custodian.

     The Trust Depositor hereby represents and warrants to the Trust and the
Indenture Trustee that it has entered into the Transfer and Sale Agreement with
the Seller, that the Seller has made the representations and warranties in the
Transfer and Sale Agreement as set forth in EXHIBIT J hereto, that such
representations and warranties run to and are for the benefit of the

                                       26

Trust Depositor, and that pursuant to Section 2.01 of this Agreement the Trust
Depositor has transferred and assigned to the Trust all rights of the Trust
Depositor to cause the Seller under the Transfer and Sale Agreement to reacquire
Contracts in the event of a breach of such representations and warranties.

     SECTION 3.01.  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES REGARDING THE TRUST
DEPOSITOR. By its execution of this Agreement and each Subsequent Transfer
Agreement, the Trust Depositor represents and warrants to the Trust, the
Indenture Trustee and the Noteholders that:

          (a)     ASSUMPTION OF SELLER'S REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. The

     corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
     laws of the jurisdiction of its organization and has the corporate power to
     own its assets and to transact the business in which it is currently
     engaged. The Trust Depositor is duly qualified to do business as a foreign
     corporation and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the
     character of the business transacted by it or properties owned or leased by
     it requires such qualification and in which the failure so to qualify would
     have a material adverse effect on the business, properties, assets, or
     condition (financial or other) of the Trust Depositor or the Trust.

          (c)     AUTHORIZATION; VALID SALE; BINDING OBLIGATIONS. The Trust
     Depositor has the power and authority to make, execute, deliver and perform
     its obligations under this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to
     which it is a party and all of the transactions contemplated under this
     Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which it is a party, and
     to create the Trust and cause it to make, execute, deliver and perform its
     obligations under this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to
     which it is a party and has taken all necessary corporate action to
     authorize the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the
     other Transaction Documents to which it is a party and to cause the Trust
     to be created. This Agreement and the related Subsequent Transfer
     Agreement, if any, shall effect a valid transfer and assignment of the
     Trust Corpus, enforceable against the Trust Depositor and creditors of and
     purchasers from the Trust Depositor. This Agreement and the other
     Transaction Documents to which the Trust Depositor is a party constitute
     the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Trust Depositor enforceable
     in accordance with their terms, except as enforcement of such terms may be
     limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws affecting the enforcement
     of creditors' rights generally and by the availability of equitable
     remedies.

          (d)     NO CONSENT REQUIRED. The Trust Depositor is not required to
     obtain the consent of any other party or any consent, license, approval or
     authorization from, or registration or declaration with, any governmental
     authority, bureau or agency in connection with the execution, delivery,
     performance, validity or enforceability of this Agreement or the other
     Transaction Documents to which it is a party.

<Page>

          (e)     NO VIOLATIONS. The execution, delivery and performance of this
     Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which it is a party by the
     Trust Depositor, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
     hereby and thereby, will not violate any provision of any existing law or
     regulation or any order or decree of any court or of any Federal or state
     regulatory body or administrative agency having jurisdiction over the Trust
     Depositor or any of its properties or the Articles of Incorporation or
     Bylaws of the Trust Depositor, or constitute a material breach of any
     mortgage, indenture, contract or other agreement to which the Trust
     Depositor is a party or by which the Trust Depositor or any of the Trust
     Depositor's properties may be bound, or result in the creation or
     imposition of any security interest, lien, charge, pledge, preference,
     equity or encumbrance of any kind upon any of its properties pursuant to
     the terms of any such mortgage, indenture, contract or other agreement,
     other than as contemplated by the Transaction Documents.

          (f)     LITIGATION. No litigation or administrative proceeding of or
     before any court, tribunal or governmental body is currently pending, or to
     the knowledge of the Trust Depositor threatened, against the Trust
     Depositor or any of its properties or with respect to this Agreement, the
     other Transaction Documents to which it is a party or the Notes (1) which,
     if adversely determined, would in the opinion of the Trust Depositor have a
     material adverse effect on the business, properties, assets or condition
     (financial or otherwise) of the Trust Depositor or the Trust or the
     transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the other Transaction
     Documents to which the Trust Depositor is a party or (2) seeking to
     adversely affect the federal income tax or other federal, state or local
     tax attributes of the Certificate or Notes.

          (g)     STATE OF INCORPORATION; NAME; NO CHANGES. The Trust
     Depositor's state of incorporation is the State of Nevada. The Trust
     Depositor's exact legal name is as set forth in the first paragraph of this
     Agreement. The Trust Depositor has not changed its name, whether by
     amendment of its Articles of Incorporation, by reorganization or otherwise,
     and has not changed the location of its place of business, within the four
     months preceding the Closing Date.

          (h)     SOLVENCY. The Trust Depositor, after giving effect to the
     conveyances made by it hereunder, is Solvent.

Such representations speak as of the execution and delivery of this Agreement
and as of the Closing Date in the case of the Initial Contracts, and as of the
applicable Subsequent Transfer Date in the case of the Subsequent Contracts, but
shall survive the transfer and assignment of the Contracts to the Trust.

     SECTION 3.02.  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES REGARDING THE SERVICER. The
Servicer represents and warrants to the Trust, the Indenture Trustee and the
Noteholders that:

          (a)     ORGANIZATION AND GOOD STANDING. The Servicer is a corporation
     duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
     jurisdiction of its organization and has the corporate power to own its
     assets and to transact the business in which it is currently engaged. The
     Servicer is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is
     in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the character of the
     business transacted by it or properties owned or leased by it requires such
     qualification and in which the failure so to qualify would have a material
     adverse effect on the business, properties, assets, or condition (financial
     or otherwise) of the Servicer or the Trust. The Servicer is properly
     licensed in each jurisdiction to the extent required by the laws of such
     jurisdiction to service the Contracts in accordance with the terms hereof
     other than such licenses the failure to obtain would not have a material
     adverse effect on the business, properties, assets, or condition (financial
     or otherwise) of the Servicer or on the ability of the Servicer to perform
     its obligations hereunder..

          (b)     AUTHORIZATION; BINDING OBLIGATIONS. The Servicer has the power
     and authority to make, execute, deliver and perform this Agreement and the
     other Transaction Documents to which the Servicer is a party and all of the
     transactions contemplated under this Agreement and the other Transaction
     Documents to which the Servicer is a party, and has taken all necessary
     corporate action to authorize the execution, delivery and performance of
     this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which the Servicer is
     a party. This Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which the
     Servicer is a party constitute the legal, valid and binding obligation of
     the Servicer enforceable in accordance with their terms, except as
     enforcement of such terms may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or
     similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and
     by the availability of equitable remedies.

          (c)     NO CONSENT REQUIRED. The Servicer is not required to obtain
     the consent of any other party or any consent, license, approval or
     authorization from, or registration or declaration with, any governmental
     authority, bureau or agency in connection with the execution, delivery,
     performance, validity or enforceability of this Agreement and the other
     Transaction Documents to which the Servicer is a party.

          (d)     NO VIOLATIONS. The execution, delivery and performance of this
     Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which the Servicer is a
     party by the Servicer will not violate any provisions of any existing law
     or regulation or any order or decree of any court or of any Federal or
     state regulatory body or administrative agency having jurisdiction over the
     Servicer or any of its properties or the Articles of Incorporation or
     Bylaws of the Servicer, or constitute a material breach of any mortgage,
     indenture, contract or other agreement to which the Servicer is a party or
     by which the Servicer or any of the Servicer's properties may be bound, or
     result in the creation of or imposition of any security interest, lien,
     pledge, preference, equity or encumbrance of any

                                       29
<Page>

     kind upon any of its properties pursuant to the terms of any such mortgage,
     indenture, contract or other agreement, other than this Agreement.

          (e)     LITIGATION. No litigation or administrative proceeding of or
     before any court, tribunal or governmental body is currently pending, or to
     the knowledge of the Servicer threatened, against the Servicer or any of
     its properties or with respect to this Agreement, any other Transaction
     Document to which the Servicer is a party which, if adversely determined,
     would in the opinion of the Servicer have a material adverse effect on the
     business, properties, assets or condition (financial or otherwise) of the
     Servicer or the Trust or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
     any other Transaction Document to which the Servicer is a party.

           PERFECTION OF TRANSFER AND PROTECTION OF SECURITY INTERESTS

     SECTION 4.01.  CUSTODY OF CONTRACTS. (a) Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Section 4.01, the contents of each Contract File shall be
held in the custody of the Servicer for the benefit of, and as agent for, the
Trust as the owner thereof.

     (b)  The Servicer agrees to maintain the related Contract Files at its
offices where they are currently maintained, or at such other offices of the
Servicer in the State of Nevada as shall from time to time be identified to the
Trustees by written notice. The Servicer may temporarily move individual
Contract Files or any portion thereof without notice as necessary to conduct
collection and other servicing activities in accordance with its customary
practices and procedures; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Servicer will take all
action necessary to maintain the perfection of the Trust's interest in the
Contracts and the proceeds thereof. It is intended that by the Servicer's
agreement pursuant to Section 4.01(a) above and this Section 4.01(b) the
Trustees shall be deemed to have possession of the Contract Files for purposes
of Section 9-313 of the Uniform Commercial Code of the State in which the
Contract Files are located.

     (c)  As custodian, the Servicer shall have the following powers and perform
the following duties:

          (i)     hold the Contract Files on behalf of the Trust, maintain
     accurate records pertaining to each Contract to enable it to comply with
     the terms and conditions of this Agreement, maintain a current inventory
     thereof and certify to the Owner Trustee and the Indenture Trustee annually
     that it continues to maintain possession of such Contract Files;

          (ii)    implement policies and procedures in writing and signed by a
     Servicing Officer with respect to persons authorized to have access to the
     Contract Files on the Servicer's premises and the receipting for Contract
     Files taken from their storage area by an employee of the Servicer for
     purposes of servicing or any other purposes;

                                       30
<Page>

          (iii)   attend to all details in connection with maintaining custody
     of the Contract Files on behalf of the Trust;

          (iv)    at all times maintain the original of the fully executed
     Contract and store such original Contract in a fireproof vault;

          (v)     stamp each Contract on both the first and the signature page
     (if different) as of the Closing Date (or Subsequent Transfer Date, as the
     case may be) in the form attached hereto as EXHIBIT L; and

          (vi)    as promptly as practicable after the Closing Date (or
     Subsequent Transfer Date, as the case may be), and in any event within 60
     days thereof, deliver an Officer's Certificate to the Owner Trustee and the
     Indenture Trustee certifying that as of a date no earlier than the Closing
     Date (or Subsequent Transfer Date, as the case may be) it has conducted an
     inventory of the Contract Files (which in the case of Subsequent Contracts,
     need be only of the Contract Files related to such Subsequent Contracts)
     and that there exists a Contract File for each Contract and stating all
     exceptions to such statement, if any.

     (d)  In performing its duties under this Section 4.01, the Servicer agrees
to act with reasonable care, using that degree of skill and care that it
exercises with respect to similar contracts for the installment purchase of
consumer goods owned and/or serviced by it, and in any event with no less degree
of skill and care than would be exercised by a prudent servicer of motorcycle
conditional sales contracts and promissory note and security agreements. The
Servicer shall promptly report to the Owner Trustee and the Indenture Trustee
any failure by it to hold the Contract Files as herein provided and shall
promptly take appropriate action to remedy any such failure. In acting as
custodian of the Contract Files, the Servicer further agrees not to assert any
legal or beneficial ownership interest in the Contracts or the Contract Files,
except as provided in Section 5.06. The Servicer agrees to indemnify the
Noteholders, the Certificateholder, the Owner Trustee and the Indenture Trustee
for any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, payments, costs, or
expenses of any kind whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted
against the Noteholders, the Certificateholder, the Owner Trustee and the
Indenture Trustee as the result of any act or omission by the Servicer relating
to the maintenance and custody of the Contract Files; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that
the Servicer will not be liable for any portion of any such amount resulting
from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of any Noteholder,
Certificateholder, the Owner Trustee or the Indenture Trustee. The Trustees
shall have no duty to monitor or otherwise oversee the Servicer's performance as
custodian hereunder.

     SECTION 4.02.  FILING. On or prior to the Closing Date, the Servicer shall
cause the UCC financing statement(s) referred to in Section 2.02(g) hereof to be
filed and from time to time the Servicer shall take and cause to be taken such
actions and execute such documents as are necessary or desirable or as the Owner
Trustee or Indenture Trustee may reasonably request to perfect and protect the
Trust's first priority perfected interest in the Trust Corpus against all

                                       31
<Page>

other persons, including, without limitation, the filing of financing
statements, amendments thereto and continuation statements, the execution of
transfer instruments and the making of notations on or taking possession of all
records or documents of title.

     SECTION 4.03.  NAME CHANGE OR RELOCATION. (a) During the term of this
Agreement, neither the Seller nor the Trust Depositor shall change its name,
identity or structure or change its state of incorporation without first giving
at least 30 days' prior written notice to the Owner Trustee and the Indenture
Trustee.

     (b)  If any change in either the Seller's or the Trust Depositor's name,
identity or structure or other action would make any financing or continuation
statement or notice of lien filed under this Agreement seriously misleading
within the meaning of applicable provisions of the UCC or any title statute, the
Servicer, no later than five days after the effective date of such change, shall
file such amendments as may be required to preserve and protect the Trust's
interests in the Trust Corpus and the proceeds thereof. In addition, neither the
Seller nor the Trust Depositor shall change its state of incorporation unless it
has first taken such action as is advisable or necessary to preserve and protect
the Trust's interest in the Trust Corpus. Promptly after taking any of the
foregoing actions, the Servicer shall deliver to the Owner Trustee and the
Indenture Trustee an opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to the Owner
Trustee and the Indenture Trustee stating that, in the opinion of such counsel,
all financing statements or amendments necessary to preserve and protect the
interests of the Trust in the Trust Corpus and the Indenture Trustee in the
Collateral have been filed, and reciting the details of such filing.

     SECTION 4.04.  COSTS AND EXPENSES. The Servicer agrees to pay all
reasonable costs and disbursements in connection with the perfection and the
maintenance of perfection, as against all third parties, of the Trust's right,
title and interest in and to the Contracts (including, without limitation, the
security interest in the Motorcycles granted thereby).

                                  ARTICLE FIVE

                             SERVICING OF CONTRACTS

     SECTION 5.01.  RESPONSIBILITY FOR CONTRACT ADMINISTRATION. The Servicer
will have the sole obligation to manage, administer, service and make
collections on the Contracts and perform or cause to be performed all
contractual and customary undertakings of the holder of the Contracts to the
Obligor. The Owner Trustee, at the written request of a Servicing Officer, shall
furnish the Servicer with any powers of attorney or other documents necessary or
appropriate in the opinion of the Owner Trustee to enable the Servicer to carry
out its servicing and administrative duties hereunder. The Servicer is hereby
appointed the servicer hereunder until such time as any Service Transfer may be
effected under Article VIII.

     SECTION 5.02.  STANDARD OF CARE. In managing, administering, servicing and
making collections on the Contracts pursuant to this Agreement, the Servicer
will exercise that degree of skill and care consistent with the skill and care
that the Servicer exercises with respect to similar

                                       32
<Page>

contracts serviced by the Servicer, and, in any event no less degree of skill
and care than would be exercised by a prudent servicer of motorcycle conditional
sales contracts and promissory note and security agreements; PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
that notwithstanding the foregoing, the Servicer shall not release or waive the
right to collect the unpaid balance of any Contract except that with respect to
a Contract that has become a Defaulted Contract, the Servicer, consistent with
its collection policies, may release or waive the right to collect the unpaid
balance of such Defaulted Contract in an effort to maximize collections thereon.

     SECTION 5.03.  RECORDS. The Servicer shall, during the period it is
servicer hereunder, maintain such books of account and other records as will
enable the Owner Trustee and the Indenture Trustee to determine the status of
each Contract.

     SECTION 5.04.  INSPECTION. (a) At all times during the term hereof, the
Servicer shall afford the Owner Trustee and the Indenture Trustee and their
respective authorized agents reasonable access during normal business hours to
the Servicer's records relating to the Contracts and will cause its personnel to
assist in any examination of such records by the Owner Trustee or the Indenture
Trustee, or such authorized agents and allow copies of the same to be made. The
examination referred to in this Section will be conducted in a manner which does
not unreasonably interfere with the Servicer's normal operations or customer or
employee relations. Without otherwise limiting the scope of the examination the
Owner Trustee or the Indenture Trustee may, using generally accepted audit
procedures, verify the status of each Contract and review the Computer Disk and
records relating thereto for conformity to Monthly Reports prepared pursuant to
Article IX and compliance with the standards represented to exist as to each
Contract in this Agreement.

     (b)  At all times during the term hereof, the Servicer shall keep available
a copy of the List of Contracts at its principal executive office for inspection
by the Trustees.

     SECTION 5.05.  TRUST ACCOUNTS. (a) On or before the Closing Date, the Trust
Depositor shall establish the Collection Account, Note Distribution Account,
Pre-Funding Account and Reserve Fund, each with and in the name of the Indenture
Trustee for the benefit of the Noteholders. The Indenture Trustee is hereby
required to ensure that each of the Trust Accounts is established and maintained
as an Eligible Account.

     (b)  The Indenture Trustee shall deposit (or the Servicer shall deposit,
with respect to payments by or on behalf of the Obligors received directly by
the Servicer), without deposit into any intervening account, into the Collection
Account as promptly as practical (but in any case not later than the second
Business Day following the receipt thereof):

          (i)     With respect to principal and interest on the Contracts
     received on or after the Initial Cutoff Date or Subsequent Cutoff Date, as
     applicable (which for the purpose of this paragraph (b)(i) shall include
     those monies in the Lockbox Account allocable to principal and interest on
     the Contracts), all such amounts received by the Owner Trustee or Servicer;

                                       33
<Page>

          (ii)    All Net Liquidation Proceeds related to the Contracts;

          (iii)   The aggregate of the Reacquisition Prices for Contracts
     reacquired by the Trust Depositor as described in Section 7.08;

          (iv)    All Advances made by the Servicer pursuant to Section 7.03(a);

          (v)     All amounts paid by the Trust Depositor in connection with an
     optional reacquisition of the Contracts described in Section 7.10;

          (vi)    All amounts realized in respect of Carrying Charges
     transferred from the Interest Reserve Account as contemplated in Section
     7.03(b); and

          (vii)   All amounts received in respect of interest, dividends, gains,
     income and earnings on investments of funds in the Trust Accounts (except
     the Reserve Fund and the Pre-Funding Account) as contemplated herein.

     (c)  The Indenture Trustee shall, if amounts remain on deposit in the
Pre-Funding Account at the expiration of the Funding Period, make a demand,
immediately upon expiration of the Funding Period, upon the Trust Depositor to
cause to be deposited into the Collection Account the amount then in deposit in
the Pre-Funding Account.

     (d)  If the Servicer so directs, in writing, the Indenture Trustee shall
invest the amounts in the Trust Accounts in Qualified Eligible Investments that
are payable on demand or that mature not later than one Business Day prior to
the next succeeding Distribution Date. Once such funds are invested, the
Indenture Trustee shall not change the investment of such funds. Any loss on
such investments shall be deposited in the applicable Trust Account by the
Servicer out of its own funds immediately as realized. Funds in the Trust
Accounts not so invested must be insured to the extent permitted by law by the
Bank Insurance Fund or the Savings Association Insurance Fund of the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation. Subject to the restrictions herein, the Indenture
Trustee may purchase a Qualified Eligible Investment from itself or an
Affiliate. Subject to the other provisions hereof, the Indenture Trustee shall
have sole control over each such investment and the income thereon, and any
certificate or other instrument evidencing any such investment, if any, shall be
delivered directly to the Indenture Trustee or its agent, together with each
document of transfer, if any, necessary to transfer title to such investment to
the Indenture Trustee in a manner which complies with this Section 5.05(d). All
interest, dividends, gains upon sale and other income from, or earnings on,
investments of funds in the Trust Accounts (other than the Reserve Fund and the
Pre-Funding Account) shall be deposited in the Collection Account pursuant to
Section 5.05(b) and distributed on the next Distribution Date pursuant to
Section 7.05. The Trust Depositor and the Trust agree and acknowledge that the
Indenture Trustee is to have "CONTROL" (within the meaning of Section 9-106 of
the UCC) of collateral comprised of "INVESTMENT PROPERTY" (within the meaning of
Section 9-102 of the UCC) for all purposes of this Agreement.

                                       34
<Page>

     (e)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Servicer may
remit payments on the Contracts and Net Liquidation Proceeds to the Collection
Account in next-day funds or immediately available funds no later than 10:00
a.m., Central time, on the Business Day prior to the next succeeding
Distribution Date, but only for so long as (i) the short-term debt security
rating of the Servicer is at least "P-1" by Moody's and "A-1+" by Standard &
Poor's or (ii) the long-term debt security rating of the Servicer is at least
"A2" by Moody's and "A" by Standard & Poor's.

     (f)  The Servicer shall apply collections received in respect of a Contract
as follows:

          (i)     First, to accrued interest with respect to such Contract;

          (ii)    Second, to pay any expenses and unpaid late charges or
extension fees (if any) due and owing under such Contract; and

          (iii)   Third, to principal to the extent due and owing under such
Contract.

     (g)  Any collections on a Contract remaining after application by the
Servicer in accordance with the provisions of Section 5.05(f) shall constitute
an excess payment (an "EXCESS PAYMENT"). Excess Payments constituting
prepayments of principal shall be applied as a prepayment of the Principal
Balance of such Contract. All other Excess Payments shall be permitted to be
retained by the Servicer.

     (h)  The Servicer will, from time to time as provided herein, be permitted
to withdraw or request the withdrawal from the Collection Account any amount
deposited therein that, based on the Servicer's good-faith determination, was
deposited in error.

     SECTION 5.06.  ENFORCEMENT. (a) The Servicer will, consistent with Section
5.02, act with respect to the Contracts in such manner as will maximize the
receipt of all payments called for under the terms of the Contracts. The
Servicer shall use its best efforts to cause Obligors to make all payments on
the Contracts directly to the Lockbox Account. The Servicer will act in a
commercially reasonable manner with respect to the repossession and disposition
of a Motorcycle following a default under the related Contract with a view to
realizing proceeds at least equal to the Motorcycle's fair market value. If the
Servicer determines that eventual payment in full of a Contract is unlikely, the
Servicer will follow its normal practices and procedures to recover all amounts
due upon that Contract, including repossessing and disposing of the related
Motorcycle at a public or private sale or taking other action permitted by
applicable law. The Servicer will be entitled to recover all reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by it in liquidating a Contract and disposing of
the related Motorcycle.

     (b)  The Servicer may sue to enforce or collect upon Contracts, in its own
name, if possible, or as agent for the Trustees. If the Servicer elects to
commence a legal proceeding to enforce a Contract, the act of commencement shall
be deemed to be an automatic assignment of the Contract to the Servicer for
purposes of collection only. If, however, in any enforcement suit or legal
proceeding it is held that the Servicer may not enforce a Contract on the ground
that it is

                                       35
<Page>

not a real party in interest or a holder entitled to enforce the Contract, the
Owner Trustee (or the Indenture Trustee) on behalf of the Trust shall, at the
Servicer's expense, take such steps as the Servicer deems reasonably necessary
to enforce the Contract, including bringing suit in its name or the names of the
Noteholders under the Indenture and the Certificateholder as owner of the Trust.

     (c)  The Servicer shall exercise any rights of recourse against third
persons that exist with respect to any Contract in accordance with the
Servicer's usual practice. In exercising recourse rights, the Servicer is
authorized on the Trust's behalf to reassign the Defaulted Contract or the
related Motorcycle to the Person against whom recourse exists at the price set
forth in the document creating the recourse; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, the Servicer in
exercising recourse against any third persons as described in the immediately
preceding sentence shall do so in such manner as to maximize the aggregate
recovery with respect to the Contract; and PROVIDED FURTHER, HOWEVER, that
notwithstanding the foregoing the Servicer in its capacity as such may exercise
such recourse only if such Contract (i) was not required to be reacquired by the
Seller pursuant to the Transfer and Sale Agreement or (ii) was required to be
reacquired by the Seller and the Seller has defaulted on such reacquisition
obligation.

     (d)  The Servicer will not permit any rescission or cancellation of any
Contract due to the acts or omissions of the Trust Depositor.

     (e)  The Servicer may grant to the Obligor on any Contract an extension of
payments due under such Contract; PROVIDED that (i) the extension period is
limited to 45 days, (ii) the Obligor has not received an extension during the
previous twelve-month period, (iii) the evidence supports the Obligor's
willingness and capability to resume monthly payments, (iv) such extension is
consistent with the Servicer's customary servicing procedures and is consistent
with Section 5.02, (v) such extension does not extend the maturity date of the
Contract beyond the latest maturity date of any of the Contracts as of the
Initial Cutoff Date (or, if a transfer of Subsequent Contracts to the Trust
occurs, beyond the latest maturity date of such Subsequent Contracts) and (vi)
the aggregate Principal Balances of Contracts which have had extensions granted
does not exceed more than 3.00% of the aggregate of the Initial Class A-1 Note
Balance, the Initial Class A-2 Note Balance and the Initial Class B Note
Balance.

     (f)  The Servicer will not add to the outstanding Principal Balance of any
Contract the premium of any physical damage or other individual insurance on a
Motorcycle securing such Contract it obtains on behalf of the Obligor under the
terms of such Contract, but may create a separate Obligor obligation with
respect to such premium if and as provided by the Contract.

     (g)  If the Servicer shall have repossessed a Motorcycle on behalf of the
Trust, the Servicer shall either (i) maintain at its expense physical damage
insurance with respect to such Motorcycle, or (ii) indemnify the Trust against
any damage to such Motorcycle prior to resale or other disposition. The Servicer
shall not allow such repossessed Motorcycles to be used in an active trade or
business, but rather shall dispose of the Motorcycle in a reasonable time in
accordance with the Servicer's normal business practices.

                                       36

     SECTION 5.07.  TRUSTEES TO COOPERATE. Upon payment in full on any Contract,
the Servicer will notify the Trustees and the Trust Depositor on the next
succeeding Distribution Date by certification of a Servicing Officer (which
certification shall include a statement to the effect that all amounts received
in connection with such payments which are required to be deposited in the
Collection Account pursuant to Section 5.05 have been so deposited) and shall
(if the Servicer is not then in possession of the Contracts and Contract Files)
request delivery of the Contract and Contract File to the Servicer. Upon receipt
of such delivery and request, the Trustees shall promptly release or cause to be
released such Contract and Contract File to the Servicer. Upon receipt of such
Contract and Contract File, each of the Trust Depositor and the Servicer is
authorized to execute an instrument in satisfaction of such Contract and to do
such other acts and execute such other documents as the Servicer deems necessary
to discharge the Obligor thereunder and eliminate the security interest in the
Motorcycle related thereto. The Servicer shall determine when a Contract has
been paid in full; to the extent that insufficient payments are received on a
Contract credited by the Servicer as prepaid or paid in full and satisfied, the
shortfall shall be paid by the Servicer out of its own funds. From time to time
as appropriate for servicing and repossession in connection with any Contract,
if the Servicer is not then in possession of the Contracts and Contract Files,
the Indenture Trustee shall, upon written request of a Servicing Officer and
delivery to the Indenture Trustee of a receipt signed by such Servicing Officer,
cause the original Contract and the related Contract File to be released to the
Servicer and shall execute such documents as the Servicer shall deem reasonably
necessary to the prosecution of any such proceedings. Such receipt shall
obligate the Servicer to return the original Contract and the related Contract
File to the Indenture Trustee when the need by the Servicer has ceased unless
the Contract shall be reacquired as described in Section 7.10. Upon request of a
Servicing Officer, the Indenture Trustee shall perform such other acts as
reasonably requested by the Servicer and otherwise cooperate with the Servicer
in the enforcement of the Certificateholder's rights and remedies with respect
to Contracts.

     SECTION 5.08.  COSTS AND EXPENSES. All costs and expenses incurred by the
Servicer in carrying out its duties hereunder, fees and expenses of accountants
and payments of all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the
enforcement of Contracts (including enforcement of defaulted Contracts and
repossessions of Motorcycles securing such Contracts when such Contracts are not
reacquired pursuant to Section 7.08) and all other fees and expenses not
expressly stated hereunder to be for the account of the Trust shall be paid by
the Servicer and the Servicer shall not be entitled to reimbursement hereunder.

     SECTION 5.09.  MAINTENANCE OF SECURITY INTERESTS IN MOTORCYCLES. The
Servicer shall take such steps as are necessary to maintain continuous
perfection and the first priority of the security interest created by each
Contract in the related Motorcycle. The Owner Trustee and the Indenture Trustee
hereby authorize the Servicer to take such steps as are necessary to perfect
such security interest and to maintain the first priority thereof in the event
of a relocation of a Motorcycle or for any other reason.

     SECTION 5.10.  SUCCESSOR SERVICER/LOCKBOX AGREEMENTS. The Servicer shall
use its best efforts to cause Obligors to make all payments on the Contracts
directly to one or more

                                       37
<Page>

Lockbox Banks, acting as agent for the Trust pursuant to a Lockbox Agreement. In
the event the Servicer shall for any reason no longer be acting as such, the
Successor Servicer shall thereupon assume all of the rights and obligations of
the outgoing servicer under the Lockbox Agreement; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the
Successor Servicer shall not be liable for any acts or obligations of the
Servicer prior to such succession. In such event, the Successor Servicer shall
be deemed to have assumed all of the outgoing Servicer's interest therein and to
have replaced the outgoing Servicer as a party to each such Lockbox Agreement to
the same extent as if such Lockbox Agreement had been assigned to the Successor
Servicer, except that the outgoing Servicer shall not thereby be relieved of any
liability or obligations on the part of the outgoing Servicer to the Lockbox
Bank under such Lockbox Agreement. The outgoing Servicer shall, upon the request
of the Owner Trustee, but at the expense of the outgoing Servicer, deliver to
the Successor Servicer all documents and records relating to each such Lockbox
Agreement and an accounting of amounts collected and held by the Lockbox Bank
and otherwise use its best efforts to effect the orderly and efficient transfer
of any Lockbox Agreement to the Successor Servicer.

     SECTION 5.11.  SEPARATE ENTITY EXISTENCE. The Servicer agrees to take or
refrain from taking or engaging in with respect to the Trust Depositor, as
applicable, each of the actions or activities specified in the "substantive
consolidation" opinion of Winston & Strawn (or in any related Certificate of the
Servicer) delivered on the Closing Date, upon which the conclusions expressed
therein are based.

                                   ARTICLE SIX

                               THE TRUST DEPOSITOR

     SECTION 6.01.  COVENANTS OF THE TRUST DEPOSITOR.

          (a)     During the term of this Agreement, the Trust Depositor will
keep in full force and effect its existence, rights and franchises as a

obtain and preserve its qualification to do business in each jurisdiction in
which such qualification is or shall be necessary to protect the validity and

instrument or agreement necessary or appropriate to the proper administration of
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

business other than financing, purchasing, owning, selling and managing the
Contracts in the manner contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents and activities incidental thereto; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Trust
Depositor may purchase and transfer (or grant Liens in respect of) contracts
and/or other related assets similar to the Contracts to other Persons in

                                       38
<Page>

securitization or other non-recourse financing transactions involving the Seller
or any of its Affiliates (or with respect to the Contract Assets themselves,
following a release and reconveyance thereof from the Trust), on terms and
conditions (with respect to the liabilities imposed upon the Trust Depositor by
virtue of such transactions, as well as in respect of agreements or restrictions
concerning activities of the Trust Depositor and its relations or interactions
with the Seller or the Servicer or other applicable Affiliate relevant to
"bankruptcy remoteness" or "substantive consolidation" analysis), in each case
substantially similar to such terms and conditions applicable to the Trust
Depositor hereunder and under the other Transaction Documents.

          (d)     NO BORROWING. The Trust Depositor shall not issue, incur,
assume, guarantee or otherwise become liable, directly or indirectly, for (i)
any Indebtedness except for any Indebtedness permitted by or arising under the
Transaction Documents or (ii) obligations in connection with transactions
described in the proviso of Section 6.01(c), as limited thereby. The proceeds of
the Notes shall be used exclusively to fund the Trust Depositor's purchase of
the Contracts and the other assets specified in this Agreement and to pay the
transactional expenses of the Trust Depositor.

          (e)     GUARANTEES, LOANS ADVANCES AND OTHER LIABILITIES. Except as
otherwise contemplated by the Transaction Documents or in connection with
transactions described in Section 6.01(c), as limited thereby, the Trust
Depositor shall not make any loan or advance or credit to, or guarantee
(directly or indirectly or by an instrument having the effect of assuming
another's payment or performance on any obligation or capability of so doing or
otherwise), endorse or otherwise become contingently liable, directly or
indirectly, in connection with the obligations, stocks or dividends of, or own,
purchase, repurchase or acquire (or agree contingently to do so) any stock,
obligations, assets or securities of, any other interest in, or make any capital
contribution to, any other Person.

          (f)     CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. The Trust Depositor shall not make any
expenditure (by long-term or operating lease or otherwise) for capital assets
(either realty or personalty).

          (g)     RESTRICTED PAYMENTS. Except as permitted or contemplated by
the Transaction Documents, the Trust Depositor shall not, directly or
indirectly, (i) pay any dividend or make any distribution (by reduction of
capital or otherwise), whether in cash, property, securities or a combination
thereof, to any owner of an equity interest in the Trust Depositor, (ii) redeem,
purchase, retire or otherwise acquire for value any such equity interest or
(iii) set aside or otherwise segregate any amounts for any such purpose; it
being understood that the Trust Depositor shall at all times have the right to
distribute funds received pursuant to the Transaction Documents to its equity
owner.

          (h)     SEPARATE ENTITY EXISTENCE. The Trust Depositor shall:

                                       39
<Page>

                  (i)    Maintain its own deposit account or accounts, separate
     from those of any Affiliate, with commercial banking institutions. The
     funds of the Trust Depositor will not be diverted to any other Person or
     for other than authorized uses of the Trust Depositor.

                  (ii)   Ensure that, to the extent that it shares the same
     officers or other employees as any of its members or Affiliates, the
     salaries of and the expenses related to providing benefits to such officers
     and other employees shall be fairly allocated among such entities, and each
     such entity shall bear its fair share of the salary and benefit costs
     associated with all such common officers and employees.

                  (iii)  Ensure that, to the extent that it jointly contracts
     with any of its members or Affiliates to do business with vendors or
     service providers or to share overhead expenses, the costs incurred in so
     doing shall be allocated fairly among such entities, and each such entity
     shall bear its fair share of such costs. To the extent that the Trust
     Depositor contracts or does business with vendors or service providers when
     the goods and services provided are partially for the benefit of any other
     Person, the costs incurred in so doing shall be fairly allocated to or
     among such entities for whose benefit the goods and services are provided,
     and each such entity shall bear its fair share of such costs. All material
     transactions between Trust Depositor and any of its Affiliates shall be
     only on an arm's length basis.

                  (iv)   To the extent that the Trust Depositor and any of its
     members or Affiliates have offices in the same location, there shall be a
     fair and appropriate allocation of overhead costs among them, and each such
     entity shall bear its fair share of such expenses.

                  (v)    Conduct its affairs strictly in accordance with its
     By-laws and Articles of Incorporation, and observe all necessary,
     appropriate and customary limited liability company formalities, including,
     but not limited to, holding all regular and special members' and directors'
     meetings appropriate to authorize all entity action, keeping separate and
     accurate records of such meetings and its actions, passing all resolutions
     or consents necessary to authorize actions taken or to be taken, and
     maintaining accurate and separate books, records and accounts, including,
     but not limited to, payroll and intercompany transaction accounts.

                  (vi)   Take or refrain from taking or engaging in, as
     applicable, each of the actions or activities specified in the "true sale"
     and "substantive consolidation" opinions of Winston & Strawn delivered on
     the Closing Date (or in any related certificate delivered in connection
     therewith), upon which the conclusions expressed therein are based.

     SECTION 6.02.  LIABILITY OF TRUST DEPOSITOR; INDEMNITIES. The Trust
Depositor shall be liable in accordance herewith only to the extent of the
obligations specifically undertaken by the Trust Depositor under this Agreement.

     The Trust Depositor shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Issuer,
the Owner Trustee, WTC, the Indenture Trustee and the Servicer from and against
any taxes that may at any time be asserted against any such Person with respect
to the transactions contemplated herein and in the other Transaction Documents,
including any sales, gross receipts, general corporation, tangible personal
property, Illinois personal property replacement privilege or license taxes
(but, in the case of the Issuer, not including any taxes asserted with respect
to, and as of the date of, the transfer of the Contracts to the Issuer or the
issuance and original sale of the Securities, or asserted with respect to
ownership of the Contracts, or federal or other income taxes arising out of
distributions on the Certificate or the Notes) and costs and expenses in
defending against the same.

     The Trust Depositor shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Issuer,
the Owner Trustee, WTC, the Indenture Trustee and the Securityholders from and
against any loss, liability or expense incurred by reason of the Trust
Depositor's willful misfeasance, bad faith or negligence (other than errors in
judgment) in the performance of its duties under this Agreement, or by reason of
reckless disregard of its obligations and duties under this Agreement.

     The Trust Depositor shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Issuer,
the Owner Trustee, WTC and the Indenture Trustee from and against all costs,
expenses, losses, claims, damages and liabilities arising out of or incurred in
connection with the acceptance or performance of the trusts and duties herein
and, in the case of the Owner Trustee, in the Trust Agreement and, in the case
of the Indenture Trustee, in the Indenture, except to the extent that such cost,
expense, loss, claim, damage or liability in the case of (i) the Owner Trustee
or WTC, as the case may be, shall be due to the willful misfeasance, bad faith
or negligence of the Owner Trustee or WTC, as the case may be, or shall arise
from the breach by the Owner Trustee or WTC, as the case may be, of any of its
representations or warranties set forth in Section 7.03 of the Trust Agreement,
or (ii) the Indenture Trustee, shall be due to the willful misfeasance, bad
faith or negligence of the Indenture Trustee.

     The Trust Depositor shall be liable directly to and will indemnify any
injured party or any other creditor of the Trust for all losses, claims,
damages, liabilities and expenses of the Trust to the extent that Trust
Depositor would be liable if the Trust were a partnership under the Delaware
Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act in which Trust Depositor were a general
partner; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that Trust Depositor shall not be liable for any
losses incurred by a Certificateholder in the capacity of an investor in the
Trust Certificate or a Noteholder in the capacity of an investor in the Notes.
In addition, any third party creditors of the Trust (other than in connection
with the obligations described in the immediately preceding sentence for which
Trust Depositor shall not be liable) shall be deemed third party beneficiaries
of this paragraph. The obligations of Trust Depositor under this paragraph shall
be evidenced by the Trust Certificate described in the Trust Agreement.

                                       41
<Page>

     Indemnification under this Section shall include, without limitation,
reasonable fees and expenses of counsel and expenses of litigation and shall
survive the termination of the Trust and the resignation or removal of the
Trustees. If the Trust Depositor shall have made any indemnity payments pursuant
to this Section and the Person to or on behalf of whom such payments are made
thereafter shall collect any of such amounts from others, such Person shall
promptly repay such amounts to the Trust Depositor, without interest.

     Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the obligations of the
Trust Depositor under this Section are solely the corporate obligations of the
Trust Depositor and shall be payable by it solely as provided in this Section.
The Trust Depositor shall only be required to make such contributions required
under this Section, (y) from funds available to it pursuant to, and in
accordance with the payment priorities set forth in Section 7.05 and (z) only to
the extent that it receives additional funds designated for such purposes or to
the extent that it has additional funds available (other than funds described in
the preceding clause (y)) that would be in excess of amounts that would be
necessary to pay the debt and other obligations of such entity incurred in
accordance with its certificate of incorporation and all financing documents to
which it is a party as they come due. In addition,, no amount owing by the Trust
Depositor hereunder in excess of the liabilities that it is required to pay in
accordance with the preceding sentence shall constitute a "claim" (as defined in
Section 101(5) of the Bankruptcy Code) against it. No recourse shall be had for
the payment of any amount owing hereunder or any other obligation of, or claim
against the Trust Depositor arising out of or based up on this Section against
any stockholder, employee, officer, agent, director or authorized person of the
Trust Depositor or Affiliate thereof; provided, however, that the foregoing
shall not relieve any such person or entity of any liability they might
otherwise have as a result of fraudulent actions or omissions taken by them.

     SECTION 6.03.  MERGER OR CONSOLIDATION OF, OR ASSUMPTION OF THE OBLIGATIONS
OF, TRUST DEPOSITOR; CERTAIN LIMITATIONS. Notwithstanding any other provision in
this Section and any provision of law, the Trust Depositor shall not do any of
the following:

          (a)     engage in any business or activity other than as set forth in
     its Articles of Incorporation;

          (b)     without the affirmative vote of a majority of the members of
     the Board of Directors of the Trust Depositor (which must include the
     affirmative vote of at least two duly appointed Independent directors) (i)
     dissolve or liquidate, in whole or in part, or institute proceedings to be
     adjudicated bankrupt or insolvent, (ii) consent to the institution of
     bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings against it, (iii) file a petition
     seeking or consent to reorganization or relief under any applicable federal
     or state law relating to bankruptcy, (iv) consent to the appointment of a
     receiver, liquidator, assignee, trustee, sequestrator (or other similar
     official) of the corporation or a substantial part of its property, (v)
     make a general assignment for the benefit of creditors, (vi) admit in
     writing its inability to pay its debts generally as they become due, or
     (vii) take any corporate action in furtherance of the actions set forth in
     clauses (i) through (vi) above; PROVIDED,

                                       42
<Page>

     HOWEVER, that no director may be required by any shareholder of the Trust
     Depositor to consent to the institution of bankruptcy or insolvency
     proceedings against the Trust Depositor so long as it is solvent; or

          (c)     merge or consolidate with any other corporation, company or
     entity or sell all or substantially all of its assets or acquire all or
     substantially all of the assets or capital stock or other ownership
     interest of any other corporation, company or entity unless the Person
     formed by such consolidation or into which the Trust Depositor has merged
     or the Person which acquires by conveyance, transfer or lease substantially
     all the assets of the Trust Depositor as an entirety, can lawfully perform
     the obligations of the Trust Depositor hereunder and executes and delivers
     to the Owner Trustee and the Indenture Trustee an agreement in form and
     substance reasonably satisfactory to the Owner Trustee and the Indenture
     Trustee which contains an assumption by such successor entity of the due
     and punctual performance and observance of each covenant and condition to
     be performed or observed by the Trust Depositor under this Agreement;
     PROVIDED that the Trust Depositor shall provide notice of any merger,
     consolidation or succession pursuant to this Section to each Rating Agency
     and shall receive from each Rating Agency a letter to the effect that such
     merger, consolidation or succession will not result in a qualification,
     downgrading or withdrawal of the then-current ratings of each Class of
     Notes.

     SECTION 6.04.  LIMITATION ON LIABILITY OF TRUST DEPOSITOR AND OTHERS. The
Trust Depositor and any director or officer or employee or agent of the Trust
Depositor may rely in good faith on any document of any kind, prima facie
properly executed and submitted by any Person respecting any matters arising
hereunder. The Trust Depositor and any director or officer or employee or agent
of the Trust Depositor shall be reimbursed by the Owner Trustee or the Indenture
Trustee, as the case may be, for any contractual damages, liability or expense
incurred by reason of the Owner Trustee's or the Indenture Trustee's willful
misfeasance, bad faith or negligence (except errors in judgment) in the
performance of their respective duties hereunder, or by reason of reckless
disregard of their respective obligations and duties hereunder. The Trust
Depositor shall not be under any obligation to appear in, prosecute or defend
any legal action that shall not be incidental to its obligations under this
Agreement, and that in its opinion may involve it in any expense or liability.

     SECTION 6.05.  TRUST DEPOSITOR NOT TO RESIGN. Subject to the provisions of
Section 6.03, the Trust Depositor shall not resign from the obligations and
duties hereby imposed on it as Trust Depositor hereunder.

                           DISTRIBUTIONS; RESERVE FUND

     SECTION 7.01.  MONTHLY DISTRIBUTIONS. (a) Each Noteholder and
Certificateholder as of the related Record Date shall be paid on the next
succeeding Distribution Date by check mailed to such Noteholder or
Certificateholder at the address for such Noteholder or Certificateholder
appearing on the Note Register or Certificate Register or by wire transfer if
such Noteholder or Certificateholder provides written instructions to the
Indenture Trustee or the Owner Trustee, respectively, at least ten days prior to
such Distribution Date.

     (b)  The Indenture Trustee shall serve as the paying agent hereunder (the
"PAYING AGENT") and shall make the payments to or on behalf of the Noteholders
and the Certificateholder required hereunder. The Indenture Trustee hereby
agrees that all amounts held by it for payment hereunder will be held in trust
for the benefit of the Noteholders and the Certificateholder.

     SECTION 7.02.  FEES. The Indenture Trustee shall be paid the Indenture
Trustee Fee and the Servicer shall be paid the Monthly Servicing Fee, each of
which shall be paid solely from the monies and in accordance with the priorities
described in Section 7.05(a). No recourse may be had to the Seller, Trust
Depositor, Trustees, Servicer, or any of their respective Affiliates in the
event that amounts available under Section 7.05(a) are insufficient for payment
of the Indenture Trustee's Fee and the Monthly Servicing Fee.

     SECTION 7.03.  ADVANCES; REALIZATION OF CARRYING CHARGE. (a) On each
Determination Date, the Servicer shall compute the amount of Delinquent
Interest, if any, on the Contracts for the immediately preceding Due Period. Not
later than each Distribution Date, the Servicer shall advance (each, an
"ADVANCE") an amount equal to the Delinquent Interest for such Determination
Date by depositing such amount in the Collection Account; PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
that the Servicer shall be obligated to advance Delinquent Interest only to the
extent that the Servicer, in its sole discretion, expects that such advance will
not become an Uncollectible Advance. The Servicer shall indicate on each Monthly
Report (i) the amount of Delinquent Interest, if any, on the Contracts for the
related Due Period and (ii) the amount of the Advance, if any, made by the
Servicer in respect of the Delinquent Interest pursuant to this Section 7.03. If
the amount of such Advance is less than the amount of the Delinquent Interest,
the relevant Monthly Report shall be accompanied by a certificate of a Servicing
Officer setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for the determination by
the Servicer that the portion of the Delinquent Interest not advanced would
become an Uncollectible Advance. By each Determination Date, the Servicer shall
determine the amount of prior unreimbursed Advances for which it shall be
entitled to be reimbursed pursuant to the provisions of this Section (such
amount, the "REIMBURSEMENT AMOUNT"). The Servicer shall be entitled to be
reimbursed for any outstanding Advance with respect to a Contract by means of a
first priority withdrawal from the Collection Account of such Reimbursement
Amount as provided in Section 7.05(a)(ii).

                                       44

     (b)  The Servicer shall determine no later than 12:00 noon, New York City
time, on the second Business Day prior to a Distribution Date the Carrying
Charges in respect of the upcoming Distribution Date. To the extent of such
amount, the Indenture Trustee shall transfer an amount equal to the Carrying
Charges from the Interest Reserve Account (solely to the extent of the amount
then on deposit) into the Collection Account as contemplated in Section
5.05(b)(vi) hereof.

     SECTION 7.04.  INTEREST RESERVE ACCOUNT.

     (a)  On or prior to the Closing Date, the Trust Depositor shall establish
with and in the name of the Indenture Trustee on behalf of the Securityholders,
an Eligible Account designated "HARLEY-DAVIDSON CUSTOMER FUNDING CORP. INTEREST
RESERVE ACCOUNT - HARLEY DAVIDSON MOTORCYCLE TRUST 2003-1 - BNY MIDWEST TRUST
COMPANY, AS INDENTURE TRUSTEE" (such account being the "Interest Reserve

          basis of the Note Interest Distributable Amount for each such Class of

          (ii)    to the Note Distribution Account, together with any amounts

     distribution of interest to each Class of Notes shall be allocated in the
     following order of priority:

                  (1)    to the Class A Notes, PRO RATA (based on outstanding
          principal amount), until the outstanding principal balance of each
          Class of the Class A Notes has been reduced to zero; and

     HOWEVER, that if there are insufficient funds on deposit in the Note
     Distribution Account to pay the entire amount of the Note Interest
     Distributable Amount for each such Class of Notes, then the amount in the
     Note Distribution Account shall be applied to the Class A-1 Notes and the
     Class A-2 Notes PRO RATA (on the basis of the Note Interest Distributable
     Amount for each such Class);

                                       47

     SECTION 7.06.  RESERVE FUND.

     (a)  On or prior to the Closing Date, the Indenture Trustee, on behalf of
the Trust Depositor shall deposit the Reserve Fund Initial Deposit into the
Reserve Fund from the net proceeds of the Securities.

     (b)  The Indenture Trustee shall determine no later than 10:00 a.m.,
Chicago, Illinois time, on the Distribution Date (but after making, and taking
into account, the determination, demand and transfer of funds contemplated in
Section 7.05 above) whether there exists a Shortfall with respect to the
upcoming Distribution Date. In the event that the Indenture Trustee determines
that there exists a Shortfall, the Indenture Trustee shall no later than 12:00
noon, Chicago, Illinois time, on such Distribution Date remit monies from the
Reserve Fund in the following order of priority: first, to the Note Distribution
Account, the amount of such Shortfall relating to the Note Interest
Distributable Amount and second, to the Note Distribution Account, the amount of
such Shortfall relating to the Note Principal Distributable Amount.

     (c)  The Indenture Trustee shall at the written direction of the Servicer
invest the funds in the Reserve Fund in Qualified Eligible Investments. Funds in
the Reserve Fund shall be invested in investments that are payable on demand or
mature on or before the Business Day prior to each Distribution Date. Once such
funds are invested, the Indenture Trustee shall not change the investment of
such funds prior to maturity. Upon any such investment, the Indenture Trustee
shall, consistent with the definition of Qualified Eligible Investment herein,
make an

                                       48
<Page>

appropriate notation of the security interest in such Qualified Eligible
Investment on the Indenture Trustee's records, by book entry or otherwise. All
income and gain realized from any such investments as well as any interest
earned on Reserve Fund Deposits shall be deposited and retained in the Reserve
Fund (subject to Section 7.06(e)). Losses, if any, realized on amounts in the
Reserve Fund invested pursuant to this paragraph shall first be credited against
undistributed investment earnings on amounts in the Reserve Fund invested
pursuant to this paragraph, and shall thereafter be deemed to reduce the amount
on deposit in the Reserve Fund. Neither the Trust Depositor nor the Indenture
Trustee shall be liable for the amount of any loss incurred in respect of any
investment, or lack of investment, of funds held in the Reserve Fund. All income
or loss on funds held in the Reserve Fund shall be taxable to the Trust
Depositor.

     (d)  Any Excess Amounts will be applied to the Specified Reserve Fund
Balance.

     (e)  On each Distribution Date on which the amount on deposit in the
Reserve Fund (after giving effect to all deposits thereto and withdrawals
therefrom on such Distribution Date) is greater than the Specified Reserve Fund
Balance, the Indenture Trustee shall release its lien on any remaining amounts
to the Trust Depositor.

     SECTION 7.07.  ESTABLISHMENT OF PRE-FUNDING ACCOUNT.

     (a)  On or prior to the Closing Date, the Trust Depositor shall establish
with and in the name of the Indenture Trustee on behalf of the Securityholders,
an Eligible Account designated "HARLEY-DAVIDSON CUSTOMER FUNDING CORP.
PRE-FUNDING ACCOUNT - HARLEY DAVIDSON MOTORCYCLE TRUST 2003-1 - BNY MIDWEST
TRUST COMPANY, AS INDENTURE TRUSTEE" (such account being the "Pre-Funding
Account").

     (b)  During the Funding Period, following receipt from the Trust Depositor
of an Addition Notice, and upon further receipt of a written demand from the
Trust Depositor for a disbursement of funds from the Pre-Funding Account to be
made on or before the date on which the Funding Period terminates (which written
demand must be delivered not later than one Business Day prior to the requested
date of funding and must be accompanied by the written consent of the Indenture
Trustee), the Indenture Trustee will disburse the amount demanded from the
Pre-Funding Account to Harley-Davidson Credit upon the order of the Trust
Depositor for the purpose of purchasing Subsequent Contracts from
Harley-Davidson Credit pursuant to a Subsequent Purchase Agreement. With respect
to amounts still remaining on deposit in the Pre-Funding Account on the date
upon which the Funding Period ends (and provided a timely written demand for
funding as described above has not been received requesting funding on such
date) the Indenture Trustee shall immediately transfer all funds remaining in
the Pre-Funding Account to the Note Distribution Account.

     (c)  If (x) the Pre-Funded Amount has not been reduced to zero on the
Distribution Date on which the Funding Period ends (or, if the Funding Period
does not end on a Distribution Date, on the first Distribution Date following
the end of the Funding Period) or (y) the Pre-Funded Amount has been reduced to
$150,000 or less on any Determination Date, in either case

                                       49
<Page>

after giving effect to any reductions in the Pre-Funded Amount on such
Distribution Date or Determination Date pursuant to paragraph (a) above, the
Trust Depositor shall instruct the Indenture Trustee to withdraw from the
Pre-Funding Account the Pre-Funded Amount and, in the case of (x), on such
Distribution Date or, in the Determination Date (i) if the Pre-Funded Amount is
less than $150,000, deposit the Pre-Funded Amount in the Note Distribution
Account for payment as principal of the Class A-1 Notes up to the Outstanding
Amount thereof and then for payment of principal of the Class A-2 Notes and
Class B Notes and (ii) if the Pre-Funded Amount is equal to or greater than
$150,000, deposit the Pre-Funded Amount in the Note Distribution Account for
payment as principal of the Notes, pro rata, calculated on the then current
principal balance of each Class of Notes.

     SECTION 7.08.  REACQUISITION OF CONTRACTS FOR BREACH OF REPRESENTATIONS AND
WARRANTIES.

     Upon a discovery by the Servicer, the Trust Depositor or the Trustees of a
breach of a representation or warranty of the Seller as set forth in EXHIBIT J
hereto or as made in any Subsequent Purchase Agreement relating to Subsequent
Contracts that materially adversely affects the Trust's interest in such
Contract (without regard to the benefits of the Reserve Fund), the party
discovering the breach shall give prompt written notice to the other parties;
PROVIDED, that the Trustees shall have no duty or obligation to inquire or to
investigate the breach by the Seller of any of such representations or
warranties. The Seller, as provided in the Transfer and Sale Agreement and in
accordance with this Section 7.08, shall reacquire a Contract at its
Reacquisition Price, two Business Days prior to the first Determination Date
after the Seller becomes aware, or should have become aware, or receives written
notice from the Trustee, the Servicer or the Trust Depositor of any breach of a
representation or warranty of the Seller set forth in Article III of the
Transfer and Sale Agreement that materially and adversely affects such Contract
or the Trust's interest in such Contract and which breach has not been cured;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that with respect to any Contract incorrectly described on
the List of Contracts with respect to unpaid Principal Balance which the Seller
would otherwise be required to reacquire under the Transfer and Sale Agreement,
the Seller may, in lieu of reacquiring such Contract, deposit in the Collection
Account not later than one Business Day after such Determination Date cash in an
amount sufficient to cure such deficiency or discrepancy; and PROVIDED FURTHER
that with respect to a breach of representation or warranty relating to the
Contracts in the aggregate and not to any particular Contract the Seller may
select Contracts (without adverse selection) to reacquire such that had such
Contracts not been included as part of the Trust Corpus there would have been no
breach of such representation or warranty; PROVIDED FURTHER that the failure to
maintain perfection of the security interest in the Motorcycle securing a
Contract in accordance with Section 5.09, shall be deemed to be a breach
materially and adversely affecting the Trust's interest in the Contract or in
the related Contracts. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
the obligation of the Seller under the Transfer and Sale Agreement and described
in this Section 7.08 shall not terminate or be deemed released by any party
hereto upon a Service Transfer pursuant to Article VIII. The reacquisition
obligation described in this Section 7.08 is in no way to be satisfied with
monies in the Reserve Fund.

     SECTION 7.09.  REASSIGNMENT OF REACQUIRED CONTRACTS. Upon receipt by the
Indenture Trustee for deposit in the Collection Account of the Reacquisition
Price as described in Section 7.08 or Section 7.10, and upon receipt of a
certificate of a Servicing Officer in the form attached hereto as EXHIBIT G, the
Indenture Trustee shall release its lien on and the Trust shall assign to the
Seller all of the Trust's right, title and interest in the reacquired Contract
without recourse, representation or warranty, except as to the absence of liens,
charges or encumbrances created by or arising as a result of actions of the
Trustees.

     SECTION 7.10.  SELLER'S REACQUISITION OPTION. As provided in the Transfer
and Sale Agreement, on written notice to the Indenture Trustee at least 20 days
prior to a Distribution Date, and provided that the Pool Balance is then less
than 10% of the Aggregate Principal Balance as of the Closing Date, and provided
a valuation letter is delivered as required in Section 5.02 of the Transfer and
Sale Agreement, the Seller may (but is not required to) reacquire on that
Distribution Date all outstanding Contracts at a price equal to the aggregate
unpaid principal balance of the Notes on the previous Distribution Date plus the
aggregate of the Note Interest Distributable Amount for the current Distribution
Date, the Reimbursement Amount (if any) as well as accrued and unpaid Monthly
Servicing Fees and the Indenture Trustee Fee to the date of such reacquisition.
Such price shall be deposited in the Collection Account not later than one (1)
Business Day before such Distribution Date, against the Owner Trustee's and
Indenture Trustee's release of the Contracts and the Contract Files to the
Seller.

occurred and is continuing and has not been waived pursuant to Section 8.02, (x)
the Required Holders or (y) the Indenture Trustee may, by written notice

authority and power of the Servicer

                                       52
<Page>

under this Agreement, whether with respect to the Contracts, the Contract Files
or otherwise, shall pass to and be vested in the Indenture Trustee (the
"SUCCESSOR SERVICER") pursuant to and under this Section 8.03; and, without
limitation, the Successor Servicer is authorized and empowered to execute and
deliver on behalf of the Servicer, as attorney-in-fact or otherwise, any and all
documents and other instruments, and to do any and all acts or things necessary
or appropriate to effect the purposes of such notice of termination. The

termination of the responsibilities and rights of the Servicer hereunder,
including, without limitation, the transfer to the Successor Servicer for
administration by it of all cash amounts which shall at the time be held by the
Servicer for deposit, or have been deposited by the Servicer, in the Collection

thereafter received with respect to the Contracts. The Servicer shall transfer

relating thereto placed on the Servicer by the terms and provisions hereof, and
the terminated Servicer shall be relieved of such responsibilities, duties and
liabilities arising after such Service Transfer; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that (i) the
Successor Servicer will not assume any obligations of the Servicer described in
Section 8.08 and (ii) the Successor Servicer shall not be liable for any acts or
omissions of the Servicer occurring prior to such Service Transfer or for any
breach by the Servicer of any of its representations and warranties contained
herein or in any related document or agreement. Notwithstanding the above, if
the Successor Servicer is legally unable or unwilling to act as Servicer, the
Required Holders may appoint a successor servicer (other than the original
Servicer or an Affiliate of the original Servicer) to act as Servicer. As
compensation therefor, the successor servicer shall be entitled to receive
reasonable compensation equal to the Monthly Servicing Fee. The Owner Trustee,
Noteholders and the Indenture Trustee and such successor shall take such action,
consistent with this Agreement, as shall be necessary to effectuate any such
succession. To the extent the terminated Servicer has made Advances, it shall be
entitled to reimbursement of the same notwithstanding its termination hereunder,
to the same extent as if it had continued to service the Contracts hereunder.

     SECTION 8.05.  NOTIFICATION TO SECURITYHOLDERS. (a) Promptly following the

appearing on the Note Register.

     SECTION 8.06.  EFFECT OF TRANSFER. (a) After a Service Transfer, the
terminated Servicer shall have no further obligations with respect to the
management, administration, servicing, custody or collection of the Contracts
and the Successor Servicer appointed pursuant to Section 8.04 shall have all of
such obligations, except that the terminated Servicer will transmit or cause to
be transmitted directly to the Successor Servicer for its own account, promptly
on receipt and in the same form in which received, any amounts (properly
endorsed where required for the Successor Servicer to collect them) received as
payments upon or otherwise in connection with the Contracts.

     (b)  A Service Transfer shall not affect the rights and duties of the
parties hereunder (including but not limited to the indemnities of the Servicer)
other than those relating to the management, administration, servicing, custody
or collection of the Contracts.

     SECTION 8.07.  DATABASE FILE. The Servicer will provide the Successor

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

     SECTION 11.01. AMENDMENT.

     (a)  This Agreement may be amended by the Trust Depositor, the Servicer,
the Indenture Trustee and the Owner Trustee on behalf of the Issuer,
collectively, without the consent of any Securityholders, (i) to cure any
ambiguity, to correct or supplement any provisions in this Agreement which are
inconsistent with the provisions herein or in the Prospectus, or to add any
other provisions with respect to matters or questions arising under this
Agreement that shall not be inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement
or the Prospectus, (ii) to add or provide any credit enhancement for any Class
of Notes and (iii) to change any provision applicable for determining the
Specified Reserve Fund Balance or the manner in which the Reserve Fund is
funded; PROVIDED, HOWEVER that any such action shall not, as evidenced by an
Opinion of Counsel, adversely affect in any material respect the interests of
any Securityholder and provided, further, that in connection with any amendment
pursuant to clause (iii) above, the Servicer shall deliver to the Owner Trustee
and the Indenture Trustee a letter from Standard & Poor's (so long as Standard &
Poor's is a Rating Agency) and Moody's (so long as Moody's is a Rating Agency)
to the effect that such amendment will not cause its then-current rating on any
Class of Notes to be qualified, reduced or withdrawn.

     (b)  This Agreement may also be amended from time to time by the Trust
Depositor, the Servicer, the Indenture Trustee and the Owner Trustee on behalf
of the Issuer, with the consent of the Required Holders, for the purpose of
adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the
provisions of this Agreement or of modifying in any manner the rights of the
Noteholders or the Certificateholder; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no such amendment
shall increase or reduce in any manner the amount of, or accelerate or delay the
timing of (i)(a) collections of payments on the Contracts or distributions that
shall be required to be made on any Note or any Interest Rate, (b) except as
otherwise provided in Section 10.01(a), the Specified Reserve Fund Balance or
the manner in which the Reserve Fund is funded or (ii) reduce the aforesaid
percentage of the Outstanding Amount of the Notes, the Holders of which are
required to consent to any such amendment, without the consent of the Holders of
all Notes of the relevant Class then outstanding and the Certificate.

     (c)  Prior to the execution of any such amendment or consent, the Indenture
Trustee shall furnish written notification of the substance of such amendment or
consent, together with a copy thereof, to each Rating Agency.

     (d)  Promptly after the execution of any such amendment or consent, the
Owner Trustee and the Indenture Trustee, as the case may be, shall furnish
written notification of the substance of such amendment or consent to each
Noteholder. It shall not be necessary for the consent of Noteholders pursuant to
Section 11.01(b) to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment or
consent, but it shall be sufficient if such consent shall approve the

                                       61
<Page>

substance thereof. The manner of obtaining such consents and of evidencing the
authorization by Noteholders of the execution thereof shall be subject to such
reasonable requirements as the Owner Trustee or the Indenture Trustee may
prescribe.

     (e)  Prior to the execution of any amendment to this Agreement, the Owner
Trustee and the Indenture Trustee shall be entitled to receive and rely upon an
Opinion of Counsel stating that the execution of such amendment is authorized or
permitted by this Agreement. The Owner Trustee and the Indenture Trustee may,
but shall not be obligated to, enter into any such amendment which affects the
Owner Trustee's or the Indenture Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities
under this Agreement or otherwise.

     (f)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 11.01, the
Trust Depositor or the Servicer, acting on behalf of the Trust Depositor, may
request each Rating Agency to approve a formula for determining the Specified
Reserve Fund Balance that is different from the formula or result determined
from the current definition thereof contained herein so as to result in a
decrease in the amount of the Specified Reserve Fund Balance or the manner by
which such Reserve Fund is funded. If each Rating Agency delivers to the
Indenture Trustee and Owner Trustee a written notice or letter stating that such
action will not result in a reduction or withdrawal of the rating of any
outstanding Class with respect to which a Rating Agency has previously issued a
rating as a result or such action, then the Specified Reserve Fund Balance will
be theretofore determined in accordance with such changed formula or manner of
funding, and an amendment to this Agreement effecting such change may be
executed without the consent of any Securityholder.

     SECTION 11.02. PROTECTION OF TITLE TO TRUST.

     (a)  The Servicer shall file such financing statements and cause to be
filed such continuation statements, all in such manner and in such places as may
be required by law fully to preserve, maintain and protect the interest of the
Issuer, the Securityholders and the Indenture Trustee in the Contracts and in
the proceeds thereof. The Servicer shall deliver (or cause to be delivered) to
the Owner Trustee and the Indenture Trustee file-stamped copies of, or filing
receipts for, any document filed as provided above, as soon as available
following such filing. The Trust Depositor authorizes the Trust to file
financing statements describing the Trust Corpus as collateral.

     (b)  Neither the Seller, the Trust Depositor nor the Servicer shall change
its name, identity or corporate structure in any manner that would, could or
might make any financing statement or continuation statement filed in accordance
with Section 4.02 seriously misleading within the meaning of Section 9-507 of
the UCC, unless it shall have given the Issuer, the Owner Trustee and the
Indenture Trustee at least 30 days' prior written notice thereof and shall have
promptly filed appropriate amendments to all previously filed financing
statements or continuation statements.

change in its state of incorporation. The Servicer shall at all times maintain

systems so that, from and after the time of transfer under this Agreement of the
Contracts, the Servicer's master computer records (including any backup
archives) that shall refer to a Contract indicate clearly the interest of the
Issuer and the Indenture Trustee in such Contract and that such Contract is
owned by the Issuer and has been pledged to the Indenture Trustee. Indication of
the Issuer's ownership of and the Indenture Trustee's interest in a Contract
shall be deleted from or modified on the Servicer's computer systems when, and
only when, the related Contract shall have been paid in full or reacquired or
shall have become a Liquidated Contract.

     (f)  If at any time the Trust Depositor or the Servicer shall propose to
sell, grant a security interest in, or otherwise transfer any interest in
motorcycle conditional sales contracts or promissory note and security
agreements to any prospective purchaser, lender or other transferee, the
Servicer shall give or cause to be given to such prospective purchaser, lender
or other transferee computer tapes, records or print-outs (including any
restored from back-up archives) that, if they shall refer in any manner
whatsoever to any Contract, shall indicate clearly that such Contract has been
transferred and is owned by the Issuer and has been pledged to the Indenture
Trustee.

     (g)  The Servicer shall permit the Owner Trustee and its agents, at any
time during normal business hours, to inspect, audit and make copies of and
abstracts from the Servicer's records regarding any Contract.

     (h)  Upon request, the Servicer shall furnish to the Owner Trustee and the
Indenture Trustee, within five Business Days, a list of all Contracts then held
as part of the Trust Estate, together with a reconciliation of such list to the
List of Contracts and to each of the Monthly Reports furnished before such
request indicating removal of Contracts from the Trust.

     (i)  The Servicer shall deliver to the Owner Trustee, the Indenture Trustee
and each Rating Agency promptly after the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and of each amendment hereto, an Opinion of Counsel either (A) stating
that, in the opinion of such counsel, all financing statements and continuation
statements have been executed and filed that are necessary fully to preserve and
protect the interest of the Owner Trustee and the Indenture

<Page>

Trustee and reciting the details of each filings or referring to prior Opinions
of Counsel in which such details are given, or (B) stating that, in the opinion
of such counsel, no such action shall be necessary to preserve and protect such
interest.

     SECTION 11.03. GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement shall be construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Illinois and the obligations, rights,
and remedies of the parties under the Agreement shall be determined in
accordance with such laws, except that the duties of the Owner Trustee shall be
governed by the laws of the State of Delaware.

     SECTION 11.04. NOTICES. All notices, demands, certificates, requests and
communications hereunder ("notices") shall be in writing and shall be effective

Each party hereto may, by notice given in accordance herewith to each of the
other parties hereto, designate any further or different address to which
subsequent notices shall be sent.

     SECTION 11.05. SEVERABILITY OF PROVISIONS. If one or more of the covenants,
agreements, provisions or terms of this Agreement shall be for any reason
whatsoever held invalid, then such covenants, agreements, provisions or terms
shall be deemed severable from the remaining covenants, agreements, provisions
or terms of this Agreement and shall in no way affect the validity or
enforceability of the other provisions of this Agreement or of the Notes or the
Certificate or the rights of the Holders thereof.

     SECTION 11.06. ASSIGNMENT. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, as provided in Sections 6.03 and 8.03, this Agreement may not
be assigned by the Trust Depositor or the Servicer without the prior written
consent of Holders of Notes aggregating not less than 66-2/3% of each Class.

     SECTION 11.07. THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARIES. Except as otherwise specifically
provided herein, the parties hereto hereby manifest their intent that no third
party shall be deemed a third party beneficiary of this Agreement, and
specifically that the Obligors are not third party beneficiaries of this
Agreement.

     SECTION 11.08. COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in several
counterparts, each of which shall be an original and all of which shall together
constitute but one and the same instrument.

     SECTION 11.09. HEADINGS. The headings of the various Articles and Sections
herein are for convenience of reference only and shall not define or limit any
of the terms or provisions hereof.

     SECTION 11.10. NO BANKRUPTCY PETITION; DISCLAIMER AND SUBORDINATION. (a)
Each of the Seller, the Indenture Trustee, the Servicer, the Owner Trustee and
each Holder (by acceptance of the applicable Securities) covenants and agrees
that, prior to the date that is one year and one day after the payment in full
of all amounts owing in respect of all outstanding Securities, it will not
institute against the Trust Depositor, or the Trust, or join any other Person in
instituting against the Trust Depositor or the Trust, any bankruptcy,
reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation proceedings or other
similar proceedings under the laws

                                       66
<Page>

of the United States or any state of the United States. This Section 11.10 will
survive the termination of this Agreement.

     (b)  The Trust acknowledges and agrees that the Certificate represents a
beneficial interest in the Trust and Trust Corpus only and the Securities do not
represent an interest in any assets (other than the Trust Corpus) of the Trust
Depositor (including by virtue of any deficiency claim in respect of obligations
not paid or otherwise satisfied from the Trust Assets and proceeds thereof). In
furtherance of and not in derogation of the foregoing, to the extent that the
Trust Depositor enters into other securitization transactions, the Trust
acknowledges and agrees that it shall have no right, title or interest in or to
any assets (or interests therein) other than the Trust Assets conveyed or
purported to be conveyed (whether by way of a sale, capital contribution or by
the granting of a Lien) by the Trust Depositor to any Person other than the
Trust (the "OTHER ASSETS").

     To the extent that notwithstanding the agreements contained in this
Section, the Trust or any Securityholder, either (i) asserts an interest in or
claim to, or benefit from any Other Assets, whether asserted against or through
the Trust Depositor or any other Person owned by the Trust Depositor, or (ii) is
deemed to have any interest, claim or benefit in or from any Other Assets,
whether by operation of law, legal process, pursuant to applicable provisions of
Insolvency Laws or otherwise (including without limitation pursuant to Section
1111(b) of the federal Bankruptcy Code, as amended) and whether deemed asserted
against or through the Trust Depositor or any other Person owned by the Trust
Depositor, then the Trust and each Securityholder by accepting a Note or
Certificate further acknowledges and agrees that any such interest, claim or
benefit in or from the Other Assets is and shall be expressly subordinated to
the indefeasible payment in full of all obligations and liabilities of the Trust
Depositor which, under the terms of the documents relating to the securitization
of the Other Assets, are entitled to be paid from, entitled to the benefits of,
or otherwise secured by such Other Assets (whether or not any such entitlement
or security interest is legally perfected or otherwise entitled to a priority of
distribution under applicable law, including Insolvency Laws, and whether
asserted against the Trust Depositor or any other Person owned by the Trust
Depositor) including, without limitation, the payment of post-petition interest
on such other obligations and liabilities. This subordination agreement shall be
deemed a subordination agreement within the meaning of Section 510(a) of the
Bankruptcy Code. Each Securityholder is deemed to have acknowledged and agreed
that no adequate remedy at law exists for a breach of this Section 11.10 and
that the terms and provisions of this Section 11.10 may be enforced by an action
for specific performance.

     (c)  The provisions of this Section 11.10 shall be for the third party
benefit of those entitled to rely thereon and shall survive the termination of
this Agreement.

     SECTION 11.11. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY OF OWNER TRUSTEE AND INDENTURE
TRUSTEE.

     (a)  Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, this
Agreement has been executed by Wilmington Trust Company, not in its individual
capacity but solely in its capacity as Owner Trustee of the Issuer, and in no
event shall Wilmington Trust Company in its

                                       67
<Page>

individual capacity or any beneficial owner of the Issuer have any liability for
the representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or other obligations of
the Issuer hereunder, as to all of which recourse shall be had solely to the
assets of the Issuer. For all purposes of this Agreement, in the performance of
any duties or obligations of the Issuer hereunder, the Owner Trustee shall be
subject to, and entitled to the benefits of, the terms and provisions of
Articles Six, Seven and Eight of the Trust Agreement.

     (b)  Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, this
Agreement has been executed by BNY Midwest Trust Company, not in its individual
capacity but solely as Indenture Trustee, and in no event shall BNY Midwest
Trust Company have any liability for the representations, warranties, covenants,
agreements or other obligations of the Issuer hereunder or in any of the
certificates, notices or agreements delivered pursuant hereto, as to all of
which recourse shall be had solely to the assets of the Issuer.

                     HARLEY-DAVIDSON CUSTOMER FUNDING CORP.

                             PRESIDENT'S CERTIFICATE

     The undersigned certifies that she is President of Harley-Davidson Customer
Funding Corp., a Nevada corporation (the "TRUST DEPOSITOR"), and that as such is
duly authorized to execute and deliver this certificate on behalf of the Trust
Depositor in connection with the Sale and Servicing Agreement (the "AGREEMENT")
dated as of February 1, 2003 (the "EFFECTIVE DATE") by and among the Trust
Depositor, BNY Midwest Trust Company (the "INDENTURE TRUSTEE"), as Indenture
Trustee, Harley-Davidson Credit Corp. ("HARLEY-DAVIDSON CREDIT"), as Servicer,
and Harley-Davidson Motorcycle Trust 2003-1 ("ISSUER") (all capitalized terms
used herein without definition have the respective meanings set forth in the
Agreement), and further certifies as follows:

          (1)     Attached hereto as EXHIBIT I is a true and correct copy of the
     Articles of Incorporation of the Trust Depositor, together with all
     amendments thereto as in effect on the date hereof.

          (2)     There has been no other amendment or other document filed
     affecting the Articles of Incorporation of the Trust Depositor since
     May 12, 2000, and no such amendment has been authorized by the Board of
     Directors or shareholders of the Trust Depositor.

          (3)     Attached hereto as EXHIBIT II is a Certificate of the
     Secretary of State of the State of Nevada dated January 21, 2003 stating
     that the Trust Depositor is duly incorporated under the laws of the State
     of Nevada and is in good standing.

          (4)     Attached hereto as EXHIBIT III is a true and correct copy of
     the By-laws of the Trust Depositor, which are in full force and effect on
     the date hereof.

          (5)     Attached hereto as EXHIBIT IV is a true and correct copy of
     resolutions adopted pursuant to the unanimous written consent of the Board
     of Directors of the Trust Depositor relating to the execution, delivery and
     performance of the Agreement; the Transfer and Sale Agreement dated as of
     the Effective Date between the Trust Depositor and Harley-Davidson Credit;
     the Trust Agreement dated as of the Effective Date between the Trust
     Depositor and the Wilmington Trust Company (the "Owner Trustee"), as Owner
     Trustee; the Administrative Agreement dated as of the Effective Date
     between the Trust Depositor, the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee,
     Harley-Davidson Credit, as Administrator; the Underwriting Agreement dated
     January 28, 2003 among the Trust

                                       B-1
<Page>

     Depositor, Harley-Davidson Credit and the Underwriters (collectively, the
     "PROGRAM AGREEMENTS"). Said resolutions have not been amended, modified,
     annulled or revoked, and are on the date hereof in full force and effect
     and are the only resolutions relating to these matters which have been
     adopted by the Board of Directors.

          (6)     No event with respect to the Trust Depositor has occurred and
     is continuing which would constitute an Event of Termination or an event
     that, with notice or the passage of time or both, would become an Event of
     Termination under the Agreement. To the best of my knowledge after
     reasonable investigation, there has been no material adverse change in the
     condition, financial or otherwise, or the earnings, business affairs or
     business prospects of the Trust Depositor, whether or not arising in the
     ordinary course of business since the respective dates as of which
     information is given in the Prospectus and except as set forth therein.

          (7)     All federal, state and local taxes of the Trust Depositor due
     and owing as of the date hereof have been paid.

          (8)     All representations and warranties of the Trust Depositor
     contained in the Program Agreements or any other related documents, or in
     any document, certificate or financial or other statement delivered in
     connection therewith are true and correct as of the date hereof.

          (9)     There is no action, investigation or proceeding pending or, to
     our knowledge, threatened against the Trust Depositor before any court,
     administrative agency or other tribunal (a) asserting the invalidity of the
     Program Agreements; (b) seeking to prevent the consummation of any of the
     transactions contemplated by the Program Agreements; or (c) which is likely
     materially and adversely to affect the Trust Depositor's performance of its
     obligations under, or the validity or enforceability of, the Program
     Agreements.

          (10)    No consent, approval, authorization or order of, and no notice
     to or filing with, any governmental agency or body or state or federal
     court is required to be obtained by the Trust Depositor for the Trust
     Depositor's consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Program
     Agreements, except such as have been obtained or made and such as may be
     required under the blue sky laws of any jurisdiction in connection with the
     issuance and sale of the Certificate.

          (11)    The Trust Depositor is not a party to any agreements or
     instruments evidencing or governing indebtedness for money borrowed or by
     which the Trust Depositor or its property is bound (other than the Program
     Agreements). Neither Harley-Davidson Credit's transfer and assignment of
     the Contract Assets to the Trust Depositor, the Trust Depositor's
     concurrent transfer and assignment of the Trust Corpus to the Trust, nor
     the concurrent pledge of the Collateral by the Trust to the Indenture
     Trustee nor the issuance and sale of the Certificate and the Notes, nor the
     execution and delivery of the

                                       B-2
<Page>

     Program Agreements, nor the consummation of any other of the transactions
     contemplated therein, will violate or conflict with any agreement or
     instrument to which the Trust Depositor is a party or by which it is
     otherwise bound.

          (12)    In connection with the transfer of Contracts and related
     collateral contemplated in the Agreement, (a) the Trust Depositor has not
     made such transfer with actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud any
     creditor of the Trust Depositor, and (b) the Trust Depositor has not
     received less than a reasonably equivalent value in exchange for such
     transfer, is not on the date thereof insolvent (nor will become insolvent
     as a result thereof), is not engaged (or about to engage) in a business or
     transaction for which it has unreasonably small capital, and does not
     intend to incur or believe it will incur debts beyond its ability to pay
     when matured.

          (13)    Each of the agreements and conditions of the Trust Depositor
     to be performed on or before the Closing Date pursuant to the Program
     Agreements have been performed in all material respects.

                                     * * * *

                             PRESIDENT'S CERTIFICATE

     The undersigned certifies that she is President of Harley-Davidson Credit
Corp. ("HARLEY-DAVIDSON CREDIT"), and that as such is duly authorized to execute
and deliver this certificate on behalf of Harley-Davidson Credit, as Servicer,
in connection with the Sale and Servicing Agreement (the "SALE AND SERVICING
AGREEMENT") dated as of February 1, 2003 (the "EFFECTIVE DATE") by and among
Harley-Davidson Credit, as Servicer, Harley-Davidson Customer Funding Corp.
("CFC"), BNY Midwest Trust Company, as Indenture Trustee and Harley-Davidson
Motorcycle Trust 2003-1 ("ISSUER"), in connection with the Transfer and Sale
Agreement dated as of the Effective Date (the "TRANSFER AND SALE AGREEMENT") by
and between Harley-Davidson Credit and CFC (all capitalized terms used herein
without definition having the respective meanings set forth in the Sale and
Servicing Agreement), and further certifies as follows:

          (1)     Attached hereto as EXHIBIT I is a true and correct copy of the
     Articles of Incorporation of Harley-Davidson Credit, together with all
     amendments thereto as in effect on the date hereof.

          (2)     There has been no other amendment or other document filed
     affecting the Articles of Incorporation of Harley-Davidson Credit since
     August 9, 1999, and no such amendment has been authorized by the Board of
     Directors or shareholders of Harley-Davidson Credit.

          (3)     Attached hereto as EXHIBIT II is a Certificate of the
     Secretary of State of the State of Nevada dated January 21, 2003 stating
     that Harley-Davidson Credit is duly incorporated under the laws of the
     State of Nevada and is in good standing.

          (4)     Attached hereto as EXHIBIT III is a true and correct copy of
     the By-laws of Harley-Davidson Credit which were in full force and effect
     as of August 1999 and at all times subsequent thereto.

          (5)     Attached hereto as EXHIBIT IV is a true and correct copy of
     resolutions adopted pursuant to a unanimous written consent of the Board of
     Directors of Harley-Davidson Credit and relating to the authorization,
     execution, delivery and performance of the Transfer and Sale Agreement; the
     Sale and Servicing Agreement; the Underwriting Agreement dated January 28,
     2003 among Harley-Davidson Credit, CFC and the Underwriters (the
     "UNDERWRITING AGREEMENT"); and the Administration Agreement dated
     February 1, 2003 among Harley-Davidson Credit, CFC, the Issuer and

     Trust Company, as Indenture Trustee (the "INDENTURE TRUSTEE") (the
     "ADMINISTRATION AGREEMENT"). Said resolutions have not been amended,
     modified, annulled or revoked, and are on the date hereof in full force and
     effect and are the only resolutions relating to these matters which have
     been adopted by the Board of Directors.

          (6)     No event with respect to Harley-Davidson Credit has occurred
     and is continuing which would constitute an Event of Termination or an
     event that, with notice or the passage of time, would constitute an Event
     of Termination under the Sale and Servicing Agreement. To the best of my
     knowledge after reasonable investigation, there has been no material
     adverse change in the condition, financial or otherwise, or the earnings,
     business affairs or business prospects of Harley-Davidson Credit, whether
     or not arising in the ordinary course of business, since the respective
     dates as of which information is given in the Prospectus and except as set
     forth therein.

          (7)     All federal, state and local taxes of Harley-Davidson Credit
     due and owing as of the date hereof have been paid.

          (8)     All representations and warranties of Harley-Davidson Credit
     contained in the Transfer and Sale Agreement, the Sale and Servicing
     Agreement, the Underwriting Agreement and the Administration Agreement
     (collectively, the "PROGRAM AGREEMENTS") or in any document, certificate or
     financial or other statement delivered in connection therewith are true and
     correct as of the date hereof.

          (9)     There is no action, investigation or proceeding pending or, to
     my knowledge, threatened against Harley-Davidson Credit before any court,
     administrative agency or other tribunal (a) asserting the invalidity of any
     Program Agreement to which Harley-Davidson Credit is a party; or (b) which
     is likely materially and adversely to affect Harley-Davidson Credit's
     performance of its obligations under, or the validity or enforceability of,
     the Program Agreements.

          (10)    No consent, approval, authorization or order of, and no notice
     to or filing with, any governmental agency or body or state or federal
     court is required to be obtained by Harley-Davidson Credit for
     Harley-Davidson Credit's consummation of the transactions contemplated by
     the Program Agreements, except such as have been obtained or made and such
     as may be required under the blue sky laws of any jurisdiction in
     connection with the issuance and sale of the Notes or the Certificate.

          (11)    SCHEDULE A hereto contains a complete list of all material
     agreements (other than the Transfer and Sale Agreement) or instruments
     evidencing or governing indebtedness for money borrowed to which
     Harley-Davidson Credit is a party or by which Harley-Davidson Credit or its
     property is bound. Neither Harley-Davidson Credit's transfer and assignment
     of the Contract Assets to CFC, CFC's concurrent transfer and assignment of
     the Trust Corpus to the Trust, nor the concurrent pledge by the Trust of
     the Collateral to the Indenture Trustee, nor the issuance and sale of the
     Notes or

                                       C-2
<Page>

     the Certificate or the entering into of the Program Agreements, nor the
     consummation of any other of the transactions contemplated therein, will
     violate or conflict with any agreement or instrument to which
     Harley-Davidson Credit is a party or by which it is otherwise bound.

          (12)    In connection with the transfers of Contracts and related
     assets contemplated in the Transfer and Sale Agreement, (a) Harley-Davidson
     Credit has not made such transfer with actual intent to hinder, delay or
     defraud any creditor of Harley-Davidson Credit, and (b) Harley-Davidson
     Credit has not received less than a reasonably equivalent value in exchange
     for such transfer, is not on the date hereof insolvent (nor will
     Harley-Davidson Credit become insolvent as a result thereof), is not
     engaged (or about to engage) in a business or transaction for which it has
     unreasonably small capital, and does not intend to incur or believe it will
     incur debts beyond its ability to pay when matured.

          (13)    The sole shareholder of Harley-Davidson Credit is
     Harley-Davidson Financial Services, Inc., a Delaware corporation, which has
     its chief executive office and only office in Chicago, Illinois, and has no
     other offices in any other state.

          (14)    Each of the agreements and conditions of Harley-Davidson
     Credit to be performed or satisfied on or before the Closing Date under the
     Program Agreements has been performed or satisfied in all material
     respects.

          (15)    Each Contract being transferred pursuant to the Transfer and
     Sale Agreement is evidenced by a written agreement providing for a
     repayment obligation as well as a security interest in the related
     Motorcycle securing such obligation, and conforms as to these matters in
     all material respects with the form of written Contract provided as EXHIBIT
     A hereto (with such minor variations as to specific terms as may be
     required or deemed desirable in respect of the laws or requirements of
     particular states).

          (16)    Harley-Davidson Credit has not executed for filing any UCC
     financing statements listing the Contract Assets as collateral other than
     financing statements relating to the transactions contemplated in the
     Transfer and Sale Agreement and in the agreements listed on SCHEDULE A
     hereto.

                                    EXHIBIT J

                    [Seller's Representations and Warranties]

     (1)  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES REGARDING SELLER. Seller represents and
warrants, as of the execution and delivery of this Agreement and as of the
Closing Date, in the case of the Initial Contracts, and as of the applicable
Subsequent Transfer Date, in the case of Subsequent Contracts, that:

          (a)     ORGANIZATION AND GOOD STANDING. Seller is a corporation duly
     organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
     jurisdiction of its organization and has the corporate power to own its
     assets and to transact the business in which it is currently engaged.
     Seller is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is in
     good standing in each jurisdiction in which the character of the business
     transacted by it or properties owned or leased by it requires such
     qualification and in which the failure so to qualify would have a material
     adverse effect on the business, properties, assets, or condition (financial
     or otherwise) of Seller or Trust Depositor. Seller is properly licensed in
     each jurisdiction to the extent required by the laws of such jurisdiction
     to service the Contracts in accordance with the terms of the Sale and
     Servicing Agreement.

          (b)     AUTHORIZATION; BINDING OBLIGATION. Seller has the power and
     authority to make, execute, deliver and perform this Agreement and the
     other Transaction Documents to which the Seller is a party and all of the
     transactions contemplated under this Agreement and the other Transaction
     Documents to which the Seller is a party, and has taken all necessary
     corporate action to authorize the execution, delivery and performance of
     this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which the Seller is a
     party. This Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which the
     Seller is a party constitute the legal, valid and binding obligation of
     Seller enforceable in accordance with their terms, except as enforcement of
     such terms may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws
     affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and by the
     availability of equitable remedies.

          (c)     NO CONSENT REQUIRED. Seller is not required to obtain the
     consent of any other party or any consent, license, approval or
     authorization from, or registration or declaration with, any governmental
     authority, bureau or agency in connection with the execution, delivery,
     performance, validity or enforceability of this Agreement and the other
     Transaction Documents to which the Seller is a party.

          (d)     NO VIOLATIONS. Seller's execution, delivery and performance of
     this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which the Seller is a
     party will not violate any provision of any existing law or regulation or
     any order or decree of any court or the Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws
     of Seller, or constitute a material breach of any mortgage, indenture,
     contract or other agreement to which Seller is a party or by which Seller
     or any of Seller's properties may be bound.

                                       J-1
<Page>

          (e)     LITIGATION. No litigation or administrative proceeding of or
     before any court, tribunal or governmental body is currently pending, or to
     the knowledge of Seller threatened, against Seller or any of its properties
     or with respect to this Agreement or any other Transaction Document to
     which the Seller is a party which, if adversely determined, would in the
     opinion of Seller have a material adverse effect on the business,
     properties, assets or condition (financial or other) of Seller or the
     transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any other Transaction
     Document to which the Seller is a party.

          (f)     STATE OF INCORPORATION; NAME; NO CHANGES. Seller's state of
     incorporation is the State of Nevada. Seller's exact legal name is as set
     forth in the first paragraph of this Agreement. Seller has not changed its
     name whether by amendment of its Articles of Incorporation, by
     reorganization or otherwise, and has not changed its state of incorporation
     within the four months preceding the Closing Date.

          (g)     BUELL. Approximately 5.0% of the aggregate principal balance
     of contracts financed from time to time by the Seller are secured by
     motorcycles manufactured by Buell.

          (h)     SOLVENCY. The Seller, after giving effect to the conveyances
     made by it hereunder, is Solvent.

     (2)  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES REGARDING EACH CONTRACT. Seller
represents and warrants as to each Contract as of the execution and delivery of
this Agreement and as of the Closing Date, in the case of the Initial Contracts,
and as of the applicable Subsequent Transfer Date, in the case of Subsequent
Contracts, that:

          (a)     LIST OF CONTRACTS. The information set forth in the List of
     Contracts (or Subsequent List of Contracts, in the case of Subsequent
     Contracts) is true, complete and correct in all material respects as of the
     Initial Cutoff Date or applicable Subsequent Cutoff Date, as the case may
     be.

          (b)     PAYMENTS. As of the Initial Cutoff Date or applicable
     Subsequent Cutoff Date, as the case may be, the most recent scheduled
     payment with respect to any Contract either had been made or was not
     delinquent for more than 30 days. To the best of Seller's knowledge, all
     payments made on each Contract were made by the respective Obligor.

          (c)     NO WAIVERS. As of the Closing Date (or the applicable
     Subsequent Transfer Date, in the case of Subsequent Contracts), the terms
     of the Contracts have not been waived, altered or modified in any respect,
     except by instruments or documents included in the related Contract File.

          (d)     BINDING OBLIGATION. Each Contract is a legal, valid and
     binding payment obligation of the Obligor thereunder and is enforceable in
     accordance with its terms,

                                       J-2
<Page>

     except as such enforceability may be limited by insolvency, bankruptcy,
     moratorium, reorganization, or other similar laws affecting the enforcement
     of creditors' rights generally.

          (e)     NO DEFENSES. No Contract is subject to any right of
     rescission, setoff, counterclaim or defense, including the defense of
     usury, and the operation of any of the terms of such Contract or the
     exercise of any right thereunder will not render the Contract unenforceable
     in whole or in part or subject to any right of rescission, setoff,
     counterclaim or defense, including the defense of usury, and no such right
     of rescission, setoff, counterclaim or defense has been asserted with
     respect thereto.

          (f)     INSURANCE. As of the origination date of each Contract (or the
     applicable Subsequent Transfer Date in the case of Subsequent Contracts),
     the related Motorcycle securing each Contract is covered by physical damage
     insurance (i) in an amount not less than the value of the Motorcycle at the
     time of origination of the Contract, (ii) naming Seller as a loss payee and
     (iii) insuring against loss and damage due to fire, theft, transportation,
     collision and other risks covered by comprehensive coverage, and all
     premiums due on such insurance have been paid in full from the date of the
     Contract's origination.

          (g)     ORIGINATION. Either (i) Contracts were originated by a
     Harley-Davidson motorcycle dealer in the regular course of its business
     which dealer had all necessary licenses and permits to originate the
     Contracts in the state where such dealer was located, was fully and
     properly executed by the parties thereto, and has been purchased by Seller
     in the regular course of its business, or (ii) Contracts were originated by
     Eaglemark Savings Bank in the regular course of its business which had all
     necessary licenses and permits to originate the Contracts in the state
     where it was located, was fully and properly executed by the parties
     thereto, and has been purchased by Seller in the regular course of its
     business. Each Contract was sold by such motorcycle dealer or Eaglemark
     Savings Bank, as the case may be, to the Seller without any fraud or
     misrepresentation on the part of such motorcycle dealer or Eaglemark
     Savings Bank.

          (h)     LAWFUL ASSIGNMENT. No Contract was originated in or is subject
     to the laws of any jurisdiction whose laws would make the transfer and
     assignment of the Contract under this Agreement or under the Sale and
     Servicing Agreement or the pledge of the Contract under the Indenture
     unlawful, void or voidable.

          (i)     COMPLIANCE WITH LAW. None of the Contracts, the origination of
     the Contracts by the dealers or Eaglemark Savings Bank, the purchase of the
     Contracts by the Seller, the sale of the Contracts by the Seller to the
     Trust Depositor or the transfer of the Contracts by the Trust Depositor to
     the Trust, or any combination of the foregoing, violated as of the Closing
     Date or as of any Subsequent Transfer Date, as applicable, any requirement
     of any federal, state or local law and regulations thereunder, including,
     without limitation, usury, truth in lending, motor vehicle installment loan
     and equal credit

                                       J-3
<Page>

     opportunity laws, applicable to the Contracts and the sale of Motorcycles.
     Seller shall, for at least the period of this Agreement, maintain in its
     possession, available for the Trust Depositor's, and the Trustee's
     inspection, and shall deliver to Trust Depositor or the Trustee upon
     demand, evidence of compliance with all such requirements.

          (j)     CONTRACT IN FORCE. As of the Closing Date (or the applicable
     Subsequent Transfer Date in the case of Subsequent Contracts), no Contract
     has been satisfied or subordinated in whole or in part or rescinded, and
     the related Motorcycle securing any Contract has not been released from the
     lien of the Contract in whole or in part.

          (k)     VALID SECURITY INTEREST. Each Contract creates a valid,
     subsisting and enforceable first priority perfected security interest in
     favor of Seller or Eaglemark Savings Bank (as the case may be) in the
     Motorcycle covered thereby, and such security interest has been assigned by
     Eaglemark Savings Bank to Seller (where applicable) and by Seller to the
     Trust Depositor. The original certificate of title, certificate of lien or
     other notification or evidence (the "LIEN CERTIFICATE") issued by the body
     responsible for the registration of, and the issuance of certificates of
     title or evidence relating to, motor vehicles and liens thereon (the
     "REGISTRAR OF TITLES") of the applicable state shows the Seller or
     Eaglemark Savings Bank (as the case may be) as original secured party under
     each Contract as the holder of a first priority security interest in such
     Motorcycle. With respect to each Contract for which a written Lien
     Certificate is provided and has not yet been returned from the Registrar of
     Titles, the Seller has received written evidence that such Lien Certificate
     showing the Seller or Eaglemark Savings Bank as lienholder has been applied
     for. Eaglemark Savings Bank's security interest has been validly assigned
     by Eaglemark Savings Bank to Seller. The Seller's security interest has
     been validly assigned by the Seller to the Trust Depositor and by the Trust
     Depositor to the Issuer pursuant to this Agreement. Immediately after the
     transfer, each Contract will be secured by an enforceable and perfected
     first priority security interest in the Motorcycle in favor of the Trust as
     secured party, which security interest is prior to all other liens upon and
     security interests in such Motorcycle which now exist or may hereafter
     arise or be created (except, as to priority, for any lien for taxes, labor,
     materials or of any state law enforcement agency affecting a Motorcycle).

          (1)     CAPACITY OF PARTIES. All parties to any Contract had capacity
     to execute such Contract and all other documents related thereto and to
     grant the security interest purported to be granted thereby.

          (m)     GOOD TITLE. Each Contract was purchased by Seller for value
     and taken into possession prior to the Cutoff Date (or the applicable
     Subsequent Cutoff Date in the case of Subsequent Contracts) in the ordinary
     course of its business, without knowledge that the Contract was subject to
     a security interest. No Contract has been sold, assigned or pledged to any
     person other than Trust Depositor and the Trustee as the transferee of
     Trust Depositor, and prior to the transfer of the Contract to Trust
     Depositor, Seller had good and marketable title to each Contract free and
     clear of any encumbrance, equity,

                                       J-4
<Page>

     loan, pledge, charge, claim or security interest and was the sole owner
     thereof and had full right to transfer the Contract to Trust Depositor and
     to permit Trust Depositor to transfer the same to the Issuer, and, as of
     the Closing Date (or the applicable Subsequent Transfer Date in the case of
     Subsequent Contracts), the Issuer will have a first priority perfected
     security interest therein.

          (n)     NO DEFAULTS. As of the Initial Cutoff Date (or the applicable
     Subsequent Cutoff Date in the case of Subsequent Contracts), no default,
     breach, violation or event permitting acceleration existed with respect to
     any Contract and no event had occurred which, with notice and the
     expiration of any grace or cure period, would constitute such a default,
     breach, violation or event permitting acceleration under such Contract.
     Seller has not waived any such default, breach, violation or event
     permitting acceleration, and Seller has not granted any extension of
     payment terms on any Contract. As of the Initial Cutoff Date (or the
     applicable Subsequent Cutoff Date in the case of Subsequent Contracts), no
     Motorcycle had been repossessed.

          (o)     NO LIENS. As of the Closing Date (or the applicable Subsequent
     Transfer Date in the case of Subsequent Contracts) there are, to the best
     of Seller's knowledge, no liens or claims which have been filed for work,
     labor or materials affecting the Motorcycle securing any Contract which are
     or may be liens prior to, or equal with, the lien of such Contract.

          (p)     INSTALLMENTS. Each Contract has a fixed Contract Rate and
     provides for monthly payments of principal and interest which, if timely
     made, would fully amortize the loan on a simple-interest basis over its
     term.

          (q)     ENFORCEABILITY. Each Contract contains customary and
     enforceable provisions such as to render the rights and remedies of the
     holder thereof adequate for the realization against the collateral of the
     benefits of the security.

          (r)     ONE ORIGINAL. Each Contract is evidenced by only one original
     executed Contract, which original is being held by the Servicer as
     custodian.

          (s)     NO GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS. No Obligor is the United States
     government or an agency, authority, instrumentality or other political
     subdivision of the United States government.

          (t)     LOCKBOX BANK. The Lockbox Bank is the only institution holding
     any Lockbox Account for receipt of payments from Obligors, and all
     Obligors, and only such Obligors, have been instructed to make payments to
     the Lockbox Account, and no person claiming through or under Seller has any
     claim or interest in the Lockbox Account other than the Lockbox Bank;
     provided, however, that other "Trusts" (as defined in the Lockbox
     Agreement) shall have an interest in certain other collections therein not
     related to the Contracts.

                                       J-5
<Page>

          (u)     OBLIGOR BANKRUPTCY. At the Cutoff Date (or the applicable
     Subsequent Cutoff Date in the case of Subsequent Contracts), no Obligor was
     subject to a bankruptcy proceeding within the one year preceding such
     Cutoff Date.

          (v)     CHATTEL PAPER. The Contracts constitute tangible chattel paper
     within the meaning of the UCC.

          (w)     NO IMPAIRMENT. Neither the Seller nor the Trust Depositor has
     done anything to convey any right to any Person that would result in such
     Person having a right to payments due under the Contract or otherwise to
     impair the rights of the Trust in any Contract or the proceeds thereof.

          (x)     CONTRACT NOT ASSUMABLE. No Contract is assumable by another
     Person in a manner which would release the Obligor thereof from such
     Obligor's obligations to the Trust Depositor with respect to such Contract.

     (3)  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES REGARDING THE CONTRACTS IN THE
AGGREGATE. Seller represents and warrants, as of the execution and delivery of
this Agreement and as of the Closing Date, in the case of the Initial Contracts,
and as of the applicable Subsequent Transfer Date, in the case of Subsequent
Contracts, that:

          (a)     AMOUNTS. The sum of the aggregate Principal Balances payable
     by Obligors under the Contracts as of the Initial Cutoff Date (or the
     applicable Subsequent Cutoff Date in the case of Subsequent Contracts),
     plus the Pre-Funded Amount as of such date, equals the sum of the principal
     balance of the Class A-1 Notes, the Class A-2 Notes and the Class B Notes
     on the Closing Date or the related Subsequent Transfer Date, as applicable.

          (b)     CHARACTERISTICS. The Initial Contracts have the following
     characteristics: (i) all the Contracts are secured by Motorcycles; (ii) no
     Initial Contract has a remaining maturity of more than 84 months; and (iii)
     the final scheduled payment on the Initial Contract with the latest
     maturity is due not later than February 2010. Approximately 76.82% of the
     Principal Balance of the Initial Contracts as of the Initial Cutoff Date is
     attributable to loans for purchases of new Motorcycles and approximately
     23.18% is attributable to loans for purchases of used Motorcycles. No
     Initial Contract was originated after the Initial Cutoff Date. No Initial
     Contract has a Contract Rate less than 4.99%. The first scheduled payment
     date of the Contracts (including any Subsequent Contracts) is due no later
     than August 2003. Approximately 0.02% of the Principal Balance of the
     Initial Contracts as of the Initial Cutoff Date is attributable to loans
     for purchases of Motorcycles not manufactured by Harley-Davidson or Buell.

          (c)     MARKING RECORDS. As of the Closing Date (or the applicable
     Subsequent Transfer Date in the case of Subsequent Contracts), Seller has
     caused the Computer Disk relating to the Contracts sold hereunder and
     concurrently reconveyed by Trust Depositor to the Trust and pledged by the
     Trust to the Indenture Trustee to be clearly and

                                       J-6
<Page>

     unambiguously marked to indicate that such Contracts constitute part of the
     Trust Corpus, are owned by the Trust and constitute security for the Notes.

          (d)     NO ADVERSE SELECTION. No selection procedures adverse to
     Noteholders have been employed in selecting the Contracts.

          (e)     TRUE SALE. The transaction contemplated by this Agreement
     constitutes a valid sale, transfer and assignment from Seller to Trust
     Depositor and from Trust Depositor to the Trust of all of Seller's right,
     title and interest in the Contract Assets as of the Closing Date and any
     Subsequent Transfer Date, as applicable.

          (f)     ALL FILINGS MADE. All filings (including, without limitation,
     UCC filings) required to be made by any Person and actions required to be
     taken or performed by any Person in any jurisdiction to give the Trustee a
     first priority perfected lien on, or ownership interest in, the Contracts
     and the proceeds thereof and the rest of the Trust Corpus have been made,
     taken or performed.

          (g)     DELTA LOANS. No more than 11.00% of the Principal Balance of
     the Contracts as of the end of the Funding Period is attributable to Delta
     Loans.

     (4)  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES REGARDING THE CONTRACT FILES. Seller
represents and warrants as of the execution and delivery of this Agreement and
as of the Closing Date, in the case of the Initial Contracts, and as of the
applicable Subsequent Transfer Date, in the case of Subsequent Contracts, that:

          (a)     POSSESSION. Immediately prior to the Closing Date or any
     Subsequent Transfer Date, the Servicer will have possession of each
     original Contract and the related complete Contract File, and there are and
     there will be no custodial agreements relating to the same in effect. Each
     of such documents which is required to be signed by the Obligor has been
     signed by the Obligor in the appropriate spaces. All blanks on any form
     have been properly filled in and each form has otherwise been correctly
     prepared. The complete Contract File for each Contract currently is in the
     possession of the Servicer.

          (b)     BULK TRANSFER LAWS. The transfer, assignment and conveyance of
     the Contracts and the Contract Files by Seller pursuant to the Transfer and
     Sale Agreement or any Subsequent Purchase Agreement and by Trust Depositor
     pursuant to the Sale and Servicing Agreement is not subject to the bulk
     transfer or any similar statutory provisions in effect in any applicable
     jurisdiction.
