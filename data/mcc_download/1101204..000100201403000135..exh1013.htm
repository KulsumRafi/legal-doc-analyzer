<P>Attention: Mr. Blake Stafford</P>

<P>Dear Blake,</P>

<P>Re: Blue Mountain Project, Humboldt Co., Nevada</P>

<P>Further to our recent discussions regarding the Blue Mountain Project, located in Section 14, T36N, R34E, and your subsequent discussion with David De Witt, we would like to set out the terms and conditions which would form the basis of an agreement between wwbroadcast.net ("Optionee") and Nassau Ltd. ("Optionor").</P>

<P>It is our intention that if we are able to agree on terms as detailed in this Letter Agreement, then a mere formal agreement ("Formal Agreement") will be prepared incorporating the terms of this Letter Agreement as well as such other terms as we may agree to, including standard terms which normally are part of a more indepth mining/option agreement.</P>

<P>The terms which we have been discussing in regards to the Blue Mountain Project are as follows:</P>

<P>The Optionor will grant the Optionee the right to acquire a 100% undivided interest in the Blue Mountain Project ("Option"), subject to a retained net smelter royalty ("NSR") on gold of 2% reserved to the Optionor ("Royalty") on the following terms and conditions:</P>

<P>1.  The Option is exercisable over a six (6) year period and, in order to maintain the Option in good standing, the Optionee will issue shares and make cash payments to the Optionor, as follows:</P>
<dir>
<P>(a)  the issuance of 50,000 common shares in the Optionee upon the TXS Verture Exchange ("TSX") approving ("Approval Date") the Blue Mouatain Project as a "qualifying property" (as defined with the rules and policies of the TSX);</P>

<P>(b)  the issuance of an additional 50,000 common shares in the Optinee on or before one year following the Approval Date;</P>

<P>(c)  two years following the Approval Data a payment in the amount of $20,000;</P>

<P>(d)  three years following the Approval Date a payment in the amount of $30,000;</P>
