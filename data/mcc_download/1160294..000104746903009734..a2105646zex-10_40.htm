SIZE=2><B>NOW, THEREFORE</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements contained herein, Smith's and Anchor hereby agree as follows: </FONT></P>

and Anchor hereby hires from Smith's approximately two hundred (200)&nbsp;square feet of space in the front portion of each of those certain supermarkets commonly known as Smith's Food&nbsp;&amp; Drug
Centers located in the greater metropolitan area of Clark County and Washoe County, Nevada, more specifically described in the exhibit attached hereto and made a part hereof and marked Exhibit "A" for
the purposes of the operation of gaming devises. In the future, Smith's may open additional supermarkets in other Nevada counties. (All of the supermarkets listed in Exhibit "A" and any supermarkets
opened in the future (see Paragraph&nbsp;14) are herein collectively called "Supermarkets" and the premises so subleased or leased to Anchor are collectively called the "Demised Premises.") The
effective lease term as to each Supermarket and the Demised Premises located therein shall, subject to completion of construction of new stores, commence on the Commencement Date shown on Exhibit "A,"
unless Smith's is able to deliver the Demised Premises to Anchor on an earlier date, in which case the Lease Term Commencement Date shall be such earlier date. In the event that Smith's moves the
location of the entrance to any of the Supermarkets or, the checkstands, or in the event Smith's shall undertake maintenance, repair, or remodeling of any store listed in Exhibit "A," which would in
any manner affect, impair, or impede access to or ingress or egress from the Demised Premises, Smith's agrees to allow Anchor to relocate temporarily its 200 square feet of Demised Premises to a
mutually agreeable location in the affected store until such time as repair, maintenance, or remodeling is complete. With respect thereto, Smith's hereby represents and warrants to Anchor, and this
Agreement and the payment of rent and other sums required by Paragraph&nbsp;4(a) hereof by Anchor to Smith's, as hereinafter provided, is expressly made upon, the condition that Smith's is presently

or will be on the commencement of the term hereof, in full force and effect without default thereunder. The Demised Premises shall be used by Anchor for the installation and operation </FONT></P>

agrees to pay Smiths, as a monthly rental for the use and occupancy of each of the Supermarkets and the exclusive right to operate Gaming Devices in each of the
Supermarkets listed on Exhibit "A" for each of the Lease Months ("Lease Months") the rental specified in Paragraph&nbsp;4 hereof. In addition, Anchor shall pay to Smith's the sum of RCT per month
during the term hereof as an advertising allowance (in lieu of the rentals previously paid for Store #362 which was closed.) The rental for each Supermarket and advertising allowance is payable
monthly, in advance, on the first day of each month (or Commencement Date if other than the first day of any given month). The monthly
rental may be prorated or reduced as provided in Subparagraph (b)&nbsp;herein or Paragraph&nbsp;13 hereof. All rental payments shall be made to Smith's at 1550 South Redwood Road, Salt Lake City,
Utah 84104. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;In
the event that the Commencement Date for Gaming Device operations at any Supermarket subject to this Agreement falls on a day other than the first day of the month,
then the monthly payment due to Smith's for such location shall be prorated to reflect the actual portion of the month during which Gaming Device operations are conducted at such locations by Anchor.
Smith's and Anchor further agree that in the event the term of any Master Lease under which Smith's occupies any of the Supermarkets terminates in accordance with its terms, or Smith's vacates or
ceases to operate any of the Supermarkets, then, in any such events, this Agreement, as it applies to that Supermarket, shall terminate and the rental shall be prorated to such termination. </FONT></P>

Paragraph&nbsp;3, shall be paid in advance on or before the first day of each month (or in situations where the Commencement Date specified on Exhibit "A" is other than the first day of the month,
the prorated rental owing for the remainder of the then current month shall be paid on said Commencement Date) as follows: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based
upon fifteen (15)&nbsp;gaming machines per Supermarket being allowed by Nevada law, the monthly rent shall be a minimum of RCT (plus amount of interest paid, if applicable) per
Supermarket. Each Gaming Machine over fifteen (15)&nbsp;in any one Supermarket shall increase the minimum annual rental by RCT per month. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;Anchor,

the prompt payment by Anchor to Smith's of all rents due to Smith's and to be applied to any damages caused to the Demised Premises by Anchor's operations in conjunction with Anchor's operation of
Gaming Devices at the Supermarkets subject to this Agreement. Anchor and Smith's agree that the Security Deposits are interest free, but should Nevada Gaming Authorities require interest be paid,
interest will accrue and be payable at the rate of eight percent (8%) per annum and the monthly rental shall increase to totally offset such interest charge. The Security Deposit or any portion
thereof may, at the option of Anchor, be applied against rental and advertising allowance owing during the last monthly periods of this Agreement (as necessary). </FONT></P>
