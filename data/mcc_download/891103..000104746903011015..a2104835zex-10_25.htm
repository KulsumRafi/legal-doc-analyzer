Company's policies as in effect from time to time; </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>provided</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> that nothing herein shall preclude Executive from (x)&nbsp;continuing to serve on any

boards of directors or trustees or advisory committees of any business entity or any charitable organization, subject to the approval of the Company (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld) or
(y)&nbsp;managing personal investments, provided in each case, and in the aggregate, that such activities do not materially interfere with the performance of Executive's duties hereunder or violate
the provisions of Section&nbsp;2(c) of the Standard Terms and Conditions (as defined in Section&nbsp;2A below). Executive's principal place of employment shall be the Company's principal corporate
offices located in New York, New York. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>2A.</FONT><FONT

<P><FONT SIZE=2>(c)</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RESTRICTED STOCK.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In consideration of Executive's entering into this agreement and as an inducement for Executive to join
the Company, Executive shall be granted 75,000 restricted shares of common stock of the Company (the "Restricted Stock"), pursuant to the 2000 Stock and Annual Incentive Plan and a restricted stock
agreement issued there under, subject to the approval of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Compensation Committee"). The date of grant of the Restricted Stock
shall be the later of (x)&nbsp;the Effective Date and (y)&nbsp;the date such grant is approved by the Compensation Committee. 25,000 shares of the Restricted Stock shall vest and no longer be
subject to restriction or risk of forfeiture sixty (60)&nbsp;days after the Effective Date, unless prior to such date, Executive's employment with the Company is terminated by the Company for Cause
(as defined in Section&nbsp;1(c) of the Standard Terms and Conditions) or due to Executive's resignation without Good Reason (as defined in Section&nbsp;1(d) of the Standard Terms and Conditions).
The remaining 50,000 shares of the Restricted Stock (the "Performance Stock") (x)&nbsp;will be subject to such performance conditions as the Compensation Committee determines are appropriate
and advisable to meet the conditions of Section&nbsp;162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, as currently in effect, as such fixed performance conditions (e.g., no further Compensation Committee
discretion) shall be reflected in the minutes of the meeting of the properly constituted Compensation Committee under Section&nbsp;162(m) considering such performance conditions (the "Performance
Conditions"), and will be no less favorable to Executive than the performance conditions made applicable by the Compensation Committee to any restricted stock awards granted to other similarly
situated executive officers of the Company proximate to the Effective Date (e.g., in December&nbsp;2002 and/or January or February of 2003) and (y)&nbsp;shall vest and no longer be subject to
restriction or risk of forfeiture on the third anniversary of the Effective Date (the "Performance Stock Vesting Date"), subject to satisfaction of the Performance Conditions and Executive's continued
employment with the Company through the Performance Stock Vesting Date; provided, however, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the Executive's employment is (i)&nbsp;terminated by the
Company without Cause (as defined in Section&nbsp;1(c) of the Standard Terms and Conditions) or (ii)&nbsp;due to Executive's resignation for Good Reason (as defined in Section&nbsp;1(d) of the
Standard Terms and Conditions) on any day of the calendar year other than the last day of the Company's taxable year in any given year, all of the above-referenced Performance Stock shall immediately
vest and cease to be subject to further restriction or forfeiture as of the date of such termination of Executive's employment. In addition, notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of Executive's
termination of employment with the Company prior to the Performance Stock Vesting Date due to Executive's death or Disability (as defined in Section&nbsp;1(b) of the Standard Terms and Conditions),
a pro-rata portion of the Performance Stock shall immediately vest and cease to be subject to further restriction or forfeiture as of the date of such termination of Executive's
employment, based upon the percentage of the period from the Effective Date through the Performance Stock Vesting Date that shall have elapsed through and including the date of such termination of
employment. In the event of any change in corporate capitalization which occurs prior to the date of grant of the Restricted Stock which results in an adjustment under Section&nbsp;3 of the
Company's 2000 Stock and Annual Incentive Plan, the number of shares of Restricted Stock shall be adjusted to reflect the adjustments made to outstanding awards under the 2000 Stock and Annual
Incentive Plan. </FONT></P>

SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BENEFITS.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the Effective Date through the date of termination of Executive's employment with the Company for any
reason, Executive shall be entitled to participate in any welfare, health and life insurance and pension benefit and incentive programs as may be adopted from time to time by the Company on the same
basis as that provided to similarly situated employees of the Company. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Executive shall be entitled to the following benefits: </FONT></P>

course of employment by the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates, including (without limitation) any proprietary knowledge, trade secrets, data, formulae, information and client and
customer lists and all papers, resumes, and records (including computer records) of the documents containing such Confidential Information. Executive acknowledges that such Confidential Information is
specialized, unique in nature and of great value to the Company and its subsidiaries or affiliates, and that such information gives the Company and its subsidiaries or affiliates a competitive
advantage. Executive agrees to deliver or return to the Company, at the Company's request at any time or upon termination or expiration of Executive's employment or as soon thereafter as possible, all
documents, computer tapes and disks, records, lists, data, drawings, prints, notes and written information (and all copies thereof) furnished by the Company and its subsidiaries or affiliates or

general operations and the industries in which they engage in business. In addition, during the Consulting Period, Executive will aid, assist and consult with the Company and its subsidiaries and
affiliates with respect to their dealings with clients and the enhancement of their recognition and reputation. During the Consulting Period, Executive shall devote such time and energies to the
affairs of the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates as may be reasonably required to carry out her duties hereunder without jeopardizing Executive's then full-time,
non-Company Business employment opportunities; provided, however, that Executive shall not be obligated to devote more than 50&nbsp;hours per year to the performance of such duties. In
consideration of Executive's consulting services, and in consideration of Executive's covenants contained in this Section&nbsp;2, the Company shall pay to Executive $10,000 during each full year of
the Consulting Period, payable in equal monthly installments. The Company further agrees to reimburse Executive for all reasonable and necessary business expenses incurred by Executive in the
performance of her consulting services in accordance with the Company's reimbursement policy, including, without limitation, the submission of supporting evidence as reasonably required by the
Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Executive shall cease
to be obligated to provide any such consulting services during any period when the provision of such services would be prohibited by any subsequent employer. </FONT></P>
