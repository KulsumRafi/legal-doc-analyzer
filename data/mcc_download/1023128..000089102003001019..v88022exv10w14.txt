                                 PROMISSORY NOTE

$27,500,000                                 Dated as of: _______________________

LITHIA FINANCIAL CORPORATION                                             ("LFC")

LITHIA AIRCRAFT, INC.                                                    ("LAI")

U.S. BANK NATIONAL ASSOCIATION                                        ("Lender")

1. TYPE OF CREDIT. This note is given to evidence LFC'S and LAI's obligation to
repay all sums which Lender may from time to time advance to LFC and LAI
("Advances") under a revolving line of credit. No Advances shall be made which
create a maximum amount outstanding at any one time which exceeds the maximum
amount shown in Section 2. However, Advances hereunder may be borrowed, repaid
and reborrowed, and the aggregate Advances loaned hereunder from time to time
may exceed such maximum amount.

2. PRINCIPAL BALANCE. The unpaid principal balance of all Advances outstanding
under this note ("Principal Balance") at one time shall not exceed $27,500,000
minus the aggregate outstanding principal balance of the Term-Out Notes (as
defined in the Loan Agreement between LFC, LAI, Lender and certain other
parties, dated as of September 20, 1999, as amended from time to time).

3. PROMISE TO PAY. For value received, LFC and LAI (individually and
collectively, "Borrower") jointly and severally promise to pay to Lender or
order at U.S. Bank National Association, Commercial Loan Service Center West,
555 Southwest Oak Street, PL-7, Portland, Oregon 97204, or such other address as
Lender may designate, the Principal Balance of this note, with interest thereon
at the rate(s) specified below.

4. INTEREST RATE. Interest on each Advance hereunder shall accrue at an annual
rate equal to 1.75% plus the one-month LIBOR rate (the "LIBOR Borrowing Rate")
quoted by Lender from Telerate Page 3750 or any successor thereto, which shall
be that one-month LIBOR rate in effect and reset each New York banking day.
Lender's internal records of applicable interest rates shall be determinative in
the absence of manifest error. For determining payment dates for LIBOR rate
loans, the New York banking day shall be the standard convention. In the event
after the date of initial funding any governmental authority subjects Lender to
any new or additional charge, fee, withholding or tax of any kind with respect
to any loans hereunder or changes the method of taxation of such loans or
changes the reserve or deposit requirements applicable to such loans, Borrower
shall pay to Lender such additional amounts as will compensate Lender for such
costs or lost income resulting therefrom as reasonably determined by Lender.


PROMISSORY NOTE - 1
<PAGE>

5. COMPUTATION OF INTEREST. All interest on this note will be computed at the
applicable rate based on a 360-day year and applied to the actual number of days
elapsed.

6. PAYMENT SCHEDULE.

      a. PRINCIPAL. Principal shall be paid on January 31, 2004 ("Maturity
Date").

      b. INTEREST. Interest shall be paid on the 1st day of each month beginning
with the month after the date this note is dated, and on the Maturity Date.

7. PREPAYMENT. Prepayments may be made at any time without penalty. Principal
prepayments will not postpone the date of or change the amount of any regularly
scheduled payment. At the time of any principal prepayment, all accrued
interest, fees, costs and expenses shall also be paid.

8. ALTERNATE PAYMENT DATE. Notwithstanding any other term of this note, if in
any month there is no day on which a scheduled payment would otherwise be due
(e.g. February 31), such payment shall be paid on the last banking day of that
month.

9. PAYMENT BY AUTOMATIC DEBIT. Borrower hereby authorizes Lender to
automatically deduct the amount of all principal and interest payments from
account number 153600740853 with Lender. If there are insufficient funds in the
account to pay the automatic deduction in full, Lender may allow the account to
become overdrawn, or Lender may reverse the automatic deduction. Borrower will
pay all the fees on the account which result from the automatic deductions,
including any overdraft and non-sufficient funds charges. If for any reason
Lender does not charge the account for a payment, or if an automatic payment is
reversed, the payment is still due according to this note. If the account is a
Money Market Account, the number of withdrawals from that account is limited as
set out in the account agreement. Lender may cancel the automatic deduction at
any time in its discretion. Provided, however, if no account number is entered
above, Borrower does not want to make payments by automatic debit.

10. DEFAULT.

      a. Any Event of Default under the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement
between Borrower, Lender, Lithia Salmir, Inc., and Lithia Motors, Inc. dated
_______________________, and any amendments, modifications, supplements,
renewals, substitutions and replacements thereof or therefor ("Loan Agreement"),
shall be an event of default hereunder.

      b. Without prejudice to any right of Lender to require payment on demand,
upon the occurrence of an event of default, Lender may terminate all commitments
to lend, cease making Advances, Setoff and declare the entire unpaid Principal
Balance on this note and all accrued unpaid interest immediately due and
payable, without notice; provided, however, that if any proceeding under any
bankruptcy or insolvency laws is commenced by or against Borrower, all
commitments to lend shall be immediately terminated without notice and the
entire Principal Balance and all accrued, unpaid interest shall, without notice,
become immediately due and payable. Upon default, including failure to pay upon
final maturity, Lender, at its option, may also, if permitted under applicable
law, increase the interest rate on this note by 2% per annum ("Default Rate").
The interest rate will not


PROMISSORY NOTE - 2
<PAGE>

exceed the maximum rate permitted by applicable law. In addition, if any payment
of principal or interest is 19 or more days past due, Borrower will be charged a
late charge of 5% of the delinquent payment.

11. EVIDENCE OF PRINCIPAL BALANCE; PAYMENT ON DEMAND. Holder's records shall, at
any time, be conclusive evidence of the unpaid Principal Balance and interest
owing on this note. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this note, in the
event holder makes Advances hereunder which result in an unpaid Principal
Balance on this note which at any time exceeds the maximum amount specified in
Section 2, Borrower agrees that all such Advances, with interest, shall be
payable on demand.

12. CREDIT BALANCES; SETOFF. As additional security for the payment of the
obligations described in this note or any document securing or related to the
loan evidenced by this note (collectively, the "Loan Documents"), and any other
obligations of Borrower to Lender of any nature whatsoever (collectively, the
"Obligations"), Borrower hereby grants to Lender a security interest in, a lien
on, and an express contractual right to set off against all depository account
balances, cash, and any other property of Borrower now or hereafter in the
possession of Lender and the right to refuse to allow withdrawals from any
account (collectively, "Setoff"). Lender may, at any time upon the occurrence of
an Event of Default (notwithstanding any notice requirements or grace/cure
periods under this or other agreements between Borrower and Lender) Setoff
against the Obligations whether or not the Obligations (including future
installments) are then due or have been accelerated, all without any advance or
contemporaneous notice of demand of any kind to Borrower, such notice and demand
being expressly waived.

13. REQUESTS FOR ADVANCES.

      a. Any Advance may be made upon the request of any person or persons
authorized to execute and deliver promissory notes to Lender on behalf of
Borrower or any other person authorized in writing by Borrower to request
Advances.

      b. All Advances shall be disbursed by deposit directly to Borrower's
account number 153600740853 with Lender, or by cashier's check issued to
Borrower.

      c. Borrower agrees that Lender shall have no obligation to verify the
identity of any person making any request pursuant to this note, and Borrower
assumes all risks of the validity and authorization of such requests. In
consideration of Lender agreeing, at its sole discretion, to make Advances upon
such requests, Borrower promises to pay holder, in accordance with the
provisions of this note, the Principal Balance together with interest thereon
and other sums due hereunder, although any Advances may have been requested by a
person or persons not authorized to do so.

14. PERIODIC REVIEW. Lender will review Borrower's credit accommodations
periodically. At the time of the review, Borrower will furnish Lender with any
additional information regarding Borrower's financial condition and business
operations that Lender requests. This information may include but is not limited
to, financial statements, tax returns, lists of assets and liabilities, agings
of receivables and payables, inventory schedules, budgets and forecasts. If upon
review, Lender, in its


PROMISSORY NOTE - 3
<PAGE>

sole discretion, determines that there has been a material adverse change in
Borrower's financial condition, Borrower will be in default. Upon default,
Lender shall have all rights specified herein.

15. NOTICES. Any notice hereunder may be given by ordinary mail, postage paid
and addressed to Borrower at the last known address of Borrower as shown on
holder's records. If Borrower consists of more than one person, notification of
any of said persons shall be complete notification of all.

16. ATTORNEY FEES. Whether or not litigation or arbitration is commenced,
Borrower promises to pay all costs of collecting overdue amounts. Without
limiting the foregoing, in the event that holder consults an attorney regarding
the enforcement of any of its rights under this note or any document securing
the same, or if this note is placed in the hands of an attorney for collection
or if suit or litigation is brought to enforce this note or any document
securing the same, Borrower promises to pay all costs thereof including such
additional sums as the court may adjudge reasonable as attorney fees, including
without limitation, costs and attorney fees incurred at trial, in any appellate
court, in any proceeding under the bankruptcy code, or in any receivership and
post-judgment attorney fees incurred in enforcing any judgment.

17. WAIVERS; CONSENT. Each party hereto, whether maker, co-maker, guarantor or
otherwise, waives diligence, demand, presentment for payment, notice of
non-payment, protest and notice of protest and waives all defenses based on
suretyship or impairment of collateral. Without notice to Borrower and without
diminishing or affecting Lender's rights or Borrower's obligations hereunder,
Lender may deal in any manner with any person who at any time is liable for, or
provides any real or personal property collateral for, any indebtedness of
Borrower to Lender, including the indebtedness evidenced by this note. Without
limiting the foregoing, Lender may, in its sole discretion: (a) make secured or
unsecured loans to Borrower and agree to any number of waivers, modifications,
extensions and renewals of any length of such loans, including the loan
evidenced by this note; (b) impair, release (with or without substitution of new
collateral), fail to perfect a security interest in, fail to preserve the value
of, fail to dispose of in accordance with applicable law, any collateral
provided by any person; (c) sue, fail to sue, agree not to sue, release, and
settle or compromise with, any person.

18. JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY. All undertakings of the undersigned Borrowers
are joint and several and are binding upon any marital community of which any of
the undersigned are members. Holder's rights and remedies under this note shall
be cumulative.

19. GOVERNING LAW. This note shall be governed by and construed and enforced in
accordance with the laws of the State of Oregon without regard to conflicts of
law principles; provided, however, that to the extent that Lender has greater
rights or remedies under Federal law, this provision shall not be deemed to
deprive Lender of such rights and remedies as may be available under Federal
law.

20. RENEWAL NOTE. This note renews, increases the amount of and modifies the
terms of the promissory note executed by Borrower dated November 9, 2000, in the
principal amount of $27,500,000, but shall not be deemed to be a replacement for
or to constitute a novation of such note.

<PAGE>

                                    EXHIBIT B
                                 PREPAYMENT FEE

PREPAYMENT: THERE SHALL BE NO PREPAYMENTS OF THIS NOTE, PROVIDED THAT THE BANK
MAY CONSIDER REQUESTS FOR ITS CONSENT WITH RESPECT TO PREPAYMENT OF THIS NOTE,
WITHOUT INCURRING AN OBLIGATION TO DO SO, AND THE BORROWER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IN
THE EVENT THAT SUCH CONSENT IS GRANTED, THE BORROWER SHALL BE REQUIRED TO PAY
THE BANK, UPON PREPAYMENT OF ALL OR PART OF THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT BEFORE FINAL
MATURITY, A PREPAYMENT FEE EQUAL TO THE MAXIMUM OF: (a) ZERO, OR (b) THAT
AMOUNT, CALCULATED ON ANY PREPAYMENT DATE, WHICH IS DERIVED BY SUBTRACTING: (a)
THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE NOTE OR PORTION OF THE NOTE TO BE PREPAID FROM (b)
THE NET PRESENT VALUE OF THE NOTE OR PORTION OF THE NOTE TO BE PREPAID ON SUCH
DATE OF PREPAYMENT; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT THE PREPAYMENT FEE SHALL NOT IN ANY
EVENT EXCEED THE MAXIMUM PREPAYMENT FEE PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.

      "NET PRESENT VALUE" SHALL MEAN THE AMOUNT WHICH IS DERIVED BY SUMMING THE
      PRESENT VALUES OF EACH PROSPECTIVE PAYMENT OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST
      WHICH, WITHOUT SUCH FULL OR PARTIAL PREPAYMENT, COULD OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN
      RECEIVED BY THE BANK OVER THE SHORTER OF THE REMAINING CONTRACTUAL LIFE OF
      THE NOTE OR NEXT REPRICING DATE IF THE BANK HAD INSTEAD INITIALLY INVESTED
      THE NOTE PROCEEDS AT THE INITIAL MONEY MARKET RATE. THE INDIVIDUAL
      DISCOUNT RATE USED TO PRESENT VALUE EACH PROSPECTIVE PAYMENT OF INTEREST
      AND/OR PRINCIPAL SHALL BE THE MONEY MARKET RATE AT PREPAYMENT FOR THE
      MATURITY MATCHING THAT OF EACH SPECIFIC PAYMENT OF PRINCIPAL AND/OR
      INTEREST.

      "INITIAL MONEY MARKET RATE" SHALL MEAN THE RATE PER ANNUM, DETERMINED
      SOLELY BY THE BANK, ON THE FIRST DAY OF THE TERM OF THIS NOTE OR THE MOST
      RECENT REPRICING DATE OR AS MUTUALLY AGREED UPON BY THE BORROWER AND THE
      BANK, AS THE RATE AT WHICH THE BANK WOULD BE ABLE TO BORROW FUNDS IN MONEY
      MARKETS FOR THE AMOUNT OF THIS NOTE AND WITH AN INTEREST PAYMENT FREQUENCY
      AND PRINCIPAL REPAYMENT SCHEDULE EQUAL TO THIS NOTE AND FOR A TERM AS MAY
      BE ARRANGED AND AGREED UPON BY THE BORROWER AND THE BANK. SUCH A RATE
      SHALL INCLUDE FDIC INSURANCE, RESERVE REQUIREMENTS AND OTHER EXPLICIT OR
      IMPLICIT COSTS LEVIED BY ANY REGULATORY AGENCY. BORROWER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT
      THE BANK IS UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO ACTUALLY PURCHASE AND/OR MATCH FUNDS
      FOR THE INITIAL MONEY MARKET RATE OF THIS NOTE.

      "MONEY MARKET RATE AT PREPAYMENT" SHALL MEAN THAT ZERO-COUPON RATE,
      CALCULATED ON THE DATE OF PREPAYMENT, AND DETERMINED SOLELY BY THE BANK,
      AS THE RATE IN WHICH THE BANK WOULD BE ABLE TO BORROW FUNDS IN MONEY
      MARKETS FOR THE PREPAYMENT AMOUNT MATCHING THE MATURITY OF A SPECIFIC
      PROSPECTIVE NOTE PAYMENT OR REPRICING DATE. SUCH A RATE SHALL INCLUDE FDIC
      INSURANCE, RESERVE REQUIREMENTS AND OTHER EXPLICIT OR IMPLICIT COSTS
      LEVIED BY ANY REGULATORY AGENCY. A SEPARATE MONEY MARKET RATE AT
      PREPAYMENT WILL BE CALCULATED FOR EACH PROSPECTIVE INTEREST AND/OR
      PRINCIPAL PAYMENT DATE.

      "MONEY MARKETS" SHALL MEAN ONE OR MORE WHOLESALE FUNDING MECHANISMS
      AVAILABLE TO THE BANK, INCLUDING NEGOTIABLE CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT,
      EURODOLLAR DEPOSITS, BANK NOTES, FED FUNDS, INTEREST RATE SWAPS, OR
      OTHERS.

IN CALCULATING THE AMOUNT OF SUCH A PREPAYMENT FEE, THE BANK IS HEREBY
AUTHORIZED BY THE BORROWER TO MAKE SUCH ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING THE SOURCE OF
FUNDING, REDEPLOYMENT OF FUNDS AND OTHER RELATED MATTERS, AS THE BANK MAY DEEM
APPROPRIATE. IF THE BORROWER FAILS TO PAY ANY PREPAYMENT FEE WHEN DUE, THE
AMOUNT OF SUCH PREPAYMENT FEE SHALL THEREAFTER BEAR INTEREST UNTIL PAID AT THE
DEFAULT RATE SPECIFIED IN THIS NOTE (COMPUTED ON THE BASIS OF A 360-DAY YEAR,
ACTUAL DAYS ELAPSED). ANY PREPAYMENT OF PRINCIPAL SHALL BE ACCOMPANIED BY A
PAYMENT OF INTEREST ACCRUED TO DATE THEREON; AND SAID PREPAYMENT SHALL BE
APPLIED TO THE PRINCIPAL INSTALLMENTS IN THE INVERSE ORDER OF THEIR MATURITIES.
ALL PREPAYMENTS SHALL BE IN AN AMOUNT OF AT LEAST $100,000 OR IF LESS, THE
REMAINING ENTIRE PRINCIPAL BALANCE OF THE LOAN.
