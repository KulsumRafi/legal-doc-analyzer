</FONT>

<P align="left">
<B><U><FONT size="2">Subject: Proposed Arrangement with Zemex
Corporation</FONT></U></B>

<P align="left">
<FONT size="2">We refer to the arrangement agreement (the
&#147;Arrangement Agreement&#148;) proposed to be entered into
between Zemex Corporation (&#147;Zemex&#148;), Cementos
Pacasmayo S.A.A. (&#147;Parentco&#148;) and 6012639 Canada Inc.
(&#147;Subco&#148;) providing for the acquisition by Subco of
all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Zemex (the
&#147;Arrangement&#148;).
</FONT>

<P align="left">
<FONT size="2">We represent and warrant that: (i)&nbsp;we
beneficially own 3,055,176&nbsp;common shares of Zemex (the
&#147;Securities&#148;) with good and marketable title thereto
and free and clear of any encumbrances or any other rights or
claims of others; and (ii)&nbsp;we have full power and authority
to fulfill our obligations hereunder and doing so will not
violate or conflict with applicable law or any agreement
instrument or document to which we are party or by which we are
bound.
</FONT>

<P align="left">
<FONT size="2">We understand that you wish to have our agreement
that we support the Arrangement and will not conduct ourselves
in a manner that is inconsistent with the completion with the
Arrangement. Accordingly, we covenant and agree that, during the
period from the date of this letter to the Letter Termination
(as hereinafter defined), we will: (i)&nbsp;not sell, option,
transfer or otherwise encumber the Securities or any interest
therein; (ii)&nbsp;not solicit a competing transaction or
otherwise knowingly take any action of any kind which is
reasonably likely to reduce the likelihood of success of the
Arrangement; (iii)&nbsp;not grant or agree to grant any proxy or
other right to vote the Securities, or enter into any voting
trust, vote pooling or other agreement with respect to the right
to vote, call meetings of securityholders or give consents or
approvals of any kind as to the Securities; (iv)&nbsp;not do
indirectly anything that we have agreed not to do directly in
this Agreement; and (v)&nbsp;deposit all of the Securities,
together with a duly completed and executed letter of
transmittal, with the depositary specified in the plan of
Arrangement in accordance with the terms thereof.
</FONT>

<P align="left">
<FONT size="2">In addition, we irrevocably covenant and agree in
favour of Parentco and Subco that, unless the Letter Termination
has occurred: (i)&nbsp;we will vote or to cause to be voted the
Securities in favour of the Arrangement and all other matters
related thereto including in connection with any separate vote
of any sub-group of securityholders that may be required to be
taken and of which sub-group we form a part; (ii)&nbsp;we will
not exercise any rights of dissent provided under the
Arrangement, any applicable laws or otherwise in connection with
the Arrangement or any other corporate transaction considered at
the Special Meeting of Zemex in connection with the Arrangement.

<P align="left">
<FONT size="2">Notwithstanding any other provision of this
letter, our obligations hereunder shall automatically terminate
(the &#147;Letter Termination&#148;): (i)&nbsp;if the
Arrangement Agreement is amended without our prior written
consent to reduce the amount of the consideration payable
thereunder in respect of the Securities; (ii)&nbsp;if the
Arrangement Agreement is terminated for any reason;
(iii)&nbsp;if the directors of Zemex withdraw their approval of
the Arrangement or approve or recommend any Competing Proposal
(as defined in the Arrangement Agreement; or (iv)&nbsp;if the
representations and warranties of each of Parentco and Subco as
set forth in the Arrangement Agreement are not true and correct
or Parentco or Subco have not complied with all of their
covenants to Zemex contained in the Arrangement Agreement and
such non-compliance has not been curred within five business
days after receipt of written notice of such non-compliance,
delivered by us or Zemex.

<P align="left">
<FONT size="2">We confirm that this letter agreement constitutes
our legal, valid and binding obligation and is enforceable
against us in accordance with its terms. We also recognize and
acknowledge that this Agreement is an integral part of the
transactions contemplated in the Arrangement Agreement, that
Parentco and Subco will not enter into the Arrangement Agreement
unless this Agreement is executed, and accordingly acknowledge
and agree that a breach by us of any covenants or other
commitments contained in this Agreement will cause Parentco and
Subco to sustain injury for which they would not have an
adequate remedy at law for money damages. Therefore, we agree
that in the event of any such breach, you shall be entitled to
the remedy of specific performance of such covenants or
commitments and preliminary and permanent injunctive and other
equitable relief in addition to any other remedy to which you
may be entitled, at law or in equity and further agree to waive
any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in
connection with the obtaining of any such injunctive or
equitable relief.

in accordance with the laws of the Province of Ontario and the
federal laws of Canada applicable therein.

the Arrangement.
