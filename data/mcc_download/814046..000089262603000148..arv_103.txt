ARTICLE III - FUTURE COMMUNITIES

     SECTION 3.1   For so long as this Agreement is in effect, the
Partnership will be entitled to receive a 10% interest in the net cash flow
of each property development developed by Arvida under the name "Arvida"
and using the personnel of Arvida, which are in the nature of master
planned residential communities (other than those Communities and other
assets acquired under, or as contemplated by, the Acquisition Agreement,or
as contemplated by the Prospectus (as hereinafter defined) which Arvida
acquires (or enters into an option to acquire) the right to develop on or
prior to the fourth anniversary of the date of the first admission to the
Partnership of holders of Assignee Limited Partnership Interests as
contemplated by the Partnership's prospectus (the "Prospectus") contained
in Registration Statement No. 33-14091 on Form S-1 (a "Future Community")
after payment of all costs and expenses and the return (the "Preferred
Return") to Arvida and its affiliates (including JMB Realty Corporation) of
cash flow equal to (i) their capital investment in any such Future
Community plus a 12% per annum cumulative, non-compounded return thereon
plus (ii) an amount equal to 2% per annum on a cumulative, non-compounded
basis of the amount of any indebtedness with respect to such Future
Community which was guaranteed by, or otherwise was recourse to, Arvida or
its affiliates; provided, however, that the Partnership's right to receive
any such 10% of net cash flow shall be reduced (but not below zero) to the
extent that, at any time such net cash flow would otherwise be
distributable, the then fair market value (as determined by the General
Partner) of all such Future Communities on any date on which distribution
would otherwise be made is less than an amount equal to the aggregate costs
and expenses related to the evaluation, selection and development of all
such Future Communities or potential Future Communities, including the
Preferred Return.  In the event of any such reduction, the costs of other
Future Communities and potential Future Communities shall be reduced pro
rata by the reduction in net cash flow in which the Partnership would
otherwise participate.  The interest of the Partnership in Future
Communities may take the form of a limited partnership interest.  Net cash

flow with respect to such Future Communities shall mean all cash receipts,
including the proceeds of any financing, less all operating and other
expenses (including salary and salary related expenses, rent, utilities and
other costs relating to the management, administration, evaluation,
selection and development of all such Future Communities), all debt service
(including principal and interest) and less additions to cash reserves,
exclusive of any amounts distributed to unaffiliated third-party joint
venturers.


     SECTION 3.2   In connection with such activities involving Future
Communities, Arvida shall, on behalf of the owner or owners of such Future
Communities, investigate, select and conduct, all necessary relations with
third parties in respect thereof, and enter into appropriate contracts
with, or employ, retain or obtain services performed or to be performed by,
any such parties in connection with any (i) such Future Communities, or
(ii) mortgages or other investments acquired, sold or otherwise disposed of
or committed, negotiated, or contemplated to be acquired, sold or otherwise
disposed of by such owner or owners of Future Communities.


     SECTION 3.3   The Partnership shall not participate in any future
real estate developments or projects other than its interest in the net
cash flow of Future Community developments as provided herein.


     SECTION 3.4   It is understood that Arvida and affiliates of Arvida
may perform services similar in nature to those to be performed hereunder
for other partnerships, corporations, trusts or other entities in the
future, including entities which are affiliated with or sponsored by Arvida
or JMB or their affiliates.

regarding the Partnership's requirements for each Property.


     SECTION 4.2  The Partnership shall designate, when necessary, a

to each Property.  The Partnership or such authorized representative shall

notice of termination from the General Partner to Arvida, if any of the
following events shall happen:

           (a)   If Arvida shall violate any material provision of this
     Agreement, and after having notice of such violation, Arvida fails to
     cure such violation within thirty (30) days; or

EXHIBIT A





                           LICENSE AGREEMENT
                           -----------------


     Agreement by and between Arvida Management Company, an Illinois
corporation ("Arvida"), and Arvida/JMB Partners, L.P., a limited
partnership organized and operating under the laws of Delaware
("Licensee").

     WHEREAS, Arvida owns tradenames, trademarks and service marks in
respect of the name "Arvida" that it has used in connection with its
business activities including marks that are registered with state and
federal authorities as well as common law rights in those and other marks
and it is expected that Arvida may hereafter acquire ownership of
additional names, marks and registrations using the name "Arvida" (all such
names and marks using the "Arvida" name, including both registered and
common law marks, whether now owned or hereafter acquired being hereinafter
referred to collectively as "Marks"); and

     WHEREAS, Arvida and Licensee have executed a Management, Advisory and
Supervisory Agreement (the "Supervisory Agreement") to which this License
Agreement is Exhibit A, and Arvida and Licensee wish to enable Licensee to
use such Marks in connection with Licensee's business activities upon the
terms and conditions hereinafter set forth.

     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual
promises and covenants herein contained, and other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged,
the parties hereto covenant and agree as follows:

     1.    GRANT OF NON-EXCLUSIVE LICENSEE

           Upon the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth, Arvida
hereby grants to Licensee and Licensee hereby accepts a non-exclusive,
non-transferable license to use the Marks, in connection with Licensee's
business operations, including use of such Marks as part of Licensee's name
as well as their use for identification of Licensee's properties or
facilities contained therein, including but not limited to hotels, clubs,
commercial buildings and other similar properties or facilities.  Licensee
shall have no interest in or right to use the Marks except as set forth
herein.  This License extends to any and all Marks now owned or hereafter
acquired by Arvida to the date of expiration or termination of this
Agreement.





















                                   1


<PAGE>


     2.    NON-EXCLUSIVITY OF LICENSE

           Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent Arvida from granting
any other licenses for the use of the Marks or from utilizing the Marks or
permitting the Marks to be utilized by others in any manner whatsoever.


     3.    TERM

           The term of this License shall continue in force for as long as
the Supervisory Agreement shall be in effect, subject to earlier
termination in accordance with the provisions thereof and hereof.


     4.    OWNERSHIP OF MARKS

           Licensee specifically acknowledges Arvida's ownership rights in
the Marks.  In connection with the use of the Marks Licensee shall not in
any manner represent that it has any ownership in the Marks or any
registrations thereof and agrees that nothing in this Agreement shall give
Licensee any ownership interest in any of the Marks other than the right to
use the Marks in accordance with this Agreement.

           Licensee will not, during the term of this Agreement or at any
time thereafter, attack the validity of any of the Marks or Arvida's
interests therein, nor will it attach any application for registration of
any of the Marks, or take any position contrary to that of Arvida in any
proceedings pertaining to registration of any of the Marks.

           Licensee shall, whether during or after the term of this
Agreement, execute and deliver to Arvida such documents as Arvida may
reasonably request to establish or confirm Arvida's ownership interest in
the Marks.


     5.    QUALITY CONTROL

           Licensee hereby agrees that it will follow the same quality
standards that Arvida's predecessors have heretofore used in connection
with any uses of any of the Marks licensed hereunder.  Licensee agrees that
it will make no uses of the Marks that it believes would reflect adversely
upon Arvida and that it will obtain Arvida's prior approval of the quality
standards to be employed in connection with any uses of any of such Marks
differing from prior uses made by Arvida's predecessors.  Arvida shall have
the right upon request to review all uses of any of such Marks as well as
the right to inspect (upon reasonable notice) any properties or other
products connected in any way with Licensee's uses of the Marks.























                                   2


<PAGE>


           Licensee agrees that Arvida shall have total discretion to
determine the propriety of any usage of any of such Marks or the quality
standards to be employed in respect thereof and Licensee agrees to forego
any objectionable use of the Marks upon written notification to Licensee
from Arvida that such use is objectionable.  Once Arvida has notified
Licensee that it deems a particular usage of the Marks objectionable, any
repetition of such objectionable usage by Licensee after it has received
reasonable notice that Arvida objects to such use shall entitle Arvida in
its sole discretion to terminate this Agreement and any and all rights
granted to Licensee hereunder pursuant to paragraphs 9.b. and 10 hereof.


     6.    ASSIGNMENT OR SUBLICENSE BY LICENSEE

           This Agreement and all rights and duties in and with respect to
the Marks hereunder are personal to Licensee and shall not, without the
prior written consent of Arvida, which consent may be withheld in Arvida's
sole discretion, be assigned, mortgaged, sublicensed or otherwise
encumbered or transferred by Licensee or by operation of law.  Arvida,
however, may assign this Agreement and/or its rights and duties hereunder
to any person or entity without the consent of Licensee and upon such
assignment Arvida shall be relieved from any further liability under this
Agreement.  Arvida shall furnish written notice of any such assignment to
Licensee.


     7.    UNAUTHORIZED USE

           Licensee will notify Arvida in writing of any unauthorized use
of any of the Marks which come to Licensee's attention and Arvida will
proceed diligently, at its own expense and under its sole control, to
prevent any such unauthorized use of the Marks.  In the event that Arvida
does not proceed diligently to prevent unauthorized use of the Marks,
Licensee shall have the right, at its own expense and under its sole
control, to proceed in its own name to prevent unauthorized use of the
Marks and, if required by law, to name Arvida as a co- plaintiff in any
such proceeding.


     8.    INFRINGEMENT

           Licensee will notify Arvida promptly in writing of any claim
that the use of any of the Marks infringes the rights of others, or of the
institution of any legal actions or suits predicated upon such claimed
infringement, and any such suit or action will be diligently defended at
the sole expense of and under the sole control of Arvida.

     9.    TERMINATION

           a.    This Agreement shall remain in effect throughout the term
                 stated in paragraph 3 above until and unless it is
                 earlier terminated pursuant to the terms of paragraph
                 9(b) below.

           b.    This Agreement may be terminated as follows:

                 i.   By Arvida in the event that Licensee shall fail or
                      threaten to fail to perform any obligation imposed
                      upon Licensee by this Agreement or violate any
                      terms of this Agreement.  Arvida will give Licensee
                      written notice setting forth the particulars of any
                      such breach and, unless Licensee has cured such
                      breach or is in the process of curing such breach
                      (in the sole judgment of Arvida), this Agreement
                      will terminate thirty (30) days after receipt by
                      Licensee of such written notice.

                 ii.  In the event that the Supervisory Agreement
                      terminates for any reason, or in the event of its
                      expiration, this License Agreement shall
                      immediately and automatically terminate.


     10.   EFFECT OF TERMINATION OR EXPIRATION

           On termination or expiration of this Agreement, all rights and
licenses granted to Licensee hereunder shall immediately and automatically
terminate.  In such event, Licensee agrees, to discontinue all uses of the
Marks and any words confusingly similar thereto within ninety (90) days of
such termination or expiration, including but not limited to changing the
name of Arvida/JMB Partners, L.P. to a name not containing the name
"Arvida" or any name or names similar thereto, and sufficiently dissimilar
to such name as to be unlikely to cause confusion with such name.  Neither
Licensee nor any affiliate of Licensee shall allude in any public statement
or advertisement to the former name, except as necessary to announce the
change in the Partnership's name (or the name of such affiliate) and as
required by applicable law.  Licensee agrees that it will at no future time
adopt or use, without Arvida's prior written consent, a word or mark which
is reasonably likely to be similar to or confusing with any of the Marks.
Arvida shall retain sole authority and control over the use of its name and
over all of the Marks, and all rights in the Marks shall remain the
property of Arvida.

     11.   ROYALTY

           The license granted herein shall be royalty-free.


     12.   RESERVATION OF RIGHTS IN THE LICENSED MARKS

           Rights in the Marks, other than those specifically granted
herein, are reserved by Arvida for its own use.  Upon the termination of
this Agreement for any reason whatsoever, all rights to the Marks shall
revert to Arvida without the necessity of any act on its part.


     13.   UNENFORCEABLE PROVISIONS

           If any provision of this Agreement, or any part hereof, is
declared unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, each and every
other provision, or part hereof, shall continue in full force and effect.


     14.   NOTICES

           All notices or communications required or permitted to be given
under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be conclusively deemed
to have been received by a party hereto and to be effective in the manner
and as provided for in the Supervisory Agreement.


     15.   WAIVER

           The failure or delay of Arvida or Licensee to insist upon the
performance of any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement or to
exercise or enforce any right or obligation herein conferred, shall not be
construed to be a waiver of any such terms, conditions, rights or
obligations and either party may, within the time provided by applicable
law, take measures to enforce any or all such rights and obligations.


     16.   GOVERNING LAW

           This Agreement shall be construed and interpreted in accordance
with, and be governed by, the laws of the State of Illinois as of the time
in effect.


     17.   REMEDIES

           In the event of the breach or default in the terms of this
Agreement by either party, the non-breaching or non-defaulting party shall
be entitled to all legal and equitable remedies provided by law.




















                                   5


<PAGE>


           The parties to this Agreement agree that damages may be
insufficient to compensate Arvida in the event that any of the terms of the
Agreement are not complied with, and therefore agree that in such event,
Arvida may seek injunctive relief and specific performance of the terms
hereof, in addition to all other rights or remedies, and that to obtain
such an injunction Arvida shall not be required to show any actual damage
or to post any bond or other security.


     18.   HEADINGS

           The headings in this Agreement are intended solely for
convenience of reference and shall be given no effect in the interpretation
of this Agreement.


     19.   ENTIRE AGREEMENT

           This Agreement and the Supervisory Agreement contain the entire
understanding between the respective parties hereto with respect to the
subject matter hereof.  Neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof may
be modified, amended, changed, waived or discharged orally, but only by an
instrument in writing signed by the party against whom enforcement of the
modification, amendment, change, waiver or discharge is sought. However, in
the case of automatic termination of this Agreement, no writing shall be
required in order to effect such termination, except as otherwise expressly
provided herein.
