<PAGE>

     6.1 Granting of Restricted Stock. The Committee is authorized to make
Grants of Restricted Stock to Eligible Employees in such amounts, and subject to
such terms and conditions, as the Committee shall from time to time determine in
its sole discretion, subject to the terms of this Plan.

     6.2 Restricted Stock Agreements. The granting of Restricted Stock to an
Eligible Employee under this Plan shall be contingent on such Eligible Employee
executing a Restricted Stock Agreement in the form prescribed by the Committee.
Each Restricted Stock Agreement shall: (i) indicate the number of shares of
Restricted Stock which will be granted to the Eligible Employee; (ii) include
provisions reflecting the transfer restrictions imposed upon Restricted Stock
under this Plan and the provisions for lapse of those restrictions under this
Plan; and (iii) include any other terms, conditions or restrictions the

and deliver to the Company a Stock Power in blank with respect to Restricted
Stock granted to such Eligible Employees. The Committee may, in its sole
discretion, deposit Restricted Stock certificates with an escrow agent in

the Restricted Stock certificates.

     6.4 Rights of Grantees. Subject to the terms, conditions and restrictions
specified under this Plan and applicable Restricted Stock Agreements, the
Restricted Stock granted under this Plan shall be considered as issued and
outstanding and fully paid and non-assessable for all purposes. Notwithstanding
retention of Restricted Stock certificates by the

                                      (8)
<PAGE>

Company or an escrow agent, Grantees shall have all rights with respect to their
Restricted Stock (subject to the terms, conditions and restrictions specified
under this Plan and any applicable Restricted Stock Agreement) including:

        (a)     Title. Subject to the Grantee's execution of a Stock Power, any
                Restricted Stock granted under this Plan shall be held by the
                Company or in escrow under the Grantee's name.

        (b)     Voting Rights. Subject to the Grantee's execution of a Stock
                Power, a Grantee shall be entitled to vote any Restricted Stock
                granted to him under this Plan.

        (c)     Dividends. As of the date any dividend is paid on any Restricted
                Shares under this Plan, the Grantee having title to such
                Restricted Stock shall be credited with a dividend equivalent
                credit under the Deferred Compensation Plan in such manner, and
                in such amount, as is provided in the Deferred Compensation Plan
                for dividends paid on Restricted Shares thereunder.

                                   ARTICLE VII

                               STOCK RESTRICTIONS

     7.1 Transfer Restrictions. Restricted Stock shall not be sold, transferred
or otherwise disposed of and shall not be pledged or otherwise hypothecated (and
any such sale, transfer or other disposition, pledge or other hypothecation
being hereinafter referred to as "to dispose of" or a "disposition") until the
earliest of: (i) a Change in Control (as described in Sections 9.3 & 9.4); (ii)
a Grantee experiencing a Termination of Employment due to death or total
disability (as described in Section 9.2); (iii) the restrictions on such
Restricted Stock lapse in accordance with Article VIII; or (iv) termination of
the Plan.

     7.2 Other Restrictions. The Committee may impose restrictions on Restricted
Stock in addition to, or different from, those described in this Plan, as it
deems necessary or appropriate. Grants are not required to be made with the same
terms, conditions or restrictions. Grants may vary from time to time and from
Grantee to Grantee.

                                      (9)
<PAGE>

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                              LAPSE OF RESTRICTIONS

     8.1 Lapse of Restrictions After Ten Years of Continuous Employment. If a
Grantee remains in Continuous Employment from June 1, 2002 until May 31, 2012,
subject to all of the other provisions of this Plan, all restrictions imposed
upon Restricted Stock awarded to him pursuant to this Plan shall lapse and be of
no further force and effect. In the event of Termination of Employment prior to
May 31, 2012, the status of the restrictions imposed upon such Grantee's
Restricted Stock upon Termination of Employment shall be governed by Article IX.

     8.2 Performance Accelerated Lapse of Restrictions. All restrictions on the
Restricted Stock granted pursuant to this Plan, whether contained in this Plan
or a Restricted Stock Agreement, shall lapse upon attainment of all Performance
Goals during any Plan Year beginning prior to June 1, 2011, as determined in
accordance with Section 8.3. The term "Performance Goals" shall mean such
financial or other goals as determined by the Committee and set forth in a
Restricted Stock Agreement.

     8.3 Determination of Achievement of Performance Goals. Notwithstanding
anything contained in this Plan to the contrary, the Committee shall have sole
and exclusive authority to determine whether Performance Goals have been
satisfied. The Committee may, in its sole and exclusive discretion, adjust any
criteria or measure used to determine satisfaction of Performance Goals for any
Plan Year, solely for purposes of this Plan, to account for the effect of
acquisitions, divestitures, substantial asset sales, the payment of debt, the
classification of normal operating expenses as "unusual charges" for accounting
purposes, the use of non-standard accounting methodologies, changes in
accounting principles, or other extraordinary  or

                                      (10)
<PAGE>

non-recurring events. In making any such adjustment, the Committee may rely upon
the opinion of outside service providers to the extent it deems necessary or
appropriate.

     8.4 Delivery of Restricted Stock Upon Lapse of Restrictions. As promptly as
practicable following a determination by the Committee that Performance Goals
have been satisfied, the Committee shall cause certificates for all Restricted
Stock, which certificates have been in the physical custody of the Company or an
escrow agent, to be issued to the appropriate Grantees, with any legend making
reference to the various restrictions imposed hereunder removed.

                                   ARTICLE IX

                            TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT

     9.1 Termination of Employment for Reasons Other Than Change of Control,
Death or Disability. Except as otherwise provided in Sections 9.2 through 9.4,
in the event a Grantee experiences a Termination of Employment, any Restricted
Stock granted hereunder which is not unrestricted upon Termination of Employment
shall be forfeited and returned to the Company pursuant to a Stock Power.

     9.2 Termination of Employment Due to Death or Disability. Notwithstanding
Section 9.1 to the contrary, in the event a Grantee experiences a Termination of
Employment by reason of death or total disability (as defined under the
Company's group long-term disability plan), any Restricted Stock granted
hereunder shall be deemed to be unrestricted, meaning that all restrictions
imposed on such Restricted Stock shall lapse and be of no further force and
effect. The Committee has the authority to determine whether a Grantee is
totally disabled.

     9.3 Termination of Employment Due to Change in Control. Notwithstanding
Section 9.1 to the contrary, in the event of a Change in Control as described in
Sections 9.3 and

                                      (11)
<PAGE>

9.4, any Restricted Stock granted hereunder shall be deemed to be unrestricted,
meaning that all restrictions imposed on such Restricted Stock shall lapse and
be of no further force and effect. The Committee has the authority to determine
whether a Change in Control has occurred.

     9.4 Definition of "Change in Control". A "Change in Control" shall be
deemed to have occurred upon the occurrence of any of the following events:

        (a)     The Company is merged or consolidated or reorganized into or
                with another corporation or other legal person or entity (other
                than Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent), and as a result of
                such merger, consolidation or reorganization less than a
                majority of the combined voting power of the then-outstanding

                aggregate by the holders of Voting Stock immediately prior to
                such sale or transfer;

        (c)     There is a report filed on Schedule 13D or Schedule TO (or any

                Exchange Act but excluding Parent and any Subsidiary of Parent)
                has become the beneficial owner (as the term "beneficial owner"
                is defined under Rule 13d-3 or any successor rule or regulation

                successor schedule, form or report or item therein) that a
                change in control of the Company has or may have occurred or
                will or may occur in the future pursuant to any then- existing

disclosing beneficial ownership by it of shares of Voting Stock or because the
Company reports that a change in control of the Company has or may have occurred
or will or may occur in the future by reason of such beneficial ownership, (ii)
solely because any other person or entity either files or becomes obligated to
file a report on Schedule 13D or Schedule TO (or any successor schedule, form or
report) under the Exchange Act, disclosing beneficial ownership by it of shares
of Voting Stock, but only if both (A) the transaction giving rise to such filing
or obligation is approved in advance of consummation thereof by the Company's
Board of Directors and (B) at least a majority of the Voting Power immediately
after such transaction is held in the aggregate by the holders of Voting Stock
immediately prior to such transaction, or (iii) solely because of a change in

                  COORDINATION WITH DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN

     14.1. Credit to Deferred Compensation Plan Determined by Committee. In the
event that an Eligible Employee receives a Grant of Restricted Stock, has not
made an election under Section 83(b) of the Code and will be in receipt of an
amount of compensation in excess of

                                      (16)
<PAGE>

the amount that may be deducted under Section 162(m) of the Code upon lapse of
the restrictions, the Committee shall have the right and authority to cancel
such number of shares of Restricted Stock as is necessary so that the
compensation amount attributable to the remaining Restricted Stock that will
become unrestricted on or before the next immediate May 31 will be deductible by
the Company after taking into account Section 162(m) of the Code, and the
Eligible Employee shall automatically have the same number of shares of
Restricted Stock credited to his Restricted Stock Account under the Deferred
Compensation Plan. The Committee may determine to make such a cancellation at
any time, but not later than ten (10) days prior to the date the restrictions
for such Restricted Stock lapse. The Eligible Employee shall be notified in
writing of any such cancellation and shall be subject to such further
requirements as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion.

     14.2. Credit to Deferred Compensation Plan Determined by Grantee. In the
event that an Eligible Employee receives a Grant of Restricted Stock, has not
made an election under Section 83(b) of the Code and will be in receipt of an
amount of compensation upon lapse of such restrictions, the Grantee may elect to
surrender, as of a date specified in his election, any of the Restricted Stock
awarded under this Plan and the Grantee shall automatically have the same number
of shares of Restricted Stock credited to his Restricted Stock Account under the
Deferred Compensation Plan. For an election to be valid, it must be made in
accordance with the terms and conditions imposed by the Committee and the
requirements of the Deferred Compensation Plan. The surrender election with
respect to the Restricted Stock must be delivered to and accepted by the
Committee at least six (6) months prior to the date all restrictions with
respect to the Restricted Stock lapse.

<PAGE>

     14.3 Vesting of Canceled or Surrendered Restricted Stock. An employee shall
be vested in shares of Restricted Stock or amounts credited to his Account
Balance under the Deferred Compensation Plan as a result of cancellation or
surrender of Restricted Stock under this Plan when restrictions on the cancelled
or surrendered Restricted Stock would have lapsed under this Plan.

                                   ARTICLE XV

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

     15.1 Consents. If the Committee shall at any time determine that any
Consent (as defined below) is necessary or desirable as a condition to, or in
connection with, any Grant under the Plan, the issuance of Common Shares or
other rights thereunder or the taking of any other action thereunder (each such
action being hereinafter referred to as a "Plan Action"), then such Plan Action
shall not be taken, in whole or in part, unless and until such Consent shall
have been effected or obtained to the full satisfaction of the Committee, or the
Committee may require that such Plan Action be taken only in such manner as to
make such Consent unnecessary.

     The term "Consent" as used herein with respect to any Plan Action means (i)
any and all listings, registrations or qualifications in respect thereof upon
any securities exchange or under any federal, state or local law, rule or
regulation, (ii) any and all written agreements and representations by the
Grantee with respect to the acquisition or disposition of Common Shares, or with
respect to any other matter, which the Committee shall deem necessary or
desirable to comply with the terms of any such listing, registration or
qualification or to obtain an exemption from the requirement that any such
listing, qualification or registration be made and (iii) any and all consents,
clearances and approvals by any governmental or other regulatory bodies.

                                      (18)
<PAGE>

     15.2 Right of Discharge Reserved. Nothing in the Plan or in any Restricted
Stock Agreement shall be construed to confer upon any Eligible Employee the
right to continue in the employment or service of the Company or any Subsidiary,
or to be employed or serve in any particular position therewith, or affect any
right which the Company or any Subsidiary may have to terminate the employment
or service of such Eligible Employee.

     15.3  Nature of Grants.

        (a)     Any and all Grants and issuances of Restricted Stock hereunder
                shall be in consideration of services performed for the Company
                or for a Subsidiary by the Grantee.

        (b)     All Grants hereunder shall constitute a special incentive to the
                Grantee and shall not be taken into account in computing the
                amount of salary or compensation of the Grantee for purposes of
                determining any pension, retirement, death or other benefits
                under (i) any pension, retirement, profit-sharing, bonus, life
                insurance or other benefit plan of the Company or any Subsidiary
                or (ii) any agreement between the Company or any Subsidiary, on
                the one hand, and the Grantee, on the other hand, except as such
                plan or agreement shall otherwise expressly provide.

     15.4 Non-Uniform Determinations and Restricted Stock Agreements. The
Company's, Board's or Committee's determinations under the Plan need not be
uniform and may be made selectively among Eligible Employees who receive, or are
eligible to receive, Grants under the Plan (whether or not such persons are
similarly situated). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Company, Board and Committee shall be entitled, among other things, to make
non-uniform and selective determinations, and to enter into non-uniform and
selective Restricted Stock Agreements as to (i) the persons to receive Grants
under the Plan, and (ii) the terms, conditions and restrictions of Grants under
the Plan.

     15.5 Other Payments or Awards. Nothing contained in the Plan shall be
deemed to in any way limit or restrict the Company, any Subsidiary, the Board or
the Committee

                                      (19)
<PAGE>

from making any award or payment to any person under any other plan, arrangement
or understanding, whether now existing or hereafter in effect.

     15.6  Section Headings.  The section headings contained herein are for
purposes of convenience only and are not intended to define or limit the
contents of said sections.

     15.7  Number.  The singular herein shall include the plural, or vice versa,
wherever the context so requires.

     15.8 Gender. A pronoun in the masculine, feminine, or neuter gender shall
be deemed, where appropriate, to include also the masculine, feminine or neuter
gender.

     15.9 Withholding. The Company may withhold, or require a Grantee to remit
to the Company, an amount sufficient to satisfy any applicable federal, state or
local withholding tax requirement.

     15.10 Waiver. No waiver of any term or provision of this Plan by the
Company, any Subsidiary, Board or Committee will constitute a waiver of the same
term or provision in any subsequent case.

     15.11  Governing Law.  This Plan shall be governed by, construed and
enforced in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Ohio, without
reference to principles of conflict of laws.
