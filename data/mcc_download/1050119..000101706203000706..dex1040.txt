     (d)  a disposal or supply or deemed disposal or supply by any member of the
          Group of assets goods services or business facilities of any kind

     (j)  an Event giving rise to a balancing charge.

4    Credit for Tax Savings

4.1  For the purposes of this clause 4:

     (a)  "Prior Liability" means a Tax Liability of any member of the Group in
          respect of which the Sellers have made payment to the Purchaser under
          this Deed;

     (b)  "Tax Saving" means the reduction or elimination on or before the
          seventh anniversary of this Deed of any Tax Liability of any member of
          the Group to the extent that such reduction or elimination would not
          have occurred but for the payment or discharge by that Group member of
          a Prior Liability; and

     (c)  any member of the Group shall be regarded as obtaining the benefit of
          a Tax Saving on the last day on which (but for the Relief giving rise
          to the Tax Saving) it would have been obliged to make an actual
          payment of Tax in order to avoid incurring a liability to interest or
          a charge fine or penalty in respect of that Tax.

4.2  The Purchaser shall use its reasonable endeavours to procure that the
     benefit of any Tax Saving is obtained as early as possible provided that
     nothing in this clause 4 shall require the Purchaser or any member of the
     Group to manage their tax affairs in a way which, in the reasonable opinion
     of the Purchaser, would prevent optimum use of any Reliefs available.

4.3  If the Purchaser becomes aware that a Tax Saving has arisen it will notify
     the Sellers as soon as practicable. If (at the cost and expense of the
     Sellers) the auditors for the time being of the relevant member of the
     Group certify that such Group member has obtained the benefit of a Tax
     Saving, then the Purchaser shall repay to the Sellers an amount equal to
     the lesser of:

     (a)  the amount of such Tax Saving (as certified by the auditors); and

     (b)  (to the extent not already refunded) the amount(s) previously paid by
          Sellers to the Purchaser under this Deed in respect of the Prior
          Liability in question.

4.4  To the extent that there is an excess after payment under clause 4.3 above
     has been made a refund shall be made to the Sellers of any previous payment
     or payments by the Sellers under this Deed or the Agreement and not
     previously refunded under clause 4.3 above up to the amount of such excess.

4.5  To the extent that the excess referred to in clause 4.4 is not exhausted
     under that clause 4.4 the remainder of that excess shall be carried forward
     and set off against any future payment or payments which become due from
     the Sellers under this Deed or the Agreement.

4.6  The amount of any Tax Saving (or the Relief giving rise to such Tax Saving)
     shall not be increased by:

     (a)  any Accounts Relief ; or


                                       5

<PAGE>

     (b)  any surrender or claim to surrender any amount by way of group relief,
          surplus advance corporation tax or tax refund; or

     (c)  any change in Tax Legislation or rates of Tax announced after
          Completion.

5    No Disclosures
     --------------

5.1  Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Deed, the Purchaser shall be
     entitled to make a claim under this Deed in respect of a Tax Liability
     notwithstanding that:

     (a)  the Purchaser had knowledge (whether actual constructive or implied)
          on or before Completion of that Tax Liability (or the matter giving
          rise to the Tax Liability); or

     (b)  such Tax Liability has been paid or discharged by any member of the
          Group whether before or after Completion but in any event after the
          Accounts Date.

6    No Withholdings or Deductions
     -----------------------------

6.1  Save only as may be required by law all sums payable by the Sellers to the
     Purchaser under this Deed shall be paid free and clear of all deductions or
     withholdings whatsoever.

6.2  If any deductions or withholdings are required by law to be made from any
     payment under this Deed, the Sellers shall pay to the Purchaser such sum as
     will, after the deduction or withholding has been made, leave the Purchaser
     with the same amount as it would have been entitled to receive in the
     absence of any such requirement to make a deduction or withholding.

7    Tax on Payments
     ---------------

7.1  Subject to clause 21.4, if any sum payable by the Sellers to the Purchaser
     under this Deed (including without limitation any sum payable under this
     clause 7) is (or but for the availability of any Relief would be) subject
     to an Actual Tax Liability in the hands of the Purchaser, the Sellers shall
     pay to the Purchaser such sum as would have been required to be paid under
     clause 6.2 had that Actual Tax Liability been a deduction or withholding
     from the sum payable by the Sellers.

8    Date for Payment
     ----------------

8.1  Where the Sellers become liable to make a payment pursuant to the
     provisions of this Deed, the due date for the making of that payment in
     cleared funds shall be the date falling five business days after the date
     on which the Purchaser or the relevant Group member has notified the
     Sellers of the amount of the payment required to be made or, if later:

     (a)  in the case of an Actual Tax Liability, on or before the second
          business day prior to the last date on which the payment of Tax in
          question may be paid to the relevant Tax Authority in order to avoid
          incurring a liability to interest or a charge fine or penalty in
          respect of that Actual Tax Liability; or

                                       6

<PAGE>

     (b)  in the case of the loss or set off of a right to repayment of Tax
          within paragraphs 1, 2 or 4 of schedule 3, the date on which the
          repayment would have been received but for such loss or set off;

     (c)  in the case of the set off of a Relief (other than a right to
          repayment of Tax) within paragraphs 2 to 5 inclusive of schedule 3,
          the last date on which, but for the set off, the Actual Tax Liability
          which would have been payable could have been paid to the relevant Tax
          Authority in order to avoid incurring a liability to interest or a
          charge fine or penalty in respect of that Actual Tax Liability;

     (d)  in the case of any liability within clause 2.1(c), the second business
          day prior to the date on which the payment or repayment becomes due
          and payable.

8.2  The Sellers may at their own expense require the amount of any payment
     required to be made under this Deed to be certified by the auditors for the
     time being of the relevant member of the Group (acting as experts and not
     as arbitrators) and the amount so certified shall (save for manifest error)
     be conclusive and binding on the parties.

9    Interest on Late Payments
     -------------------------

9.1  If any payment required to be made by the Sellers under this Deed is not
     made by the due date for payment thereof, then that payment shall carry
     interest from that due date until the date when the payment is actually
     made at the rate of two per cent. above the base rate from time to time of
     Lloyds TSB Bank Plc compounded quarterly.

10   Price Reduction
     ---------------

10.1 Any payment made by the Sellers under this Deed shall (so far as possible)
     be treated as a reduction in the consideration paid for the Sale Shares
     provided that nothing in this clause 10 shall limit or exclude the
     liability of the Sellers under this Deed.

11   Procedure for Tax Claims
     ------------------------

11.1 If the Purchaser shall become aware of any Tax Claim which is likely to
     give rise to a liability of the Sellers under this Deed the Purchaser shall
     as soon as reasonably practicable and in any event, in the case where the
     Tax Claim consists of an assessment or demand for which the period for
     response or appeal is time limited within ten Business Days prior to the
     expiry of such time limit give notice thereof to the Sellers but so that
     such notice shall not be a condition precedent to the liability of the
     Sellers hereunder.

11.2 If the Sellers shall indemnify the relevant Group member and the Purchaser
     to the Purchaser's reasonable satisfaction against all losses costs damages
     and expenses (including interest on overdue Tax) which may be incurred
     thereby the Purchaser shall (and shall procure that the relevant Group
     member shall) in accordance with any reasonable instructions of the Sellers
     promptly given by notice to the Purchaser and that Group member (but
     subject to clause 11.2(a) to 11.2(c) inclusive) seek to avoid dispute
     resist appeal compromise or defend such Tax Claim provided always that:

     (a)  no Group member shall be obliged to appeal against any assessment for
          Tax

          raised on it if, having given the Sellers notice of the receipt of
          that assessment, it has not within fifteen days thereafter received
          instructions from the Sellers, in accordance with the preceding
          provisions of this clause 11.2, to make that appeal;

     (b)  the Purchaser and that Group member shall not be obliged to comply
          with any instruction of the Sellers which involves contesting any
          assessment for Tax before any court or other appellate body (excluding
          the Tax Authority in question) unless the Sellers furnish the
          Purchaser with the written opinion of tax counsel of at least six
          years' call to the effect that an appeal against the assessment for
          Tax in question will, on the balance of probabilities, be won;

     (c)  the Purchaser and that Group member shall not in any event be obliged
          to comply with any instruction of the Sellers to make a settlement or
          compromise of the Tax Claim which is the subject of the dispute or
          agree any matter in the conduct of such dispute which is likely
          materially to increase the amount thereof or to increase the future
          liability of any Group member or of the Purchaser in respect of Tax.

11.3 If any of the Sellers or, before Completion, a Group member shall have
     committed acts or omissions which constitute fraud or negligent conduct
     clause 11.2 shall not apply.

12   Overprovision
     -------------

12.1 If before the sixth anniversary of Completion the auditors for the time
     being of the Group certify (at the request and expense of the Sellers)
     that:

     (a)  any provision for Tax in the Accounts (excluding any provision for
          deferred tax) has proved to be an overprovision; or

     (b)  the amount by which any right to repayment of Tax which has been
          treated as an asset in the Accounts proves to have been understated;

     then the amount of such overprovision or understatement ("Relevant Amount")
     shall be dealt with in accordance with paragraph 12.2 below provided that
     no account shall be taken of any overprovision or understatement to the
     extent that it arises as a consequence of the utilisation of any Accounts
     Relief or any action taken by the Group after Completion or any change in
     law or practice after Completion.

12.2 Where it is certified under paragraph 12.1 of this Part that a Relevant
     Amount has arisen such Relevant Amount is to be dealt with in accordance
     with this paragraph 12.2:

     (a)  the Relevant Amount shall first be set off against any payment due
          from the Sellers under this Deed or the Agreement;

     (b)  to the extent that there is an excess, a refund shall be made to the
          Sellers of any previous payment or payments made by the Sellers under
          this Deed or the Agreement and not previously refunded under this
          clause up to the amount of

                                       8

<PAGE>

          such excess; and

     (c)  to the extent that the excess referred to in paragraph 12.2(b) above
          is not exhausted under that clause, the remainder of that excess shall
          be carried forward and set off against any future payment or payments
          which become due from the Sellers under this Deed or the Agreement.

12.3 Where any such certification as is mentioned in paragraph 12.1 above has
     been made, the Sellers or the Purchaser or the Group may request that the
     auditors for the time being of the Group review (at the expense of the
     party so requesting) such certification in the light of all relevant
     circumstances, including any facts which have become known only since such
     certification, and to certify whether such certification remains correct or
     whether in the light of those circumstances the amount which was the
     subject of such certification should be amended.

12.4 If the auditors certify under paragraph 12.3 above that an amount
     previously certified should be amended, that amended amount shall be
     substituted for the purposes of paragraph 12.2 above as the Relevant Amount
     in respect of the certification in question in place of the amount
     originally certified, and such adjusting payment (if any) as may be
     required by virtue of the above-mentioned substitution shall be made as
     soon as practicable by the Sellers or (as the case may be) to the Sellers

13   THIRD PARTY RECOVERY
     --------------------

13.1 This clause 13 applies where if, before the sixth anniversary of
     Completion, any payment becomes due from the Sellers under this Deed or the
     Agreement and the Group either is immediately or subsequently becomes
     entitled to recover from any person (not being a member of the Group or an
     employee of the Group but including any Tax Authority) any sum in respect
     of the Tax Liability.

13.2 Where clause 13.1 applies, the Purchaser shall procure that the Group
     promptly notifies the Sellers of its entitlement and, if so required by the
     Sellers and subject to the Purchaser and the Group being indemnified by the
     Sellers to their reasonable satisfaction against any liabilities, costs or
     expenses (including additional Tax) which may thereby be incurred, takes
     all steps to enforce that recovery (keeping the Sellers fully informed of
     the progress of any action taken).

13.3 If the Sellers have made a payment under Deed or the Agreement in respect
     of the Tax Liability in question, the Purchaser shall account to the
     Sellers for whichever is the lesser of:

     (a)  any sum so recovered by the Group in respect of that Tax Liability
          (including any interest or repayment supplement paid by the Tax
          Authority or other person on or in respect thereof) less any Tax
          chargeable on the Group in respect of that interest and all
          liabilities and costs and expenses referred to in paragraph 13.2 above
          incurred by the Group and/or the Purchaser in obtaining recovery of
          such sum insofar as not previously made good to the Group or the
          Purchaser (as appropriate) by the Sellers; and

     (b)  the amount paid by the Sellers under this Deed or the Agreement in
          respect of

                                       9

<PAGE>

          that Tax. Liability.

14   Purchaser's covenant
     --------------------

14.1 The Purchaser hereby covenants with the Sellers to pay the Sellers an
     amount equal to any Tax for which the Sellers are or may be liable as a
     result of the application of section 767A or section 767AA Taxes Act
     (change in company ownership: corporation tax) where the taxpayer company
     or the transferred company (as defined in section 767A(1)(a) and section
     767AA(1)(a) respectively) is the Group together with any reasonable costs
     and expenses reasonably and properly incurred by the Sellers in connection
     with taking any successful action under this clause but only in
     circumstances where the Tax is directly or primarily chargeable against or
     attributable to the Group and arises:

     (a)  in respect of income profits or gains earned, accrued or received in
          respect of any period after Completion; or

     (b)  as a result of the failure of the Purchaser or the Group to apply an
          amount provided for in the Accounts or an amount paid by the Sellers
          to the Purchaser under this Deed to discharge a liability to which the
          amount relates.

14.2 A payment to be made by the Purchaser under this Deed shall be made in
     cleared funds seven days after written demand for such payment.

     Where the Purchaser fails to make a payment in satisfaction of a liability
     under this Deed by the due date for payment, the liability of the Purchaser
     shall be increased to include interest on such sum from the date on which
     the Purchaser becomes liable to make payment to the date of actual payment
     at a rate per annum being two per cent above the base rate from time to
     time of Lloyds TSB Bank Plc compounded quarterly
