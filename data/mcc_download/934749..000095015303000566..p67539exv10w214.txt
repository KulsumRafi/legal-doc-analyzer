and of the other covenants and agreements herein contained, hereby agrees, for
himself, heirs, administrators, successors and assigns as follows:

(Somerton -- 32nd Street)

and furnish at his own cost and expense all necessary machinery, tools,
apparatus, materials and labor to complete the work in the most substantial and
workmanlike manner according to the Plans and Specifications therefor on file
with the State Engineer and such modifications of the same and other directions
that may be made by the State Engineer as provided herein.

     ARTICLE II -- CONTRACT DOCUMENTS: It is further agreed that the Proposal,
Plans, Standard Specifications, Special Provisions, Contract Bond(s) and any and
all Supplementary Agreements, and any and all requirements necessary to complete
the work in a substantial and acceptable manner, and any and all equipment and
progress statements required, are hereby referred to and made a part of this
contract, and shall have the same force and effect as though all of the same
were fully inserted herein.

     ARTICLE III -- WARRANTY: The Contractor expressly warrants that he is free
from obligation of any other person or persons for services rendered, or
supposed to have rendered, in the procurement of this contract. He further
agrees that any breach of the Warranty shall constitute adequate cause for the
annulment of the Contract by the State of Arizona and that the State of Arizona
may retain to its own use from any sums of money due or become due thereunder,
an amount thereof equal to any brokerage, commission, or percentage so paid, or
agreed to be paid.

     ARTICLE IV -- TIME OF COMPLETION: The Contractor further covenants and
agrees that all of the said materials shall be furnished and delivered and all
of the said labor shall be done and performed in every respect to the
satisfaction and approval of the State Engineer and that the said work shall be
turned over to the State Engineer, complete and ready for use, on or before the
specified time herein. The work shall be free and discharged of all claims and
demands whatsoever for, or on account of any and all labor and materials used or
furnished to be used in said work.

     It is expressly understood and agreed that in case of failure on the part
of the Contractor, for any reason, except with the written consent of the State
Engineer, to complete the entire work to the satisfaction of the State Engineer,
and within the aforesaid time limit, the party of the first part shall deduct
from any money due, or which may become due the Contractor, as liquidated
damages, an amount in accordance with Subsection 108.09 of the Contract
Specifications.

     If no money shall be due the Contractor, the State shall have a cause of
action to recover against the Contractor in a court of competent jurisdiction,
liquidated damages, in accordance with Subsection 108.09 of the Contract
Specifications, said deduction to be made, or said sum to be recovered, not as a
penalty, but as liquidated damages; provided, however, that upon receipt of
written notice from the Contractor, of the existence of causes, as herein
provided, over which said Contractor has no control and which must delay the
completion of said work or any delay occasioned by the Arizona Department of
Transportation, the State Engineer may extend the period hereinbefore specified
for the completion of said work in accordance with the Specifications and in
such case, the Contractor shall become liable for said liquidated damages for
delays commencing from date said extension period shall expire.

     After the date as set up in Contract plus any extension granted, no further
payments shall be made the Contractor until all work is completed and accepted
by the State engineer. It is also agreed that the date of completion shall be
that upon which the work is accepted by the State Engineer.

     ARTICLE V -- CLAIMS FOR EXTRA WORK: It is distinctly understood and agreed
that no claim for extra work or materials, not specifically herein provided,
done or furnished by the Contractor, will be allowed by the State Engineer, nor
shall the Contractor do any work or furnish any materials not covered by these
Specifications and Contract, unless such work is ordered in writing by the State
Engineer. In no event shall the Contractor incur any liability by reason of any
oral direction or instruction that he may be given by the State Engineer, or his
authorized representatives. It is the intent and meaning of this Article that
all orders, directions, instructions, not contained in the Plans,
Specifications, and Special Provisions, pertaining to the work shall be in
writing, and the Contractor hereby waives any claims for compensation for work
done, or materials furnished in violation thereof.

     ARTICLE VI -- MISUNDERSTANDING OR DECEPTION: The party of the second party
agrees that he has investigated the site of the work and all parts and
appurtenances thereto and hereby waives any right to plead misunderstanding or
deception as to location, character of work or materials, estimates of
quantities or other conditions surrounding or being a part of the work and
understands that the quantities or other conditions surrounding or being a part
of the work and understands that the quantities given in the Bidding Schedule
are approximate only, and hereby agrees to accept the quantities as actually
placed and finally determined upon the completion of the work, in accordance
with the Contract Documents.

     ARTICLE VII -- PAYMENTS: For and in consideration of the faithful
performance of the work herein embraced, as set forth in the Contract Agreement,
Specifications, Special Provisions, Bidding Schedule and all general and
detailed Specifications and Plans, which are a part hereof, and in accordance
with the directions of the State Engineer and to his satisfaction or his

budgeted, therefore, and no right of action or damages shall accrue to the
benefit of the parties hereto as to that portion of the contract that may so
become null and void.
