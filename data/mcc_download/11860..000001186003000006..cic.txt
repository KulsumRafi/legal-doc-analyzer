                                                      March __, 2002

(Name)

Dear _____:

                                   Agreement

Bethlehem Steel Corporation (the "Company") considers it essential to the best
interest of its stockholders to have the continuous employment of key
management personnel.  In this connection, the Board of Directors of the
Company (the "Board") recognizes that, as is the case with many publicly held
corporations, the possibility of a Change in Control or a potential Change in
Control may exist and that such possibility, and the uncertainty and questions
which it may raise among management, may result in departure or distraction of
management personnel to the detriment of the Company, its stockholders and
security holders.

The Board has determined that appropriate steps should be taken to reinforce
and encourage the continued attention and dedication of certain members of the
Company"s management, including yourself, to their assigned duties without
distraction in the face of potentially disturbing circumstances arising from
the possibility of a Change of Control or a Potential Change of Control of the
Company.

In order to induce you to remain in the employ of the Company in certain
circumstances as set forth in Section 7 hereof, the Company agrees that you
shall receive the benefits set forth in this letter agreement in the event your
employment with the Company is terminated subsequent to a "Change in Control"
or "Potential Change in Control" (as defined in Sections 2 and 7 hereof) under
the circumstances below.

    1.  Term of Agreement.  This Agreement shall commence on the date hereof
        -----------------
and shall continue in effect through December 31, 2002; provided, however, that
commencing on January 1, 2003 and each January 1 thereafter, the term of this
Agreement shall automatically be extended for one additional year unless not
later than September 30 of the preceding year, the Company shall have given
notice that it does not wish to extend this Agreement, and provided, further,
that notwithstanding any such notice by the Company not to extend, this
agreement shall continue in effect for a period



<PAGE>

of twenty-four (24) months beyond the term provided herein if a Change in
Control shall have occurred during such term.


         (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary stated herein, this
Agreement shall terminate prior to the dates set forth above without further
acts by either party upon termination of your employment prior to a Change in
Control or Potential Change in Control due to death or Retirement (as defined
in Section 3(a)(ii) hereof), termination of your employment by the Company for
Cause or for Disability (as respectively defined in Sections 3(a)(iii) and
3(a)(i) hereof), termination of your employment by the Company prior to a
Change in Control or Potential Change in Control for other than Cause or
Disability, termination of your employment by you for any reason prior to a
Change in Control or Potential Change in Control, or completion by the Company
of all of its obligations in the event benefits shall become payable hereunder.

    2.  Change in Control.  No benefits shall be payable hereunder unless there

the Company shall thereafter have been terminated in accordance with Section 3
below.

              (iii) individuals who, as of the date hereof, constitute the

to constitute a majority thereof; provided, however, that any individual
becoming a director whose election, or nomination for election by the Company's
stockholders, was approved by a vote of at least 70% of the directors then
comprising the Incumbent Board shall be considered as though such individual
was a member of the Incumbent Board, but excluding, for this purpose, any
individual whose initial assumption of office occurs as a result of an actual
or threatened solicitation of proxies or consents by or on behalf of a Person
other than the Board of Directors of the Company;

              (iv) there is consummated a merger or consolidation of the
Company (or any direct or indirect subsidiary of the Company) with any other

which would result in the voting securities of the Company outstanding
immediately prior to such merger or consolidation continuing to represent
(either by remaining outstanding or by being converted into voting securities
of the surviving entity or any parent thereof) at least 75% of the combined
voting power of the stock and securities of the Company or such surviving
entity or any parent thereof outstanding immediately after such merger or
consolidation, or a merger or consolidation effected to implement a
recapitalization of the Company (or similar transaction) in which no Person is

voting power which is owned by Persons in substantially the same proportions as
their ownership of the Company's voting stock immediately prior to such sale.

         (b) For purposes of this Agreement, a "Change in Control" shall not be
deemed to have occurred if there is an acquisition of shares of the Company
common stock or securities convertible into shares of common stock by a
creditor of the Company on the Petition Date or otherwise pursuant to the Plan
of Reorganization; provided, however, that neither the creditor nor its
affiliates is engaged in the steel industry.

the foregoing, you shall not be deemed to have been terminated for Cause unless
and until there shall have been delivered to you a copy of a resolution duly
adopted by the affirmative vote of not less than three quarters of the entire

such payments cannot be finally determined on or before such day, the Company
shall pay to you on such day an estimate, as determined in good faith by the
Company, of the remainder of such payments (together with interest at the rate

amended (the "Code")) as soon as the amount thereof can be determined to have
been due, payable in no event later than the thirtieth (30th) day after the
Date of Termination.  In the event that the amount of the estimated payments
exceeds the amount subsequently determined to have been due, such excess shall

         (e) Insurance Benefits.  Subject to Section 3 hereof, if your
             ------------------
employment shall be terminated in a Qualifying Termination, then for the
thirty-six (36) months following such termination the Company shall maintain,
in full force and effect for your continued benefit, all life, and accident
insurance or comprehensive medical plan coverage or arrangements in which you
shall have been participating immediately prior to the Date of Termination,
provided your continued participation (or to the extent that a particular type
of coverage) shall be possible under the general terms and provisions of any
such plans and arrangements, on the same cost-sharing basis that applied to you
immediately prior to your Date of Termination.  In the event your participation
(or a particular type of coverage) under any such plan or arrangement shall be
barred, the Company shall arrange to provide you with benefits, at
substantially the same after-tax cost to you, which shall be substantially
similar to those which you shall be entitled to receive under such plans and
arrangements.  This Section 4(e) shall only be applicable to the extent that
you are not otherwise eligible for the benefits described as a result of your
Retirement.  Benefits otherwise receivable by you pursuant to this Section 4(e)
shall be reduced to the extent comparable benefits are actually received by or
made available to you without cost during the thirty-six (36) month period
following your termination of

                                       9

the Company's Pension Plan, Excess Benefit Plan, or Supplements Benefits Plan,
life insurance, post-retirement benefits, comprehensive medical plan coverage,
and such other benefits as may be applicable to you.

         (g) Mitigation.  You shall not be required to mitigate the amount of
             ----------
any payment provided for in Sections 4(c), (d) and (e) by seeking other
employment or otherwise, nor shall the amount of any payment or benefit
provided for in this Section 4 be reduced by any compensation earned by you as
a result of employment by another employer after the Date of Termination, or
otherwise.  Benefits otherwise receivable by you pursuant to Section 4(e) shall
be reduced to the extent comparable benefits shall be actually received by you
during the period benefits under Section 4(e) shall be applicable, and any such
benefits actually received by you shall be reported to the Company.

    5.  Excise Taxes.  The following provisions shall apply with respect to any
        ------------
excise tax imposed under Section 4999 of the Code (the "Excise Tax"):

employment (whether pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or any other plan,
arrangement or agreement with the Company, any person whose actions result in a
Change in Control of the Company or any person affiliated with the Company or
such person (the "Total Payments")) will be subject to Excise Tax, the Company
shall pay to you an additional amount (the "Gross- Up Payment") equal to the
amount of the Excise Tax which applies to the Total Payments, but excluding any
additional Excise Tax which may apply to the Gross-Up Payment or any income or
other taxes which may result from the Total Payments or the Gross-Up Payment.
Such payment shall be made in the manner described in Section 4(d) hereof.

         (b) For purposes of determining whether any of the Total Payments will
be subject to Excise Tax and the amount of such Excise Tax, (i) any Total
Payments shall be treated as "parachute payments" (within the meaning of
Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code) unless, in the opinion of tax counsel selected
by the Company's independent auditors and reasonably acceptable to you, such
payments or benefits (in whole or in part) do not constitute parachute
payments, including by reason of Section 280G(b)(4)(A) of the Code, and all
"excess parachute payments" (within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(1) of the
Code) shall be treated as subject to the Excise Tax unless, in the opinion of
such tax counsel, such excess parachute payments (in whole or in part)
represent reasonable compensation for services actually rendered (within the
meaning of Section 280G(b)(4)(B) of the Code), or are otherwise not subject to
the Excise Tax, and

                                      10


<PAGE>

(ii) the value of any noncash benefits or any deferred payment or benefit shall
be determined by the Company's independent auditors in accordance with the
principles of Section 280G(d)(3) of the Code.  For purposes of determining the
amount of the Gross- Up Payment, you shall be deemed to pay federal income and
employment taxes at the highest marginal rate of federal income and employment
taxation in the calendar year in which the Gross-Up Payment is to be made and
state and local income and employment taxes at the highest marginal rate of
taxation in the state and locality of your residence on the Date of Termination
(or such other time as hereinafter described), net of the maximum reduction in
federal income or employment taxes which could be obtained from deduction of
such state and local taxes.

         (c) In the event that the Excise Tax is subsequently determined to be
less than the amount taken into account hereunder at the time of termination of
your employment (or such other time as is hereinafter described), you shall
repay to the Company, at the time that the amount of such reduction in Excise
Tax is finally determined, the portion of the Gross-Up Payment attributable to
such reduction plus interest on the amount of such repayment at the rate
provided in Section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code.  In the event that the Excise
Tax is determined to exceed the amount taken into account hereunder at the time
of the termination of your employment (or such other time as is hereinafter
described) (including by reason of any payment the existence or amount of which
cannot be determined at the time of the Gross-Up Payment), the Company shall
make an additional Gross-Up Payment in respect of such excess (plus any
interest, penalties or additions payable by you with respect to such excess) at
the time that the amount of such excess is finally determined.  You and the
Company shall each reasonably cooperate with the other in connection with any
administrative or judicial proceedings concerning the existence or amount of
liability for Excise Tax with respect to the Total Payments.

    6.  Letter of Credit Preceding Termination/Grantor Trust.  In the event a
        ----------------------------------------------------
Potential Change in Control (as hereinafter defined) shall have occurred after
the Effective Date of the Company's Plan of Reorganization under the Bankruptcy
Code, the Company shall promptly (and in no event more than fourteen (14) days
thereafter) take one of the following actions:

         (a) Letter of Credit.  The Company may establish an irrevocable letter
             ----------------
of credit (the "Letter of Credit") in your favor in an amount equal to the
aggregate amounts which would be payable to you pursuant to Section 4 hereof as
if you were immediately entitled to payment pursuant thereto, plus $100,000.
Such Letter of Credit to be issued by a commercial bank which shall be a
national banking association or established under the laws of one of the state
of the United States, and which shall have equity in excess of $100 million
(the "Bank").

              (i) Payments under Letter of Credit.  The Letter of Credit shall
                  -------------------------------
be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to you and the Company and
shall provide that the Bank shall pay you the amount of your draft, on
presentation to the Bank of a statement, signed by you or your authorized
representative, setting forth a

                                      11


<PAGE>

statement, in the form attached as Exhibit A hereto, that pursuant to any or
all of Section 4 of this Agreement, you are entitled to payments of not less
than the amount of such draft and have not otherwise received such payments
(the "Statement"), and the Date of Termination of your employment and by the
independent agent selected by the Company immediately upon the occurrence of a
Potential Change in Control and reasonably acceptable to you (the "Agent"),
setting forth a statement that it has reviewed the calculation of the benefits
to which you claim you are entitled and that it has confirmed the accuracy of
such calculations.  With respect to the statement prepared by the Agent
pursuant to clause (ii) of the preceding sentence, the Agent shall have no duty
to inquire of the Company, or otherwise determine, whether you are entitled to
the payments which you claim, but shall merely confirm that, assuming you are
so entitled to such benefits, the calculation thereof has been accurately
performed.

              (ii) Maintenance of Letter of Credit.  Each time you shall draw
                   -------------------------------
on the Letter of Credit, you shall provide the Company with a copy of such
draft and the accompanying statement referred to above.  The Company shall
maintain the Letter of Credit in effect for a period of two (2) years from the
date on which it shall be issued; provided, however, that if during any two (2)
month period any event shall occur which, pursuant to this Section 6, would
have required the Company to establish a Letter of Credit had none then
existed, then the Company shall maintain the Letter of Credit in effect for a
period of two (2) years following such event unless further extended pursuant
to this Section.  During the period in which a Letter of Credit is required to
be maintained, the Company shall, at six-month intervals commencing with the
date the Letter of Credit shall be established, calculate the amount which
would be payable to you pursuant to Section 4 hereof as if you were immediately
entitled to payment pursuant thereto.  If the amount so calculated, plus
$100,000, shall exceed the amount available to be drawn upon under the Letter
of Credit then in effect, the Company shall promptly (and in no event later
than seven (7) days thereafter) cause the amount payable under the Letter of
Credit to be increased by the amount of such excess.

         (b) Grantor Trust.  In lieu of obtaining a Letter of Credit, the
             -------------
Company, in its discretion, may establish a grantor trust (the "Grantor
Trust"), which shall become irrevocable upon a Change in Control, for your
benefit with a Bank and shall fund such grantor Trust with the amount otherwise
to be covered by the Letter of Credit as described in the first sentence of
paragraph 6(a).  You shall be entitled to payments from the Grantor Trust upon
your presentation to the Bank of the Statement.

         (c) Effect of Payments under Letter of Credit or Grantor Trust.  The
             ----------------------------------------------------------
Payment by the Bank of the amount of your draft in accordance with the terms
hereof and of the Letter of Credit or from the Grantor Trust, whichever is
applicable, shall reduce any obligation of the Company to you pursuant to this
Agreement by such amount and shall not constitute a waiver by the Company of,
or in any way preclude the Company from asserting, any claim against you that
you shall not be entitled to some or all of such payment.  In addition, your
drawing upon the Letter of Credit shall not constitute a waiver by you, or in
any way preclude you from asserting, any claim against the

                                      12


<PAGE>

Company that you are entitled to amounts pursuant to this Agreement which were
not paid by amounts received under the Letter of Credit or Grantor Trust.

7.  Potential Change in Control.  (a) For purposes of this Agreement, a
    ---------------------------
"Potential Change in Control" shall be deemed to have occurred if:

              (i) the Company shall enter into an agreement, the consummation
of which would result in the occurrence of a Change in Control;

              (ii) any person other than the Company shall publicly announce an
intention to take or to consider taking actions which if consummated would
constitute a Change in Control;

              (iii) an person other than the Company or a subsidiary Company or
any employee benefit plan sponsored by the Company or any subsidiary of the
Company shall become the beneficial owner (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3
under the Exchange Act) of securities of the Company representing 10% or more
of the combined voting power of the Company's then outstanding securities
ordinarily (and apart from rights accruing under special circumstances) having
the right to vote in the election of directors as a result of a tender or
exchange offer, open market purchase, privately negotiated purchases or
otherwise, unless more than 50% of those directors of the Company who shall be
non-officer directors shall prior to, or immediately after reaching such 10%
beneficial ownership level, vote in favor of a resolution of the Board of
Directors determining, or join in a written declaration to that effect, that
such beneficial ownership will not constitute a Potential Change in Control; or

              (iv) more than 50% of those directors of the Company who shall be
non-officer directors shall vote in favor of a resolution, or join in a written
declaration, to the effect that a Potential Change in Control for the purposes
of this Agreement shall have occurred.

         (b) You agree that, subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, in the event of a Potential Change in Control, you will at the
option of the Company remain in the employ of the Company for a period of six
(6) months from the occurrence of the first such Potential Change in Control.

    8.  Successors; Binding Agreement.  The Company shall require any successor
        -----------------------------
(whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise)
to all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company, by
agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to you, to expressly
assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same
extent that the Company would be required to perform it if no such succession
had taken place.  Failure of the Company to obtain such assumption and
agreement prior to the effectiveness of any such succession shall be a breach
of this Agreement and shall entitle you to all compensation from the Company in
the same amount and on the same terms as you would be entitled hereunder if you
had terminated your employment for Good Reason, except that for

                                      13


<PAGE>



purposes of implementing the foregoing, the date on which any such succession
becomes effective shall be the Date of Termination.  As used in this Agreement,
Company shall mean the Company as defined herein and any successor to its
business and/or assets which executes and delivers the agreement provided for
in this Section 8 or which otherwise becomes bound by all the terms and
provisions of this Agreement by operation of law.

         (b) This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by
your personal or legal representatives, executors, administrators, successors,
heirs, distributees, devisees, and legatees.  If you should die while any
amount would still be payable to you hereunder if you had continued to live,
all such amounts, unless otherwise provided herein, shall be paid in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement to your devisee, legatee or other designee, or
if there shall be no such designee, to your estate.

    9.  Notice.  For the purposes of this Agreement, notices and all other
        ------
communications provided for in the Agreement shall be in writing and shall be
deemed to have been duly given when delivered or mailed by United States

effective only upon receipt.

         -------------
or discharged unless such modification, waiver or discharge is agreed to in
writing and signed by you and such officer as may be specifically designated by
the Board.  No waver by either party hereto at any time of any breach by the
other party hereto of, or compliance with, any condition or provision of this
Agreement to be performed by such other party shall be deemed a waiver of
similar or dissimilar provisions or conditions at the same or any prior or
subsequent time.  No agreements or representations, oral or otherwise, express
or implied, with respect to the subject matter hereof have been made by either
party which are not expressly set forth in this Agreement.  The validity,

governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (without regard to

         -----------

Agreement.  No such arbitration proceedings shall be commenced or conducted
until at least 60 days after the parties hereby agree to endeavor in good faith
to resolve any dispute by mutual agreement.  If mutual agreement cannot be
attained, any disputing party, by written notice to the other ("Arbitration
Notice") may commence arbitration proceedings.  Such arbitration proceedings

Pennsylvania court of competent jurisdiction shall appoint any arbitrator that

and attorneys fees and may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.

    15.  No Guaranty of Employment.  Neither this contract nor any action taken
         -------------------------
hereunder shall be construed as giving you a right to be retained as an
employee of the Company.  The Company shall be entitled to terminate your
employment at any time, subject to providing the severance benefits herein
