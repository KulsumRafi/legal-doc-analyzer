the limitations described in Article 9, the Participating Employer of an

each calendar quarter that exceeds three percent of the Active Participant's
Eligible Earnings for such calendar quarter and that does not exceed five
percent of the Active Participant's Eligible Earnings for such calendar quarter.</p>

  </blockquote>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify">It is intended that such Matching
Contributions will be used by the Participating Employer to satisfy the safe
harbor provisions of Code sections 401(k)(12) and 401(m)(11).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To be eligible to share in the
Participating Employer's Matching Contribution for a given calendar quarter, a
Participant must have, on or before the last day of the calendar quarter,
entered the Plan as a Participant for the purposes of having Matching
Contributions made on his or her behalf, received Eligible Earnings for the
calendar quarter from the Participating Employer and made 401(k) Contributions.</p>

Contributions for a calendar quarter that are used to satisfy the safe harbor
provisions of Code sections 401(k)(12) and 401(m)(11) will be paid to the

with respect to any portion of a Participant's 401(k) Contributions returned to
the Participant pursuant to Article&nbsp;9.&nbsp;
For this purpose, 401(k) Contributions with respect to which no Matching
Contributions are made for a Plan Year will be deemed to be the first such
contributions returned to the Participant.&nbsp;
If the Administrator determines that Matching Contributions that have
been added to a Participant's Account should not have been added by reason of
this subsection, the contributions, increased by Fund earnings or decreased by
Fund losses attributable to the contributions, as determined under Section 9.5,
will be subtracted from the Account as soon as administratively practicable
after the determination is made and will be applied to satisfy the contribution
obligations of the Participating Employer that made the excess contributions
for the Plan Year for which the excess contributions were made.&nbsp; If, because of the passage of time, the
excess cannot be applied in this way, the excess will be allocated, in the
discretion of the Administrator:</p>

Employer is eligible for Matching Contributions only if and to the extent
provided in the collective bargaining agreement.</p>

Section 7.2 of the Plan is amended effective January 1, 2002,
to read as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify"><a name="_Toc529019743">&quot;7.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><i><u>Forfeiture
Upon Distribution</u></i></b>.</a></p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If a Participant receives a distribution
of the entire vested balance of his or her Accounts after Termination of
Employment and before he or she incurs five consecutive One-Year Breaks in
Service, the nonvested portions of the Participant's Profit Sharing
Contribution Account will, at the time of such distribution, be forfeited.&nbsp; A Participant who has no vested interest in
his or her Profit Sharing Contribution Account when he or she terminates
employment will be deemed to have received a distribution of the entire vested
balance of the Account at the time of his or her Termination of Employment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If a Participant described in Subsection
(a) received a distribution of less than the entire balance of his or her
Accounts, resumes employment as a Qualified Employee and repays to the Trustee
the full amount distributed, other than the portion of the distribution
attributable to his or her After-Tax Contribution Account, Rollover Account and
Profit Sharing Plan Rollover Account balances, before the earlier of (1) five
years following the date of reemployment as a Qualified Employee or (2) the
date on which he or she incurs five consecutive One-Year Breaks in Service
following the distribution, then, the amount of any forfeitures will be
restored to the Participant's Profit Sharing Contribution Account, unadjusted
for interest or any change in value occurring after the distribution.&nbsp; Such restoration will be made from
forfeitures that arise for the Plan Year for which such restoration is to be
made.&nbsp; To the extent such forfeitures
are insufficient for such purpose, the Participating Employer with whom the
Participant was last employed as a Qualified Employee will contribute the amount
required to restore the Account.&nbsp; A
Participant described in the last sentence of Subsection (a) who is reemployed
before incurring five consecutive One-Year Breaks in Service following the date
of his or her Termination of Employment will be deemed to have repaid his or
her deemed distribution upon his or her reemployment as a Qualified Employee.&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Except as provided in Section 7.2, the
nonvested portions of a Participant's Profit Sharing Contribution Account will
continue to be held in a separate subaccount of such Account until the
Participant incurs five consecutive One-Year Breaks in Service, at which time
the subaccount balance will be forfeited.&nbsp;
If the Participant resumes employment with an Affiliated Organization
prior to incurring five consecutive One-Year Breaks in Service, such subaccount
will be disregarded and its balance will be included in the Profit Sharing
Contribution Account.</p>

her Profit Sharing Contribution Account balance following a resumption of
employment in accordance with Subsection (a) at any given time will not be less
than the amount &quot;X&quot; determined by the formula: X = P(AB + (R x D)) -
(R x D), where P is the Participant's vested percentage at the time of
determination; AB is the Account balance at the time of determination; D is the
amount of the distribution; and R is the ratio of the Account balance at the
time of determination, to the subaccount balance immediately following the
distribution.&quot;</p>

of Company Stock and cash in lieu of any fractional share.&quot;</p>
