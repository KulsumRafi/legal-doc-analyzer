            Total Assets (other  than patents, patent rights, trademarks, trade
            names,  copyrights,  franchises,  licenses,  goodwill  and  similar

entirety and replaced with the following:

      "6.19 Yearly Audit/Appraisal. Operating Company shall cooperate with Bank
      in  a  yearly  audit of the Inventory  and/or  Accounts  Receivable  (the
      average annual cost  of  which  shall not exceed $3,000) and appraisal of
      the Fixed Assets, the cost of which shall be borne by Borrower."

      5.    This Amendment shall be conditioned  on  the  payment to Bank of an
Amendment fee in the amount of $7,000.00 concurrently herewithin.

      6.    Except  as  expressly  provided  in  this  Amendment,  the  parties
acknowledge that the Loan Agreement is in full force and  effect  and  Borrower
acknowledges  that  there  are  no  defenses  or  setoffs  to any of Borrower's
obligations under the Loan Agreement as of the date hereof.

      7.    Borrower certifies that no Event of Default (as defined in the Loan
Agreement) has occurred and is continuing.

      8.    Borrower  and  Guarantors represent and warrant that  each  of  its
authority  documents  (as identified  in  Section  4.2  and  4.3  of  the  Loan
Agreement) delivered to Bank in connection with the Loan Agreement, are in full
force and effect and have not been modified, repealed or amended since the date
thereof.

      9.    If any provision  of  this  Amendment  shall  be  held  invalid  or
unenforceable,  such  invalidity  or  unenforceability  shall  affect only such
provision and shall not in any manner affect or render invalid or unenforceable
any other provision of this Amendment, and this Amendment shall  be enforced as
if any such invalid or unenforceable provision were not contained herein.

      10.   Except  as  specifically  amended hereby, the Loan Agreement  shall
remain  unchanged  and  shall  be  in full force  and  effect,  enforceable  in
accordance with its terms.
