<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Change of Control</u>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;For purposes of the Agreement, a "change of
control" means, and shall be deemed to have taken place, if;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;any individual,
partnership, firm, corporation, association, trust, unincorporated organization or other entity or person, or any syndicate or

representing 50% or more of the combined voting power of the Company's then outstanding securities entitled to vote in the election
of directors of the Company;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;during any period

reason to constitute a majority of the Board;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;there occurs a
reorganization, merger, consolidation or other corporate transaction involving the Company (a "<u>Transaction</u>"), and
shareholders of the Company immediately prior to such Transaction do not, immediately after the Transaction, own more than 50% of
the combined voting power of the Company or other corporation resulting from such Transaction; or</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;there is a
"change in control" of the Company within the meaning of Section 280G of the U.S. Federal internal revenue code of 1986.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;For the purposes of this <u>Section
5(e)</u>, the term "Good Reason" shall mean the relocation of the Company's principal executive offices to a location which is more
than fifty (50) miles from its then-current location without the consent of Executive.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event Executive is terminated by
the Company for any reason (other than for Cause as defined in <u>Section 5(c)</u> thereof, but including a resignation for Good
Reason as defined in <u>Section 5(e)(ii)</u>), during the period three (3) months before or two (2) years following a "change in
control" of the Company (or any successor), Executive shall be entitled to receive a cash payment equal to eighteen (18) months of
Executive's current Base Salary and the benefits described in <u>Section 5(d)(iii)</u> of the Agreement.&nbsp; Upon such "change of
control" during the Term, the Term of this Agreement shall automatically be the period equal to the longer of (i) two (2) years
from the date of the "change of control" or (ii) the remaining period of the initial three (3) year Term after the "change of
control". &nbsp; In no event shall Executive be entitled to receive both the Severance Payment described in <u>Section 5(d)</u>
hereof and the "change of control" payment described in this <u>Section 5(e)</u>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;Any payments to be made to Executive in
connection with this <u>Section 5(e)</u> shall be made in a lump sum, subject to statutory deductions and withholdings, in cash
within ten (10) business days after the date of termination or any earlier time required by applicable law.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Tax Consideration</u>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event that the aggregate of all payments or
benefits made or provided to the Executive under this Agreement and under all other plans and programs of the Company (the
"<u>Aggregate Payment</u>") is determined to constitute a Parachute Payment, as such term is defined in Section 280G(b)(2) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), the Company shall pay to the Executive an additional amount (the
"<u>Gross-Up Amount</u>"), prior to the time any excise tax ("<u>Excise Tax</u>") is imposed by Section 4999 of the Code is payable
with respect to such Aggregate Payment, which, after the imposition of all excise, federal, state and local income taxes, enables
the Executive to retain a total amount equal to the Aggregate Payment prior to the payment of the Gross-Up Amount.&nbsp;
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if it shall be determined that the Executive is entitled to receive the Gross-Up Amount, but the
portion of the Aggregate Payment that would be treated as a Parachute Payment does not exceed 125% of the greatest amount that
could be paid to the Executive such that the receipt of the Aggregate Payment would not give rise to any Excise Tax (the "Safe
Harbor Amount"), then no Gross-Up Amount shall be paid to the Executive and the Aggregate Payment shall be reduced to the Safe
Harbor Amount.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;All determinations required to be made under this
<u>Section 5(f)</u>, including whether the Aggregate Payment constitutes a Parachute Payment, the amount of the Gross-Up Amount to
be paid to the Executive, if any, and the determination of the Safe Harbor Amount, if applicable, shall be made in good faith by
the by the Company's regular outside auditors (the "<u>Accounting Firm</u>"); <u>provided</u>, however, that such Accounting Firm
presents its rationale and supporting calculations to the Executive upon his request and shall in good faith work to resolve any
discrepancies raised by accountants or lawyers chosen by the Executive who present reasonable critiques of the determination.&nbsp;
If a dispute over the methodology or conclusions of the Accounting Firm cannot be resolved between the parties, an impartial
accounting firm shall be consulted to resolve the dispute.&nbsp; All fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm incurred in
connection with the retention of the Accounting Firm pursuant to this Section 5(f) shall be borne by the Company. All fees and
expenses of the accountants and lawyers chosen by the Executive and, if retained, the additional accounting firm, incurred in
connection with the resolution of any disputes pursuant to this Section 5(f) shall be borne by the non-prevailing party.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of uncertainty in the application of
Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code at the time of the determination by the Accounting Firm, the parties hereto acknowledge and
agree that it is possible that the Company will have paid a Gross-Up Amount that exceeds the amount that the Company should have
paid pursuant to this Section 5(f) (the "<u>Overpayment</u>") or that the Company will have paid a Gross-Up Amount that is less
than the amount that the Company should have paid pursuant to this Section 5(f) (the "<u>Underpayment</u>").&nbsp; In the event the
Accounting Firm, in a written opinion delivered to the Company and to the Executive, determines that, based upon the assertion of a
deficiency by the Internal Revenue Service against the Executive, which the Accounting Firm believes has a high probability of
success, an Overpayment has been made, then any such Overpayment shall, to the extent permitted under applicable law (including
Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002), be treated for all purposes as a loan to the Executive which the Executive shall
promptly repay to the Company together with interest at the Applicable Federal Rate provided for in Section 7872(f)(2) of the Code;
provided, however, the Executive may contest any such determination by the Accounting Firm at his own expense.&nbsp; In the event
the Accounting Firm, based upon controlling precedent or other substantial authority, determines that an Underpayment has occurred,
any such Underpayment shall be promptly paid by the Company to or for the benefit of the Executive together with interest at the
Applicable Federal Rate provided for in Section 7872(f)(2) of the Code.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g)&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Treatment of Stock Options Upon a Termination</u>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;If this Agreement is terminated pursuant
to clause <u>(e)</u> of this <u>Section 5</u>,&nbsp; all stock options or similar rights granted to Executive pursuant to the
Company's stock option plans shall immediately vest as of the date of termination and Executive may exercise any such vested stock
options for a period of 390 days following such termination, but in no event later than ten (10) years after grant.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;If this Agreement is terminated pursuant
to clause <u>(c)</u> of this <u>Section 5</u>, all stock options granted to Executive pursuant to the Company's stock plans shall
terminate immediately.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the extent that
the Executive has been granted stock options intended to be incentive stock options under Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code,
such stock options shall cease to be incentive stock options and shall be treated as nonqualified stock options if the options are
exercised by the Employee more than three (3) months (one year in case of death or disability as defined in Section 422 of the
Internal Revenue Code) following termination of employment.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except as expressly modified by
this clause <u>(g)</u> of this <u>Section 5</u>, all stock options and similar rights granted under the Company's stock plans shall
remain subject to all of the terms and conditions of the applicable stock plans and agreements evidencing the grants thereof.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(h)&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Status of Executive During Exclusivity Period</u>.&nbsp; If this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to clauses <u>(a), (b), or (d)</u> of this <u>Section 5</u>, during Executive's Exclusivity Period the
Executive shall be deemed and treated as an employee of the Company for the purposes of all payroll, benefits, welfare and stock
option plans.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Exclusive Remedy</u>.&nbsp; Executive agrees that the payments other benefits
provided and contemplated by this Agreement shall constitute the sole and exclusive obligation of the Company in respect of
Executive's employment with and relationship to the Company and that the full payment thereof shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy for any termination of Executive's employment.&nbsp; Executive covenants not to assert or pursue any other remedies, at law
or in equity, with respect to any termination of employment.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Business Expenses</u>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b> During the Term of this Agreement, to the extent that such
expenditures satisfy the criteria under the Internal Revenue Code or other applicable laws for deductibility by the Company
(whether or not fully deductible by the Company) for federal income tax purposes as ordinary and necessary business expenses, the
Company shall provide the Executive with reimbursement of reasonable business expenses incurred by the Executive while conducting
Company business in a manner consistent with the Company's policies and provisions applicable to the Executives of the Company.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;Executive acknowledges that in the event of his employment with the Company
terminates for any reason, Executive will be able to earn a livelihood without violating the foregoing restrictions.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;If any provision or clause, or portion thereof, within this <u>Section 8</u> shall
be held by any court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, invalid, or unenforceable in such jurisdiction, the
remainder of such provision shall not be thereby affected and shall be given full effect, without regard to the invalid
portion.&nbsp; It is the intention of the parties that, if any court construes any provision or clause within this <u>Section
8</u>, or any portion thereof, to be illegal, void or unenforceable because of the duration of such provision or the geographic
area or matter covered thereby, such court shall reduce the duration, area, or matter of such provision, and, in its reduced form,
such provision shall then be enforceable and shall be enforced.</p>

<p><b>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Intellectual Property</u></b>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;Executive has no interest (except as disclosed to the Company) in any inventions,
designs, improvements, patents, copyrights and discoveries which are useful in or directly or indirectly related to the business of
the Company or to any experimental work carried on by the Company.&nbsp; Except as may be limited by applicable law, all
inventions, designs, improvements, patents, copyrights and discoveries conceived by Executive during the Term of this Agreement
which are useful in or directly or indirectly related to the business of the Company or to any experimental work carried on by the
Company, shall be the property of the Company.&nbsp; Executive will promptly and fully disclose to the Company all such inventions,
designs, improvements, patents, copyrights and discoveries (whether developed individually or with other persons) and will take all
steps necessary and reasonably required to assure the Company's ownership thereof and to assist the Company in protecting or
defending the Company's proprietary rights therein.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;Executive also agrees to assist the Company in obtaining United States or foreign
letters patent and copyright registrations covering inventions assigned hereunder to the Company and that Executive's obligation to
assist the Company shall continue beyond the termination of Executive's employment but the Company shall compensate Executive at a
reasonable rate for time actually spent by Executive at the Company's request with respect to such assistance.&nbsp; If the Company
is unable because of Executive's mental or physical incapacity or for any other reason to secure Executive's signature to apply for
or to pursue any application for any United States or foreign letters patent or copyright registrations covering inventions
assigned to the Company, then Executive hereby irrevocably designates and appoints the Company, each of its duly authorized
officers and agents as Executive's agent and attorney-in-fact to act for and in Executive's behalf and stead to execute and file
any such applications and to do all other lawfully permitted acts to further the prosecution and issuance of letters patent or
copyright registrations thereon with the same legal force and effect as if executed by Executive.&nbsp; Executive will further
assist the Company in every way to enforce any copyrights or patents obtained including, without limitation, testifying in any suit
or proceeding involving any of the copyrights or patents or executing any documents deemed necessary by the Company, all without
further consideration but at the expense of the Company.&nbsp; If Executive is called upon to render such assistance after the
termination of Executive's employment, then Executive shall be entitled to a fair and reasonable per diem fee in addition to
reimbursement of any expenses incurred at the request of the Company.</p>

<p><b>10.&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Remedies.</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;</b> The parties hereto agree that the services to be rendered by Executive
pursuant to this Agreement, and the rights and privileges granted to the Company pursuant to this Agreement, are of a special,
unique, extraordinary and intellectual character, which gives them a peculiar value, the loss of which cannot be reasonably or
adequately compensated in damages in any action at law, and that a breach by Executive of any of the terms of this Agreement will
cause the Company great and irreparable injury and damage.&nbsp; Executive hereby expressly agrees that the Company shall be
entitled to the remedies of injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent a breach of this Agreement by
Executive.&nbsp; This <u>Section 10</u> shall not be construed as a waiver of any other rights or remedies which the Company may
have for damages or otherwise.</p>

<p><b>11.&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Return of Property</u></b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Executive agrees to return, on or before the termination date, all
property belonging to the Company, including but not limited to computers, PDA, telephone and other credit cards, Company business
records, Company automobile (if applicable), etc.</p>

<p><b>12.&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Severability</u></b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable for any
reason, it shall be adjusted rather than voided, if possible, to achieve the intent of the parties to the extent possible.&nbsp; In
any event, all other provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed valid and enforceable to the extent possible.</p>

<p><b>13.&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Succession</u></b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the Company
and its successors and assigns and any such successor or assignee shall be deemed substituted for the Company under the terms of
this Agreement for all purposes.&nbsp; As used herein, "successor" and "assignee" shall include any person, firm, corporation or
other business entity which at any time, whether by purchase, merger or otherwise, directly or indirectly acquires the stock of the
Company or to which the Company assigns this Agreement by operation of law or otherwise.&nbsp; The obligations and duties of
Executive hereunder are personal and otherwise not assignable.&nbsp; Executive's obligations and representations under this
Agreement will survive the termination of Executive's employment, regardless of the manner of such termination.</p>

writing and sent if to the Company to its principal office at:</p>

mail, once verification of receipt is received, or (iii)&nbsp;if given by any other means, when actually delivered to the addressee
at such address and verification of receipt is received.</p>

<p><b>15.&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Adequate Consideration</u></b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Executive acknowledges that the cash severance and other
benefits to be provided by the Company to Executive are not available under any current plan or policies of the Company.&nbsp;
Accordingly, Executive further acknowledges that the payments and benefits under this Agreement provide adequate consideration for
Executive's obligations to the Company contained in <u>Section 7</u> (Confidential Information), <u>Section 8</u>

<h3 align="center"><b><u>EXHIBIT A</u></b></h3>

<p align="center">RELEASE</p>

<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;I signed an Employment Agreement with Photronics, Inc. (the "Company"), dated February 20, 2003 (the "Agreement"),
wherein I agreed to the terms applicable to certain terminations of employment with the Company.&nbsp; Pursuant to the terms of the
Agreement, I am entitled to certain severance payments and benefits, described in the Agreement, provided that I sign this
Release.</p>

<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;In consideration of the severance payments described in the Agreement, I, on behalf of myself, my heirs, agents,
representatives, predecessors, successors and assigns, hereby irrevocably release, acquit and forever discharge the Company and
each of its respective agents, employees, representatives, parents, subsidiaries, divisions, affiliates, officers, directors,
shareholders, investors, employees, attorneys, transferors, transferees, predecessors, successors and assigns, jointly and
severally (the "<u>Released Parties</u>") of and from any and all debts, suits, claims, actions, causes of action, controversies,
demands, rights, damages, losses, expenses, costs, attorneys' fees, compensation, liabilities and obligations whatsoever, suspected
or unsuspected, known or unknown, foreseen or unforeseen, arising at any time up to and including the date of this Release, save
and except for the parties' obligations and rights under the Agreement.&nbsp; In recognition of the consideration set forth in the
Agreement, I hereby release and forever discharge the Released Parties from any and all claims, actions and causes of action, I
have or may have as of the date of this Release arising under any state or <b></b>federal civil rights or human rights law, or
under the Federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, as amended, and the applicable rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder ("ADEA").&nbsp; By signing this Release, I hereby acknowledge and confirm the following: (a) I was advised in writing by
the Company in connection with my termination to consult with an attorney of my choice prior to signing this Agreement, including
without limitation, the terms relating to my release of claims arising under ADEA and any other law, rule or regulation referred to
above; (b) I was given a period of not fewer than 21 days to consider the terms of this Agreement and to consult with an attorney
of my choosing with respect hereto; and (c) I am providing the release and discharge set forth in this paragraph only in exchange
for consideration in addition to anything of value to which I was already entitled.<b></b></p>

<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Agreement and this Release may be revoked by me within the 7-day period commencing on the date I sign this
Release (the "Revocation Period").&nbsp; In the event of any such revocation, all obligations of the Company under the Agreement
will terminate and be of no further force and effect as of the date of such revocation and both the Company and I will have and be
entitled to exercise all rights that would have existed had the Agreement and Release not been entered into.&nbsp; No such
revocation will be effective unless it is in writing and signed by me and received by the Company prior to the expiration of the
Revocation Period.</p>
