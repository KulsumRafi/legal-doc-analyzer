Secured Party that:

                  (a) Borrower owns the Collateral free and clear of all liens,
security interests, adverse claims and encumbrances other than (i) the security
interest created or permitted hereby, (ii) any security interest granted to any
lender, equity investor, ground lessor or other party having an interest in the
property owned by the Borrower and disclosed to secured party prior to the date
hereof;

                  (b) No financing statement covering any of the Collateral is
on file in any public office except with respect to any security interest
permitted under Paragraph 3(a) above;

                  (c) True and correct copies of the documents governing the
claim and other collateral more particularly described in EXHIBIT A attached
hereto have heretofore been submitted to Secured Party, and the same has not
been amended and are in full force and effect; and

                  (d) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement

lease, assign, abandon or otherwise dispose of any of the Collateral or any
interest therein.

                  (b) Borrower shall keep the Collateral free of liens, security

                  (f) Secured Party, at its option and after reasonable notice
to Borrower (provided that the giving of such notice shall not cause Secured
Party to incur late fees, penalties or other costs related to any discharge to
which this subsection (f) applies), may discharge taxes, liens, security
interests and other encumbrances against the Collateral if not paid when due.
Borrower shall reimburse Secured Party within ten (10) days following delivery

Party deems necessary) and perform such other acts as Secured Party may
reasonably request to perfect and maintain a valid security interest in the
Collateral, including, upon Secured Party's request, transferring to Secured
Party any Collateral in which a security interest may be perfected only by
taking possession thereof.

Settlement Agreement, dated as of February 14, 2002, as amended, to which each
of Borrower and Secured Party are parties.

         5. Events Of Default: Each "Event of Default" listed in Section 6 of
the Note shall constitute an "EVENT OF DEFAULT" hereunder. In addition, any
breach or violation of any material warranty or covenant in this Agreement, or
the inaccuracy of any representation herein as of the date when it is made,
shall constitute an Event of Default hereunder.

         6. Rights And Remedies: Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default,
Secured Party shall be entitled to exercise any and all rights and remedies of
secured parties under the Uniform Commercial Code ("UCC") for the State of
