6.2 TIME OF ESSENCE

         Time is of the essence of this 2003 Agreement.

6.3 ASSIGNMENT AND TRANSFER

6.3.1 ASSIGNMENT

        This 2003 Agreement  shall enure to the benefit of and be enforceable by
each of the parties and their respective permitted successors and assigns.  AACI
may, in its sole  discretion,  assign the  benefits of this 2003  Agreement,  in
whole or in part and in any manner, to any affiliated or related entities or its
lenders,  respectively, and agrees to notify PTSX of such assignment. Each party
shall remain primarily liable for its obligations hereunder. This 2003 Agreement
may not be assigned by PTSX without the express written consent of AACI.

6.3.2 TRANSFER OF SHARES

        PTSX  acknowledges  and agrees  that AACI may,  in its sole  discretion,
transfer or sell any or all of the Optioned  Shares to any affiliated or related
entity;  provided that such affiliated or related entities shall, as a condition
to such transfer  agree to be bound by all of the terms of this 2003  Agreement;
and  provided  further that such  transfer  shall not relieve AACI of any of its
obligations or liability under this 2003 Agreement, and that such transfer shall
not impair the right of PTSX to exercise the Option.

6.4 COUNTERPARTS

        This  2003  Agreement  may be  signed  in  counterparts  and  each  such
counterpart shall constitute an original document and such  counterparts,  taken
together, shall constitute one and the same instrument.

6.5 ATTORNEYS' FEES

        If any action at law or  equity,  including  an action  for  declaratory
relief, is brought to enforce or interpret any provision of this 2003 Agreement,
the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys' fees
and expenses from the other party,  which fees and expenses shall be in addition
to any other relief which may be awarded.

6.6 COUNTERPARTS; FACSIMILE SIGNATURES

        This 2003 Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts,  all of
which when taken  together  shall be considered  one and the same  agreement and
shall  become  effective  when  counterparts  have been signed by each party and
delivered to the other parties,  it being  understood that both parties need not
sign  the  same  counterpart.   If  any  signature  is  delivered  by  facsimile
transmission,  such signature shall create a valid and binding obligation of the
party  executing  (or on whose behalf such  signature is executed) the same with
the same force and effect as if such  facsimile  signature page were an original
thereof.

6.7 REMEDIES

        In addition to being entitled to exercise all rights  provided herein or
granted  by law,  including  recovery  of  damages,  PTSX shall be  entitled  to
specific  performance  of the Option  granted by AACI under this 2003  Agreement
without  the showing of  economic  loss and  without any bond or other  security
being  required.  AACI  agrees  that  monetary  damages  would  not be  adequate
compensation  for any loss  incurred  by  reason  of any  breach  by AACI of its
obligations  described in the  foregoing  sentence and hereby agrees to waive in
any action for specific  performance  of any such  obligation the defense that a
remedy at law would be adequate.
