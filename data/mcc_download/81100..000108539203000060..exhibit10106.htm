of which the LC Issuer shall have no duty to ascertain), be subject to the conditions
precedent that such Facility LC shall be satisfactory to the LC Issuer and that the
Borrower shall have executed and delivered such application agreement and/or such other
instruments and agreements relating to such Facility LC as the LC Issuer shall have
reasonably requested (each, a &#147;Facility LC Application&#148;). In the event of any
conflict between the terms of this Agreement and the terms of any Facility LC
Application, the terms of this Agreement shall control.  </FONT></P></TD>

written notice thereof to the Lenders and the Borrower, such resignation to be effective
upon the appointment of a successor Administrative Agent or, if no successor
Administrative Agent has been appointed, 45 days after the retiring Administrative Agent
gives notice of its intention to resign. The Administrative Agent may be removed at any
time with or without cause by written notice received by the Administrative Agent from
the Required Lenders, such removal to be effective on the date specified by the Required
Lenders. Upon any such resignation or removal, the Required Lenders with the consent of
the Borrower (so long as no Default or Unmatured Default exists), which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed, shall have the right to appoint, on behalf of the
Borrower and the Lenders, a successor Administrative Agent. If no successor
Administrative Agent shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders within thirty
days after the resigning Administrative Agent&#146;s giving notice of its intention to
resign, then the resigning Administrative Agent may appoint, on behalf of the Borrower
and the Lenders, a successor Administrative Agent. Notwithstanding the previous sentence,
the Administrative Agent may at any time without the consent of the Borrower or any
Lender, appoint any of its Affiliates which is a commercial bank as a successor
Administrative Agent hereunder. If the Administrative Agent has resigned or been removed
and no successor Administrative Agent has been appointed, the Lenders may perform all the
duties of the Administrative Agent hereunder and the Borrower shall make all payments in
respect of the Obligations to the applicable Lender and for all other purposes shall deal
directly with the Lenders. No successor Administrative Agent shall be deemed to be
appointed hereunder until such successor Administrative Agent has accepted the
appointment. Any such successor Administrative Agent shall be a commercial bank having
capital and retained earnings of at least $100,000,000. Upon the acceptance of any
appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor Administrative Agent, such
successor Administrative Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the
rights, powers, privileges and duties of the resigning or removed Administrative Agent.
Upon the effectiveness of the resignation or removal of the Administrative Agent, the
resigning or removed Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and
obligations hereunder and under the Loan Documents. After the effectiveness of the
resignation or removal of an Administrative Agent, the provisions of this Article X shall
continue in effect for the benefit of such Administrative Agent in respect of any actions
taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as the Administrative Agent
hereunder and under the other Loan Documents. In the event that there is a successor to
the Administrative Agent by merger, or the Administrative Agent assigns its duties and
obligations to an Affiliate pursuant to this Section 10.12, then the term &#147;Prime Rate&#148; as
used in this Agreement shall mean the prime rate, corporate base rate or other analogous
rate of the new Administrative Agent.  </FONT></P></TD>
