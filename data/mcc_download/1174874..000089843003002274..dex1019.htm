issuance of an injunction.&#160; However, either party may, without inconsistency with this arbitration provision, apply to any court having jurisdiction over such dispute or controversy and seek interim provisional, injunctive or other equitable

Employer; <u>provided</u>, <u>however</u>, that the arbitrator shall have the authority to require either party to pay a portion or all of arbitrator fees to the same extent as a court could award costs in a civil proceeding.&#160; The decision of
the arbitrator shall be a reasoned opinion, including findings of fact and conclusions of law.&#160; The arbitrator shall have jurisdiction to correct errors in his or her decision on motion of either party or <i>sua sponte</i>.</font></p> <p><font
