                                       II

                           AMOUNT AND TERMS OF LOANS

     II.1 Commitment and Loans. Subject to the terms and conditions contained in
this Agreement, Lender agrees to make loans ("Loans") to Borrower on a revolving
credit basis from time to time on any Business Day from the date of this
Agreement through the Drawdown Termination Date; provided that no Wet Loans
shall be made on or after January 1, 2003. The aggregate amount of all Loans
requested in any Borrowing Notice must be greater than or equal to $25,000 or
the unadvanced portion of the Borrowing Base. After giving effect to the
transactions contemplated by the Borrowing Request pursuant to which a Loan is
requested, and at all other times, the aggregate amount of all Loans outstanding
shall not exceed the lesser of (i) the Collateral Value of the Borrowing Base
and (ii) the Commitment.

     II.2 Promissory Note; Interest on the Note. The obligation of Borrower to
repay the Loans made by Lender, together with interest accruing in connection
therewith, shall be evidenced by a Note payable to the order of Lender. Interest
on the Note shall be due and payable as provided herein and therein. The entire
Loan Balance and all accrued and unpaid interest thereon shall be finally due
and payable on the Drawdown Termination Date.

     II.3 Notice and Manner of Obtaining Loans. Borrower must give written
notice, or telephonic notice promptly confirmed in writing, of each request for
Loans. Each such written request or confirmation must be made in writing in the
form and substance of the "Borrowing Request" attached hereto as Exhibit B, duly
completed. Each such Borrowing Request must:

                                       14

<PAGE>

     (a)  specify the aggregate amount of any such Borrowing of new Loans and
the date on which such Loans are to be advanced; and

     (b)  be received by Lender not later than 2:00 p.m., Dallas, Texas, time,
on the day on which any such Loans are to be made.

Each such telephonic request shall be deemed a representation, warranty,
acknowledgment and agreement by Borrower as to the matters which are required to
be set out in such written confirmation. If all conditions precedent to such
Loan have been met Lender will on the date requested promptly remit to Borrower
the amount of such Loan in immediately available dollars, by crediting the
Funding Account with immediately available funds as the amount of such Loan.

     II.4 Fees.

     (a)  In consideration of Borrower's commitment to make the Loans, Borrower
will pay to Lender a non-refundable commitment fee in the amount of $17,500
(calculated as of December 1, 2002 and will be adjusted to actual closing date).
This commitment fee shall be due and payable on the date hereof.

     (b)  In consideration of Lender's commitment to make the Loans, Borrowers
will pay to Lender in advance on the first day of such Fiscal Quarter a
non-refundable, facility fee determined on a daily basis by applying a rate of
twelve and one-half basis points (.125%) per annum to the Commitment on each day
during such Fiscal Quarter. A prorated fee for the Fiscal Quarter ending
December 31, 2002, shall be due and payable on the date hereof.

     (c)  Borrower shall pay to Lender, a collateral handling fee in the amount
of $15 for each Mortgage Loan file.

     II.5 Mandatory Repayments. If at any time the Loan Balance exceeds the
Collateral Value of the Borrowing Base, Borrower shall repay the amount of such
excess within one (1) Business Day after written notice thereof is given by
Lender to Borrower.

     II.6 Payments to Lender. All payments of interest on the Note, all payments
of principal, including any principal payment made with proceeds of Mortgage
Collateral, and fees hereunder shall be made directly to Lender in federal or
other immediately available funds before 1:00 pm (Dallas, Texas time) on the
respective dates when due via wire transfer to the Settlement Account. Borrower
shall send notice to Lender before 1:00 p.m. (Dallas, Texas time) on the day any
payment of principal or interest is received by Lender which sets forth the
Loans against which such payment is to be applied. Any payment (or any payment
received without a notice regarding application of such payment) received by
Lender after such time will be deemed to have been made on the next following
Business Day. Should any such payment become due and payable on a day other than
a Business Day, the maturity of such payment shall be extended to the next
succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of a payment of principal or past due
interest, interest shall accrue and be payable thereon for the period of such
extension as provided in the Loan Document under which such payment is due. Each
payment under a Loan Document shall be payable at the place provided therein
and, if no specific place of payment is provided, shall be payable at the place
of payment of the Note. When Lender collects or receives money on account of the
Obligations, Lender shall apply all such money so distributed, as follows:

          (a) first, for the payment of all Obligations which are then due, and
     if such money is insufficient to pay all such Obligations, (i) first to any
     reimbursements due Lender under Section

                                       15

<PAGE>

     5.5, (ii) second, to the payment of the Loans then due, and (iii) then to
     the partial payment of all other Obligations then due in proportion to the
     amounts thereof, or as Lender shall otherwise agree;

           (b) then for the prepayment of amounts owing under the Loan Documents
     if so specified by Borrower;

           (c) then for the prepayment of principal on the Note, together with
     accrued and unpaid interest on the principal so prepaid; and

           (d) last, for the payment or prepayment of any other Obligations.

All payments applied to principal or interest on any Note shall be applied first
to any interest then due and payable, then to principal then due and payable,
and last to any prepayment of principal and interest.

     II.7  Increased Cost and Reduced Return.

     (a)   If, after the date hereof, Lender shall have determined that the
adoption of any applicable Law, rule, or regulation regarding capital adequacy
or any change therein or in the interpretation or administration thereof by any
governmental authority, central bank, or comparable agency charged with the
interpretation or administration thereof, or any request or directive regarding
capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of Law) of any such
governmental authority, central bank, or comparable agency, has or would have
the effect of reducing the rate of return on the capital of Lender or any
corporation controlling Lender, due to the obligations of Lender hereunder, to a
level below that which Lender or such corporation could have achieved but for
such adoption, change, request, or directive (taking into consideration its
policies with respect to capital adequacy), then, within fifteen (15) days after
demand by Lender, Borrower shall pay to Lender such additional amount or amounts
as will compensate Lender for such reduction, but only to the extent that Lender
has not been compensated therefor by any increase in the Adjusted Eurodollar
Rate.

     (b)   Lender shall promptly notify Borrower of any event of which it has
knowledge, occurring after the date hereof, which will entitle Lender to
compensation pursuant to this Section. In the event that Lender claims
compensation under this Section, Lender shall furnish to Borrower a statement
setting forth the additional amount or amounts to be paid to it hereunder which
shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. In determining such
amount, Lender shall act in good faith and may use any reasonable averaging and
attribution methods.

                                      III

which it is a party; each Related Person is duly authorized to and has taken all
corporate action necessary to authorize it to, execute, deliver and perform the
Loan Documents to which it is a party and is and will continue to be duly

<PAGE>

Related Person is subject, or any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, or other
agreement or instrument to which any Related Person is a party or by which any
Related Person may be bound, or to which the Property of any Related Person may
be subject, or (b) result in the creation or imposition of any Lien, other than

obtained and actions previously taken, neither the execution and delivery of
this Agreement, the Note and the other Loan Documents to which any Related
Person is a party, nor the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby requires the consent or approval of, the giving of notice to,

Authority which has jurisdiction over each Related Person or any of its
Property, except for (a) the filing of the Uniform Commercial Code financing

diminish the right of Lender to rely thereon.

     IV.21 Individual Mortgage Loans. Borrower hereby represents with respect to
each Mortgage Note and Mortgage Loan that is part of the Collateral:

     (a)   Borrower has good and marketable title to each Mortgage Note and

"margin stock" or of maintaining, reducing or retiring any Indebtedness
originally incurred to purchase a stock that is currently any "margin stock," or
for any other purpose which might constitute this transaction a "purpose
credit," in each case within the meaning of Regulation G of the Board of

exchange of property or the rendering of any service, with any Affiliate unless
such transactions are otherwise permitted under this Agreement, are in the

less favorable to Borrower than it would obtain in a comparable arm's length
transaction with a Person not an Affiliate.

Agreement, the Security Instruments, the Note, or any other Loan Document, nor
consent to any departure by any Related Person from the terms thereof, shall in

such party is Borrower, by Borrower and (ii) if such party is Lender, by Lender.

     IX.3 CHOICE OF LAW; VENUE. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF
THE STATE OF TEXAS. ANY LEGAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR IN
CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE BROUGHT AND MAINTAINED IN THE APPLICABLE
STATE OR FEDERAL COURT IN DALLAS COUNTY, TEXAS. THIS AGREEMENT IS PERFORMABLE IN
DALLAS COUNTY, TEXAS AND THE PARTIES HERETO WAIVE ANY RIGHT THEY MAY HAVE TO BE
SUED ELSEWHERE. THE PARTIES HERETO CONSENT TO PERSONAL JURISDICTION IN DALLAS
COUNTY, TEXAS. Section 346 of the Texas Finance Code (which regulates certain
revolving loan accounts and revolving triparty accounts) shall not apply to this
Agreement or the other Loan Documents.

     IX.4 Invalidity. In the event that any one or more of the provisions
contained in the Note, this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall, for any
reason, be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such
invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision
of such document.

     IX.5 Survival of Agreements. All covenants and agreements herein and in any
other Loan Document not fully performed before the date hereof or the date
thereof, and all representations and warranties herein or therein, shall survive
until payment in full of the Obligations and termination of the Commitment.

     IX.6 Renewal, Extension or Rearrangement. All provisions of this Agreement
and of the other Loan Documents shall apply with equal force and effect to each
promissory note hereafter executed which in whole or in part represents a
renewal, extension for any period, increase or rearrangement of any part of the
Obligations originally represented by the Note or of any part of such other
Obligations.

     IX.7 Waivers. No course of dealing on the part of Lender, or any of its
officers, employees, consultants or agents, nor any failure or delay by Lender
with respect to exercising any right, power or privilege of Lender under the
Note, this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall operate as a waiver
thereof, except as otherwise provided in Section 9.2 hereof.

     IX.8 Cumulative Rights. The rights and remedies of Lender under the Note,
this Agreement, and any other Loan Document shall be cumulative, and the
exercise or partial exercise of any such right or remedy shall not preclude the
exercise of any other right or remedy.

     IX.9 Limitation on Interest. Lender, each Related Person and any other
parties to the Loan Documents intend to contract in strict compliance with
applicable usury Law from time to time in effect. In furtherance thereof such
Persons stipulate and agree that none of the terms and provisions contained in
the Loan Documents shall ever be construed to create a contract to pay, for the
use, forbearance or detention of money, interest in excess of the maximum amount
of interest permitted to be charged by applicable Law from time to time in
effect. Neither each Related Person nor any present or future guarantors,
endorsers, or other Persons hereafter becoming liable for payment of any
Obligation shall ever be liable for unearned interest thereon or shall ever be
required to pay interest thereon in excess of the maximum amount that may be
lawfully charged under applicable Law from time to time in effect, and the
provisions of this section shall control over all other provisions of the Loan
Documents which may be in

                                       33

<PAGE>

conflict or apparent conflict herewith. Lender expressly disavows any intention
to charge or collect excessive unearned interest or finance charges in the event
the maturity of any Obligation is accelerated. If (a) the maturity of any
Obligation is accelerated for any reason, (b) any Obligation is prepaid and as a
result any amounts held to constitute interest are determined to be in excess of
the legal maximum, or (c) Lender or any other holder of any or all of the
Obligations shall otherwise collect moneys which are determined to constitute
interest which would otherwise increase the interest on any or all of the
Obligations to an amount in excess of that permitted to be charged by applicable
Law then in effect, then all such sums determined to constitute interest in
excess of such legal limit shall, without penalty, be promptly applied to reduce
the then outstanding principal of the related Obligations or, at Lender's or
such holder's option, promptly returned to each Related Person or the other
payor thereof upon such determination. In determining whether or not the
interest paid or payable, under any specific circumstance, exceeds the maximum
amount permitted under applicable Law, Lender and each Related Persons (and any
other payors thereof) shall to the greatest extent permitted under applicable
Law, (i) characterize any non-principal payment as an expense, fee or premium
rather than as interest, (ii) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects
thereof, and (iii) amortize, prorate, allocate, and spread the total amount of
interest throughout the entire contemplated term of the instruments evidencing
the Obligations in accordance with the amounts outstanding from time to time
thereunder and the maximum legal rate of interest from time to time in effect
under applicable Law in order to lawfully charge the maximum amount of interest
permitted under applicable Law. In the event applicable Law provides for an
interest ceiling under Section 303 of the Texas Finance Code, that ceiling shall
be the weekly ceiling.

     IX.10 Bank Accounts; Offset. To secure the repayment of the Obligations
each Related Person hereby grants to Lender and to each financial institution
which hereafter acquires a participation or other interest in the Loans or Note
(in this section called a "Participant") a security interest, a lien, and a
right of offset, each of which shall be in addition to all other interests,
liens, and rights of Lender or any Participant at common law, under the Loan
Documents, or otherwise, and each of which shall be upon and against (a) any and
all moneys, securities or other property (and the proceeds therefrom) of any
Related Person now or hereafter held or received by or in transit to Lender, any
Lender or Participant from or for the account of any Related Person, whether for
safekeeping, custody pledge, transmission, collection or otherwise, (b) any and
all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) of any
Related Person with Lender or any Participant, and (c) any other credits and
claims of any Related Person at any time existing against Lender, any Lender or
Participant, including claims under certificates of deposit. Upon the occurrence
of any Default, each of Lender and Participants is hereby authorized to
foreclose upon, offset, appropriate, and apply, at any time and from time to
time, without notice to Borrower, any and all items hereinabove referred to
against the Obligations then due and payable.

     IX.11 Assignments, Participations.

     (a)   Assignments. Lender shall have the right to sell, assign or transfer
all or any part of Note, Loans and rights and the associated rights and

have, to the extent of such sale, assignment, or transfer, the same rights,
benefits and obligations of Lender. Within five (5) Business Days after any such
assignment, the assignee shall notify Borrower of the outstanding principal
balance of the Note payable to assignee and Borrower shall execute and deliver
to assignee a new Note evidencing such assignee's assigned Loans and, if the
assignor Lender has retained a portion of its Loans, replacement Note in the
principal amount of the Loans retained by the assignor Lender (such Note to be
in exchange for, but not in payment of, the Note held by such Lender).

PARTIES.

a notice, if no Obligations are then owing, this Agreement and all other Loan
