9.3(A)    None of the limitations on the liability of the Warrantors set out
          in clause 9.1(A) shall apply to a Warrantor regarding any Claim or Tax
          Claim if such claim involves any fraud or wilful concealment on the

          Warranties and/or under the Tax Deed:-

          9.5.1(A)  if such Claim would not have arisen but for a change in law

                    practices, bases or principles after the date of Completion,
                    where such change or withdrawal purports to be effective
                    retrospectively and which was not announced before
                    Completion;

          9.5.2(A)  to the extent of any specific provision, or specific
                    allowance is made for the specific subject matter of such
                    breach in the Completion Accounts;

          9.5.3(A)  in respect of any liability where the liability would not

                         or

                    (e)  at the written request of Warrantors; or

                    (f)  as a mandatory requirement of GAAP in the UK or
                         Australia, as the case may be; and

          9.5.4(A)  if, in respect of any matter which would give rise to a

9.6(A)    There shall be no liability to make payment in respect of Claims
          (but such liability will subsist) in respect of a liability which is
          contingent until such contingency has crystallised following which the
          liability will become an actual liability and will be due and payable.

          practicable in order to avoid, dispute, resist, mitigate, compromise,
          defend or appeal against any claim by a third party against it which
          will or may give rise to a Claim and the Buyer shall:-

          9.8.1(A)  act in accordance with such reasonable requirements subject
                    to the Buyer being properly indemnified in advance by cash
                    collateral by the Warrantors to the reasonable satisfaction
                    of the Buyer against all reasonable costs and expenses,
                    (both of itself and all third parties), reasonably incurred
                    or anticipated in connection with the taking of steps or
                    proceedings and such cash collateral being promptly and

                    steps or proceedings should be taken in order to do so, the
                    Buyer shall, or shall procure that the Company shall not
                    make any admission of liability, agreement or compromise
                    with any person, body or authority without the prior
                    agreement of the Warrantors which shall not be unreasonably
                    withheld or delayed;

          9.8.3(A)  give the Warrantors (or their duly authorised
                    representatives) reasonable access to the personnel and any
                    premises, assets, accounts, documents and records which are
                    relevant to such claim and are within the power, possession

          representations or Warranties other than those incorporated in this
          Agreement and the Disclosure Letter.

          Nothing contained in this clause shall have the effect of excluding
          any warranties on the part of the Sellers nor the Purchaser's reliance
          on them where such warranty was made fraudulently or there has been
          wilful concealment of any matter or thing.

                    dismiss an executive director for reasons provided for in
                    the relevant Service Agreement;

          14.3.5    in order to protect the interests of the Sellers during the
                    Relevant Period, the Buyer shall take such steps as may be
                    necessary to ensure that, save with the written consent of
                    the Committee (which shall not unreasonably be withheld):-

                         Buyer) and that neither the Company nor the Subsidiary
                         is wound up or put into receivership or administration
                         or other similar process;

                    (c)  the Company is run as a stand alone business unit and
                         that no business is diverted away from the Company or

                         depressing the gross income of the Company;

                    (d)  no steps are taken intended only to diminish the gross
                         income of the Company or the Subsidiary in the absence
                         of a bona fide commercial reason not inconsistent with
                         sub-clause 14.3.5(c) above; and

                         will be maintained by the Company and the Subsidiary as

          Australia continues to be consolidated with that of the Company.

                    person directly or indirectly at any time after the
                    Completion Date uses the name e-pay or any name likely to be
                    confused with such name in the minds of members of the
                    public for the purposes of a business similar to or
                    competing with the business of any Group Company or the

          15.2.6    except as required by Law, he will not at any time do or say

                    engage in business with the Company or any Group Company or
                    the Associated Corporation.

          PROVIDED THAT (but except in relation to its Restricted Business)
          nothing contained in this clause 15 shall prevent the Seller from at
          any time holding for investment purposes only any class of securities
          for the time being listed or dealt in on any recognised investment
          exchange (as defined in the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000)
          or the Australian Stock Exchange or other stock of investment exchange
          where securities are publicly traded.

15.3      The covenants contained in clause 15.1 shall be deemed to be in
          respect of each part entire, separate, severable and separately
          enforceable so that each covenant shall be deemed to be a separate
          covenant notwithstanding the fact that it appears in the same clause,
          sub-clause or sentence or any other covenant or is imposed by the
          introduction of a word or phrase conjunctively with or disjunctively
          from or alternatively to other words or phrases.

          15.4.1    the restrictions have been negotiated and agreed on an arm's
                    length basis and are reasonable when taken together as well
                    as individually;

          15.4.2    the duration, extent and application of each restriction is
                    no greater than is necessary for the protection of the
                    goodwill of the business of the Company, the Subsidiary and
                    the Associated Corporation (as applicable); and

          15.4.3    the consideration paid by the Buyer for the Shares takes
                    into account and provides adequate compensation for the
                    Sellers for the restraint and restrictions imposed.

                                       26

          to another company which is a subsidiary of the Buyer (the "Transferee
          Company"), each of the restrictions contained in this clause 15 shall
          continue to apply, mutatis mutandis, in relation to the business
          transferred as carried on from time to time by the Transferee Company

          connection with the negotiation, preparation and execution of this
          Agreement shall be borne solely by the Party who shall have incurred

          rights he may have in such regard):-

          17.1.1    lawfully to exercise all voting and other rights and receive

                    specified in sub-clauses 17.1.1 and 17.1.2 as the Buyer

                    Buyer were the absolute legal and beneficial owner of such
                    Shares.

17.2      Each of the Sellers undertakes to the Buyer to ratify everything that
          the Buyer shall lawfully do or purport to do pursuant to clause 17.1.

          has done during the 12 months prior to the date of this Agreement; and

15.2      is fully functional.

          substantial modification, replacement or enhancement to permit the
          Company to carry out its business as currently carried on in a proper
          and efficient manner over the next 12 months.

                       METHOD OF PAYMENT OF EURONET SHARES

1.        The number of Euronet Shares issued to the Sellers (in accordance with
          the Consideration Schedule) shall be equal to (pound)11,889,743
          (eleven million eight hundred and eighty-nine thousand seven hundred
          and forty-three pounds sterling) converted into dollars at:-

1.1      the Exchange Rate, divided by the Closing Stock Price; and

1.2       rounded up so that each of the Sellers receives a whole number of
          shares.

2.        Except for Permitted Transfers (as defined below) and subject to
          compliance with Paragraph 4.4 hereof, each of the Holders (as defined
          below) shall be prohibited from transferring, disposing, assigning or
          encumbering any of the Euronet Shares for a period of 12 months
          following the Completion Date ("Transfer Restriction Period")
          provided, however, that this restriction shall not apply with respect
          to shares issued following an election by the Buyer to require
          redemption pursuant to section 7(c) of the Convertible Notes.

          "Permitted Transfer" means any transfer (a)(i) to a personal trust of
          such Holder; (ii) to members of such Holder's immediate family; (iii)
          to any trust for the benefit of any such person; (iv) to the estate of
          any of the foregoing by gift, will or intestate succession; (v) by
          will or the laws of descent and distribution; (vi) to non-profit
          institutions, by gift of will; or (vii) to an "affiliate" (as such
          term is defined under Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act) of such Holder;
          provided, that any such transferee agrees in writing to be bound by
          the transfer restrictions on such securities contemplated hereunder
          and any such transfer complies with the provisions of Paragraph 4.4
          hereof; or (b) pursuant to the Registration Statement of any shares
          issued upon redemption pursuant to Section 7 of the Convertible Note.

          For the purposes of this Schedule 11, the term "Holder" shall mean
          each of the Sellers and their Permitted Transferees.

3.        Total dilution arising from the issue by the Buyer of the Euronet
          Shares (including such Euronet Shares that are issuable upon
          conversion or redemption of the Convertible Note) shall not equal or
          exceed 20% of the outstanding Common Stock of the Buyer immediately

                    pursuant to Rule 144(k) or any other rule of similar effect
                    or (B) such date as all of the Holders' Registrable Shares
                    shall have been resold; (ii) file with the SEC in a timely
                    manner all reports and other documents required of the Buyer
                    under the Securities Act and under the United States
                    Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange
                    Act"); and (iii) furnish to the Holders upon request, as
                    long as any Holder owns any Registrable Shares, (A) a
                    written statement by the Buyer that it has complied with the
                    reporting requirements of the Securities Act and the
                    Exchange Act, (B) a copy of the Buyer's most recent Annual
                    Report on Form 10-K or Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and
                    (C) such other information as may be reasonably requested in
                    order to avail the Holders of any rule or regulation of the
                    SEC that permits the selling of any such Registrable Shares
                    without registration.

          4.1.3     It shall be a condition precedent to the obligations of the
                    Buyer to take any action pursuant to this Paragraph 4.1 that
                    the Holders shall furnish to the Buyer such information
                    regarding itself, the Registrable Shares to be sold by the
                    Holders, and the intended method of disposition of such
                    securities as shall be required to effect the registration
                    of the Registrable Shares.

4.2       TRANSFER OF SHARES AFTER REGISTRATION; SUSPENSIONS; BLACKOUTS

          4.2.1     Each Holder agrees that it will not effect any sale or other
                    transfer of the Registrable Shares except as contemplated in
                    the Registration Statement referred to in Paragraph 4.1 and
                    as described below, and that it will promptly notify the
                    Buyer of any changes in the information set forth in the
                    Registration Statement regarding each Holder or its
                    respective plan of distribution.

          4.2.2     Except in the event that subparagraphs 4.2.3 or 4.2.4 below
                    applies, the Buyer shall: (i) if deemed necessary by the
                    Buyer, prepare and file from time to time with the SEC a
                    post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement or a
                    supplement to the related Prospectus or a supplement or
                    amendment to any document incorporated therein by reference
                    or file any other required document so that such
                    Registration Statement will not contain an untrue statement
                    of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required
                    to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements

                                       86

<PAGE>

                    therein not misleading, and so that, as thereafter delivered
                    to purchasers of the Registrable Shares being sold
                    thereunder, such Prospectus will not contain an untrue
                    statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
                    fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
                    statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
                    which they were made, not misleading; (ii) provide each
                    Holder with copies of any documents filed pursuant to
                    subparagraphs 4.2.2(i); and 4.2.2(iii) inform each Holder
                    that the Buyer has complied with its obligations in
                    subparagraph 4.2.2(i) (or that, if the Buyer has filed a
                    post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement which
                    has not yet been declared effective, the Buyer will notify
                    each Holder to that effect, will use its commercially
                    reasonable efforts to secure the effectiveness of such
                    post-effective amendment as promptly as practicable and will
                    promptly notify each Holder pursuant to subparagraph
                    4.2.2(i) hereof when the amendment has become effective).

          4.2.3     Subject to subparagraph 4.2.5 below, in the event: (i) of
                    any request by the SEC or any other federal or state
                    governmental authority during the period of effectiveness of
                    the Registration Statement for amendments or supplements to
                    the Registration Statement or related Prospectus or for
                    additional information; (ii) of the issuance by the SEC or
                    any other federal or state governmental authority of any
                    stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration
                    Statement or the initiation of any proceedings for that
                    purpose; (iii) of the receipt by the Buyer of any
                    notification with respect to the suspension of the
                    qualification or exemption from qualification of any of the
                    Registrable Shares for sale in any jurisdiction or the
                    initiation of any proceeding for such purpose; or (iv) of
                    any event or circumstance which necessitates the making of
                    any changes in the Registration Statement or Prospectus, or
                    any document incorporated or deemed to be incorporated
                    therein by reference, so that, in the case of the
                    Registration Statement, it will not contain any untrue
                    statement of a material fact or any omission to state a
                    material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
                    make the statements therein not misleading, and that in the
                    case of the Prospectus, it will not contain any untrue
                    statement of a material fact or any omission to state a
                    material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
                    make the statements therein, in the light of the
                    circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;
                    then the Buyer shall deliver a certificate in writing to
                    each Holder (the "Suspension Notice") to the effect of the
                    foregoing and, upon receipt of such Suspension Notice, each
                    Holder will suspend offers and sales of Registrable Shares
                    pursuant to the Registration Statement (a "Suspension")
                    until such Holder's receipt of copies of a supplemented or
                    amended Prospectus prepared and filed by the Buyer, or until
                    it is advised in writing by the Buyer that the current
                    Prospectus may be used, and has received copies of any
                    additional or supplemental filings that are incorporated or
                    deemed incorporated by reference in any such Prospectus. In
                    the event of any Suspension, the Buyer will use its
                    commercially reasonable efforts to cause the use of the
                    Prospectus so suspended to be resumed as soon as reasonably
                    practicable after delivery of a Suspension Notice to the
                    Holders.

          4.2.4     Subject to subparagraph 4.2.5 below, if at any time the
                    Buyer notifies the Holders (as contemplated by subparagraph
                    4.2.3 above) the Buyer also notifies the Holders that the
                    event giving rise to such notice relates to a

                                       87

<PAGE>

                    development involving the Buyer which occurred subsequent to
                    the later of (i) the effective date of the Registration
                    Statement and (ii) the latest date prior to such notice on
                    which the Buyer has amended or supplemented the Registration
                    Statement, then the Buyer shall not be required to use its
                    commercially reasonable efforts to make any changes to the
                    Registration Statement or Prospectus, or any document
                    incorporated or deemed to be incorporated therein by
                    reference, during a period of up to 45 consecutive days as
                    specified in the notice contemplated herein (a "Blackout
                    Period") and each Holder shall suspend offers and sales of
                    Registrable Securities pursuant to the Registration
                    Statement during each Blackout Period; provided, however,
                    that in any period of 365 consecutive days the Buyer shall
                    not be entitled to avail itself of its rights under this
                    subparagraph 4.2.4 with respect to more than two Blackout
                    Periods, unless in the good faith judgment of the Buyer's
                    Board of Directors, upon advice of counsel, the offer and
                    sale of Registrable Shares would be reasonably likely to
                    cause a violation of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act
                    and result in potential liability of the Buyer.

          4.2.5     Provided that a Suspension or a Blackout Period is not then
                    in effect, the Holders may sell Registrable Shares under the
                    Registration Statement, provided that each such Holder
                    arranges for delivery of a current Prospectus to the
                    transferee of such Registrable Shares. Upon receipt of a
                    request therefor, the Buyer agrees to provide an adequate
                    number of current Prospectuses to each Holder and to supply
                    copies to any other parties requiring such Prospectuses.

          4.2.6     In the event of a sale of Registrable Shares by a Holder,
                    such Holder shall also deliver to the Buyer's transfer
                    agent, with a copy to the Buyer, a notice of such sale so
                    that the Registrable Shares may be properly transferred.

4.3       INDEMNIFICATION

          4.3.1     Indemnification by the Buyer. Upon the registration of the
                    Registrable Shares pursuant to Paragraph 4.1 hereof, Buyer
                    shall, and it hereby agrees to, indemnify and hold harmless
                    Holders, the directors and officers and partners of such
                    Holders and each other person, if any, who controls any
                    Holder within the meaning of the Securities Act, from and
                    against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities,
                    joint or several, and expenses (including reasonable fees of
                    counsel and any amounts paid in any settlement effected with
                    the consent of Buyer) to which such Holder, such director,
                    officer or partner of such Holder or such controlling person
                    may become subject under the Securities Act, common law or
                    otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or
                    liabilities or expenses (including all such losses, claims,
                    damages, liabilities and expenses arising out of any actions
                    or proceedings, whether commenced or threatened) arise out
                    of or are based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged
                    untrue statement of any material fact contained in the
                    Registration Statement or any preliminary, final or summary
                    prospectus contained therein, or any amendment or supplement
                    thereto, or (ii) any omission or alleged omission to state
                    therein a material fact required to be stated therein or
                    necessary to make

                                       88

<PAGE>

                    the statement therein not misleading; provided, however,
                    that Buyer shall not be liable to any such person in any
                    such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage,
                    liability (or action or proceeding, whether commenced or
                    threatened, in respect thereof) or expense arises out of or
                    is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue
                    statement or omission or alleged omission made in such
                    Registration Statement, or preliminary, final or summary
                    prospectus, or amendment or supplement in reliance upon and
                    in conformity with written information furnished to Buyer by
                    such person expressly for use in the Registration Statement
                    or preliminary, final or summary prospectus, amendment or
                    supplement; and provided further, however, that Buyer will
                    not be liable in any case with respect to any untrue
                    statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or
                    omission made in any preliminary prospectus or prospectus,
                    or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, to the
                    extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability (or
                    action in respect thereof) resulted from the fact that any
                    Holder sold Registrable Shares to a person to whom there was
                    not sent or given, at or prior to the written confirmation
                    of such sale, a copy of the prospectus as then amended or
                    supplemented in any case where such delivery is required by
                    the Securities Act, if Buyer had previously complied with
                    the provisions of Paragraph 4.1.1(iv) hereof and if the
                    untrue statement contained in or omission from such
                    preliminary prospectus or prospectus was corrected in the
                    prospectus as then amended or supplemented. Such
                    indemnification and reimbursement of expenses shall remain
                    in full force and effect regardless of any investigation
                    made by or on behalf of such Holder, such director, officer
                    or partner of such Holder or such controlling person and
                    shall survive the transfer of such Registrable Shares by
                    such Holder.

          4.3.2     Indemnification by the Holders. Holders hereby agree,
                    severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless
                    Buyer, each director and officer of Buyer and each other
                    person, if any who controls Buyer within the meaning of the
                    Securities Act, from and against any and all losses, claims,
                    damages or liabilities, joint or several, and expenses
                    (including fees of counsel and any amounts paid in
                    settlement effected with the consent of such holders) to
                    which Buyer, such director or officer or controlling person
                    may become subject under the Securities Act, common law or
                    otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or
                    liabilities or expenses (including all such losses, claims,
                    damages, liabilities and expenses arising out of any actions
                    or proceedings, whether commenced or threatened), arise out
                    of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue
                    statement of any material fact in or omission or alleged
                    omission to state a material fact required to be stated in
                    the Registration Statement, or any preliminary, final or
                    summary prospectus contained therein, or any amendment or
                    supplement thereto, or necessary to make the statements
                    therein not misleading, to the extent, but only to the
                    extent, such statement or alleged statement or omission or
                    alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity
                    with written information furnished to Buyer by or on behalf
                    of such Holder expressly for use in the Registration
                    Statement or preliminary, final or summary prospectus,
                    amendment or supplement; provided, however, that no such
                    Holder shall be liable to any such person

                                       89

<PAGE>

                    under this Paragraph 4.3.2 for any amounts in excess of the
                    dollar amount of the proceeds to be received by such Holder
                    from the sale of such Holder's Registrable Shares pursuant
                    to such registration. Such indemnification and reimbursement
                    of expenses shall remain in full force and effect regardless
                    of any investigation made by or on behalf of Buyer or any of
                    its directors, officers or controlling persons or any of the
                    Holders of Registrable Shares or their respective directors,
                    officers, partners and controlling persons and shall survive
                    the transfer of such Registrable Shares by such Holder.

          4.3.3     Notices of Claims, Etc. Promptly after receipt by an
                    indemnified party hereunder of written notice of the
                    commencement of any action or proceeding with respect to
                    which a claim for indemnification may be made pursuant to
                    this Paragraph 4.3, such indemnified party shall, if a claim
                    in respect thereof is to be made against an indemnifying
                    party, give written notice to the latter of the commencement
                    of such action; provided, however, that the failure of any
                    indemnified party to give notice as provided herein shall
                    not relieve the indemnifying party of any obligations
                    hereunder. In case any such action is brought against an
                    indemnified party, the indemnifying party shall be entitled
                    to participate in and to assume the defence thereof, jointly
                    with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to the
                    extent that it may wish, with counsel reasonably
                    satisfactory to such indemnified party, and after such
                    notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party
                    of its election so to assume the defence thereof, the
                    indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified
                    party for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred
                    by the latter in connection with the defence thereof unless
                    the indemnifying party has failed to assume the defence of
                    such claim and to employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to
                    such indemnified person. An indemnifying party who elects
                    not to assume the defence of a claim shall not be liable for
                    the fees and expenses of more than one counsel in any single
                    jurisdiction for all parties indemnified by such
                    indemnifying party with respect to such claim, or with
                    respect to claims separate but similar or related in the
                    same jurisdiction arising out of the same general
                    allegations. No indemnifying party shall consent to entry of
                    any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to a
                    claim without the consent of the indemnified party, which
                    consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, or unless such
                    judgment or settlement includes as an unconditional term
                    thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such
                    indemnified party of a release from all liability in respect
                    of such claim. No indemnified party shall consent to entry
                    of any judgment or enter into any settlement of any action
                    the defence of which has been assumed by an indemnifying
                    party without the consent of such indemnifying party, which
                    consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

          4.3.4     Contribution.

                    (i)       If for any reason the indemnification provided for
                              in Paragraphs 4.3.1 or 4.3.2 is unavailable to or
                              insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party
                              in respect of any losses, claims, damages or

                              indemnification provisions set forth in Paragraphs
                              4.3.1 or 4.3.2, then the indemnifying party shall
                              contribute to the amount paid or payable by the
                              indemnified party as a result of such losses,
                              claims, damages, liabilities or expenses in such
                              proportion as is appropriate to reflect the
                              relative fault of the indemnifying party and the
                              indemnified party as well as any other relevant
                              equitable considerations. The relative fault of
                              such indemnifying party and indemnified party
                              shall be determined by reference to, among other
                              things, whether any action in question, including
                              any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a
                              material fact or omission or alleged omission to
                              state a material fact, has been made by, or
                              relates to information supplied by, such
                              indemnifying party or indemnified party, and the
                              parties relative intent, knowledge, access to
                              information and opportunity to correct or prevent
                              such action. The amount paid or payable by a party
                              as a result of the losses, claims, damages,
                              liabilities and expenses referred to above shall
                              be deemed to include, subject to the limitations
                              set forth in Paragraph 4.3.3, any legal or other
                              fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such
                              party. In no event shall a Holder be required to
                              contribute an amount greater then the dollar
                              amount of the proceeds received by such holder
                              with respect to the sale of any Registrable
                              Shares.

                    (ii)      The parties hereto agree that it would not be just
                              and equitable if contribution pursuant to this
                              Paragraph 4.3.4 were determined by pro rata
                              allocation or by any other method of allocation
                              which does not take account of the equitable
                              considerations referred to in the immediately
                              preceding paragraph. No person guilty of
                              fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning
                              of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be
                              entitled to contribution from any person who was
                              not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.

                    (iii)     The contribution provided for in this Paragraph
                              4.3.4 shall survive, with respect to a Holder, the
                              transfer of Registrable Shares by such Holder and
                              with respect to a Holder or Buyer shall remain in
                              full force and effect regardless of any
                              investigation made by or on behalf of any
                              indemnified party.

          4.3.5     Other Indemnification. Indemnification and contribution
                    similar to that specified in Paragraphs 4.3.1 to 4.3.4
                    hereof (with appropriate modifications) shall be given by
                    Buyer and each Holder with respect to any required
                    registration or other qualification of such Registrable
                    Shares under any federal or state law or regulation of a
                    governmental authority other than the Securities Act.

          4.3.6     Payments. The indemnification required by this Paragraph 4.3
                    shall be made by periodic payments of the amount thereof
                    during the course of the investigation or defence, as and
                    when bills are received or expense, loss, damage or
                    liability is incurred, subject to refund in the event any
                    such payments are determined not to have been due and owing
                    hereunder.

                    the Securities Act and applicable state and foreign
                    securities laws is available at the time of such transfer,
                    (b) such Holder furnishes to Buyer information from which it
                    can reasonably conclude that the proposed transferee is a
                    Permitted Transferee, (c) such Permitted Transferee agrees
                    in writing to all the terms and conditions hereof and to the

                    Permitted Transferee promptly comply with Paragraph 4.1.3

                    request shall set forth in writing all such information with
                    respect to such proposed underwritten offering as would be
                    required to be included in the Registration Statement. The
                    Buyer shall consider whether or not any such underwritten
                    offering is in its best interests and shall be entitled to
                    accept or deny any such request in its sole discretion. Any
                    such underwritten offering permitted by the Buyer shall be
                    conducted in accordance with customary terms and conditions.

               (i) the average Market Price for the thirty consecutive Trading
Days immediately prior to the Redemption Notice Date exceeds 137.5% of the

Section 8(i) hereof);

               (ii) there are sufficient authorized, unissued and unreserved
shares of Common Stock to effect the redemption;

               (iii) the Common Stock is either listed or admitted to trading on

issuable upon redemption shall equal the aggregate number of whole shares of
Common Stock determined by dividing (i) the sum of the outstanding principal
amount of the Note plus all accrued but unpaid interest thereon, as converted
into U.S. dollars in accordance with the Exchange Rate as of the Trading Day
immediately prior to the Redemption Notice Date, by (ii) the Conversion Price as
of the Trading Day immediately prior to the Redemption Notice Date.


                                       100

<PAGE>

           (c) Redemption Notice. If the Company elects to redeem the Note in
accordance with this Section 7, the Company shall deliver to the Holder a notice
of redemption (the "Redemption Notice"), on a date (the "Redemption Notice
Date") not less than 15 or more than 45 days prior to the date redemption is to
be effected (the "Redemption Date"), stating:

               (i) the Redemption Date;

               (ii) the total amount of principal and accrued but unpaid
interest to be redeemed;

               (iii) the number of shares of Common Stock to be issued on
redemption (the "Redemption Shares"), including the basis for the calculation of
such number and any rounding adjustment made pursuant to Section 7(e);

               (iv) that the Note called for redemption must be surrendered to
the Company to collect the Redemption Shares;

               (v) that, unless the Company defaults in making such redemption
payment, all Conversion Rights (as defined below) terminate after the close of
business one Trading Day prior to the Redemption Date and interest on the Note
called for redemption ceases to accrue on and after the Redemption Date; and

               (vi) that the requirements of the Redemption Conditions have been
met.

The Redemption Notice shall be conclusive evidence of the correctness of the
calculation of the number of Redemption Shares and of any adjustments to such
number made pursuant to this Section 7 in the absence of manifest error. On or
before the Redemption Date, the Company shall issue, or cause the transfer agent
for the Common Stock to prepare and issue, the Redemption Shares in the name of
the Holder before being so delivered by the Company on the Redemption Date.

           (d) Discharge and Satisfaction; Common Stock Legend. The Redemption
Shares shall be duly issued in the name of the Holder. The Redemption Shares,
when issued pursuant to and in compliance with this Section 7, shall be, and for
all purposes shall be deemed to be, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
shares of Common Stock; the issuance and delivery thereof is in all respects
hereby authorized; and the issuance thereof will be, and for all purposes shall
be deemed to be, in full discharge and satisfaction of the Company's obligations
and liability under the Note and the Note shall be retired and cancelled. The
certificates


                                       101

<PAGE>

representing the Redemption Shares shall bear any legend required by any then
existing rights agreement and any restrictive legend required by law.

           (e) No Fractional Shares. Notwithstanding any provision hereof to the
contrary, the Company shall not be required to issue certificates representing
fractions of shares of Common Stock upon the redemption of the Note, nor shall
it be required to issue scrip or pay cash in lieu of fractional interests, it
being the intent of the parties that all fractional interests shall be
eliminated by rounding any fraction of .5 or more up to the nearest whole number
of shares of Common Stock and any fraction of less than .5 down to the nearest
whole number of shares of Common Stock.

           (f) Irrevocable. A Note called for redemption becomes irrevocably due
and payable on the Redemption Date for the number of Redemption Shares
determined pursuant to this Section 7 and, provided that the Redemption Shares
are issued in accordance with this Section 7, shall no longer be convertible
pursuant to Section 8 hereof after the close of business one Trading Day prior
to the Redemption Date. A notice of redemption may not be conditional.

        8. Conversion Rights; Adjustments. The Holder shall have conversion
rights as follows (the "Conversion Rights"):

           (a) Holder's Right to Convert. At any time after the date hereof, the
outstanding principal amount of this Note plus all accrued but unpaid interest
thereon shall be convertible, in whole or in part (subject to Section 8(m)), at
the option of the Holder, at any time and from time to time into fully paid and
nonassessable shares of Common Stock at the then effective Conversion Rate (as
defined below) (each such conversion, a "Holder's Optional Conversion").

        The "Conversion Rate" as of any Conversion Date (as defined below),
shall equal an amount determined by dividing (i) the amount proposed to be
converted into Common Stock outstanding on such date, as converted into U.S.
dollars in accordance with the Exchange Rate as of the Trading Day immediately
prior to the Conversion Date, by (ii) the Conversion Price (as defined below) in
effect as of such Conversion Date. The Conversion Price at which shares of
Common Stock shall be deliverable upon conversion hereof without the payment of
additional consideration by the Holder (the "Conversion Price") shall initially
be $___________[PLUG 150% of the Signing Stock Price, as defined in the Purchase
Agreement]. Such initial Conversion Price shall be subject to adjustment as
provided below.

           (b) Fractional Shares. Notwithstanding any provision hereof to the
contrary, the Company shall not be required to issue certificates representing
fractions of shares of Common Stock upon the conversion of the Note, nor shall
it be required to issue scrip or pay cash in lieu of fractional interests, it
being the intent of the parties that all fractional interests shall be
eliminated by rounding any fraction of .5 or more up to the nearest whole number
of shares of Common Stock and any fraction of less than .5 down to the nearest
whole number of shares of Common Stock.


                                       102

<PAGE>

           (c) Mechanics of Conversion.

               (i) In order to exercise its rights pursuant to a Holder's
Optional Conversion, the Holder shall deliver written notice in the form of
Exhibit A to the Company stating that it elects to convert all or part of the
outstanding principal amount of this Note and accrued but unpaid interest. Such
notice shall state the amount that the Holder seeks to convert and shall be
accompanied by this Note. The date contained in the notice shall be the
conversion date ("Conversion Date") and the Holder shall be deemed to own the
underlying Common Stock as of such date. As soon as practicable (but no later
than three (3) Trading Days) after the Conversion Date, the Company shall
promptly issue and deliver to the Holder a certificate or certificates for the
number of shares of Common Stock to which the Holder is entitled and, in the
case where only part of this Note is converted, the Company shall execute and
deliver a new Note in an aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for
the unconverted portion of the principal amount of the Note so surrendered.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 8, in the case where
only a part of this Note is converted, the amount of the unconverted portion
shall be at least [GBP_______]. Conversions pursuant to this Section 8 shall be
deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close of business on the
Conversion Date. The person entitled to receive the Common Stock issuable upon
such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder of such
Common Stock at the close of business on the Conversion Date.

               (ii) The Company shall at all times during which this Note shall
be outstanding, reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued
stock, for the purpose of effecting the conversion hereof and the Other Notes,
such number of its duly authorized shares of Common Stock as shall from time to
time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all of such outstanding Notes.
Before taking any action which would cause an adjustment reducing the Conversion
Price below the then par value of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon
conversion of this Note and the Other Notes, the Company will take any corporate
action which may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary in order that the
Company may validly and legally issue fully paid and nonassessable shares of
Common Stock at such adjusted Conversion Price.

               (iii) If this Note (or a portion thereof) shall have been
surrendered for conversion as herein provided, it (or such portion) shall no
longer be deemed to be outstanding and all rights with respect hereto, including
the rights, if any, to receive interest, notices and consent rights shall
immediately cease and terminate on the Conversion Date, except only the right of
the Holder to receive shares of Common Stock in exchange therefor. To the extent
so converted, this Note shall be retired and canceled.

               (iv) If a Holder's Optional Conversion is in connection with an
underwritten offering of securities registered pursuant to the 1933 Act, the
conversion may, at the option of the Holder tendering shares for conversion, be
conditioned upon the closing with the underwriter of the sale of securities
pursuant to such offering, in which event the Holder entitled to receive the
Common Stock issuable upon such conversion of the Notes shall not be deemed to
have converted such Notes until immediately prior to the closing of the sale of
securities.


                                       103

<PAGE>

               (v) The certificates representing the shares issued upon
conversion shall bear any legend required by any then existing rights agreement
and any restrictive legend deemed appropriate by the Company.

           (d) Adjustment for Stock Splits and Combinations. If the Company
shall at any time or from time to time after the Issue Date effect a subdivision
of the outstanding Common Stock, the Conversion Price then in effect immediately
before that subdivision shall be proportionately decreased. If the Company shall
at any time or from time to time after the Issue Date combine the outstanding
shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Price then in effect immediately before
the combination shall be proportionately increased. Any adjustment under this
paragraph shall become effective at the close of business on the date the
subdivision or combination becomes effective.

           (e) Adjustment for Certain Dividends and Distributions. In the event
the Company at any time or from time to time after the Issue Date shall make or
issue a dividend or other distribution payable in additional shares of Common
Stock, then and in each such event the Conversion Price shall be decreased as of
the time of such issuance, by multiplying such Conversion Price by a fraction,
the numerator of which shall be the total number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to such issuance and the denominator of which
shall be the total number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately
prior to such issuance plus the number of such additional shares of Common Stock
issuable in payment of such dividend or distribution.

           (f) Adjustments for Other Dividends and Distributions. In the event
the Company at any time, or from time to time after the Issue Date shall make or
issue, a dividend or other distribution payable in securities of the Company
(other than shares of Common Stock) or other assets or properties (including,
without limitation, cash dividends), then and in each such event provision shall
be made so that the Holder and the holders of the Other Notes shall receive in
addition to the number of shares of Common Stock receivable upon conversion of
this Note and the Other Notes, the amount of securities of the Company or other
assets or properties that they would have received had such Notes been converted
into Common Stock on the date of such event and had thereafter, during the
period from the date of such event to and including the Conversion Date,
retained such securities or other assets or properties receivable by them as
aforesaid during such period giving application to all adjustments called for
during such period, under this paragraph with respect to the rights of the
Holder and the holders of the Other Notes; provided that, in the event rights or
benefits under such securities, assets or properties shall terminate prior to
the time that the Holder may elect to convert this Note into shares of Common
Stock, such amount of securities, assets or properties that the Holder would
have received had the Holder converted this Note immediately prior to the
distribution shall be distributed to the Holder on the date the securities,
assets or properties are distributed to the holders of Common Stock.

           (g) Adjustment for Reclassification, Exchange or Substitution. If the
Common Stock issuable upon the conversion hereof (and the Other Notes) shall be
changed into the same or a different number of shares of any class or classes of
stock, whether by capital reorganization, reclassification, or otherwise (other
than a subdivision or combination of shares, stock dividend or reorganization,
reclassification, merger, consolidation or asset sale provided


                                      104

<PAGE>

for elsewhere in this Section 8), then and in each such event the Holder shall
have the right thereafter to convert this Note into the kind and amount of
shares of stock and other securities and property receivable upon such
reorganization, reclassification, or other change, by holders of the number of
shares of Common Stock into which this Note and all the Other Notes might have
been converted immediately prior to such reorganization, reclassification, or
change, all subject to further adjustment as provided herein or with respect to
such other securities or property by the terms thereof.

           (h) Reorganizations, Mergers, Consolidations or Asset Sales. If at
any time after the Issue Date there is a tender offer, exchange offer, merger,
consolidation, recapitalization, sale of all or substantially all of the
Company's assets or reorganization involving the Common Stock (collectively, a
"Capital Reorganization") (other than a merger, consolidation, sale of assets,
recapitalization, subdivision, combination, reclassification, exchange or
substitution of shares provided for elsewhere in this Section 8), as part of
such Capital Reorganization, provision shall be made so that the Holder and the
holders of the Other Notes (whether then outstanding or thereafter issued) will
thereafter be entitled to receive upon conversion of this Note and the Other
Notes the number of shares of stock or other securities or property of the
Company to which a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock deliverable
upon conversion would have been entitled on such Capital Reorganization, subject
to adjustment in respect to such stock or securities by the terms thereof. In
any such case, appropriate adjustment will be made in the application of the
provisions of this Section 8(h) with respect to the rights of the Holder and the
holders of the Other Notes after the Capital Reorganization to the end that the
provisions of this Section 8(h) (including adjustment of the Conversion Price
then in effect and the number of shares issuable upon conversion of this Note
and the Other Notes) will be applicable after that event and be as nearly
equivalent as practicable. In the event that the Company is not the surviving
entity of any such Capital Reorganization, this Note (and each Other Note) shall
become notes of such surviving entity, with the same powers, rights and
preferences as provided herein.

           (i) Adjustment for Sale of Shares. If at any time after the Issue
Date, the Company issues or sells any shares of its Common Stock or any
securities or other instruments convertible into or exercisable for shares of
Common Stock (other than (1) Common Stock issuable or issued upon conversion or
exercise of securities outstanding prior to the Issue Date, (2) options to
purchase Common Stock granted to directors, employees or consultants of the
Company and its affiliates, and Common Stock issuable or issued to such persons
thereunder or under any stock purchase or similar arrangement, (3) Common Stock
issued after the Issue Date as consideration in an acquisition of a business,
assets or a legal entity that is approved by the Company's board of directors
and (4) rights issued pursuant to a rights agreement or stockholder rights plan
approved by the Company's board of directors and Common Stock issuable or issued
upon exercise thereof or in exchange therefor (collectively, the "Excluded
Stock")), for a consideration per share less than the Signing Stock Price (as
defined in the Purchase Agreement, as adjusted to take into account subsequent
increases or decreases in the outstanding shares of Common Stock pursuant to
subdivisions, combinations or distributions of Common Stock), then and in each
such case, the Conversion Price then in effect will be reduced to a price
(calculated to the nearest cent) determined by multiplying such Conversion Price
by a fraction (1) the numerator of which will be the number of shares of Common
Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issue, plus the number of shares of
Common Stock which the aggregate


                                       105

<PAGE>

consideration received by the Company for such issue (plus the aggregate
consideration to be received by the Company upon the exercise thereof) would
purchase at the Closing Stock Price (as adjusted), and (2) the denominator of
which will be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after
the Common Stock proposed to be issued or sold is issued or sold (or into which
the securities so issued or sold are convertible or exercisable); provided that
such fraction will in no event be greater than one (1). For purposes of making
any adjustment in the Conversion Price as provided in this Section 8(i), the
consideration received by the Company for any issue or sale of Common Stock
shall be computed:

               (i) to the extent it consists of cash, as the amount of cash
received by the Company before deduction of any offering expenses payable by the
Company and any underwriting or similar commissions, compensation or concessions
paid or allowed by the Company in connection with such issue or sale;

               (ii) to the extent it consists of property other than cash, at
the fair market value of that property as determined in good faith by the
Company's board of directors;

               (iii) if Common Stock is issued or sold together with other
assets of the Company for a consideration which covers both, as the portion of
the consideration so received that may be determined in good faith by the
Company's board of directors to be allocable to such Common Stock;

               (iv) if any security convertible into or exercisable for shares
of Common Stock is involved in such transaction, then, in each case, the price
per share of Common Stock issuable on the exercise of the rights or options or
the conversion of the securities will be determined by dividing the total
amount, if any, received or receivable by the Company as consideration for the
granting of the rights or options or the issue or sale of the convertible
securities, plus the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration
payable to the Company on exercise or conversion of the securities, by the
maximum number of shares of Common Stock issuable on the exercise or conversion.
Such grant or issue or sale will be considered to be an issue or sale for cash
of the maximum number of shares of Common Stock issuable on exercise or
conversion at the per share price determined under this subsection, and the
Conversion Price will be adjusted as above provided to reflect (on the basis of
that determination) such issue or sale. No further adjustment of the Conversion
Price will be made as a result of the actual issuance of shares of Common Stock
on the exercise of any such rights or options or the conversion of any such
convertible securities. Upon the expiration or termination of any unexercised
right or option or unconverted convertible security, the Conversion Price shall
be adjusted immediately to reflect the applicable Conversion Price which would
have been in effect had such option, right or convertible security never been
issued. In the event of any change in the number of shares of Common Stock
issuable upon the exercise or conversion of any option, right or convertible
security, including but not limited to a change resulting from the anti-dilution
provisions thereof, the Conversion Price then in effect shall forthwith be
readjusted to such Conversion Price as would have been obtained had the
Conversion Price adjustment that was originally made upon the issuance of such
option, right or convertible security which were not exercised or converted
prior to such change been made upon the basis of such change, but no further
adjustment shall be made for the actual issuance of the Common Stock upon the
exercise or conversion of any such option, right or convertible security.

consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other
voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of
the terms to be observed or performed hereunder by the Company, but will at all
times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all the provisions of this
Section 8 and in the taking of all such action as may be necessary or
appropriate in order to protect the conversion rights of the Holder against

certificate setting forth such adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail
the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment are based and shall file a

reasonable written request of the Holder, furnish or cause to be furnished to
such holder a similar certificate setting forth (i) such adjustments and
readjustments, (ii) the Conversion Price then in effect, and (iii) the number of
shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other property which then
would be received upon the conversion hereof. Despite such adjustment or
readjustment, the form of this Note, if the same shall reflect the initial or
any subsequent Conversion Price, need not be changed in order for the
adjustments or readjustments to be valid in accordance with the provisions of
this Note, which shall control.

               (v) of the involuntary or voluntary dissolution, liquidation or

other provision herein, the Company shall not be required to issue upon

19.9% of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on the date prior to
the Issue Date and (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is (x) the aggregate
original principal amount of this Note and the denominator of which is (y) the

                  CONSIDERATION ADJUSTMENT COMPLETION ACCOUNTS

1.        If there is a dispute as to whether or not an adjustment is required

          incorporating a Statement of Working Capital Value are prepared as
          soon as practicable and, in any event within 20 Business Days. The

          be borne by the Buyer.

2.        The Completion Accounts shall be prepared on a basis which is
          consistent with the manner in, and the principles, bases and policies

          generally accepted accounting standards in England and Wales. The
          Buyer shall provide the Seller's Accountants with access to all
          documentation, information and data in or relating to the Company

3.        When draft Completion Accounts have been prepared, the Committee shall
          promptly deliver a copy of the draft Completion Accounts and Statement

          Completion Accounts to the Buyer, the parties shall procure that the
          Buyer's Accountant and the Seller's Accountants meet to review the
          draft Completion Accounts and to satisfy themselves that they have
          been duly prepared in accordance with this Agreement and that the
          Statement of Working Capital Value has been correctly stated. The
          Committee shall promptly provide, and render or cause the provision
          and rendering to the Buyer of such information and assistance as the
          Buyer may reasonably require for the purposes of agreeing the

          Buyer shall then, within 10 Business Days following such meeting
          either:-

          4.1       confirm in writing (a "Satisfaction Notice") to the
                    Committee that the Buyer agrees that the draft Completion

          4.2       give notice in writing (a "Dissatisfaction Notice") to the
                    Committee explaining in reasonable detail why they are
                    unable so to confirm.

5.        If the Buyer fails to give a Satisfaction Notice or a Dissatisfaction
          Notice when required, the draft Completion Audited Accounts and the
          Statement of Working Capital Value shall be deemed to have been
          finally accepted and agreed by the Sellers and the Buyer.

6.        If the Buyer gives a Dissatisfaction Notice the Buyer and Committee
          shall endeavour to resolve all matters in dispute as soon as is
          practicable.

7.        If the Buyer and Committee fail to resolve such matters within 10
          Business Days of the date of the giving of the Dissatisfaction Notice
          (the "Resolution Period") either the Buyer or the Committee may refer
          all matters in dispute for resolution to an

                                       125

          shall be appointed by the President for the time being of the
          Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales within five

          application of either the Buyer or the Seller.

9.        The Accountant shall be instructed to determine the dispute in
          accordance with the provisions of this Schedule 15 and to make such
          determination as soon as is practicable and, in any event, within 20
          Business Days of his being instructed. In making such determination
          the Accountant shall act as an expert and not as an arbitrator and his
          decision shall (in the absence of manifest error) be final and binding
          on the parties.

10.       The costs of the Accountant shall be borne by the parties in the
          proportions the Accountant may direct or, in the absence of direction,
          as to one half by the Buyer and as to the other half by the Sellers.

11.       If, there is an Adjustment of (pound)75,000 or greater the Buyer will
          have the right to reduce the amount of such of the Deferred
          Consideration and/or the Promissory Notes by (pound)1 for every
          (pound)1 in excess of the said (pound)75,000 as it may in its absolute
          discretion determine by an amount equal to the Adjustment and to
          recover the balance against the Sellers.

12.       The Working Capital Value will be the amount of Current Assets less
          Current Liabilities based on the figures for such items in the
          Completion Accounts.

          For these purposes "Current Assets" and "Current Liabilities" will be
          determined in the Completion Accounts on the basis as previously set
          out in the Audited Accounts.

8.        if there is a vacancy in the members of the Committee the vacancy need
          not be filled if the remaining members of the Committee so agree,

          that there was some defect in the appointment of any member of the
          Committee or person so acting or that they or any of them were
          disqualified or had vacated office, be as valid and effectual as if

          provisions of this Agreement to take any action or make any decision
          the Committee shall be obliged to take such action or make such
          decision. Unless otherwise agreed by the Committee all decisions will
          be made by a majority vote;

11.       any change to the members of the Committee shall be notified to the
          Buyer within 3 Business Days of such change; and

12.       notices to be served on Sellers will be valid if served on the

           THE UNITED STATES SECURITIES ACT REPRESENTATIONS BY SELLERS

1.        Each Seller understands that an investment in the Euronet Shares and
          Promissory Notes involves substantial risk. Each Seller severally
          represents and warrants to the Buyer that it:-

1.1       has, or its advising affiliate has, such knowledge and experience in
          financial and business matters as is necessary in order to evaluate
          the merits and risks of an investment in the Euronet Shares and
          Promissory Notes and protecting its own interests in connection with
          such Euronet Shares and Promissory Notes;

1.2       acknowledges that it can bear the economic risk of an investment in
          the Euronet Shares and Promissory Notes; and

1.3       has read and understood a private placement memorandum of the Buyer
          circulated by e-mail on 14 February 2003.

2.        Each Seller severally represents and warrants to the Buyer that the
          Euronet Shares and Promissory Notes to be acquired by the Seller
          hereunder will be acquired for investment purposes for the Seller's
          own account, not as a nominee or agent, and not with a view to the
          public resale or other distribution thereof within the meaning of the
          United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities
          Act"), and the Seller has no present intention of selling, granting
          any participation in, or otherwise distributing the Euronet Shares or
          Promissory Notes.

3.        Each Seller severally acknowledges that the Buyer has answered all
          inquiries that the Seller has made concerning the Buyer and its
          activities and all other matters relating to the operations of the
          Buyer and the Euronet Shares and Promissory Notes.

4.        Other than any information provided pursuant to paragraph 3 above and
          the Warranties of the Buyer under this Agreement, the Sellers are not
          relying on any other information, oral or written, that they may have
          received relating to the Buyer or the Euronet Shares or Promissory
          Notes.

5.        Each Seller severally acknowledges that the Euronet Shares have not
          been registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered or
          sold within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of,
          US persons except in accordance with Regulation S under the Securities
          Act ("Regulation S") or pursuant to an exemption from the registration
          requirements of the Securities Act. Each Seller represents and agrees
          that, with respect to offers and sales outside the United States, it
          will offer and sell the Euronet Shares only in accordance with Rule
          903 under the Securities Act.

6.        Each Seller severally agrees that each Promissory Note will contain a
          legend substantially to the following effect:

                    THIS NOTE HAS NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE UNITED STATES
                    SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE "1933 ACT"), OR
                    APPLICABLE STATE OR FOREIGN SECURITIES LAWS.

                    THIS NOTE IS SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER PURSUANT TO

                    ENTIRE ISSUED SHARE CAPITAL OF E-PAY LIMITED, DATED FEBRUARY
                    __, 2003, AND MAY NOT BE OFFERED, SOLD, PLEDGED OR OTHERWISE
                    TRANSFERRED BY THE HOLDER HEREOF.

7.        Each Seller severally agrees that each Euronet Share will contain a
          legend substantially to the following effect:

                    THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE ARE SUBJECT TO
                    RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER PURSUANT TO THAT CERTAIN AGREEMENT
                    FOR THE SALE AND PURCHASE OF THE ENTIRE ISSUED SHARE CAPITAL
                    OF E-PAY LIMITED, DATED FEBRUARY __, 2003, AND MAY NOT BE
                    OFFERED, SOLD, PLEDGED OR OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED FOR A PERIOD
                    OF ONE YEAR EXPIRING ON ___________, 2004 (THE "RESTRICTED
                    PERIOD").

                    THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN
                    REGISTERED UNDER THE UNITED STATES SECURITIES ACT OF 1933,
                    AS AMENDED (THE "1933 ACT"), OR APPLICABLE STATE OR FOREIGN
                    SECURITIES LAWS. UPON THE EXPIRATION OF THE RESTRICTED
                    PERIOD, THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE MAY BE
                    OFFERED, SOLD, PLEDGED OR OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED ONLY IF
                    REGISTERED UNDER THE 1933 ACT AND APPLICABLE STATE AND
                    FOREIGN SECURITIES LAWS OR IF THE HOLDER PROVIDES THE
                    COMPANY WITH AN OPINION FROM COUNSEL ACCEPTABLE TO THE
                    COMPANY STATING THAT AN EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION IS
                    AVAILABLE AT THE TIME OF SUCH TRANSFER. HEDGING TRANSACTIONS
                    INVOLVING THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE MAY NOT
                    BE CONDUCTED UNLESS IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE 1933 ACT AND ALL
                    APPLICABLE STATE AND FOREIGN SECURITIES LAWS.

8.        Notwithstanding the foregoing Paragraphs 6 and 7, Buyer agrees that
          the legends contemplated thereby shall be removed, and Buyer shall
          instruct its transfer agent to reissue certificates for such
          securities without such legends, as applicable, upon expiration of the
          transfer restrictions contemplated by this Agreement or in connection
          with a transfer of such securities in accordance with the Registration
          Statement or other transaction exempt from the registration
          requirements of the Securities Act after which transaction such legend
          is no longer required, in the reasonable opinion of counsel to Buyer,
          to establish Buyer's compliance with any provision of the Securities
          Act. In addition, from and after the effective date of the
          Registration Statement, Buyer shall cause its transfer agent to
          promptly reissue certificates for such securities without such legends
          from time to time at the request of Sellers and any Sellers' permitted
          transferees.

9.        Each Seller severally agrees that it and each of its affiliates,
          except as permitted under the Registration Statement or otherwise
          under the Securities Act, will not offer or sell the Euronet Shares in
          the United States by means of any form of general solicitation or
          general advertising within the meaning of Rule 502(c) under the

          general solicitation or general advertising.

10.       Each of the Sellers severally represents and agrees that it
          understands that no action has been taken or will be taken (except as
          contemplated by Schedule 11 of this Agreement with respect to the
          Registrable Shares) in any jurisdiction by the Buyer that would permit
          a public offering of the Euronet Shares and Promissory Notes, or
          possession or distribution of any offering or publicity material
          related to the Euronet Shares and Promissory Notes in any country or
          jurisdiction where action for that purpose is required and such Seller
          has complied and will comply with all applicable laws and regulations
          in each jurisdiction in which it acquires, offers, sells or delivers
          Euronet Shares and Promissory Notes or has in its possession or
          distributes any such offering or publicity material.
