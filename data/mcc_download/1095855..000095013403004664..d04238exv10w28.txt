            6.8 Headings. The headings in this Agreement are for convenience of
reference only and shall not limit or otherwise affect the meaning of terms
contained herein.

            6.9 Remedies.

                  (a) The parties hereto hereby acknowledge that the provisions
of Section 5 are reasonable and necessary for the protection of the Company. In
addition, the Executive further acknowledges that the Company will be
irrevocably damaged if such covenants are not specifically enforced.
Accordingly, the Executive agrees that, in addition to any other relief to which
the Company may be entitled, the Company will be entitled to seek and obtain
injunctive relief (without the requirement of any bond) from a court of
competent jurisdiction for the purposes of restraining the Executive from any
actual or threatened breach of such covenants. In addition, without limiting the
Company's remedies for any breach of any restriction on the Executive set forth
in Section 5, except as required by law, the Executive shall not be entitled to
any payments set forth in Section 4 hereof if the Executive breaches any of the
covenants applicable to the Executive contained in Section 5, the Executive will
immediately return to the Company any such payments previously received under
Section 4.5 upon such a breach, and, in the event of such breach, the Company
will have no obligation to pay any of the amounts that remain payable by the
Company under Section 4.

                  (b) The Executive acknowledges and agrees that a material
breach of this Agreement shall constitute "Cause". The Company acknowledges and
agrees that a material breach of this Agreement shall constitute "Good Reason."

            6.10 Tax Gross-Up. In the event that any payment made to the
Executive pursuant to this Agreement with the Company becomes subject to excise
taxes under Section 4999 of the Code, the Company will pay to the Executive the
amount of such excise taxes plus all federal, state and local taxes applicable
to the Company's payment of such excise taxes including any additional excise
taxes under Section 4999 of the Code with respect to payments made pursuant to
this Agreement.

            6.11 Severability. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement, or any part thereof, is held by a court of competent
jurisdiction of any foreign, federal, state, county or local government or any
other governmental, regulatory or administrative agency or authority to be
invalid, void, unenforceable or against public

policy for any reason, the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and
restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall
in no way be affected or impaired or invalidated. The Executive acknowledges
that the restrictive covenants contained in Section 5 are a condition of this
Agreement and are reasonable and valid in geographical and temporal scope and in
all other respects.

            6.12 Judicial Modification. If any court or arbitrator determines
that any of the covenants in Section 5, or any part of any of them, is invalid
or unenforceable, the remainder of such covenants and parts thereof shall not
thereby be affected and shall be given full effect, without regard to the
invalid portion. If any court or arbitrator determines that any of such
covenants, or any part thereof; is invalid or unenforceable because of the
geographic or temporal scope of such provision, such court or arbitrator shall
reduce such scope to the minimum extent necessary to make such covenants valid
and enforceable.

            6.13 Attorney Fees. The prevailing party in any litigation between
the Company and the Executive with respect to this Agreement shall be entitled
to an award of the reasonable legal fees and disbursements incurred by such
party with respect to third party claims.

            IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto, intending to be legally
bound hereby, have executed this Agreement as of the day and year first above
mentioned.
