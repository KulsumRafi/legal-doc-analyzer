            WHEREAS, the Company desires to have SPS furnish certain management

            NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound

more fully described and defined below, as may be necessary or desirable or as
may be reasonably requested or required, in connection with the business,
operations and affairs, both ordinary and extraordinary, of the Company and its
subsidiaries and affiliates. "Services" means and includes, without limitation,
the furnishing of office space, advice, assistance and guidance, and personnel
to implement the same, in connection with, among others, executive,
administrative, financial, managerial, operation, supervisory and related
matters, including without limitation those matters set forth on Exhibit A

Executive Officer of the Company and (b) such other suitable officer and
employee of SPS to serve as Chief Financial Officer of the Company or such other
executive position as SPS may provide from time to time.

            In performing services, SPS shall be subject to the supervision and
control of the board of directors of the Company. In no event shall SPS incur an
obligation or enter into any transaction on behalf of the Company involving in
excess of $100,000 without the prior approval of the board of directors of the
Company.

            1.02 While the amount of time and personnel required for performance
by SPS hereunder will necessarily vary depending upon the nature and type of
services, SPS shall devote such time and effort and make available such
personnel as may from time to time reasonably be required for the performance of
Services hereunder.
