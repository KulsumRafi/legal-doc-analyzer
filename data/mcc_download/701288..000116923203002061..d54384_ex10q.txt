THIS FIRST AMENDEMENT TO EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT ("First Amendment"), dated as of
the 3rd day of December, 2002, by and between Atrion Corporation, a Delaware

WHEREAS, the Company and the Executive desire to amend certain provisions of the
Employment Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual covenants
hereinafter set forth, the parties hereby agree as follows:

1. The first paragraph of Section 3(a) of the Employment Agreement is deleted in
its entirety and the following is substituted in lieu and instead thereof:

      "(a) Base Salary and Bonuses. The Company shall pay the Executive a base
      salary (the "Base Salary") of Five Hundred Thousand and no/100 Dollars
      ($500,000.00) for each calendar year in the Employment Term."

2. The second paragraph of Section 3(a) of the Employment Agreement is amended
by deleting the phrase "fifty percent (50%) of the Base Salary for such calendar
year" and substituting in lieu and instead thereof the following:

      "Two Hundred Fifty Thousand and no/100 Dollars ($250,000.00) for calendar
      year 2002 and One Hundred Thousand and no/100 Dollars ($100,000.00) for
      each calendar year in the Employment Term after 2002."

3. This First Amendment may be executed in counterparts and by facsimile, each
of which when so executed shall be deemed to be an original, and such
counterparts shall together constitute and be one and the same instrument.

4. As hereby amended, the Employment Agreement remains in full force and effect.
