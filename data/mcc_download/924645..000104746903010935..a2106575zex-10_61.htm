equal to that payable upon the exercise of this Warrant, the kind and amount of
shares of stock and other securities and property receivable in connection with
such reclassification, reorganization, or change by a holder of the same number
of Shares as were purchasable by the holder of this Warrant immediately prior
to such reclassification, reorganization, or change.&#160; In any such case appropriate provisions shall be made with
respect to the rights and interest of the holder of this Warrant so that the
provisions hereof shall thereafter be applicable with respect to any shares of
stock or other securities and property deliverable upon exercise hereof, and
appropriate adjustments shall be made to the purchase price per share payable
hereunder, provided the aggregate purchase price shall remain the same.</font></p>

therefore bear the economic risk of such investment indefinitely, unless a

such registration.&#160; The Holder further
understands that the Warrant Shares have not been qualified under the
California Securities Law of&nbsp;1968 (the &#147;<u>California Law</u>&#148;) by reason
