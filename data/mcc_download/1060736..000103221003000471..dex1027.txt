   3.6   Inspection, Rejection of Shipment

         3.6.1  SEATTLE GENETICS shall conduct release testing on quality
                control samples obtained from each Batch of Product shipped by
                Gensia Sicor hereunder to confirm that such quality control
                samples conform to the Manufacturing Standards. SEATTLE GENETICS
                shall authorize the release of each Batch for shipment by the
                later of: (a) [***] ([***]) [***] after SEATTLE GENETICS'
                receipt of the quality control samples for such Batch; or (b)
                [***] ([***]) [***] after SEATTLE GENETICS' receipt of the Batch
                Record for such Batch. If any of SEATTLE GENETICS' internal
                assays reveal that a quality control sample does not conform to
                the Manufacturing Standards, SEATTLE GENETICS may, in its sole
                discretion, by written notice to Gensia Sicor (a "Notice of
                Rejection/Nonconformance") either (a) reject the Batch or (b)
                initiate an investigation into the reasons for the failure to
                conform to the Manufacturing Standards, during which
                investigation the time periods set forth in this Section 3.6.1
                shall be extended until both parties mutually agree on the cause
                of the nonconformance.

         3.6.2  SEATTLE GENETICS shall be deemed to have accepted delivery of
                Batch of Product if no Notice of Rejection/Nonconformance is
                received by Gensia Sicor in accordance with the procedure and
                time frame described in Section 3.6.1.

         3.6.3  Gensia Sicor shall have the right to sample and retest Product
                or to have an outside laboratory sample and retest Product if
                SEATTLE GENETICS claims that such Product does not conform to
                the Manufacturing Standards. Disputes between the parties as to
                whether any Product rejected by SEATTLE GENETICS conforms to the
                Manufacturing Standards shall be resolved by a mutually
                acceptable third party testing laboratory.

         3.6.4  Gensia Sicor shall assume no liability for product that fails to
                conform with the Manufacturing Standards if the Product: (i) has
                been subjected to misuse, negligence or accident other than by
                Gensia Sicor or any employee or agent of Gensia Sicor; (ii) has
                been stored, handled or used by others in a manner contrary to
                cGMP after delivery to a common carrier; or (iii) nonconformance
                is attributable to processes, procedures or Product components
                specified by SEATTLE GENETICS in the Master Batch Record where
                such processes, procedures or Product components were followed
                or used by Gensia Sicor in accordance with the Master Batch
                Record.

   3.7   Obsolete Components. SEATTLE GENETICS shall reimburse Gensia Sicor for
         the actual cost of any obsolete Excipients, Primary Components,
         Shipping Components, and Secondary Packaging, (plus any related special
         disposal

         costs) purchased by Gensia Sicor expressly to meet its performance
         obligations under this Agreement in reliance upon SEATTLE GENETICS'
         then most recent Forecast. For the purposes of this Section 3.7, an
         obsolete component is any Excipient, Primary Component, Secondary
         Packaging, or Shipping Component which cannot be incorporated into the
         Product due to changes directed by SEATTLE GENETICS or mandated by a
         regulatory authority, or caused by a cancellation or postponement of
         manufacturing, and which cannot be reused by Gensia Sicor for another
         product manufactured for a third party. Once a Component becomes
         obsolete, Gensia Sicor may invoice SEATTLE GENETICS for the acquisition
         cost of such obsolete components, which invoice shall identify the
         Excipients or Components in question and shall be accompanied by a
         reasonably detailed statement of the cause of such obsolescence.

   3.8   Risk of Loss. Risk of loss of APIs, in-process and finished Product
         held by Gensia Sicor on its premises and in its care, custody and
         control, shall be with Gensia Sicor until [***]. Notwithstanding the
         foregoing, Gensia Sicor shall not be liable for loss of APIs,
         in-process or finished Product when Gensia Sicor is conducting
         manufacturing operations in accordance with Gensia Sicor's SOPs, cGMP,
         the Manufacturing Standards and the Master Batch Record.

         (a)    In the event of a failed Batch, Gensia Sicor shall be liable to
                SEATTLE GENETICS to the extent that the cause of such a failure
                is attributable to the negligence or willful conduct of Gensia
                Sicor. In that case, Gensia Sicor shall, as SEATTLE GENETICS's
                sole and exclusive remedy for the failed Batch, [***] and
                SEATTLE GENETICS may choose, at its sole discretion, one of the
                following two options:

         Option 1:
                Gensia Sicor will pay SEATTLE GENETICS an amount equal to the
                [***] of (i) the [***] or (ii) the [***], in each case offset by
                the amount, if any, that such failure is attributable to the
                negligence or willful conduct of SEATTLE GENETICS.

         Option 2:
                Gensia Sicor will use commercially reasonable efforts to
                remanufacture the Batch as soon as practical, and apply a credit
                to the invoice for the replacement Batch in an amount that is
                the [***] of (i) the [***] or (ii) the [***], in each case
                offset by the amount, if any, that such failure is attributable
                to the negligence or willful conduct of SEATTLE GENETICS.

         (b)    In the event that a batch of Compounded Bulk is found not to
                conform with the bulk release specification set forth in the
                Manufacturing Standards prior to initiation of the fill, Gensia
                Sicor, upon explicit instructions provided by SEATTLE GENETICS,
                shall initiate one or more remedial steps in an attempt to bring
                the Compounded Bulk into specification. Should these remedial
                steps fail to bring the Compounded Bulk into specification
                SEATTLE GENETICS may direct GENSIA SICOR to terminate the
                manufacturing process at this stage. In the event the
                manufacturing process is terminated prior to fill, Gensia Sicor
                shall invoice SEATTLE GENETICS for [***] if the [***]. If the
                [***] shall be submitted to SEATTLE GENETICS.

         (c)    In the event of loss of APIs prior to the start of the
                manufacturing process Gensia Sicor shall be liable to SEATTLE
                GENETICS [***]. In that case, Gensia Sicor shall, as SEATTLE
                GENETICS' sole and exclusive remedy for the lost APIs, pay to
                SEATTLE GENETICS an amount that is the [***] of (i) the [***] or
                (ii) the [***], in each case offset by the amount, if any, that
                such failure is attributable to the negligence of willful
                conduct of SEATTLE GENETICS.

   3.9   Exceptions. Gensia Sicor shall not be liable for loss of APIs,
         formulated bulk, WIP, or Product; (i) resulting from an event of force
         majeure pursuant to Section 9.2; (ii) caused by SEATTLE GENETICS'
         negligence or willful misconduct; or (iii) occurring while Gensia Sicor
         is actually conducting manufacturing operations in accordance with
         Gensia Sicor's SOPs, cGMP, the Manufacturing Standards and the Master
         Batch Record.

                plant in Irvine, California in accordance with the instructions
                on the applicable Purchase Order and the terms of this
                Agreement. A Certificate of Analysis shall accompany each Batch
                of Product shipped. In no event shall Gensia Sicor be required
                to ship any Batch prior to the SEATTLE GENETICS Batch Release
                date.

         4.2.2  Delivery of the Product by Gensia Sicor to SEATTLE GENETICS
                shall be deemed to have taken place upon delivery at the
                Facility to the common carrier designated by SEATTLE GENETICS in
                the applicable Purchase Order (or, if none, a common carrier
                reasonably selected by Gensia Sicor and approved in writing by
                SEATTLE GENETICS). Gensia Sicor will not be liable for loss or
                damage to the Product resulting from [***].

         4.2.3  All shipping costs related to the distribution of finished
                dosage Product to a designated recipient, including but not
                limited to all actual freight costs, taxes, duties, import or
                export fees, transport fees, shipping documentation, will be the

                invoiced upon occurrence.

   4.3   Shipment Under Quarantine. At SEATTLE GENETICS' discretion and with
         Gensia Sicor's consent, SEATTLE GENETICS may authorize a shipment of

         under quarantine. If the Product fails testing, due to the fault of
         Gensia Sicor, the cost of shipping the Product back to Gensia Sicor
         shall be borne by Gensia Sicor. If the Product fails testing due to the
         fault of SEATTLE GENETICS, the cost of shipping the Product back to
         Gensia Sicor shall be borne by SEATTLE GENETICS.

   4.4   Storage.

         4.4.1  Storage of API. At any one time Gensia Sicor will store API, in
                quantities not to exceed that sufficient for the manufacture of
                two forecasted Batches, at no charge, subject to increase upon
                mutual agreement of the parties.

         4.4.2  Storage of Finished Product. Gensia Sicor will store the Product
                at no charge for up to [***] ([***]) [***] following SEATTLE
                GENETICS' Batch Release. In the event that SEATTLE GENETICS
                requires a delay in shipment of finished Product and SEATTLE
                GENETICS communicates such change in writing prior to Gensia
                Sicor Batch Release, Gensia Sicor will either disposition the
                Product to a SEATTLE GENETICS specified public pharmaceutical
                warehouse or, as space permits, store the finished Product and
                invoice SEATTLE GENETICS for the Batch(s). In the event that
                Gensia Sicor stores Product for more than [***] ([***]) [***]
                following SEATTLE GENETICS Batch Release, Gensia Sicor shall
                charge SEATTLE GENETICS according to the rates set forth on
                Exhibit B.

   4.5   Payment.

         4.5.1  Gensia Sicor shall invoice SEATTLE GENETICS upon the later of:
                (i) Gensia Sicor's issuance of a Batch Record to SEATTLE
                GENETICS with respect to a Batch, or (ii) SEATTLE GENETICS'
                acceptance of such Batch. Except as otherwise provided in this
                Agreement, all invoices shall be due and payable net [***]
                ([***]) [***] from the date of the invoice. A late payment
                service charge of [***] per month (or the highest amount
                permitted by law, if lower than [***]) shall be paid on all
                amounts that are past due more than [***] ([***]) [***] from the
                date of invoice.

         4.5.2  SEATTLE GENETICS shall pay Gensia Sicor the invoiced amount for
                Batch Processing Charges of each conforming Batch of Product
                pursuant to Exhibit B hereto. In addition, SEATTLE GENETICS
                shall pay Gensia Sicor for any other services rendered (as

                the performance of such party's obligations hereunder and

              to the extent that the alleged infringement arose out of or
              related to Gensia Sicor's use of processes, compounds or other
              products the rights to which are claimed to be owned by SEATTLE
              GENETICS.

      7.4     Notice and Assistance. No indemnity under this Article VII shall

              to participate at its expense through counsel of its own choosing)

              necessary in defending against such claim, suit, or action. No
              party shall be required to pay over to another amounts called for

                                 CONFIDENTIALITY

      8.1     Generally. Each Party acknowledges that the Disclosing Party is in
              possession of Confidential Information relating to its products
              and technologies and such Confidential Information is the
              exclusive and confidential property of the Disclosing Party; and,
              except as otherwise expressly set forth herein, the Recipient
              shall have no rights or claims to such property. Confidential
              Information of the Disclosing Party shall be held in confidence by
              the Recipient and not disclosed to any person other than employees
              of the Recipient or its Affiliates or contractors or consultants
              retained by the Recipient or its Affiliates, in each case who are
              bound by duties of confidentiality substantially similar to those
              set forth in this Article VIII, except upon prior written consent,
              and shall not be used by the Recipient for any purpose except for
              development and manufacture of Seattle Genetics' products. The
              Receiving Party shall use the strictest standard of care that is
              practical to ensure that such employees, contractors and
              consultants do not disclose or make any unauthorized use of
              Confidential Information. The Receiving Party shall promptly
              notify the Disclosing Party upon discovery of any unauthorized use
              or disclosure of the Confidential Information. Confidential
              Information shall not include, and the obligations of
              confidentiality and use shall not apply to, disclosed information
              that:

                  (i)    is or becomes publicly available through no fault of
                         the Recipient or its individual employees, agents or
                         members amounting to a breach hereof;

                  (ii)   is lawfully obtained on a non-confidential basis by the
                         Recipient from a third party who is not obligated to
                         retain such information in confidence

                 (iii)   the Recipient can demonstrate, by competent evidence,
                         was known to it or any of its Affiliates without a duty
                         of nondisclosure from a source other than the
                         Disclosing Party or any of its Affiliates prior to the
                         disclosure hereunder.

                 (iv)    the Recipient can demonstrate by its written records is
                         independently developed by employees of the Recipient
                         or an Affiliate of the Recipient, which employees were
                         neither privy to nor had access to the Confidential
                         Information and which is developed without use in any
                         way of the Confidential Information

                  (v)    must be disclosed to governmental agencies, provided
                         that: 1) this exception shall only apply to disclosure
                         to such agencies, and not to any other person or
                         entity; and 2) the disclosing Party (a) shall provide
                         the other Party with prompt notice (including copies of
                         all written requests or demands) of any proposed
                         disclosure to any governmental agency, with an
                         explanation of the Confidential Information of the
                         other Party to be disclosed; and (b) shall cooperate in
                         any lawful effort by the other Party to prevent, limit
                         or restrict disclosure of its Confidential Information
                         to such government agency.

      8.2     Termination. Within [***] ([***]) [***] following the termination
              of any agreement between the Parties hereto with respect to the
              subject matter Recipient agrees to promptly return all tangible
              items relating to the Confidential Information, including all
              written material, photographs, models, compounds, compositions and
              the like made available or supplied by the Disclosing Party to
              Recipient, and all copies thereof, upon the request of the
              Disclosing Party. Recipient further agrees to identify those
              persons to whom the Confidential Information that is the subject
              of this Agreement was disclosed upon request of the Disclosing
              Party.
