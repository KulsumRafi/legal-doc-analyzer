                  (or, if necessary to effectuate the purposes hereof, to
                  Lenders who are not Tranche B Lenders) upon the Termination
                  Date in such amounts as are necessary to effect such
                  allocation. All such payments shall be made to the Agent or
                  the Tranche B Agent, as the case may be, for the account of
                  the Person to be paid.

                           (i) So long as the Borrower maintains an Investment
                  Grade Rating, in addition to borrowings of Tranche B Revolving
                  Loans, at any time during the period from the Termination Date
                  to, but excluding, the Tranche B Termination Date the Borrower
                  may, as set forth in this Section 2.17.(b), request the
                  Tranche B Lenders to make offers to make Tranche B Bid Rate
                  Loans to the Borrower in Dollars. The Tranche B Lenders may,
                  but shall have no obligation to, make such offers and the
                  Borrower may, but shall have no obligation to, accept any such
                  offers in the manner set forth in this Section 2.17.(b).
                  Except for the purpose and to the extent expressly stated in
                  Section 2.12., the amount of any Tranche B Bid Rate Loan made
                  by any Tranche B Lender shall not constitute a utilization of
                  such Tranche B Lender's Tranche B Commitment.

                           (ii) The requests for, quotes for, notices relating

                  Loans, shall be in accordance with the provisions of Sections

                           (i) Subject to the terms and conditions hereof,
                  during the period from the Termination Date to but excluding
                  the Tranche B Termination Date, the Swingline Lender agrees to
                  make Tranche B Swingline Loans to the Borrower in an aggregate
                  principal amount at any one time outstanding up to, but not
                  exceeding, the amount of the Tranche B Swingline Commitment.
                  If at any time the aggregate principal amount of the Tranche B
                  Swingline Loans outstanding at such time exceeds the Tranche B
                  Swingline Commitment in effect at such time, the Borrower
                  shall immediately pay the Tranche B Agent for the account of
                  the Swingline Lender the amount of such excess. Subject to the
                  terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Borrower may
                  borrow, repay and reborrow Tranche B Swingline Loans

         current Tranche B Termination Date by one (1) year by executing and
         delivering to the Tranche B Agent no later than January 30, 2005, a
         written request substantially in the form of Exhibit M (with
         appropriate changes relating to the Tranche B Loans). Once given, such
         cancellation request shall be irrevocable by, and binding on, the
         Borrower. The Tranche B Agent shall forward to each Tranche B Lender a
         copy of such cancellation request delivered to the Tranche B Agent
         promptly after receipt thereof. If the Borrower fails to deliver a
         cancellation request to the Tranche B Agent by such date, then the
         Tranche B Termination Date shall remain unchanged. If the Tranche B
         Termination Date is not so shortened, the Borrower agrees to pay to the
         Tranche B Agent, on or before January 30, 2005, for the account of each
         Tranche B Lender a fee equal to one-quarter of one percent (0.25%) of
         the amount of such Tranche B Lender's Tranche B Commitment (whether or
         not utilized).

                  (g) AMOUNT LIMITATIONS. Notwithstanding any other term of this
         Agreement or any other Loan Document, at no time after the Termination
         Date may:

                           (i) The aggregate principal amount of all outstanding
                  Tranche B Revolving Loans, together with the aggregate
                  principal amount of all outstanding Tranche B Bid Rate Loans
                  and the aggregate principal amount of all outstanding Tranche
                  B Swingline Loans and the aggregate amount of all Letter of
                  Credit Liabilities, exceed the aggregate amount of the Tranche
                  B Commitments at such time; or

                           (ii) The aggregate principal amount of all
                  outstanding Tranche B Bid Rate Loans exceed the lesser of (i)
                  $200,000,000 or (ii) 50% of the aggregate amount of the
                  Tranche B Commitments at such time.

                  (h) INCREASE OF TRANCHE B COMMITMENTS. The Borrower shall have
         the right to request increases in the aggregate amount of the Tranche B
         Commitments (PROVIDED that after giving effect to the aggregate amount
         of increases in the Tranche B Commitments pursuant to this Section, the
         aggregate amount of Tranche B Commitments shall not exceed
         $625,000,000) by providing written notice to the Tranche B Agent, which
         notice shall be irrevocable once given. Each such increase in the
         Tranche B Commitments must be an aggregate minimum amount of
         $20,000,000 and integral multiples of $1,000,000 in excess thereof. The
         Tranche B Agent shall promptly notify each Tranche B Lender of any such
         request. Each existing Tranche B Lender shall have the right to
         increase its Tranche B Commitment by an amount so that such Tranche B
         Lender's Tranche B Commitment Percentage shall not be decreased as a
         result of such requested increase in the Tranche B Commitments. Each
         Tranche B Lender shall notify the Tranche B Agent within 10 Business
         Days after receipt of the Tranche B Agent's notice whether such Lender
         wishes to increase the amount of its Tranche B Commitment. If a Tranche
         B Lender fails to deliver any such notice to the Tranche B Agent within
         such time period, then such Tranche B Lender shall be deemed to have
         declined to increase its Tranche B Commitment. No Tranche B Lender
         shall be required to increase its Tranche B Commitment and any new
         Tranche B Lender(s) becoming a party to this


                                      -6-


<PAGE>


         Agreement in connection with any such requested increase must be an
         Eligible Assignee. In the event a new Tranche B Lender or Tranche B
         Lenders become a party to this Agreement, or if any existing Tranche B
         Lender agrees to increase its Tranche B Commitment, such Tranche B
         Lender shall on the date it becomes a Tranche B Lender hereunder (or
         increases its Tranche B Commitment, in the case of an existing Tranche
         B Lender) (and as a condition thereto) purchase from the other Tranche
         B Lenders its Tranche B Commitment Percentage (as determined after
         giving effect to the increase of Tranche B Commitments) of any
         outstanding Tranche B Revolving Loans, by making available to the
         Tranche B Agent for the account of such other Tranche B Lenders at the
         Principal Office, in same day funds, an amount equal to the sum of (A)
         the portion of the outstanding principal amount of such Tranche B
         Revolving Loans to be purchased by such Tranche B Lender plus (B) the
         aggregate amount of payments previously made by the other Tranche B
         Lenders under Section 2.4.(j) (as incorporated by Section 2.17.(d))
         which have not been repaid plus (C) interest accrued and unpaid to and
         as of such date on such portion of the outstanding principal amount of
         such Tranche B Revolving Loans. The Borrower shall pay to the Tranche
         B Lenders amounts payable, if any, to such Tranche B Lenders under
         Section 4.4. as a result of the prepayment of any such Tranche B
         Revolving Loans. No increase of the Tranche B Commitments may be
         effected under this subsection if either (x) a Default or Event of
         Default shall be in existence on the effective date of such increase
         or (y) any representation or warranty made or deemed made by the
         Borrower or any other Loan Party in any Loan Document to which any
         such Loan Party is a party is not (or would not be) true or correct on
         the effective date of such increase (except for representations or
         warranties which expressly relate solely to an earlier date). In
         connection with any increase in the aggregate amount of the Tranche B
         Commitments pursuant to this subsection, (a) any Tranche B Lender
         becoming a party hereto shall execute such documents and agreements as
         the Tranche B Agent may reasonably request and (b) the Borrower shall
         make appropriate arrangements so that each new Tranche B Lender, and
         any existing Tranche B Lender increasing its Tranche B Commitment,
         receives a new or replacement Tranche B Note, as appropriate, in the
         amount of such Tranche B Lender's Tranche B Commitment within 2
         Business Days of the effectiveness of the applicable increase in the
         aggregate amount of Tranche B Commitments.

                  (i) APPLICATION OF AGREEMENT TO TRANCHE B LOANS. The
         provisions of Articles I., III. (except for Section 3.6.(c)) and IV.,
         Sections 5.2. and 5.3., Articles VI., VII., VIII., IX., X., XI. and
         XII. and defined terms used therein and in the Exhibits referenced
         therein shall be interpreted, where necessary, to give effect to the
         Tranche B Loans and Letters of Credit contemplated under this Section
         2.17. In the event that defined terms used in this Article II., to the
         extent applicable to Tranche B Loans, are inconsistent with the
         provisions of this Section 2.17., such terms shall be interpreted,
         where necessary, to give effect to such provisions.

         D. AMENDMENT TO SECTION 3.6. Section 3.6. of the Credit Agreement is
hereby amended to add the following subsection (e), which shall be inserted
immediately after subsection (d) thereof:

                  (e) TRANCHE B MATURITY FEE. If the Tranche B Termination Date
         is not shortened in accordance with Section 2.17.(f), the Borrower
         agrees to pay to the Tranche B Agent for the account of each Tranche B
         Lender a fee equal to one-quarter of one percent (0.25%) of the amount
         of such Tranche B Lender's Tranche B Commitment (whether or not
         utilized). Such fee shall be due and payable in full on January 30,
         2005.

         E. ADDITIONAL EXHIBITS. The Credit Agreement is hereby amended to add
Exhibits Q, R and S thereto, as set forth as Exhibits Q, R and S, respectively,

         F. WAIVER OF MATURITY FEE. Each Tranche B Lender hereby irrevocably
waives its right to receive payment of its share of the maturity fee otherwise
payable by the Borrower pursuant to Section 3.6.(c) of the Credit Agreement.

         G. RESTRICTION ON ASSIGNMENT. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in the Credit Agreement (including, but not limited to, Section 12.5.
thereof), or any of the other Loan Documents, any Lender which is also a Tranche
B Lender which effectuates an assignment under Section 12.5.(d) of the Credit
Agreement to an Assignee shall assign an equal percentage of both its Commitment
and its Tranche B Commitment to the applicable Assignee in connection with any
such assignment.


II.      REPRESENTATIONS.

                  The Borrower represents and warrants to the Agent and the
Lenders as follows:

                  (a) After giving effect to the amendments to the Credit
         Agreement set forth in this Amendment, no Default or Event of Default
         has occurred and is continuing; and

                  (b) The representations and warranties made or deemed made by
         the Borrower and each other Loan Party in the Loan Documents to which
         any of them is a party, are true and correct on and as of the date of
         this Amendment with the same force and effect as if made on and as of
         such date except to the extent that such representations and warranties
         expressly relate solely to an earlier date (in which case such
         representations and warranties shall have been true and accurate on and
         as of such earlier date) and except for changes in factual
         circumstances specifically and expressly permitted under the Credit
         Agreement.

III.     EFFECTIVENESS.

                  This Amendment shall become effective upon the occurrence of
each of the following events:

                  (a) This Amendment shall be duly executed and delivered by the
         Borrower and the Lenders constituting the Requisite Lenders;

                  (c) Each of the Guarantors shall have executed and delivered a
         Reaffirmation of Guaranty in form and substance satisfactory to the

                  (e) The Borrower shall have paid to the Tranche B Agent for
         the account of each Tranche B Lender an upfront fee equal to
         one-quarter of one percent (0.25%) of the amount of such Tranche B
         Lender's initial Tranche B Commitment.

IV.      GENERAL.

         A. The Credit Agreement, as amended by this Amendment, is ratified and
confirmed and shall continue in full force and effect. This Amendment shall

different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when so
executed and delivered shall be deemed an original, but all of which
counterparts together shall constitute but one and the same instrument.

         D. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree as follows:

                  THE AMENDED AND RESTATED DECLARATION OF TRUST ESTABLISHING THE

THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION SHALL NOT LIMIT ANY OBLIGATIONS OF ANY LOAN PARTY
