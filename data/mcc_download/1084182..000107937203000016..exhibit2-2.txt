in any capacity, engage or have a financial interest in any Competing Business
(as defined below) or provide managerial, supervisory, administrative, financial
or consulting services relating to the business of any Competing Business,
including making available any information or funding to any such Competing
Business; provided that the foregoing restrictions shall not restrict Paul
Marin from owning up to five percent (5%) of any entity whose equity securities

the foregoing restrictions are too broad or otherwise unreasonable under
applicable law, including with respect to time or space, the court is hereby
requested and authorized by the parties to revise the foregoing restrictions to
include the maximum restrictions allowable under applicable law.  Each of the

<PAGE>



information is in the public domain through no wrongful act of Zach Bair or
such disclosure is required by law.  For purposes of this Agreement, "Trade
Secrets" means all know-how, trade secrets, confidential information, subscriber
and visitor lists, business and product plans, hardware and software designs and
code, product specifications and documentation, technical information, data,
process technology, plans, drawings, and blue prints, owned, used or licensed
(as licensor or licensee) by Zach Bair.

In the event of any breach or threatened breach by Zach Bair of any provision
of this Section 6, the Purchaser shall be entitled to injunctive or other
equitable relief, restraining such party from engaging in conduct that would
constitute a breach of the obligations of Zach Bair under this Section.  Such
relief shall be in addition to and not in lieu of any other remedies that may
be available, including an action for the recovery of damages.

severally reimburse and indemnify and hold Purchaser and its officers,
directors, employees, affiliates and agents (collectively, the "Purchaser
Parties") harmless against and in respect of any and all damage, loss,
liability, deficiency, settlement payments, costs, levies, expenses or
obligations, whether or not the result of a third party claim (collectively,
"Damages"), in connection with, resulting from or relating to:

                  (1) any and all Unassumed Liabilities;

                  (2) any misrepresentation, breach of representation or
warranty or nonfulfillment of any covenant or agreement on the part of Paul
Marin under this Agreement;

                  (3) any claim that any Intellectual Property used in the
Systems constitutes an infringement of any intellectual property right of any
third party;

                  (4) noncompliance with the provisions of the bulk sales law of
any state that may be applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby;

                  (5) any and all actions, suits, claims, allegations,

<PAGE>




         7.3 Indemnification by the Purchaser.  The Purchaser shall reimburse
and indemnify and hold Zach Bair ("Zach Bair Parties") harmless against
and in respect of any Damages in connection with, resulting from or relating to:

                  (1) any and all Assumed Liabilities (except for those
liabilities and obligations for which Zach Bair is required to indemnify the
Purchaser under Section 7.2);

                  (2) any misrepresentation, breach of representation or
warranty or nonfulfillment of any covenant or agreement on the part of the
Purchaser under this Agreement; and

                  (3) any and all actions, suits, claims, allegations,
proceedings, investigations, audits, demands, assessments, fines, judgments,
settlements, levies, costs and other expenses (including without limitation
reasonable audit and legal fees) incident to the foregoing or the enforcement of
this Section 7.3.

7.4      Procedure for Indemnification.

                  (1) Third Party Claims.  If any claim is made against a party
(an "Indemnified Party") that, if sustained, would give rise to a liability of
another party (the "Indemnifying Party") under this Agreement (a "Third Party
Claim"), the Indemnified Party shall promptly, and in any case within ten (10)
business days of its receipt of notice of such Third Party Claim, cause notice
of the Third Party Claim to be delivered to the Indemnifying Party along with
all of the facts, information or materials relating to such claim of which the
Indemnified Party is aware (the "Claim Notice"), provided however, that failure
to give such notification shall not affect the indemnification provided
hereunder except to the extent the Indemnifying Party shall have been actually
prejudiced as a result of such failure.

                  (i) The Indemnifying Party shall have ten (10) calendar days
         after delivery thereof to elect, in writing to the Indemnified Party,
         to defend or settle the Third Party Claim, at its own expense. Until
         written notice electing to defend or settle any Third Party Claim, the
         Indemnified Party may take, at the expense of the Indemnifying Party,
         any action it reasonably believes necessary to preserve its rights with
         respect to such Third Party Claim.  If the Indemnifying Party does not
         assume the defense of any claim, then the Indemnified Party may defend
         against such Third Party Claim in such manner as it deems appropriate
         at the expense of the Indemnifying Party.


                                     15

<PAGE>


                  (ii) If a Third Party Claim is made against an Indemnified
         Party, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in the
         defense thereof and, if it so chooses, to assume the defense thereof
         with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party, which counsel must be
         reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, provided that all
         Indemnifying Parties with respect to such Third Party Claim jointly
         acknowledge to the Indemnified Party its right to indemnity pursuant
         hereto in respect of the entirety of such claim and provide assurances
         reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party that the Indemnifying
         Parties will be financially able to satisfy such claim in full if it is
         decided adversely. Should the Indemnifying Party so elect to assume the
         defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall not be
         liable to the Indemnified Party for legal expenses subsequently
         incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense
         thereof (except as hereinafter provided), but shall continue to pay for
         any expenses of investigation or any Damage suffered. If the

         Indemnifying Party assumes such defense, the Indemnified Party shall
         have the right to participate in the defense thereof and to employ
         counsel, at its own expense (except as hereinafter provided), separate
         from the counsel employed by the Indemnifying Party. Notwithstanding
         the foregoing, if (a) the Indemnifying Party shall not assume the
         defense of a Third Party Claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to
         the Indemnified Party within ten (10) business days of any Claim
         Notice, or (b) legal counsel for the Indemnified Party notifies the
         Indemnifying Party that there are or may be legal defenses available to
         the Indemnified Party or to other Indemnified Parties which are
         different from or additional to those available to the Indemnifying
         Party, which, if the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party were
         to be represented by the same counsel, would constitute a conflict of
         interest for such counsel or prejudice prosecution of the defenses
         available to such Indemnified Party, or (c) if the Indemnifying Party
         shall assume the defense of a Third Party Claim and fails to diligently
         and vigorously prosecute such defense in a timely manner after due
         notice, then in each such case the Indemnified Party, by notice to the
         Indemnifying Party, may employ its own counsel and control the defense
         of the Third Party Claim and the Indemnifying Party shall be liable for
         the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of counsel employed by
         the Indemnified Party and the Indemnified Party shall be promptly
         reimbursed for any such fees, charges and disbursements, as and when
         incurred. Whether the Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Party
         control the defense of any Third Party Claim, the parties hereto shall
         cooperate in the defense thereof. Such cooperation shall include the
         retention and provision to the counsel of the controlling party of
         records and information that are reasonably relevant to such Third
         Party Claim, and making employees available on a mutually convenient
         basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material
         provided hereunder. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to
         settle, compromise or discharge a Third Party Claim (other than any
         such Third Party Claim in which criminal conduct is alleged) without



                                    16

<PAGE>



         the Indemnified Party's consent if such settlement, compromise or
         discharge (x) constitutes a complete and unconditional discharge and
         release of all Indemnified Parties, and (y) provides for no relief
         other than the payment of monetary damages and such monetary damages
         are paid in full by the Indemnifying Party, and in all other cases may
         not so settle without the prior written consent of the Indemnified
         Party.

                  (2) Claims by the Purchaser or Claims by the Seller.  In the
event the Indemnified Party should have a claim against the Indemnifying Party
that does not involve a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall promptly
cause notice of such claim to be delivered to the Indemnifying Party.  If the
Indemnifying Party (i) does not notify the Indemnified Party within fifteen (15)
calendar days after the Indemnified Party's notice that it disputes such claim
or (ii) notifies the Indemnified Party that it does not dispute such claim, the
amount of such claim shall be conclusively deemed as a liability of the
Indemnifying Party under Section 7.1.  If the Indemnifying Party has timely
disputed its liability with respect to such claim, the parties will proceed in
good faith to negotiate a resolution to such dispute, and if not resolved within
twenty (20) business days, shall be resolved by confidential binding arbitration
in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association.  The
decision of the arbitrator shall be final, conclusive and binding on the parties
to the arbitration. Judgment may be entered on the arbitrator's
decision in any court having jurisdiction.

8.       Miscellaneous.

         8.1 Broker's Fees.  Each of the parties hereto represents and warrants
that it has not taken and will not take any action that would cause any other
party hereto to have any obligation or liability to any person for a finder's or
broker's fee and agrees to indemnify the other parties hereto for breach of the
foregoing representation and warranty.

         8.2 Expenses. Each party hereto shall pay its own expenses, including
without limitation the reasonable fees and expenses of its, his or her counsel,

hereby.

agree to defend and indemnify the Purchaser against and hold it harmless from
any and all loss, liability, claims, damage or expense (including reasonable
attorneys' fees) arising out of or resulting from such noncompliance, as
provided in Section 7.
