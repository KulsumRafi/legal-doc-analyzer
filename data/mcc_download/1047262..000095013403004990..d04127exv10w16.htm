telephone as requested by EXE, but you will not report to the office unless
reasonably requested by Ken Vines. Prior to your termination date, you will not
contact any EXE prospects, customers, partners, employees, contractors or
similar persons or incur additional expenses without the prior written approval
of Ken Vines. Subsequent to your termination date, the foregoing activities will
be governed as specified in Section&nbsp;6 below. In addition, effective October&nbsp;3,
2002, you no longer have authority to act in any way, including without
limitation by executing documents, on behalf of EXE without the prior written
approval of Ken Vines.

<P><FONT size="2">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Satisfaction. Other than expenses previously approved in writing by Ken
Vines, you will deliver a final expense report to Ken Vines no later than

practices of your portion of the premiums for such benefits. You will no longer
be eligible for any other benefits other than those specified in the first
sentence of this section after October&nbsp;31, 2002. The Company will pay you
$3,172.95, less applicable withholding, for your three days of earned but unused
vacation in accordance with normal payroll practices. You are no longer eligible
for bonuses and no further bonuses will be paid to you and you acknowledge that
you will no longer accrue vacation and will not be entitled to payment for any
additional vacation. EXE&#146;s payment of the amounts above is conditioned upon your
execution of this separation agreement and compliance with EXE&#146;s exit
procedures, including completion of EXE&#146;s current employee exit forms.
