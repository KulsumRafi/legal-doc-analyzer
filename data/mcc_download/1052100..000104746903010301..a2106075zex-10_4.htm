the Board may, from time to time, award Director Stock Options and/or Director Restricted Stock hereunder on a non-formula basis to all or such individual Outside Directors as it shall
select. Such Director Stock Options or Director Restricted Stock may be awarded at such times and for such number of shares as the Board in its sole discretion determines. The price of such Director
Stock Options may be fixed by the Board at a discount not to exceed 25% of the Fair Market Value of the Stock on the date of grant or may be the Fair Market Value of the Stock on the grant date. Such
Director Stock Options shall become first exercisable and have an option term as determined by the Board in its sole discretion; provided, however, that except as described in Section&nbsp;13 and in
paragraph&nbsp;(e) of this section, no such Director Stock Option shall be first exercisable until six months from the date of grant. Except as described in Section&nbsp;13 and in

SIZE=2><I>Method of Exercise</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any Director Stock Option granted pursuant to the Plan may be exercised in whole or in
part at any time during the option period, by giving written notice of exercise to the Company specifying the number of shares to be purchased, accompanied by payment in full of the purchase price, in
cash, by check or such other instrument as may be acceptable to the Committee (including instruments providing for "cashless exercise"). As determined by the Committee, in its sole discretion, at or
after grant, payment in full or in part may also be made in the form of unrestricted Stock already owned by the optionee (based, in each case, on the Fair Market Value of the Stock on the date the
option is exercised, as determined by the Committee). An optionee shall have rights to dividends or other stockholder rights with respect to shares subject to the option when the optionee has given
written notice of exercise and has paid in full for such shares. </FONT></P>

SIZE=2><I>Transferability</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No Director Stock Option shall be transferable by the optionee other than by will or by the
laws of descent and distribution, and all Director Stock Options shall be exercisable, during the optionee's lifetime, only by the optionee; provided, however, that the Committee may (but need not)
permit other transfers where the Committee concludes, in its sole discretion, that such transferability (i)&nbsp;does not result in accelerated taxation, and (ii)&nbsp;is otherwise appropriate and
desirable, taking into account any factors considered relevant by the Committee, including, without limitation, any state or federal securities laws applicable to transferable options. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><I>Termination of Service</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon an optionee's termination of status as an Outside Director for any reason, any
Director Stock Options held by such optionee shall become immediately exercisable and may thereafter be exercised during the period ending on the expiration of the stated term of such Director Stock
Options or the first anniversary of the optionee's death, whichever is later. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if the optionee's status as an Outside Director terminates by reason of or within
three months after a merger or other business combination resulting in a "Change in Control" as defined in Section&nbsp;13, each Director Stock Option held by such optionee shall terminate upon the
latest of (i)&nbsp;six months and one day after the merger or business combination, (ii)&nbsp;ten business days following the expiration of the period during which publication of financial results
covering at least thirty days of post-merger combined operations has occurred, or (iii)&nbsp;the expiration of the stated term of such Director Stock Option. Upon the termination of a
participant's status as an Outside Director for any reason, all restrictions, including restrictions regarding forfeiture and nontransferability, placed upon any Director Restricted Stock held by such
participant shall lapse;

Restricted Stock, the time or times within which such awards may be subject to forfeiture and nontransferability, and all other terms and conditions of the awards (subject to Sections 8(b), (c), (d),

sole discretion. The provisions of Restricted Stock awards need not be the same with respect to each recipient. Shares of Restricted Stock may be issued either alone or in addition to other awards

Committee may specify) after the award date by executing a Restricted Stock Award Agreement and paying the price, if any, specified in the Restricted Stock Award Agreement. An account for each
participant who is awarded Restricted Stock shall be opened with the Company's transfer agent or such other administrator designated by the Committee for the deposit of the shares of Restricted Stock
subject to the Award, or, in the sole discretion of the Committee, each participant may be issued a stock certificate registered in the name of the participant with respect to such shares of
Restricted Stock. The Committee shall specify that the certificate, if any, shall bear a legend, as provided in clause&nbsp;(i) below, and/or be held in custody by the Company, as provided in
