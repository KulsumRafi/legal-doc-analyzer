                   REPORTING REQUIREMENTS ON COMPLETION DATE;
            THE LESSEE'S DELIVERY OF NOTICES; RESTRICTIONS ON LIENS.

     5.1. General.

          (a) To the extent funds have been advanced to the Lessor as Loans by
     the Lenders and to the Lessor as Holder Advances by the Holders, the Lessor
     will use such funds from time to time in accordance with the terms and
     conditions of this Agreement and the other Operative Agreements (i) at the
     direction of the Construction Agent to acquire the Properties in accordance
     with the terms of this Agreement, the Agency Agreement and the other
     Operative Agreements, (ii) to satisfy the Bridge Financing as of the
     Initial Closing Date, (iii) to make Advances to the Construction Agent to

     Agency Agreement and the other Operative Agreements, and (iv) to pay
     Transaction Expenses, fees, expenses and other disbursements payable by the
     Lessor under Sections 7.1(a), 7.1(b) and 11.8.

          (b) In lieu of the payment of interest on the Loans and Holder Yield

     to any Property during the period prior to the Rent Commencement Date with
     respect to such Property and subject to Section 5.13, (i) each Lender's
     Loan shall automatically be increased by the amount of interest accrued and
     unpaid on such Loan for such period (except to the extent that at any time
     such increase would cause such Lender's Loan to exceed such Lender's
     Available Commitment, in which case the Lessee shall pay such excess amount
     to such Lender in immediately available funds on the date such Lender's
     Available Commitment was exceeded), and (ii) each Holder's Holder Advance
     shall automatically be increased by the amount of Holder Yield accrued and
     unpaid on such Holder Advance for such period (except to the extent that at
     any time such increase would cause the Holder Advance of such Holder to
     exceed such Holder's Available Holder Commitment, in which case the Lessee
     shall pay such excess amount to such Holder in immediately available funds
     on the date the Available Holder Commitment of such Holder was exceeded).
     Such increases in a Lender's Loan and a Holder's Holder Advance shall occur
     without any disbursement of funds by any Person.

     5.2. Procedures for Funding.

          (a) The Construction Agent shall designate the date for Advances
     hereunder in accordance with the terms and provisions hereof; provided,
     however, it is understood and agreed that no more than two (2) Advances
     (excluding any conversion and/or continuation of any Loan or Holder
     Advance) may be requested during any calendar month and no such designation
     from the Construction Agent is required for funding of Transaction
     Expenses, fees, expenses and other disbursements payable by the Lessor
     under Sections 7.1(a), 7.1(b) and 11.8. Not less than (i) three (3)
     Business Days prior to

                                        4

<PAGE>

     the date that the first Advance is requested hereunder and (ii) three (3)
     Business Days prior to the date on which any subsequent Acquisition Advance
     or Construction Advance is to be made, the Construction Agent shall deliver
     to the Agent, (A) with respect to the date that the first Advance is
     requested hereunder and each subsequent Acquisition Advance, a Requisition
     as described in Section 4.2 hereof (including without limitation a legal
     description of the Land, if any, a schedule of the Improvements, if any,
     and a schedule of the Equipment, if any, acquired or to be acquired on such
     date, and a schedule of the Work, if any, to be performed, each of the
     foregoing in a form reasonably acceptable to the Agent) and (B) with
     respect to each Construction Advance, a Requisition identifying (among
     other things) the Property to which such Construction Advance relates.

          (b) Each Requisition shall: (i) be irrevocable, (ii) request funds in
     an amount that is not in excess of the total aggregate of the Available
     Commitments plus the Available Holder Commitments at such time, and (iii)
     request that the Holders make Holder Advances and that the Lenders make

     such Advance, shall be applied regarding the applicable Advance to repay
     the Lenders and the Holders and, subject to the terms hereof, and of the
     Credit Agreement and the Trust Agreement, shall remain available for future
     Advances. Any such amounts held by the Lessor (or the Agent on behalf of
     the Lessor) shall be subject to the lien of the Security Agreement.

          (e) All Operative Agreements which are to be delivered to the Lessor,

          (w) Each Credit Party has (i) initiated a review and assessment of all
     areas within its and each of its Subsidiaries' business and operations
     (including those affected by suppliers, vendors and customers of each
     Credit Party and the Subsidiaries of each Credit Party) that could be
     adversely affected by the Year 2000 Problem, (ii) developed a plan and
     timeline for addressing the Year 2000 Problem on a timely basis and (iii)
     to date, implemented that plan in accordance with that timetable. Based on
     the foregoing, each Credit Party believes that all computer applications
     (including those of suppliers, vendors and customers of each Credit Party
     and the Subsidiaries of each Credit Party) that are material to its or any
     of its Subsidiaries' business and operations are reasonably expected on a
     timely basis to be able to perform properly date-sensitive functions for
     all dates before and after January 1, 2000 (that is, be "Year 2000
     Compliant"), except to the extent that a failure to do so shall not have
     and could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

                              SECTION 6B. GUARANTY

     6B.1. Guaranty of Payment and Performance.

     Subject to Section 6B.7, each Guarantor hereby, jointly and severally,
unconditionally guarantees to each Financing Party the prompt payment and
performance of the Company Obligations in full when due (whether at stated
maturity, as a mandatory prepayment, by acceleration or otherwise) or when such
is otherwise to be performed; provided, notwithstanding the foregoing, the
obligations of the Guarantors under this Section 6B shall not constitute a
direct guaranty of the indebtedness of the Lessor evidenced by the Notes but
rather a guaranty of the Company Obligations arising under the Operative
Agreements. This Section 6B is a guaranty of payment and performance and not of
collection and is a continuing guaranty and shall apply to all Company
Obligations whenever arising. All rights granted to the Financing Parties under
this Section 6B shall be subject to the provisions of Section 8.2(h) and 8.6.

     6B.2. Obligations Unconditional.

     Each Guarantor agrees that the obligations of the Guarantors hereunder are
absolute and unconditional, irrespective of the value, genuineness, validity,
regularity or enforceability of any of the Operative Agreements, or any other
agreement or instrument referred to therein, or any substitution, release or
exchange of any other guarantee of or security for any of the Company
Obligations, and, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law,
irrespective of any other circumstance whatsoever which might otherwise
constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a surety, guarantor or
co-obligor, it being the intent of this Section 6B.2 that the obligations of the
Guarantors hereunder shall be absolute and unconditional under any and all
circumstances. Each Guarantor agrees that this Section 6B may be enforced by the
Financing Parties without the necessity at any time of resorting to or
exhausting any other security or collateral and without the necessity at any
time of having recourse to the Notes, the Certificates or any other of the
Operative Agreements or any collateral, if any, hereafter securing the Company
Obligations or otherwise and each Guarantor hereby waives the right to require
the Financing Parties to proceed against the

                                       23

<PAGE>

Construction Agent, the Lessee or any other Person (including without limitation
a co-guarantor) or to require the Financing Parties to pursue any other remedy
or enforce any other right. Each Guarantor further agrees that it hereby waives
any and all right of subrogation, indemnity, reimbursement or contribution
against the Lessee and the Construction Agent or any other Guarantor of the
Company Obligations for amounts paid under this Section 6B until such time as
the Loans, Holder Advances, accrued but unpaid interest, accrued but unpaid
Holder Yield and all other amounts owing under the Operative Agreements have
been paid in full. Without limiting the generality of the waiver provisions of
this Section 6B, each Guarantor hereby waives any rights to require the
Financing Parties to proceed against the Construction Agent, the Lessee or any
co-guarantor or to require Lessor to pursue any other remedy or enforce any
other right, including without limitation, any and all rights under N.C. Gen.
Stat. (S) 26-7 through 26-9. Each Guarantor further agrees that nothing
contained herein shall prevent the Financing Parties from suing on any Operative
Agreement or foreclosing any security interest in or Lien on any collateral, if
any, securing the Company Obligations or from exercising any other rights
available to it under any Operative Agreement, or any other instrument of
security, if any, and the exercise of any of the aforesaid rights and the
completion of any foreclosure proceedings shall not constitute a discharge of
any Guarantor's obligations hereunder; it being the purpose and intent of each
Guarantor that its obligations hereunder shall be absolute, independent and
unconditional under any and all circumstances; provided that any amounts due
under this Section 6B which are paid to or for the benefit of any Financing
Party shall reduce the Company Obligations by a corresponding amount (unless
required to be rescinded at a later date). Neither any Guarantor's obligations
under this Section 6B nor any remedy for the enforcement thereof shall be
impaired, modified, changed or released in any manner whatsoever by an
impairment, modification, change, release or limitation of the liability of the
Construction Agent or the Lessee or by reason of the bankruptcy or insolvency of
the Construction Agent or the Lessee. Each Guarantor waives any and all notice
of the creation, renewal, extension or accrual of any of the Company Obligations
and notice of or proof of reliance by any Financing Party upon this Section 6B
or acceptance of this Section 6B. The Company Obligations shall conclusively be
deemed to have been created, contracted or incurred, or renewed, extended,
amended or waived, in reliance upon this Section 6B. All dealings between the
Construction Agent, the Lessee and any of the Guarantors, on the one hand, and
the Financing Parties, on the other hand, likewise shall be conclusively
presumed to have been had or consummated in reliance upon this Section 6B.

     6B.3. Modifications.

     Each Guarantor agrees that (a) all or any part of the security now or
hereafter held for the Company Obligations, if any, may be exchanged,
compromised or surrendered from time to time; (b) no Financing Party shall have
any obligation to protect, perfect, secure or insure any such security
interests, liens or encumbrances now or hereafter held, if any, for the Company
Obligations or the properties subject thereto; (c) the time or place of payment
of the Company Obligations may be changed or extended, in whole or in part, to a
time certain or otherwise, and may be renewed or accelerated, in whole or in
part; (d) the Construction Agent, the Lessee and any other party liable for
payment under the Operative Agreements may be granted indulgences generally; (e)
any of the provisions of the Notes, the Certificates or any of the other
Operative Agreements may be modified, amended or waived; (f) any party
(including any co-guarantor) liable for the payment thereof may

                                       24

<PAGE>

be granted indulgences or be released; and (g) any deposit balance for the
credit of the Construction Agent, the Lessee or any other party liable for the
payment of the Company Obligations or liable upon any security therefor may be
released, in whole or in part, at, before or after the stated, extended or
accelerated maturity of the Company Obligations, all without notice to or
further assent by such Guarantor, which shall remain bound thereon,
notwithstanding any such exchange, compromise, surrender, extension, renewal,
acceleration, modification, indulgence or release.

     6B.4. Waiver of Rights.

     Each Guarantor expressly waives to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law: (a) notice of acceptance of this Section 6B by any Financing
Party and of all extensions of credit or other Advances to the Construction
Agent and the Lessee by the Lenders pursuant to the terms of the Operative
Agreements; (b) presentment and demand for payment or performance of any of the
Company Obligations; (c) protest and notice of dishonor or of default with
respect to the Company Obligations or with respect to any security therefor; (d)
notice of any Financing Party obtaining, amending, substituting for, releasing,
waiving or modifying any security interest, lien or encumbrance, if any,
hereafter securing the Company Obligations, or any Financing Party's
subordinating, compromising, discharging or releasing such security interests,
liens or encumbrances, if any; and (e) all other notices to which such Guarantor
might otherwise be entitled. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
(i) each Guarantor's payments hereunder shall be due ten (10) Business Days
after written demand by the Agent for such payment (unless the Company
Obligations are automatically accelerated pursuant to the applicable provisions
of the Operative Agreements in which case the Guarantors' payments shall be
automatically due) and (ii) any modification of the Operative Agreements which
has the effect of increasing the Company Obligations shall not be enforceable
against a Guarantor unless such Guarantor executes the document evidencing such
modification or otherwise reaffirms its guaranty in writing in connection with
such modification.

     6B.5. Reinstatement.

     The obligations of the Guarantors under this Section 6B shall be
automatically reinstated if and to the extent that for any reason any payment by
or on behalf of any Person in respect of the Company Obligations is rescinded or
must be otherwise restored by any holder of any of the Company Obligations,
whether as a result of any proceedings in bankruptcy or reorganization or
otherwise, and each Guarantor agrees that it will indemnify each Financing Party
on demand for all reasonable costs and expenses (including, without limitation,
reasonable fees of counsel) incurred by any Financing Party in connection with
such rescission or restoration, including without limitation any such costs and
expenses incurred in defending against any claim alleging that such payment
constituted a preference, fraudulent transfer or similar payment under any
bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law.

     6B.6. Remedies.

     The Guarantors agree that, as between the Guarantors, on the one hand, and
each Financing Party, on the other hand, the Company Obligations may be declared
to be forthwith due and payable

                                       25

<PAGE>

as provided in the applicable provisions of the Operative Agreements (and shall
be deemed to have become automatically due and payable in the circumstances
provided therein) notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition
preventing such declaration (or preventing such Company Obligations from
becoming automatically due and payable) as against any other Person and that, in
the event of such declaration (or such Company Obligations being deemed to have
become automatically due and payable), such Company Obligations (whether or not
due and payable by any other Person) shall forthwith become due and payable by
the Guarantors in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Operative
Agreements.

     6B.7. Limitation of Guaranty.

     Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained herein or in any of
the other Operative Agreements, to the extent the obligations of any Guarantor
shall be adjudicated to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason (including
without limitation because of any applicable state or federal law relating to
fraudulent conveyances or transfers) then the obligations of such Guarantor
hereunder shall be limited to the maximum amount that is permissible under
applicable law (whether federal or state and including without limitation the
Bankruptcy Code).

     Subject to Section 6B.5, upon the satisfaction of the Company Obligations
in full, regardless of the source of payment, the Guarantors' obligations
hereunder shall be deemed satisfied, discharged and terminated other than
indemnifications set forth herein that expressly survive.

     6B.8. Payment of Amounts to the Agent.

     Each Financing Party hereby instructs each Guarantor, and each Guarantor
hereby acknowledges and agrees, that until such time as the Loans and the Holder
Advances are paid in full and the Liens evidenced by the Security Agreement and
the Mortgage Instruments have been released any and all Rent (excluding Excepted
Payments which shall be payable to each Holder or other Person as appropriate)
and any and all other amounts of any kind or type under any of the Operative
Agreements due and owing or payable to any Person shall instead be paid directly
to the Agent (excluding Excepted Payments which shall be payable to each Holder
or other Person as appropriate) or as the Agent may direct from time to time for
allocation and distribution in accordance with the procedures set forth in
Section 8.7 hereof.

     6B.9. Release of Guarantors.

     Each Financing Party hereby agrees that (a) the Agent shall be permitted to
release any Guarantor from its guaranty obligations under this Section 6B
without the consent of any other Financing Party if the release is granted in
connection with a disposition by the applicable Credit Party of all the shares
of stock or partnership or other equity interest in such Guarantor and such
disposition is permitted pursuant to the applicable provisions of the Operative
Agreements and (b) the Agent shall be permitted to release any Guarantor from
its guaranty obligations under this Section 6B.9 without the consent of any
other Financing Party if the release is requested by the Lessee in connection
with a dissolution of the Guarantor, subject to the Lessee providing to the

                                       26

<PAGE>

Agent written representations to the effect that such Guarantor has no business
operations and no assets.

     The Lessee agrees to pay or cause to be paid (a) the initial Owner
Trustee's fee of $5,000, the annual Owner Trustee's fee of $5,000 and all
reasonable expenses of the Owner Trustee and any co-trustees (including without
limitation reasonable counsel fees and expenses) or any successor owner trustee

waivers of consents hereto or thereto, which have been requested by any Credit
Party, the Agent, the Lenders, the Holders or the Lessor, (c) all reasonable

by the Credit Parties, the Agent, the Lenders, the Holders or the Lessor in

     During the Term, the Lessee shall pay to the Agent for the account of (a)
the Lenders, respectively, a facility fee (the "Lender Facility Fee") equal to
the product of $29,100,000 (or such greater amount to the extent the Lender
Commitment is hereinafter increased) multiplied by the Applicable Percentage and
(b) the Holders, respectively, a facility fee (the "Holder Facility Fee") equal

Commitment is hereinafter increased) multiplied by the applicable percentage.
The Lender Facility Fee shall be ratably distributed to each Lender based upon
the Lender Commitment of each Lender. The Holder Facility Fee shall be ratably
distributed to each Holder based upon the Holder Commitment of each Holder. Such
Facility Fees shall be payable quarterly in arrears on each Facility Fee Payment
Date. If all or a portion of any such Facility Fee shall not be paid

                                       28

<PAGE>

when due, such overdue amount shall bear interest, payable by the Lessee on
demand, at a rate per annum equal to the ABR (or in the case of Holder Yield,
the ABR plus the Applicable Percentage for Eurodollar Holder Advances) plus two
percent (2%) from the date of such non-payment until such amount is paid in full
(as well as before judgment). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Lessee may
cause the Lessor to fund all such Facility Fees during the Commitment Period to
the extent the applicable conditions precedent are satisfied under the Operative
Agreements.

     7.5. [Intentionally Omitted]

     7.6. Structuring Fee.

     Pursuant to the fee letter dated August 24, 1998 from NationsBanc
Montgomery Securities LLC and NationsBank, N.A. to Mr. Robert P. Komin, Jr.,
Vice President Finance and Treasurer of Convergys (and accepted by him on behalf
of Convergys), the Lessee agreed to pay various fees including without
limitation a structuring and arranging fee in accordance with the terms of such
fee letter; provided, however, to the extent the accountants for the Lessee
subsequently state in writing that the structure of the transaction evidenced by
the Operative Agreements will not provide the Lessee with off-balance sheet
financing, then such structuring and arranging fee will be limited to $50,000
plus any other expenses incurred to such date. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Lessee may cause the Lessor to fund all such fees referenced in such fee
letter during the Commitment Period to the extent the applicable conditions
precedent are satisfied under the Operative Agreements.

                   SECTION 8. OTHER COVENANTS AND AGREEMENTS.

     8.1. Cooperation with the Construction Agent or the Lessee.

     The Holders, the Lenders, the Lessor (at the direction of the Majority
Secured Parties) and the Agent shall, at the expense of and to the extent
reasonably requested by the Construction Agent or the Lessee (but without
assuming additional liabilities on account thereof and only to the extent such

Majority Secured Parties) and the Agent in their reasonable discretion),
cooperate with the Construction Agent or the Lessee in connection with the

     discharged, all Lessor Liens on the Properties attributable to it;
     provided, however, that the Owner Trustee and the Holders shall not be
     required to so discharge any such Lessor Lien while the same is being
     contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings diligently prosecuted so
     long as such proceedings shall not materially and adversely affect the
     rights of the Lessee under the Lease and the other Operative Agreements or
     involve any material danger of impairment of the Liens of the Security
     Documents or of the sale, forfeiture or loss of, and shall not interfere
     with the use or disposition of, any Property or title thereto or any
     interest therein or the payment of Rent;

     adversely affect the rights of any such party without the prior written
     consent of such party and (iii) to comply with all of the terms of the

     Holders as the Owner Trustee, a successor Owner Trustee may be appointed
     and a corporation may become the Owner Trustee under the Trust Agreement,
     only in accordance with the provisions of Article IX of the Trust Agreement
     and, with respect to such appointment, with the consent of the Lessee (so
     long as there shall be no Lease Event of Default that shall have occurred
     and be continuing), which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
     delayed;

          (d) The Owner Trustee, in its capacity as the Owner Trustee under the
     Trust Agreement, and not in its individual capacity, shall not contract

     composition or other relief with respect to it or its debts, or (ii) seek
     appointment of a receiver, trustee, custodian or other similar official

     to, approval of, or acquiescence in, any of the acts set forth in this
     paragraph;

          (g) The Owner Trustee shall give prompt notice to the Lessee, the

     accounts or contract rights relating to any Property are kept, shall cease
     to be located at 79 South Main Street, Salt Lake City, Utah 84111, or if it
     shall change its name;

          (a) Each Credit Party acknowledges and agrees that the Owner Trustee,
     pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Security Agreement and the
     Mortgage Instruments, shall create Liens respecting the various personal
     property, fixtures and real property described therein in favor of the
     Agent. Each Credit Party hereby irrevocably consents to the creation,
     perfection and maintenance of such Liens. Each Credit Party shall, to the

          outstanding, second, ratably to the payment of the principal and
          interest balance of the Tranche B Loans then outstanding, third,
          ratably to the payment of the principal balance of all Holder Advances
          plus all outstanding Holder Yield with respect to such outstanding
          Holder Advances, fourth, to the payment of any other amounts owing to
          the Lenders hereunder or under any of the other Operative Agreement,
          and fifth, to the extent moneys remain after application and
          allocation pursuant to clauses first through fourth above, to the
          Owner Trustee for application and allocation to Holder Advances and
          Holder Yield and any other amounts owing to the Holders or the Owner
          Trustee as the Holders shall determine.

               (v) An amount equal to any such payment identified as
          Supplemental Rent shall be applied and allocated by the Agent to the
          payment of any amounts then owing to the Agent, the Lenders, the
          Holders and the other parties to the Operative Agreements (or any of
          them) (other than any such amounts payable pursuant to the preceding
          provisions of this Section 8.7(b)) as shall be determined by the Agent
          in its reasonable discretion; provided, however, that Supplemental
          Rent received upon the exercise of remedies after the occurrence and
          continuance of an Event of Default in lieu of or in substitution of
          the Maximum Residual Guarantee Amount or as a partial payment thereon
          shall be applied and allocated as set forth in Section 8.7(b)(iv).

               (vi) The Agent in its reasonable judgment shall identify the
          nature of each payment or amount received by the Agent and apply and
          allocate each such amount in the manner specified above.

          (c) Upon the termination of the Commitments and the payment in full of
     the Loans and all other amounts owing by the Owner Trustee hereunder or
     under any Credit Document and the payment in full of all amounts owing to
     the Holders and the Owner Trustee under the Trust Agreement, any moneys
     remaining with the Agent shall be returned to the Owner Trustee or such
     other Person or Persons as the Holders may designate for application and
     allocation to any and all other amounts owing to the Holders or the Owner
     Trustee and as the Holders shall determine. In the event of an Acceleration
     it is agreed that, prior to the application and allocation of amounts
     received by the Agent in the order described in Section 8.7(b) above, any
     such amounts shall first be applied and allocated to the payment of (i) any
     and all sums advanced by the Agent in order to preserve the Collateral or
     to preserve its Lien thereon, (ii) the expenses of retaking, holding,
     preparing for sale or lease, selling or otherwise disposing or realizing on
     the

                                       40

     Collateral, or of any exercise by the Agent of its rights under the
     Security Documents, together with reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses
     and court costs and (iii) any and all other amounts reasonably owed to the
     Agent under or in connection with the transactions contemplated by the
     Operative Agreements (including without limitation any accrued and unpaid
     administration fees).

     8.8. Release of Properties, etc.

     If the Lessee shall at any time purchase any Property pursuant to the
Lease, or the Construction Agent shall purchase any Property pursuant to the
Agency Agreement, or if any Property shall be sold in accordance with Article
XXII of the Lease, then, upon satisfaction by the Owner Trustee of its
obligation to prepay the Loans, Holder Advances and all other amounts owing to
the Lenders and the Holders under the Operative Agreements, the Agent is hereby
authorized and directed to release such Properties from the Liens created by the
Security Documents to the extent of its interest therein. In addition, upon the
termination of the Commitments and the Holder Commitments and the payment in
full of the Loans, the Holder Advances and all other amounts owing by the Owner
Trustee and the Lessee hereunder or under any other Operative Agreement the
Agent is hereby authorized and directed to release all of the Properties from
the Liens created by the Security Documents to the extent of its interest
therein. Upon request of the Owner Trustee following any such release, the Agent
shall, at the sole cost and expense of the Lessee, execute and deliver to the
Owner Trustee and the Lessee such documents as the Owner Trustee or the Lessee
shall reasonably request to evidence such release.

     8.9. Release of Undeveloped Land from the Ground Lease.

     The Lessee shall have the option, exercisable by giving the Owner Trustee
no less than thirty (30) days written notice, of the Lessee's election to remove
and release a parcel of undeveloped land from the Ground Lease on the following
terms and conditions: (a) no Lease Default or Lease Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing as of the date of such notice or the date such parcel
is to be removed and released from the Ground Lease, (b) the applicable
Property, excluding such parcel which is to be removed and released from the
Ground Lease, shall continue to constitute an area with appropriate easement and
operating agreements such that the value and utility of such remaining Property
are not diminished, (c) the applicable Property, excluding such parcel which is
to be removed and released from the Ground Lease, shall (on and after the date
of such removal and release from the Ground Lease) satisfy all of the terms and
conditions of the Operative Agreements, (d) no portion of the Property financed
pursuant to the Operative Agreements shall be located on such parcel which is to
be removed and released from the Ground Lease and (e) all Rent due and payable
by the Lessee shall be paid on or prior to the date of such removal and release.

     Agreement.

     9.2. The Construction Agent's and the Lessee's Trust Agreement Rights.

     Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Trust Agreement,

to the occurrence and continuation of any Default or Event of Default, the

                       SECTION 10. [Intentionally Omitted]

                          SECTION 11. INDEMNIFICATION.

     11.1. General Indemnity.

     Subject to and limited by in all respects the provisions of Sections 11.6
through 11.8 and whether or not any of the transactions contemplated hereby
shall be consummated, the Indemnity Provider hereby assumes liability for and
agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnified Person on an
After Tax Basis from and against any Claims, which may be imposed on, incurred
by or asserted against an Indemnified Person by any third party, including
without limitation Claims arising from the negligence of an Indemnified Person
(but not to the extent such Claims arise from the (v) failure by an Indemnified
Person to comply with applicable state or federal banking Laws or other Laws,
(w) acts or omissions that occur after the Notes, Certificates and all other
amounts outstanding under or pursuant to the Operative Agreements have been paid
in full and the Lessee has either purchased the Properties in accordance with
the terms of the Operative Agreements or relinquished its interest in the
Properties in accordance with the terms of the Operative Agreements, (x) gross
negligence, (y) willful misconduct of such Indemnified Person itself, as
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction (as opposed to gross negligence
or willful misconduct imputed to such Indemnified Person) or (z) breach of such
Indemnified Person's obligations under this Agreement, the Lease or any other
Operative Agreement, except any breach by any Indemnified Person caused by any
breach by any Credit Party of any obligation of any Credit Party pursuant to the
Operative Agreements) in any way relating to or arising or alleged to arise out
of the execution, delivery, performance or enforcement of this Agreement, the
Lease or any other Operative Agreement or on or with respect to any Property or
any component thereof, including without limitation Claims in any way relating
to or arising or alleged to arise out of (a) the financing, refinancing,
purchase, ownership, design, construction, refurbishment, development, delivery,
acceptance, nondelivery, leasing, subleasing, possession, use, occupancy,
operation, maintenance repair, modification or any disposition of any Property
or any part thereof; (b) any latent or other defects in any Property or any
portion thereof whether or not discoverable by an Indemnified Person or the
Indemnity Provider; (c) a violation of Environmental Laws, Environmental Claims
or other loss of or damage to any property or the environment relating to the
Property, the Lease, the Agency Agreement or the Indemnity Provider
(collectively, such items referenced in this Section 11.1(c) may be referred to
as the "Environmental Matters"); (d) the Operative Agreements, or any

                                       43

<PAGE>

transaction contemplated thereby; (e) any breach by the Indemnity Provider of
any of its representations or warranties under the Operative Agreements to which
the Indemnity Provider is a party or failure by the Indemnity Provider to
perform or observe any covenant or agreement to be performed by it under any of
the Operative Agreements; (f) the transactions contemplated hereby or by any
other Operative Agreement, in respect of the application of Parts 4 and 5 of
Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA; (g) personal injury, death or property damage,
including without limitation Claims based on strict or absolute liability in
tort; and (h) any fees, expenses and/or other assessments by any business park
or any other similar entity for the applicable Property.

     If a written Claim is made against any Indemnified Person or if any
proceeding shall be commenced against such Indemnified Person (including without
limitation a written notice of such proceeding), for any Claim, such Indemnified
Person shall promptly notify the Indemnity Provider in writing and shall not
take action with respect to such Claim without the consent of the Indemnity
Provider for thirty (30) days after the receipt of such notice by the Indemnity
Provider; provided, however, that in the case of any such Claim, if action shall
be required by law or regulation to be taken prior to the end of such period of
thirty (30) days, such Indemnified Person shall endeavor to, in such notice to
the Indemnity Provider, inform the Indemnity Provider of such shorter period,
and no action shall be taken with respect to such Claim without the consent of
the Indemnity Provider before seven (7) days before the end of such shorter
period; provided, further, that the failure of such Indemnified Person to give
the notices referred to in this sentence shall not diminish the Indemnity
Provider's obligation hereunder except to the extent such failure precludes in
all respects the Indemnity Provider from contesting such Claim.

     If, within thirty (30) days of receipt of such notice from the Indemnified
Person (or such shorter period as the Indemnified Person has notified the
Indemnity Provider is required by law or regulation for the Indemnified Person
to respond to such Claim), the Indemnity Provider shall request in writing that
such Indemnified Person respond to such Claim, the Indemnified Person shall, at
the expense of the Indemnity Provider, in good faith conduct and control such
action (including without limitation by pursuit of appeals); provided, however,
that (A) if such Claim, in the Indemnity Provider's reasonable discretion, can
be pursued by the Indemnity Provider on behalf of or in the name of such
Indemnified Person, the Indemnified Person, at the Indemnity Provider's request,
shall allow the Indemnity Provider to conduct and control the response to such
Claim and (B) in the case of any Claim (and notwithstanding the provisions of
the foregoing subsection (A), the Indemnified Person may request the Indemnity
Provider to conduct and control the response to such Claim with counsel to be
selected by the Indemnity Provider after the solicitation and consideration of
any advice provided by such Indemnified Person; provided, however, that any
Indemnified Person may retain separate counsel at the expense of the Indemnity
Provider in the event of a material conflict of interest between such
Indemnified Person and the Indemnity Provider) by, in the sole discretion of the
Person conducting and controlling the response to such Claim (1) resisting
payment thereof, (2) not paying the same except under protest, if protest is
necessary and proper, (3) if the payment be made, using reasonable efforts to
obtain a refund thereof in appropriate administrative and judicial proceedings,
or (4) taking such other action as is reasonably requested by the Indemnity
Provider from time to time.

                                       44

<PAGE>

     The party controlling the response to any Claim shall consult in good faith
with the non-controlling party and shall keep the non-controlling party
reasonably informed as to the conduct of the response to such Claim; provided,
that all decisions ultimately shall be made in the discretion of the controlling
party. The parties agree that an Indemnified Person may at any time decline to
take further action with respect to the response to such Claim and may settle
such Claim if such Indemnified Person shall waive its rights to any indemnity
from the Indemnity Provider that otherwise would be payable in respect of such
Claim (and any future Claim, the pursuit of which is precluded by reason of such
resolution of such Claim) and shall pay to the Indemnity Provider any amount
previously paid or advanced by the Indemnity Provider pursuant to this Section
11.1 by way of indemnification or advance for the payment of an amount regarding
such Claim.

     Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 11.1, an
Indemnified Person shall not be required to take any action unless (A) the
Indemnity Provider shall have agreed to pay and shall pay to such Indemnified
Person on demand and on an After Tax Basis all reasonable costs, losses and
expenses that such Indemnified Person actually incurs in connection with such
Claim, including without limitation all reasonable legal, accounting and
investigatory fees and disbursements and, if the Indemnified Person has informed
the Indemnity Provider that it intends to contest such Claim (whether or not the
control of the contest is then assumed by the Indemnity Provider), the Indemnity
Provider shall have agreed that the Claim is an indemnifiable Claim hereunder,
(B) in the case of a Claim that must be pursued in the name of an Indemnified
Person (or an Affiliate thereof), the amount of the potential indemnity (taking
into account all similar or logically related Claims that have been or could be
raised for which the Indemnity Provider may be liable to pay an indemnity under
this Section 11.1) exceeds $250,000 (or such lesser amount as may be
subsequently agreed between the Indemnity Provider and the Indemnified Person),
(C) the Indemnified Person shall have reasonably determined that the action to
be taken will not result in any material danger of sale, forfeiture or loss of
the Property, or any part thereof or interest therein, will not interfere with
the payment of Rent, and will not result in risk of criminal liability, (D) if
such Claim shall involve the payment of any amount prior to the resolution of
such Claim, the Indemnity Provider shall provide to the Indemnified Person an
interest-free advance in an amount equal to the amount that the Indemnified
Person is reasonably required to pay upon advice of counsel (with no additional
net after-tax cost to such Indemnified Person) prior to the date such payment is
due, (E) in the case of a Claim that must be pursued in the name of an
Indemnified Person (or an Affiliate thereof), the Indemnity Provider shall have
caused to be provided to such Indemnified Person advice, but not an opinion, of
independent counsel selected by the Indemnity Provider and reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Person stating that a reasonable basis exists to
contest such Claim (or, in the case of an appeal of an adverse determination,
advice, but not an opinion, of such counsel to the effect that the position
asserted in such appeal will more likely than not prevail) and (F) no Event of
Default shall have occurred and be continuing. In no event shall an Indemnified
Person be required to appeal an adverse judicial determination to the United
States Supreme Court. In addition, an Indemnified Person shall not be required
to contest any Claim in its name (or that of an Affiliate) if the subject matter
thereof shall be of a continuing nature and shall have previously been decided
adversely by a court of competent jurisdiction pursuant to the contest
provisions of this Section 11.1, unless there shall have been a change in law
(or interpretation thereof) and the Indemnified

                                       45

<PAGE>

Person shall have received, at the Indemnity Provider's expense, advice, but not
an opinion, of independent counsel selected by the Indemnity Provider and
reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Person stating that as a result of such
change in law (or interpretation thereof), it is more likely than not that the
Indemnified Person will prevail in such contest. In no event shall the Indemnity
Provider be permitted to adjust or settle any Claim without the consent of the
Indemnified Person to the extent any such adjustment or settlement involves, or
is reasonably likely to involve, any performance by or adverse admission by or
with respect to the Indemnified Person.

     In the event that the Indemnity Provider shall be required to make any
payment under this Section 11.1 to an Indemnified Person, the Indemnified Person
agrees to take such reasonable action as is requested by the Indemnity Provider,
in writing, any such action to be at the risk and expense of the Indemnity
Provider, to minimize the consequences of the After-Tax Basis method of the
indemnity.

     11.2. General Tax Indemnity.

          (a) Subject to and limited by in all respects the provisions of this
     Section 11.2 and Sections 11.6 through 11.8, the Indemnity Provider shall
     pay and assume liability for, and does hereby agree to indemnify, protect
     and defend each Property and all Indemnified Persons, and hold them
     harmless against, (i) all Impositions on an After Tax Basis and (ii) taxes
     that are in the nature of gross income, privilege or doing business taxes
     (not included in the definition of Impositions) imposed on the Owner
     Trustee, the Trust, the Trust Estate or, to the extent related to the
     transactions contemplated hereby, the Trust Company, and all payments
     pursuant to the Operative Agreements shall be made free and clear of and
     without deduction for any and all present and future Impositions. In the
     event that the Indemnity Provider shall be required to make any payment
     under this Section 11.2(a) to an Indemnified Person, the Indemnified Person
     agrees to take such reasonable action as is requested by the Indemnity
     Provider, in writing, any such action to be at the risk and expense of the
     Indemnity Provider, to minimize the consequences of the After-Tax Basis
     method of the indemnity.

          (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 11.2(a)
     hereof, the following shall be excluded from the indemnity required by
     Section 11.2(a) (collectively, the "Excluded Taxes"):

               (i) Taxes (other than Taxes that are, or are in the nature of,
          sales, use, rental, value added, transfer or property taxes) that are
          imposed on any Indemnified Person (other than the Lessor, the Owner
          Trustee and the Trust) by the United States federal government that
          are based on or measured by the net income (including without
          limitation taxes based on capital gains and minimum taxes) of such
          Person; provided, that this clause (i) shall not be interpreted to
          prevent a payment from being made on an After Tax Basis if such
          payment is otherwise required to be so made;

                                       46

<PAGE>

               (ii) Taxes (other than Taxes that are, or are in the nature of,
          sales, use, rental, value added, transfer or property taxes) that are
          imposed on any Indemnified Person (other than the Lessor, the Owner
          Trustee and the Trust) by any state or local jurisdiction or taxing
          authority within any state or local jurisdiction and that are based
          upon or measured by the net income (including without limitation taxes
          based on capital gains and minimum taxes) of such Person; provided
          that such Taxes shall not be excluded under this subparagraph (ii) to
          the extent such Taxes would have been imposed had the location,
          possession or use of any Property in, the location or the operation of
          the Lessee in, or the Lessee's making payments under the Operative
          Agreements from, the jurisdiction imposing such Taxes been the sole
          connection between such Indemnified Person and the jurisdiction
          imposing such Taxes; provided, further, that this clause (ii) shall
          not be interpreted to prevent a payment from being made on an After
          Tax Basis if such payment is otherwise required to be so made;

               (iii) any Tax to the extent it relates to any act, event or
          omission that occurs after the termination of the Lease and redelivery
          or sale of the Property in accordance with the terms of the Lease (but
          not any Tax that relates to such termination, redelivery or sale
          and/or to any period prior to such termination, redelivery or sale);
          and

               (iv) any Taxes which are imposed on an Indemnified Person as a
          result of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such
          Indemnified Person itself, as determined by a court of competent
          jurisdiction (as opposed to gross negligence or willful misconduct
          imputed to such Indemnified Person), but not Taxes imposed as a result
          of ordinary negligence of such Indemnified Person;

          (c)   (i) Subject to the terms of Section 11.2(f), the Indemnity
          Provider shall pay or cause to be paid all Impositions directly to the
          taxing authorities where feasible and otherwise to the Indemnified
          Person, as appropriate, and the Indemnity Provider shall at its own
          expense, upon such Indemnified Person's reasonable request, furnish to
          such Indemnified Person copies of official receipts or other
          satisfactory proof evidencing such payment.

               (ii) In the case of Impositions for which no contest is conducted
          pursuant to Section 11.2(f) and which the Indemnity Provider pays
          directly to the taxing authorities, the Indemnity Provider shall pay
          such Impositions prior to the latest time permitted by the relevant
          taxing authority for timely payment. In the case of Impositions for
          which the Indemnity Provider reimburses an Indemnified Person, the
          Indemnity Provider shall do so within thirty (30) days after receipt
          by the Indemnity Provider of demand by such Indemnified Person
          describing in reasonable detail the nature of the Imposition and the
          basis for the demand (including without limitation the computation of
          the amount payable), accompanied by receipts or other reasonable
          evidence of such demand. In the case of Impositions for which a
          contest is conducted pursuant to Section 11.2(f),

                                       47

<PAGE>

          the Indemnity Provider shall pay such Impositions or reimburse such
          Indemnified Person for such Impositions, to the extent not previously
          paid or reimbursed pursuant to subsection (a), prior to the latest
          time permitted by the relevant taxing authority for timely payment
          after conclusion of all contests under Section 11.2(f).

               (iii) At the Indemnity Provider's request, the amount of any
          indemnification payment by the Indemnity Provider pursuant to
          subsection (a) shall be verified and certified by an independent
          public accounting firm mutually acceptable to the Indemnity Provider
          and the Indemnified Person. The fees and expenses of such independent
          public accounting firm shall be paid by the Indemnity Provider unless
          such verification shall result in an adjustment in the Indemnity
          Provider's favor of five percent (5%) or more of the payment as
          computed by the Indemnified Person, in which case such fee shall be
          paid by the Indemnified Person.

          (d) The Indemnity Provider shall be responsible for preparing and
     filing any real and personal property or ad valorem tax returns in respect
     of each Property and any other tax returns required for the Owner Trustee
     respecting the transactions described in the Operative Agreements. In case
     any other report or tax return shall be required to be made with respect to
     any obligations of the Indemnity Provider under or arising out of
     subsection (a) and of which the Indemnity Provider has knowledge or should
     have knowledge, the Indemnity Provider, at its sole cost and expense, shall
     notify the relevant Indemnified Person of such requirement and (except if
     such Indemnified Person notifies the Indemnity Provider that such
     Indemnified Person intends to prepare and file such report or return) (A)
     to the extent required or permitted by and consistent with Legal
     Requirements, make and file in the Indemnity Provider's name such return,
     statement or report; and (B) in the case of any other such return,
     statement or report required to be made in the name of such Indemnified
     Person, advise such Indemnified Person of such fact and prepare such
     return, statement or report for filing by such Indemnified Person or, where
     such return, statement or report shall be required to reflect items in
     addition to any obligations of the Indemnity Provider under or arising out
     of subsection (a), provide such Indemnified Person at the Indemnity
     Provider's expense with information sufficient to permit such return,
     statement or report to be properly made with respect to any obligations of
     the Indemnity Provider under or arising out of subsection (a). Such
     Indemnified Person shall, upon the Indemnity Provider's request and at the
     Indemnity Provider's expense, provide any data maintained by such
     Indemnified Person (and not otherwise available to or within the control of
     the Indemnity Provider) with respect to each Property which the Indemnity
     Provider may reasonably require to prepare any required tax returns or
     reports. If an Indemnified Person or an Affiliate receives notification
     from a taxing authority having jurisdiction over the Indemnified Person or
     any Property that an Imposition has been or will be imposed or a filing is
     required in connection therewith for which indemnification is required to
     be provided by the Indemnity Provider hereunder, then such Indemnified
     Person shall provide prompt written notice thereof to the Indemnity
     Provider; provided, however, the failure of the Indemnified Person to
     provide any such notice shall not relieve the Indemnity Provider of

                                       48

<PAGE>

     its obligations hereunder except to the extent that the failure by the
     Indemnified Person to provide such notice actually expands the obligations
     (including any increase in the amount of any indemnity) of the Indemnity
     Provider hereunder.

     If an Indemnified Person or an Affiliate with whom such Indemnified Person
     files a consolidated tax return, or equivalent, subsequently receives the
     refund of an amount indemnified hereunder, then, so long as no Event of
     Default shall exist and be continuing, such Indemnified Person shall pay
     the amount of such refund, together with the amount of interest actually
     received thereon, if any, to the Indemnity Provider; provided, however, if
     any refund or other amount shall ever be subject to reclaim or otherwise be
     required to be returned or repaid to the applicable taxing authority that
     issued such refund, then the amount subject to the reclaim or otherwise
     required to be repaid to such tax authority shall be deemed to be an
     Imposition for which Indemnity Provider shall be responsible to indemnify
     and hold harmless such Indemnified Person.

          (e) As between the Indemnity Provider on one hand, and each Financing
     Party on the other hand, the Indemnity Provider shall be responsible for,
     and the Indemnity Provider shall indemnify and hold harmless each Financing
     Party (without duplication of any indemnification required by subsection
     (a)) on an After Tax Basis against, any obligation for United States or
     foreign withholding taxes or similar levies, imposts, charges, fees,
     deductions or withholdings (collectively, "Withholdings") imposed in
     respect of the interest payable on the Notes, Holder Yield payable on the
     Certificates or with respect to any other payments under the Operative
     Agreements to the extent that any such Withholdings arise as a result of
     the change of the principal place of business, chief executive office or
     other location or office of the Indemnity Provider or otherwise arise as a
     result of acts of the Indemnity Provider (as opposed, for example, to
     Withholdings arising from the location of the lending office of any
     Financing Party or any change thereof).

          (f) If a written Claim is made against any Indemnified Person or if
     any proceeding shall be commenced against such Indemnified Person
     (including without limitation a written notice of such proceeding), for any
     Impositions, the provisions in Section 11.1 relating to notification and
     rights to contest shall apply; provided, however, that the Indemnity
     Provider shall have the right to conduct and control such contest only if
     such contest involves a Tax other than a Tax on net income of the
     Indemnified Person and can be pursued independently from any other
     proceeding involving a Tax liability of such Indemnified Person; provided,
     further where the Indemnified Person controls any contest, it agrees to
     consult in good faith with the Indemnity Provider and shall keep the
     Indemnity Provider reasonably informed as to the conduct of the response to
     such Claim.

     11.3. Increased Costs, Illegality, etc.

          Subject to and limited by in all respects the provisions of this
     Section 11.3 and Sections 11.6 through 11.8:

                                       49

<PAGE>

          (a)(i) If any change in Law shall:

               (A) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special
     deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the
     account of, or credit extended by, any Financing Party (except any such
     reserve requirement reflected in the Eurodollar Rate plus the Applicable
     Percentage); or

               (B) impose on any Financing Party or the London interbank market
     any other condition affecting this Agreement or any other Operative
     Agreement or Eurodollar Loans, Eurodollar Holder Advances, ABR Loans or ABR
     Holder Advances made by such Financing Party;

and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such
Financing Party of making or maintaining any Eurodollar Loan, Eurodollar Holder
Advance, ABR Loan or ABR Holder Advance (or of maintaining its obligation to
make any such Loan or Holder Advance) or to reduce the amount of any sum
received or receivable by such Financing Party hereunder or pursuant to any
other Operative Agreement (whether of principal, interest, Holder Yield or
otherwise), then the Lessee will pay or cause to be paid to such Financing Party
such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Financing Party for
such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.

                    (ii) If any Financing Party determines that any change in
     Law regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing
     the rate of return on such Financing Party's capital or on the capital of
     such Financing Party's holding company, if any, as a consequence of this
     Agreement or any other Operative Agreement or the Loans or Holder Advances
     made by, such Financing Party to a level below that which such Financing
     Party or such Financing Party's holding company could have achieved but for
     such change in Law (taking into consideration such Financing Party's
     policies and the policies of such Financing Party's holding company with
     respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Lessee will pay or
     cause to be paid to such Financing Party such additional amount or amounts
     as will compensate such Financing Party or such Financing Party's holding
     company for any such reduction suffered.

                    (iii) A certificate of a Financing Party setting forth in
     reasonable detail the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such
     Financing Party or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in
     paragraphs (a)(i) or (a)(ii) of this Section 11.3 shall be delivered to the
     Lessee and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Lessee shall pay
     or cause to be paid to such Financing Party the amount shown as due on any
     such certificate within ten (10) days after receipt thereof.

                    (iv) Failure or delay on the part of any Financing Party to
     demand compensation pursuant to this Section 11.3 shall not constitute a
     waiver of such Financing Party's right to demand such compensation;
     provided, that the

                                       50

<PAGE>

     Lessee shall not be required to compensate or cause to be compensated a
     Financing Party pursuant to this Section 11.3 for any increased costs or
     reductions incurred more than 270 days prior to the date that such
     Financing Party notifies the Lessee of the change in Law giving rise to
     such increased costs or reductions and of such Financing Party's intention
     to claim compensation therefor; provided, further, that, if the change in
     Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then
     the 270-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the
     period of retroactive effect thereof.

          (b) If any Financing Party determines that compliance with any law or
     regulation or any guideline or request from any central bank or other
     governmental authority (whether or not having the force of law, but in each
     case promulgated or made after the date hereof) affects or would affect the
     amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by such Financing
     Party or any corporation controlling such Financing Party and that the
     amount of such capital is increased by or based upon the existence of such
     Financing Party's commitment to make Advances and other commitments of this
     type or upon the Advances, then, upon demand by such Financing Party (with
     a copy of such demand to the Agent but subject to the terms of Section 2.11
     of the Credit Agreement and 3.9 of the Trust Agreement), the Lessee shall
     pay to the Agent for the account of such Financing Party, from time to time
     as specified by such Financing Party, additional amounts sufficient to
     compensate such Financing Party or such corporation in the light of such
     circumstances, to the extent that such Financing Party reasonably
     determines such increase in capital to be allocable to the existence of
     such Financing Party's commitment to make such Advances. A certificate as
     to such amounts submitted to the Lessee and the Agent by such Financing
     Party shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest
     error.

          (c) Without limiting the effect of the foregoing, the Lessee shall pay
     to each Financing Party on the last day of the Interest Period therefor so
     long as such Financing Party is maintaining reserves against "Eurocurrency
     liabilities" under Regulation D an additional amount (determined by such
     Financing Party and notified to the Lessee through the Agent) equal to the
     product of the following for each Eurodollar Loan or Eurodollar Holder
     Advance, as the case may be, for each day during such Interest Period:

               (i) the principal amount of such Eurodollar Loan or Eurodollar
          Holder Advance, as the case may be, outstanding on such day; and

               (ii) the remainder of (x) a fraction the numerator of which is
          the rate (expressed as a decimal) at which interest accrues on such
          Eurodollar Loan or Eurodollar Holder Advance, as the case may be, for
          such Interest Period as provided in the Credit Agreement or the Trust
          Agreement, as the case may be (less the Applicable Percentage), and
          the denominator of which is one (1) minus the effective rate
          (expressed as a decimal) at which such reserve requirements are
          imposed on such Financing Party on such day minus (y) such numerator;
          and

                                       51

<PAGE>

               (iii) 1/360.

          (d) Without affecting its rights under Sections 11.3(a), 11.3(b) or
     11.3(c) or any other provision of any Operative Agreement, each Financing
     Party agrees that if there is any increase in any cost to or reduction in
     any amount receivable by such Financing Party with respect to which the
     Lessee would be obligated to compensate such Financing Party pursuant to
     Sections 11.3(a) or 11.3(b), such Financing Party shall use reasonable
     efforts to select an alternative office for Advances which would not result
     in any such increase in any cost to or reduction in any amount receivable
     by such Financing Party; provided, however, that no Financing Party shall
     be obligated to select an alternative office for Advances if such Financing
     Party determines that (i) as a result of such selection such Financing
     Party would be in violation of any applicable law, regulation, treaty, or
     guideline, or would incur additional costs or expenses or (ii) such
     selection would be inadvisable for regulatory reasons or materially
     inconsistent with the interests of such Financing Party.

          (e) With reference to the obligations of the Lessee set forth in
     Sections 11.3(a) through 11.3(d), the Lessee shall not have any obligation
     to pay to any Financing Party amounts owing under such Sections for any
     period which is more than one (1) year prior to the date upon which the
     request for payment therefor is delivered to the Lessee.

          (f) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if any
     Financing Party shall notify the Agent that the introduction of or any
     change in or in the interpretation of any law or regulation makes it
     unlawful, or any central bank or other governmental authority asserts that
     it is unlawful, for any Financing Party to perform its obligations
     hereunder to make or maintain Eurodollar Loans or Eurodollar Holder
     Advances, as the case may be, then (i) each Eurodollar Loan or Eurodollar
     Holder Advance, as the case may be, will automatically, at the earlier of
     the end of the Interest Period for such Eurodollar Loan or Eurodollar
     Holder Advance, as the case may be, or the date required by law, convert
     into an ABR Loan or an ABR Holder Advance, as the case may be, and (iii)
     the obligation of the Financing Parties to make, convert or continue
     Eurodollar Loans or Eurodollar Holder Advances, as the case may be, shall
     be suspended until the Agent shall notify the Lessee that such Financing
     Party has determined that the circumstances causing such suspension no
     longer exist.

     11.4. Funding/Contribution Indemnity.

     Subject to and limited by in all respects the provisions of this Section
11.4 and Sections 11.6 through 11.8 and further subject to the provisions of
Section 2.11(a) of the Credit Agreement and 3.9(a) of the Trust Agreement, as
the case may be, the Lessee agrees to indemnify each Financing Party and to hold
each Financing Party harmless from any loss or reasonable expense which such
Financing Party may sustain or incur as a consequence of (a) any default in
connection with the drawing of funds for any Advance, (b) any default in making
any prepayment after a notice thereof has been given in accordance with the
provisions of the Operative Agreements or (c) the making of a voluntary or
involuntary prepayment of Eurodollar Loans or

                                       52

<PAGE>

Eurodollar Holder Advances, as the case may be, on a day which is not the last
day of an Interest Period with respect thereto. Such indemnification shall be in
an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (x) the amount of interest or Holder
Yield, as the case may be, which would have accrued on the amount so prepaid, or
not so borrowed, accepted, converted or continued for the period from the date
of such prepayment or of such failure to borrow, accept, convert or continue to
the last day of such Interest Period (or, in the case of a failure to borrow,
accept, convert or continue, the Interest Period that would have commenced on
the date of such failure) in each case at the applicable Eurodollar Rate plus
the Applicable Percentage for such Loan or Holder Advance, as the case may be,
for such Interest Period over (y) the amount of interest (as determined by such
Financing Party in its reasonable discretion) which would have accrued to such
Financing Party on such amount by (i) (in the case of the Lenders) reemploying
such funds in loans of the same type and amount during the period from the date
of prepayment or failure to borrow to the last day of the then applicable
Interest Period (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, the Interest Period
that would have commenced on the date of such failure) and (ii) (in the case of
the Holders) placing such amount on deposit for a comparable period with leading
banks in the relevant interest rate market. This covenant shall survive the
termination of the Operative Agreements and the payment of all other amounts
payable hereunder.

     11.5. [Intentionally Omitted]

     11.6. Additional Provisions Regarding Environmental Indemnification.

     Subject to and limited by in all respects the provisions of this Section
11.6 and Sections 11.7 and 11.8, each and every Indemnified Person shall at all
times have the rights and benefits, and the Indemnity Provider shall have the
obligations, in each case provided pursuant to the Operative Agreements with
respect to Environmental Matters (including without limitation the rights and
benefits provided pursuant to Section 11.1(c).

     11.7. Additional Provisions Regarding Indemnification; Cooperation with the
           Indemnity Provider.

     Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 11.1, 11.2, 11.3, 11.4 and 11.6
and solely for the period prior to the earlier to occur of the applicable
Completion Date or Construction Period Termination Date for each Property, as
applicable, (a) the Indemnity Provider shall be responsible for all the
indemnity and other obligations without deduction pursuant to Sections 11.1,
11.2, 11.3 and 11.4 unless the Indemnity Provider can reasonably demonstrate
that the matter giving rise to any (i) Claim made by any Person (other than any
Financing Party), pursuant to Sections 11.1, 11.2, 11.3 or 11.4, as the case may
be, did not relate to any act or omission of any Credit Party or any other
Person acting by, through or under any Credit Party, except the Indemnity
Provider shall not be responsible for any such Claim pursuant to this Section
11.7(a)(i) arising from the failure of the Construction Agent to complete
construction of any Property prior to the applicable Construction Period
Termination Date and (ii) Claim made by any Financing Party, pursuant to
Sections 11.3 or 11.4, as the case may be, did not relate to any act or omission
of any Credit Party or any other Person acting by, through or under any Credit
Party constituting (A) fraud or misapplication of funds, (B) an illegal act or
omission or (C) willful misconduct and

                                       53

<PAGE>

(b) the Indemnity Provider shall be responsible for all the indemnity and other
obligations without deduction pursuant to Sections 11.1(c) or 11.6 unless the
Indemnity Provider can reasonably demonstrate that the Environmental Claim or
other Environmental Matter then under consideration (i) arose, came into
existence or otherwise occurred after the initial closing relating to the Bridge
Financing, (ii) represented more than a remote risk at the time of the initial
closing relating to the Bridge Financing and (iii) was not attributable to any
act or omission of any Credit Party or any other Person acting by, through or
under any Credit Party.

     Each Indemnified Person agrees to cooperate in a reasonable manner (but at
the expense of the Indemnity Provider) with the Indemnity Provider in responding
to any Claim covered by the indemnities referenced in the Operative Agreements.

     11.8. Indemnifications Provided by the Owner Trustee in Favor of the Other
           Indemnified Persons.

     To the extent the Indemnity Provider is not obligated to indemnify each
Indemnified Person with respect to the various matters described in this Section
11.8, the Owner Trustee shall provide such indemnities (but only to the extent
amounts sufficient to pay such indemnity are funded by the Lenders and the
Holders) in favor of each Indemnified Person in accordance with this Section
11.8 and shall pay all such amounts owed with respect to this Section 11.8 with
amounts advanced by the Lenders and the Holders (a) to the extent, but only to
the extent, amounts are available therefor with respect to the Available
Commitments and the Available Holder Commitments (subject to the rights of the
Lenders and the Holders to increase their respective commitment amounts in
accordance with the provisions of Section 5.13) and (b) unless each Lender and
each Holder has declined in writing to fund such amount. Notwithstanding any
other provision in any other Operative Agreement to the contrary, all amounts so
advanced shall be deemed added (ratably, based on the ratio of the Property Cost
for each Property individually to the Aggregate Property Cost of all Properties
at such time) to the Property Cost of all Properties then subject to the terms
of the Operative Agreements.

     Subject to the proviso to this paragraph, the Owner Trustee shall pay and
assume liability for, and does hereby agree to indemnify, protect and defend
each Indemnified Person from any and all matters described in Sections 11.1,
11.2, 11.3, 11.4 and/or 11.6 as if such Sections 11.1, 11.2, 11.3, 11.4 and 11.6
were incorporated herein in their entirety and the Owner Trustee were referenced
in each such Section as the Indemnity Provider, the Lessee or any other such
party obligated to provide indemnification or to pay any amount pursuant to any
such Section; provided, however, the Owner Trustee shall only provide such
indemnification and other protections referenced above in this paragraph with
respect to any Claim relating to any Property prior to the Completion of such
Property in any way relating to or arising or alleged to arise out of the
execution, delivery, performance or enforcement of this Agreement, the Lease or
any other Operative Agreement or on or with respect to such Property or any
component thereof, including without limitation any Claim in any way relating to
or arising or alleged to arise out of (a) the financing, refinancing, purchase,
ownership, design, construction, refurbishment, development, delivery,
acceptance, nondelivery, leasing, subleasing, possession, use, occupancy,
operation, maintenance repair or modification of such Property or any part
thereof; (b) any latent or other

                                       54

<PAGE>

defects in such Property or any portion thereof whether or not discoverable by
an Indemnified Person or the Indemnity Provider; (c) any Environmental Matter
relating to such Property; (d) the transactions contemplated hereby or by any
other Operative Agreement, in respect of the application of Parts 4 and 5 of
Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA; (e) personal injury, death or property damage
arising out of or relating to the construction of the Property or any part
thereof, including without limitation Claims based on strict or absolute
liability in tort; and (f) any fees, expenses and/or other assessments by any
business park or any other similar entity for such Property.

     THE INDEMNITY OBLIGATIONS UNDERTAKEN BY THE OWNER TRUSTEE PURSUANT TO THIS
SECTION 11.8 ARE IN ALL RESPECTS SUBJECT TO THE LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY
REFERENCED IN SECTION 12.9.

     11.9. Time Period in which Claims may arise and be Covered by
Indemnification.

     The basis for any Claim which is subject to indemnification coverage by the
Indemnity Provider pursuant to Sections 11.1 through 11.8 must occur or arise on
or before the Expiration Date or any earlier date upon which the Operative
Agreements are terminated, notwithstanding that any Claim may not be filed or
otherwise initiated until a date which is later than any date referenced in this
Section 11.9.

                           SECTION 12. MISCELLANEOUS.

     12.1. Survival of Agreements.

     The representations, warranties, covenants, indemnities and agreements of
the parties provided for in the Operative Agreements, and the parties'
obligations under any and all thereof, shall survive the execution and delivery
of this Agreement, the transfer of any Property to the Owner Trustee, the
acquisition of any Property (or any of its components), the construction of any
Improvements, the Completion of any Property, any disposition of any interest of
the Owner Trustee in any Property or any interest of the Holders in the Trust
Estate, the payment of the Notes and any disposition thereof and shall be and
continue in effect notwithstanding any investigation made by any party and the
fact that any party may waive compliance with any of the other terms, provisions
or conditions of any of the Operative Agreements. Except as otherwise expressly
set forth herein or in other Operative Agreements, the indemnities of the
parties provided for in the Operative Agreements shall survive the expiration or
termination of any thereof.

     12.2. Notices.

     All notices required or permitted to be given under any Operative Agreement
shall be in writing. Notices may be served by certified or registered mail,
postage paid with return receipt requested; by private courier, prepaid; by

deemed delivered when delivered as addressed, or if the addressee refuses
delivery, when presented for delivery notwithstanding such refusal. Telex or
telecommunicated notices shall be deemed delivered when receipt is either
confirmed by confirming transmission equipment or acknowledged by the addressee
or its office. Personal delivery shall be effective when accomplished. Unless a
party changes its address by giving notice to the other party as provided
herein, notices shall be delivered to the parties at the following addresses:

TO THOSE ON THE ATTACHED DISTRIBUTION LIST

     Re:  Synthetic Lease Financing Provided in favor of Convergys Corporation

Dear Sirs:

We have acted as special counsel to Convergys Corporation, an Ohio corporation
(the "Lessee"), and the various parties thereto from time to time, as guarantors
(individually, a "Guarantor" and collectively, the "Guarantors"; individually,
the Lessee and each Guarantor may be referred to herein as a "Credit Party" or
collectively, as the "Credit Parties"), in connection with certain transactions
contemplated by the Participation Agreement dated as of December 31, 1998 (the
"Participation Agreement"), among the Lessee, the Guarantors, First Security
Bank, National Association, as the Owner Trustee (the "Owner Trustee"), the
various banks and other lending institutions which are parties thereto from time
to time, as holders (the "Holders"), the various banks and other lending
institutions which are parties thereto from time to time, as lenders (the
"Lenders") and NationsBank, N.A., as the agent for the Lenders and respecting
the Security Documents, as the agent for the Lenders and the Holders, to the
extent of their interests (the "Agent"). This opinion is delivered pursuant to
Section 5.3(j) of the Participation Agreement. All capitalized terms used
herein, and not otherwise defined herein, shall have the meanings assigned
thereto in Appendix A to the Participation Agreement.

In connection with the foregoing, we have examined originals, or copies
certified to our satisfaction, of [identify the applicable Operative Agreements,
including each Mortgage Instrument, related UCC fixture filings, Additional UCCs
(hereinafter defined), Deeds and Memoranda of Lease] and such other corporate
documents and records of the Credit Parties, certificates of public officials
and representatives of the Credit Parties as to certain factual matters, and
such other instruments and documents which we have deemed necessary or advisable
to examine for the purpose of this opinion. With respect to such examination, we
have assumed (i) the statements of fact made in all such certificates, documents
and instruments are true, accurate and complete; (ii) except as to the Credit
Parties, the due authorization, execution and delivery of the Operative
Agreements by the parties thereto; (iii) the genuineness of all signatures
(except as to the Credit Parties), the authenticity and completeness of all
documents, certificates, instruments, records and corporate records submitted to
us as originals and the conformity to the original instruments of all documents
submitted to us as copies, and the

                                       B-1

<PAGE>

authenticity and completeness of the originals of such copies; (iv) except as to
the Credit Parties, that all parties have all requisite corporate power and
authority to execute, deliver and perform the Operative Agreements; and (v)
except as to the Credit Parties, the enforceability of the Mortgage Instrument,
the Memorandum of Lease and the UCC financing statements against all parties
thereto.

Based on the foregoing, and having due regard for such legal considerations as
we deem relevant, and subject to the limitations and assumptions set forth
herein, including without limitation the matters set forth in the last two (2)
paragraphs hereof, we are of the opinion that:

     (a) The Mortgage Instrument and Memorandum of Lease are enforceable in
accordance with their respective terms, except as limited by laws generally
affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights, which laws will not materially
prevent the realization of the benefits intended by such documents.

     (b) Each form of Mortgage Instrument and UCC fixture filing relating
thereto, attached hereto as Schedules 1 and 2, respectively, is in proper form
for filing and recording with the offices of [identify the recording offices of
the respective county clerks where the Properties are to be located]. Upon
filing of each Mortgage Instrument and UCC fixture filing in [identify the
recording offices of the respective county clerks where the Properties are to be
located], the Agent will have a valid, perfected lien and security interest in
that portion of the Collateral described in such Mortgage Instrument or UCC
fixture filing to the extent such Collateral is comprised of real property
and/or fixtures.

     (c) The forms of UCC financing statements relating to the Security
Documents, attached hereto as Schedule 3 (the "Additional UCCs"), are in proper
form for filing and recording with the offices of [identify (i) the recording
offices of the respective county clerks where the Properties are to be located
and (ii) the Secretary of State where the Properties are to be located]. Upon
filing of the Additional UCCs in [identify (i) the recording offices of the
respective county clerks where the Properties are to be located and (ii) the
Secretary of State where the Properties are to be located], the Agent will have
a valid, perfected lien and security interest in that portion of the Collateral
which can be perfected by filing UCC-1 financing statements under Article 9 of
the UCC.

     (d) Each form of Deed and Memorandum of Lease is in appropriate form for
filing and recording with the [identify the recording offices of the respective
county clerks for the counties where the Properties are to be located].

     (e) Each Memorandum of Lease, when filed and recorded with the [identify
the recording offices of the respective county clerks for the counties where the
Properties are to be located], will have been filed and recorded in all public
offices in the State of [__________] in which filing or recording is necessary
to provide constructive notice of the Lease to third Persons and to establish of
record the interest of the Lessor thereunder as to the Properties described in
each such Memorandum of Lease.

                                       B-2

<PAGE>

     (f) Title to the Properties located in the State of [___________] may be
held in the name of the Owner Trustee as follows: First Security Bank, National
Association, not individually, but solely as the Owner Trustee under the CRT
Realty Trust 1998-1.

     (g) The execution and delivery by First Security Bank, National
Association, individually or as the Owner Trustee, as the case may be, of the
Operative Agreements to which it is a party and compliance by First Security
Bank, National Association, individually or as the Owner Trustee, with all of
the provisions thereof do not and will not contravene any law, rule or
regulation of [identify the state].

     (h) By reason of their participation in the transaction contemplated under
the Operative Agreements, none of the Agent, the Lenders, the Holders or the
Owner Trustee has to (a) qualify as a foreign corporation in [identify the
state], (b) file any application or any designation for service of process in
[identify the state] or (c) pay any franchise, income, sales, excise, stamp or
other taxes of any kind to [identify the state].

     (i) The provisions in the Operative Agreements concerning Rent, interest,
fees, prepayment premiums and other similar charges do not violate the usury
laws or other similar laws regulating the use or forbearance of money of
[identify the state].

     (j) If the transactions contemplated by the Operative Agreements are
characterized as a lease transaction by a court of competent jurisdiction, the
Lease and the applicable Lease Supplement shall demise to the Lessee a valid
leasehold interest in the Properties described in such Lease Supplement.

     (k) If the transactions contemplated by the Operative Agreements are
characterized as a loan transaction by a court of competent jurisdiction, the
combination of the Mortgage Instruments, the Deeds, the Lease and the applicable
Lease Supplements (and the other Operative Agreements incorporated therein by
reference) are sufficient to create a valid, perfected lien or security interest
in the Properties therein described, enforceable as a mortgage in [identify the
state].

This opinion is limited to the matters stated herein and no opinion is implied
or may be inferred beyond the matters stated herein. This opinion is based on
and is limited to the laws of the State of [___________] and the federal laws of
the United States of America. Insofar as the foregoing opinion relates to
matters of law other than the foregoing, no opinion is hereby given.

                                       B-3

This opinion is for the sole benefit of the Lessee, the Construction Agent, the
Guarantors, the Owner Trustee, the Holders, the Lenders, the Agent and their
respective successors and assigns and may not be relied upon by any other person
other than such parties and their respective successors and assigns without the
express written consent of the undersigned. The opinions expressed herein are as
of the date hereof and we make no undertaking to amend or supplement such
opinions if facts come to our attention or changes in the current law of the
jurisdictions mentioned herein occur which could affect such opinions.

          the actions of all officers, employees, and committees utilized by the
          Bank in the exercise of its fiduciary powers, are the responsibility
          of the board. In discharging this responsibility, the board of
          directors may assign, by action duly entered in the minutes, the
          administration of such of the Bank's fiduciary powers as it may
          consider proper to assign to such director(s), officer(s), employee(s)
          or committee(s) as it may designate.

     (2)  No fiduciary account shall be accepted without the prior approval of
          the board, or of the director(s), officer(s), or committee(s) to whom
          the board may have designated the performance of that responsibility..
          ..

     6. A Resolution relating to Exercise of Fiduciary Powers was adopted by the
Board of Directors at a meeting held July 26, 1994 at which time there was a
quorum present; said resolution is still in full force and effect and has not
been rescinded. Said resolution is attached hereto as Schedule C and
incorporated herein by reference.

                       (Pursuant to Section 5.3(ee) of the
                            Participation Agreement)

                            ___________ _____, 1998

TO THOSE ON THE ATTACHED DISTRIBUTION LIST

     Re: Amended and Restated Trust Agreement dated as of December 31, 1998

Dear Sirs:

     We have acted as special counsel for First Security Bank, National
Association, a national banking association, in its individual capacity ("FSB")
and in its capacity as trustee (the "Owner Trustee") under the Amended and
Restated Trust Agreement dated as of December 31, 1998 (the "Trust Agreement"),
by and among it and the various banks and other lending institutions which are
parties thereto from time to time, as holders (the "Holders"), in connection
with the execution and delivery by the Owner Trustee of the Operative Agreements
to which it is a party. Except as otherwise defined herein, the terms used
herein shall have the meanings set forth in Appendix A to the Participation
Agreement dated as of December 31,1998 (the "Participation Agreement") by and
among Convergys Corporation (the "Lessee"), the various parties thereto from
time to time, as guarantors (the "Guarantors"), First Security Bank, National
Association, as the Owner Trustee, the Holders, the various banks and other
lending institutions which are parties thereto from time to time, as lenders
(the "Lenders") and NationsBank, N.A., as the agent for the Lenders and
respecting the Security Documents, as the agent for the Lenders and the Holders,
to the extent of their interests (the "Agent").

     We have examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to
our satisfaction, of such documents, corporate records and other instruments as
we have deemed necessary or advisable for the purpose of rendering this opinion.

Based upon the foregoing, we are of the opinion that:

     1. FSB is a national banking association duly organized, validly existing
and in good standing under the laws of the United States of America and each of
FSB and the Owner Trustee has under the laws of the State of Utah and federal
banking law the power and authority to enter into and perform its obligations
under the Trust Agreement and each other Operative Agreement to which it is a
party.

     2. The Owner Trustee is the duly appointed trustee under the Trust
Agreement.

                                       G-1

<PAGE>

     3. The Trust Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by
one (1) of the officers of FSB and, assuming due authorization, execution and
delivery by the Holders, is a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Owner
Trustee (and to the extent set forth therein, against FSB), enforceable against
the Owner Trustee (and to the extent set forth therein, against FSB) in
accordance with its terms, and the Trust Agreement creates under the laws of the
State of Utah for the Holders the beneficial interest in the Trust Estate it
purports to create and is a valid trust under the laws of the State of Utah.

     4. The Operative Agreements to which it is party have been duly authorized,
executed and delivered by FSB, and, assuming due authorization, execution and
delivery by the other parties thereto, are legal, valid and binding obligations
of FSB, enforceable against FSB in accordance with their respective terms.

     5. The Operative Agreements to which it is party have been duly authorized,
executed and delivered by the Owner Trustee, and, assuming due authorization,
execution and delivery by the other parties thereto, are legal, valid and
binding obligations of the Owner Trustee, enforceable against the Owner Trustee
in accordance with their respective terms. The Notes and Certificates have been
duly issued, executed and delivered by the Owner Trustee, pursuant to
authorization contained in the Trust Agreement, and the Certificates are
entitled to the benefits and security afforded by the Trust Agreement in
accordance with its terms and the terms of the Trust Agreement.

     6. The execution and delivery by each of FSB and the Owner Trustee of the
Trust Agreement and the Operative Agreements to which it is a party, and
compliance by FSB or the Owner Trustee, as the case may be, with all of the
provisions thereof do not and will not contravene any Laws applicable to or
binding on FSB, or as the Owner Trustee, or contravene the provisions of, or
constitute a default under, its charter documents or by-laws or, to our
knowledge after due inquiry, any indenture, mortgage contract or other agreement
or instrument to which FSB or Owner Trustee is a party or by which it or any of
its property may be bound or affected.

     7. The execution and delivery of the Operative Agreements by each of FSB
and the Owner Trustee and the performance by each of FSB and the Owner Trustee
of their respective obligations thereunder does not require on or prior to the
date hereof the consent or approval of, the giving of notice to, the
registration or filing with, or the taking of any action in respect of any
Governmental Authority or any court.

     8. Assuming that the trust created by the Trust Agreement is treated as a
grantor trust for federal income tax purposes within the contemplation of
Section 671 through 678 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, there are no fees,
taxes, or other charges (except taxes imposed on fees payable to the Owner
Trustee) payable to the State of Utah or any political subdivision thereof in
connection with the execution, delivery or performance by the Owner Trustee, the
Agent, the Lenders, the Lessee or the Holders, as the case may be, of the
Operative Agreements or in connection with the acquisition of any Property by
the Owner Trustee or in connection with the making by any Holder of its
investment in the Trust or its acquisition of the beneficial interest

                                       G-2

<PAGE>

in the Trust Estate or in connection with the issuance and acquisition of the
Certificates, or the Notes, and neither the Owner Trustee, the Trust Estate nor
the trust created by the Trust Agreement will be subject to any fee, tax or
other governmental charge (except taxes on fees payable to the Owner Trustee)
under the laws of the State of Utah or any political subdivision thereof on,
based on or measured by, directly or indirectly, the gross receipts, net income
or value of the Trust Estate by reason of the creation or continued existence of
the trust under the terms of the Trust Agreement pursuant to the laws of the
State of Utah or the Owner Trustee's performance of its duties under the Trust
Agreement.

     9. There is no fee, tax or other governmental charge under the laws of the
State of Utah or any political subdivision thereof in existence on the date
hereof on, based on or measured by any payments under the Certificates, Notes or
the beneficial interest in the Trust Estate, by reason of the creation of the
trust under the Trust Agreement pursuant to the laws of the State of Utah or the
Owner Trustee's performance of its duties under the Trust Agreement within the
State of Utah.

     10. Upon the filing of the financing statement on form UCC-1 in the form
attached hereto as Schedule 1 with the Utah Division of Corporation and
Commercial Code, the Agent's security interest in the Trust Estate, for the
benefit of the Lenders and the Holders, will be perfected, to the extent that
such perfection is governed by Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code as in
effect in the State of Utah (the "Utah UCC").

     Your attention is directed to the Utah UCC, which provides, in part, that a
filed financing statement which does not state a maturity date or which states a
maturity date of more than five (5) years is effective only for a period of five
(5) years from the date of filing, unless within six (6) months prior to the
expiration of said period a continuation statement is filed in the same office
or offices in which the original statement was filed. The continuation statement
must be signed by the secured party, identify the original statement by file
number and state that the original statement is still effective. Upon the timely
filing of a continuation statement, the effectiveness of the original financing
statement is continued for five (5) years after the last date to which the
original statement was effective. Succeeding continuation statements may be
filed in the same manner to continue the effectiveness of the original
statement.

The foregoing opinions are subject to the following assumptions, exceptions and
qualifications:

     A. We are attorneys admitted to practice in the State of Utah and in
rendering the foregoing opinions we have not passed upon, or purported to pass
upon, the laws of any jurisdictions other than the State of Utah and the federal
banking law governing the banking and trust powers of FSB. In addition, without
limiting the foregoing we express no opinion with respect to (i) federal
securities laws, including the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Trust Indenture Act of
1939, as amended, (ii) the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended, (iii) the
Federal Communications Act of 1934, as amended, or (iv) state securities or blue
sky laws. Insofar as the foregoing opinions relate to the legality, validity,
binding effect and enforceability of the documents involved in these
transactions, which by their terms are governed by the laws of a state other
than Utah, we have

                                       G-3

<PAGE>

assumed that the laws of such state (as to which we express no opinion), are in
all material aspects identical to the laws of the State of Utah.

     B. The opinions set forth in paragraphs 3, 4, and 5 above are subject to
the qualification that enforceability of the Trust Agreement and the other
Operative Agreements to which FSB and the Owner Trustee are parties, in
accordance with their respective terms, may be limited by (i) bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, receivership or similar laws affecting
enforcement of creditors' rights generally, and (ii) general principles of
equity, regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding
in equity or at law.

     C. As to the documents involved in these transactions, we have assumed that
each is a legal, valid and binding obligation of each party thereto, other than
FSB or the Owner Trustee, and is enforceable against each such party in
accordance with their respective terms.

     D. We have assumed that all signatures, other than those of the Owner
Trustee or FSB, on documents and instruments involved in these transactions are
genuine, that all documents and instruments submitted to us as originals are
authentic, and that all documents and instruments submitted to us as copies
conform with the originals, which facts we have not independently verified.

     E. We do not purport to be experts in respect of, or express any opinion
concerning laws, rules or regulations applicable to the particular nature of the
equipment or property involved in these transactions.

     F. We have made no investigation of, and we express no opinion concerning,
the nature of the title to any part of the equipment or property involved in
these transactions or the priority of any mortgage or security interest.

     G. We have assumed that the Participation Agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby are not within the prohibitions of Section 406 of the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.

     H. In addition to any other limitation by operation of law upon the scope,
meaning, or purpose of this opinion, the opinions expressed herein speak only as
of the date hereof. We have no obligation to advise the recipients of this
opinion (or any third party) and make no undertaking to amend or supplement such
opinions if facts come to our attention or changes in the current law of the
jurisdictions mentioned herein occur which could affect such opinions the legal
analysis, a legal conclusion or any information confirmation herein.

     I. This opinion is for the sole benefit of the Lessee, the Construction
Agent, the Guarantors, the Owner Trustee, the Holders, the Lenders, the Agent
and their respective successors and assigns in matters directly related to the
Participation Agreement or the transaction contemplated thereunder and may not
be relied upon by any other person other than such parties and their respective
successors and assigns without the express written consent of

                                       G-4

the undersigned. The opinions expressed in this letter are limited to the matter
set forth in this letter, and no other opinions should be inferred beyond the
matters expressly stated.

                                                          Very truly yours,

                                                          RAY, QUINNEY & NEBEKER

TO THOSE ON THE ATTACHED DISTRIBUTION LIST

     Re: Synthetic Lease Financing Provided in favor of Convergys Corporation

Dear Sirs:

We have acted as special counsel to Convergys Corporation, an Ohio corporation
(the "Lessee") and the Guarantors (hereinafter defined) in connection with
certain transactions contemplated by the Participation Agreement dated as of
December 31, 1998 (the "Participation Agreement"), among the Lessee, the various
parties thereto from time to time, as guarantors (the "Guarantors"), First
Security Bank, National Association, as the Owner Trustee (the "Owner Trustee"),
the various banks and other lending institutions which are parties thereto from
time to time, as holders (the "Holders"), the various banks and other lending
institutions which are parties thereto from time to time, as lenders (the
"Lenders") and NationsBank, N.A., as the agent for the Lenders and respecting
the Security Documents, as the agent for the Lenders and the Holders, to the
extent of their interests (the "Agent"). This opinion is delivered pursuant to
Section 5.3(ff) of the Participation Agreement. All capitalized terms used
herein, and not otherwise defined herein, shall have the meanings assigned
thereto in Appendix A to the Participation Agreement.

In connection with the foregoing, we have examined originals, or copies
certified to our satisfaction, of the Operative Agreements, and such other
corporate, partnership or limited liability company documents and records of the
Credit Parties, certificates of public officials and representatives of the
Credit Parties as to certain factual matters, and such other instruments and
documents which we have deemed necessary or advisable to examine for the purpose
of this opinion. With respect to such examination, we have assumed (i) the
statements of fact made in all such certificates, documents and instruments are
true, accurate and complete; (ii) the due authorization, execution and delivery
of the Operative Agreements by the parties thereto other than the Credit
Parties; (iii) the genuineness of all signatures (other than the signatures of
persons signing on behalf of the Credit Parties), the authenticity and
completeness of all documents, certificates, instruments, records and corporate
records submitted to us as originals and the conformity to the original
instruments of all documents submitted to us as copies, and the authenticity and
completeness of the originals of such copies; (iv) that all parties other than
the Credit Parties have all requisite corporate power and authority to execute,
deliver and perform the Operative Agreements; and (v) the enforceability of the
Operative Agreements against all

                                       H-1

<PAGE>

parties thereto other than the Credit Parties and respecting the opinion set
forth below in section (i), First Security Bank, National Association,
individually or as the Owner Trustee, as the case may be. We have further
assumed that the laws of the States of [state of lawyer's admission] and
[governing law of Participation Agreement] are substantively identical.

Based on the foregoing, and having due regard for such legal considerations as
we deem relevant, and subject to the limitations and assumptions set forth
herein, including without limitation the matters set forth in the last two (2)
paragraphs hereof, we are of the opinion that:

     (a) Each Credit Party is a [corporation, partnership or limited liability
company] duly [incorporated or organized], validly existing and in good standing
under the laws of the state of its [incorporation/formation] and has the power
and authority to conduct its business as presently conducted and to execute,
deliver and perform its obligations under the Operative Agreements to which it
is a party. Each Credit Party is duly qualified to do business in all
jurisdictions in which its failure to so qualify would materially impair its
ability to perform its obligations under the Operative Agreements to which it is
a party or its financial position or its business as now and now proposed to be
conducted.

     (b) The execution, delivery and performance by each Credit Party of the
Operative Agreements to which it is a party have been duly authorized by all
necessary [corporate] action on the part of each Credit Party and the Operative
Agreements to which each Credit Party is a party have been duly executed and
delivered by each Credit Party.

     (c) The Operative Agreements to which each Credit Party is a party
constitute valid and binding obligations of each Credit Party enforceable
against each Credit Party in accordance with the terms thereof, subject to
bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance, and
similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally, and general principles of
equity (regardless of whether the application of such principles is considered
in a proceeding in equity or at law).

     (d) The execution and delivery by each Credit Party of the Operative
Agreements to which it is a party and compliance by each Credit Party with all
of the provisions thereof do not and will not (i) contravene the provisions of,
or result in any breach of or constitute any default under, or result in the
creation of any Lien (other than Permitted Liens and Lessor Liens) upon any of
its property under, its [Articles of Incorporation By-Laws, operating agreement,
partnership agreement or other similar document of formation] or any indenture,
mortgage, chattel mortgage, deed of trust, lease, conditional sales contract,
bank loan or credit agreement or other agreement or instrument to which any
Credit Party is a party or by which any Credit Party or any property of any
Credit Party may be bound or affected, or (ii) contravene any Laws or any order
of any Governmental Authority applicable to or binding on any Credit Party.

     (e) No Governmental Action by, and no notice to or filing with, any
Governmental Authority is required for the due execution, delivery or
performance by any Credit Party of any of the Operative Agreements to which any
Credit Party is a party or for the acquisition, ownership, construction and
completion of the Properties, except for those which have been obtained.

                                       H-2

<PAGE>

     (f) Except as set forth on Schedule 1 hereto, there are no actions, suits
or proceedings pending or to our knowledge, threatened against any Credit Party
in any court or before any Governmental Authority, that concern the Properties
or the interest of any Credit Party therein or that question the validity or
enforceability of any Operative Agreement to which any Credit Party is a party
or the overall transaction described in the Operative Agreements to which any
Credit Party is a party.

     (g) Neither the nature of the Properties, nor any relationship between any
Credit Party and any other Person, nor any circumstance in connection with the
execution, delivery and performance of the Operative Agreements to which any
Credit Party is a party is such as to require any approval of stockholders of,
or approval or consent of any trustee or holders of indebtedness of, any Credit
Party, except for such approvals and consents which have been duly obtained and
are in full force and effect.

     (h) The Security Documents which have been executed and delivered as of the
date of this opinion create, for the benefit of the Agent, the security
interests in the Collateral described therein which by their terms such Security
Documents purport to create. Upon filing of the UCC-1 financing statements
(attached hereto as Schedule 2) relating to the Security Documents in the
recording offices of (A) the respective county clerk where the principal place
of business of the Lessee is located and (B) the Secretary of State where the

</TABLE>

     For purposes of the foregoing, (i) if either Moody's or S&P shall not have
in effect a Senior Debt Rating (other than by reason of the circumstances
referred to in the last sentence of this definition), then such rating agency
shall be deemed to have established a rating at Level IV; (ii) if the ratings
established or deemed to have been established by Moody's and S&P for the Senior
Debt Rating shall fall within different Levels, then (A) if both such ratings
are at or above Level III, the Applicable Percentage shall be based on the
higher of the two ratings unless one of the two ratings is two or more Levels
lower than the other, in which case the Applicable Percentage shall be
determined by reference to the Level next above that of the lower of the two
ratings and (B) if one or both of such ratings is below Level III, the
Applicable Percentage shall be determined by reference to the lower of the two
ratings and (iii) if the ratings established or deemed to have been established
by Moody's and S&P for the Senior Debt Rating shall be changed (other than as a
result of a change in the rating system of Moody's or S&P), such change shall be
effective as of the date on which it is first announced by the applicable rating
agency. Each change in the Applicable Percentage shall apply during the period
commencing on the effective date of such change and ending on the date
immediately preceding the effective date of the next such change. If the rating
system of Moody's or S&P shall change, or if either such rating agency shall
cease to be in the business of rating corporate debt obligations, the Lessee,
the Lenders and the Holders shall negotiate in good faith to amend this
definition to reflect such changed rating system or the unavailability of
ratings from such rating agency and, pending the effectiveness of any such
amendment, the Applicable Percentage shall be determined by reference to the
rating most recently in effect prior to such change or cessation. Any adjustment
in the Applicable Percentage shall be applicable to all existing Eurodollar
Loans, Eurodollar Holder Advances and the Facility Fee as well as any new
Eurodollar Loans and Eurodollar Holder Advances made or issued.

delivered in connection with the Participation Agreement or in accordance with

Agent, complies with all of the provisions of the Financial Institutions Reform,
Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989, as amended, the rules and regulations
adopted pursuant thereto, and all other applicable Legal Requirements.
