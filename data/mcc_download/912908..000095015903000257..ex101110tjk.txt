                         SEVERANCE AGREEMENT AND RELEASE
                         -------------------------------

         THIS SEVERANCE AGREEMENT and RELEASE ("Agreement") is entered into
between Theodore Kall ("the Executive') and Foamex International Inc., Foamex
L.P., Foamex Carpet Cushion L.L.C. and all other affiliates and subsidiaries of
Foamex International Inc. (collectively "Foamex"). The Executive and Foamex are
entering into this Agreement because the Executive's employment with Foamex is
terminating and the parties (a) wish to define the terms of the Executive's
separation from employment, and (b) wish to amicably resolve any and all claims
and disputes which have been (or could have been) asserted by the Executive
against Foamex. The Executive and Foamex agree that termination of the
Executive's employment is for legitimate business reasons. This Agreement will
supercede any previous Agreements between the parties, except as otherwise set
forth in this Agreement.

Specific terms and conditions:

     1 Termination  of  Employment.  The  Executive's  last day of work shall be
November 8, 2002, which shall be defined as the "Termination Date".

     2 Severance Payment.
       -----------------

Executive shall receive a sum of Four Hundred Thousand Dollars ($400,000), to be
paid in equal amounts in accordance with Foamex's normal payroll practices,
minus withholding for federal, state, and local taxes, for a period of one year,
from November 9, 2002 through November 8, 2003.

     3 Supplemental Benefits. For a twelve (12) month period beginning on the
Termination Date, the Executive also will receive continued medical and dental
coverage consistent with that available to Foamex employees which he would be
otherwise entitled under COBRA. The Executive will be required only to make the
normal employee contribution to medical benefits on a monthly basis during this
period. Thereafter, the Executive will be eligible to continue medical and
dental coverage pursuant to COBRA at his own expense for a period of 18 months.
All other benefits will terminate on the Termination Date.

     4 Stock Options. Subject to separate approval of this provision concerning
stock options by the Compensation and Organization Committee of the Foamex Board
of Directors, Foamex shall allow Executive to exercise his stock options in
Foamex, including but not limited to those stock options under the parties'
Nonqualified Stock Option Agreement, that are vested as of the date that this
Agreement is executed, at any time from the date of this Agreement through
ninety (90) days after the last payment is made to Employee pursuant to Section
1.1(c) of this Agreement, notwithstanding any terms to the contrary under the
Nonqualified Stock Option Agreement.

     5 Non-Competition. For a period of one year beginning on the Termination
Date, the Executive shall not for any reason, either directly or indirectly,
participate, engage, or have a financial interest in a "Competing Business" as
an owner, employee, agent, consultant, proprietor, shareholder, partner,
advisor, Board of Director, or otherwise; in the states (and/or commonwealth)
where Foamex operates or has an existing customer base. For purposes of this
Agreement, a Competing Business is defined as any individual, corporation,
partnership, entity, and/ or other form of business which manufactures, sells
and/ or otherwise distributes products identical or similar to those
manufactured, sold and/or otherwise distributed by Foamex during the Executive's
tenure with Foamex. Nothing in this paragraph shall preclude the Executive from
participating in the Carpet Cushion Council, providing services to businesses
commonly known as "Pro-Source" or "Coverall", provided the Executive's
involvement with these business entities shall have no material negative effect
on Foamex's operations. In addition, in order to compete in a competing
business, not otherwise referenced in this paragraph, the Executive may submit
to the Chief Executive Officer of Foamex reasonable requests to waive some or
all of the provisions of this section 5. Consent to such a request for waiver
will not be unreasonably withheld provided that the Executive's participation in
a Competing Business shall be deemed to have, and shall continue to have during
the executives involvement, no adverse effect on Foamex's business. In the event
that a waiver is granted, and Executive's involvement in a Competing Business,
is found to have an adverse effect on Foamex's business Foamex shall have the
right to withdraw such waiver and enforce the applicable terms and conditions of
this Section 5.

     6 No Solicitation. For a period of one year beginning on the Termination
Date, the Executive agrees that he will not directly or indirect solicit or
encourage Foamex employees to terminate their employment with Foamex, and/or to
become employed by or work with the Executive or any third party. During this
period the Executive also agrees that he will not interfere in any way with
Foamex's business relationships with its customers, suppliers, vendors,
representatives, agents and/or employees

     7 Acknowledgment of Non-Competition and No Solicitation Provisions. The
Executive expressly acknowledges and agrees that (a) he understands the scope
and meaning of the restrictions set forth in sections 5 and 6 of this Agreement,
(b) agrees that they are necessary and reasonable to protect Foamex's legitimate
interests, (c) agrees that he has been well compensated though this Agreement
for agreeing to these restrictions, (d) agrees that these restrictions will not
prevent him from engaging in gainful and meaningful employment during their one
year term.

     8 Confidential Corporate Information. The Executive will maintain the
confidentiality of Foamex's Confidential Corporate Information. "Confidential
Corporate Information" as used in this Agreement means: (i) confidential,
proprietary, commercially-sensitive, or otherwise secret information, knowledge,
data analyses, or reports concerning the Company's businesses, legal affairs,
products, services, methods, customers, customer-related information, budgets,

writing, or electronically. Confidential Corporate Information does not include
information that is, or becomes, available to the public generally.

          otherwise, arising out of his employment relationship with Foamex

          authorize, implement, or enforce the terms of this Agreement. It is
          understood and agreed by the Executive and Foamex, that those to whom

          of this Agreement confidential;

               e) that the Executive acknowledges that this Agreement is
          contractual and not a mere recital; and agrees that this Agreement
          shall be given full force and effect and that it shall be binding upon
          the Executive's heirs, executors, successors, administrators and

     13 Rights Transferable to Executive's Estate. If the Executive should die
during the term of this Agreement, the remaining unpaid portion of his severance
payment (if any) and his vested and unvested stock options will be transferred
and assignable to his estate, to the extent permissible by law and the terms of
the plan.

     14 Parties Covered by Agreement. The provisions of this Agreement shall
inure to the benefit of Foamex, its successors and assigns, and shall be binding
upon Foamex and the Executive, and his heirs, personal representatives, and
successors, including, without limitation, the Executive's estate and executors,
administrators, or trustees of such estate. In the event of the sale, merger, or
consolidation of Foamex with or into any other corporation or entity, or in the

obligations of Foamex hereunder and shall be substituted for Foamex in all

with and possible under applicable law. . 16 Application of Agreement. Except
for agreements between the Executive and Foamex concerning certain stock option
grants listed in Schedule "A" to this Agreement, upon execution of this

Agreement shall supersede any and all previously existing agreements and
understandings between the parties.

remain open for acceptance by the Executive at any time before and including
twenty-one (21) calendar days from the date this Agreement is received by the
