                            INVESTOR RIGHTS AGREEMENT

     THIS INVESTOR RIGHTS AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is made as of the 25th
day of October, 2001, by and between Polar Molecular Corporation, a Delaware
corporation ("PMC"), and Affiliated Investments, L.L.C., a Michigan limited
liability company (the "Investor").

                                    RECITALS

     WHEREAS, PMC and the Investor have entered into a Purchase Agreement (the
"Purchase Agreement") of even date herewith whereby the Investor will loan PMC
$600,000 in exchange for a Promissory Note (the "Note") in the principal amount
of $600,000 and 555,556 shares of unregistered common stock par value $0.0001 of
PMC (the "Common Stock"); and

     WHEREAS, the Company is a party to that certain Investor Rights Agreement
(the "Prior Rights Agreement") dated as of January 30, 2001 whereby the Company
granted registration rights to certain investors; and

     WHEREAS, the Prior Rights Agreement prohibits the Company from granting any
new registration rights that will (i) reduce the amount of securities that may
be registered under the Prior Rights Agreement or (ii) allow a demand for
registration of securities; and

     WHEREAS, as a condition to the Purchase Agreement PMC agreed to grant the
Investor certain registration rights for all of the shares of Common Stock owned
by the Investor or which the Investor is entitled to acquire as of the date
hereof and PMC and the Investor hereby agree that this Agreement shall govern
the rights of the Investor to cause PMC to register shares of Common Stock
issued.

                                    AGREEMENT

     NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing, PMC and the Investor
hereby agree as follows:

     1. Registration Rights. PMC covenants and agrees as follows:

     1.1 Definitions. For purposes of this Section 1:

          (a) The term "Act" means the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

          (b) The term "Form S-3" means such form under the Act as in effect on
     the date hereof or any registration form under the Act subsequently adopted
     by the SEC that permits inclusion or incorporation of substantial
     information by reference to other documents filed by PMC with the SEC.

                                       1

<PAGE>


          (c) The term "Holder" means any person, owning or having the right to
     acquire Registrable Securities or any assignee thereof in accordance with
     Section 1.09 hereof.

          (d) The term "Initial Offering" means PMC's next firm commitment
     underwritten public offering of its Common Stock under the Act.

          (e) The term "1934 Act" means the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
     amended.

          (f) The term "register," "registered," and "registration" refer to a
     registration effected by preparing and filing a registration statement or
     similar document in compliance with the Act, and the declaration or
     ordering of effectiveness of such registration statement or document.

          (g) The term "Registrable Securities" means (i) shares of the Common
     Stock issued pursuant to the Purchase Agreement; (ii) shares of Common
     Stock owned by the Investor or which the Investor is entitled to acquire as
     of the date hereof, other than pursuant to the Purchase Agreement; and
     (iii) any Common Stock of PMC issued as (or issuable upon the conversion or
     exercise of any warrant, right or other security that is issued as) a
     dividend or other distribution with respect to, or in exchange for, or in
     replacement of, the shares referenced in (i) or (ii) above, excluding in
     all cases, however, any Registrable Securities sold by a person in a
     transaction in which his rights under this Section 1 are not assigned.

          (h) The number of shares of "Registrable Securities" outstanding shall
     be determined by the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding that are,
     and the number of shares of Common Stock issuable pursuant to then
     exercisable or convertible securities that are, Registrable Securities.

          (i) The term "SEC" shall mean the Securities and Exchange Commission.

     1.2 Company Registration.

          (a) If (but without any obligation to do so) PMC proposes to register
     (including for this purpose a registration effected by PMC for stockholders
     other than the Holders) any of its stock or other securities under the Act
     in connection with the public offering of such securities (other than a
     registration relating solely to the sale of securities to participants in a
     Company stock plan, a registration relating to a corporate reorganization
     or other transaction under Rule 145 of the Act, a registration on any form
     that does not include substantially the same information as would be
     required to be included in a registration statement covering the sale of
     the Registrable Securities, or a registration in which the only Common
     Stock being registered is Common Stock issuable upon conversion of debt
     securities that are also being registered), PMC shall, at such time,
     promptly give each Holder written notice of such registration. Upon the
     written request of each Holder given within twenty (20) days after mailing
     of such notice by

                                       2

<PAGE>

     PMC in accordance with Section 2.5, PMC shall, subject to the provisions of
     Section 1.2(c), use all reasonable efforts to cause to be registered under
     the Act all of the Registrable Securities that each such Holder has
     requested to be registered; provided, however, that the Registrable
     Securities will be excluded from such registration to the extent that the
     inclusion of such Registrable Securities would otherwise reduce the amount
     of securities offered for sale pursuant to the Prior Rights Agreement.

          (b) Right to Terminate Registration. PMC shall have the right to
     terminate or withdraw any registration initiated by it under this Section
     1.2 prior to the effectiveness of such registration whether or not any
     Holder has elected to include securities in such registration. The expenses
     of such withdrawn registration shall be borne by PMC in accordance with
     Section 1.5 hereof.

          (c) Underwriting Requirements. In connection with any offering
     involving an underwriting of shares of PMC's capital stock, PMC shall not
     be required under this Section 1.2 to include any of the Holders'
     securities in such underwriting unless they accept the terms of the
     underwriting as agreed upon between PMC and the underwriters selected by it
     (unless the terms of such underwriting purport to alter the priority status
     of the registration rights of the Holders of Registrable Securities) and
     enter into an underwriting agreement in customary form with an underwriter
     or underwriters selected by PMC, and then only in such quantity as the
     underwriters determine in their sole discretion will not jeopardize the
     success of the offering by PMC. If the total amount of securities,
     including securities offered pursuant to the Prior Rights Agreement (the
     "Prior Securities") and Registrable Securities, requested by stockholders
     to be included in such offering exceeds the amount of securities sold other
     than by PMC that the underwriters determine in their sole discretion is
     compatible with the success of the offering, then PMC shall be required to
     (i) exclude all shares of capital stock other than the Prior Securities,
     Registrable Securities and shares to be sold by PMC for its own account,
     and (ii) include in the offering only that number of Prior Securities and
     Registrable Securities that the underwriters determine in their sole
     discretion will not jeopardize the success of the offering (the securities
     so included to be apportioned first to all Prior Securities offered for
     sale under the Prior Rights Agreement and then pro rata among the selling
     Holders according to the total amount of securities entitled to be included
     therein owned by each selling Holder or in such other proportions as shall
     mutually be agreed to by such selling Holders). For purposes of the
     preceding parenthetical concerning apportionment, for any selling
     stockholder that is a Holder of Registrable Securities and that is a
     partnership or corporation, the partners, retired partners and stockholders
     of such Holder, or the estates and family members of any such partners and
     retired partners and any trusts for the benefit of any of the foregoing
     persons shall be deemed to be a single "selling Holder," and any pro rata
     reduction with respect to such "selling Holder" shall be based upon the
     aggregate amount of Registrable Securities owned by all such related
     entities and individuals. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will
     any Registrable Securities be excluded from an offering unless all other
     shares of capital stock of any kind (other than the Prior Securities and
     those to be sold by PMC for its own account) are first excluded; it being
     understood and agreed that the registration rights granted to the

                                       3

<PAGE>

     Holders of Registrable Securities pursuant to this Agreement will not in
     any event reduce the amount of Prior Securities offered for sale pursuant
     to the Prior Rights Agreement.

     1.3 Obligations of PMC. Whenever required under this Section 1 to effect
the registration of any Registrable Securities, PMC shall, as expeditiously as
reasonably possible:

          (a) prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement with
     respect to such Registrable Securities and use best efforts to cause such
     registration statement to become effective, and, upon the request of the
     Holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities registered thereunder,
     keep such registration statement effective for a period of up to one
     hundred eighty (180) days or, if earlier, until the distribution
     contemplated in the Registration Statement has been completed;

          (b) prepare and file with the SEC such amendments and supplements to
     such registration statement and the prospectus used in connection with such
     registration statement as may be necessary to comply with the provisions of
     the Act with respect to the disposition of all securities covered by such
     registration statement;

          (c) furnish to the Holders such numbers of copies of a prospectus,
     including a preliminary prospectus, in conformity with the requirements of
     the Act, and such other documents as they may reasonably request in order
     to facilitate the disposition of Registrable Securities owned by them;

          (d) use best efforts to register and qualify the securities covered by
     such registration statement under such other securities or Blue Sky laws of
     such jurisdictions as shall be reasonably requested by the Holders,
     provided that PMC shall not be required in connection therewith or as a
     condition thereto to qualify to do business or to file a general consent to
     service of process in any such states or jurisdictions;

          (e) in the event of any underwritten public offering, enter into and
     perform its obligations under an underwriting agreement, in usual and
     customary form, with the managing underwriter of such offering;

          (f) notify each Holder of Registrable Securities covered by such
     registration statement at any time when a prospectus relating thereto is
     required to be delivered under the Act or the happening of any event as a
     result of which the prospectus included in such registration statement, as
     then in effect, includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to
     state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
     the statements therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances
     then existing;

          (g) cause all such Registrable Securities registered pursuant
     hereunder to be listed on each securities exchange on which similar
     securities issued by PMC are then listed; and

                                       4

<PAGE>

          (h) provide a transfer agent and registrar for all Registrable
     Securities registered pursuant hereunder and a CUSIP number for all such
     Registrable Securities, in each case not later than the effective date of
     such registration.

     1.4 Information from Holder. It shall be a condition precedent to the
obligations of PMC to take any action pursuant to this Section 1 with respect to
the Registrable Securities of any selling Holder that such Holder shall furnish
to PMC such information regarding itself, the Registrable Securities held by it,
and the intended method of disposition of such securities as shall be required
to effect the registration of such Holder's Registrable Securities.

     1.5 Expenses of Registration. All expenses other than underwriting
discounts and commissions incurred in connection with registrations, filings or
qualifications pursuant to Sections 1.2, including (without limitation) all
registration, filing and qualification fees, printers' and accounting fees, fees
and disbursements of counsel for PMC and the reasonable fees and disbursements
of one counsel for the selling Holders shall be borne by PMC.

     1.6 Delay of Registration. No Holder shall have any right to obtain or seek
an injunction restraining or otherwise delaying any such registration as the
result of any controversy that might arise with respect to the interpretation or
implementation of this Section 1.

     1.7 Indemnification. In the event any Registrable Securities are included
in a registration statement under this Section 1:

          (a) To the extent permitted by law, PMC will indemnify and hold
     harmless each Holder, the partners or officers, directors and stockholders
     of each Holder, legal counsel and accountants for each Holder, any
     underwriter (as defined in the Act) for such Holder and each person, if
     any, who controls such Holder or underwriter within the meaning of the Act
     or the 1934 Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (joint
     or several) to which they may become subject under the Act, the 1934 Act or
     any state securities laws, insofar as such losses, claims, damages, or
     liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon
     any of the following statements, omissions or violations (collectively a
     "Violation"): (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a
     material fact contained in such registration statement, including any
     preliminary prospectus or final prospectus contained therein or any
     amendments or supplements thereto, (ii) the omission or alleged omission to
     state therein a material fact required to be stated therein, or necessary
     to make the statements therein not misleading, or (iii) any violation or
     alleged violation by PMC of the Act, the 1934 Act, any state securities
     laws or any rule or regulation promulgated under the Act, the 1934 Act or
     any state securities laws; and PMC will reimburse each such Holder,
     underwriter or controlling person for any legal or other expenses
     reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending
     any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; provided, however, that
     the indemnity agreement contained in this subsection 1.7(a) shall not apply
     to amounts paid in settlement of any such loss, claim, damage, liability or
     action if such settlement is effected without the consent of PMC (which
     consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), nor shall PMC be liable in any
     such case for any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action to the
     extent that it arises out of

                                       5

<PAGE>

     or is based upon a Violation that occurs in reliance upon and in conformity
     with written information furnished expressly for use in connection with
     such registration by any such Holder, underwriter or controlling person;
     provided further, however, that the foregoing indemnity agreement with
     respect to any preliminary prospectus shall not inure to the benefit of any
     Holder or underwriter, or any person controlling such Holder or
     underwriter, from whom the person asserting any such losses, claims,
     damages or liabilities purchased shares in the offering, if a copy of the
     prospectus (as then amended or supplemented if PMC shall have furnished any
     amendments or supplements thereto) was not sent or given by or on behalf of
     such Holder or underwriter to such person, if required by law so to have
     been delivered, at or prior to the written confirmation of the sale of the
     shares to such person, and if the prospectus (as so amended or
     supplemented) would have cured the defect giving rise to such loss, claim,
     damage or liability.

          (b) To the extent permitted by law, each selling Holder will indemnify
     and hold harmless PMC, each of its directors, each of its officers who has
     signed the registration statement, each person, if any, who controls PMC
     within the meaning of the Act, legal counsel and accountants for PMC, any
     underwriter, any other Holder selling securities in such registration
     statement and any controlling person of any such underwriter or other
     Holder, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (joint or
     several) to which any of the foregoing persons may become subject, under
     the Act, the 1934 Act or any state securities laws, insofar as such losses,
     claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereto) arise out of
     or are based upon any Violation, in each case to the extent (and only to
     the extent) that such Violation occurs in reliance upon and in conformity
     with written information furnished by such Holder expressly for use in
     connection with such registration; and each such Holder will reimburse any
     person intended to be indemnified pursuant to this subsection 1.7(b), for
     any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such person in
     connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage,
     liability or action; provided, however, that the indemnity agreement
     contained in this subsection 1.7(b) shall not apply to amounts paid in
     settlement of any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action if such
     settlement is effected without the consent of the Holder (which consent
     shall not be unreasonably withheld), provided that in no event shall any
     indemnity under this subsection 1.7(b) exceed the gross proceeds from the
     offering received by such Holder.

          (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section
     1.7 of notice of the commencement of any action (including any governmental
     action), such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to
     be made against any indemnifying party under this Section 1.7, deliver to
     the indemnifying party a written notice of the commencement thereof and the
     indemnifying party shall have the right to participate in, and, to the
     extent the indemnifying party so desires, jointly with any other
     indemnifying party similarly noticed, to assume the defense thereof with
     counsel mutually satisfactory to the parties; provided, however, that an
     indemnified party (together with all other indemnified parties that may be
     represented without conflict by one counsel) shall have the right to retain
     one separate counsel, with the fees and expenses to be paid by the
     indemnifying party, if representation of such indemnified party by the
     counsel retained by the indemnifying party would be inappropriate due to

                                       6

<PAGE>

     actual or potential differing interests between such indemnified party and
     any other party represented by such counsel in such proceeding. The failure
     to deliver written notice to the indemnifying party within a reasonable
     time of the commencement of any such action, if prejudicial to its ability
     to defend such action, shall relieve such indemnifying party of any
     liability to the indemnified party under this Section 1.7, but the omission
     so to deliver written notice to the indemnifying party will not relieve it
     of any liability that it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than
     under this Section 1.7.

          (d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 1.7 is held by
     a court of competent jurisdiction to be unavailable to an indemnified party
     with respect to any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense referred to
     herein, then the indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such
     indemnified party hereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable
     by such indemnified party as a result of such loss, liability, claim,
     damage or expense in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the
     relative fault of the indemnifying party on the one hand and of the
     indemnified party on the other in connection with the statements or
     omissions that resulted in such loss, liability, claim, damage or expense,
     as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault
     of the indemnifying party and of the indemnified party shall be determined
     by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue
     statement of a material fact or the omission to state a material fact
     relates to information supplied by the indemnifying party or by the
     indemnified party and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to
     information, and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or
     omission.

          (e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that the provisions
     on indemnification and contribution contained in the underwriting agreement
     entered into in connection with the underwritten public offering are in
     conflict with the foregoing provisions, the provisions in the underwriting
     agreement shall control.

          (f) The obligations of PMC and Holders under this Section 1.7 shall
     survive the completion of any offering of Registrable Securities in a
     registration statement under this Section 1, and otherwise.

     1.8 Reports Under Securities Exchange Act of 1934. With a view to making
available to the Holders the benefits of Rule 144 promulgated under the Act and
any other rule or regulation of the SEC that may at any time permit a Holder to
sell securities of PMC to the public without registration or pursuant to a
registration on Form S-3, PMC agrees to:

          (a) make and keep public information available, as those terms are
     understood and defined in SEC Rule 144, at all times after the effective
     date of the Initial Offering;

          (b) file with the SEC in a timely manner all reports and other
     documents required of PMC under the Act and the 1934 Act; and

          (c) furnish to any Holder, so long as the Holder owns any Registrable
     Securities, forthwith upon request (i) a written statement by PMC that it
     has complied

                                       7

<PAGE>

     with the reporting requirements of SEC Rule 144 (at any time after ninety
     (90) days after the effective date of the first registration statement
     filed by PMC), the Act and the 1934 Act (at any time after it has become
     subject to such reporting requirements), or that it qualifies as a
     registrant whose securities may be resold pursuant to Form S-3 (at any time
     after it so qualifies), (ii) a copy of the most recent annual or quarterly
     report of PMC and such other reports and documents so filed by PMC, and
     (iii) such other information as may be reasonably requested in availing any
     Holder of any rule or regulation of the SEC that permits the selling of any
     such securities without registration or pursuant to such form.

     1.9 Assignment of Registration Rights. The rights to cause PMC to register
Registrable Securities pursuant to this Section 1 may be assigned (but only with
all related obligations) by a Holder to a transferee or assignee of such
securities that (i) is a subsidiary, parent, partner, limited partner, retired
partner or stockholder of a Holder, (ii) is a Holder's family member or trust
for the benefit of an individual Holder, or (iii) after such assignment or
transfer, holds at least 25,000 shares of Registrable Securities (subject to
appropriate adjustment for stock splits, stock dividends, combinations and other
recapitalizations), provided: (a) PMC is, within a reasonable time after such
transfer, furnished with written notice of the name and address of such
transferee or assignee and the securities with respect to which such
registration rights are being assigned; (b) such transferee or assignee agrees
in writing to be bound by and subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, including without limitation the provisions of Section 1.10 below;
and (c) such assignment shall be effective only if immediately following such
transfer the further disposition of such securities by the transferee or
assignee is restricted under the Act.

     1.10 Limitations on Subsequent Registration Rights. From and after the date
of this Agreement, PMC shall not, without the prior written consent of the
Holders of two-thirds of the Registrable Securities, enter into any agreement
with any holder or prospective holder of any securities of PMC that would allow
such holder or prospective holder (a) to include such securities in any
registration filed under Section 1.2 hereof, unless under the terms of such
agreement, such holder or prospective holder may include such securities in any
such registration only to the extent that the inclusion of such securities will
not reduce the amount of the Registrable Securities of the Holders that are
included or (b) to demand registration of their securities.

     1.11 "Market Stand-Off' Agreement. Each Holder hereby agrees that it will
not, without the prior written consent of the managing underwriter, during the
period commencing on the date of the final prospectus relating to PMC's initial
public offering and ending on the date specified by PMC and the managing
underwriter (such period not to exceed one hundred eighty (180) days) (i) lend,
offer, pledge, sell, contract to sell, sell any option or contract to purchase,
purchase any option or contract to sell, grant any option, right or warrant to
purchase, or otherwise transfer or dispose of, directly or indirectly, any
shares of Common Stock or any securities convertible into or exercisable or
exchangeable for Common Stock (whether such shares or any such securities are
then owned by the Holder or are thereafter acquired), or (ii) enter into any
swap or other arrangement that transfers to another, in whole or in part, any of
the economic consequences of ownership of the Common Stock, whether any such
transaction

                                       8

<PAGE>

described in clause (i) or (ii) above is to be settled by delivery of Common
Stock or such other securities, in cash or otherwise. The foregoing provisions
of this Section 1.11 shall apply only to PMC's initial public offering of equity
securities, shall not apply to the sale of any shares to an underwriter pursuant
to an underwriting agreement, and shall only be applicable to the Holders if all
officers and directors and greater than five percent (5%) stockholders of PMC
enter into similar agreements. The underwriters in connection with PMC's initial
public offering are intended third party beneficiaries of this Section 1.11 and
shall have the right, power and authority to enforce the provisions hereof as
though they were a party hereto.

     In order to enforce the foregoing covenant, PMC may impose stop-transfer
instructions with respect to the Registrable Securities of each Holder (and the
shares or securities of every other person subject to the foregoing restriction)
until the end of such period.

     1.12 Termination of Registration Rights. No Holder shall be entitled to
exercise any right provided for in this Section 1 after five (5) years following
the consummation of the Initial Offering or, as to any Holder, such earlier time
at which all Registrable Securities held by such Holder (and any affiliate of
the Holder with whom such Holder must aggregate its sales under Rule 144) can be
sold in any three (3)-month period without registration in compliance with Rule
144 of the Act.

     2. Miscellaneous.

     2.1 Successors and Assigns. Except as otherwise provided herein, the terms
and conditions of this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding
upon the respective successors and assigns of the parties (including transferees
of any shares of Registrable Securities). Nothing in this Agreement, express or
implied, is intended to confer upon any party other than the parties hereto or
their respective successors and assigns any rights, remedies, obligations, or
liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement, except as expressly provided
in this Agreement.
