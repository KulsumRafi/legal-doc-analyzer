                               elapsed. If any amount owing under the Term Loan
                               Facility is not paid when due, such amount will
                               bear interest at a rate per annum equal to 14.0%

                               otherwise be entitled to receive. Neither a
                               merger or consolidation of the Company with or

                               portion of the outstanding shares of Series C
                               Preferred at a cash redemption price equal to
                               $100,000 per share; provided, however, that no
                               such redemption shall be permitted at such time
                               as the terms and provisions of any financing or
                               working capital agreement of the Company or by
                               which the Company is bound specifically prohibit
                               such redemption, or if such redemption would
                               constitute a breach thereof or a default
                               thereunder or if such redemption would, upon the
                               giving of notice or passage of time or both,
                               constitute such breach or default.

                               (4) Voting Rights: Except as otherwise provided
                               by law, the holders of Series C Preferred shall
                               not be entitled to vote on any matters submitted
                               for a vote of the holders of the Common Stock or
                               of any other class of capital stock.

Mandatory Redemption:          Each issued and outstanding share of Series C
                               Preferred shall be mandatorily redeemed by the
                               Company upon consummation of the Rights Offering
                               at a cash redemption price (the "Redemption
                               Price") equal to $100,000 per share.

                               to exercise its basic subscription privilege (the
                               "Basic Subscription Privilege") in the Rights
                               Offering and to back-stop the Rights Offering
                               (the "Back-stop"; such obligations together, the
                               "Investor Obligations"), at the consummation of
                               the Rights Offering, the Investor may elect, by
                               written notice delivered to the Company, to
                               satisfy all or part of the Investor Obligations
                               by

                               Redemption Price of the Series C Preferred the
                               Investor then holds, if any, and if such notice
                               is given, (i) the Company shall credit an amount
                               equal to the aggregate Redemption Price specified
                               in the notice for all shares of Series C
                               Preferred held by the Investor, if any, against,
                               and reduce accordingly, the Investor Obligations
                               to the extent specified in such notice and (ii)
                               to the extent the aggregate Redemption Price
                               payable to the Investor exceeds the amount of
                               Investor Obligations offset as specified in such
                               notice, the Company shall pay cash in the amount
                               of such excess to the Investor upon the
                               consummation of the Rights Offering.

Use of Proceeds:               The net proceeds shall be contributed to RCPC in
                               the form of a capital contribution or in such
                               other form as the Company and RCPC may agree and
                               as may be permitted by the Bank Credit Agreement.

Governing Law:                 State of New York
