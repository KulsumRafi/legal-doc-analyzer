Benefit payments have commenced under this Agreement but before receiving all
such payments, the Bank shall pay the remaining benefits to the Executive's
beneficiary at the same time and in the same amounts they would have been paid
to the Executive had the Executive survived.

         3.3      Death After Termination of Employment But Before Payment

entitled to prior to death except that the benefit payments shall commence on
the first day of the month following the date of the Executive's death.

SECTION 4 - Beneficiaries

         4.1      Beneficiary Designations. The Executive shall designate a

received by the Bank during the Executive's lifetime. The Executive's
beneficiary designation shall be deemed automatically revoked if the beneficiary
predeceases the Executive, or if the Executive names a spouse as beneficiary and
the marriage is subsequently dissolved. If the Executive dies without a valid
beneficiary designation, all payments shall be made to the Executive's estate.

         4.2      Facility of Payment. If a benefit is payable to a minor, to a
person declared incompetent, or to a person incapable of handling the
disposition of his or her property, the Bank may pay such benefit to the
guardian, legal representative or person having the care or custody of such
minor, incompetent person or incapable person. The Bank may require proof of
incompetence, minority or guardianship as it may deem appropriate prior to
distribution of the benefit. Such distribution shall completely discharge the
Bank from all liability with respect to such benefit.

under this Agreement if the Executive commits suicide within three years after
the date of this Agreement. In addition, the Bank shall not pay any benefit

         (3)      Considerations on Review. In considering the review, the Bank

agreement signed by the Bank and the Executive.

         7.2      Notwithstanding Section 7.1, the Bank may amend or terminate

SECTION 8 - Status as an Unsecured General Creditor.

         8.1      Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary: (i)
the Executive shall have no legal or equitable rights, interests or claims in or
to any specific property or assets of the Bank as a result of this Agreement;
(ii) none of the Bank's assets shall be held in or under any trust for the
benefit of the Executive or held in any way as security for the fulfillment of
the obligations of the Bank under this Agreement; (iii) all of the Bank's assets
shall be and remain the general unpledged and unrestricted assets of the Bank;
(iv) the Bank's obligation under this Agreement shall be that of an unfunded and
unsecured promise by the Bank to pay money in the future; and (v) the Executive
shall be an unsecured general creditor with respect to any benefits which may be
payable under the terms of this Agreement. Notwithstanding subparagraphs (i)
through (v) above, the Bank and the Executive acknowledge and agree that, in the
event of a Change in Control, upon request of the Executive, or in the Bank's
discretion if the Executive does not so request and the Bank nonetheless deems
it appropriate, the Bank shall establish, concurrent with this agreement, a
Rabbi Trust or multiple Rabbi Trusts (the "Trust" or "Trusts") upon such terms
and conditions as the Bank, in its sole discretion, deems appropriate and in
compliance with applicable provisions of the Code, in order to permit the Bank
to make contributions and/or transfer assets to the Trust or Trusts to discharge
its obligations pursuant to this Agreement. The principal of the Trust or Trusts
and any earnings thereon shall be held separate and apart from other funds of
the Bank to be used exclusively for discharge of the Bank's obligations pursuant
to this Agreement and shall continue to be subject to the claims of the Bank's
general creditors until paid to the Executive in such manner and at such times
as specified in this Agreement.

         8.2      Bank reserves the right to determine, in its sole and absolute
discretion, whether, to what extent and by what method, if any, to provide for
the payment of the amounts which may be payable to the Executive, under the
terms of this Agreement. In the event that the Bank elects to fund this
Agreement, in whole or in part, through the use of life insurance or annuities,
or both, the Bank shall determine the ownership and beneficial interests of any
such policy of life insurance or annuity. The Bank further reserves the right,
in its sole and absolute discretion, to terminate any such policy, and any other
devise used to fund its obligations under this Agreement, at any time, in whole
or in part. Consistent with Section 8.1 above, the Executive shall have no
right, title or interest in or to any funding source or amount utilized by the
Bank pursuant to this Agreement, and any such funding source or amount shall not
constitute security for the performance of the Bank's obligations pursuant to
this Agreement. In connection with the foregoing, the Executive agrees to
execute such documents and undergo such medical examinations or tests which the
Bank may request and which may be reasonably necessary to facilitate any funding
for this Agreement including, without limitation, the Bank's acquisition of any
policy of insurance or annuity.

         8.3      Notwithstanding any other provision of the Agreement, the
Board of Directors of the Bank or the Holding Company may, its sole and absolute
discretion: (i)

Page 8

<PAGE>

accelerate the payment of the amounts due under the terms of this Agreement,
provided that the Executive consents to the revised payout terms determined
appropriate by the Board of Directors; (ii) modify other terms or conditions of
the Agreement, as the Board of Directors deems necessary or appropriate, in
response to changes in legislation, to rules, regulations or rulings issued
under the Internal Revenue Code, or to other similar events having a substantial
impact on the costs and benefits to the Bank of its obligations under the
Agreement, provided that the Executive shall receive a substantially equivalent
benefit in the event that a benefit existing under the Agreement is canceled as
a result of such modification.

SECTION 9 - Miscellaneous

         9.1      Binding Effect. This Agreement shall bind the Executive and
the Bank, and their beneficiaries, survivors, executors, successors,
administrators and transferees.

         9.2      No Guarantee of Employment. This Agreement is not an
employment policy or contract. It does not give the Executive the right to
remain an employee of the Bank, nor does it interfere with the Bank's right to
discharge the Executive. It also does not require the Executive to remain an
employee nor interfere with the Executive's right to terminate employment at any
time.

         9.3      Non-Transferability. Benefits under this Agreement cannot be
sold, transferred, assigned, pledged, attached or encumbered in any manner. In
particular, the Executive shall have no power or right to transfer, assign,
anticipate, hypothecate, modify or otherwise encumber any part or all of the
amounts payable hereunder, nor, prior to payment in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement, shall any portion of such amounts be: (i) subject to seizure by
any creditor of the Executive, by a proceeding at law or in equity, for the
payment of any debts, judgments, alimony or separate maintenance obligations
which may be owed by the Executive; or (ii) transferable by operation of law in
the event of bankruptcy, insolvency or otherwise. Any such attempted assignment
or transfer shall be void.

         9.4      Reorganization. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
to the benefit of the Executive and the Bank. Accordingly, the Bank shall not
merge or consolidate into or with another corporation, or reorganize or sell
substantially all of its assets to another corporation, firm or person, unless
and until such succeeding or continuing corporation, firm or person agrees to
assume and discharge the obligations of the Bank under this Agreement. In the
alternative, the Holding Company may agree to assume and discharge the
obligation of the Bank under this Agreement. Upon the occurrence of such event,
the term "Bank" as used in this Agreement shall be deemed to refer to such
surviving or successor firm, person, entity or corporation, or the Holding
Company, as the case may be.

         9.5      Tax Withholding. The Bank shall withhold any taxes that are

agency or governmental authority having jurisdiction over the Bank or the

effect of this Agreement.

         9.7      Unfunded Arrangement. The Executive and beneficiary are
general unsecured creditors of the Bank for the payment of benefits under this
Agreement. The benefits represent the mere promise by the Bank to pay such
benefits. The rights to benefits are not subject in any manner to anticipation,
alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance, attachment, or
garnishment by creditors. Any insurance on the Executive's life is a general
asset of the Bank to which the Executive and beneficiary have no preferred or
secured claim.

agreements, either oral or in writing, between the parties with respect to the
subject matter of this Agreement and contains all of the covenants and
agreements between the parties with respect thereto. Each party to this
Agreement acknowledges that no other representations, inducements, promises, or
agreements, oral or otherwise, have been made by any party, or anyone acting on
behalf of any party, which are not set forth herein, and that no other
agreement, statement, or promise not contained in this Agreement shall be valid
or binding on either party. No rights are granted to the Executive by virtue of

         9.13     Opportunity To Consult With Independent Advisors. The
Executive acknowledges that he or she has been afforded the opportunity to
consult with independent advisors of his choosing including, without limitation,
accountants or tax advisors and counsel regarding both the benefits granted to
him under the terms of this Agreement and the (i) terms and conditions which may
affect the Executive's right to these benefits and (ii) personal tax effects of
such benefits including, without limitation, the effects of any federal or state
taxes, Section 280G of the Code, and any other taxes, costs, expenses or
liabilities whatsoever related to such benefits, which in any of the foregoing
instances the Executive acknowledges and agrees shall be the sole responsibility
of the Executive notwithstanding any other term or provision of this Agreement.
The Executive further acknowledges and agrees that the Bank shall have no
liability whatsoever related to any such personal tax effects or other personal
costs, expenses, or liabilities applicable to the Executive and further
specifically waives any right for himself or herself, and his or her heirs,
beneficiaries, legal representatives, agents, successor and assign to claim or
assert liability on the part of the Bank related to the matters described above

read, understands and consents to all of the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, and that he or she enters into this Agreement with a full
understanding of its terms and conditions.

         9.14     Arbitration of Disputes. All claims, disputes and other
matters in question arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the breach
or interpretation thereof, other than those matters which are to be determined
by the Bank in its sole and absolute discretion, shall be resolved by binding
arbitration before a representative member, selected by the mutual agreement of
the parties, of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. ("JAMS"),
located in Portland, Oregon. In the event JAMS is unable or unwilling to conduct
the arbitration provided for under the terms of this Paragraph, or has
discontinued its business, the parties agree that a representative member,
selected by the mutual agreement of the parties of the American Arbitration
Association ("AAA") located in Portland, Oregon, shall conduct the binding
arbitration referred to in this Paragraph. Notice of the demand for arbitration
shall be filed in writing with the other party to this Agreement and with JAMS
(or AAA, if necessary). In no event shall the demand for arbitration be made
after the date when institution of legal or equitable proceedings based on such
claim, dispute or other matter in question would be barred by the applicable
statute of limitations. The arbitration shall be subject to such rules of
procedure used or established by JAMS, or if there are none, the rules of
procedure used or established by AAA. Any award rendered by JAMS or AAA shall be
final and binding upon the parties, and as applicable, their respective heirs,
beneficiaries, legal representatives, agents, successors and assigns, and may be
entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Any arbitration hereunder
shall be conducted in The Dalles, Oregon, unless otherwise agreed to by the
parties.

         9.15     Attorneys' Fees. In the event of any arbitration or litigation
concerning any controversy, claim or dispute between the parties hereto, arising

hereof, the prevailing party shall

be entitled to recover from the losing party reasonable expenses, attorneys'
fees and costs incurred in connection therewith or in the enforcement or
collection of any judgment or award rendered therein. The "prevailing party"
means the party determined by the arbitrator(s) or court, as the case may be, to
have most nearly prevailed, even if such party did not prevail in all matters,
not necessarily the one in whose favor a judgment is rendered.

         9.16     Notice. Any notice required or permitted of either the
Executive or the Bank under this Agreement shall be deemed to have been duly
given, if by personal delivery, upon the date received by the party or its
authorized representative; if by facsimile, upon transmission to a telephone
number previously provided by the party to whom the facsimile is transmitted as
reflected in the records of the party transmitting the facsimile and upon
reasonable confirmation of such transmission; and if by mail, on the third day
after mailing via U.S. first class mail, registered or certified, postage
prepaid and return receipt requested, and addressed to the party at the address
given below for the receipt of notices, or such changed address as may be
requested in writing by a party.

                  If to the Bank:              Columbia River Bank
                                               420 East Third Street

         9.17.    Nonwaiver. The failure of either party to enforce at any time
or for any period of time any one or more of the terms or conditions of this
Agreement shall not be a waiver of such term(s) or condition(s) or of that
party's right thereafter to enforce each and every term and condition of this
Agreement.

         9.18     Partial Invalidity. If any terms, provision, covenant, or
condition of this Agreement is determined by an arbitrator or a court, as the
case may be, to be invalid, void, or unenforceable, such determination shall not
render any other term, provision, covenant or condition invalid, void or
unenforceable, and the Agreement shall remain in full force and effect
notwithstanding such partial invalidity.

         9.19     Modifications. Any modification of this Agreement shall be
effective only if it is in writing and signed by each party or such party's
authorized representative.

         IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Executive and the Bank have signed this
Agreement.
