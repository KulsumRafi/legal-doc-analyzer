Agreement, dated as of September 13, 2000 (the "Second Stock Option Agreement"),
between Holdings and you; Warrant, dated May 1, 2000 to Purchase Shares of Class

Employment Agreement, dated as of April 9, 2000 (the "Employment Agreement"),

Dear Steve:

With reference to the above agreements, this letter agreement sets forth certain
understandings reached between Holdings, IWO and you.

1. Attached hereto as Exhibit A is a true and correct copy of the First Stock
Option Agreement. The First Stock Option Agreement shall be amended as follows:

(a) Section 1 shall be amended by deleting the definitions of "Approved Sale,"
"Daily Vesting" and "Initial Public Offering" and replacing such definitions
with the following definitions:

"Approved Sale" means a transaction or a series of related transactions other
than a Designated Merger: (i) including, but not limited to, by way of merger or
consolidation, which results in any "person" or "group" (as such terms are used
in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act or any successor provisions to
either of the foregoing), other than (A) any one or more of the Initial
Stockholders or Affiliates thereof or (B) a non-U.S. entity with respect to
which an Initial Stockholder or Affiliate thereof has an administrative
relationship, becoming the "beneficial owner" (as defined in Rule 13d- 3 under
the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of a majority of the total voting
power of the capital stock of Holdings or otherwise able to elect a majority of
the board of directors of Holdings (for purposes of this definition, such person
or group shall be deemed to beneficially own capital stock of Holdings that is
held by any other corporation so long as such person or group beneficially owns,
directly or indirectly, in the aggregate a majority of the total capital stock
of such other corporation); or (ii) which results in the sale, transfer,
assignment, lease, conveyance or other disposition, directly or

<PAGE>

indirectly, of all or substantially all the assets of Holdings and its
subsidiaries, considered as a whole (other than to an Affiliate thereof).

"Daily Vesting" means vesting of the applicable portion of the Option
proportionately for each of the days during the applicable period that the
Optionee is employed by Holdings such that if Optionee remains employed for all
of the days during such applicable period such applicable portion of the Option
shall be vested in full.

"Initial Public Offering" means the sale of any of the common stock of Holdings
or the issuance of common stock of any Person in exchange for 100% of the
capital stock of Holdings pursuant to a registration statement that has been
declared effective under the Act, if following such sale or exchange (i) the
issuer is a reporting company under Section 12(b) or 12(g) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and (ii) such stock is traded on the New York
Stock Exchange or the American Stock Exchange, or is quoted on the Nasdaq
National Market System or is traded or quoted on any other national stock
exchange or national securities system.

(b) Section 1 shall be amended further by adding the following definition:

"Designated Merger" means a transaction that results in the merger,
consolidation or amalgamation of Holdings with or into any Person that results
in the conversion of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Holdings into
shares of capital stock of such Person (or its Affiliate) and such Person (or
its Affiliate) has an affiliation with Sprint Spectrum L.P. (or its Affiliates)
similar to the affiliation between IWO and Sprint Spectrum L.P. and its
Affiliates (other than with respect to the territory covered).

(c) Section 3 shall be amended to add the following new clauses (c) and (d):

"(c) Upon the occurrence of an Initial Public Offering, the portion of the
Performance Vesting Option that is not yet exercisable shall cease to vest on
the basis of performance and, instead, shall vest on the basis of Daily Vesting
over a period from January 1 of the year in which the closing of the Initial
Public Offering occurs through December 31, 2002.

(d) Notwithstanding Section 3(a) and Section 3(b), upon the occurrence of a
Designated Merger:

(i) the schedule set forth in Section 3(a) shall not apply with respect to 20%
of the Performance Vesting Options and Time Vesting Options that are not yet
exercisable (and shall continue to apply to the

                                        2

<PAGE>

remaining 80% of such options) and the Optionee shall have the right to exercise
such 20% of all unexercisable Performance Vesting Options and Time Vesting
Options; and

(ii) if Optionee's employment is terminated by Holdings without Cause within 12
months following the closing of such Designated Merger, then the schedule set
forth in Section 3(a) shall not apply with respect to the Performance Vesting
Options and Time Vesting Options that are not yet exercisable and the Optionee
shall have the right to exercise 100% of all unexercisable Performance Vesting
Options and Time Vesting Options."

(d) Section 4(b) shall be amended by deleting such section in its entirety and
replacing such section with the following:

"(b) The unexercisable portion of the Time Vesting Option and the Performance
Vesting Option shall expire on the earlier to occur of (i) the Termination Date
(giving effect to the vesting of such unexercisable portion in accordance with
Section 3(d)(ii), if applicable), provided that, if prior to an Initial Public
Offering, a pro rata portion of the portion of the Performance Vesting Option
scheduled to become exercisable in the year including the Termination Date shall
become exercisable as if the Optionee's employment had not been terminated if
performance targets for the Fiscal Year during which the Termination Date have
been met or exceeded, or (ii) except to the extent provided in Section 3(b),
Section 3(d) and Section 6(a), an Approved Sale or a Designated Merger. The
proration provided for in clause (b)(i) above will be determined by the number
of days elapsed in the year in which the termination occurred before the
Termination Date. The Performance Vesting Options that become exercisable
pursuant to clause (b)(i) above shall expire one year following the date on
which the Optionee received notice that the performance targets were met."

(e) Section 6(a) shall be amended by deleting such section in its entirety and
replacing such section with the following:

"(a) In the event of an Approved Sale or a Designated Merger, the unexercised
portion of the Option shall terminate upon such Approved Sale or Designated
Merger unless (i) provision is made in writing in connection with such Approved
Sale or Designated Merger for the assumption of such Options, or for the
substitutions of such Options of new awards covering the securities of a
successor entity or an Affiliate thereof, with appropriate adjustments as to the
number and kind of securities and exercise prices, in which event such
outstanding Options shall continue or be replaced, as the case may be, in the
manner and under the terms so provided; or (ii) the Board of Directors otherwise
shall provide in writing for such adjustments as it deems appropriate in the

                                        3

<PAGE>

terms and conditions of the then-outstanding Options, including without
limitation (A) accelerating the vesting of outstanding Options and/or (B)
providing for the cancellation of Options and their automatic conversion into
the right to receive the securities, cash or other consideration that a holder
of the shares underlying such Options would have been entitled to receive upon
consummation of such Approved Sale or Designated Merger had such shares been
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the closing date of the Approved
Sale or Designated Merger (net of the appropriate option exercise prices). If
pursuant to this Section 6(a) the Options are to terminate upon an Approved Sale
or Designated Merger without provision for any of the actions described in
clause (i) or (ii) above, then the Optionee shall be given at least ten (10)
days' prior notice of the proposed Approved Sale or Designated Merger and shall
be entitled to exercise such exercisable but unexercised portion of the Option
(including all options that become exercisable immediately prior to the Approved
Sale pursuant to Section 3(b) or the Designated Merger pursuant to Section
3(d)(i)) at any time during such ten (10) day period up to and until the close
of business on the day immediately preceding the date of consummation of such
Approved Sale or Designated Merger, and, notwithstanding Section 7 hereof, the
Exercise Price may, at the option of the Optionee, be paid in whole or in part
by delivery of shares of the Class B Common Stock owned by the Optionee (the
value of such shares delivered as payment of the Exercise Price shall be
determined based on and consistent with the value of the consideration to be
tendered in connection with such Approved Sale or Designated Merger), and upon
exercise of the Option the Option Shares shall be treated in the same manner as
the shares of any other holder of Class B Common Stock."

2. Attached hereto as Exhibit B is a true and correct copy of the Employment
Agreement.

(a) You agree that in the case of a Panthers Merger (as defined in Section 3(d)
hereof), the obligations of the parties under the Employment Agreement with

operating position, in either case of the entity ("Parent") issuing shares of
its capital stock in connection with such Panthers Merger, and (ii) perform such
duties as are appropriate to such office and not inconsistent therewith as may
be assigned to you by the board of directors of Parent; provided, that Holdings
or Parent shall have provided to you prior to the closing of such Panthers
Merger a written notice specifying the title, nature and initial duties (which
you understand may change) of such position (the "Position Notice"), and you
shall have until the date occurring 14 days after the date you receive the
Position Notice to reject such position (the "Response Date").

(b) (i) You agree that in the case of Holdings entering into a merger agreement

which case this Section 2(b)(ii) shall apply instead of Section 2(b)(i), and the
"Transition Period" shall be the period from the date you provide written notice
to Holdings of the exercise of your option (the "Option Notice") until the date
occurring 15 days after the closing of such Panthers Merger. In such event, for
the Transition Period or, if longer, for 120 days after the date of the Option
Notice, but in either case no later than the date you acquire a new residence in
the vicinity of Parent, IWO will lease on your behalf an executive residential
quarters in the vicinity of Parent at a cost no greater than $2,500.00 per
month. In addition, for the Transition Period, IWO will lease on your behalf an
executive residential quarters in the vicinity of Holdings at a cost no greater

expenses incurred by you in commuting to and from such quarters to your
residence or quarters, as the case may be, in the vicinity of Parent no more

Holdings entering into such merger agreement, you agree to enter into the
Transition Relocation Expense Agreement attached as Exhibit C, pursuant to which
IWO will provide to you approximately $100,000 of relocation money subject to
the terms and conditions contained therein.

(c) You agree that in the case that Holdings enters into a merger agreement with
respect to a Panthers Merger, the closing of such Panthers Merger does not occur
for any reason and you have relocated to a new residence in the vicinity of the
headquarters of Parent pursuant to Section 2(b) hereof, you will relocate to a
residence in the vicinity of the headquarters of Holdings no later than July 31,
2001 (the "Re-Transition Period"). In such event, for the Re- Transition Period
or, if earlier, until the date you acquire a new residence in the vicinity of
