     FOR VALUE RECEIVED, the undersigned, ANALEX CORPORATION, a Delaware
corporation, formerly known as Hadron, Inc. (the "Borrower"), promises to pay to
the order of BANK OF AMERICA, N.A. (the "Lender") on or before the Revolving
Credit Facility Maturity Date, and at such earlier dates as may be required by
the Agreement (as defined below), the aggregate unpaid principal amount of all
Revolving Credit Facility Loans made by the Lender to the Borrower from time to
time pursuant to the Agreement. The Borrower further promises to pay to the
order of the Lender interest on the unpaid principal amount hereof from time to
time outstanding at the rate or rates per annum determined pursuant to the
Agreement, payable on the dates set forth in the Agreement.

     This Note is the "Revolving Credit Facility Note" referred to in, and is
entitled to the benefits of, the Credit Agreement, dated as of November 2, 2001

which among other things provides for the acceleration of the maturity hereof
upon the occurrence of certain events and for prepayments in certain
circumstances and upon certain terms and conditions. Terms defined in the
Agreement have the same meanings herein.

     If the Borrower fails to make any payment under this Note within seven days
after the due date, the Borrower shall pay the Lender a late charge of five
percent of the amount of the payment.

     This Note is secured by and is entitled to the benefits of the Liens
granted by the Security Agreement referred to in the Agreement.

     The Borrower hereby expressly waives presentment, demand, protest and all
other demands and notices (except as otherwise provided in the Agreement) in

this Note and the Agreement, and an action for amounts due hereunder or
thereunder shall immediately accrue, in each case except as otherwise expressly
provided in the Agreement.
