to make a long-term contribution to the success of the Company with appropriate incentives and rewards to encourage them to enter into and continue in the employ of the Company and/or to
acquire a proprietary interest in the long-term success of the Company, thereby aligning their interest more closely to the interest of stockholders. </FONT></P>

Stock so designated shall be based on the attainment by the Company (or a Subsidiary or division of the Company if applicable) of performance goals pre-established by the Committee, based
on one or more of the following criteria: (i)&nbsp;the attainment of a specified percentage return on total stockholder equity of the Company; (ii)&nbsp;the attainment of a specified percentage
increase in earnings per share of Common Stock; (iii)&nbsp;the attainment of a specified percentage increase in net income of the Company; and (iv)&nbsp;the attainment of a specified percentage
increase in profit before taxation of the Company (or a Subsidiary or division of the Company if applicable). Attainment of any such performance criteria shall be determined in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles as in effect from time to time. Such shares shall be released from restrictions only after the attainment of such performance measures have been certified by
