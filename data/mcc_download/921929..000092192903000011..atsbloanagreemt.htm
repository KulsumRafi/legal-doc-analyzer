Tranche B-1 and Tranche B-2, the "<u>Tranches</u>" and each a "<u>Tranche</u>").

                  Any amount of the Loan repaid or prepaid may not be reborrowed.  The
obligation of each Lender to participate in the making of the Loan up to its respective amount
specified above on the terms and conditions hereof is hereinafter called its "<u>Commitment</u>."  The
Commitments of the Lenders are several and no Lender shall be responsible for any other
Lender's failure to make available its Commitments as required.

<b>SECTION 2.2</b>.      <u>BORROWING PROCEDURES</u>.
(a)      The Borrowing shall be made on notice given by the Borrower to the Agent not later than
11:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the Business Day prior to the proposed Closing Date.  Such notice
shall be in substantially the form of Exhibit C (a "<u>Notice of Borrowing</u>"), specifying (A) the
proposed Closing Date and (B) the aggregate amount of the proposed Borrowing.  The Notice of Borrowing
shall be irrevocable, and duly executed and delivered on behalf of the Borrower by its Chief
Financial Officer or President/Chief Executive Officer.
(b)      The Agent shall give to the Lenders, each Supplemental Guarantor and the Loan Administrator

p.m. (New York City time) on the date of the proposed Borrowing, make available to the Agent as
per the Payment Instructions for the Agent set forth on Annex A hereto, in immediately
available funds, an amount equal to its Commitment.  After the Agent's receipt of such funds
and upon fulfillment or waiver of the applicable conditions set forth in SECTION 3.1, the Agent
will make such funds available to the Borrower.

<b>SECTION 2.3</b>.      <u>SCHEDULED REPAYMENT OF THE LOAN</u>.  The Borrower shall repay the Loan
in fourteen (14) consecutive quarterly installments of $2,642,857.14 on the last Business Day of each

together with a final payment of $33,000,000.04 on the Loan Maturity Date; provided that, the
Borrower shall repay the entire unpaid principal amount of the Loan together with accrued and
unpaid interest thereon and all other amounts owing hereunder in respect thereof on the Loan
Maturity Date.

<b>SECTION 2.4</b>.      <u>EVIDENCE OF DEBT; USE OF PROCEEDS</u>.
(a)      Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts
evidencing such Lender's portion of the Loan outstanding from time to time, including the amounts
of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time under this Agreement.
(b)      The Agent shall establish and maintain a register for recording with respect to the Loan
(i) the date and amount of each payment on the Loan made by or on behalf of, or collected from, the
Borrower, (ii) the amount of each such payment applied in accordance with each clause of
paragraphs (d) and (e) of SECTION 2.9 or other applicable terms hereof to scheduled principal
of or interest on the Loan and to each of the fees payable after the Closing Date identified in
paragraphs (a) through (d) of SECTION 2.8 hereof, and (iii) the date and amount of each payment
made by the Board under the Board Guarantee.
(c)      The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to clauses (A) and (B) of this SECTION
2.4 shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, be prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts
of the obligations recorded therein; <u>provided, however</u>, that the failure of any Lender or the
Agent to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the
obligations of the Borrower to repay the Loan in accordance with its terms.
(d)      The Borrower shall execute and deliver to the Agent on the Closing Date (i) a promissory note
substantially in the form of Exhibit B1 in the principal amount of Tranche A of the Loan, dated
the Closing Date and otherwise appropriately completed (such note, including any replacement
note therefor issued in accordance with the provisions of this SECTION 2.4(D), the "<u>Tranche A</u>
<u>Note</u>"), (ii) (A) a promissory note substantially in the form of Exhibit B2-1 in the principal
amount of Tranche B-1 of the Loan, dated the Closing Date and otherwise appropriately completed
(such note, including any replacement note therefor issued in accordance with the provisions of
this SECTION 2.4(D), the "<u>Tranche B-1 Note</u>") and (B)  a promissory note substantially in the
form of Exhibit B2-2 in the principal amount of Tranche B-2 of the Loan, dated the Closing Date
and otherwise appropriately completed (such note, including any replacement note therefor
issued in accordance with the provisions of this SECTION 2.4(D), the "<u>Tranche B-2 Note</u>")  and
(iii)  a promissory note substantially in the form of Exhibit B3 in the aggregate principal
amount of Tranche C of the Loan, dated the Closing Date and otherwise appropriately completed
(such note, including any replacement note therefor issued in accordance with the provisions of
this SECTION 2.4(D), the "<u>Tranche C Note</u>" and, collectively, together with the Tranche A Note,
the Tranche B-1 Note and the Tranche B-2 Note, the "<u>Notes</u>").  The Notes shall be made payable
to the Agent at the office of the Agent.  If any Note is mutilated, lost, stolen or destroyed,
the Borrower shall issue a new Note in the same principal amount and having the same interest
rate, date and maturity as the Note so mutilated, lost, stolen or destroyed endorsed to
indicate all payments thereon.  In the case of any lost, stolen or destroyed Note, there shall
first be furnished to the Borrower and the Board or the applicable Supplemental Guarantor an
instrument of indemnity from the Agent and evidence of such loss, theft or destruction
reasonably satisfactory to each of them, together with an Officer's Certificate of the Borrower
certifying and warranting as to the due authorization, execution and delivery of the new Note.
(e)      This Agreement and the Notes are registered instruments.  A manually signed copy of this
Agreement and the original of a Note shall be evidence of (i) the rights of each Lender under this
Agreement and such Note and (ii) the rights of the Agent under this Agreement.  Neither this Agreement
nor any Note is a bearer instrument.  The Agent will establish and maintain a record of
ownership (the "<u>Register</u>") in which the Agent agrees to register by book entry the Agent's and
each Lender's interest in the Loan, the Notes and this Agreement, and in the right to receive
any payments hereunder or thereunder and any assignment of any such interest or rights. In
connection with any assignment pursuant to SECTION 10.2, the Agent shall maintain a copy of
each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to and accepted by it and shall record the names and
addresses of the Lenders and principal amount of each Tranche of the Loan owing to each Lender
from time to time.  The entries in the Register shall be conclusive and binding for all
purposes, absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the Board, the Agent and the Lenders may
treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register as a Lender for all purposes of this
Agreement.  Any assignment of all or part of any Loan shall be effective only upon appropriate
entries with respect thereto being made in the Register.  The Register shall be available for
inspection by the Borrower, the Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Board, the Loan Administrator
or any Lender or Supplemental Guarantor at any reasonable time and from time to time upon
reasonable prior notice.
(f)      The Borrower may use the proceeds from the Loan for such general corporate purposes as are
permissible under the Act and Regulations.  No portion of the proceeds from the Borrowing shall be
used by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries in any manner that might cause the borrowing or the
application of such proceeds to violate Regulation U, Regulation T or Regulation X of the
Federal Reserve Board or any other regulation of the Federal Reserve Board or to violate
Section 7(c) of the Exchange Act, in each case as in effect on the date or dates of such
borrowing and such use of proceeds.

<b>SECTION 2.5</b>.      <u>OPTIONAL PREPAYMENTS</u>.

to the Board, the Supplemental Guarantors, the Loan Administrator and the Agent stating the proposed

elect to prepay the outstanding principal amount of the Loan, ratably as to each Tranche, in
whole or in part (but not less than a minimum amount of $1,000,000), together with accrued
interest to the date of such prepayment on the principal amount prepaid; <b>provided, however</b>,
that if any prepayment of all or a portion of the Loan is made by the Borrower other than on an
Interest Payment Date or if the Borrower fails to make such payment on the date specified on
its notice, the Borrower shall also pay any amounts owing pursuant to SECTION 2.10(E).
(b)      Upon the giving of any notice of prepayment under clause (a) of this SECTION 2.5, the principal
amount of the Loan specified to be prepaid together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon shall
become due and payable on the date specified for such prepayment; <u>provided, however</u>, that any
failure to make any such prepayment in full on such date shall be deemed to be an automatic
revocation of the notice of prepayment given under SECTION 2.5(A) and such failure shall not
constitute a Default or an Event of Default hereunder; <u>provided, further, however</u>, that the
Borrower shall be obligated to pay on such date any amounts owing under SECTION 2.10(E) due to
such failure to prepay.
(c)      Any such prepayment shall be paid to the Agent for application as provided in SECTION 2.9, and any
partial prepayment of the Loan resulting from such application shall be applied to the then
remaining installments of the outstanding principal amount of the Loan (ratably as to each
Tranche) in the inverse order of maturity thereof.  The Borrower shall have no right to
optionally prepay the principal amount of the Loan other than as provided in this SECTION 2.5,
SECTION 2.10(B) or SECTION 2.10(D).

advisors' fees, any underwriting discounts and commissions and other costs incurred in
connection with such transaction (provided that evidence of such fees, discounts, commissions
and costs is provided to the Board and the Agent) ("<u>Net Issue Proceeds</u>"); <u>provided</u>, that,
the Borrower shall not be obligated to so prepay the Loan if and to the extent that (i) the
proceeds are from ARE Acquisition Financing, or (ii) the Borrower applies such proceeds from an
issuance or incurrence of Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness to repay the then outstanding
principal amount of the refinanced Old Indebtedness and to pay accrued and unpaid interest,
premiums and fees thereon; or (iii) the Future Issuance is an incurrence of Indebtedness for
the sole purpose of repaying existing Indebtedness that is required to be repaid under the
terms of the existing Indebtedness that (x) require prepayment because of any law that has made
it illegal for the lender thereof to continue to maintain the existing Indebtedness or (y)
permit prepayment in the event of the imposition of increased costs, withholding taxes or other
similar amounts (after required mitigation efforts have not been successful) or similar
occurrences or conditions; and <u>provided, further</u>, that, (iv) with respect to each Future
Issuance of Capital Stock, the Borrower shall be obligated to prepay the Loan only in an amount
equal to 60% of the Net Issue Proceeds therefrom, (v) with respect to each incurrence of
Indebtedness from which the Net Issue Proceeds will be applied to refinance ARE Acquisition
Financing or Indebtedness that refinanced ARE Acquisition Financing, but which does not satisfy
all of the applicable conditions set forth in the definition of Permitted Refinancing
Indebtedness, the Borrower shall be obligated to prepay the Loan in an amount equal to (A) 25%
of the Net Issue Proceeds therefrom, plus (B) each dollar in excess of such 25% amount that is
not used to refinance such Indebtedness, up to a maximum amount 75% of such Net Issue Proceeds,
except that if the Refinancing Indebtedness does not satisfy all conditions of such definition
solely because the principal amount exceeds the Permitted Refinancing Cap, the Borrower shall
be obligated to prepay the loan only in an amount equal to 75% of the amount of the Net Issue
Proceeds in excess of the Permitted Refinancing Cap, and (vi) with respect to each incurrence
of Indebtedness not otherwise contemplated above in this Section 2.6(a), the Borrower shall be
obligated to prepay the Loan only in an amount equal to 75% of the Net Issue Proceeds
therefrom.  Any such prepayment of the Loan shall be made on the date of receipt of the
proceeds of the applicable Future Issuance; <u>provided</u>, however, in all cases, that if prepayment
at such time would cause the Borrower to incur Breakage Costs, the Borrower may, by delivery of
written notice to the Agent, elect to deposit the amount that it would otherwise prepay at such
time in the Prepayment Account established under Section 6.06 of the Security Agreement, for
application on the next Interest Payment Date in manner provided in the second sentence of
Section 2.6(f) below.
(b)      <u>Asset Sales</u>.  In the event and to the extent that on any date after the Closing Date the

Wholly-Owned Subsidiary of the Borrower) in excess of $2,500,000 during any Fiscal Year (such
excess amount, "<u>Excess Proceeds</u>") then the Borrower shall, or shall cause such Subsidiary to,
prepay the Loan in an aggregate amount equal to such Excess Proceeds; <u>provided</u>, however, that
during the existence of a Value Differential, all Net Cash Proceeds received from Asset Sales
shall be applied to prepay the Loan without regard to the $2,500,000 retention amount
referenced above.  Any such prepayment of the Loan shall be made on the third Business Day
following the date on which the Excess Proceeds are received; <u>provided</u>, however, in all cases,
that if prepayment at such time would cause the Borrower to incur Breakage Costs, the Borrower
may, by delivery of written notice to the Agent, elect to deposit the amount that it would
otherwise prepay at such time in the Prepayment Account established under Section 6.06 of the
Security Agreement, for application on the next Interest Payment Date in manner provided in the
second sentence of Section 2.6(f) below.
(c)      <u>Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds</u>.  The Borrower shall prepay the Loan in an amount equal
to the amount by which the aggregate amount of all Net Insurance Proceeds and Net Condemnation Proceeds
received by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries in any Fiscal Year exceeds $2,500,000, not counting
amounts prepaid under the immediately following proviso; <u>provided</u>, that with respect to
proceeds from an Event of Loss of a Spare Engine (as such terms are defined in the Security
Agreement) if the Borrower does not pledge appropriate substitute Collateral in accordance with
the terms of Section 3.01 of the Security Agreement, the Borrower shall apply all such proceeds
to prepay the Loan; and <u>provided</u> further that the Borrower shall not be obligated to prepay the
Loan from Net Insurance Proceeds or Net Condemnation Proceeds if and to the extent that the
Borrower certifies to the Board that the recipient intends to repair, restore or replace the
assets from which such Net Insurance Proceeds or Net Condemnation Proceeds derived, and does so
(or enters into a definitive agreement committing to do so) within 6 months after receipt of
such Net Insurance Proceeds or Net Condemnation Proceeds (or in the case of proceeds derived
from Collateral, the Borrower uses such proceeds to repair, restore or replace the assets from
which such proceeds derived in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Security
Agreement).  Any prepayment pursuant to this SECTION 2.6(C) shall be made on the third Business
Day following the date of receipt of the Net Insurance Proceeds or Net Condemnation Proceeds in
excess of the specified level by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or if later, the
six-month period referenced above (or such later date as it is determined that the proceeds
will not be applied in accordance with an agreement entered into within such six-month period),
or in the case of proceeds derived from Collateral and for which the timing of prepayment is
otherwise provided for in the Security Agreement, at such time as determined in accordance with
the applicable provisions thereof; <u>provided</u>, however, in all cases, that if prepayment at such
time would cause the Borrower to incur Breakage Costs, the Borrower may, by delivery of written
notice to the Agent, elect to deposit the amount that it would otherwise prepay at such time in
the Prepayment Account established under Section 6.06 of the Security Agreement, for
application on the next Interest Payment Date in manner provided in the second sentence of
Section 2.6(f) below.

the Borrower shall promptly give the Agent, the Lenders, the Loan Administrator and the Board
written notice thereof, and the Board shall have the right, by written notice to the Borrower
(with a copy to the Agent and each Lender) delivered not more than 30 days following delivery
of the notice of the Change in Control, to require the Borrower to prepay the Loan in full,
together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the date of such prepayment, on the date
specified in such notice (which date shall be a Business Day not less than ten nor more than
twenty Business Days' after the date of such notice), and upon the specified payment date, the
Borrower shall so prepay the then outstanding principal amount of the Loan together with such
accrued and unpaid interest thereon.
(e)      <u>Pledged Tax Receivable Proceeds</u>.  The Borrower shall promptly give the Agent, the Lenders,
the Loan Administrator, the Supplemental Guarantors and the Board written notice of the Borrower's

thereof.  Promptly upon receipt of the Tax Refund but in any event no later than two (2)
Business Days after receipt thereof, the Borrower shall prepay the Loan in an amount equal to
the lesser of (i) one-hundred percent (100%) of the Tax Refund and (ii) $10,000,000; <u>provided</u>,
however, in all cases, that if prepayment at such time would cause the Borrower to incur
Breakage Costs, the Borrower may, by delivery of written notice to the Agent, elect to deposit
the amount that it would otherwise prepay at such time in the Prepayment Account established
under Section 6.06 of the Security Agreement, for application on the next Interest Payment Date
in manner provided in the second sentence of Section 2.6(f) below.  Upon the prepayment of the
Loan by the Borrower with the Tax Refund in accordance with the preceding sentence, the
Collateral Agent shall release its Lien on the balance (if any) of the Tax Refund and the
Pledged Tax Receivable.  The terms of subsection (f) hereof notwithstanding, the prepayment of
the Loan in accordance with this subsection (e) shall be applied to the then remaining
installments of the outstanding principal balance of the Loan (ratably as to each Tranche) in
the order of maturity thereof.
(f)      <u>Application</u>.  If any such prepayment is made by the Borrower other than on an Interest
Payment Date, the Borrower shall also pay any amounts owing pursuant to SECTION 2.10(E).  Any such
prepayment of the Loan shall be paid to the Agent for application as provided in SECTION 2.9, and any
partial prepayment of the Loan resulting from such application shall be applied to the then remaining
installments of the outstanding principal balance of the Loan (ratably as to each Tranche) in
the inverse order of maturity thereof.

part, and, if not previously paid in full, at maturity (whether by acceleration or otherwise).
Interest on each Tranche of the Loan shall be calculated on the basis of a year of 360 days and
actual number of days elapsed.
(e)      <u>Tranche A Default Interest</u>.  Notwithstanding the rate of interest specified in SECTION 2.7(A)

                  excess of the interest that would have accrued thereon at the Applicable Tranche A
                  Interest Rate, so much of such amount, if any, as exceeds the interest that would have
                  so accrued at the Applicable Tranche A Interest Rate shall be distributed to the Board
                  under this clause (ii) as if it were a Lender;
                (iii)    third, to pay principal then due and payable on the Loan to the Lenders, on a pro rata basis;
                 (iv)    fourth, to pay any fees then due and payable under Sections 2.8(a) and (b) hereof to the
                  Board and the Supplemental Guarantors on a pro rata basis; and

                  under clause (v) below), indemnities or other sums owing hereunder not referred to in clauses (iii)
                  and (iv) below then due to the Board, the Lenders and the Supplemental Guarantors, on
                  a pro rata basis;
                (iii)    third, to pay on a pro rata basis, (A) interest then due and payable in respect of the
                  Loan to the Lenders, on a pro rata basis, <u>provided that</u>, to the extent that any amount
                  received by the Agent constitutes interest accrued on any overdue principal of or interest on
                  Tranche A of the Loan in excess of the interest that would have accrued thereon at the
                  Applicable Tranche A Interest Rate, so much of such amount, if any, as exceeds the
                  interest that would have so accrued at the Applicable Tranche A Interest Rate shall be

                  payable to the Board under SECTION 2.8(B) and (C) fees payable to the Supplemental
                  Guarantors under SECTION 2.8(A);
                 (iv)     fourth, to pay or prepay principal payments on the Loan to the Lenders, on a pro rata

                  Board and the Supplemental Guarantors on a pro rata basis.
(f)      Upon the assignment to the Board of the Tranche A Lender's right, title and interest in and to its pro
rata portion of the principal of and interest on Tranche A of the Loan in accordance with the
Board Guarantee, the Board shall have the rights and privileges of a Lender with respect to
such payment (to the extent of the interests in Tranche A of the Loan so assigned to the
Board).
(g)      No payment by the Board to the Agent or the Tranche A Lender under the Board Guarantee shall
reduce, discharge, satisfy, modify or terminate the corresponding payment or any other obligation of
Borrower under this Agreement or the Tranche A Note, which shall remain in full force and
effect, and no payment by the Supplemental Guarantor to the Agent or Tranche B-1 Lender or
Tranche B-2 Lender under a Supplemental Guarantee shall reduce, discharge, satisfy, modify or
terminate the corresponding payment or any other obligation of Borrower under this Agreement or
the Tranche B-1 Note or Tranche B-2 Note, which shall remain in full force and effect.

<b>SECTION 2.10</b>.     <u>CERTAIN PROVISIONS GOVERNING THE NOTES</u>.

(a)      <u>Determination of Interest Rate</u>.  The Applicable Tranche A Interest Rate, the Applicable
Tranche B-1 Interest Rate, the Applicable Tranche B-2 Interest Rate and the Applicable Tranche C
Interest Rate for each Interest Period of the Loan shall be determined by the Agent pursuant to the
procedures set forth in the definition of "Applicable Tranche A Interest Rate," "Applicable
Tranche B-1 Interest Rate," "Applicable Tranche B-2 Interest Rate," "Applicable Tranche C
Interest Rate" and "LIBOR," as applicable, and shall promptly thereafter be notified to the
Borrower, the Board, the Loan Administrator, each Lender and each Supplemental Guarantor.
(b)      <u>Interest Rate Unascertainable, Inadequate or Unfair</u>.  In the event that:
(i) the Agent determines that adequate and fair means do not exist for ascertaining the
applicable interest rates by reference to which the LIBOR then being determined is to be fixed;
or (ii) the Requisite Lenders notify the Agent that the LIBOR for any Interest Period will not
adequately reflect the cost to the Lenders of making or maintaining the Loan for such Interest
Period, the Agent shall forthwith so notify the Borrower, the Board, the Supplemental
Guarantors and the Lenders, whereupon during the 30 days following the date of any such notice
the Lenders, the Agent and the Borrower shall negotiate in good faith (subject to the consent
of the Board and the Supplemental Guarantors) in order to arrive at a mutually acceptable
alternative basis for determining the interest rate from time to time applicable to the
relevant Tranche or Tranches of the Loan (the "<u>Substitute Basis</u>").  If within the 20 days
following the date of any such notice from the Agent, the Lenders, the Agent and the Borrower
shall agree upon, and the Board and the Supplemental Guarantors shall consent to, a Substitute
Basis, such Substitute Basis shall be retroactive to and effective from the first day of the
then current Interest Period until and including the last day of such Interest Period.  If
after 20 days from the date of such notice, the Lenders, the Agent and the Borrower shall have
failed to agree upon, or the Board or the Supplemental Guarantors shall have failed to consent
to, a Substitute Basis, then the Agent (upon instructions from the Requisite Lenders) shall
certify in writing to the Borrower (such certification to be conclusive and binding on all
Lenders and all other parties hereto absent manifest error) the interest rate at which the
Lenders are prepared to maintain their portion of the Loan for such Interest Period, it being
understood that such Lenders' interest rate shall be at a rate per annum equal to a rate which
adequately and fairly reflects the cost to such Lenders of obtaining the funds necessary to
maintain their portion of the Loan for such Interest Period.  If no Substitute Basis is
established, upon receipt of notice of the interest rates at which the Requisite Lenders are
prepared to maintain their respective portion of the Loan, the Borrower shall have the right
exercisable upon ten Business Days' prior notice to the Lenders, the Supplemental Guarantors
and the Board through the Agent (i) to continue to borrow the Loan at the interest rate so
advised by the Agent (as such rate may be modified, from time to time, at the outset of each
subsequent Interest Period) or (ii) to prepay on at least three Business Day's prior
irrevocable notice in full the Loan together with accrued but unpaid interest thereon at the
interest rate certified in writing by the Requisite Lenders as provided above and all other
amounts due under the Loan Documents, whereupon the Loan shall become due and payable on the
date specified by the Borrower in such notice.
(c)      <u>Increased Costs</u>.  If at any time any Lender or Supplemental Guarantor shall determine
that as a result of the introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation by any Governmental
Authority of any law, treaty or governmental rule, regulation or order after the date hereof or the
compliance by such Lender or Supplemental Guarantor with any guideline, request or directive
after the date hereof from any central bank or other Governmental Authority (whether or not
having the force of law), there shall be any increase in the cost to such Lender or
Supplemental Guarantor of agreeing to make or making, funding or maintaining any portion of the
Loan or its Supplemental Guarantee (except in respect of Taxes, payments with respect to which
are addressed in SECTION 2.12) (an "<u>Increased Cost</u>"), then the Borrower shall from time to
time, upon demand (which demand shall be accompanied by a statement setting forth the basis for
such demand and a calculation of the amount thereof in reasonable detail) by such Lender or
Supplemental Guarantor (with a copy of such demand to the Agent), pay to the Agent for account
of such Lender or Supplemental Guarantor additional amounts sufficient to compensate such
Lender or Supplemental Guarantor for such increased cost.  A certificate as to the amount of
such increased cost (which certificate shall state that increased costs are being demanded of
the Borrower by such Lender or Supplemental Guarantor on a nondiscriminatory basis, consistent
with other requests being made by such Lender or Supplemental Guarantor in connection with
other similar loans held (or in the case of a Supplemental Guarantor, credit supports provided)
by such Lender or Supplemental Guarantor), submitted to the Borrower and the Agent by such
Lender or Supplemental Guarantor shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent
manifest error; <u>provided, however</u>, that if any Lender or Supplemental Guarantor fails to give
such certificate 90 days after it obtains knowledge of the event giving rise to such Increased
Cost, such Lender or Supplemental Guarantor shall, with respect to amounts payable pursuant to
this SECTION 2.10(C) resulting from such event, be entitled to payment under this SECTION
2.10(C) for amounts incurred only from and after the date 90 days prior to the date that such
does give such notice.  In addition upon the receipt of any notice of an Increased Cost, the
affected Lender, the Supplemental Guarantor and the Borrower shall consult in good faith and
each shall use its reasonable efforts to avoid or mitigate the amount of any Increased Cost,
including without limitation, by assigning the rights and obligations of the Lender or
Supplemental Guarantor hereunder to another office or branch of such Lender or Supplemental
Guarantor or in the case of a Lender, by selling or transferring (for the Mitigation Price) the
rights, interests and obligations of the affected Lender hereunder to another bank, financial
or lending institution identified by the Borrower, subject to the terms hereof, that would not
be subject to any such Increased Cost, provided that such Lender or Supplemental Guarantor
shall not be required to take such action to avoid or mitigate such Increased Cost hereunder if
such action would result in any material economic, legal or regulatory disadvantage, or any
adverse tax consequence to such Lender or Supplemental Guarantor (other than (i) economic
disadvantage for which the Borrower agrees to indemnify such Lender or Supplemental Guarantor
on an After-Tax Basis and in a manner reasonably acceptable to such Lender or Supplemental
Guarantor, or (ii) adverse tax consequences for which the Borrower agrees to indemnify such
Lender or Supplemental Guarantor on an After-Tax Basis and in a manner reasonably acceptable to
such Lender or Supplemental Guarantor).  In the event the amount of such Increased Costs can
not be avoided or mitigated, or such Notes are not transferred as contemplated by the prior
sentence, the Borrower may prepay such affected portion of the Loan held by the affected Lender
(or guaranteed by the affected Supplemental Guarantor) at par, together with accrued but unpaid
interest thereon, any amounts payable in accordance with SECTION 2.10(E) and all other sums
payable hereunder (the "<u>Mitigation Price</u>") with respect thereto on any Business Day selected by
the Borrower.
(d)      <u>Illegality</u>.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if any Lender
determines that the introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation by any Governmental
Authority of any law, treaty or governmental rule, regulation or order after the date of this Agreement
shall make it unlawful, or any central bank or other Governmental Authority shall assert that it is
unlawful, for such Lender to continue to fund or maintain its portion of the Loan, then, on
notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower through the Agent, the obligation of such Lender
to maintain its portion of the Loan shall be terminated and the Borrower shall prepay such
affected portion of the Loan to such Lender, together with accrued but unpaid interest thereon
and all other sums payable hereunder with respect thereto on the last day of the then current
Interest Period or earlier if necessary to avoid such illegality; <u>provided that</u>,
notwithstanding the foregoing, upon the receipt of any notice of any such illegality, the
affected Lender and the Borrower shall consult in good faith and each shall use its reasonable
efforts to avoid or mitigate such illegality, including without limitation, by adjusting the
interest rate basis for the affected portion of such Loan (with an interest rate margin to be
agreed), if doing so would avoid such illegality or by assigning the rights and obligations of
the Lender hereunder to another office or branch of such Lender or by selling or transferring
(for the Mitigation Price) the rights, interests and obligations of the affected Lender
hereunder to another bank, financial or lending institution identified by the Borrower, subject
to terms hereof, that would not be subject to such illegality, provided that such Lender shall
not be required to take such action to avoid such illegality if such action would result in any
material economic, legal or regulatory disadvantage, or any adverse tax consequence to such
Lender (other than (i) economic disadvantage for which the Borrower agrees to indemnify such
Lender on an After-Tax Basis and in a manner reasonably acceptable to such Lender, or (ii)
adverse tax consequences for which the Borrower agrees to indemnify such Lender on an After-Tax
Basis and in a manner reasonably acceptable to such Lender).  In the event such illegality
cannot be avoided, or such Notes are not transferred as contemplated by the prior sentence, the
Borrower may prepay such affected portion of the Loan held by the affected Lender at the
Mitigation Price with respect thereto on any Business Day selected by the Borrower.  Any such
prepayment of the Loan shall be paid to the Agent for application as provided in SECTION 2.9,
and any such partial prepayment resulting from such application shall be applied ratably to the
then unpaid installments thereof in accordance with the amount of each such unpaid installment.
(e)      <u>Breakage Costs</u>.  In addition to all amounts required to be paid by the Borrower
pursuant to SECTION 2.7, the Borrower shall compensate each Lender or each Supplemental Guarantor
upon demand, for all losses, expenses and liabilities (including any loss or expense incurred by
reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by such Lender or
Supplemental Guarantor or the termination of any other financial arrangement it may have entered
into to fund or maintain or support such Lender's portion of the Loan or its Supplemental Guarantee
through the conclusion of the applicable Interest Period but excluding Taxes, payments with
respect to which are addressed in SECTION 2.12) which such Lender or Supplemental Guarantor may
sustain (but excluding any loss of profit) (i) if for any reason the proposed Borrowing does
not occur on a date specified therefor in the Notice of Borrowing given by a Borrower, (ii) if
for any reason any portion of the Loan is prepaid (or required to be sold) on other than the
last day of an Interest Period or with less than three Business Days' notice (including
mandatorily pursuant to SECTION 2.6 or this SECTION 2.10), or (iii) as a consequence of any
failure by a Borrower to repay or prepay any portion of the Loan when required by the terms
hereof or irrevocable notice thereof has been furnished (any such losses, expenses and
liabilities referred to as "<u>Breakage Costs</u>").  The Lender or Supplemental Guarantor making
demand for such compensation shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the Agent)
concurrently with such demand a written statement as to such losses, expenses and liabilities,
and this statement shall be conclusive as to the amount of compensation due to that Lender or
Supplemental Guarantor absent manifest error, and such compensation shall be paid to the Agent
for account of such Lender or Supplemental Guarantor.

<b>SECTION 2.11</b>.     <u>CAPITAL ADEQUACY</u>.

If at any time any Lender or Supplemental Guarantor determines that (a) the
adoption of or any change in or in the interpretation by any Governmental Authority of any law,
treaty or governmental rule, regulation or order after the date of this Agreement regarding
capital adequacy, (b) compliance with any such law, treaty, rule, regulation, or order, or (c)
compliance with any guideline or request or directive from any central bank or other
Governmental Authority (whether or not having the force of law) shall have the effect of
reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or Supplemental Guarantor's (or any corporation
controlling such Lender's or Supplemental Guarantor's) capital as a consequence of this
Agreement and the portion of the Loan made available thereby to a level below that which such
Lender or Supplemental Guarantor or such corporation could have achieved but for such adoption,
change, compliance or interpretation, then, upon demand from time to time by such Lender or
Supplemental Guarantor (with a copy of such demand to the Agent), the Borrower shall pay to the
Agent for account of such Lender or Supplemental Guarantor from time to time as specified by
such Lender or Supplemental Guarantor additional amounts (the "<u>Additional Amounts</u>") sufficient
to compensate such Lender or Supplemental Guarantor for such reduction.  A certificate as to
such amounts (which certificate shall state that increased costs are being demanded of the
Borrower by such Lender or Supplemental Guarantor on a nondiscriminatory basis, consistent with
other requests being made by such Lender or Supplemental Guarantor in connection with other
similar loans (or in the case of a Supplemental Guarantor, other similar credit supports
provided) held by such Lender or Supplemental Guarantor) submitted to the Borrower and the
Agent by such Lender or Supplemental Guarantor shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes
absent manifest error; <u>provided, however</u>, that if any Lender or Supplemental Guarantor fails to
give such certificate 90 days after it obtains knowledge of the event giving rise to such
Additional Amount, such Lender or Supplemental Guarantor shall, with respect to amounts payable
pursuant to this SECTION 2.11 resulting from such event, be entitled to payment under this
SECTION 2.11 for amounts incurred only from and after the date 90 days prior to the date that
such does give such notice.  In addition upon the receipt of any notice of an Additional
Amount, the Borrower may require the affected Lender to sell or transfer (for the Mitigation
Price) the rights, interests and obligations of the affected Lender hereunder to another bank,
financial or lending institution identified by the Borrower, subject to the terms hereof, that
would not be subject to any such Additional Amount.  In the event the Loan of the affected
Lender or Supplemental Guarantor is not transferred as contemplated by the prior sentence, the
Borrower may prepay such affected portion of the Loan to the affected Lender (or guaranteed by
the affected Supplemental Guarantor), together with accrued but unpaid interest thereon and all
other sums payable hereunder with respect thereto on any Business Day selected by the Borrower
(subject to SECTION 2.10(E)).

<b>SECTION 2.12</b>.     <u>TAXES</u>.

(a)      Except as otherwise provided in SECTION 10.2 or required by applicable law, any and all
payments by the Borrower under each Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without
deduction for any and all Taxes, excluding (i) in the case of each Lender and each participant in
a Loan (hereinafter, a "participant"), the Loan Administrator, each Supplemental Guarantor and the
Agent, Taxes measured by its net income or net profits (or branch profits), and franchise Taxes
imposed on it, by the United States of America (or any political subdivision thereof) or by any
jurisdiction under the laws of which such Lender, the Loan Administrator, each such
Supplemental Guarantor or the Agent (as the case may be) is organized, (ii) in the case of each
Lender and each participant, Taxes measured by its net income or net profits (or branch
profits), and franchise Taxes imposed on it, by the jurisdiction in which such Lender's Lending
Office is located or in which such participant booked its participation for tax accounting
purposes, (iii) in the case of each Supplemental Guarantor, Taxes measured by its net income or
net profits (or branch profits), and franchise Taxes imposed on it, by the jurisdiction to
which the Borrower is directed to make payments to such Supplemental Guarantor pursuant to the
Loan Documents, (iv) in the case of each Lender, each participant, the Loan Administrator, the
Agent and either Supplemental Guarantor, Taxes imposed as a result of such Person failing to
comply with its obligations under SECTION 2.12(H) or SECTION 2.12(I) and (v) in the case of
each Lender, the Loan Administrator, each participant, each Supplemental Guarantor and the
Agent that is a party hereto, Supplemental Guarantor or participant, as the case may be, any
withholding Taxes imposed by the United States of America unless imposed as a result of a
change in applicable law or regulations, including income tax conventions, after the latest of
(x) the Closing Date, (y) the date on which it becomes a Lender, the Loan Administrator, a
Supplemental Guarantor, a participant or the Agent, as the case may be, and (z) in the case of
a Lender, the date on which it designates a new Lending Office, unless such designation is
pursuant to SECTION 2.12(I) (all such non-excluded Taxes being hereinafter referred to as
"<u>Indemnified Taxes</u>").  If any Indemnified Taxes shall be required by law to be deducted from or
in respect of any sum payable by the Borrower under any Loan Document to any Lender, the Loan
Administrator, any Supplemental Guarantor or the Agent (i) the sum payable shall be increased
as may be necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions
applicable to additional sums payable under this SECTION 2.12) such Lender, the Loan
Administrator, such Supplemental Guarantor or the Agent (as the case may be) receives an amount
equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Borrower
shall make such deductions, and (iii) the Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the
relevant taxing authority or other authority in accordance with applicable law.
(b)      If any Taxes are required by law to be deducted from or in respect of any sum payable under
any Supplemental Guarantee by any Supplemental Guarantor to the Agent, any Lender or any
participant and such Supplemental Guarantor in accordance with the terms of its Supplemental
Guarantee pays such amounts as may be necessary so that after making all required deductions
the Agent, such Lender or such participant, as the case may be, receives an amount equal to the
sum it would have received had no such deduction been made, the Borrower shall pay the amount
thereof to the Agent for the account of such Supplemental Guarantor (together with any
additional amounts such that the Supplemental Guarantor receives, after deduction for all Taxes
required to be withheld, the amount so paid by the Supplemental Guarantor).
(c)      In addition, the Borrower agrees to pay any present or future stamp or documentary Taxes
or any other excise or property Taxes (excluding Taxes described in Section 2.12(a)(i), (ii) or (iii)),
charges or similar levies of the United States or any political subdivision thereof or any
applicable foreign jurisdiction or subdivision thereof, and all liabilities with respect
thereto, which arise from any payment made under any Loan Document or Supplemental Guarantee or
from the execution, delivery or registration of, or otherwise with respect to, any Loan
Document or Supplemental Guarantee (collectively, "<u>Other Taxes</u>") to the Agent for the account
of the affected party.
(d)      The Borrower will indemnify each Lender, the Agent, the Loan Administrator and each
Supplemental Guarantor on an after-tax basis for the full amount of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes
(including any Taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this SECTION 2.12)
paid by such Lender, the Loan Administrator, the Agent or Supplemental Guarantor (as the case
may be) and any liability (including for penalties, interest and expenses) arising therefrom or
with respect thereto.  This indemnification shall be made to the Agent for account of the
relevant Lender, the Loan Administrator, the relevant Supplemental Guarantor or the Agent, as
the case may be, within 30 days from the date such Lender, the Loan Administrator, such
Supplemental Guarantor or the Agent (as the case may be) makes written demand therefor (with a
copy to the Agent if made by a Lender, the Loan Administrator or Supplemental Guarantor and
accompanied by a statement setting forth the basis for such taxation and the calculation of the
amount thereof in reasonable detail).
(e)      Within 30 days after the date of any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes, the
Borrower will furnish to the Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment
thereof or other documentation reasonably satisfactory to the Agent.
(f)      If a Lender, a Supplemental Guarantor, the Loan Administrator or the Agent determines, in
its sole discretion, that it has received a refund in respect of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes
as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrower pursuant to this SECTION 2.12, it shall within
30 days from the date of such receipt pay over such refund to the Borrower hereunder (but only
to the extent of indemnity payments made by the Borrower pursuant to this SECTION 2.12 with
respect to the Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of any
additional Taxes incurred due to such refund and out-of-pocket expenses of such Lender, such
Supplemental Guarantor, the Loan Administrator or the Agent as a result of such refund or
payment hereunder and without interest (other than interest paid by the relevant Governmental
Authority with respect to such refund); <u>provided</u>, that no Default which if not cured would
become an Event of Default under Sections 7.1(a), (f) or (g) or Event of Default is continuing,
and <u>provided further</u>, that the Borrower hereunder, upon the request of such Lender, such
Supplemental Guarantor or the Agent, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Borrower (plus
penalties, interest or other charges) to such Lender, such Supplemental Guarantor or the Agent
in the event such Lender, such Supplemental Guarantor or the Agent is required to repay such
refund to or if it is otherwise disallowed by such Governmental Authority.
(g)      Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement of the Borrower hereunder, the
agreements and obligations of the parties contained in this SECTION 2.12 shall survive the payment
in full of the Obligations.
(h)      Each of the Lenders, each Supplemental Guarantor, the Loan Administrator and the Agent that
is a Non-U.S. Person and that is entitled at such time to an exemption from United States
withholding tax, or that is subject to such tax at a reduced rate under an applicable tax
treaty, shall, on or prior to the Closing Date or on or prior to the date of the Assignment and
Acceptance pursuant to which it becomes a Lender or on or prior to the date such Person becomes
a Supplemental Guarantor, the Loan Administrator or the Agent, as applicable, and from time to
time thereafter if requested by the Agent, a Supplemental Guarantor or the Borrower or if
necessary to keep the provided forms from lapsing, provide the Agent and the Borrower, and, in
the case of each of the Lenders and the Agent, provide each Supplemental Guarantor, with two
completed copies of either IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI or other applicable form, certificate or
document prescribed by the IRS certifying as to such Non-U.S. Person's entitlement to such
exemption from United States withholding tax or reduced rate with respect to all payments to be
made to such Non-U.S. Person under the Loan Documents.  In addition, each of the Lenders, each
Supplemental Guarantor, the Loan Administrator and the Agent that is a Non-U.S. Person, as the
case may be, shall deliver to the Borrower and the Agent, and, in the case of each of the
Lenders and the Agent, deliver to each Supplemental Guarantor, notice of any event (other than
a change in applicable law, including income tax conventions) requiring a change in the most
recent form previously delivered by such Person to the Borrower and the Agent or the
Supplemental Guarantors, as the case may be.  Each participant in a Loan shall comply with the
requirements of this clause (h) as if it were a Lender, except that it shall only be required
to provide forms and notices to the Agent, or in conjunction with a written agreement delivered
pursuant to clause (j) hereof or a request for indemnification pursuant to this Section 2.12.
                  (i)      Any Lender claiming any additional amounts payable pursuant to this
                  SECTION 2.12 ("<u>Additional Tax Amounts</u>") shall use its reasonable efforts
                  (consistent with its internal policy and legal and regulatory restrictions) to change
                  the jurisdiction of its Lending Office if the making of such a change would avoid the
                  need for, or reduce the amount of, any such Additional Tax Amounts which would be payable
                  or may thereafter accrue and would not, in the sole determination of such Lender, be
                  disadvantageous to such Lender.  In addition, upon receipt by Borrower of any notice that
                  any Additional Tax Amounts are due, the affected Lender shall sell or transfer (for the
                  Mitigation Price) the rights, interests and obligations of the affected Lender hereunder
                  to another bank, financial or lending institution identified by the Borrower and approved
                  by the affected Supplemental Guarantor, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld,
                  subject to the terms hereof, that would not require that any such Additional Tax Amounts
                  be paid.  In the event such Additional Tax Amounts can not be avoided or mitigated, or such
                  Notes are not transferred as contemplated by the prior sentence, the Borrower may prepay
                  such affected portion of the Loan held by the affected Lender (or guaranteed by the affected
                  Supplemental Guarantor) at the Mitigation Price with respect thereto on any Business Day
                  selected by the Borrower.
(j)      Each participant in the Loan will be entitled to the benefits and subject to the requirements of this
SECTION 2.12 to the same extent as if such Person were a Lender; <u>provided</u> such participant
agrees in writing to be subject to all of the provisions of this SECTION 2.12; and provided,
<u>further</u>, that a participant shall not be entitled to indemnification or payment of additional
amounts under this SECTION 2.12 with respect to any Taxes which are in effect and would not
apply to amounts payable to the participating Lender on the date such participant acquires its
participation.  In addition, each Supplemental Guarantor seeking the benefits of this SECTION
2.12 must agree in writing to be subject to all of the provisions of this SECTION 2.12.

<b>SECTION 4.1.</b>      <u>ORGANIZATION, POWERS, QUALIFICATION, GOOD STANDING, BUSINESS, SUBSIDIARIES,
THE ACT AND THE REGULATIONS.</u>

laws of the State of Colorado.  The Borrower has all requisite corporate and other power and authority
to own and operate its properties, to carry on its business as now conducted and as proposed to
be conducted, to enter into the Loan Documents to which it is a party and to carry out the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.
(b)      The Borrower is qualified to do business and in good standing in every jurisdiction where its
assets are located and wherever necessary to carry out its business and operations, except in
jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing could not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.  The Borrower is an "air carrier" within the
meaning of the Act and holds a certificate under Sections 41102(a)(1) and 41103 of Title 49.
Each of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries engaged in operations as an "air carrier" is a
"citizen of the United States" as defined in Section 40102(a)(15) of Title 49 (a "<u>United States</u>
<u>Citizen</u>") and holds an air carrier operating certificate issued pursuant to Chapter 447 of
Title 49 for aircraft capable of carrying 10 or more individuals or 6,000 pounds or more of

franchises, licenses, permits, rights and concessions and consents which are material to the
operation of the routes flown by it and the conduct of its business and operations as currently
conducted.
(c)      All of the Subsidiaries of the Borrower as of the Closing Date are identified on Schedule
4.1(c), as said Schedule 4.1(c) may be supplemented from time to time pursuant to the provisions of
SECTION 5.15.  Each of the Subsidiaries identified in Schedule 4.1(c) (as so supplemented) is
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its respective
jurisdiction of formation set forth therein, has all requisite corporate, partnership or
limited liability power and authority to own and operate its properties and to carry on its

in good standing or a lack of such corporate, partnership or limited liability power and
authority could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.  Schedule 4.1(c)
(as so supplemented) correctly sets forth the ownership interest of the Borrower and each of
its Subsidiaries in each of the Subsidiaries identified therein.  There are no limitations on
the right of the Borrower to vote the Capital Stock it owns of any of its Subsidiaries.  Except
as otherwise described on Schedule 4.1(c), the Subsidiaries listed on Schedule 4.1(c) have no
assets or liabilities and have undertaken no operations except in connection with their

of the Act and the Regulations (it being understood that no representation is being made hereby
as to whether the Board has made any determinations or findings required to be made by it under
the Act and the Regulations as conditions to the issuance of the Board Guarantee).
(e)      The Borrower intends to use the proceeds of the Loan only for general corporate purposes as are

Loan Documents to which it is a party do not and will not (i) violate any provision of any law
or any governmental rule or regulation applicable to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries,

Subsidiaries or any order, judgment or decree of any court or other agency of government

consent or approval of, or notice to, or other action to, with or by, any federal, state or
other Governmental Authority or regulatory body or any other Person except as disclosed on
Schedule 4.2(c) and all of such registrations, consents, approvals, notices and other actions

the Regulations as conditions to the issuance of the Board Guarantee).

                  in providing the financial statements to the sub-servicer and attempting to procure
                  the report or indicative credit rating on behalf of the Requesting Party, or (y) if
                  the Loan Administrator is unable, after exercising reasonable care and good faith, to

               (viii)    at the written request of a Requesting Party and at the expense of the Borrower, visit
                  the Borrower and inspect the financial and accounting records and take extracts therefrom and
                  make relevant inquiries of each such Person so as to respond to specific questions from the
                  Requesting Party regarding such Person's financial condition and ability to perform
                  its respective obligations under the other Loan Documents;
                 (ix)    at the direction and expense of the Requesting Party, procure and coordinate the advice
                  of professional advisers necessary for such Requesting Party to perform its obligations and enforce
                  its rights under the Loan Documents;
                  (x)    analyze the Appraisal Reports submitted by the Borrower under the Loan Documents and
                  report to the Board regarding the Appraised Value of the Collateral reflected in such reports;

                  communications delivered by or on behalf of the Borrower hereunder;
                (xii)    based on certificates, notices, appraisals or other communications delivered by or on
                  behalf of the Borrower hereunder, monitor their compliance with covenants and agreements
                  relating to Collateral including Borrower's obligations to prepay the Loan in the amount of the
                  Value Differential;
               (xiii)    monitor Collateral-related regulatory and UCC filings to ensure that continuation statements,
                  extensions or renewals, as applicable, are timely filed;
                (xiv)    following an Event of Default, at the written request and expense of the Requesting Party,
                  assist and advise such Requesting Party in connection with the liquidation of the Collateral,
                  including selecting specialists to assist in appraisal and liquidation of collateral,
                  recommending liquidation strategies, identifying potential buyers of the assets and
                  analyzing bids; and
                 (xv)    subject to subsection (C) below, at the expense of the Requesting Party, take such
                  other actions as may be reasonably requested in writing by the Requesting Party in respect
                  of the Loan and the Loan Documents, such actions to be upon such terms and conditions as shall be
                  mutually agreed to by the Requesting Party and the Loan Administrator.
(c)      With respect to the Loan Administrator's responsibilities under SECTION 8.1(B) above, the Loan
Administrator shall not be required to take any action which exposes the Loan Administrator to
liability or which is contrary to this Agreement, any other Loan Document, the Board Guarantee
or applicable law.  The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Loan Administrator
shall not give rise to any implied duties or fiduciary obligations of the Loan Administrator to
any Requesting Party or any other Person.  The Board hereby acknowledges and agrees that the
failure of the Loan Administrator to perform any of its obligations hereunder shall not
invalidate or otherwise affect the Board Guarantee.
(d)      Except as permitted in subsection (B)(IV) ABOVE, the Loan Administrator shall not be permitted to
assign any of its obligations hereunder, enter into sub-servicing agreements or otherwise delegate any
of its duties under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the Requisite Lenders
and the Board.  The Loan Administrator hereby acknowledges and agrees that the fees and
expenses payable to any sub-servicer retained by it in accordance with this Agreement shall be
paid out of the fees payable by the Borrower to the Loan Administrator under SECTION 2.8(C).
(e)      The Loan Administrator may retain legal counsel (including counsel for the Loan Administrator),
independent public accountants and other experts or advisers as desirable to provide the
services set forth in SECTION 8.1(B), and shall be reimbursed by the Borrower for the
reasonable associated costs and such other reasonable expenses as the Loan Administrator shall
incur in providing such services.  The Borrower shall be responsible for such costs and
expenses with respect to the services set forth in SECTION 8.1(B)(VII) and (viii) hereof
(calculated in the manner set forth in SECTION 2.8(C)), and a Requesting Party shall be
responsible for the costs and expenses with respect to the services set forth in SECTION
8.1(B)(IX), (xiv) and (xv) if requested by such Requesting Party (calculated in the manner set
forth in SECTION 2.8(C)).
(f)      In the event that any of the Lenders or the Board shall request that the Loan Administrator provide
additional services to it under SECTION 8.1(B)(XIV) and (XV) or which are otherwise outside the
scope of the services to be provided by the Loan Administrator hereunder, the Loan
Administrator shall, to the extent it agrees to provide such additional services to such party,
be entitled to charge such party such additional fees in accordance with SECTION 2.8(C).
Unless otherwise agreed to by such Person and the Loan Administrator, the terms and conditions
of this ARTICLE VIII shall apply to the provision by the Loan Administrator of such additional
services to such party.

<b>SECTION 8.2</b>.      <u>LOAN ADMINISTRATOR'S RELIANCE</u>.

(a)      The Loan Administrator shall be entitled to rely upon any note, notice, consent, certificate,
affidavit, letter, telegram, teletype message, facsimile transmission, statement, order or other document
in good faith believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed or sent by the
proper person or persons and, in respect of legal matters, upon the opinion of counsel selected
by the Loan Administrator.
(b)      Neither the Loan Administrator nor any of its directors, officers, agents, employees or its
sub-servicer shall be liable to any Lender, the Board or any Supplemental Guarantor for any action
taken or omitted to be taken by it or by such directors, officers, agents or employees under or in
connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, except for its or their own gross
negligence or willful misconduct.  Without limitation of the generality of the foregoing, the
Loan Administrator:  (i) may consult with legal counsel, independent public accountants and
other experts selected by it and shall not be liable to any Lender, any Supplemental Guarantor
or the Board for any action taken or omitted to be taken in good faith by it in accordance with
the advice of such experts; (ii) except as provided in SECTION 8.1(B) above, shall not have any
duty to ascertain or to inquire as to the performance or observance of any of the terms,
covenants or conditions of this Agreement, the Notes or any other Loan Document on the part of
the Borrower or to inspect the property (including the books and records) of the Borrower or
any of its Subsidiaries; (iii) except as otherwise provided in this ARTICLE VIII, shall not be
responsible to any Lender, any Supplemental Guarantor or the Board for the due execution,
legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of this Agreement, the
Notes or any other Loan Document, or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant
thereto; and (iv) shall incur no liability under or in respect to this Agreement, the Notes or
any other Loan Document by acting upon any notice, consent, certificate or other instrument or
writing (which may be by telegram, facsimile transmission, cable or telex) in good faith
believed by it to be genuine and signed or sent by the proper party or parties.
(c)      IN NO EVENT SHALL THE LOAN ADMINISTRATOR, ITS EMPLOYEES, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, AGENTS OR ITS
SUB-SERVICER BE LIABLE FOR CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY
DAMAGES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR LOSSES (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOST PROFITS AND OPPORTUNITY
COSTS).  THE LENDERS, THE SUPPLEMENTAL GUARANTORS AND THE BOARD AGREE THAT THE LOAN
ADMINISTRATOR, ITS EMPLOYEES, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, AGENTS AND ITS SUB-SERVICER SHALL NOT BE
LIABLE TO THE LENDERS, THE SUPPLEMENTAL GUARANTORS AND THE BOARD FOR ANY ACTIONS, DAMAGES,
CLAIMS, LIABILITIES, COSTS, EXPENSES OR LOSSES IN ANY WAY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE
PERFORMANCE OR NONPERFORMANCE OF SERVICES HEREUNDER OR UNDER ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT FOR AN
AGGREGATE AMOUNT IN EXCESS OF THE FEES PAID BY THE LENDERS, THE SUPPLEMENTAL GUARANTORS AND THE
BOARD TO THE LOAN ADMINISTRATOR IN PERFORMING THE SERVICES DESCRIBED HEREIN.  NO TERMS OF THIS
AGREEMENT, OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT SHALL BENEFIT OR CREATE ANY RIGHT OR CAUSE OF ACTION IN
OR ON BEHALF OF ANY PERSON OR ENTITY OTHER THAN THE LENDERS, THE SUPPLEMENTAL GUARANTORS AND
THE BOARD.  THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SUBSECTION SHALL APPLY REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION,
DAMAGE, CLAIM, LIABILITY, COST, EXPENSE, OR LOSS, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STATUTE, TORT
(INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, NEGLIGENCE), OR OTHERWISE.

<b>SECTION 8.3</b>.      <u>INDEMNIFICATION</u>.

The Borrower and each Requesting Party (other than the Board) agrees to indemnify the Loan
Administrator and its directors, officers, employees, advisors, sub-servicer and representatives
from and against any and all costs, losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses (excluding
Taxes) which may be incurred by or asserted or awarded against the Loan Administrator in any way
relating to or arising out of the services provided by the Loan Administrator on behalf of and at
the request of such Requesting Party in connection with this Agreement or any action taken or omitted
by the Loan Administrator under this Agreement or any other Loan Document or both on behalf of and at
the request of such Requesting Party; <u>provided</u>, that neither the Borrower nor any Requesting
Party shall be liable for any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties,
actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from the Loan Administrator's
gross negligence or willful misconduct.  Without limitation of the foregoing, and to the extent that
the Loan Administrator is not reimbursed therefor by the Borrower under any Loan Document, any Requesting
Party requesting the Loan Administrator to take any action hereunder on its behalf agrees to
reimburse the Loan Administrator promptly upon demand (but in all events within 30 days after
written request) for any and all fees of the Loan Administrator, reasonable out-of-pocket costs
and expenses (including counsel fees) incurred by the Loan Administrator in connection with the
performance of the requested services requested by such Requesting Party hereunder and under
the Loan Documents.  Except as provided in the preceding sentence regarding reimbursement, in
no event shall the Board be obligated to indemnify the Loan Administrator or any of its
directors, officers, employees, advisors, representatives or any other party under any
circumstances.

<b>SECTION 8.4</b>.      <u>SUCCESSOR LOAN ADMINISTRATOR</u>.

The Loan Administrator may resign at any time by giving 30 days prior written notice thereof to the Agent,
the Lenders and the Board and may be removed at any time with or without cause by the Requisite Lenders
and the Board; <u>provided, however</u>, that the Loan Administrator shall continue to perform all Loan
Administrator functions hereunder until a successor Loan Administrator shall have been appointed.  Upon
any such resignation or removal, the Requisite Lenders shall have the right to appoint a successor Loan
Administrator, subject to confirmation by the Board and the approval (including in respect of fees payable
to the Loan Administrator), not to be unreasonably withheld, of the Borrower.  If no successor Loan
Administrator shall have accepted such appointment, or the parties are unable to agree on a
successor Loan Administrator, within 120 days after the retiring Loan Administrator's giving of
notice of resignation or the removal of the Loan Administrator, the Loan Administrator may
appoint a successor Loan Administrator who shall be willing to accept such appointment.  Upon
the acceptance of any appointment as Loan Administrator hereunder by a successor Loan
Administrator, such successor Loan Administrator shall thereupon succeed to and become vested
with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring or removed Loan
Administrator, and the retiring or removed Loan Administrator shall be discharged from its
duties and obligations as Loan Administrator under this Agreement.  After any Loan
Administrator's resignation or removal hereunder as Loan Administrator the provisions of this
ARTICLE VIII shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it
while it was Loan Administrator under this Agreement.

<b>SECTION 8.5.</b>      <u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST</u>.

(a)      The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that (i) in addition to serving as Loan
Administrator under this Agreement, the Loan Administrator may at any time and from time to
time service, manage or enter into other commercial arrangements with the Agent, any Lender,
the Board or any Supplemental Guarantor (each a "<u>Loan Administrator Relationship</u>"); (ii) in
the course of conducting such activities or the services to be provided by it hereunder, or both,
the Loan Administrator may from time to time have conflicts of interest by virtue of a Loan
Administrator Relationship; and (iii) the parties hereto expressly recognize that such
conflicts of interest may arise, do hereby waive such conflicts and agree that when such
conflicts of interest arise the Loan Administrator shall perform the services to be provided by
it hereunder in a professional, diligent and workmanlike fashion.  The parties hereto and the
Supplemental Guarantors further acknowledge and agree that the Loan Administrator, in its
capacity as Loan Administrator, is not acting as an Affiliate of any of the parties hereto, and
the performance of the Loan Administrator's obligations hereunder shall not affect any right or
remedy which the Agent, any Lender or any participant may have under any Loan Document, any
participation or the Board Guarantee.  Each Requesting Party expressly acknowledges and agrees
that at all times it shall take such action or omit to take such action hereunder based on its
own independent analysis of the relevant transaction and attendant facts and circumstances.
(b)      Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, if in connection with the provision
of services, a conflict of interest shall exist that, in the good faith opinion of the Loan Administrator,
requires an arm's-length negotiation between the Loan Administrator, on the one hand, and any
Person with a Loan Administrator Relationship, on the other hand, and the Loan Administrator
believes it would not be appropriate for the Loan Administrator to act on behalf of the
Requesting Party in connection with such matter, then the Loan Administrator shall withdraw
from acting as Loan Administrator in connection with the matter giving rise to such conflict of
interest by giving written notice to the Requesting Party not more than ten (10) Business Days
after it has made such determination.  In such event, the Requesting Party shall be entitled to
appoint an independent representative to act on its behalf and at its expense for purposes of
the matter giving rise to such conflict of interest, and the Loan Administrator shall have no
responsibility or liability to the Requesting Party with respect to such matter.  During the
period of such independent representative's appointment, the Loan Administrator shall continue
to perform its ordinary functions as Loan Administrator to the extent that the performance of
the Loan Administrator does not, in the reasonable opinion of the Requesting Party, directly or
indirectly affect the matter giving rise to the conflict of interest.

<b>SECTION 8.6</b>.     <u> REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND COVENANTS OF THE LOAN ADMINISTRATOR</u>.

The Loan Administrator hereby represents, warrants and covenants with the Lenders and the Board as follows:
(a)      it is duly incorporated and validly existing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation;
(b)      it has the corporate power and authority to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under this
Agreement, and this Agreement has been duly authorized by it by all necessary corporate action;
(c)      no authorization, consent or approval of any Governmental Authority, regulatory body or other Person is
required for the due authorization, execution, delivery or performance by it of this Agreement;
(d)      this Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by it and constitutes a legal and binding obligation
of it, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, except as enforceability may be
limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws
now or hereinafter in effect, relating to the enforcement of creditors' rights in general and
except as such enforceability may be limited by general principles of equity (whether
considered in a proceeding at law or in equity);
(e)      the execution, delivery and performance by it of this Agreement does not violate any provision of any
existing law or regulation or any material agreement to which it is subject or to which it is a
party or result in the creation of any Lien;
(f)      it has all corporate power and governmental licenses, authorizations, and consents and approvals
required to carry on its business as now conducted, except where the failure to have such
licenses, authorizations, and consents and approvals would not have a material adverse effect
on its ability to perform its duties under this Agreement; and
(g)      it will maintain and implement administrative and operating procedures, and keep and maintain all
documents, books, computer records and other information reasonably necessary or advisable for
the performance of the services to be provided by it hereunder.

                                              <b>ARTICLE IX

                                            THE FACILITY AGENTS</b>

<b>SECTION 9.1</b>.      <u>AUTHORIZATION AND ACTION</u>.

Each Lender and the Board hereby appoints and authorizes (i) WestLB AG to take such action as
administrative agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers under this Agreement, the Notes
and the other Loan Documents as are delegated by such Lender and the Board to it as Agent by
the terms hereof and thereof and (ii) Wells Fargo Bank Northwest, N.A. to take such action as
collateral agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers under the Security Agreement as are
delegated by such Lender and the Board to it as Collateral Agent by the terms hereof and thereof,
together, in each case, with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto (the Agent and the
Collateral Agent are referred to in this ARTICLE IX individually as a "<u>Facility Agent</u>" and collectively,
as the "<u>Facility Agents</u>"), and each Facility Agent hereby accepts such authorization and
appointment.  As to any matters not expressly provided for by this Agreement, the Notes, a Security
Agreement or any other Loan Document or provided for with specific reference to this SECTION 9.1
(including, without limitation, enforcement or collection of the Notes), neither Facility Agent
shall be required to exercise any discretion or take any action, but shall be required to act or to
refrain from acting (and shall be fully protected in so acting or refraining from action) upon the
instructions of the Board or, if the Board Guarantee is no longer in full force and effect, the
Requisite Lenders and such instructions shall be binding upon all Lenders; <u>provided, however</u>,
that neither Facility Agent shall be required to take any action which exposes such Facility
Agent to liability or which is contrary to this Agreement, the Board Guarantee, the Security
Documents, any Note or applicable law.  As to any provision of this Agreement, the Security
Agreement or any other Loan Document under which action may be taken or approval given by the
Requisite Lenders or the Board or both, as the case may be, the action taken or approval given
by the Requisite Lenders or the Board or both, as the case may be, shall be binding upon all
Lenders and Supplemental Guarantors to the same extent and with the same effect as if each
Lender and each Supplemental Guarantor had joined therein.  Each Facility Agent shall be
entitled to rely upon any note, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, teletype
message, facsimile transmission, statement, order, other document or other instrument or
writing believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed or sent by the proper
person or persons and, in respect of legal matters, upon the opinion of counsel selected by
such Facility Agent.  The Agent may deem and treat the payee of each Note as the owner thereof
for all purposes hereof unless and until a written notice of the assignment or transfer thereof
shall have been filed with the Agent.  Any request, authority or consent of any Person who at
the time of making such request or giving such authority or consent is the holder of a Note
shall be conclusive and binding on any subsequent holder, transferee or assignee of such Note.
Upon any delivery of any instructions to the Collateral Agent by the Requisite Lenders pursuant
to this Agreement, the Agent shall certify to the Collateral Agent that the Lenders delivering
such instructions constitute the Requisite Lenders under this Agreement.

<b>SECTION 9.2</b>.      <u>FACILITY AGENTS' RELIANCE, ETC</u>.

Neither Facility Agent nor any of its directors, officers, agents or employees shall be liable
to any Lender, any Supplemental Guarantor, the Loan Administrator or the Board for any action
taken or omitted to be taken by it or by such directors, officers, agents or employees under
or in connection with this Agreement, any Note or any other Loan Document, except for its or
their own gross negligence or willful misconduct as actually and finally determined by a final,
non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction and only to the extent of direct
(as opposed to special, indirect, consequential or punitive) damages.  Without limitation of the
generality of the foregoing, each Facility Agent:  (a) may consult with legal counsel, independent
public accountants and other experts selected by it and shall not be liable to any Lender, any
Supplemental Guarantor, the Loan Administrator or the Board for any action taken or omitted to
be taken in good faith by it in accordance with the advice of such experts; (b) makes no warranty
or representation to any Lender, any Supplemental Guarantor, the Loan Administrator or, except as
expressly provided in the Board Guarantee, the Board and shall not be responsible to any Lender,
any Supplemental Guarantor, the Loan Administrator or, except as expressly provided in the Board
Guarantee, the Board for any statements, warranties or representations (whether oral or written)
made in or in connection with this Agreement, any Note or any other Loan Document; (c) shall not
have any duty, and shall incur no liability for its failure, to ascertain or to inquire as to the
performance or observance of any of the terms, covenants or conditions of this Agreement, any
Note or any other Loan Document on the part of the Borrower or to inspect the property
(including the books and records) of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries; (d) shall not be
responsible to any Lender, any Supplemental Guarantor, the Loan Administrator or the Board for
the due execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of
this Agreement, any Note or any other Loan Document, or any other instrument or document
furnished pursuant thereto; (e) shall incur no liability under or in respect of this Agreement,
any Note or any other Loan Document by acting upon any note, notice, consent, certificate,
affidavit, letter, telegram, teletype message, facsimile transmission, statement, order or
other instrument or writing (which may be by telegram, facsimile transmission, cable or telex)
believed by it to be genuine and signed or sent by the proper party or parties; and (f) may
deem and treat each Lender which makes a loan hereunder as the holder of the indebtedness
resulting therefrom for all purposes hereof until the Agent receives and accepts an Assignment
and Acceptance Agreement entered into by such Lender, as assignor, and an eligible assignee as
provided in SECTION 10.2 hereof.

<b>SECTION 9.3</b>.      <u>FACILITY AGENTS AND AFFILIATES</u>.

If and so long as either Facility Agent shall remain a Lender, such Facility Agent shall have the
same rights and powers under this Agreement as any other Lender and may exercise the same rights
and powers under this Agreement as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were
not a Facility Agent; and the term "Lender" or "Lenders" shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated,
include such Facility Agent in its individual capacity.  Unrelated to its role as a Facility Agent
as set forth herein, each Facility Agent and its affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to,
act as trustee under indentures of, and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower
or its respective Subsidiaries and any Person who may do business with or own securities of the Borrower,
all as if it were not a Facility Agent hereunder and without any duty to account therefor to the
Lenders.

<b>SECTION 9.4</b>.      <u>REPRESENTATIONS OF CERTAIN PARTIES</u>.

Each Lender, each Supplemental Guarantor, the Loan Administrator and the Board's representatives
have actively engaged in the negotiation of all of the terms of this Agreement.  The Board's
representatives have met with the Borrower to discuss the business, affairs, financial condition
and prospects of the Borrower.  Neither Facility Agent has any duty or responsibility, either
initially or on a continuing basis, to provide any Lender, any Supplemental Guarantor, the Loan
Administrator or the Board with any credit or other information with respect to the Borrower
whether coming into its possession as of the date of this Agreement or at any time thereafter,
or to notify any Lender, any Supplemental Guarantor, the Loan Administrator or the Board of any
Event of Default except as provided in SECTION 9.5 hereof.  This Agreement and all instruments or
documents delivered in connection with this Agreement have been reviewed and approved by each Lender,
each Supplemental Guarantor, the Loan Administrator and the Board and none of the Lenders, the
Supplemental Guarantors, the Loan Administrator nor the Board have relied on any Facility Agent
as to any legal or factual matter in connection therewith or in connection with the
transactions contemplated thereunder.

<b>SECTION 9.5</b>.      <u>EVENTS OF DEFAULT; TERMINATION OF BOARD GUARANTEE</u>.

(a)      In the event of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default, any Lender, any
Supplemental Guarantor or the Board knowing of such event may (but shall have no duty to), or
the Borrower pursuant to SECTION 5.1(B)(V) hereof shall, give the Agent written notice specifying
such Event of Default or other event and expressly stating that such notice is a "notice of default".
The Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge of such events unless the Agent has received such
notice, or unless the Default or Event of Default consists of a failure of payment of principal
or interest on the Notes.  In the event that the Agent receives such a notice of the occurrence
of a Default or Event of Default, the Agent shall give written notice thereof to the Collateral
Agent, the Lenders, the Supplemental Guarantors, the Loan Administrator and the Board.  In the
event that such notice is a notice of an Event of Default or such notice of Default matures
into an Event of Default, each Facility Agent shall take such action with respect to such
Default or Event of Default as shall be reasonably directed in writing by the Board or, if the
Board Guarantee is no longer in full force and effect, the Requisite Lenders, subject to the
provisions of SECTION 9.6; <u>provided, however</u>, that, unless and until such Facility Agent shall
have received such directions, such Facility Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take
such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default or Event of
Default as it shall deem advisable and in the best interest of the Lenders and of the Board and
shall incur no liability for acting or refraining to act in such manner except for such
Facility Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct as actually and finally determined by a
court of competent jurisdiction and only to the extent of direct (as opposed to special,
indirect, consequential or punitive) damages.
(b)      In the event the Agent shall receive any notice from the Board to the effect that (i) the
Board has the right to terminate the Board Guarantee under Section 2.05 thereof, (ii) any portion
of the Board Guarantee has terminated under Section 2.04 thereof or otherwise, or (iii) the Board
Guarantee shall for any reason have ceased to be in full force and effect or the Board shall
have asserted that any of its obligations thereunder is invalid or unenforceable, the Agent
shall promptly give written notice thereof to the Collateral Agent and the Lenders.  The Agent
shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any such event unless the Agent has received such
notice (except if any such event results from the failure of the Agent to perform any of its
obligations under the Board Guarantee).

<b>SECTION 9.6</b>.      <u>FACILITY AGENTS' RIGHT TO INDEMNITY</u>.

Except for action expressly required of a Facility Agent hereunder without instructions from
any Person, each Facility Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any
action hereunder on behalf of any Lender or the Board unless it shall first be indemnified to
its satisfaction by such Person (or any affiliate thereof) or the Board, as the case may be,
against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or
continuing to take any such action.

<b>SECTION 9.7</b>.      <u>INDEMNIFICATION OF FACILITY AGENTS</u>.

The Lenders hereby agree to indemnify each Facility Agent and all affiliates, directors,
officers, employees, advisors and representatives thereof (to the extent not reimbursed
by the Borrower), ratably in accordance with the Obligations owed thereto as most recently
in effect prior to the date indemnification is sought, from and against any and all costs,
losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses which may be incurred by or asserted or awarded
against such Facility Agent in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the Notes
or the other Loan Documents or any action taken or omitted by such Facility Agent under this
Agreement, the Notes or the other Loan Documents; <u>provided</u>, that the Lenders shall not be liable
for any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments,
suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from any Facility Agent's gross negligence or
willful misconduct as actually and finally determined by a final, non-appealable judgment of a
court of competent jurisdiction and only to the extent of direct (as opposed to special, indirect,
consequential or punitive) damages.  Without limitation of the foregoing, each Lender agrees to
reimburse each Facility Agent promptly upon demand for its ratable share of any out-of-pocket expenses
(including counsel fees) incurred by such Facility Agent in connection with the administration,
or enforcement of, or the preservation of any rights under, this Agreement, the Notes or the
other Loan Documents, to the extent that such Facility Agent is not reimbursed for such
expenses by the Borrower.

<b>SECTION 9.8</b>.      <u>SUCCESSOR FACILITY AGENTS</u>.

(a)      Each Facility Agent may resign at any time by giving written notice thereof to the Lenders,
the Board and the Borrower and may be removed at any time with cause (or, following the Board's
honoring of a demand for payment in accordance with the Board Guarantee, without cause) by the Board.
Upon any such resignation or removal, the Borrower shall have the right with the prior written
consent of the Board and the Requisite Lenders to appoint a successor Facility Agent.  If no
successor Facility Agent shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring
Facility Agent's giving of notice of resignation or the Board's removal of such Facility Agent,
the Board and the Requisite Lenders shall have the right to appoint a successor Facility Agent
who shall be willing to accept such appointment.  In any event such successor Facility Agent
shall be a commercial bank organized or licensed under the laws of the United States of America
or of any State thereof and shall have a combined capital and surplus of at least
$500,000,000.  Upon the acceptance of any appointment as a Facility Agent hereunder by a
successor Facility Agent, such successor Facility Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become
vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring or removed Facility
Agent, and the retiring or removed Facility Agent shall be discharged from its duties and
obligations as agent under this Agreement or as collateral agent under the Security Agreement,
as the case may be.  After any Facility Agent's resignation or removal hereunder as a Facility
Agent the provisions of this ARTICLE IX shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or
omitted to be taken by it while it was a Facility Agent under this Agreement or the Security
Agreement, as the case may be.
(b)      Any corporation into which either Facility Agent may be merged or converted or with which
it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to
which either Facility Agent shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to the business of
either Facility Agent, provided that such corporation is a commercial bank organized or
licensed under the laws of the United States of America or any State thereof or under the laws
of any other jurisdiction (as long as such bank is licensed under any applicable U.S. or State
law to conduct business in the United States) and has a combined capital and surplus of at
least $500,000,000, shall be the successor of such Facility Agent hereunder without the
execution or filing of any paper with any party hereto or any further act on the part of any of
the parties hereto except where an instrument of transfer or assignment is required by law to
effect such succession.

<b>SECTION 9.9</b>.     <u> SPECIAL RULES GOVERNING TRANSACTION GUARANTEES</u>.

Anything in this Agreement to the contrary
notwithstanding, in respect of any action under (i) the Board Guarantee, (ii) (x) the
Supplemental Guarantee issued by the [***] Supplemental Guarantor and (y) the [***] Counter
Guarantee (the instruments in the preceding clauses (x) and (y) being herein collectively
called the "<u>[***] Instruments</u>") and (iii) the Supplemental Guarantee issued by the [***]
Supplemental Guarantor (and, collectively with the [***] Instruments and the Board Guarantee,
the "<u>Transaction Guarantees</u>"), including any demand for payment thereunder (a "<u>Transaction</u>
<u>Guarantee Demand</u>"), and any demand required to be made under this Agreement (a "<u>Past Due</u>
<u>Demand</u>") that is a precondition to making a Transaction Guarantee Demand under any such
Transaction Guarantee, the Agent shall be directed exclusively by Lenders, and take the
direction of Lenders, holding in excess of fifty percent (50%) of the principal amount of the
Loan subject to such Transaction Guarantee then outstanding.  In respect of any action to be
taken under the [***] Letter Agreement, the Agent shall be directed exclusively by Lenders, and
take the direction of Lenders, holding in excess of fifty (50%) of the principal amount of
Tranche B-1 of the Loan.  In respect of any such action, the Agent shall be entitled to the
indemnities provided under Sections 9.6 and 9.7 hereof, but only from the Lenders entitled to
give the direction in respect of such action.  The Agent agrees to make a Past Due Demand
hereunder and a Transaction Guarantee Demand under a Transaction Guarantee if it is directed to
do so by the requisite Lenders and is entitled to do so hereunder and under such Transaction
Guarantee, as the case may be.  The Agent further agrees that if it shall be directed to make
(i) a Past Due Demand in respect of any amounts not paid hereunder when due or (ii) a
Transaction Guarantee Demand under any Transaction Guarantee, in either case, from the
Lender(s) entitled to direct the same (and the Agent is in fact entitled to make such a demand
hereunder and under such Transaction Guarantee), it shall, whether or not it receives a
direction to make  Past Due Demand from the other Lenders (or the Board) in respect of other
amounts past due or a Transaction Guarantee Demand in respect of any other Transaction
Guarantee, make a contemporaneous Past Due Demand hereunder in respect of all then past due
amounts hereunder or a Transaction Guarantee Demand under each Transaction Guarantee (to the
extent any Past Due Demand required thereunder has been made and it is otherwise entitled to do
so thereunder), as the case may be.

<b>SECTION 10.1</b>.     <u>AMENDMENTS, WAIVERS, ETC</u>.

(a)      No amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan
Document nor consent to any departure by the Borrower therefrom shall in any event be effective
unless the same shall be in writing and, with respect to any such amendment or modification, signed
by the Borrower, and with respect to any such amendment, modification, waiver or consent (x) so long
as the Board Guarantee is in full force and effect, signed by the Board or (y) if the Board
Guarantee is no longer in effect, signed by the Requisite Lenders, and then any such waiver or

take such action, affect the rights or duties of either Facility Agent under this Agreement,
the other Loan Documents, any Supplemental Guarantee or the Board Guarantee; and (B) no
amendment, modification, waiver or consent of or in respect of the Board Guarantee, any

(b)      The Agent may, but shall have no obligation to, with the written concurrence of any Lender,
execute amendments, modifications, waivers or consents on behalf of that Lender.  Any waiver or consent
shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which it was
given.  No notice to or demand on the Borrower in any case shall entitle the Borrower to any
other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances.
(c)      Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the event that the Borrower shall have
requested each of the Lenders and Supplemental Guarantors, in writing, to agree to an amendment,
modification, waiver or consent with respect to any particular provision or provisions hereof,
and any such Lender or Supplemental Guarantor shall have failed to state, in writing, that it
either agrees or disagrees (in full or in part) with such request (in the case of its statement
of agreement, subject to satisfactory documentation and such other conditions it may specify)

discretion, to such requests on behalf of such Lender or Supplemental Guarantor as such
Lender's or Supplemental Guarantor's attorney-in-fact and to execute and deliver any writing
approved by the Agent which evidences such agreement as such Lender's or Supplemental
Guarantor's duly authorized agent for such purposes.
(d)      In connection with any proposed amendment, modification, waiver or termination (a "<u>Proposed
Change</u>") requiring the consent of all affected Lenders, if the consent of the Requisite Lenders is
obtained, but the consent of other Lenders whose consent is required is not obtained (any such
Lender whose consent is not obtained as described in this SECTION 10.1 being referred to as a
"<u>Non-Consenting Lender</u>"), then, so long as the Lender that is acting as the Agent is not a
Non-Consenting Lender, at the Borrower's request, the Agent or an Eligible Lender that is
acceptable to the Agent and the Board shall have the right with the Agent's consent and in the
Agent's sole discretion (but shall have no obligation) to purchase from such Non-Consenting
Lender, and such Non-Consenting Lender agrees that it shall, upon the Agent's request, sell and
assign to the Lender that is acting as the Agent or such Eligible Lender, all of the portion of
the Loan of such Non-Consenting Lender for an amount equal to the principal balance of such
portion of the Loan held by the Non-Consenting Lender and all accrued interest and fees with
respect thereto through the date of sale, such purchase and sale to be consummated pursuant to
an executed Assignment and Acceptance.

<b>SECTION 10.2</b>.     <u>ASSIGNMENTS AND PARTICIPATIONS</u>.

(a)      Each Lender may sell, transfer, negotiate or assign either in whole or in part to one or
more Eligible Lenders its rights and obligations hereunder and under the Notes and the other Loan
Documents without the prior consent of the Borrower but, except as otherwise provided in SECTION 10.2(D),
with the consent, not to be unreasonably withheld, of the Agent, and the prior written approval
of the Board (such consent, in the case of an assignment to an Affiliate of any Lender that is
an Eligible Lender, not to be unreasonably withheld); <u>provided</u>, that (i) the assigning Lender
shall give prompt written notice to the Agent and the Board of the terms of and the parties to
any such assignment, (ii) the proposed assignee shall provide to the Agent and the Board all
documentation and certificates as required by the Agent and the Board to confirm to the Agent's
and the Board's satisfaction that such proposed assignee is an Eligible Lender, and (iii) the
Borrower will not be obligated to pay any greater amount under SECTION 2.10(C), SECTION 2.11 or
SECTION 2.12(A), (c), or (d) (in respect of increased costs, amounts in respect of capital
adequacy or Taxes imposed pursuant to applicable law in effect on the date of such assignment)
to the assignee than the Borrower is then obligated to pay to the assigning Lender under such
Sections; <u>provided, however</u>, that the consent of the Board shall not be required for any
assignment which occurs after the Board has been reimbursed in full for all payments under the
Board Guarantee or the Board Guarantee shall have terminated.
(b)      The parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Agent, for its acceptance
and recording, an Assignment and Acceptance, and the assignee, if a Non-U.S. Person, shall deliver
to the Borrower, the Agent and each Supplemental Guarantor, as applicable, on or prior to the date
of the assignment, two completed copies of either IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI or other applicable
form, certificate or document required to satisfy the requirements of SECTION 2.12.  Upon such
execution, delivery and acceptance and the receipt by the Agent of an assignment fee in the
amount of $5,000, the Agent shall record such Assignment and Acceptance and from and after the
effective date specified in such Assignment and Acceptance (i) the assignee thereunder of all
or any portion of the Loan shall become a party hereto and, to the extent that rights and
obligations under the Loan Documents have been assigned to such assignee pursuant to such
Assignment and Acceptance, have the rights and obligations of a Lender and (ii) the assignor
thereunder shall, to the extent that rights and obligations under this Agreement have been
assigned by it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance, relinquish its rights (except those
which survive the payment in full of the Obligations) and be released from its obligations
under the Loan Documents, other than those relating to events or circumstances occurring prior
to such assignment (and, in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering all or the
remaining portion of an assigning Lender's rights and obligations under the Loan Documents,
such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto).
(c)      Upon its receipt of an Assignment and Acceptance executed by an assigning Lender and
an assignee, the Agent shall, if such Assignment and Acceptance has been completed, (i) accept
such Assignment and Acceptance, (ii) record the information contained therein in the Register,
(iii) give prompt notice thereof to the Borrower and (iv) give prompt written notice of the terms
of and parties to any such assignment to the Board.
(d)      In addition to the other assignment rights provided in this SECTION 10.2, each Lender may
assign, without the prior consent of the Borrower, the Agent or the Board, as collateral or otherwise,
any of its rights under this Agreement to any Federal Reserve Bank pursuant to Regulation A of
the Federal Reserve Board, provided, however, that no such assignment shall release the
assigning Lender from any of its obligations hereunder.
(e)      Each Lender may, without the prior consent of the Borrower or any other Person, sell
participations, to the extent permitted by the Regulations and except as provided in Section 5.4(b)
of the Board Guarantee, in or to all or a portion of its rights and obligations hereunder and under
any Note and the other Loan Documents; <u>provided</u>, that (i) neither any Note nor the Board
Guarantee is assigned, conveyed, sold or transferred in whole or in part in connection with any
participation, (ii) the Board's ability to assert any and all defenses available to it under
the Board Guarantee and the law is not adversely affected, (iii)  subject to the final sentence
of this SECTION 10.2 the Borrower will not be obligated to pay any greater amount under SECTION
2.10(C), 2.11 or SECTION 2.12(A), (c) or (d) to such participant than the Borrower would then
obligated to pay to any selling Lender under such Sections had such participation not been
sold, and (iv) the initial Lenders shall maintain and shall not sell any participation in
Tranche C of the Loan.  In the event of the sale of any participation by any Lender, except as
otherwise expressly provided herein, (A) such Lender's obligations under the Loan Documents
shall remain unchanged, (B) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties
for the performance of such obligations, (C) such Lender shall remain the holder of such
Obligations for all purposes of this Agreement and (D) the Agent, the Board and the other
Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such
Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement.  Any holder of such a participation will
be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.10(c), 2.11 and 2.12 to the same extent as if such
Person were a Lender (but subject to the restrictions of SECTION 2.12(J)); <u>provided that</u>, no
such holder shall be entitled to any such benefits (x) unless such holder shall have agreed in
writing for the benefit of the Borrower to be bound by the provisions of Section 2.10(c), 2.11
and 2.12 applicable to a Lender claiming amounts under such Sections or (y) to the extent the
Borrower would not have had to have paid thereunder had such participation not been sold.
(f)      The Company shall not be responsible for the costs incurred by any Lender in connection
with assigning or granting a participation in any Note held by such Lender.

<b>SECTION 10.3</b>.     <u>COSTS AND EXPENSES</u>.

preparation, execution and delivery of the Loan Documents, the Board Guarantee, the
Supplemental Guarantees and all documents relating thereto (including, without limitation,
reasonable legal fees and expenses), (ii) all costs and expenses incurred by the Loan
Administrator, the Lenders, the Supplemental Guarantors, the Board, the Collateral Agent and
the Agent in connection with any consents, amendments, waivers or other modifications hereto or
thereto (including, without limitation, reasonable legal fees and expenses), except, as to any
party, to the extent any of the foregoing are requested by such party other than the Borrower
and (iii) all costs and expenses, including, without limitation, legal fees and expenses
incurred by the Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Lenders, the Board, the Loan Administrator and
each Supplemental Guarantor in enforcing any Obligations of, or in collecting any payments due
from, the Borrower hereunder or under the other Loan Documents (including without limitation
any costs and expenses contemplated under the Security Agreement) or in connection with the
administration, or enforcement of, or the preservation of any rights under any Loan Document.
(b)      Each Lender agrees to pay promptly all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the
Agent, the Board and each Supplemental Guarantor in connection with the procurement of any
requisite approval required therefrom in respect of any assignment or participation of the Loan

<b>SECTION 10.4</b>.     <u>INDEMNITIES</u>.

Whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby shall be consummated, the
Borrower agrees to defend, indemnify, pay and hold harmless the Board, the Agent, the
Collateral Agent, the Lenders, the Supplemental Guarantors, the [***] Counter Guarantor, the
Loan Administrator and their respective Affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents and
advisors (collectively called the "<u>Indemnitees</u>") on an after-tax basis from and against any and
all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, claims,
costs, expenses and disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever (including without
limitation the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel for such Indemnitees, but excluding
Taxes), whether direct, indirect or consequential or special or punitive, and whether based on
any federal, state or foreign laws, statutes, rules or regulations (including without
limitation securities and commercial laws, statutes and rules or regulations), on common law or
equitable cause or on contract or otherwise, that may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted
against any such Indemnitee, in any manner arising out of this Agreement, the other Loan
Documents, the Supplemental Guarantees or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby
(including, without limitation, the use or intended use of the proceeds of the Loan) or any
statement contained in the Application or otherwise made by or on behalf of the Borrower to the
Board or any breach or default by the Borrower of any provision of the Loan Documents
(collectively called the "<u>Indemnified Liabilities</u>"); <u>provided</u>, that the Borrower shall not have
any obligation to any Indemnitee hereunder with respect to any Indemnified Liabilities to the
extent such Indemnified Liabilities (i) arise from the gross negligence or willful misconduct
of such Indemnitee (as actually and finally determined by a final, non-appealable judgment of a
court of competent jurisdiction), (ii) constitute ordinary and usual operating or overhead
expenses of such Indemnitee or (iii) relate to amounts which any other Person has agreed to
pay).  To the extent that the undertaking to defend, indemnify, pay and hold harmless set forth
in the preceding sentence may be unenforceable because it is violative of any law or public
policy, the Borrower shall contribute the maximum portion that they are permitted to pay and
satisfy under applicable law to the payment and satisfaction of all Indemnified Liabilities
incurred by the Indemnitees or any of them.  In no event, however, shall any Indemnitee be
liable on any theory of liability for any special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages
(including, without limitation, any loss of profits, business or anticipated savings).

<b>SECTION 10.5</b>.     <u>RIGHT OF SET-OFF</u>.

In addition to any rights now or hereafter granted under applicable law and not by way of
limitation of any such rights, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event
of Default, to the fullest extent permitted by law, each Lender is hereby authorized by the
Borrower at any time or from time to time, without notice to the Borrower or to any other
Person, any such notice being hereby expressly waived, to set off and to appropriate and
to apply any and all deposits (general or special, including, but not limited to, Indebtedness
evidenced by certificates of deposit, whether matured or unmatured) and any other Indebtedness
at any time held or owing by that Lender to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower
against and on account of the obligations and liabilities of the Borrower to that Lender under
this Agreement, the Notes, and the other Loan Documents, including, but not limited to, all
claims of any nature or description arising out of or connected with this Agreement, the Notes,
or any other Loan Document, irrespective of whether or not (i) that Lender shall have made any
demand hereunder or (ii) the principal of or the interest on the Loan or any other amounts due
hereunder shall have become due and payable pursuant to SECTION 7.2 and although said
obligations and liabilities, or any of them, may be contingent or unmatured.

<b>SECTION 10.6</b>.     <u>SHARING OF PAYMENTS, ETC</u>.

Each of the Lenders and the Board hereby agree among themselves that if any of them shall,
whether by voluntary payment, by realization upon security, through the exercise of and
right of set-off or banker's lien, by counterclaim or cross action or by the enforcement
of any right under the Loan Documents or otherwise, or as adequate protection of a deposit
treated as cash collateral under the Bankruptcy Code, receive payment or reduction of a
proportion of the aggregate amount of principal, interest, fees and other amounts then due and
owing to the Lenders and the Board hereunder or under the other Loan Documents (collectively,
the "<u>Aggregate Amounts Due</u>") which is greater than the proportion received by any other Lender
or the Board in respect of the Aggregate Amounts Due to such other Lender or the Board, then
the Lender or the Board receiving such proportionately greater payment shall (i) notify the
Agent and each other Lender and the Board of the receipt of such payment, and (ii) (A) in the
case of a Lender, (1) apply a portion of such payment to purchase participations equal to the
portion of the Aggregate Amounts Due to the other Lenders and (2) pay to the Board the portion
of the Aggregate Amounts Due to it, or (B) in the case of the Board, pay to each Lender the
portion of the Aggregate Amounts Due to it (which participations shall be deemed to have been
purchased and payments made simultaneously upon the receipt by the seller or the Board of its
portion of such payment, and which participations will be permitted notwithstanding any
prohibition to the contrary in Section 10.2(e)) so that all such recoveries of Aggregate
Amounts Due shall be shared by all Lenders and the Board in proportion to the Aggregate Amounts
Due to them; <u>provided</u>, that if all or part of such proportionately greater payment received by
such purchasing Lender or the Board is thereafter recovered from such Lender or the Board upon
the bankruptcy or reorganization of the Borrower or otherwise, those purchases or other
payments shall be rescinded and the purchase prices paid for such participations or other
payments shall be returned to such purchasing Lender or the Board ratably to the extent of such
recovery, but without interest.  The Borrower expressly consents to the foregoing arrangement
and agrees that any holder of a participation so purchased may exercise any and all rights of
banker's lien, set-off or counterclaim with respect to any and all monies owing by the Borrower
to that holder with respect thereto as fully as if that holder were owed the amount of the
participation held by that holder.

<b>SECTION 10.8</b>.     <u>NO WAIVER; REMEDIES</u>.

No failure on the part of the Board, any Lender, the Collateral Agent or the Agent to exercise,
and no delay in exercising, any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall

or the exercise of any other right.  The remedies herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive
of any remedies provided by law.

<b>SECTION 10.9</b>.     <u>INDEPENDENCE OF REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND COVENANTS</u>.

<b>SECTION 10.19</b>.    <u>ACKNOWLEDGEMENT REGARDING FEDERAL AUTHORITY</u>.

(a)      Each of the parties hereto and each of the Supplemental Guarantors acknowledges and agrees that:
                  (i)    the operations and assets of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries (including, without
                  limitation, Aircraft Related Equipment and other assets that constitute Collateral) are
                  subject, directly and indirectly, to the actions, inaction and policies of various
                  Governmental Authorities, including, in particular but without limitation, the United
                  States Department of Transportation (of which the Federal Aviation Administration is a
                  component) and the United States Department of Justice;
                 (ii)    Governmental Authorities, in discharging their current and future statutory or
                  regulatory responsibilities, may act, decline to act, or adopt policies resulting in
                  material adverse effects on (A) the business, condition (financial or otherwise),
                  operations, performance, prospects, assets or properties of the Borrower and its
                  Subsidiaries, (B) the ability of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries to perform their
                  payment or other material obligations under the Loan Documents, and (C) the value of
                  the Collateral or the practical ability of the Collateral Agent to realize such value
                  in the event of a Default or an Event of Default;
                (iii)    no Governmental Authority, in discharging its statutory or regulatory
                  responsibilities, has or shall have any obligation whatsoever to the Borrower or any
                  of its Subsidiaries, or to any secured party by reason of such Governmental Authority's
                  representation on the Board, the Board's issuance of the Board Guarantee, or the Board's
                  participation as a party to the other Loan Documents, to consider the potential that
                  any of the material adverse effects referred to in clause (ii) above may result from
                  such Governmental Authority's discharge of its statutory or regulatory responsibilities;
                  and
                  iv)    neither the Board, in discharging its rights and responsibilities, or in exercising
                  its discretion, under the Act, the Regulations, the Board Guarantee or the other Loan
                  Documents, nor any of the Board's members, acting in their capacities as such, has or
                  shall have any obligation whatsoever to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or to
                  any of the secured parties to take any action in connection with a Governmental Authority's
                  discharge of its statutory or regulatory responsibilities which may have any of the
                  material adverse effects referred to in clause (ii) above, and the Board may not take
                  any action depriving a Governmental Authority of its rights and powers to discharge
                  its statutory and regulatory responsibilities in any manner that may have any of the
                  material adverse effects referred to in clause (ii) above.
(b)      Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the parties and the Supplemental Guarantors
acknowledge and agree that (i) the Department of Transportation, through the Federal Aviation
Administration, has broad authority under Title 49 of the United States Code to regulate the
use of the navigable airspace of the United States so as to ensure its safe and efficient
utilization, (ii) the exercise of such authority may substantially impair or eliminate
altogether the utility to the Borrower and its Subsidiaries and value to the secured parties of
Aircraft Related Equipment pledged as Collateral and other assets of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries such as gates and slots utilized at airports, and (iii) no assurance, express or
implied, has been given by any Governmental Authority, including the Board, to the Borrower or
to any secured party, nor has either of the Borrower or any secured party relied upon any such
assurance, with respect to any future action, inaction or policy of the Federal Aviation
Administration or any other Governmental Authority relating to any such Collateral or other
assets.
(c)      Nothing in this SECTION 10.19 shall be construed to limit or otherwise affect the Board's obligations
under the Board Guarantee.

<b>SECTION 10.20</b>.    <u>CUMULATIVE RIGHTS AND REMEDIES</u>.

The rights and remedies conferred upon the parties hereto shall be cumulative, and the exercise or waiver
of any such right or remedy shall not preclude or inhibit the exercise of any additional rights or remedies.
The waiver of any right or remedy hereunder shall not preclude the subsequent exercise of such right or remedy.
