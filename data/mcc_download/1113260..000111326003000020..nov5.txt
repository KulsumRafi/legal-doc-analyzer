November 29, 2002


                 THIRD QUARTER FINANCIAL RESULTS


Radius Explorations is pleased to report on its third quarter
financial results.

The Company reported a net loss for the nine months ended
September 30, 2002 of $379,119, compared to $683,195 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2001.  Major items comprising this
year's administrative expenses are $147,283 for salaries
($249,248 in 2001), $61,953 for public relations ($277,952 in
2001), and $45,000 for consulting fees ($69,333 in 2001).  Total
expenses are significantly lower for the nine months ended
September 30, 2002 compared to the equivalent period in 2001 due
to management's cost-reducing efforts.

Approximately $1,227,500 was spent on the Company's mineral
properties in Guatemala during the nine months ended September
30, 2002, most of which on projects owned 100% by the Company.
$593,000 of that amount was spent on the Holly Project.

As at September 30, 2002, Radius had working capital of
approximately $984,400, compared to working of $2.7 million as at
the fiscal year ended December 31, 2001.  In November, the
Company announced a proposed private placement of 4,000,000 units
at $0.20 per unit, to raise $800,000 in additional working
capital for the Company.  This financing is subject to acceptance
by the TSX Venture Exchange.

Management expects that the Company has sufficient working
capital to meet its corporate and exploration commitments over
the next 12 months.
