criteria.</font></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scope.</font></b>&nbsp; Initially, THP will conduct further genetic
engineering and related work using its technology and expertise in an effort to achieve the F2A+ Milestone as soon as practicable.&nbsp; Prior to achieving the F2A+ Milestone, THP may prepare certain transgenic rabbits that, while not fully meeting the criteria to
qualify as a F2A Animal, are nonetheless useful for research purposes under the hTG Program.&nbsp; SMC will test those animals as requested by THP and will provide THP the results of any testing to further THP&#146;s efforts to create useful transgenic rabbits and
achieve the F2A+ Milestone.&nbsp; The Parties will reasonably cooperate in all efforts of THP to reach the F2A+ Milestone.&nbsp; Promptly after THP has produced the transgenic animals pursuant to the F2A+ Milestone, SMC will undertake efforts to further evaluate such
F2A Animals to determine whether it will exercise the hTG Commercial Option and THP will supply SMC with initial breeding pairs of such THP Animals as are reasonably needed for SMC&#146;s activities under the hTG Program. During the term of this hTG Collaboration
Agreement, THP will supply to SMC, from time to time, any THP Animals that are improvements over previously supplied F2A Animals in accordance with Section 4.6 hereto.&nbsp; THP will supply to SMC sufficient quantities of improvement THP Animals so that SMC, at its
own expense, can establish a breeding colony of these THP Animals for use in the hTG Program.&nbsp; If SMC elects not to exercise the hTG Commercial Option before the end of the hTG Commercial Option Period, SMC will return all THP Animals and THP Know-How in its
possession under this Agreement to THP, unless the Hematology Alliance Agreement or a Hematology Commercial License Agreement is still in effect, in which case the THP Animals and THP Know-How will be covered by such Hematology Alliance Agreement or Hematology
Commercial License Agreement(s).&nbsp; The majority of the research and development efforts conducted after achievement of the F2A+ Milestone, including the development of hTG Antibody Products, will be conducted and directed by SMC with collaborative efforts from
THP.&nbsp; The goal of these efforts is, if the hTG Antibody Products have the appropriate technical characteristics, to seek to obtain the requisite Regulatory Approvals for at least one (1) hTG Antibody Product in an expeditious manner.&nbsp; The Parties will
manage the hTG Program through a committee (the &#147;<b>Steering Committee</b>&#148;) as discussed below.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></b> Formation and Composition of the Steering Committee.&nbsp;
Promptly after the Effective Date, the Parties will form a Steering Committee by each Party designating an equal number of its employees (minimum of two (2) and a maximum of three (3) unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Parties) as its representatives on the
Steering Committee.&nbsp; The Parties will endeavor to designate employees with the appropriate skills and experience necessary to perform the tasks and supervisory functions of the Steering Committee, and with seniority sufficient to facilitate decision-making on
behalf of the Parties with respect to the hTG Program.&nbsp; An alternate representative designated by a Party may serve temporarily in the absence of one of that Party&#146;s designated representatives, and a Party may replace any of its representatives on the
Steering Committee in the designating Party&#146;s discretion.&nbsp; Each Party will designate one of its representatives on the Steering Committee as a &#147;<b>Project Liaison</b>.&#148; Each Project Liaison will serve as the liaison between the Parties and the
Steering Committee, and such liaison function will include the reporting of the respective progress of each Party under the hTG Program.&nbsp; A Project Liaison may also serve as an Alliance Liaison under the Hematology Alliance Agreement.</font></p>
