         6.1      INTEREST EQUIVALENT FACTORS.

(a)   IN GENERAL. From time to time the Committee shall determine annual
      interest equivalent factors that apply to Deferrals made in each calendar
      year. The Committee may determine different interest equivalent factors
      for Deferrals made in different calendar years, and except as otherwise
      provided herein, the Committee may change each year the interest
      equivalent factor applicable to Deferrals made in a specified calendar
      year.

(b)   PRE-1998 DEFERRALS. Except as otherwise provided in Sections 6.2 and 6.3,
      the annual interest equivalent factor for Vested Participants for pre-1998
      Deferrals shall be 12 percent; provided that, unless the Committee decides
      otherwise, the annual interest equivalent factor for pre-1998 Deferrals
      for Participants who are Vested pursuant to Section 8.5(c) shall be 8%
      beginning at termination of employment.

(c)   1998 AND LATER DEFERRALS. Except as otherwise provided with respect to a
      Change in Control, the annual interest equivalent factors for Deferrals
      after 1997 may be changed from time to time by the Committee.

(d)   AFTER DEATH. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the annual interest equivalent
      factors applicable to a Participant's Deferrals (i) at the time of the
      Participant's death shall continue to apply until the Participant's
      Account is entirely distributed and (ii) shall be consistent with any
      severance or other agreement between the Company and the Participant.
