                                                              EXHIBIT 10.2(6)(b)

                                SECOND AMENDMENT
                                       TO
                      BELO 2000 EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PLAN


         Belo Corp., a Delaware corporation, pursuant to authorization by the
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, adopts the following
amendments to its 2000 Executive Compensation Plan (the "Plan").

         1. Paragraph 2(l) of the Plan ("Management Objectives") is amended by
the addition of the following paragraph:

                  In addition, the Committee may, in its discretion, establish
         other measurable performance objectives, in lieu of or in addition to
         the performance objectives set forth above, in connection with any
         Award granted to a Participant, provided, however, that if the
         Participant to whom such other performance objectives would apply is a
         covered employee within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code at
         the time the Award is granted or is likely to become a covered employee
         at any time during the Performance Period, the Committee determines
         that the application of such other performance objectives would not
         result in the loss of the otherwise available exemption of the Award
         under Section 162(m) of the Code.

         2. The phrase "the earliest age that qualifies as Early Retirement Age
under The G. B. Dealey Retirement Pension Plan, as amended from time to time,"
is amended in each place it appears in the Plan to read "at least age 55 and
completing at least three years of service (computed in the same manner as years
of service are computed under the Belo Savings Plan),".

         3. Appendix A to the Plan ("Termination Guidelines") is amended in its
entirety to read as set forth on Schedule 1 to this Amendment.

         4. References in the Plan to "the Company" are amended to refer to
"Belo".

         5. The foregoing amendments will be effective with respect to Awards
made on and after the date of this Amendment.

         Executed at Dallas, Texas, this 5th day of December, 2002.

                                       BELO CORP.
