         NOW, THEREFORE, THE PARTIES HEREBY AGREE AS FOLLOWS:

1.       Amendment of the Notice. The section of the Notice entitled "Vesting
Schedule" shall be deleted and replaced in its entirety by the following:

         The shares granted vest in two installments, with the vesting on each
         installment vesting date subject to your continuous provision of
         service to the Company from the Vesting Commencement Date until the
         respective installment vesting date, as follows: the first installment
         of 79% of the total number of shares granted vests on February 10,
         2003, and the second installment of the remainder of the total number
         of shares granted vests on July 10, 2003.

2.       Amendment of the Stock Agreement. The current section entitled
"Vesting" of the Stock Agreement shall be deleted and replaced in its entirety
by the following:

         The shares vest in two installments, as set forth in the Notice of
         Restricted Stock Award, as amended by Section 1 of this Amendment.
         Notwithstanding the foregoing:

         (a) If you are subject to an Employment Termination that occurs (i)
         prior to a Change in Control (as defined in the Plan) and (ii)
         following July 1, 2002 and before February 10, 2003, then you will

         Commencement Date until the date of such Employment Termination;

         (b) If you are subject to an Employment Termination that occurs (i)

<PAGE>

         month of service provided to the Company from February 10, 2003 until
         the date of such Employment Termination;

         (c) If you are subject to an Employment Termination within the first 12
         months after a Change in Control and before February 10, 2003, then you
         will receive vesting credit in the amount of 1/24 of the total shares
         for each full month of service provided to the Company from the Vesting
         Commencement Date until the Employment Termination, and you will become
         vested in an additional number of shares, as if you provided 12
         additional months of service with the Company following the Employment
         Termination; or

         (d) If you are subject to an Employment Termination within the first 12
         months after a Change in Control and on or following February 10, 2003,
         then any Restricted Shares (as defined below) will accelerate and
         become fully vested. You will only receive the vesting acceleration set
         forth in this paragraph if you execute a general release (in a form
         prescribed by the Company) and return all Company property.

         No additional shares vest after your service as an employee, consultant
         or director of the Company or a subsidiary of the Company has
         terminated for any reason.

     (a) Section 2(c) of the Incentive Agreement shall be deleted and replaced

         Restricted Stock Agreement dated _________, 200__:

         (i) If the Employee experiences an Employment Termination that occurs

         full month of service provided to the Company from February 10, 2003
         until the date of such Employment Termination;

         (iii) If the Employee experiences an Employment Termination within the

         then Employee will receive vesting credit in the amount of 1/24 of the
         Restricted Stock Grant for each full month of service provided to the
         Company from the Vesting Commencement Date until the Employment
         Termination, and Employee will become vested in an additional number of
         shares subject to the Restricted Stock Grant, as if Employee provided
         12 additional months of service with the Company following the
         Employment Termination; or

         (iv) If the Employee experiences an Employment Termination within the
         first 12 months after a Change in Control and on or following February
         10, 2003, then any remaining unvested shares subject to the Restricted
         Stock Grant will accelerate and become fully vested. The Employee will
         only receive the vesting acceleration set forth in this Section 3(b) if
         the Employee executes a general release (in a form prescribed by the
         Company) and returns all Company property.
