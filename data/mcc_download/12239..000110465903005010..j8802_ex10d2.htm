Breach</u>. It is recognized that damages

in the event of breach of paragraphs 4.1 or 4.2 by the Employee would be

difficult, if not impossible, to ascertain, and it is therefore agreed that the

Corporation, in addition to and without limiting any other remedy or right they

may have, shall terminate SERP payments as provided under this Agreement in the

event of breach of paragraphs 4.1 or 4.2. Prior to the termination of SERP

payments, however, the Corporation shall provide summary notice to the Employee

of such action, by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested,

addressed to the Employee at her then principal residence</font></p>
