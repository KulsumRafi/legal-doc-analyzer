of Stock which are being purchased pursuant to the exercise, so that the net proceeds of the sale transaction will at least equal the amount of the aggregate purchase price of such shares plus any
amounts required to be withheld, and pursuant to which the broker undertakes to deliver to the Company such amount not later than the date on which the sale transaction will settle in the ordinary
