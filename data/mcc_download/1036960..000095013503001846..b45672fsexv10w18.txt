EMPLOYMENT        be able to exercise your option, except as follows:

                  Retirement, permanent disability or death. If your employment
                  terminates because of your retirement, permanent disability or
                  death, you (or your estate) will have five years from your
                  termination date to exercise your option, unless the option
                  term ends earlier, in which case you (or your estate) will
                  have until the end of the term to exercise. RETIREMENT means
                  permanently terminating your employment, with no intention of
                  engaging in a full-time job, after reaching age 65, or after
                  reaching age 55 if your age plus your years of service equals
                  65 or more. This definition of retirement is used only for
                  purposes of this agreement.

                  All other cases. If your employment terminates because you
                  quit, or for any other reason other than retirement, permanent
                  disability or death, you (or your estate, if you die within
                  the period) will have 90 days from your termination date to
                  exercise your option, unless the option term ends earlier, in
                  which case you (or your estate) will have until the end of the
                  term to exercise.

                  Regardless of the cause of your termination, you (or your
                  estate) can exercise your option only to the extent it is
                  vested on your termination date.

TRANSFERABILITY   Your option is not transferable except by will or the laws of
                  descent and distribution. During your lifetime only you can
                  exercise your option. This option shall not be subject to
                  attachment or similar process. Any attempted sale, pledge,
                  assignment, transfer or other disposition of your option
                  contrary to the provisions of this agreement, or the levy of
                  any attachment or similar process upon your option, shall be
                  null and void without effect.

MISCELLANEOUS     Nothing in this agreement gives you the right to remain
                  employed by the Company or any subsidiary. This agreement
                  shall be governed by the laws of the State of Maine, without
                  regard to conflicts of law principles. The section and
                  paragraph headings in this agreement are for convenience of
                  reference only and shall not affect the construction or
                  interpretation of this agreement.

                  the Company below indicate your and the Company's agreement to
