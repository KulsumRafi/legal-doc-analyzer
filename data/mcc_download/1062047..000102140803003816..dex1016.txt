                                   ARTICLE III

                           CONTRIBUTIONS AND PAYMENTS

     SECTION 3.1 Procedure for Holder Advances; Certificates.

          (a) Upon receipt from Lessee by the Agent of a Requisition, and
     subject to the terms and conditions of the Participation Agreement, the
     Agent shall request from each Holder its pro rata share of any Advance and
     each Holder shall make its own pro rata share of any Advance under the
     Holder Commitment of such Holder, as set forth on Schedule 1 hereto, on
     each date Advances are made pursuant to Section 5 of the Participation
     Agreement. The Agent may request an Advance under the Holder Commitments
     during the Commitment Period on any date that an Advance may be requested
     pursuant to the terms of Section 5.2(a) of the Participation Agreement,
     provided, that the Agent shall give each Holder irrevocable notice (which
     notice must be received by such Holder no less than three (3) Business Days
     prior to the requested date of the Holder Advance) specifying (i) the
     amount to be advanced (which on any date shall not be in excess of the then
     Available Holder Commitment), (ii) the requested date of advance, (iii)
     whether the Holder Advance is to be a Eurodollar Holder Advance or an ABR
     Holder Advance or a combination thereof, (iv) if the Holder Advance is to
     be a combination of Eurodollar Holder Advances and ABR Holder Advances, the
     respective amounts of each type of Holder Advance and (v) the Interest
     Period applicable to any Eurodollar Holder Advances. Pursuant to the terms
     of the Participation Agreement, the Agent shall be deemed to have delivered
     such notice upon the delivery of a notice by the Construction Agent or
     Lessee containing such required information.

          (b) Upon receipt of any such notice delivered pursuant to Section
     3.1(a), each Holder shall make the amount of its Advance available to the
     Agent for the account of the Owner Trustee at the office of the Agent
     referred to in Section 12.2 of the Participation Agreement (or at such
     other address as may be identified by the Agent from time to time) prior to
     12:00 Noon, Eastern time on the date requested by Lessee in funds
     immediately available to the Owner Trustee.

          (c) Holder Yield accruing on each Holder Advance during the
     Construction Period with respect to any property shall, subject to the
     limitations set forth in Section 5.1(b) of the Participation Agreement, be
     added to the amount of the Holder Advance on the relevant Scheduled
     Interest Payment Date. On such Scheduled Interest Payment Date, the Holder
     Property Cost and Holder Construction Property Cost shall be increased by
     the amount of Holder Yield added to the Holder Advance.

                                        4

<PAGE>

          (d) The Holder Advances made by each Holder to the Trust Estate shall
     be evidenced by a Certificate of the Owner Trustee, substantially in the
     form of Exhibit A hereto, issued in the name of the Holder and in an amount
     equal to the Holder Commitment of such Holder. Each Certificate shall (i)
     be dated on or about the Initial Closing Date, (ii) be stated to mature on
     the Maturity Date and (iii) bear a yield on the unpaid Holder Amount
     thereof from time to time outstanding at the Holder Yield.

          (e) To the extent that the Owner Trustee, in its capacity as Borrower
     under the Credit Agreement, shall have elected to terminate or reduce the
     amount of the Commitments pursuant to Section 2.5(a) of the Credit
     Agreement, a pro rata election shall be deemed to have been made with
     respect to the Holder Commitment. The Holder Commitments respecting any
     particular Property shall automatically be reduced to zero (0) upon the
     occurrence of the Rent Commencement Date respecting such Property. On any
     date on which the Commitments shall be reduced to zero (0) as a result of a
     Credit Agreement Event of Default, the Holder Commitments shall
     automatically be reduced to zero (0) and the Owner Trustee shall prepay the
     Certificates in full for the outstanding Holder Amount, together with
     accrued but unpaid Holder Yield thereon and all other amounts owing under
     the Certificates.

     SECTION 3.2 Holder Yield.

          (a) Holder Advances shall bear yield payable by the Owner Trustee and
     calculated at the rate of Holder Yield applicable from time to time. The
     Owner Trustee shall pay to each Holder, from the Trust Estate, its pro rata
     portion of Holder Yield on Holder Advances made hereunder. Payment of
     Holder Yield to each Holder shall be made in arrears on each Scheduled
     Interest Payment Date occurring after the Rent Commencement Date or as
     otherwise provided herein or in Section 2.6 of the Credit Agreement or
     Section 8.7 of the Participation Agreement.

          (b) If (i) all or a portion of Holder Yield shall not be received by
     the Holders when due (whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or
     otherwise) or (ii) (A) a replacement Construction Agent is hired in
     accordance with the provisions of the Agency Agreement, (B) Completion of
     all Properties has not occurred on prior to the Construction Period
     Termination Date or (C) the cost of any Property exceeds the original
     Construction Budget therefor (or the applicable Construction Budget
     modified in accordance with the Operative Agreements) in each case as
     previously delivered to the Agent, such overdue amount (in the case of
     Section 3.2(b)(i)) or all Holder Advances, Holder Yield and all other
     amounts payable hereunder (in the case of Section 3.2(b)(ii)) shall,
     without limiting the rights of the Holders hereunder or under any Operative
     Agreement, bear interest at the Holder Overdue Rate, in each case from the
     date of nonpayment until paid (whether after or before judgment) (in the
     case of Section 3.2(b)(i)) or (y) Completion of all Properties (in the case
     of Section 3.2(b)(ii)). All such amounts referenced in this Section 3.2(b)
     shall be paid upon demand.

                                        5

<PAGE>

     SECTION 3.3 Scheduled Return of Holder Advances.

     The outstanding Holder Amount shall be due in full on the Expiration Date.
On each such date and on the Expiration Date, subject to the terms of the
Participation Agreement, the Owner Trustee shall pay to each Holder its portion
of the aggregate Holder Amount then due, together with all accrued but unpaid
Holder Yield and all other amounts due to such Holders from the Owner Trustee
hereunder or under the Operative Agreements.

     SECTION 3.4 Early Return of Advances.

          (a) Subject to Sections 11.2(e), 11.3 and 11.4 of the Participation
     Agreement, the Owner Trustee may at any time and from time to time prepay
     the Certificates, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty, upon at
     least three (3) Business Days' irrevocable notice to the Agent, on behalf
     of the Holders, specifying the date and amount of prepayment and whether
     the prepayment is of ABR Holder Advances or Eurodollar Holder Advances or a
     combination thereof, and, if a combination thereof, the amount allocable to
     each. Upon receipt of such notice, the Agent shall promptly notify the
     Holders thereof. If such notice is given, the amount specified in such
     notice shall be due and payable on the date specified therein. Amounts
     prepaid shall not be readvanced, except as set forth in Section 5.2(d) of
     the Participation Agreement.

          (b) If on any date the Agent or the Owner Trustee shall receive any
     payment in respect of (i) any Casualty, Condemnation or Environmental
     Violation pursuant to Sections 15.1(a) or 15.1(g) or Article XVI of the
     Lease (excluding any payments in respect thereof which are payable to
     Lessee in accordance with the Lease), or (ii) the Termination Value of any
     Property in connection with the delivery of a Termination Notice pursuant
     to Article XVI of the Lease, or (iii) the Termination Value of any Property
     or such other applicable amount in connection with the exercise of a
     Purchase Option under Article XX of the Lease or the exercise of the option
     of the Owner Trustee to transfer the Properties to the Lessee pursuant to
     Section 20.3 of the Lease or (iv) any payment required to be made or
     elected to be made by the Construction Agent to the Owner Trustee pursuant
     to the Agency Agreement, then in each case, the Holders shall receive
     proceeds in accordance with Section 8.7(b) of the Participation Agreement.

          (c) Each prepayment of the Certificates pursuant to Section 3.4(a)
     shall be allocated to reduce the respective Holder Property Costs of all
     Properties pro rata according to the Holder Property Costs of such
     Properties immediately before giving effect to such prepayment. Each
     prepayment of the Certificates pursuant to Section 3.4(b) shall be
     allocated to reduce the Holder Property Cost of the Property or Properties
     subject to the respective Casualty, Condemnation, Environmental Violation,
     termination, purchase, transfer or other circumstance giving rise to such
     prepayment.

                                        6

<PAGE>

     SECTION 3.5 Payments from Trust Estate Only.

     All payments to be made by the Owner Trustee under this Trust Agreement
(including without limitation any payments pursuant to Section 11.4 of the
Participation Agreement) shall be made only from the income and proceeds from
the Trust Estate and only to the extent that the Owner Trustee shall have
received income or proceeds from the Trust Estate to make such payments in
accordance with the terms hereof, except as specifically provided in Section
6.1. Each Holder agrees that it will look solely to the income and proceeds from
the Trust Estate to the extent available for payment as herein provided and
that, except as specially provided in any Operative Agreement, Trust Company
shall not be liable to any Holder for any amounts payable under this Trust
Agreement and shall not be subject to any liability under this Trust Agreement.

     SECTION 3.6 Method of Payment.

     All amounts payable to a Holder pursuant to this Trust Agreement shall be
paid or caused to be paid by the Owner Trustee to, or for the account of, such
Holder, or its nominee, by transferring such amount in immediately available
funds to a bank institution or banking institutions with bank wire transfer
facilities for the account of such Holder or as otherwise instructed in writing
from time to time by such Holder.

     SECTION 3.7 Computation of Yield.

          (a) Whenever it is calculated on the basis of the Prime Lending Rate,
     Holder Yield shall be calculated on the basis of a year of three hundred
     sixty-five (365) days (or three hundred sixty-six (366) days, as the case
     may be) for the actual days elapsed; and, otherwise, Holder Yield shall be
     calculated on the basis of a year of three hundred sixty (360) days for the
     actual days elapsed. Any change in the Holder Yield resulting from a change
     in the ABR or the Eurocurrency Reserve Requirements shall become effective
     as of the opening of business on the day on which such change becomes
     effective.

          (b) Pursuant to Section 12.12 of the Participation Agreement, the
     calculation of Holder Yield under this Section 3.7 shall be made by the
     Agent. Each determination of an interest rate by the Agent shall be
     conclusive and binding on the Owner Trustee and the Holders in the absence
     of manifest error.

          (c) If the Eurodollar Rate cannot be determined by the Agent in the
     manner specified in the definition of the term "Eurodollar Rate", the Owner
     Trustee shall give or cause to be given telecopy or telephonic notice
     thereof to the Lessee and the Holders as soon as practicable after receipt
     of same from the Agent. Commencing on the Scheduled Interest Payment Date
     next occurring after the delivery of such notice and continuing until such
     time as the Eurodollar Rate can be determined by the Agent in the manner
     specified in the definition of such term, all outstanding Holder Advances
     shall bear a yield at the ABR. Until such time as the Eurodollar Rate can
     be determined by the Agent in the manner specified in the definition of
     such term, no further Eurodollar Holder Advances shall be made or shall be
     continued as such at the end of the then current

     Interest Period nor shall the Owner Trustee have the right to convert ABR
     Holder Advances to Eurodollar Holder Advances.

     SECTION 3.8 Conversion and Continuation Options.

          (a) The Owner Trustee may elect from time to time to convert
     Eurodollar Holder Advances to ABR Holder Advances by giving the Agent (on
     behalf of the Holders) at least three (3) Business Days' prior irrevocable
     notice of such election, provided, that any such conversion of Eurodollar
     Holder Advances may only be made on the last day of an Interest Period with
     respect thereto, and provided, further, to the extent an Event of Default
     has occurred and is continuing on the last day of any such Interest Period,
     the applicable Eurodollar Holder Advance shall automatically be converted
     to an ABR Holder Advance. The Owner Trustee may elect from time to time to
     convert ABR Holder Advances to Eurodollar Holder Advances by giving the
     Agent (on behalf of the Holders) at least three (3) Business Days' prior
     irrevocable notice of such election. Any such notice of conversion to
     Eurodollar Holder Advances shall specify the length of the initial Interest
     Period or Interest Periods therefor. Upon receipt of any such notice, the
     Agent (on behalf of the Holders) shall promptly notify each Holder thereof.
     All or any part of outstanding Eurodollar Holder Advances or ABR Holder
     Advances may be converted as provided herein, provided, that (i) no ABR
     Holder Advance may be converted into a Eurodollar Holder Advance after the
     date that is one (1) month prior to the Maturity Date and (ii) such notice
     of conversion shall contain an election by the Owner Trustee of an Interest
     Period for such Eurodollar Holder Advance to be created by such conversion
     and such Interest Period shall be in accordance with the terms of the
     definition of the term "Interest Period" including without limitation
     subparagraphs (A) through (D) thereof.

          (b) Subject to the restrictions set forth in Section 3.1, any
     Eurodollar Holder Advance may be continued as such upon the expiration of
     the then current Interest Period with respect thereto by the Owner Trustee
     giving irrevocable notice to the Agent (on behalf of the Holders) in
     accordance with the notice provisions for the conversion of ABR Holder
     Advances to Eurodollar Holder Advances set forth herein and the applicable
     provisions of the term "Interest Period" of the length of the next Interest
     Period to be applicable to such Eurodollar Holder Advances, provided, that
     no Eurodollar Holder Advance may be continued as such after the date that
     is one (1) month prior to the Maturity Date, provided, further, no
     Eurodollar Holder Advance may be continued as such if an Event of Default
     has occurred and is continuing as of the last day of the Interest Period
     for such Eurodollar Holder Advance, and provided, further, that if the
     Owner Trustee shall fail to give any required notice as described above or
     if such continuation is not permitted pursuant to the preceding proviso or
     otherwise, such Advances shall automatically be converted to ABR Advances
     on the last day of such then expiring Interest Period.

     SECTION 3.9 Notice of Amounts Payable.

          (a) In the event that any Holder becomes aware that any amounts are or
     will be owed to it pursuant to Sections 11.2(e) or 11.3 of the
     Participation Agreement or that it is unable to make Holder Advances which
     bear a yield based on the Eurodollar Rate plus the Applicable Percentage
     for Eurodollar Holder Advances, then it shall promptly notify the Owner
     Trustee thereof and, as soon as possible thereafter, such Holder shall
     submit to the Owner Trustee a certificate indicating the amount owing to it
     and the calculation thereof. The amounts set forth in such certificate
     shall be prima facie evidence of the obligations of the Owner Trustee
     hereunder.

          (b) [Intentionally Omitted]

     3.10 Increase in Holder Commitments.

     The parties to this Agreement hereby acknowledge that the Holder

                          COLLECTIONS AND DISTRIBUTIONS

     SECTION 4.1 Collections and Remittances by the Owner Trustee.

     The Owner Trustee agrees that, subject to the provisions of this Trust
Agreement and the Operative Agreements, it will during the term of this Trust

collect all Rent and other sums payable to the Owner Trustee by Lessee under the
Lease. The Owner Trustee agrees to distribute, or cause to be distributed, all
proceeds received from the Trust Estate in accordance with Article III and
Sections 4.2 and 4.3. The Owner Trustee shall make, or cause to be made, such
distribution promptly upon receipt of such proceeds (provided, such proceeds are
available for distribution) by the Agent (on behalf of the Owner Trustee), it
being understood and agreed that the Owner Trustee shall not be obligated to
make, or to cause to be made, such distribution until the funds for such
distribution have been received by the Agent (on behalf of the Owner Trustee) in
cash or its equivalent reasonably acceptable to the Owner Trustee.

     SECTION 4.2 Priority of Distributions.

     Subject to the terms and requirements of the Operative Agreements, all
payments and amounts received by Trust Company as the Owner Trustee or on its
behalf shall be distributed to the Agent for allocation by the Agent in

such payments or amounts are received by the Owner Trustee from the Agent, then
they shall be distributed forthwith upon receipt in the following order of
priority:

first, in accordance with the Holder Yield protection provisions set forth in
Section 11.3 of the Participation Agreement; and, second, the balance, if any,

Commitment to the aggregate of all the Holders' Holder Commitments).

     SECTION 4.3 Excepted Payments.

     Anything in this Article IV or elsewhere in this Trust Agreement to the
contrary notwithstanding, any Excepted Payment received at any time by the Owner
Trustee shall be distributed promptly to the Person entitled to receive such
Excepted Payment.

     SECTION 4.4 Distributions after Default.

     Subject to the terms of Section 5.1, the proceeds received by the Owner
Trustee from the exercise of any remedy under the Lease shall be distributed
pursuant to Section 4.2 above. This Trust shall cease and terminate in
accordance with the terms set forth in Section 8.1 and upon the final
disposition by the Owner Trustee of all of the Trust Estate pursuant to this

                                    ARTICLE V

                           DUTIES OF THE OWNER TRUSTEE

     SECTION 5.1 Notice of Certain Events.

     In the event the Owner Trustee shall have knowledge of any Default or Event
of Default, the Owner Trustee shall give written notice thereof within five (5)
Business Days to each Holder, Lessee and the Agent unless such Default or Event
of Default no longer exists before the giving of such notice. Subject to the
provisions of Section 5.3 of this Trust Agreement and Sections 8.5 and 9.2 of
the Participation Agreement, the Owner Trustee shall take or refrain from taking
such action as the Agent shall direct until such time as the Loans are paid in
full (and as more specifically provided in Sections 8.2(h) and 8.6 of the
Participation Agreement) and thereafter as the Majority Holders shall direct, in
each case by written instructions to the Owner Trustee. If the Owner Trustee
shall have given the Agent and the Holders (and respecting Sections 8.5 and 9.2
of the Participation Agreement, the Lessee) notice of any event and shall not
have received written instructions as above provided within thirty (30) days
after mailing notice of such event to the Agent and the Holders (and respecting
Sections 8.5 and 9.2 of the Participation Agreement, the Lessee), the Owner
Trustee may, but shall be under no duty to, and shall have no liability for its
failure or refusal to, take or refrain from taking any action with respect
thereto, not inconsistent with the provisions of the Operative Agreements, as
the Owner Trustee shall deem advisable and in the best interests of the Lenders
and the Holders. For all purposes of this Trust Agreement, in the absence of
actual knowledge of a Responsible Officer in the Corporate Trust Department of
Trust Company, the Owner Trustee shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any
Default or Event of Default unless a Responsible Officer of the Corporate Trust
Department of Trust Company receives notice thereof given by or on behalf of a
Holder, Lessee or the Agent.

     SECTION 5.2 Action Upon Instructions.

     Subject to the provisions of Sections 5.1 and 5.3, upon the written
instructions of the Agent or the Majority Holders (as applicable), the Owner
Trustee will take or refrain from taking such action or actions as may be
specified in such instructions.

     SECTION 5.3 Indemnification.

     The Owner Trustee shall not be required to take or refrain from taking any
action under this Trust Agreement or any other Operative Agreement (other than
the actions specified in the first sentence of Section 5.1 and in the last

Lessee or, at their election, by the Holders and the Lenders against any
liability, fee, cost or expense (including without limitation reasonable
attorneys' fees and expenses) that may be incurred or charged in connection
therewith, other than such as may result from the willful misconduct or gross
negligence of the Owner Trustee. The Owner Trustee shall not be required to take
any action under any Operative Agreement if the Owner Trustee shall reasonably
determine, or shall have been advised by counsel, that such action is likely to
result in personal liability for which the Owner Trustee has not been and will
not be adequately indemnified or is contrary to the terms hereof or of any
Operative Agreement to which the Owner Trustee is a party or is otherwise
contrary to law. The Owner Trustee shall be under no liability with respect to
any action taken or omitted to be taken by the Owner Trustee in accordance with
instructions of the Agent or the Majority Holders pursuant to Section 5.2.

     SECTION 5.4 No Duties Except as Specified In Trust Agreement or
                 Instructions.

     The Owner Trustee shall not have any duty or obligation to manage, control,
use, make any payment in respect of, register, record, insure, inspect, sell,
dispose of or otherwise deal with any Property or any other part of the Trust
Estate, or to otherwise take or refrain from taking any action under or in
connection with any Operative Agreement to which the Owner Trustee is a party,
except as expressly provided by the terms of this Trust Agreement or any other
Operative Agreement or in written instructions from the Agent and/or the
Majority Holders, as applicable, received pursuant to Sections 5.1, 5.2 or 8.4
of this Trust Agreement or Sections 8.2(h) or 8.6 of the Participation Agreement
or from the Lessee pursuant to Sections 8.5 or 9.2 of the Participation
Agreement; and no implied duties or obligations shall be read into this Trust
Agreement against the Owner Trustee. The Owner Trustee shall have no duty or
obligation to supervise or monitor the performance of the Construction Agent
pursuant to the Agency Agreement which for all purposes shall be an independent
contractor. The Owner Trustee nevertheless agrees that it will (in its
individual capacity and at its own cost and expense), promptly take all action
as may be necessary to discharge any Lessor Liens on any part of the Trust
Estate.

     in its capacity as the Owner Trustee, for the default or misconduct of any
     such agents, attorneys, accountants or auditors if such agents, attorneys,
     accountants or auditors shall have been selected by it in good faith.

warranties contained in Section 6.3 of this Trust Agreement or Section 6.1 of

     requested in writing by the Owner Trustee) in connection with the
     preparation of such tax returns. The Owner Trustee shall keep copies of all
     returns delivered to or filed by it.

          (b) The Owner Trustee, either in its trust or individual capacities,
     shall be under no obligation to appear in, prosecute or defend any action,
     which in its opinion may require it to incur any out-of-pocket expense or
     any liability unless the Owner Trustee shall be furnished with such
     reasonable security and indemnity by Lessee (or, at the election of the
     Majority Secured Parties, by the Holders and the Lenders) against such
     expense or liability as it may require. The Owner Trustee may, but shall be
     under no duty to, undertake such action as it may deem necessary at any and
     all times, without any further action by the Agent or any Holder to protect
     one (1) or more of the Properties and the rights and interests of the
     Holders pursuant to the terms of this Trust Agreement; provided, however,

shall be accompanied by the written agreement of each Holder assuming all the
obligations of the Owner Trustee under or contemplated by the Operative
Agreements and all other obligations of the Owner Trustee incurred by it as
trustee hereunder; provided, however, that each Holder agrees for the express

Agreements shall have been made, then the Holders hereby authorize the Owner
Trustee to: (a) terminate this Trust Agreement and the trusts created hereby and

the necessary transfer documents as contemplated by Section 8.4. The exercise of
such option by the Owner Trustee shall cause this Trust Agreement to be of no
further force and effect and shall release the Owner Trustee from all further
obligations of the Owner Trustee hereunder and under the agreements and other
instruments mentioned in the preceding sentence.

such event take such action as may be necessary or as may be requested by the
Majority Holders to transfer the Trust Estate pro rata to the Holders, including
without limitation the execution of instruments of transfer or assignment with
respect to any of the Operative Agreements to which the Owner Trustee is a
party.

                                   ARTICLE IX

                   SUCCESSOR OWNER TRUSTEES, CO-OWNER TRUSTEES
                           AND SEPARATE OWNER TRUSTEES

     SECTION 9.1 Resignation of the Owner Trustee; Appointment of Successor.

          (a) The Owner Trustee may resign at any time without cause by giving
     at least thirty (30) days' prior written notice to each Holder, the Agent
     and Lessee; provided, however, that such resignation shall not be effective
     until the acceptance of appointment by a successor Owner Trustee under
     Section 9.1(b). The Owner Trustee may be removed with or without cause at
     any time by the Majority Holders upon consent to such removal by the Agent
     and with sixty (60) days' prior written notice to the Owner Trustee, a copy
     of which notice shall be concurrently delivered by the Majority Holders to
     the Agent and Lessee. Any such removal shall be effective upon the
     acceptance of appointment by a successor Owner Trustee under Section
     9.1(b). In case of the resignation or removal of the Owner Trustee, the
     Holders may appoint a successor Owner Trustee by an instrument signed by
     the Majority Holders; provided, however, that such successor Owner Trustee
     must be approved by the Agent. In the event the Owner Trustee shall be an
     individual,

                                       17

<PAGE>

     his death or incapacity, or termination of employment (whether voluntary or
     involuntary) with First Security Bank, National Association (or a successor
     corporate Owner Trustee) shall be treated as a resignation hereunder and
     shall be effective immediately. If a successor Owner Trustee shall not have
     been appointed within thirty (30) days after the giving of written notice
     of such resignation or the delivery of the written instrument with respect
     to such removal, the Owner Trustee or any Holder may apply to any court of
     competent jurisdiction to appoint a successor Owner Trustee to act until
     such time, if any, as a successor shall have been appointed and shall have
     accepted its appointment as above provided. Any successor Owner Trustee so
     appointed by such court shall immediately and without further act be
     superseded by any successor Owner Trustee appointed as above provided
     within one (1) year from the date of the appointment by such court.

          (b) Any successor Owner Trustee, however appointed, shall execute and
     deliver to the predecessor Owner Trustee an instrument accepting such
     appointment, and thereupon such successor Owner Trustee, without further
     act shall become vested with all the estates, properties, rights, powers,
     duties and trusts of the predecessor Owner Trustee in the trusts hereunder
     with like effect as if originally named an Owner Trustee herein; but
     nevertheless, upon the written request of such successor Owner Trustee such
     predecessor Owner Trustee shall execute and deliver an instrument
     transferring to such successor Owner Trustee, upon the trusts herein
     expressed, all the estates, properties, rights, powers, duties and trusts
     of such predecessor Owner Trustee, and such predecessor Owner Trustee shall
     duly assign, transfer, deliver and pay over to such successor Owner Trustee
     all moneys or other property then held by such predecessor Owner Trustee
     upon the trusts herein expressed.

          (c) Any successor Owner Trustee, however appointed, shall be a bank or
     trust company incorporated and doing business within the United States of
     America and having a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000,
     if there be such an institution willing, able and legally qualified to
     perform the duties of the Owner Trustee hereunder upon reasonable or
     customary terms.

          (d) Any corporation into which the Owner Trustee may be merged or
     converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation
     resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which the Owner
     Trustee shall be a party, or any corporation to which substantially all the
     corporate trust business of the Owner Trustee may be transferred, shall,
     subject to the terms of Section 9.1(c), be the Owner Trustee under this
     Trust Agreement without further act.

     SECTION 9.2 Co-Trustees and Separate Trustees.

     Whenever the Owner Trustee or the Majority Holders shall deem it necessary
or prudent in order either (a) to conform to any law of any jurisdiction in
which all or any part of the Trust Estate shall be situated or to which it may
be subject or to make any claim or bring any suit with respect to the Trust
Estate or any Operative Agreement, (b) shall be advised by counsel

                                       18

<PAGE>

satisfactory to it that it is so necessary or prudent, or (c) the Owner Trustee
shall have been directed to do so by the Majority Holders and the Agent, the
Owner Trustee and the Holders shall execute and deliver an agreement
supplemental hereto and all other instruments and agreements, and shall take all
other action, necessary or proper to constitute one (1) or more Persons who need
not meet the requirements of Section 9.1(c) (and the Owner Trustee may appoint
one (1) or more of its officers) either as co-trustee or co-trustees (the
"Co-Owner Trustee"), jointly with the Owner Trustee, of all or any part of the
Trust Estate, or as separate trustee or separate trustees of all or any part of
the Trust Estate, and to vest in such Persons, in such capacity, such title to
the Trust Estate or any part thereof and such rights or duties as may be
necessary or desirable, all for such period and under such terms and conditions
as are satisfactory to the Owner Trustee and the Holders. In accordance with the
foregoing:

          (i) The Owner Trustee shall appoint a Co-Owner Trustee hereunder in
     part so that if, under any present or future law of any state where any
     Property is located or of any jurisdiction in which it may be necessary to
     perform any act in carrying out the trusts herein created, the Owner
     Trustee or any of its successors may be incompetent or unqualified or
     incapacitated or unwilling to perform certain acts as such Owner Trustee,
     then upon the written request of the Owner Trustee of any of its successors
     received by any Co-Owner Trustee, all of such acts required to be performed
     in such jurisdiction in the execution of the trust hereby created, shall
     and will be performed by any Co-Owner Trustee, or any of his successors, in
     trust acting alone, as if he or such successor had been specifically
     authorized so to do or had been the sole Owner Trustee hereunder. Any
     Co-Owner Trustee shall continue to perform such acts until otherwise
     directed in writing by the Owner Trustee or any of its successors. Any
     request in writing by the Owner Trustee or any of its successors to the
     Co-Owner Trustee shall be sufficient warrant for him to take such action as
     may be so requested.

          (ii) Except as it may be deemed necessary for any Co-Owner Trustee or
     any of his successors solely or jointly to execute the trusts herein
     created, the Owner Trustee or any of its successors shall solely have and
     exercise the powers, and shall be solely charged with the performance of
     the duties, hereinbefore declared on the part of the Owner Trustee to be
     had, exercised and performed; and any Co-Owner Trustee shall not be liable
     therefor. Any Co-Owner Trustee or any successor to him may delegate to the
     Owner Trustee or its successor hereunder the exercise of any power,
     discretion or otherwise, conferred by any provision of this Trust
     Agreement.

          (iii) Any act of the Owner Trustee herein required or authorized shall
     and will be jointly or separately performed by the Owner Trustee or its
     successors hereunder and by any Co-Owner Trustee or any of his successors
     appointed hereunder, if such joint performance or separate performance
     shall be necessary to the legality of such act and when so acting all
     references herein to "First Security Bank, National Association" shall be
     deemed to be references to such Co-Owner Trustee in its individual capacity
     and all references to "Owner Trustee" shall be deemed to be references to
     any Co-Owner Trustee, and such Co-Owner Trustee shall be entitled to all
     the protection, indemnification, immunity and compensation herein provided
     to the Owner Trustee

                                       19

<PAGE>

     acting singly in reference to such acts (subject to the limitations to such
     a protection, indemnification, immunity and compensation set forth herein).

          (iv) The Owner Trustee or its successor in trust shall have and is
     hereby given the power at any time by an instrument in writing duly
     executed by a Vice President, to remove any Co-Owner Trustee or his
     successor, from his position as Co-Owner Trustee hereunder. In the case of
     death, resignation, removal, incapacity or inability to act hereunder of
     the Co-Owner Trustee, or his successor as Co-Owner Trustee, any adult
     citizen of the United States of America may be appointed Co-Owner Trustee
     hereunder by the person who shall at the time be a Vice President of the
     corporation then acting as the Owner Trustee hereunder by an instrument in
     writing duly executed, and under its corporate seal, and, subject to its
     right to revoke such appointment or to appoint another person, the Owner
     Trustee shall appoint a successor Co-Owner Trustee, such appointment to be
     immediately effective in case of the death, resignation, removal or
     inability or incapacity to act hereunder of the Co-Owner Trustee. In the
     event a vacancy occurs in the office of the Co-Owner Trustee, either by
     reason of resignation, removal, incapacity or inability to act and no
     successor is appointed pursuant to the foregoing provisions within thirty
     (30) days after such vacancy occurs, the Holders and the Agent may jointly
     appoint a successor to the Co-Owner Trustee in the same manner as is
     provided for the appointment of a successor to the Co-Owner Trustee
     hereunder.

          (v) At any time or times, for the purposes of meeting the legal
     requirements of any jurisdiction in which any part of the Trust Estate
     hereunder may at the time be located, or to avoid any violation of law or
     imposition of taxes not otherwise imposed on the Owner Trustee, or if the
     Owner Trustee shall deem it desirable for its own protection, the Owner
     Trustee shall have power to appoint one (1) or more persons (who may be
     officers of the Owner Trustee either to act as an additional co-trustee,
     jointly with the Owner Trustee) of all or any part of the Trust Estate
     hereunder, or of any property constituting part thereof, or to act as
     separate trustee of any part of the Trust Estate in either case with such
     powers as may be provided in the instrument of appointment and are
     consistent with the terms hereof, and to vest in such person or persons in
     the capacity as aforesaid, any property, title, right or power deemed
     necessary or desirable, subject to the remaining provisions of this Section
     9.2.

          (vi) Notwithstanding any provision of this Trust Agreement to the
     contrary, any additional co-trustee shall act upon and be subject to the
     following terms and conditions:

               All rights, powers, duties and obligations conferred or imposed
          upon the Owner Trustee shall be conferred or imposed solely upon and
          solely exercised and performed by the Owner Trustee except to the
          extent that under any law of any jurisdiction in which any particular
          act or acts are to be performed the Owner Trustee or the Owner Trustee
          shall be incompetent or unqualified to perform such act or acts or to
          avoid any violation of law or imposition of taxes not otherwise
          imposed on the Owner Trustee, or if the Owner Trustee shall deem it
          desirable for

                                       20

<PAGE>

          its own protection, in which event such rights, powers, duties and
          obligations shall be exercised and performed by such co-trustee or
          Co-Owner Trustee.

          (vii) No power granted by this Trust Agreement to, or which this Trust
     Agreement provides may be exercised by, the Owner Trustee in respect of the
     custody, control and management of moneys may be exercised by any Co-Owner
     Trustee or any subsequently appointed co-trustee except jointly with, or
     with the consent in writing of, the Owner Trustee for disbursement or
     application in accordance with the terms hereof.

          (viii) All moneys which may be received or collected by any Co-Owner
     Trustee or such subsequently appointed co-trustees shall be paid over to
     the Owner Trustee to be distributed in accordance with this Trust Agreement
     and the other Operative Agreements.

          (ix) Any Co-Owner Trustee, or any subsequently appointed co-trustee to
     the extent permitted by law, does hereby constitute the Owner Trustee or
     its successors hereunder his or her agent or attorney in fact, with full
     power and authority to do any and all acts and things and exercise any and
     all discretion authorized or permitted by the Co-Owner Trustee or such
     subsequently appointed co-trustee, in its behalf or in its name.

          (x) No trustee hereunder shall be personally liable by reason of any
     act or omission of any other trustee hereunder.

     SECTION 9.3 Notice.

     At all times that a successor Owner Trustee is appointed pursuant to
Section 9.1, an Owner Trustee resigns pursuant to Section 9.1 or the Co-Owner
Trustee, a co-trustee or separate trustee, is appointed pursuant to Section 9.2,
the Holders shall give joint notice of such fact within thirty (30) days of its
occurrence to (x) Lessee, if the Lease is then in effect and (y) the Agent, if
the Credit Agreement is in effect.
