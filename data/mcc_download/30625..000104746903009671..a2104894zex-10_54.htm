SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Establishment of the Plan.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The name of the Plan is the Flowserve Corporation Performance Unit Plan
(hereinafter called the "Plan"). The effective date of the Plan is January&nbsp;1, 2001. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purpose.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the Plan is to provide an incentive to certain key employees of Flowserve Corporation
(the "Company") and of its subsidiary corporations to improve the earnings and performance of the Company. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Administration.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Plan shall be administered by the Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the Board
of Directors of the Company. No member of the Committee shall be eligible to participate in the Plan. The Committee shall have power to construe and interpret the Plan and to establish and amend
rules, regulations and forms for its administration and to certify all payments made under the Plan. The determination of the Committee on all matters relating to the Plan shall be conclusive. No
member of the Committee shall be liable for any action or determination made in good faith with respect to the Plan or any award thereunder. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eligibility.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees eligible to participate in the Plan shall be those key employees of the Company or any
subsidiary corporation whose efforts may have an effect upon the growth and performance of the Company and who shall be selected to participate in the Plan by the Committee or any successor thereto.
The eligibility date for selection by the Committee shall be January&nbsp;15 in the first year of each three-year cycle of the Plan ("Eligibility Date"). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Award of Performance Units.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Awards under the Plan consist of Performance Units. A Performance Unit is a
contingent right to receive cash if the Company meets the financial goals established by the Committee for a three-year cycle of the Plan. Annually, within 120&nbsp;days after the close
of the Company's fiscal year, the Committee may award to eligible employees Performance Units in such amounts so as to have a target value at the conclusion of a three-year cycle equal to
a pre-determined percentage of annual base salary at the time of the award. To determine the amount of an award to a non-U.S. employee, annual base salary in local currency
shall be converted into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rate on January&nbsp;31 (or the next business day) following the Employee's Eligibility Date. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Value of Performance Units.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with each award, the Committee shall establish a targeted
three-year compound growth rate in earnings per share of the Common Stock of the Company for such three-year cycle of the Plan. The targeted value of a Performance Unit shall
be equal to the sum of the annual earnings per share targets for the three-year cycle. The final value of a Performance Unit shall be equal to (i)&nbsp;the actual earnings per share for
the three full fiscal years beginning with the fiscal year in which an award of a Performance Unit is made to an employee multiplied by (ii)&nbsp;a performance multiplier set at the discretion of
the Committee and based on the annual growth rate in earnings per share during the three-year cycle by comparing, upon a compounded basis, the earnings per share for the final year of the
cycle with the earnings per share during the fiscal year immediately preceding the award of a Performance Unit. Earnings per share for any fiscal year will be determined by reference to the published
financial reports of the Company by dividing reported consolidated net income for the year by the reported average number of common shares outstanding, during such year. </FONT></P>

Control. Change in Control shall mean any Change in Control of a nature that would be required to be reported in response to Item 6(e) of Schedule&nbsp;14A of
Regulation&nbsp;14A promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"). Without limitation, such a Change in Control shall be deemed to have occurred upon the occurrence of
any of the following: </FONT></P>

"Person" (within the meaning of Articles 13(d) and 14(d)(2) of the Exchange Act), other than the Company or affiliates controlled by the Company,
becomes the beneficial owner (within the meaning of Rule&nbsp;13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of 20% or more of either: (a)&nbsp;the then outstanding
common shares of the Company (the "Outstanding Shares") or (b)&nbsp;the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities of the Company entitled to vote generally in the election of
directors (the "Voting Power"); provided, however, that such beneficial ownership shall not constitute a Change in Control if it occurs as a result of any of the following acquisitions of securities:
(1)&nbsp;any acquisition directly from the Company, (2)&nbsp;any acquisition by the Company or any corporation, partnership, trust or other entity controlled by the Company (a "Subsidiary"),
(3)&nbsp;any acquisition by any employee benefit plan (or related trust) sponsored or maintained by the Company or any Subsidiary or (4)&nbsp;any acquisition by any corporation pursuant to a
reorganization, merger or consolidation, if, following such reorganization, merger or consolidation, the conditions described in clauses (a)&nbsp;or (b)&nbsp;of Section&nbsp;7(C)(iii)&nbsp;are
satisfied. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Change in Control shall not be deemed to occur solely because any Person (the "Subject Person") became the beneficial owner of 20% or more of the
Outstanding Shares or Voting Power as a result of the acquisition of Outstanding Shares or Voting Power by the Company, including any affiliates defined in clauses (i)(b)(2) or (i)(b)(3) of this
Section&nbsp;7(C), which, by reducing the number of Outstanding Shares or Voting Power, increases the proportional number of shares beneficially owned by the Subject Person; provided, that if a
Change in Control would be deemed to have occurred (but for the operation of this sentence) as a result of the acquisition of Outstanding Shares or Voting Power by the Company, and after such share
acquisition by the Company, the Subject Person becomes the beneficial owner of any additional Outstanding Shares or Voting Power which increases the percentage of the Outstanding Shares or Voting
