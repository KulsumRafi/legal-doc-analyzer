is established to provide equity incentives for certain nonemployee members of the Board of Directors of Click2learn,&nbsp;Inc., formerly Asymetrix Learning Systems,&nbsp;Inc. (the </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><B><I>"Company"</I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>),
who are described in Section&nbsp;6.1 below, by granting such persons (or, if any such person is a representative of an entity that is a
shareholder of the Company and such person so requests, to such entity) are options to purchase shares of stock of the Company. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><B>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adoption and Stockholder Approval</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>.&nbsp;&nbsp;After this Plan is adopted by the Board of Directors of the Company (the </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><B><I>"Board"</I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>), this
Plan will become effective on the time and date (the </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>"Effective Date"</I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>) on which the
registration statement filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission (</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>"SEC"</I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><B><I>"Securities
Act"</I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>), to register the initial public offering of the Company's Common Stock is declared effective by the SEC. This Plan shall be approved
by the stockholders of the Company, consistent with applicable laws, within twelve (12)&nbsp;months after the date this Plan is adopted by the Board. </FONT></P>

the Common Stock of the Company. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><B>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Number of Shares</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The maximum number of Shares that may be issued pursuant to Options granted under this Plan
(the </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>"Maximum Number"</I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>) is 487,500 Shares, subject to adjustment as provided in this Plan. If any Option is terminated for any reason without being
exercised in whole or in part, the Shares thereby released from such Option shall be available for purchase under other Options subsequently granted under this Plan. At all times during the term of
this Plan, the Company shall reserve and keep
available such number of Shares as shall be required to satisfy the requirements of outstanding Options granted under this Plan; provided, however that if the aggregate number of Shares subject to
outstanding Options granted under this Plan plus the aggregate number of Shares previously issued by the Company pursuant to the exercise of Options granted under this Plan equals or exceeds the
Maximum Number, then notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no further Options may be granted under this Plan until the Maximum Number is increased or the aggregate number of Shares subject
to outstanding Options granted under this Plan plus the aggregate number of Shares previously issued by the Company pursuant to the exercise of Options granted under this Plan is less than the Maximum
Number. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT

of the Board appointed to administer this Plan (the </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>"Committee"</I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>). As used in this Plan, references to the Committee shall mean either such Committee or
the Board if no Committee has been established. The interpretation by the Committee of any of the provisions of this Plan or any Option granted under this Plan shall be final and binding upon the
Company and all persons having an interest in any Option or any Shares purchased pursuant to an Option. </FONT></P>
