                              CONDITIONS PRECEDENT

            (a) each of the representations and warranties made by the Borrowers
or their Subsidiaries in or pursuant to the Loan Documents is true and correct
in all material respects (except that any such representation or warranty that
is expressly stated as being made only as of a specified earlier date shall be
true and correct in all material respects as of such earlier date);

            (b) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing;

such claim or lien has arisen) and the Final Order is in full force and effect
and has not been stayed, modified, amended, reversed, rescinded or vacated.

            SECTION 3.1. Execution of this Agreement. This Agreement is executed
and shall be construed as the Third Amendment to the Postpetition Credit
Agreement, and, as provided in the Credit Agreement, this Agreement forms a part
thereof and is a Loan Document.

            SECTION 3.2. No Amendment or Waiver. This Agreement shall not
constitute an amendment or waiver of, or consent to any provision of, the Credit
Agreement or any other Loan Document not expressly referred to herein and shall
not be construed as an amendment, waiver or consent to any action on the part of
the Borrowers that would require an amendment, waiver or consent of the Agent or
the Lenders except as expressly stated herein. The execution, delivery


                                       2
<PAGE>
and performance by the parties hereto of this Agreement shall not constitute a
waiver, forbearance or other indulgence with respect to any Default or Event of
Default now existing or hereafter arising, except as expressly set forth herein.
Except as specifically modified pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the
terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents remain
in full force and effect. Nothing herein shall limit in any way the rights and
remedies of the Agent and the Lenders under the Credit Agreement and the other
Loan Documents.

            SECTION 3.3. Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness. This
Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto on
different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of
which when taken together shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement

matter hereof and supersedes any and all previous agreements and understandings,
oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof. Upon the effectiveness
of this Agreement as set forth in Article II hereof, this Agreement shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and, subject to and
in accordance with SECTION 12.6 of the Credit Agreement, their respective
successors and assigns. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page

the Loan Documents shall continue to be in full force and effect and are hereby
in all respects ratified and confirmed.

            SECTION 3.5. Severability. Any provision of this Agreement held to
be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such
jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and enforceability of
the remaining provisions hereof; and the invalidity of a particular provision in
a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other
jurisdiction.

            SECTION 3.6. Expenses. The Borrowers agree to pay or reimburse the
Agent for all of its reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement, any other documents prepared in connection
herewith and the transactions contemplated hereby, including, without
limitation, the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel to the Agent.

            SECTION 3.7. Governing Law. THIS AGREEMENT AND THE RIGHTS AND
OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES UNDER THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND
CONSTRUED AND INTERPRETED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE INTERNAL LAW OF THE STATE OF
NEW YORK WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO THE CONFLICT OF LAWS PROVISIONS THEREOF THAT
WOULD DIRECT THE APPLICATION OF THE LAW OF ANOTHER JURISDICTION, ALL TO THE
EXTENT NOT PREEMPTED BY THE FEDERAL BANKRUPTCY LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES;
PROVIDED, THAT THE LENDERS AND AGENT SHALL RETAIN ALL RIGHTS ARISING UNDER
