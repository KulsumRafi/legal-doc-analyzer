The Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Restatement Lenders
of the Restatement Effective Date, and such notice shall be conclusive and
binding. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the consummation of the transactions set
forth in Sections 3 and 4 of this Agreement shall not become effective unless

Administrative Agent. This Agreement may not be amended nor may any provision
hereof be waived except pursuant to a writing signed by Holdings, the Borrower,
the Administrative Agent and the Restatement Lenders. This Agreement may be
executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall constitute an original
but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract.
Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by
telecopy or other electronic transmission shall be effective as delivery of a
manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.

contained shall be construed as a substitution or novation of the Indebtedness
outstanding under the Existing Credit Agreement, which (except to the extent
paid as provided herein) shall remain outstanding after the Restatement
Effective Date as modified hereby. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement, the provisions of Sections 2.14, 2.15, 2.16 and 9.03 of the Existing
Credit Agreement as in effect immediately prior to the Restatement Effective
Date will continue to be effective as to all matters arising out of or in any
way related to facts or events existing or occurring prior to the Restatement
Effective Date.

the close of business on the earlier of (i) the date one year after the date of
the issuance of such Letter of Credit (or, in the case of any renewal or
extension thereof, one year after such renewal or extension) and (ii) the date
that is five Business Days prior to the Revolving Maturity Date.

         (d) Participations. By the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or an
amendment to a Letter of Credit increasing the amount thereof) and without any
further action on the part of the Issuing Bank or the Lenders, the Issuing Bank
hereby grants to each Revolving Lender, and each Revolving Lender hereby
acquires from the Issuing Bank, a participation in such Letter of Credit equal
to such Lender's Applicable Percentage of the aggregate amount available to be
drawn under such Letter of Credit. In consideration and in furtherance of the
foregoing, each Revolving Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to
pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Issuing Bank, such
Lender's Applicable Percentage of each LC Disbursement made by the Issuing Bank
and not reimbursed by the Borrower on the date due as provided in paragraph (e)
of this Section, or of any reimbursement payment required to be refunded to the
Borrower for any reason. Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation
to acquire participations pursuant to this paragraph in respect of Letters of
Credit is absolute and

                                                                              38




unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever,
including any amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or the
occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the
Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset,
abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever.

         (e) Reimbursement. If the Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement
in respect of a Letter of Credit, the Borrower shall reimburse such LC
Disbursement by paying to the Administrative Agent an amount equal to such LC
Disbursement not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the date that
such LC Disbursement is made, if the Borrower shall have received notice of such
LC Disbursement prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on such date, or, if
such notice has not been received by the Borrower prior to such time on such
date, then not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on (i) the Business
Day that the Borrower receives such notice, if such notice is received prior to
10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the day of receipt, or (ii) the Business Day
immediately following the day that the Borrower receives such notice, if such
notice is not received prior to such time on the day of receipt; provided that
the Borrower may, subject to the conditions to borrowing set forth herein,
request in accordance with Section 2.03 that such payment be financed with an
ABR Revolving Borrowing in an equivalent amount and, to the extent so financed,
the Borrower's obligation to make such payment shall be discharged and replaced
by the resulting ABR Revolving Borrowing. If the Borrower fails to make such
payment when due, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Revolving Lender of
the applicable LC Disbursement, the payment then due from the Borrower in
respect thereof and such Lender's Applicable Percentage thereof. Promptly
following receipt of such notice, each Revolving Lender shall pay to the
Administrative Agent its Applicable Percentage of the payment then due from the
Borrower, in the same manner as provided in Section 2.05 with respect to Loans
made by such Lender (and Section 2.05 shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the
payment obligations of the Revolving Lenders), and the Administrative Agent
shall promptly pay to the Issuing Bank the amounts so received by it from the
Revolving Lenders. Promptly following receipt by the Administrative Agent of any
payment from the Borrower pursuant to this paragraph, the Administrative Agent
shall distribute such payment to the Issuing Bank or, to the extent that
Revolving Lenders have made payments pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse the
Issuing Bank, then to such Lenders and the Issuing Bank as their interests may
appear. Any payment made by a Revolving Lender pursuant to this paragraph to
reimburse the Issuing Bank for any LC

                                                                              39



Disbursement (other than the funding of ABR Revolving Loans as contemplated
above) shall not constitute a Loan and shall not relieve the Borrower of its
obligation to reimburse such LC Disbursement.

         (f) Obligations Absolute. The Borrower's obligation to reimburse LC
Disbursements as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section shall be absolute,
unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances whatsoever and
irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of
Credit or this Agreement, or any term or provision therein, (ii) any draft or
other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged,
fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or
inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment by the Issuing Bank under a Letter of
Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply
with the terms of such Letter of Credit, or (iv) any other event or circumstance
whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for
the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or
provide a right of setoff against, the Borrower's obligations hereunder. Neither
the Administrative Agent, the Lenders nor the Issuing Bank, nor any of their
Related Parties, shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in
connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment
or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the
circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission,
interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or
other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any
document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of
technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the
Issuing Bank; provided that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse the
Issuing Bank from liability to the Borrower to the extent of any direct damages
(as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby
waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by
the Borrower that are caused by the Issuing Bank's failure to exercise care when
determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of
Credit comply with the terms thereof. The parties hereto expressly agree that,
in the absence of gross negligence or wilful misconduct on the part of the
Issuing Bank (as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction), the
Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have exercised care in each such determination.
In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the

                                                                              40



generality thereof, the parties agree that, with respect to documents presented
that appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a
Letter of Credit, the Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion, either accept
and make payment upon such documents without responsibility for further
investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, or
refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents are not
in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit.

                (g) Disbursement Procedures. The Issuing Bank shall, promptly
following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a
demand for payment under a Letter of Credit. The Issuing Bank shall promptly
notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower by telephone (confirmed by
telecopy) of such demand for payment and whether the Issuing Bank has made or
will make an LC Disbursement thereunder; provided that any failure to give or
delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to
reimburse the Issuing Bank and the Revolving Lenders with respect to any such LC
Disbursement.

                (h) Interim Interest. If the Issuing Bank shall make any LC
Disbursement, then, unless the Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement in
full on the date such LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall
bear interest, for each day from and including the date such LC Disbursement is
made to but excluding the date that the Borrower reimburses such LC
Disbursement, at the rate per annum then applicable to ABR Revolving Loans;
provided that, if the Borrower fails to reimburse such LC Disbursement when due
pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section, then Section 2.12(c) shall apply.
Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be for the account of the
Issuing Bank, except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by
any Revolving Lender pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section to reimburse the
Issuing Bank shall be for the account of such Lender to the extent of such
payment.

                (i) Replacement of the Issuing Bank. The Issuing Bank may be
replaced at any time by written agreement among the Borrower, the Administrative
Agent, the replaced Issuing Bank and the successor Issuing Bank. The
Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders of any such replacement of the
Issuing Bank. At the time any such replacement shall become effective, the
Borrower shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for the account of the replaced
Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.11(b). From and after the effective date of
any such replacement, (i) the successor Issuing Bank shall have all the rights
and obligations of the Issuing






<PAGE>

                                                                              41




Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit to be issued
thereafter and (ii) references herein to the term "Issuing Bank" shall be deemed
to refer to such successor or to any previous Issuing Bank, or to such successor
and all previous Issuing Banks, as the context shall require. After the
replacement of an Issuing Bank hereunder, the replaced Issuing Bank shall remain
a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of an
Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it
prior to such replacement, but shall not be required to issue additional Letters
of Credit.

                (j) Cash Collateralization. If any Event of Default shall occur
and be continuing, on the Business Day that the Borrower receives notice from
the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders (or, if the maturity of the
Loans has been accelerated, Revolving Lenders with LC Exposure representing
greater than 50% of the total LC Exposure) demanding the deposit of cash
collateral pursuant to this paragraph, the Borrower shall deposit in an account
with the Administrative Agent, in the name of the Administrative Agent and for
the benefit of the Lenders, an amount in cash equal to 105% of the LC Exposure
as of such date plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon; provided that the
obligation to deposit such cash collateral shall become effective immediately,
and such deposit shall become immediately due and payable, without demand or
other notice of any kind, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default with
respect to the Borrower described in clause (h) or (i) of Article VII. Each such
deposit shall be held by the Administrative Agent as collateral for the payment
and performance of the obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement. The
Administrative Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control, including the
exclusive right of withdrawal, over such account. Other than any interest earned
on the investment of such deposits, which investments shall be made at the
option and sole discretion of the Administrative Agent and at the Borrower's
risk and expense, such deposits shall not bear interest. Interest or profits, if
any, on such investments shall accumulate in such account. Moneys in such
account shall be applied by the Administrative Agent to reimburse the Issuing
Bank for LC Disbursements for which it has not been reimbursed and, to the
extent not so applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement
obligations of the Borrower for the LC Exposure at such time or, if the maturity
of the Loans has been accelerated (but subject to the consent of Revolving
Lenders with LC Exposure representing greater than 50% of the total LC
Exposure), be applied to satisfy other obligations of the Borrower under






<PAGE>


                                                                              42




this Agreement. If the Borrower is required to provide an amount of cash
collateral hereunder as a result of the occurrence of an Event of Default, such
amount (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to the
Borrower within three Business Days after all Events of Default have been cured
or waived.

                SECTION 2.05. Funding of Borrowings. (a) Each Lender shall make
each Loan to be made by it hereunder on the proposed date thereof by wire
transfer of immediately available funds by 12:00 noon, New York City time, to
the account of the Administrative Agent most recently designated by it for such
purpose by notice to the Lenders. The Administrative Agent will make such Loans
available to the Borrower by promptly crediting the amounts so received, in like
funds, to an account of the Borrower maintained with the Administrative Agent in
New York City and designated by the Borrower in the applicable Borrowing
Request; provided that ABR Revolving Loans made to finance the reimbursement of
an LC Disbursement as provided in Section 2.04(e) shall be remitted by the
Administrative Agent to the Issuing Bank.

                (b) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice
from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing that such Lender will
not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's share of such
Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such
share available on such date in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section
and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a
corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share
of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the
applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative
Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for
each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the
Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at
(i) in the case of such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate
and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking
industry rules on interbank compensation or (ii) in the case of the Borrower,
the interest rate applicable to ABR Loans. If such Lender pays such amount to
the Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lender's Loan
included in such Borrowing.

                SECTION 2.06. Interest Elections. (a) Each Revolving Borrowing
and Term Borrowing initially shall be of the Type specified in the applicable
Borrowing Request and, in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, shall have an
initial






<PAGE>






                                                                              43




Interest Period as specified in such Borrowing Request. Thereafter, the Borrower
may elect to convert such Borrowing to a different Type or to continue such
Borrowing and, in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, may elect Interest Periods
therefor, all as provided in this Section. The Borrower may elect different
options with respect to different portions of the affected Borrowing, in which
case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the
Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such portion
shall be considered a separate Borrowing.

                (b) To make an election pursuant to this Section, the Borrower
shall notify the Administrative Agent of such election by telephone by the time
that a Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03 if the Borrower
were requesting a Revolving Borrowing of the Type resulting from such election
to be made on the effective date of such election. Each such telephonic Interest
Election Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by hand
delivery or telecopy to the Administrative Agent of a written Interest Election
Request in a form approved by the Administrative Agent and signed by the
Borrower.

                (c) Each telephonic and written Interest Election Request shall
specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02 and paragraph
(f) of this Section:

                (i) the Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request
        applies and, if different options are being elected with respect to
        different portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each
        resulting Borrowing (in which case the information to be specified
        pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) below shall be specified for each
        resulting Borrowing);

                (ii) the effective date of the election made pursuant to such
        Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day;

                (iii) whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing
        or a Eurodollar Borrowing; and

              (iv) if the resulting Borrowing is a Eurodollar Borrowing, the
        Interest Period to be applicable thereto after giving effect to such
        election, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the
        term "Interest Period".







<PAGE>









                                                                              44





If any such Interest Election Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing but does
not specify an Interest Period, then the Borrower shall be deemed to have
selected an Interest Period of one month's duration.

                (d) Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request,
the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of
such Lender's portion of each resulting Borrowing.

                (e) If the Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest Election
Request with respect to a Eurodollar Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest
Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided
herein, at the end of such Interest Period such Borrowing shall be converted to
an ABR Borrowing. Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent, at the
request of the Required Lenders, so notifies the Borrower, then, so long as an
Event of Default is continuing (i) no outstanding Borrowing may be converted to
or continued as a Eurodollar Borrowing and (ii) unless repaid, each Eurodollar
Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing at the end of the Interest
Period applicable thereto.

                (f) A Borrowing of any Class may not be converted to or
continued as a Eurodollar Borrowing if after giving effect thereto (i) the
Interest Period therefor would commence before and end after a date on which any
principal of the Loans of such Class is scheduled to be repaid and (ii) the sum
of the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Eurodollar Borrowings of such
Class with Interest Periods ending on or prior to such scheduled repayment date
plus the aggregate principal amount of outstanding ABR Borrowings of such Class
would be less than the aggregate principal amount of Loans of such Class
required to be repaid on such scheduled repayment date.

                SECTION 2.07. Termination and Reduction of Commitments. (a)
Unless previously terminated, the Revolving Commitments shall terminate on the
Revolving Maturity Date.

                (b) The Borrower may at any time terminate, or from time to time
reduce, the Commitments of any Class; provided that (i) each reduction of the
Commitments of any Class shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of
$100,000 and not less than $2,500,000 and (ii) the Borrower shall not terminate
or reduce the Revolving Commitments if, after giving effect to any concurrent
prepayment of the






<PAGE>





                                                                              45




Revolving Loans in accordance with Section 2.10, the sum of the Revolving
Exposures would exceed the total Revolving Commitments.

                (c) In the event that, on the date on which any prepayment would
be required pursuant to Section 2.10(c) or 2.10(e), no Term Borrowings remain
outstanding or the amount of the prepayment required by Section 2.10(c) or
2.10(e), as the case may be, exceeds the aggregate principal amount of Term
Borrowings then outstanding, the Borrower shall reduce the Revolving Commitments
by an amount equal to the excess of the required prepayment over the principal
amount, if any, of Term Borrowings actually prepaid.

                (d) The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of any
election to terminate or reduce the Commitments under paragraph (b) of this
Section, or any required reduction of the Revolving Commitments under paragraph
(c) of this Section, at least three Business Days prior to the effective date of
such termination or reduction, specifying such election and the effective date
thereof. Promptly following receipt of any notice, the Administrative Agent
shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each notice delivered by the
Borrower pursuant to this Section shall be irrevocable; provided that a notice
of termination of the Revolving Commitments delivered by the Borrower may state
that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit
facilities, in which case such notice may be revoked by the Borrower (by notice
to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such
condition is not satisfied. Any termination or reduction of the Commitments of
any Class shall be permanent. Each reduction of the Commitments of any Class
shall be made ratably among the Lenders in accordance with their respective
commitments of such Class.

                SECTION 2.08. Repayment of Loans; Evidence of Debt. (a) The
Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to pay (i) to the Administrative Agent
for the account of each Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each
Revolving Loan of such Lender on the Revolving Maturity Date and (ii) to the
Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender the then unpaid principal
amount of each Term Loan of such Lender as provided in Section 2.09.

                (b) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual
practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower to
such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender, including the amounts
of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time
hereunder.


<PAGE>





                                                                              46




                (c) The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which it
shall record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Class and Type
thereof and the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any
principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the
Borrower to each Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by
the Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of the Lenders and each
Lender's share thereof.

                (d) The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to
paragraph (b) or (c) of this Section shall be prima facie evidence of the
existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein; provided that the
failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or
any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower
to repay the Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

                (e) Any Lender may request that Loans of any Class made by it be
evidenced by a promissory note. In such event, the Borrower shall prepare,
execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note payable to the order of
such Lender (or, if requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its registered
assigns) and in a form approved by the Administrative Agent. Thereafter, the
Loans evidenced by such promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times
be represented by one or more promissory notes in such form payable to the order
of the payee named therein (or, if such promissory note is a registered note, to
such payee and its registered assigns).

                SECTION 2.09. Amortization of Term Loans. (a) Subject to
adjustment pursuant to paragraph (d) of this

                The foregoing amortization schedule reflects all prepayments of
the Delayed Draw Acquisition Borrowings on or made prior to the Restatement
Date.

                (c) To the extent not previously paid, (i) all
Tranche A Term Loans shall be due and payable on the Tranche A Term Loan
Maturity Date and (ii) all Delayed Draw

                                                                              48




Acquisition Loans shall be due and payable on the Delayed Draw Acquisition Loan
Maturity Date.

                (d) Any prepayment of a Term Borrowing on or after the
Restatement Effective Date of either Class shall be applied to reduce the
subsequent scheduled repayments of the Term Borrowings of such Class to be made
pursuant to this Section ratably.

                (e) Prior to any repayment of any Term Borrowings of either
Class hereunder, the Borrower shall select the Borrowing or Borrowings of the
applicable Class to be repaid and shall notify the Administrative Agent by
telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of such selection not later than 11:00 a.m.,
New York City time, three Business Days before the scheduled date of such
repayment; provided that each repayment of Term Borrowings of either Class shall
be applied to repay any outstanding ABR Term Borrowings of such Class before any
Eurodollar Term Borrowings of such Class. Each repayment of a Borrowing shall be
applied ratably to the Loans included in the repaid Borrowing. Repayments of
Term Borrowings shall be accompanied by accrued interest on the amount repaid.

                SECTION 2.10. Prepayment of Loans. (a) The Borrower shall have
the right at any time and from time to time to prepay any Borrowing in whole or
in part, subject to the requirements of this Section.

                (b) On any date that the total Revolving Exposures exceed
$10,000,000, in the event and on each occasion that the total Revolving
Exposures exceed the Borrowing Base then in effect, the Borrower shall prepay
Revolving Borrowings in an aggregate amount equal to such excess.

                (c) In the event and on each occasion that any Net Proceeds are
received by or on behalf of Holdings, the Borrower or any Subsidiary in respect
of any Prepayment Event, the Borrower shall, immediately after such Net Proceeds
are received apply an aggregate amount equal to such Net Proceeds (i) first, to
the prepayment in full of all outstanding Term Borrowings and (ii) second, to
the reduction of the Revolving Commitments. The Borrower will, in any event,
prepay Term Borrowings at such times and in such amounts as shall be necessary
in order to avoid any requirement under the Senior Subordinated Notes Documents
to offer to purchase any Senior Subordinated Notes.

                (d) In the event of any partial reduction of the Revolving
Commitments, then (i) at or prior to the date of




<PAGE>



                                                                              49




such reduction, the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and the
Lenders of the Revolving Exposure after giving effect thereto and (ii) if such
Revolving Exposure would exceed the Revolving Commitments after giving effect to
such reduction, then the Borrower shall, on the date of such reduction, repay or
prepay Revolving Borrowings in an amount sufficient to eliminate such excess.

                (e) Following the end of each fiscal year of the Borrower,
commencing with the fiscal year ending October 25, 1997, the Borrower shall
prepay Term Borrowings in an aggregate amount equal to 50% (or, in the case of
the fiscal year ending October 25, 1997, 12.5%) of Excess Cash Flow for such
fiscal year; provided that if the Senior Leverage Ratio as of the end of such
fiscal year is less than 2.10 to 1.00, no prepayment shall be required pursuant
to this paragraph in respect of such fiscal year. Each prepayment pursuant to
this paragraph shall be made on or before the date on which financial statements
are delivered pursuant to Section 5.01 with respect to the fiscal year for which
Excess Cash Flow is being calculated (and in any event within 90 days after the
end of such fiscal year).

                (f) Prior to any optional or mandatory prepayment of Borrowings
hereunder, the Borrower shall select the Borrowing or Borrowings to be prepaid
and shall specify such selection in the notice of such prepayment pursuant to
paragraph (g) of this Section; provided that each prepayment of Borrowings of
any Class shall be applied to prepay ABR Borrowings of such Class before any
other Borrowings of such Class. In the event of any optional or mandatory
prepayment of Term Borrowings made at a time when Term Borrowings of both
Classes remain outstanding, the Borrower shall select Term Borrowings to be
prepaid so that the aggregate amount of such prepayment is allocated between the
Tranche A Term Borrowings and Delayed Draw Acquisition Borrowings pro rata based
on the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Borrowings of each such Class.

                (g) The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent by
telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of any prepayment hereunder (i) in the case of
prepayment of a Eurodollar Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City
time, three Business Days before the date of prepayment or (ii) in the case of
prepayment of an ABR Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time,
one Business Day before the date of prepayment. Each such notice shall be
irrevocable and shall specify the prepayment date, the principal amount of each
Borrowing or portion thereof to be prepaid and, in the case of a mandatory
prepayment, a reasonably detailed calculation of the amount of such prepayment;
provided that,


<PAGE>


                                                                              50


if a notice of optional prepayment is given in connection with a conditional
notice of termination of the Revolving Commitments as contemplated by Section
2.07, then such notice of prepayment may be revoked if such notice of
termination is revoked in accordance with Section 2.07. Promptly following
receipt of any such notice, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of
the contents thereof. Each partial prepayment of any Borrowing shall be in an
amount that would be permitted in the case of an advance of a Borrowing of the
same Type as provided in Section 2.02, except as necessary to apply fully the
required amount of a mandatory prepayment. Each prepayment of a Borrowing shall
be applied ratably to the Loans included in the prepaid Borrowing. Prepayments
shall be accompanied by accrued interest to the extent required by Section 2.12.

         SECTION 2.11. Fees. (a) The Borrower agrees to pay to the
Administrative Agent for the account of each Revolving Lender a commitment fee,
which shall accrue at the Applicable Rate on the average daily unused amount of
the Revolving Commitment of such Lender during the period from and including the
Effective Date to but excluding the date on which such Revolving Commitment
terminates. Accrued commitment fees shall be payable in arrears on the last day
of March, June, September and December of each year and on the date on which the
Revolving Commitments terminate, commencing on the first such date to occur
after the Effective Date. All commitment fees shall be computed on the basis of
a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed
(including the first day but excluding the last day). For purposes of computing
commitment fees, a Revolving Commitment of a Lender shall be deemed to be used
to the extent of the outstanding Revolving Loans and LC Exposure of such Lender.

     (b) The Borrower agrees to pay (i) to the Administrative Agent for the
account of each Revolving Lender a participation fee with respect to its
participations in Letters of Credit, which shall accrue at the same Applicable
Rate as interest on Eurodollar Revolving Loans on the average daily amount of
such Lender's LC Exposure (excluding any portion thereof attributable to
unreimbursed LC Disbursements) during the period from and including the
Effective Date to but excluding the later of the date on which such Lender's
Revolving Commitment terminates and the date on which such Lender ceases to have
any LC Exposure, and (ii) to the Issuing Bank a fronting fee, which shall accrue
at 1/4 of 1% per annum on the average daily amount of the LC Exposure (excluding
any portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC




<PAGE>
                                                                              51



Disbursements) during the period from and including the Effective Date to but
excluding the later of the date of termination of the Revolving Commitments and
the date on which there ceases to be any LC Exposure, as well as the Issuing
Bank's standard fees (other than fronting fees, which shall be payable as
specified above) with respect to the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension
of any Letter of Credit or processing of drawings thereunder. Participation fees
and fronting fees accrued through and including the last day of March, June,
September and December of each year shall be payable on the third Business Day
following such last day, commencing on the first such date to occur after the
Effective Date; provided that all such fees shall be payable on the date on
which the Revolving Commitments terminate and any such fees accruing after the
date on which the Revolving Commitments terminate shall be payable on demand.
Any other fees payable to the Issuing Bank pursuant to this paragraph shall be
payable within 10 days after demand. All participation fees and fronting fees
shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for
the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the
last day).

         (c) The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for its own
account, fees payable in the amounts and at the times separately agreed upon
between the Borrower and the Administrative Agent.

         (d) All fees payable hereunder shall be paid on the dates due, in
immediately available funds, to the Administrative Agent (or to the Issuing
Bank, in the case of fees payable to it) for distribution, in the case of
commitment fees and participation fees, to the Lenders entitled thereto. Fees
paid shall not be refundable under any circumstances.

         SECTION 2.12. Interest. (a) The Loans comprising each ABR Borrowing
shall bear interest at the Alternate Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate.

         (b) The Loans comprising each Eurodollar Borrowing shall bear interest
at the Adjusted LIBO Rate for the Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing
plus the Applicable Rate.

         (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any principal of or interest on
any Loan or any fee or other amount payable by the Borrower hereunder is not
paid when due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise, such
overdue amount shall bear interest, after as




<PAGE>
                                                                              52



well as before judgment, at a rate per annum equal to (i) in the case of overdue
principal of any Loan, 2% plus the rate otherwise applicable to such Loan as
provided in the preceding paragraphs of this Section or (ii) in the case of any
other amount, 2% plus the rate applicable to ABR Revolving Loans as provided in
paragraph (a) of this Section.

         (d) Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears on each
Interest Payment Date for such Loan and, in the case of Revolving Loans, upon
termination of the Revolving Commitments; provided that (i) interest accrued
pursuant to paragraph (c) of this Section shall be payable on demand, (ii) in
the event of any repayment or prepayment of any Loan (other than a prepayment of
an ABR Revolving Loan prior to the end of the Revolving Availability Period),
accrued interest on the principal amount repaid or prepaid shall be payable on
the date of such repayment or prepayment and (iii) in the event of any
conversion of any Eurodollar Loan prior to the end of the current Interest
Period therefor, accrued interest on such Loan shall be payable on the effective
date of such conversion.

         (e) All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of
360 days, except that interest computed by reference to the Alternate Base Rate
at times when the Alternate Base Rate is based on the Prime Rate shall be
computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year), and in
each case shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the
first day but excluding the last day). The applicable Alternate Base Rate or
Adjusted LIBO Rate shall be determined by the Administrative Agent, and such
determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

         SECTION 2.13. Alternate Rate of Interest. If prior to the commencement
of any Interest Period for a Eurodollar Borrowing:

         (a) the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be
     conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means do not
     exist for ascertaining the Adjusted LIBO Rate for such Interest Period; or

         (b) the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders that
     the Adjusted LIBO Rate for such Interest Period will not adequately and
     fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders (or Lender) of making or




<PAGE>
                                                                              53



     maintaining their Loans (or its Loan) included in such Borrowing for such
     Interest Period;

then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Borrower and the
Lenders by telephone or telecopy as promptly as practicable thereafter and,
until the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower and the Lenders that the
circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any Interest
Election Request that requests the conversion of any Borrowing to, or
continuation of any Borrowing as, a Eurodollar Borrowing shall be ineffective
and (ii) if any Borrowing Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing, such
Borrowing shall be made as an ABR Borrowing.

         SECTION 2.14. Increased Costs. (a) If any Change in Law shall:

         (i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or
     similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of,
     or credit extended by, any Lender (except any such reserve requirement
     reflected in the Adjusted LIBO Rate) or the Issuing Bank; or

         (ii) impose on any Lender or the Issuing Bank or the London interbank
     market any other condition affecting this Agreement or Eurodollar Loans
     made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein;

and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such
Lender of making or maintaining any Eurodollar Loan (or of maintaining its
obligation to make any such Loan) or to increase the cost to such Lender or the
Issuing Bank of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit or
to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or the
Issuing Bank hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise), then the
Borrower will pay to such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such
additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank,
as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.

                (b) If any Lender or the Issuing Bank determines that any Change
in Law regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing
the rate of return on such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's capital or on the
capital of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding company, if any, as a
consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made by, or participations in
Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or




<PAGE>
                                                                              54



the Letters of Credit issued by the Issuing Bank, to a level below that which
such Lender or the Issuing Bank or such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding
company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into
consideration such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's policies and the policies of
such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding company with respect to capital
adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender or the
Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will
compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank or such Lender's or the Issuing
Bank's holding company for any such reduction suffered.

         (c) A certificate of a Lender or the Issuing Bank setting forth the
amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank or its
holding company, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of
this Section shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent
manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the
case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days
after receipt thereof.

         (d) Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or the Issuing Bank to
demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of
such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's right to demand such compensation; provided
that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender or the Issuing
Bank pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or reductions incurred
more than 180 days prior to the date that such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as
the case may be, notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such
increased costs or reductions and of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's
intention to claim compensation thereof or; provided further that, if the Change
in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then
the 180-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of
retroactive effect thereof.

         SECTION 2.15. Break Funding Payments. In the event of (a) the payment
of any principal of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of an
Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of
Default), (b) the conversion of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day
of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (c) the failure to borrow, convert,
continue or prepay any Revolving Loan or Term Loan on the date specified in any
notice delivered pursuant hereto (regardless of whether such notice may be
revoked under Section 2.10(g) and is revoked in accordance therewith), or (d)
the assignment




<PAGE>
                                                                              55



of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period
applicable thereto as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section
2.18, then, in any such event, the Borrower shall compensate each Lender for the
loss, cost and expense attributable to such event. In the case of a Eurodollar
Loan, such loss, cost or expense to any Lender shall be deemed to include an
amount determined by such Lender to be the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of
interest which would have accrued on the principal amount of such Loan had such
event not occurred, at the Adjusted LIBO Rate that would have been applicable to
such Loan, for the period from the date of such event to the last day of the
then current Interest Period therefor (or, in the case of a failure to borrow,
convert or continue, for the period that would have been the Interest Period for
such Loan), over (ii) the amount of interest which would accrue on such
principal amount for such period at the interest rate which such Lender would
bid were it to bid, at the commencement of such period, for dollar deposits of a
comparable amount and period from other banks in the eurodollar market. A
certificate of any Lender setting forth any amount or amounts that such Lender
is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section shall be delivered to the
Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay
such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after
receipt thereof.

         SECTION 2.16. Taxes. (a) Any and all payments by or on account of any
obligation of the Borrower hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall be
made free and clear of and without deduction for any Indemnified Taxes or Other
Taxes; provided that if the Borrower shall be required to deduct any Indemnified
Taxes or Other Taxes from such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be
increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including
deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the
Administrative Agent, Lender or Issuing Bank (as the case may be) receives an
amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made,
(ii) the Borrower shall make such deductions and (iii) the Borrower shall pay
the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance
with applicable law.

         (b) In addition, the Borrower shall pay any Other Taxes to the relevant
Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

         (c) The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, each Lender
and the Issuing Bank, within 10 days after written demand therefor, for the full




<PAGE>
                                                                              56



amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes paid by the Administrative Agent,
such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, on or with respect to any
payment by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower hereunder or under
any other Loan Document (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or
asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) and any
penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect
thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or
legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A
certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the
Borrower by a Lender or the Issuing Bank, or by the Administrative Agent on its
own behalf or on behalf of a Lender or the Issuing Bank, shall be conclusive
absent manifest error. If the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the Issuing
Bank (as the case may be) receives a refund of any Indemnified Taxes or Other
Taxes for which the Borrower has made a payment hereunder, it shall promptly
notify the Borrower thereof and shall promptly upon receipt repay such refund to
the Borrower, without interest and net of any expenses incurred; provided that
the Borrower, upon the request of the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the
Issuing Bank (as the case may be), agrees to return the amount of such refund
(plus any penalties, interest or other charges required to be paid) to the
Administrative Agent, such Lender or the Issuing Bank (as the case may be) in
the event the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the Issuing Bank (as the case
may be) is required to repay such refund to the relevant Governmental Authority.

         (d) As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or
Other Taxes by the Borrower to a Governmental Authority, the Borrower shall
deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a
receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of
the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably
satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.

         (e) Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or
reduction of withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which the
Borrower is located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with
respect to payments under this Agreement shall deliver to the Borrower (with a
copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable
law, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable
law or reasonably requested by the Borrower as will permit such payments to be
made without withholding or at a reduced rate.

         SECTION 2.17. Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of
Setoffs. (a) The Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it
hereunder or under any other Loan Document (whether of principal, interest, fees
or reimbursement of LC Disbursements, or of amounts payable under Section 2.14,
2.15 or 2.16, or otherwise) prior to 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the date
when due, in immediately available funds, without set-off or counterclaim. Any
amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the
Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding
Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments
shall be made to the Administrative Agent at its offices at 270 Park Avenue, New
York, New York, except payments to be made directly to the Issuing Bank as
expressly provided herein and except that payments pursuant to Sections 2.14,
2.15, 2.16 and 9.03 shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto and
payments pursuant to other Loan Documents shall be made to the Persons specified
therein. The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by
it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly
following receipt thereof. If any payment under any Loan Document shall be due
on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to
the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing
interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension.
All payments under each Loan Document shall be made in dollars.

         (b) If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to
the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, unreimbursed LC
Disbursements, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied
(i) first, towards payment of interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably
among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest
and fees then due to such parties, and (i) second, towards payment of principal
and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due hereunder, ratably among the parties
entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal and unreimbursed LC
Disbursements then due to such parties.

         (c) If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or
counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or
interest on any of its Revolving Loans, Term Loans or participations in LC
Disbursements resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion
of the aggregate amount of its Revolving Loans, Term Loans and participations
in LC Disbursements and accrued interest thereon than the




<PAGE>
                                                                              58



proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater
proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participation's in the
Revolving Loans, Term Loans and participation's in LC Disbursements of other
Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall
be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of
principal of and accrued interest on their respective Revolving Loans, Term
Loans and participations in LC Disbursements; provided that (i) if any such
participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise
thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase
price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the
provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made
by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this
Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the
assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or participations
in LC Disbursements to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower
or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this
paragraph shall apply). The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to
the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender
acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise
against the Borrower rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such
participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower
in the amount of such participation.

         (d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the
Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative
Agent for the account of the Lenders or the Issuing Bank hereunder that the
Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that
the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may,
in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the Issuing Bank,
as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in
fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the Issuing Bank, as the
case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on
demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or Issuing Bank with interest
thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to
it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the
greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the
Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank
compensation.

         (e) If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by
it pursuant to Section 2.04 (d) or (e), 2.05(b), 2.17(d) or 9.03 (c), then the
Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary
provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative
Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender's obligations under
such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.

         SECTION 2.18. Mitigation Obligations: Replacement of Lenders. (a) If
any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.14, or if the Borrower is
required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental
Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.16, then such
Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for
funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations
hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment
of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce
amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.14 or 2.16, as the case may be, in the
future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or
expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower
hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in
connection with any such designation or assignment.

         (b) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.14, or if the
Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any
Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.16,
or if any Lender defaults in its obligation to fund Loans hereunder, then the
Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the
Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without
recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in
Section 9.04), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to
an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another
Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); provided that (i) the Borrower
shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent (and,
if a Revolving Commitment is being assigned, the Issuing Bank), which consent
shall not unreasonably be withheld, (ii) such Lender shall have received payment
of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and participations
in LC Disbursements, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other
amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such
outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the
case of all other

                                                                              60



amounts) and (iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for
compensation under Section 2.14 or payments required to be made pursuant to
Section 2.16, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or
payments. A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and
delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or
otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment
and delegation cease to apply.


                                   ARTICLE III

                         Representations and Warranties

         Each of Holdings and the Borrower represents and warrants to the
Lenders that:

         SECTION 3.01. Organization; Powers. Each of Holdings, the Borrower and
its Subsidiaries is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under
the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, has all requisite power and
authority to carry on its business as now conducted and, except where the
failure to do so, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, is qualified to do business in,
and is in good standing in, every jurisdiction where such qualification is
required.

         SECTION 3.02. Authorization; Enforceability. The Transactions and
Restatement Transactions to be entered into by each Loan Party are within such
Loan Party's corporate powers and have been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate and, if required, stockholder action. This Agreement has been duly
executed and delivered by each of Holdings and the Borrower and constitutes, and
each other Loan Document to which any Loan Party is to be a party, when executed
and delivered by such Loan Party, will constitute, a legal, valid and binding
obligation of Holdings, the Borrower or such Loan Party (as the case may be),
enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other laws affecting creditors' rights
generally and subject to general principles of equity, regardless of whether
considered in a proceeding in equity or at law.

         SECTION 3.03. Governmental Approvals; No Conflicts. The Transactions
and Restatement Transactions (a) do not require any consent or approval of,
registration or filing with, or any other action by, any Governmental




<PAGE>
                                                                              61



Authority, except such as have been obtained or made and are in full force and
effect and except filings necessary to perfect Liens created under the Loan
Documents, (b) will not violate any applicable law or regulation or the charter,
bylaws or other organizational documents of Holdings, the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries or any order of any Governmental Authority, (c) will not violate or
result in a default under any indenture, agreement or other instrument binding
upon Holdings, the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or its assets, or give
rise to a right thereunder to require any payment to be made by Holdings, the
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, and (d) will not result in the creation or
imposition of any Lien on any asset of Holdings, the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries, except Liens created under the Loan Documents.

         SECTION 3.04. Financial Condition; No Material Adverse Change. (a) The
Borrower has heretofore furnished to the Lenders its consolidated balance sheet
and statements of income, stockholders equity and cash flows (i) as of and for
the fiscal year ended October 27, 2001, reported on by Deloitte & Touche LLP,
independent public accountants, and (ii) as of and for the fiscal quarter and
the portion of the fiscal year ended July 27, 2002, certified by its chief
financial officer. Such financial statements present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position and results of operations and cash flows of the
Borrower and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of such dates and for such periods
in accordance with GAAP, subject to year-end audit adjustments and the absence
of footnotes in the case of the statements referred to in clause (ii) above.

         (b) The Borrower has heretofore furnished to the Lenders its pro forma
consolidated balance sheet as of August 2, 1997, prepared giving effect to the
Transactions as if the Transactions had occurred on such date. Such pro forma
consolidated balance sheet (i) has been prepared in good faith based on the same
assumptions used to prepare the pro forma financial statements included in the
information package distributed to the Lenders in August 1997 (which assumptions
are believed by the Borrower to be reasonable), (ii) is based on the best
information available to the Borrower after due inquiry, (iii) accurately
reflects all adjustments necessary to give effect to the Transactions and (iv)
presents fairly, in all material respects, the pro forma financial position of
the Borrower and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of August 2, 1997 as if the
Transactions had occurred on such date.

         (c) Except as disclosed in the financial statements referred to above
or the notes thereto or in the




<PAGE>
                                                                              62



Information Memorandum and except for the Disclosed Matters, after giving effect
to the Transactions and Restatement Transactions, none of Holdings, the Borrower
or its Subsidiaries has, as of the Restatement Effective Date, any material
contingent liabilities, unusual long-term commitments or unrealized losses.

         (d) Since October 27, 2001, there has been no material adverse change
in the business, assets, operations, prospects or condition, financial or
otherwise, of Holdings, the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

         SECTION 3.05. Properties. (a) Each of Holdings, the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries has good title to, or valid leasehold interests in, all its real
and personal property material to its business, except for minor defects in
title that do not interfere with its ability to conduct its business as
currently conducted or to utilize such properties for their intended purposes.

         (b) Each of Holdings, the Borrower and its Subsidiaries owns, or is
licensed to use, all trademarks, tradenames, copyrights, patents and other
intellectual property material to its business, and the use thereof by Holdings,
the Borrower and its Subsidiaries does not infringe upon the rights of any other
Person, except for any such infringements that, individually or in the
aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect.

         (c) Schedule 3.05 sets forth the address of each real property that is
owned or leased by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries as of the Restatement
Effective Date after giving effect to the Restatement Transactions. As of the
Restatement Effective Date, after giving effect to the Restatement Transactions,
neither Holdings, the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries owns any real
property other than the real property set forth in Schedule 3.05.

         SECTION 3.06. Litigation and Environmental Matters. (a) There are no
actions, suits or proceedings by or before any arbitrator or Governmental
Authority pending against or, to the knowledge of Holdings or the Borrower,
threatened against or affecting Holdings, the Borrower, any of its Subsidiaries
or the ESOP (i) as to which there is a reasonable possibility of an adverse
determination and that, if adversely determined, could reasonably be expected,
individually or in the aggregate, to result in a Material Adverse Effect, (ii)
that involve any of the Loan Documents or the Transactions or (iii) in the case
of the ESOP, as




<PAGE>
                                                                              63



which there is a reasonable possibility of an adverse decision that could
adversely effect the status of the ESOP.

         (b) Except for the Disclosed Matters and except with respect to any
other matters that, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, neither Holdings, the Borrower
nor any of its Subsidiaries (i) has failed to comply with any Environmental Law
or to obtain, maintain or comply with any permit, license or other approval
required under any Environmental Law, (ii) has become subject to any
Environmental Liability, (iii) has received notice of any claim with respect to
any Environmental Liability or (iv) knows of any basis for any Environmental
Liability.

         (c) Since the date of this Agreement, there has been no change in the
status of the Disclosed Matters that, individually or in the aggregate, has
resulted in, or materially increased the likelihood of, a Material Adverse
Effect.

         SECTION 3.07. Compliance with Laws and Agreements. Each of Holdings,
the Borrower and its Subsidiaries is in compliance with all laws, regulations
and orders of any Governmental Authority applicable to it or its property and
all indentures, agreements and other instruments binding upon it or its
property, except where the failure to do so, individually or in the aggregate,
could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. No
Default has occurred and is continuing.

         SECTION 3.08. Investment and Holding Company Status. Neither Holdings,
the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is (a) an "investment company" as
defined in, or subject to regulation under, the Investment Company Act of 1940
or (b) a "holding company" as defined in, or subject to regulation under, the
Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935.

         SECTION 3.09. Taxes. Each of Holdings, the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries has timely filed or caused to be filed all income, franchise and
other material Tax returns and reports required to have been filed and has paid
or caused to be paid all Taxes required to have been paid by it, except Taxes
that are being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and for which
Holdings, the Borrower or such Subsidiary, as applicable, has set aside on its
books adequate reserves; provided, that no representation or warranty can be
made with respect to J.C. Carter prior to the Acquisition, other than that the
sellers of J.C. Carter




<PAGE>
                                                                              64



have indemnified the Borrower for any such failure to file or pay taxes prior to
the Acquisition.

         SECTION 3.10. ERISA. No ERISA Event has occurred or is reasonably
expected to occur that, when taken together with all other such ERISA Events for
which liability is reasonably expected to occur, could reasonably be expected to
result in a Material Adverse Effect. The present value of all accumulated
benefit obligations under each Plan (based on the assumptions used for purposes
of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87) did not, as of the date
of the most recent financial statements reflecting such amounts, exceed the fair
market value of all the assets of such Plan by an amount that could reasonably
be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to result in a Material Adverse
Effect. Each Plan is in compliance in all material respects with the
requirements under ERISA and the Code.

         SECTION 3.11. Disclosure. The Borrower has disclosed to the Lenders all
agreements, instruments and corporate or other restrictions to which Holdings,
the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries is subject, and all other matters known
to any of them, that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Information
Memorandum nor any of the other reports, financial statements, certificates or
other information furnished by or on behalf of any Loan Party to the
Administrative Agent or any Lender in connection with the negotiation of this
Agreement or any other Loan Document or delivered hereunder or thereunder (as
modified or supplemented by other information so furnished) contains any
material misstatement of fact or omits to state any material fact necessary to
make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading; provided that, with respect to projected financial
information, Holdings and the Borrower represent only that such information was
prepared in good faith based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable at the
time.

         SECTION 3.12. Subsidiaries. Holdings do not have any Subsidiaries other
than the Borrower and the Borrower's Subsidiaries. Schedule 3.12 sets forth the
name and jurisdiction of organization of, and the ownership interest of the
Borrower in, each Subsidiary of the Borrower and identifies each Subsidiary that
is a Subsidiary Loan Party, in each case as of the Restatement Effective Date.

         SECTION 3.13. Insurance. Schedule 3.13 sets forth a description of all
insurance maintained by or on behalf of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries as of
the




<PAGE>
                                                                              65



Restatement Effective Date. As of the Restatement Effective Date, all premiums
in respect of such insurance have been paid.

         SECTION 3.14. Labor Matters. As of the Restatement Effective Date,
there are no strikes, lockouts or slowdowns against Holdings, the Borrower or
any Subsidiary pending or, to the knowledge of Holdings or the Borrower,
threatened. The hours worked by and payments made to employees of Holdings, the
Borrower and the Subsidiaries have not been in violation of the Fair Labor
Standards Act or any other applicable Federal, state, local or foreign law
dealing with such matters, except where such violations, individually or in the
aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect. All material payments due from Holdings, the Borrower or any Subsidiary,
or for which any material claim may be made against Holdings, the Borrower or
any Subsidiary, on account of wages and employee health and welfare insurance
and other benefits, have been paid or accrued as a liability on the books of
Holdings, the Borrower or such Subsidiary. The consummation of the Transactions
will not give rise to any right of termination or right of renegotiations on the
part of any union under any collective bargaining agreement to which Holdings,
the Borrower or any Subsidiary is bound.

         SECTION 3.15. Solvency. Immediately after the consummation of the
Restatement Transactions to occur on the Restatement Effective Date and
immediately following the making of each Loan made on the Restatement Effective
Date and after giving effect to the application of the proceeds of such Loans
(and taking into consideration the rights and obligations of the Loan Parties
under the Indemnity, Subrogation and Contribution Agreement), (a) the fair value
of the assets of each Loan Party, at a fair valuation, will exceed its debts and
liabilities, subordinated, contingent or otherwise; (b) the present fair
saleable value of the property of each Loan Party will be greater than the
amount that will be required to pay the probable liability of its debts and
other liabilities, subordinated, contingent or otherwise, as such debts and
other liabilities become absolute and matured; (c) each Loan Party will be able
to pay its debts and liabilities, subordinated, contingent or otherwise, as such
debts and liabilities become absolute and matured; and (d) each Loan Party will
not have unreasonably small capital with which to conduct the business in which
it is engaged as such business is now conducted and is proposed to be conducted
following the Restatement Effective Date.

         SECTION 3.16. Security Documents. (a) The Pledge Agreement is effective
to create in favor of the




<PAGE>
                                                                              66



Collateral Agent, for the ratable benefit of the Secured Parties, a legal, valid
and enforceable security interest in the Collateral (as defined in the Pledge
Agreement) and, when the Collateral is delivered to the Collateral Agent, the
Pledge Agreement shall constitute a fully perfected first priority Lien on, and
security interest in, all right, title and interest of each pledgor thereunder
in such Collateral, in each case prior and superior in right to any other
Person.

         (b) The Security Agreement is effective to create in favor of the
Collateral Agent, for the ratable benefit of the Secured Parties, a legal, valid
and enforceable security interest in the Collateral (as defined in the Security
Agreement) and, when financing statements in appropriate form are filed in the
offices specified on Schedule 6 to the Perfection Certificate, the Security
Agreement shall constitute a fully perfected Lien on, and security interest in,
all right, title and interest of the grantors thereunder in such Collateral
(other than the Intellectual Property (as defined in the Security Agreement), in
each case prior and superior in right to any other Person, other than with
respect to Liens expressly permitted by Section 6.02.

         (c) When the Security Agreement is filed in the United States Patent
and Trademark Office and the United States Copyright Office, the Security
Agreement shall constitute a fully perfected Lien on, and security interest in,
all right, title and interest of the Loan Parties in the Intellectual Property
(as defined in the Security Agreement) in which a security interest may be
perfected by filing, recording or registering a security agreement, financing
statement or analogous document in the United States Patent and Trademark Office
or the United States Copyright Office, as applicable, in each case prior and
superior in right to any other Person other than Liens expressly permitted by
Section 6.02 (it being understood that subsequent recordings in the United
States Patent and Trademark Office and the United States Copyright Office may be
necessary to perfect a Lien on registered trademarks, trademark applications and
copyrights acquired by the Loan Parties after the date hereof).

         SECTION 3.17. Federal Reserve Regulations. (a) Neither Holdings, the
Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is engaged principally, or as one of its
important activities, in the business of extending credit for the purpose of
buying or carrying Margin Stock.

         (b) No part of the proceeds of any Loan or any Letter of Credit will be
used, whether directly or indirectly, and




<PAGE>
                                                                              67



whether immediately, incidentally or ultimately, for any purpose that entails a
violation of, or that is inconsistent with, the provisions of the Regulations of
the Board, including Regulation G, U or K.

         SECTION 3.18. TRW Agreement. The provisions of the TRW Agreement
pursuant to which TRW is obligated to perform any "Environmental Remediation"
and/or indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Borrower, with respect to
"Excluded Environmental Obligations", TRW's share of "Shared Environmental
Obligations", or otherwise with respect to "Environmental Activities", are in
full force and effect in accordance with the terms of the TRW Agreement and no
party has waived any material rights thereunder. Terms contained in quotation
marks in this Section 3.18 shall have the respective meanings ascribed to such
terms in the TRW Agreement.

         SECTION 3.19. Tax Status of ESOP. The ESOP, together with the ESOP Plan
and Trust Document, complies with all the requirements necessary to be an
"employee stock ownership plan" within the meaning of Section 4975(e) (7) of the
Code. The ESOP is a qualified plan and trust under Section 401(a) of the Code,
exempt from the tax under Section 501 of the Code and in compliance with all
applicable requirements of the Code and ERISA.

         SECTION 3.20. Certain Agreements. The Stockholders' Agreement and the
Distributorship Agreement are in full force and effect.


                                   ARTICLE IV

                                   Conditions

         SECTION 4.01. Each Credit Event. The obligation of each Lender to make
a Loan on the occasion of any Borrowing, and of the Issuing Bank to issue,
amend, renew or extend any Letter of Credit, is subject to the satisfaction of
the following conditions:

         (a) The representations and warranties of each Loan Party set forth in
     the Loan Documents shall be true and correct on and as of the date of such
     Borrowing or the date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of such
     Letter of Credit, as applicable.

         (b) At the time of and immediately after giving effect to such
     Borrowing or the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of such Letter
     of Credit, as




<PAGE>
                                                                              68



     applicable, no Default shall have occurred and be continuing.

         (c) In the case of any Borrowing of a Revolving Loan or issuance of any
     Letter of Credit, at the time of and immediately after giving effect to
     such Borrowing or issuance of Letter of Credit, if the total Revolving
     Exposures exceed $10,000,000, the Borrower shall have delivered a Borrowing
     Base Certificate as of the most recent month that ended more than 15 days
     prior to such date of Borrowing or issuance of Letter of Credit.

Each Borrowing and each issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of a Letter of
Credit shall be deemed to constitute a representation and warranty by Holdings
and the Borrower on the date thereof as to the matters specified in paragraphs
(a) and (b) of this Section.


                                    ARTICLE V

                              Affirmative Covenants

         Until the Commitments have expired or been terminated and the principal
of and interest on each Loan and all fees payable hereunder shall have been paid
in full and all Letters of Credit shall have expired or terminated and all LC
Disbursements shall have been reimbursed, each of Holdings and the Borrower
covenants and agrees with the Lenders that:

         SECTION 5.01. Financial Statements and Other Information. The Borrower
will furnish to the Administrative Agent and each Lender (directly or through
the Administrative Agent):

     consolidated balance sheet and related statements of operations,
     stockholders' equity and cash flows as of the end of and for such year,
     setting forth in each case in comparative form the figures for the previous
     fiscal year, all reported on by Deloitte & Touche LLP or other independent

        statements present fairly in all material respects the financial
        condition and results of operations of the Borrower and its consolidated
        Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis in accordance with GAAP

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                            The Administrative Agent

                  Each of the Lenders and the Issuing Bank hereby irrevocably
appoints the Administrative Agent (which term for purposes of this Article shall
be deemed to refer to the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent) as its
agent and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such actions on its behalf
and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the
terms of the Loan Documents, together with such actions and powers as are
reasonably incidental thereto.

                  The bank serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall
have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender
and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and
such bank and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to and
generally engage in any kind of business with Holdings, the Borrower or any
Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if it were not the Administrative Agent
hereunder.

                  The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or
obligations except those expressly set forth in the Loan Documents. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, (a) the Administrative Agent shall not
be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a
Default has occurred and is continuing, (b) the Administrative Agent shall not
have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary
powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated by the
Loan Documents that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise in writing
by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders



<PAGE>
                                                                              96


as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided in Section 9.02), and
(c) except as expressly set forth in the Loan Documents, the Administrative
Agent shall not have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the
failure to disclose, any information relating to Holdings, the Borrower or any
of its Subsidiaries that is communicated to or obtained by the bank serving as
Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity. The
Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it
with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number
or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as
provided in Section 9.02) or in the absence of its own gross negligence or
wilful misconduct. The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have
knowledge of any Default unless and until written notice thereof is given to the
Administrative Agent by Holdings, the Subsidiaries, the Borrower or a Lender,
and the Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to
ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in
or in connection with any Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate,
report or other document delivered thereunder or in connection therewith, (iii)
the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms
or conditions set forth in any Loan Document, (iv) the validity, enforceability,
effectiveness or genuineness of any Loan Document or any other agreement,
instrument or document, or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in
Article IV or elsewhere in any Loan Document, other than to confirm receipt of
items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent.

                  The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and
shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request,
certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing believed
by it to be genuine and to have been signed or sent by the proper Person. The
Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by
telephone and believed by it to be made by the proper Person, and shall not
incur any liability for relying thereon. The Administrative Agent may consult
with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrower), independent
accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any
action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such
counsel, accountants or experts.

                  The Administrative Agent may perform any and all its duties
and exercise its rights and powers by or through any one or more sub-agents
appointed by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent and any such
sub-agent may

                                                                              97


perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers through their
respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of the preceding
paragraphs shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of each
Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective
activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided
for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent.

                  Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor the
Administrative Agent as provided in this paragraph, the Administrative Agent may
resign at any time by notifying the Lenders, the Issuing Bank and the Borrower.
Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, in
consultation with the Borrower, to appoint a successor. If no successor shall
have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such
appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice
of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the
Lenders and the Issuing Bank, appoint a successor Administrative Agent that
shall be a bank with an office in New York, New York, or an Affiliate of any
such bank. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as Administrative Agent
hereunder by a successor, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with
all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative
Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties
and obligations hereunder. The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor
Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor
unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor. After the
Administrative Agent's resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article and
Section 9.03 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring
Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in
respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while it was
acting as Administrative Agent.

                  Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and
without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on
such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit
analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also
acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the
Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and
information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its
own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement,
any other Loan Document or

                                                                              99


Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender in exercising any right or power hereunder
or under any other Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall
any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or
discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights
and remedies of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Issuing Bank
and the Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents are cumulative and
are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No
waiver of any provision of any Loan Document or consent to any departure by any
Loan Party therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be
permitted by paragraph (b) of this Section, and then such waiver or consent
shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which
given. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan or
issuance of a Letter of Credit shall not be construed as a waiver of any
Default, regardless of whether the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent,
any Lender or the Issuing Bank may have had notice or knowledge of such Default
at the time.

                  (b) Neither this Agreement nor any other Loan Document nor any
provision hereof or thereof may be waived, amended or modified except, in the
case of this Agreement, pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing
entered into by Holdings, the Borrower and the Required Lenders or, in the case
of any other Loan Document, pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing
entered into by the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, as applicable,
and the Loan Party or Loan Parties that are parties thereto, in each case with
the consent of the Required Lenders; provided that no such agreement shall (i)
increase the Commitment of any Lender without the written consent of such
Lender, (ii) reduce the principal amount of any Loan or LC Disbursement or
reduce the rate of interest thereon, or reduce any fees payable hereunder,
without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby, (iii) postpone the
scheduled date of payment of the principal amount of any Loan or LC
Disbursement, or any interest thereon, or any fees payable hereunder, or reduce
the amount of, waive or excuse any such payment, or postpone the scheduled date
of expiration of any Commitment, without the written consent of each Lender
affected thereby, (iv) change Section 2.17(b) or (c) in a manner that would
alter the pro rata sharing of payments required thereby, without the written
consent of each Lender, (v) change any of the provisions of this Section or the
definition of "Required Lenders" or any other provision of any Loan Document
specifying the number or

percentage of Lenders (or Lenders of any Class) required to waive, amend or
modify any rights thereunder or make any determination or grant any consent
thereunder, without the written consent of each Lender (or each Lender of such
Class, as the case may be), (vi) release Holdings or any Subsidiary Loan Party
from its Guarantee under the Parent Guarantee Agreement or the Subsidiary
Guarantee Agreement, as applicable (except as expressly provided in the Parent
Guarantee Agreement or the Subsidiary Guarantee Agreement, as applicable), or
limit its liability in respect of such Guarantee, without the written consent of
each Lender, (vii) except in strict accordance with the express provisions
thereof, release all or any substantial part of the Collateral from the Liens of
the Security Documents, without the written consent of each Lender, or (viii)
change any provisions of any Loan Document in a manner that by its terms
adversely affects the rights in respect of payments due to Lenders holding Loans
of any Class differently than those holding Loans of any other Class, without
the written consent of Lenders holding a majority in interest of the outstanding
Loans and unused Commitments of each affected Class (in addition to any consents
required under the foregoing provisions of this Section); provided further that
(A) no such agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise affect the rights or
duties of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or the Issuing Bank
without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral
Agent or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, and (B) any waiver, amendment or
modification of this Agreement that by its terms affects the rights or duties
under this Agreement of the Revolving Lenders (but not the Tranche A Term Loan
Lenders and Delayed Draw Acquisition Loan Lenders), the Tranche A Term Loan
Lenders (but not the Revolving Lenders and Delayed Draw Acquisition Loan
Lenders) or the Delayed Draw Acquisition Loan Lenders (but not the Revolving
Lenders and Tranche A Term Loan Lenders) may be effected by an agreement or
agreements in writing entered into by Holdings, the Borrower and requisite
percentage in interest of the affected Class of Lenders.

                  SECTION 9.03. Expenses; Indemnity; Damage Waiver. (a) The
Borrower shall pay (i) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the
Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and their Affiliates, including the
reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of counsel for the Administrative
Agent and the Collateral Agent, in connection with the syndication of the credit
facilities provided for herein, the preparation and administration of the Loan
Documents or any amendments, modifications or waivers of the provisions thereof
(whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall be

                                                                             101


consummated), (ii) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Issuing
Bank in connection with the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of any
Letter of Credit or any demand for payment thereunder and (iii) all
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent, the Collateral
Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender, including the fees, charges and
disbursements of any counsel for the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent,
the Issuing Bank or any Lender, in connection with the enforcement or protection
of its rights in connection with the Loan Documents, including its rights under
this Section, or in connection with the Loans made or Letters of Credit issued
hereunder, including all such out-of-pocket expenses incurred during any
workout, restructuring or negotiations in respect of such Loans or Letters of
Credit.

                  (b) The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, the
Collateral Agent, the Issuing Bank and each Lender, and each Related Party of
any of the foregoing Persons (each such Person being called an "Indemnitee")
against, and hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims,
damages, liabilities and related expenses, including the fees, charges and
disbursements of any counsel for any Indemnitee, incurred by or asserted against
any Indemnitee arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of (i) the
execution or delivery of any Loan Document or any other agreement or instrument
contemplated hereby, the performance by the parties to the Loan Documents of
their respective obligations thereunder or the consummation of the Transactions
or any other transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) any Loan or Letter of Credit
or the use of the proceeds therefrom (including any refusal by the Issuing Bank
to honor a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit if the documents
presented in connection with such demand do not strictly comply with the terms
of such Letter of Credit), (iii) any actual or alleged presence or release of
Hazardous Materials on or from any Mortgaged Property or any other property
currently or formerly owned or operated by the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries, or any Environmental Liability related in any way to the Borrower
or any of its Subsidiaries, or (iv) any actual or prospective claim, litigation,
investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether based on
contract, tort or any other theory and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a
party thereto; provided that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be
available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or
related expenses resulted from the gross negligence or wilful misconduct of such
Indemnitee.

                  (c) To the extent that the Borrower fails to pay any amount
required to be paid by it to the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or
the Issuing Bank under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section, each Lender
severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or the
Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such Lender's pro rata share (determined as of
the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is
sought) of such unpaid amount; provided that the unreimbursed expense or
indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case may
be, was incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent, the Collateral
Agent or the Issuing Bank in its capacity as such. For purposes hereof, a
Lender's "pro rata share" shall be determined based upon its share of the sum of
the total Revolving Exposures, outstanding Term Loans and unused Commitments at
the time.

                  (d) To the extent permitted by applicable law, neither
Holdings nor the Borrower shall assert, and each hereby waives, any claim
against any Indemnitee, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect,
consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages)
arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement or any
agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the Transactions, any Loan or
Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds thereof.

                  (e) All amounts due under this Section shall be payable
promptly after written demand therefor.

                  SECTION 9.04. Successors and Assigns. (a) The provisions of
this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties
hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby (including
any Affiliate of the Issuing Bank that issues any Letter of Credit), except that
(i) the Borrower may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or
obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of each Lender (and any
attempted assignment or transfer by the Borrower without such consent shall be
null and void) and (ii) no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer its rights or
obligations hereunder except in accordance with this Section. Nothing in this
Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person
(other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns
permitted hereby (including any Affiliate of the Issuing Bank that issues any
Letter of Credit), Participants (to the extent provided in paragraph (c) of this
Section) and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Parties
of each of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral

Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or
claim under or by reason of this Agreement.

                  (b) (i) Subject to the conditions set forth in paragraph (b)
(ii) below, any Lender may assign to one or more assignees all or a portion of
its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of
its Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it) with the prior written
consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld) of:

                  (A) the Borrower; provided that no consent of the Borrower
         shall be required for an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a
         Lender, an Approved Fund (as defined below) or, if an Event of Default
         under paragraph (a), (b), (h) or (i) of Article VII has occurred and is
         continuing, any other assignee; and

                  (B) the Administrative Agent; provided that no consent of the
         Administrative Agent shall be required for an assignment of any
         Revolving Commitment to an assignee that is a Lender with a Revolving
         Commitment immediately prior to giving effect to such assignment.

                  (ii) Assignments shall be subject to the following additional
conditions:

                  (A) except in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an
         Affiliate of a Lender or an assignment of the entire remaining amount
         of the assigning Lender's Commitment or Loans of any Class, the amount
         of the Commitment or Loans of the assigning Lender subject to each such
         assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and Acceptance
         with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative
         Agent) shall not be less than $3,000,000, unless each of the Borrower
         and the Administrative Agent otherwise consent; provided that no such
         consent of the Borrower shall be required if an Event of Default under
         paragraph (a), (b), (h) or (i) of Article VII has occurred and is
         continuing;

                  (B) each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of
         a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender's rights and
         obligations under this Agreement, provided that this clause shall not
         be construed to prohibit the assignment of a proportionate part of all
         the assigning Lender's rights and obligations in respect of one Class
         of Commitments or Loans;



<PAGE>
                                                                             104


                  (C) the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver
         to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Acceptance, together with
         a processing and recordation fee of $3,500;

                  (D) the assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver
         to the Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire; and

                  (E) in the case of an assignment to a CLO (as defined below),
         the assigning Lender shall retain the sole right to approve any
         amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement,
         provided that the Assignment and Acceptance between such Lender and
         such CLO may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of
         such CLO, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described in
         the first proviso to Section 9.02(b) that affects such CLO.

                  For purposes of this Section 9.04(b), the terms "Approved
Fund" and "CLO" have the following meanings:

         "Approved Fund" means (a) a CLO and (b) with respect to any Lender that
         is a fund which invests in bank loans and similar extensions of credit,
         any other fund that invests in bank loans and similar extension of
         credit and is managed by the same investment advisor as such Lender or
         by an Affiliate of such investment advisor.

         "CLO" means any entity (whether a corporation, partnership, trust or
         otherwise) that is engaged in making, purchasing, holding or otherwise
         investing in bank loans and similar extensions of credit in the
         ordinary course of its business and is administered or managed by a
         Lender or an Affiliate of such Lender.

                  (iii) Subject to acceptance and recording thereof pursuant to
paragraph (b) (iv) of this Section, from and after the effective date specified
in each Assignment and Acceptance the assignee thereunder shall be a party
hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and
Acceptance, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement,
and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest
assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance, be released from its obligations
under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering
all of the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, such
Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the
benefits of Sections 2.14, 2.15, 2.16 and 9.03). Any assignment or transfer by a
Lender of rights

                                                                             105


or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this Section 9.04
shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a
participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with paragraph (c) of
this Section.

                  (iv) The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as an
agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices a copy of each
Assignment and Acceptance delivered to it and a register for the recordation of
the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitment of, and principal
amount of the Loans and LC Disbursements owing to, each Lender pursuant to the
terms hereof from time to time (the "Register"). The entries in the Register
shall be conclusive, and Holdings, the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the
Issuing Bank and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the
Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of
this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be
available for inspection by the Borrower, the Issuing Bank and any Lender, at
any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

                  (v) Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and
Acceptance executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, the assignee's
completed Administrative Questionnaire (unless the assignee shall already be a
Lender hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to in paragraph
(b) of this Section and any written consent to such assignment required by
paragraph (b) of this Section, the Administrative Agent shall accept such
Assignment and Acceptance and record the information contained therein in the
Register. No assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless
it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this paragraph.

                  (e) Any Lender may, without the consent of the Borrower, the
Administrative Agent or the Issuing Bank sell participations to one or more
banks or other entities (a "Participant") in all or a portion of such Lender's
rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its
Commitment and the Loans owing to it); Provided that (i) such Lender's
obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall
remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of
such obligations and (iii) Holdings, the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the
Collateral Agent, the Issuing Bank and the other Lenders shall continue to deal
solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and
obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which
a Lender sells

                                                                             106


such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right
to enforce the Loan Documents and to approve any amendment, modification or
waiver of any provision of the Loan Documents; provided that such agreement or
instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the
Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described in the
first proviso to Section 9.02(b) that affects such Participant. Subject to
paragraph (c) (ii) of this Section, the Borrower agrees that each Participant
shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.14, 2.15 and 2.16 to the same
extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment
pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section. To the extent permitted by law, each
Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 9.08 as though it
were a Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.17(c)
as though it were a Lender.

                  (f) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater
payment under Section 2.14 or 2.16 than the applicable Lender would have been
entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant,
unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the
Borrower's prior written consent. A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender
if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.16 unless
the Borrower is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such
Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower, to comply with Section
2.16(e) as though it were a Lender.

                  (g) Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security
interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure
obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure
obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section shall not apply to any
such pledge or assignment of a security interest; provided that no such pledge
or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its
obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender
as a party hereto.

                  SECTION 9.05. Survival. All covenants, agreements,
representations and warranties made by the Loan Parties in the Loan Documents
and in the certificates or other instruments delivered in connection with or
pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be considered to
have been relied upon by the other parties hereto and shall survive the
execution and delivery of the Loan Documents and the making of any Loans and
issuance of any Letters of Credit, regardless of any investigation made



<PAGE>
                                                                             107


by any such other party or on its behalf and notwithstanding that the
Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender may have had notice or
knowledge of any Default or incorrect representation or warranty at the time any
credit is extended hereunder, and shall continue in full force and effect as
long as the principal of or any accrued interest on any Loan or any fee or any
other amount payable under this Agreement is outstanding and unpaid or any
Letter of Credit is outstanding and so long as the Commitments have not expired
or terminated. The provisions of Sections 2.14, 2.15, 2.16 and 9.03 and Article
VIII shall survive and remain in full force and effect regardless of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of the
Loans, the expiration or termination of the Letters of Credit and the
Commitments or the termination of this Agreement or any provision hereof.

                  SECTION 9.06. Counterparts: Integration: Effectiveness. This
Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto on
different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of
which when taken together shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement,
the other Loan Document and any separate letter agreements with respect to fees
payable to the Administrative Agent constitute the entire contract among the
parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous
agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter
hereof. Except as provided in Section 4.01, this Agreement shall become
effective when it shall have been executed by the Administrative Agent and when
the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof that, when
taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties hereto, and
thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto
and their respective successors and assigns. Delivery of an executed counterpart
of a signature page of this Agreement by telecopy shall be effective as delivery
of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.

                  SECTION 9.07. Severability. Any provision of this Agreement
held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to
such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality
or unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and enforceability
of the remaining provisions hereof; and the invalidity of a particular provision
in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other
jurisdiction.

                  SECTION 9.08. Right of Setoff. If an Event of Default shall
have occurred and be continuing, each Lender and each of its Affiliates is
hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, to set of f and apply any and all deposits (general or
special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other
obligations at any time owing by such Lender or Affiliate to or for the credit
or the account of the Borrower against any of and all the obligations of the
Borrower now or hereafter existing under this Agreement held by such Lender,
irrespective of whether or not such Lender shall have made any demand under this
Agreement and although such obligations may be unmatured. The rights of each
Lender under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies
(including other rights of setoff) that such Lender may have.

                  SECTION 9.09. Governing Law; Jurisdiction: Consent to Service
of Process. (a) This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with and
governed by the law of the State of New York.

                  (b) Each of Holdings and the Borrower hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the nonexclusive
jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the State of New York sitting in New York
County and of the United States District Court of the Southern District of New
York, and any appellate court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding
arising out of or relating to any Loan Document, or for recognition or
enforcement of any judgment, and each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably
and unconditionally agrees that all claims in respect of any such action or
proceeding may be heard and determined in such New York State or, to the extent
permitted by law, in such Federal court. Each of the parties hereto agrees that
a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by law. Nothing in this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall
affect any right that the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender
may otherwise have to bring any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement
or any other Loan Document against Holdings, the Borrower or its properties in
the courts of any jurisdiction.

                  (c) Each of Holdings and the Borrower hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do
so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of
any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to



<PAGE>
                                                                             109


this Agreement or any other Loan Document in any court referred to in paragraph
(b) of this Section. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to

charged, taken, received or reserved by the Lender holding such Loan in
accordance with applicable law, the rate of interest payable in respect of such
Loan hereunder, together with all Charges payable in respect thereof, shall be
limited to the Maximum Rate and, to the extent lawful, the interest and Charges
that would have been payable in respect of such Loan but were not payable as a
result of the operation of this Section shall be cumulated and the interest and
Charges payable to such Lender in respect of other Loans or periods shall be
increased (but not above the Maximum Rate therefor)
