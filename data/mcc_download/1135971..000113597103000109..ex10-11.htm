<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and of the mutual covenants and agreements of the parties set forth in this Agreement, and of other good and valuable consideration the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows:<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><U>1. Term of this Agreement</B></U>.<BR>

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the expiration of the three (3) year period of employment, this contract shall expire and the employment of Executive by the Company shall be subject to similar terms and conditions as other similarly situated key members of the Company's management team with similar levels of responsibility as Executive and, as such, shall continue on an at-will basis.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any obligations of the Company or the Executive hereunder which have not been satisfied as of the last day of the Term of this Agreement shall survive the expiration of the Term of this Agreement and shall remain in effect until such time as all such obligations have been satisfied. No additional payments are required by the termination of this Agreement.<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employment by an Affiliate of the Company or a successor to the Company will be considered employment by the Company for purposes of this Agreement, and the Executive's employment with the Company shall be considered terminated only if the Executive is no longer employed by the Company or any of its Affiliates or successors. The term "Company" as used in this Agreement will be deemed to include Affiliates and successors. For purposes of this Agreement, the term" Affiliate" means the subsidiaries of the Company and other entities under common control with the Company.

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Executive's Base Salary shall be reviewed at least annually during the term of this Agreement to ascertain whether, in the judgment of the Board or the Board's designee, such Base Salary should be increased, based primarily on the performance of the Executive during the year and the market pay for similarly situated professionals performing similar duties to the Executive.<BR>
