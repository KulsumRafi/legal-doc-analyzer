Addition Date therefor, together with all monies due or to become due with
respect thereto (including all Finance Charge Receivables), all Collections,
Recoveries and other proceeds thereof and Insurance Proceeds relating thereto.

     (b) In connection with such sale and conveyance, each RPA Seller shall, at
its own expense, on or prior to the SMT Termination Date (i) indicate or cause

                            -----------

     (e) If the arrangements with respect to the Receivables hereunder shall
constitute a loan and not a purchase and sale of such Receivables, it is the
intention of the parties hereto that this Agreement shall constitute a security
agreement under applicable law, and that each RPA Seller shall be deemed to have
granted to Buyer a first priority perfected security interest in all of such RPA

     Section 2.2 Addition of Additional Accounts. (a) If from time to time,
                 -------------------------------
Buyer becomes obligated to designate Additional Accounts pursuant to Section
                                                                     -------

then Buyer shall give RPA Sellers written notice thereof on or before the Notice
Date prior to the Addition Date therefor and RPA Sellers shall on or before the

Additional Accounts so that after the inclusion thereof Buyer will be in
compliance with the requirements of said Section 2.6(a). Additionally, subject
                                         --------------
to the limitations, if any, on Buyer's ability to add Additional Accounts under
Section 2.6(b) of the Transfer and Servicing Agreement, from time to time
--------------

the mutual agreement of Buyer and RPA Sellers. In either event, RPA Sellers
shall have responsibility for selecting the Additional Accounts and shall on or

delivered the list prior to termination shall not be deemed to render such
transfer executory or uncompleted.

     (c) At any time that Receivables in an Eligible Account are required to be
transferred to the Issuer pursuant to Section 2.6(e) of the Transfer and
                                      --------------
Servicing Agreement, such Eligible

identifying all such included Accounts so designated during the preceding
Monthly Period, by account number and the aggregate amount of the Receivables
and the aggregate amount of Principal Receivables in such included Accounts as
of such fifth Business Day.

     (d) On or before five Business Days after the first day of the Monthly
Period next succeeding the calendar month in which Accounts were included
pursuant to Section 2.2(c), FCNB (i) shall indicate or cause to be indicated in
            --------------
its books and records and in the computer files of the Receivables that the
Receivables created in connection with such included Accounts have been sold to
Buyer in accordance with this Agreement and transferred by Buyer to the Issuer
pursuant to the Transfer and Servicing Agreement and (ii) shall deliver or cause
to be delivered to Buyer a computer file or microfiche list containing a true
and complete list of all such included Accounts identified in the respective
Supplemental Conveyance, or, if Buyer shall so direct, such computer file or
microfiche list shall be delivered to the Owner Trustee pursuant to the Transfer
and Servicing Agreement.

     Section 2.3 Sellers of Receivables. The parties acknowledge and agree that
                 ----------------------
Eligible Receivables arising under Additional Accounts prior to the applicable
Addition Date may on each Addition Date be transferred to Buyer hereunder by
either RPA Seller, as the RPA Sellers may agree between themselves without the
necessity of any consent or approval of any other Person, but that in any event
Eligible Receivables arising under Additional Accounts on or after the
applicable Addition Date and which are to be transferred to Buyer hereunder
shall be so transferred by FCNB.

                                  ARTICLE III

                            CONSIDERATION AND PAYMENT

     Section 3.1 Purchase Price. Except as provided in Section 3.2, the Purchase
                 --------------                        -----------
Price for all Receivables (including Receivables in Additional Accounts)
conveyed to the Buyer under this Agreement shall be a dollar amount equal to the
total recorded unpaid balance of such Receivables (including Principal
Receivables and Finance Charge Receivables) on the date conveyed to Buyer
hereunder.

     Section 3.2 Payment of Purchase Price. The Purchase Price for Receivables
                 -------------------------
shall be paid or provided for on the SMT Termination Date, each Addition Date
and each Settlement Date, as the case may be, in either of the following ways
(or any combination thereof) as Buyer and the appropriate RPA Seller may
mutually agree from time to time: (i) by payment in cash in immediately
available funds; or (ii) by the sale, transfer, and assignment from Buyer to the
appropriate RPA Seller of an undivided participation in the Seller Interest,
entitling such seller to receive a portion of all payments made to the holder of
the Seller Interest in the proportion that the principal amount of the purchased
Receivables not paid for in cash as provided in clause (i)
                                                ----------

                                       4

above bears to the Principal Receivables evidenced by the Seller Interest. In
the absence of any agreement to the contrary, any portion of the Purchase Price
not paid in cash on the SMT Termination Date, any Addition Date (other than
Addition Dates arising under Section 2.2), or Settlement Date shall
                             -----------
automatically be deemed the purchase of a participation in the Seller Interest
in accordance with the terms of this Section 3.2 in an amount equal to the
                                     -----------
unpaid portion of the Purchase Price payable on such date, which participation
interest shall be evidenced by the Settlement Statement as provided in
Section 3.4.
-----------

     Section 3.3 Adjustments to Purchase Price. The Purchase Price payable to
                 -----------------------------
each RPA Seller shall be adjusted on a monthly basis to reflect any Credit
Adjustment.

     Section 3.4 Settlement. On each Determination Date under the Transfer and
                 ----------
Servicing Agreement (herein, a "Settlement Date"), FCNB shall deliver or cause
                                ----------------
to be delivered to Buyer a Settlement Statement in substantially the form of
Exhibit C, showing the aggregate amount of Receivables conveyed by each RPA
---------
Seller from the previous Settlement Date (or from the SMT Termination Date in
the case of the first Settlement Date) to such date, the amount of all payments
of the Purchase Price received by each RPA Seller prior to such Settlement Date
in respect of such Receivables, any Credit Adjustments to be made pursuant to
Section 3.4, and the settlements of the remaining Purchase Price for such
-----------
Receivables to be made as of such Settlement Date between Buyer and each RPA
Seller in accordance with Section 3.3. The balance due, if any, from Buyer to an
                          -----------
RPA Seller as reflected in immediately available funds, or, unless otherwise
agreed, shall automatically be deemed an assignment of an interest in the Seller
Interest in accordance with Section 3.3 in an amount equal to the unpaid portion
                            -----------
of the Purchase Price then due and payable, which participation shall be
evidenced by the Settlement Statement.

                                   ARTICLE IV

                       COVENANTS OF RPA SELLERS AND BUYER

     Section 5.1 RPA Seller Covenants. Each RPA Seller, but only as to itself
                 --------------------
and as to those Receivables, if any, transferred by it hereunder, hereby
severally (and not jointly) covenants and agrees with Buyer as follows:

     (a) Charge Account Agreements and Charge Account Guidelines. FCNB shall
         -------------------------------------------------------
comply with and perform its obligations under the Charge Account Guidelines,
except insofar as

                                       10

<PAGE>

any failure to so comply or conform would not materially and adversely affect
the rights of the Indenture Trustee and Noteholders under the Transfer and
Servicing Agreement or under the Notes. In that regard, except as aforesaid, and
so long as such changes are made applicable to comparable segments of the charge
accounts originated by FCNB which have characteristics the same as, or
substantially similar to, the Accounts pursuant to which the Receivables were
created, FCNB shall be free to change the terms and provisions of such Charge
Account Agreements or the Charge Account Guidelines in any respect (including
the calculation of the amount, the timing, or charge-offs), and shall notify the
Rating Agencies for changes that lower minimum payment terms, lower Finance
Charge rates, change terms from fixed- to floating-rate, and any changes to
delinquency and charge-off policies.

     (b) Finance Charges and Other Fees. Except (i) as otherwise required by any
         ------------------------------
Requirements of Law or (ii) as is consistent with the provisions of the Transfer
and Servicing Agreement and all Supplements thereto and as is deemed by FCNB to
be advisable for the charge account program based on a good faith assessment by
FCNB of the various factors impacting the use of FCNB charge accounts, FCNB
shall not reduce at any time (x) the Finance Charges assessed in respect of any
Accounts or (y) any other fees charged on any of the Accounts, if as a result of
any such reduction, FCNB's reasonable expectation of the Portfolio Yield as of
such date would be less than the highest of the Base Rates for the Notes then
outstanding.

     (c) Receivables Not to be Evidenced by Promissory Notes. FCNB will take no
         ---------------------------------------------------
action to cause any Receivable to be evidenced by any instrument.

     (d) Security Interests. Except for the conveyances hereunder, (i) such RPA
         ------------------
Seller will not sell, pledge, assign or transfer to any other Person, or grant,
create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any Lien on any Receivable, whether now
existing or hereafter created, or any interest therein; (ii) such RPA Seller
will immediately notify Buyer and the Indenture Trustee of the existence of any
Lien on any Receivable; and (iii) such RPA Seller shall defend the right, title,
and interest of Buyer and its successors and assigns in, to, and under the
Receivables, whether now existing or hereafter created, against all claims of
third parties claiming through or under such RPA Seller; provided, however, that
                                                         --------  -------
nothing in this Section 5.1(d) shall prevent or be deemed to prohibit such RPA
                --------------
Seller from suffering to exist upon any of the Accounts or Receivables any Liens
for municipal or other local taxes if such taxes shall not at the time be due
and payable or if such RPA Seller shall concurrently be contesting the validity
thereof in good faith by appropriate proceedings and shall have set aside on its
books adequate reserves with respect thereto.

     (e) Chief Executive Office; State of Organization. Each RPA Seller's chief
         ---------------------------------------------
executive office and state of organization is identified on Schedule 2. Neither
                                                            ----------
RPA Seller will relocate its chief executive office or state of organization,
unless such RPA Seller shall have given to Buyer not less than 15 days' written
notice of its intention to do so, clearly describing the new location or state
of organization. If as a result of such relocation, the applicable provisions of
the UCC or any other applicable law require the filing of any amendment to any
previously-filed financing or continuation statement or the filing of a new
financing statement, the appropriate RPA Seller shall file such financing
statement or amendment as may be necessary with respect to the transfer of
accounts (as defined in Section 9-102 of the UCC in effect in the State of
Illinois).

                                       11

<PAGE>

Additionally, FCNB shall clearly and unambiguously identify or cause to be
identified each Account (including any Additional Account designated pursuant to
Section 2.2) in its computer records relating to the Receivables, to reflect
-----------
that the Receivables arising in such Account have been sold to Buyer and
transferred by Buyer to the Issuer pursuant to the Transfer and Servicing
Agreement. Such RPA Seller shall, prior to the sale or transfer to a third party
of any receivable owned by such RPA Seller or held in its custody, examine its
books and records, including any computer records, to determine that such
receivable is not a Receivable.

     (f) Change of Name or Corporate Structure. Within 30 days after such RPA
         -------------------------------------
Seller makes any change in its name, identity, or corporate structure which
would make any financing statement or continuation statement filed in accordance
with Section 2.1 above seriously misleading within the meaning of Section 9-508
     -----------
of the UCC as in effect in the state where such financing statement or
continuation statement was filed, such RPA Seller shall file such financing
statements or amendments as may be necessary with respect to the transfer of
Accounts.

     (g) Further Assurances. Such RPA Seller will make, execute or endorse,
         ------------------
acknowledge, and file or deliver to Buyer from time to time such schedules,
confirmatory assignments, conveyances, transfer endorsements, powers of
attorney, certificates, reports and other assurances or instruments and take
such further steps relating to the Receivables and other rights covered by this
Agreement, as Buyer may request and reasonably require.

     (h) Indemnification. Such RPA Seller agrees to indemnify, defend and hold
         ---------------
Buyer harmless from and against any and all loss, liability, damage, judgment,
claim, deficiency, or expense (including interest, penalties, reasonable
attorneys' fees and amounts paid in settlement) to which Buyer may become
subject insofar as such loss, liability, damage, judgment, claim, deficiency, or
expense arises out of or is based upon (i) a breach by such RPA Seller of its
warranties and covenants contained in Section 4.1 (provided, however, with
                                      -----------  --------  -------
respect to the representations and warranties contained in Sections 4.1(1) and
                                                           ---------------
(m) above the indemnification provided for herein shall apply only to a breach
---
involving a material amount of Accounts or Receivables) or (ii) the
representations of such RPA Seller contained in Section 4.2, or any information
                                                -----------
certified in any Schedule delivered by such RPA Seller hereunder, being untrue
in any material respect at any time. The obligations of the RPA Sellers under
this Section 5.1(h) shall be considered to have been relied upon by Buyer and
     --------------
shall survive the execution, delivery, and performance of this Agreement
regardless of any investigation made by Buyer or on its behalf.

     (i) Municipal and Local Taxes. FCNB or the Servicer shall be responsible
         -------------------------
for collecting all state, local, and municipal taxes associated with the
Accounts and Receivables and for remitting the same to the appropriate
Governmental Authority, together with all tax returns, reports, or affidavits
required by such Governmental Authority in connection therewith.

     (j) Conveyance of Accounts. Such RPA Seller shall not convey, assign,
         ----------------------
exchange, or otherwise transfer the Accounts to any Person prior to termination
of this Agreement, and the Transfer and Servicing Agreement.

                                       12

<PAGE>

     (k) Non-Petition. Each RPA Seller hereby covenants and agrees that prior to
         ------------
the date which is one year and one day after the Scheduled Trust Termination
Date, it will not institute against, or join any other person in instituting
against, Buyer any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or
liquidation proceedings under any federal or state bankruptcy or similar law;
provided, however, that, while the Notes are outstanding, the agreement of the
--------  -------
RPA Sellers set forth in this sentence will terminate and be of no force and
effect if the absence of such agreement would not in and of itself result in the
lowering, suspension or withdrawal by Standard and Poor's, if such rating agency
then rates the Notes, or by Moody's, if such rating agency then rates the Notes,
of their respective ratings of the Notes. Nothing in this Section 5.1(1) shall
                                                          --------------
preclude, or be deemed to estop, either RPA Seller (a) from taking or omitting
to take any action prior to such date (i) in any case or proceeding voluntarily
filed or commenced by or on behalf of Buyer under or pursuant to any such law or
(ii) except for joining in the involuntary petition, in any involuntary case or
proceeding pertaining to Buyer which is filed or commenced by or on behalf of a
Person other than an RPA Seller (or any Person to which an RPA Seller shall have
assigned, transferred or otherwise conveyed any part of its obligations
hereunder) under or pursuant to any such law or (b) from commencing or
prosecuting any legal action which is not an involuntary case or proceeding
under or pursuant to any such law against Buyer or any of its properties.

     (l) Merger; Consolidation. FCNB shall not consolidate with or merge into
         ---------------------
any other Person or convey or transfer its properties and assets substantially
as an entirety to any Person, unless:

          (i) the Person formed by such consolidation or into which FCNB is
     merged or the Person which acquires by conveyance or transfer the
     properties and assets of FCNB substantially as an entirety shall be, if
     FCNB is not the surviving entity, organized and existing under the laws of
     the United States of America or any State or the District of Columbia, and
     shall be a national banking association, federal savings association, state
     banking corporation or state savings association which is not subject to
     the bankruptcy laws of the United States of America and shall expressly
     assume, by an agreement supplemental hereto, executed and delivered to the
     Buyer, in form satisfactory to the Buyer, the performance of every covenant
     and obligation of FCNB, as applicable hereunder, and shall benefit from all
     the rights granted to FCNB, as applicable hereunder. To the extent that any
     right, covenant or obligation of FCNB, as applicable hereunder, is
     inapplicable to the successor entity, such successor entity shall be
     subject to such covenant or obligation, or benefit from such right, as
     would apply to the extent practicable, to such successor entity;

          (ii) FCNB shall have delivered to the Buyer an Officer's Certificate

     such transaction have been complied with and, in the case of the Opinion of
     Counsel, that such supplemental agreement is legal, valid and binding with
     respect to FCNB; and

                         RECEIVABLES PURCHASE AGREEMENT

                     PERFECTION REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES
                                  AND COVENANTS

     (a) In addition to the representations, warranties and covenants contained
in the Receivables Purchase Agreement, each RPA Seller, but only as to itself
and as to those Receivables, if any, transferred by it under the Receivables
Purchase Agreement, hereby represents, warrants and covenants to Buyer as
follows as of October 17, 2001:

          (i) The Receivables Purchase Agreement creates either (A) a valid
     transfer to Buyer of all right, title and interest of RPA Seller in, to and
     under the Receivables conveyed to Buyer pursuant to Section 2.1 of the
     Receivables Purchase Agreement, and such property will be held by Buyer
     free and clear of any Lien, except for Liens permitted pursuant to
     paragraph (a) (iii) below, or (B) a valid and continuing security interest
     -------------------
     (as defined in the applicable Uniform Commercial Code) in the Receivables
     in favor of Buyer, which is enforceable with respect to existing
     Receivables in the Accounts on October 17, 2001, and, with respect to
     Receivables thereafter arising in the Accounts at the time such Receivables
     arise. If the Receivables Purchase Agreement constitutes the grant of a
     security interest to Buyer in the Receivables, such security interest is,
     and in the case of Receivables created after October 17, 2001, upon the
     creation thereof will be, prior to all other Liens (other than Liens
     permitted pursuant to paragraph (a) (iii) below).
                           -------------------

          (ii) The Receivables constitute "accounts" within the meaning of the
     applicable Uniform Commercial Code.

          (iii) Immediately prior to the conveyance of the Receivables pursuant
     to the Receivables Purchase Agreement, RPA Seller owns and has good and
     marketable title to, or has a valid security interest in, the Receivables
     free and clear of any Lien, claim or encumbrance of any Person; provided
                                                                     --------
     that nothing in this paragraph (a) (iii) shall prevent or be deemed to
                          -------------------
     prohibit RPA Seller from suffering to exist upon any of the Receivables any
     Liens for any taxes if such taxes shall not at the time be due and payable
     or if RPA Seller shall currently be contesting the validity thereof in good
     faith by appropriate proceedings and shall have set aside on its books
     adequate reserves with respect thereto.

          (iv) RPA Seller has caused the filing of all appropriate financing
     statements in the proper filing office in the appropriate jurisdictions
     under applicable law in order to perfect the security interest granted to
     Buyer under the Receivables Purchase Agreement in the Receivables arising
     in the Accounts.

          (v) Other than the transfer of the Receivables to Buyer pursuant to
     the Receivables Purchase Agreement, RPA Seller has not pledged, assigned,
     sold, granted a security interest in, or otherwise conveyed any of the
     Receivables. RPA Seller has not

<PAGE>

     authorized the filing of and is not aware of any financing statements
     against RPA Seller that include a description of collateral covering the
     Receivables, except for any financing statements or assignments filed
     pursuant to the Receivables Purchase Agreement or the Transfer and
     Servicing Agreement.

          (vi) RPA Seller is not aware of any judgment, ERISA or tax lien
     filings against Seller.

          (vii) Notwithstanding any other provision of the Receivables Purchase
     Agreement, the representations and warranties set forth in this Schedule 3
                                                                     ----------
     shall be continuing, and remain in full force and effect, until such time
     as all Notes have been finally and fully paid. Buyer shall not, without
     satisfying the Rating Agency Condition, waive a breach of any
     representation or warranty set forth in this Schedule 3.
                                                  ----------

     (b) RPA Seller and Servicer covenant that, in order to evidence the
interests of RPA Seller and Buyer under the Receivables Purchase Agreement, RPA
Seller and Servicer shall take such action, or execute and deliver such
instruments (other than effecting a Filing (as defined below), unless such
Filing is effected by Servicer in accordance with this paragraph (b)) as may be
necessary or advisable (including, without limitation, such actions as are
requested by Indenture Trustee) to maintain and perfect, as a first priority
interest, Buyer's security interest in the Receivables. Servicer shall, from
time to time and within the time limits established by law, prepare and present
to Indenture Trustee for Indenture Trustee to authorize (based in reliance on
the Opinion of Counsel hereinafter provided for) the Servicer to file, all
financing statements, amendments, continuations, initial financing statements in
lieu of a continuation statement, terminations, partial terminations, releases
or partial releases or any other filings necessary or advisable to continue,
maintain and perfect as a first-priority interest (each a "Filing"). The
                                                           ------
Servicer shall present each such Filing to the Indenture Trustee together with
(x) an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such Filing (i) is consistent with
the grant of the security interest to the Buyer pursuant to the Receivables
Purchase Agreement, (ii) satisfies all requirements and conditions to such
Filing in the Receivables Purchase Agreement and (iii) satisfies the
requirements for a Filing of such type under the Uniform Commercial Code in the
applicable jurisdiction (or if the Uniform Commercial Code does not apply, the
applicable statute governing the perfection of security interests), and (y) a
form of authorization for Indenture Trustee's signature. Upon receipt of such
Opinion of Counsel and form of authorization, Indenture Trustee shall promptly
authorize in writing Servicer to, and Servicer shall, effect such Filing under
the Uniform Commercial Code without the signature of RPA Seller or Buyer where
allowed by applicable law. Notwithstanding anything else in the Receivables
Purchase Agreement to the contrary, the Servicer shall not have any authority to
effect a Filing without obtaining written authorization from the Indenture
Trustee in accordance with this paragraph (b).
                                -------------

     (c) Notwithstanding paragraph (b) of this Schedule Three, the Indenture
Trustee hereby consents to, and no further authorization or approval from the
Indenture Trustee is necessary with respect to, the following Filings made in
connection with the execution of this Agreement:
