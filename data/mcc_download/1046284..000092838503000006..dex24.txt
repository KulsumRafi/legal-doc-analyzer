impairment of access of the Station to the Leased Transmitter Site or
discontinuation of necessary sewer, water, electrical, gas, telephone or other
utilities or services.

4.7.      Tangible Personal Property.

          Schedule 4.7 sets forth a list, complete and accurate in all material
respects, of the Purchased Assets which consist of tangible personal property.
All of such tangible personal property, viewed as a whole and not on an asset by
asset basis, are in good condition and working order, ordinary wear and tear

defects except such minor defects that do not interfere with the continued
present use thereof by Seller.

4.8.      FCC Licenses.

          Schedule 2.1.1 lists and accurately describes all of the FCC Licenses
necessary for the lawful ownership and operation of the Station and the conduct
of its business, except where the failure to hold any such FCC License would not
have a Material Adverse Effect. Seller has furnished to Purchaser true and
accurate copies of all of the FCC Licenses. Each such FCC License is in full
force and effect and is valid under applicable Laws; the Station is being
operated in compliance in all material respects with the Communications Act, and
all rules, regulations and policies of the FCC; and to the knowledge of Seller,
no event has occurred which (whether with or without notice, lapse of time or
the happening or occurrence of any other event) is reasonably likely to result
in the revocation or termination of any FCC License or the imposition of any
restriction of such a nature as would have a Material Adverse Effect, except for
proceedings of a legislative or rule-making

                                      -9-

nature intended to affect the broadcasting industry generally. The Station, each
of its physical facilities, electrical and mechanical systems and transmitting

with the specifications of the FCC Licenses. The FCC Licenses are unimpaired by
any act or omission of Seller or any of Seller's officers, directors or
employees and, Seller has fulfilled and performed all of Seller's material
obligations with respect to the FCC Licenses and has full power and authority
thereunder. Except as set forth on Schedule 2.1.1 with respect to the FCC
Modification Application and the FCC Morris Modification Application, no
application, action or proceeding is pending for the renewal or modification of
any of the FCC Licenses. No event has occurred which, individually or in the
aggregate, and with or without the giving of notice or the lapse of time or
both, would constitute grounds for revocation thereof.

4.9.      Reports.

          Seller has duly filed all reports required to be filed by any Law or
Order of any court or Governmental Authority and has made payment of all charges
and other payments, if any, shown by such reports to be due and payable, except
where the failure to so file or make payment would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect. All reports required to be filed by
Seller with the FCC with respect to the Station have been filed, except where
the failure to so file would not have a Material Adverse Effect. Such reports
and disclosures are complete and accurate in all material respects.

4.10.     Taxes.

Purchased Assets have been filed with the appropriate Governmental Authority,
and there have been paid all Taxes, penalties, interest, deficiencies,
assessments or other charges due with respect to such Taxes, as reflected on the
filed returns or claimed to be due by such federal, state or local taxing
authorities (other than Taxes, deficiencies, assessments or claims which are
being contested in good faith and which in the aggregate are not material).
Seller has not received any written notice of any examinations or audits pending
or unresolved examinations or audit issues with respect to Seller's federal,
state or local Tax returns that could adversely affect the Purchased Assets. All
additional Taxes, if any, assessed as a result of such examinations or audits
have been paid, and to Seller's knowledge, there are no pending claims or
proceedings relating to, or asserted for, Taxes, penalties, interest,
deficiencies or assessments against the Purchased Assets.

          4.11.1. Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect, with respect to the Purchased Assets, Seller is in compliance

          4.11.2. Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect, there are no pending or, to the knowledge of Seller, threatened

of responsibility, notice of potential responsibility, or information request
from any Governmental Authority arising out of or attributable to): (a) the
current or past presence at any part of the Leased Transmitter Site of Hazardous
Materials; (b) the current or past release or threatened release into the
environment from the Leased Transmitter Site (including into any storm drain,
sewer, septic system or publicly owned treatment works) of any Hazardous
Materials; (c) the off-site disposal of Hazardous Materials originating on or
from the Leased Transmitter Site; (d) any violation of Environmental Laws at any
part of the Leased Transmitter Site arising from Seller's activities involving

Adverse Effect, Seller has been duly issued all permits, licenses, certificates
and approvals required under any Environmental Law to operate the Purchased
Assets as they are currently operated.

          4.11.4. Seller has made available to Purchaser all environmental
assessments, reports, audits and other documents in Seller's possession or under
Seller's control that relate to the Leased Transmitter Site or Seller's
compliance with Environmental Laws with respect to the Purchased Assets.

          4.11.5. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, this
Section 4.11 sets forth Seller's exclusive representations and warranties with
respect to the environmental condition of the Purchased Assets, Seller's
compliance with Environmental Laws, Hazardous Materials, Environmental Laws or
other environmental matters. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, Purchaser hereby waives and releases all claims against Seller
arising under Environmental Laws, including any statutory rights to
contribution, with respect to the Purchased Assets.

4.12.     Litigation.

          There is no Order of any court or Governmental Authority and no
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, judicial, administrative or otherwise
that is pending or, to Seller's knowledge, threatened against or affecting the
Station which, if adversely determined would have a Material Adverse Effect or
which challenges the validity of any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

                  (d) no consent, approval, authorization, license, exemption

                        CERTAIN COVENANTS AND AGREEMENTS

6.1.      Regulatory Approvals.

          6.1.1.  No later than one (1) Business Day after the date hereof,
Seller and Purchaser shall jointly cause to be filed by Seller's FCC counsel an
application with the FCC requesting the FCC's consent to the assignment of the
FCC Licenses from BCR License Sub to Designated Licensee, which application is

associated with the FCC Assignment Application.

                                      -15-

<PAGE>

          6.1.2.  In addition to the FCC Assignment Application, Seller agrees
to use reasonable best efforts to file the FCC Modification Application within
three (3) Business Days after receipt thereof from Purchaser. The parties agree
that the FCC Modification Application will be prosecuted with reasonable best
efforts, in good faith and with due diligence. The parties agree to use their
reasonable best efforts to file additional information or amendments requested
by the FCC orally or in writing within five (5) Business Days after such request
and, in any event, to commence preparation of such additional information or
amendments immediately upon request and to complete and file the same with the
FCC as promptly as practical. Purchaser will be responsible for the expenses
incurred by the parties in the preparation, filing and prosecution of the FCC
Modification Application, including filing fees and legal and engineering
expenses. The parties acknowledge and agree that it shall not be a condition to
Closing that the FCC shall have approved the FCC Modification Application.

          6.1.3.  Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, Seller and Purchaser shall each use their respective reasonable best
efforts to promptly (a) take, or to cause to be taken, all actions, and to do,
or to cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in
doing all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law or
otherwise to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; (b) obtain from any Governmental Authority or other Person any
actions, non-actions, clearances, waivers, consents, approvals, permits or
Orders required to be obtained by Seller, Purchaser or any of their respective
Affiliates in connection with the authorization, execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement, the consummation of the other transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby and the assignment of the FCC Licenses from BCR
License Sub to Designated Licensee; (c) furnish all information required for any
application or other filing to be made pursuant to any applicable Law or any
applicable regulations of any Governmental Authority in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including filings in connection
with the FCC Assignment Application, and to supply promptly any additional
information and documentary material that may be requested in connection with
such filings or applications; (d) avoid the entry of, or have vacated or
terminated, any Order that would restrain, prevent or delay the Closing or the
FCC Order, including defending against and opposing any lawsuits or other
proceedings (including any FCC reconsideration or review), whether judicial or
administrative, reviewing or challenging this Agreement, the consummation of the
other transactions contemplated hereby and thereby or the assignment of the FCC
Licenses from BCR License Sub to Designated Licensee; and (e) execute and
deliver any additional instruments necessary to assign the FCC Licenses from BCR
License Sub to Designated Licensee or to consummate any other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. No party to this Agreement shall consent to any
voluntary delay of the assignment of the FCC Licenses from BCR

                                      -16-

<PAGE>

License Sub to Designated Licensee or the consummation of the other transactions
contemplated hereby at the behest of any Governmental Authority or other Person
without the consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. Without limiting this Section 6.1.3, Purchaser
agrees to take any and all steps and to make any and all undertakings necessary
to (i) avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any antitrust, merger
control, competition, or trade regulation Law, including the Communications Act,
that may be asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect to consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) resolve any
objection that may be asserted by the FCC or any other Person in order to obtain
promptly the FCC Order or satisfy or comply with any conditions imposed by the
FCC Order, in all events so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as
reasonably possible, including proposing, negotiating, committing to, and
effecting by consent decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the sale,
divestiture, licensing or disposition of such assets of Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates (including any FCC license held by such persons) or otherwise taking
or committing to take actions that limit Purchaser's or its Affiliates' freedom
of action with respect to, or their ability to retain, any of their assets, in
each case, as may be required in order to obtain the FCC Order or avoid the
entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining
order, or other Order in any suit or proceeding, which would otherwise have the
effect of preventing or delaying the Closing.

          6.1.4.  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if
the Closing occurs before the FCC Order becomes a Final Order, the terms of
Section 6.1.3 shall survive the Closing until the FCC Order becomes a Final
Order; provided, however, that such terms shall only survive as applied to
actions relating to the obtaining of the FCC Order and such FCC Order becoming a
Final Order. No assignment of the FCC Licenses shall occur prior to obtaining
the FCC Order.

6.2.      Third Party Consents and Notices.

          6.2.1.  Seller will use its reasonable best efforts to obtain all
Third Party Consents as promptly as practicable after the date of this
Agreement. All Third Party Consents shall be in form reasonably satisfactory to
Purchaser, and none shall provide for any increase in cost or other change in
terms and conditions after the Closing which would be adverse to Purchaser.

          6.2.2.  Prior to Closing, Seller shall provide written notice to third
parties which have entered into material contracts with the Station (other than
the Assumed Contract) regarding (a) the existence of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby and (b) that Purchaser is not assuming any
obligations of Seller or the Station in respect of the contracts with such third
parties. Seller shall promptly provide copies of these written notices to
Purchaser.

6.3.      Access to Information.

          From the date hereof until the Closing (upon reasonable notice to
Seller), during normal business hours, Seller shall, and shall cause its
officers, directors, employees, auditors and agents to, (a) afford the officers,
employees and authorized agents and representatives of Purchaser reasonable
access to the offices, properties, books and records of Seller to the extent
related to the Purchased Assets, and (b) furnish to the officers, employees and
authorized agents and representatives of Purchaser such additional information
regarding the Purchased Assets and the Station (including regularly prepared
financial statements of the Station) as Purchaser may from time to time
reasonably request in order to assist Purchaser in fulfilling its obligations
under this Agreement and Purchaser's reporting obligations under applicable
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and to
facilitate the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby; provided,
however, that (i) such investigation shall not unreasonably interfere with any
of the businesses or operations of Seller or the Station and (ii) it is
understood that Seller is not making any representations or warranties as to any
financial statements of the Station furnished to Purchaser.

6.4.      Confidentiality.

          The terms of the confidentiality agreement previously executed between
the parties (the "Confidentiality Agreement") between Seller and Purchaser are
hereby incorporated herein by reference and shall continue in full force and
effect until the Closing, at which time such Confidentiality Agreement and the
obligations of Purchaser under this Section 6.4 shall terminate; provided,
however, that the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate only in respect of
that portion of the Evaluation Material (as defined in the Confidentiality
Agreement) exclusively relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Purchased Assets. If this Agreement is, for any reason,
terminated prior to the Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement shall nonetheless
continue in full force and effect.

6.5.      Public Announcements.

          Seller and Purchaser shall consult with each other before issuing any
press release or otherwise making any public statements with respect to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated herein and shall not issue any such
press release or make any such public statement without the prior written
consent of the other party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed; provided, however, that a party may, without the prior
written consent of the other party, issue such press release or make such public
statement as may be required by Law or any listing agreement with a national
securities exchange to which Seller or Purchaser is a party if it has used all
reasonable efforts to consult with the other

                                      -18-

<PAGE>

party and to obtain such party's consent but has been unable to do so in a
timely manner.

6.6.      Ordinary Course of Business.

          During the period from the date hereof to the Closing Date, unless the
prior consent of Purchaser is first obtained, Seller shall cause the Station to
not knowingly take any action which would cause the conditions set forth in
Section 7.1 and Section 7.2 not to be satisfied as of the Closing Date.

6.7.      Control of the Station.

          Prior to the Closing, Purchaser shall not, directly or indirectly,
control, supervise, direct, or attempt to control, supervise, or direct, the
operations of the Station; such operations, including complete control and
supervision of the Station programs, employees, and policies, shall be the sole
responsibility of Seller until the Closing.

6.8.      Risk of Loss.

          Seller shall bear the risk of all damage to, loss of or destruction of
any of the Purchased Assets between the date of this Agreement and the Closing
Date. If any material portion of the Purchased Assets (other than items that are
obsolete and not necessary for the continued operations of the Station) shall
suffer any material damage or destruction prior to the Closing Date, Seller
shall promptly notify Purchaser in writing of such damage or destruction, shall
promptly take all necessary steps to restore, repair or replace such assets at
Seller's sole expense, and shall advise Purchaser in writing of the estimated
cost to complete such restoration, repair or replacement and all amounts
actually paid as of the date of the estimate. If necessary and provided that
Seller is diligently pursuing such restoration, repair or replacement, the
Closing Date shall be extended for a period up to the Outside Date to accomplish
such restoration, repair or replacement.

6.9.      Morris Station.

          Within a reasonable period of time after the date hereof, Seller
agrees to file, at Purchaser's sole cost and expense, an application with the
FCC proposing to modify the directional antenna for the Morris Station at
Seller's current transmitter site in Morris, Illinois, in accordance with the
engineering specifications set forth on Schedule 6.9 hereto (the "FCC Morris
Modification Application"). The parties acknowledge and agree that it shall not
be a condition to Closing that the FCC shall have approved the FCC Morris
Modification Application. Moreover, the parties acknowledge and agree that
Seller may sell and assign its rights in the Morris Station, and that Seller's
obligations pursuant to this Section 6.9 shall apply only so

                                      -19-

<PAGE>

long as Seller or a subsidiary of Seller is the licensee of both the Station and
the Morris Station. For so long as this Agreement remains in effect, Seller
covenants and agrees to cause any assignee of the FCC licenses for the Morris
Station to agree, for the direct benefit of Purchaser, to assume Seller's

          This Agreement may be terminated by the mutual written agreement of
Purchaser and Seller, or, if the terminating party is not then in material
breach of its obligations hereunder, upon written notice as follows:

          10.1.1. by Purchaser if Seller is in material breach of its
obligations hereunder, such that the conditions set forth in Section 7.1 and
Section 7.2 would not be satisfied as of the Closing, and such breach has not
been cured by Seller within thirty (30) days of written notice of such breach
(or such longer period of time if the breach cannot be reasonably cured within
thirty (30) days and Seller is diligently attempting to cure such breach);

          10.1.2. by Seller if Purchaser is in material breach of its
obligations hereunder, such that the conditions set forth in Section 8.1 and
Section 8.2 would not be satisfied as of the Closing, and such breach has not

at, and will have no further force and effect after, the Closing. No covenants

11.2.     Specific Performance.

contemplated hereby are unique, that a failure by Seller or Purchaser to
complete such transactions will cause irreparable injury to the other, and that
actual damages for any such failure may be difficult to ascertain and may be
inadequate. Consequently, Seller and Purchaser agree that each shall be
entitled, in the event of a default by the other, to specific performance of any
of the provisions of this Agreement in addition to any other legal or equitable
remedies to which the non-defaulting party may otherwise be entitled. In the
event any action is brought, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover
court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees.

          Purchaser agrees that it will, at any time, prior to, at or after the
Closing Date, take or cause to be taken such further actions, and execute,
deliver and file or cause to be executed, delivered and filed such further
documents and instruments and obtain such consents, as may be reasonably
requested by Seller in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Seller agrees that it will, at any time, prior
to, at or after the Closing Date, take or cause to be taken such further
actions, and execute, deliver and file or cause to be executed, delivered and
filed such further documents and instruments and obtain such consents, as may be
reasonably requested by Purchaser in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

11.4.     Fees and Expenses.

          Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, all fees and
expenses, including fees and expenses of counsel, financial advisors, and
accountants incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such fee or expense,

contemplated hereunder, whether levied on Purchaser or Seller, shall be borne by
Purchaser. Purchaser or Seller, as required by Law, shall file all necessary
documentation with respect to, and make all payments of, such taxes and fees on
a timely basis; provided that Purchaser shall remit any funds necessary to pay
such taxes and fees under this Section 11.5 in sufficient time to allow timely
payment of any such taxes and fees.
