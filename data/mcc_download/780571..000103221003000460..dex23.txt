               CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

3.1             EFFECT ON CAPITAL

         As of the  Effective  Time of the  Amalgamation,  by virtue of the
Amalgamation and without any action on the part of the Company, the Combination
Company, Itron or the holders of any of the following securities:

         (a)    CONVERSION OF COMBINATION COMPANY SHARES

         All shares of the Combination Company issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Amalgamation shall, in the
aggregate, be converted automatically into one common share of the Surviving
Corporation as of the Effective Time of the Amalgamation.

         (b)    CANCELLATION OF COMPANY TREASURY SHARES

         All shares of the Company held in the treasury of the Company and each
share of the Company owned by Itron immediately prior to the Effective Time of
the Amalgamation, if any, shall be cancelled and extinguished as of the
Effective Time of the Amalgamation, without any conversion thereof and no amount
or other consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor.

         (c)    CONVERSION OF COMPANY COMMON SHARES

                (i)    Each of the Company Common Shares issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Amalgamation, other than those
Company Common Shares that are cancelled as provided in Section 3.1(b) or for
which Dissent Rights are perfected, upon the surrender of the certificates
formerly representing such Company Common Shares pursuant to Section 3.2, shall
be converted automatically into one Surviving Corporation Preference Share at
the Effective Time.

                (ii)   Each Surviving Corporation Preference Share will on the

aggregate amount otherwise payable to Company Shareholders who have delivered
written notice of their intent to demand payment to the Company and have not

                (iv)   All such Company Common Shares shall automatically be

Effective Time of the Amalgamation shall cease to have any rights with respect
to such Company Common Shares, except the right to receive the Amalgamation

         (e)    DEPOSIT OF ADJUSTMENT ESCROWED FUNDS

         Notwithstanding the foregoing and the provisions of this Article III,

Adjustment Escrow Amount (as defined in Section 3.1(f) below) shall be deposited
in the Adjustment Escrow with Pacific Corporate Trust Company (the "Adjustment

Escrow Agreement, such Adjustment Escrow to be withheld and deducted, pro rata,
from the Amalgamation Consideration otherwise issuable to each Company
Shareholder at the Effective Time of the Amalgamation.

The Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet shall be prepared according to GAAP

projected statement of income in accordance with GAAP for the period ended at
the anticipated Effective Time of the Amalgamation (the "Preliminary Closing
Statement"). In addition, the Company shall provide a schedule reasonably
detailing the Company's estimate as of the projected Effective Time of the
Amalgamation of the net working capital adjustment

                                      -12-

<PAGE>

(the "Estimated Net Working Capital Adjustment") prepared in accordance with the
provisions set forth on Schedule 3.1(f) comparing the net working capital on the
Company's balance sheet as of March 31, 2002 with the anticipated balance sheet
at the Effective Time of the Amalgamation based on the Preliminary Closing
Balance Sheet (such form of comparison referred to in this Section 3.1 as a "Net
Working Capital Adjustment"). The Company shall consult with Itron during its
preparation of the Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet, the Preliminary Closing
Statement and the calculation of the Estimated Net Working Capital Adjustment.
Itron shall withhold from the Amalgamation Consideration otherwise payable to
the Company Shareholders the amount of Four Hundred Fifty Thousand American
Dollars (US $450,000) (the "Adjustment Escrow Amount"), and Itron shall deposit
such amount to the Adjustment Escrow provided for in Section 3.1(e) above.

                (ii)   As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time of
the Amalgamation, but in no event more than forty-five (45) days after the
Effective Time of the Amalgamation, Itron shall prepare a balance sheet and
income statement of the Company as of the Effective Time of the Amalgamation and
a schedule calculating the Net Working Capital Adjustment prepared in accordance
with the provisions set forth on Schedule 3.1(f) comparing the net working
capital on the Company's balance sheet as of March 31, 2002 with the balance
sheet at the Effective Time of the Amalgamation (the "Final Closing Statement")
and may engage Deloitte & Touche, LLP, or such other nationally recognized
accounting firm (the "Itron Accountants"), to conduct an audit of the Final
Closing Statement at Itron's sole cost. The Final Closing Statement shall be
prepared according to GAAP, consistent with the Company's past practices through
the Effective Time of the Amalgamation, which shall be applied to calculate the
final Net Working Capital Adjustment and shall be reflected in one or more
footnotes and supplemental schedules to such statements. A separate schedule
attached to the Final Closing Statement shall contain the calculation of the
final Net Working Capital Adjustment. The Final Closing Statement shall be
promptly delivered to the Shareholders' Representatives (as defined below), and
Itron and Shareholders' Representatives shall thereafter attempt to reach
agreement on the Final Closing Statement. If the Shareholders' Representatives
and Itron are unable to agree on the Final Closing Statement, then the
Shareholders' Representatives shall present any objections or comments in
writing to Itron no later than twenty (20) days after their receipt of the Final
Closing Statement, specifying in reasonable detail any objections thereto (the
"NWCA Dispute Notice"). During the foregoing period, and at their sole
discretion, the Shareholders' Representatives may cause a nationally recognized
accounting firm designated at their sole discretion (the "Shareholders'
Accountants") to review the written calculation of the Net Working Capital
Adjustment and the Final Closing Statement. The Shareholders' Representatives
shall have access to Itron's work papers used in the preparation of the Final
Closing Statement. If Itron and the Shareholders' Representatives are unable to
resolve informally matters raised by such comments or objections, the matter
shall be resolved by the Accounting Arbitrator(s) (as defined below) in
accordance with the process set forth in Section 3.1(f)(iii).

                (iii)  In the event that the Shareholders' Representatives
provide Itron with a timely NWCA Dispute Notice, then the Shareholders'
Representatives and Itron shall work together in good faith to reach an
agreement on any adjustments to the Final Closing Statement and the calculation
of the Net Working Capital Adjustment. If within twenty (20) Business Days after
Itron's receipt of the NWCA Dispute Notice, Itron and the Shareholders'
Representatives

                                      -13-

<PAGE>

have not reached an agreement, the parties shall engage the Accounting
Arbitrator to determine any adjustments to the Final Closing Statement and the
calculation of the Net Working Capital Adjustment. If the parties are unable to
agree upon one Accounting Arbitrator, each shall appoint an Accounting
Arbitrator and these appointees shall appoint a third Accounting Arbitrator
(collectively, the "Accounting Arbitrators"), in which case the determination of
the amount of any adjustments to the Final Closing Statement and the Net Working
Capital Adjustment shall be made by a majority decision of the Accounting
Arbitrators. The decision of the Accounting Arbitrator(s) shall be conclusive
and binding on all parties. The Accounting Arbitrator(s) shall be directed to
make a determination of any adjustment to the Final Closing Statement and the
calculation of the Net Working Capital Adjustment within forty-five (45) days of
engagement. Payment by Itron or the Shareholders, as applicable, of the
difference between the amount paid in connection with the Net Working Capital
Adjustment, if any, and the amount of the required payment as determined by the
Accounting Arbitrator(s) (the "NWCA Correction Amount") shall be due within ten
(10) days after the resolution of any such dispute. Itron and the Shareholders'
Representatives (on behalf of the Company Shareholders) shall pay the costs and
expenses of their own accountants and attorneys and shall bear equally the
expense of the Accounting Arbitrator(s) (such costs and expenses of the
Shareholders' Representatives shall be paid from the Amalgamation Consideration
held in the Adjustment Escrow); provided, however, that, (X) if the Accounting
Arbitrator(s) determine that the NWCA Correction Amount requires a payment by
Itron to the Company Shareholders of an additional amount that is at least ten
percent (10%) of the amount that was initially paid in connection with the Net
Working Capital Adjustment, then Itron shall pay all fees and expenses with
respect to the Itron Accountants, the Shareholders' Accountants and the
Accounting Arbitrator(s) as well as all reasonable attorneys' fees of the
parties, and (Y) if the Accounting Arbitrator(s) determine that the NWCA
Correction Amount requires a payment by the Company Shareholders to Itron that
is at least ten percent (10%) of the amount that was initially paid in
connection with the Net Working Capital Adjustment, then the Company
Shareholders shall pay (from the Amalgamation Consideration held in the
Adjustment Escrow) all fees and expenses with respect to the Itron Accountants,
the Shareholders' Accountants and the Accounting Arbitrator(s) as well as all
reasonable attorneys' fees of the parties.

                (iv)   To the extent that the Net Working Capital Adjustment as
finally determined in accordance with the provisions set forth in Section
3.1(f)(ii) above (a "Final NWCA Determination") is an increase of more than
CDN$1,500,000 over the net working capital of the Company as of March 31, 2002
(the excess being a "Final NWCA Increase"), then, within five (5) Business Days
after such Final NWCA Determination, Itron shall deposit with the Adjustment
Escrow Agent an amount of cash equal to such Final NWCA Increase, if any, (a
"Final NWCA Payment"). Within two (2) days after a Final NWCA Payment is
deposited in the Adjustment Escrow pursuant to this Section 3.1(f)(iv), such
Final NWCA Payment plus the Adjustment Escrow Amount shall be released from the
Adjustment Escrow to the former Company Shareholders in proportion to their
receipt of the Amalgamation Consideration in accordance with the Adjustment
Escrow Agreement.

                (v)    To the extent that a Final NWCA Determination results in
a Net Working Capital Adjustment that is a decrease of less than or equal to One
Million Five Hundred Thousand Canadian Dollars (CDN$1,500,000), then, within
five (5) Business Days following a Final NWCA Determination, the Adjustment
Escrow Amount shall be released from the

                                      -14-

<PAGE>

Adjustment Escrow to the former Company Shareholders in proportion to their
receipt of the Amalgamation Consideration in accordance with the Adjustment
Escrow Agreement.

                (vi)   To the extent that a Final NWCA Determination results in
a Net Working Capital Adjustment that is a decrease of more than One Million
Five Hundred Canadian Dollars (CDN$1,500,000) (such difference between the Final
NWCA Determination and CDN$1,500,000 being the "Final NWCA Decrease"), then
within five (5) business days following such Final NWCA Determination, Itron
may, pursuant to the Adjustment Escrow Agreement, instruct the Adjustment Escrow
Agent to transfer an amount of cash equal to such Final NWCA Decrease to Itron
in American funds based upon the Canadian Dollar to American Dollar noon spot
exchange rate in effect at the Bank of Canada on the business day before such
transfer. To the extent that any funds remain in the Adjustment Escrow following
such transfer to Itron, those remaining funds shall be promptly released to the
former Company Shareholders in proportion to their receipt of the Amalgamation
Consideration in accordance with the Adjustment Escrow Agreement.

                (vii)  The adjustments pursuant to the Net Working Capital
Adjustments in this Section 3.1(f) shall be treated as an increase or a decrease
in the Amalgamation Consideration.

3.2             EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

         (a)    Exchange Agent

         Prior to the Effective Time of the Amalgamation, Itron shall engage
Pacific Corporate Trust Company to act as exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent")

Accounts, then Itron shall cause the Company to transfer to Jones any

necessary registrations and filings (including filings with Governmental

6.5             PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS

         Itron and the Company will consult with each other before issuing any
press release or otherwise making any public statements with respect to the

Tax Return no later than thirty (30) days prior to the filing date of such Tax
Return and shall make such revisions to such Tax Returns as are reasonably
requested by Jones.

of its representations or warranties herein such that the condition set forth in

representatives will (i) solicit or initiate any inquiries or the making of any
proposal with respect to any merger, consolidation or other business combination
involving the Company or the acquisition of any of the assets or share capital
of the Company (a "Takeover Proposal") or (ii) negotiate, explore or otherwise
engage in discussion with any Person (other than Itron and its representatives)
with respect to any Takeover Proposal, or which may reasonably be expected to
lead to a Takeover Proposal, or (iii) enter into any agreement, arrangement or
understanding with respect to any such Takeover Proposal or which would require
it to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the Amalgamation or any other
transaction contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, that the Company
may, in

                                      -53-

<PAGE>

response to an unsolicited written proposal from a third party regarding a
Superior Proposal (as hereinafter defined), furnish information to, negotiate or
otherwise engage in discussions with such third party, if the Board of Directors
of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial
advisors and based upon advice of outside counsel, that such action is required
for the Board of Directors to comply with its fiduciary duties under applicable
law. As used herein, a "Superior Proposal" means a bona fide, written and
unsolicited proposal or offer made by any Person (or group) (other than Itron or
any of its subsidiaries) with respect to a Takeover Proposal on terms which the
Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, and in the exercise
of reasonable judgment, to be more favorable to the Company and its shareholders
than the transactions contemplated hereby.

9.2             TERMINATION OF CURRENT DISCUSSIONS

         Except as may be required pursuant to the fiduciary duties of the
Company's Board of Directors under applicable law, the Company agrees that, as
of the date hereof, it and its directors, officers, employees, agents and
representatives, shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing
activities, discussions or negotiations with any Person (other than Itron and
its representatives) conducted heretofore with respect to any Takeover Proposal.
The Company shall ensure that the Company Representatives are aware of the
provisions of this Article IX, and it shall be responsible for any breach of
this Article IX by any such Company Representative. The Company agrees to
promptly advise Itron of any inquiries or proposals received by, any such
information requested from, or any negotiations or discussions sought to be
initiated or continued with, the Company, or any of its directors, officers,
employees, agents or representatives, in each case from a Person (other than
Itron and its representatives) with respect to a Takeover Proposal, and the
terms thereof, including the identity of such third party and the general terms
of any financing arrangement or commitment in connection with such Takeover
Proposal, and, to update on an ongoing basis or upon Itron's reasonable request,
the status thereof, as well as any actions taken or other developments pursuant
to this Article IX.

9.3             NOTICE BY THE COMPANY OF SUPERIOR PROPOSAL DETERMINATION

         (a)    Notwithstanding Sections 9.1 and 9.2, the Company may accept,
approve, recommend or enter into any agreement, understanding or arrangement in
respect of a Superior Proposal if, and only if: (i) the Company has complied
with its obligations under Section 9.2; (ii) five (5) calendar days shall have
elapsed from the date on which the Company provided notice under Section 9.2;
(iii) the Company's Board of Directors has received written advice from outside
counsel that such action is required for the Company's Board of Directors to
comply with its fiduciary duties under applicable law, and the Company's Board
of Directors has resolved, subject to paragraph (b) of this Section 9.3 to
accept, approve or recommend the negotiation of an agreement with respect to
such Superior Proposal; and (iv) it has previously or concurrently with the
expiration of such five (5) calendar day period will have paid to Itron the
reimbursements, if any, payable under Section 8.2 and terminated this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.1(e).

         (b)    During such five calendar day period, the Company agrees that
Itron shall have the right, but not the obligation, to offer to amend the terms
of this Agreement. The Board of Directors of the Company will review any offer
by Itron to amend the terms of this Agreement in

                                      -54-

<PAGE>

good faith in order to determine, in its discretion in the exercise of its
fiduciary duties, whether Itron's offer upon acceptance by the Company would
result in such Superior Proposal ceasing to be a Superior Proposal. If the Board
of Directors of the Company so determines, it will enter into an amended
agreement with Itron reflecting Itron's amended offer. If the Board of Directors
of the Company continues to believe, in good faith and after consultation with
financial advisors and outside counsel, that such Superior Proposal remains a
Superior Proposal and therefore rejects Itron's amended offer, the Company may
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(e); provided, however, that the
Company must concurrently pay to Itron the reimbursements, if any, payable to
Itron under Section 8.2. The Company acknowledges and agrees that payment of the
reimbursements, if any, payable under Section 8.2 is a condition to valid
termination of this Agreement under such section and this Section 9.3.

         (c)    The Company also acknowledges and agrees that each successive
modification of any Superior Proposal shall constitute a new Superior Proposal
for purposes of the requirement under clause (b) of this Section 9.3 to initiate
an additional five calendar days notice period.

9.4             RECOMMENDATION

         (a)    The Company shall perform all obligations required or desirable
to be performed by the Company under this Agreement and shall do all such other
acts and things as may be necessary or desirable in order to consummate and make
effective, as soon as reasonably practicable, the transactions contemplated in
this Agreement and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Company shall, subject to Section 9.3:

                (i)    recommend in the Information Statement and at the Meeting
that Company Shareholders vote in favor of the Amalgamation Resolution, and all
public comment by the Company in relation to the Amalgamation shall be made in
accordance with Section 6.6 and shall be consistent with and supportive of such
recommendation; the Company shall not act in any way that might reasonably be
expected to discourage Company Shareholders from voting in favor of the
Amalgamation Resolution or that might encourage the Company Shareholders to vote
against the Amalgamation Resolution or to exercise their Dissent Rights;

                (ii)   not withdraw the recommendation that Company Shareholders
vote in favor of the Amalgamation Resolution or modify or amend, in a manner
adverse to Itron, such recommendation;

                (iii)  use all reasonable efforts to cause the directors and
officers of the Company to: (A) support the Amalgamation; and (B) not dispose of
any Company Common Shares held by them before the Amalgamation Resolution has
been approved by Company Shareholders or this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with its terms, whichever occurs first.

         (b)    The Company shall promptly reaffirm its recommendation of the
Amalgamation by press release and at Itron's option, by supplementary mailing to
Company Shareholders, after:

                (i)    any Takeover Proposal (which is determined by the Company
under Section 9.3 not to be a Superior Proposal) is publicly announced or made;
or

                                      -55-

<PAGE>

(ii) Itron increases (by written notice to the Company pursuant to Section 9.3),
the consideration offered under this Agreement and the Board of Directors of the
Company determines, under Section 9.3, to proceed with the amended Itron offer.
Any such press release shall be prepared in accordance with Section 6.6.

                                    ARTICLE X
                                 INDEMNIFICATION

10.1            INDEMNIFICATION BY JONES

         Subject to Sections 10.5 and 10.6, Jones shall defend, indemnify, and
hold Itron and the Surviving Corporation and their respective directors,
officers and other Affiliates harmless from and against, and to reimburse Itron
and the Surviving Corporation and their respective directors, officers and other
Affiliates with respect to, any and all Losses incurred by them by reason of or
arising out of or in connection with: (a) any breach, or any claim (including
claims by parties other than Itron) that if true, would constitute a breach of
any representation or warranty of the Company contained in this Agreement, and
(b) the failure, partial or total, of the Company to perform any agreement or
covenant required by this Agreement to be performed by it. The indemnification
obligations of Jones pursuant to clauses (a) and (b) of the foregoing sentence
shall apply only to the extent that the aggregate Losses incurred in connection
therewith exceed One Hundred Thousand American Dollars (US$100,000); provided,
however, that the indemnification obligations of Jones shall not be so limited
with respect to any Losses incurred in connection with any breach or any claim
that, if true, would constitute a breach of a misrepresentation or warranty set
forth in Section 4.1(i), 4.1(x) or 4.1(z).

10.2            INDEMNIFICATION BY ITRON

         Subject to Section 10.5, Itron agrees to defend, indemnify, and hold
harmless Jones from and against, and to reimburse Jones with respect to, any and
all Losses incurred by Jones by reason of or arising out of or in connection
with: (a) any breach, or any claim (including claims by parties other than the
Company or Jones) that if true, would constitute a breach of any representation
or warranty of Itron contained in this Agreement, and (b) the failure, partial
or total, of Itron to perform any agreement or covenant required by this
Agreement to be performed by it, but only to the extent that the aggregate
Losses incurred in connection therewith exceed One Hundred Thousand American
Dollars (US$100,000).

10.3            CLAIMS BETWEEN THE PARTIES

         All claims for indemnification under this Agreement, other than Third
Party Claims as described in Section 10.4, shall be resolved in accordance with
the following procedures:

         (a)    NOTICE OF CLAIMS

                (i)    If an indemnified party reasonably believes that it has
incurred or may incur any Losses, it shall deliver a Claim Notice to the
indemnifying party with respect to such Losses. The failure to give such notice
shall not affect the rights of the indemnified party or parties except to the
extent that the indemnifying party is materially prejudiced by such failure.

                                      -56-

<PAGE>

                (ii)   When Losses are actually incurred or paid by an
indemnified party or on an indemnified party's behalf or otherwise fixed or
determined, the indemnified party shall deliver a notice in writing (a "Payment
Certificate") to the indemnifying party for such Losses.

                (iii)  If, after receiving a Payment Certificate, the
indemnifying party desires to dispute such claim or the amount claimed in the
Payment Certificate, it shall deliver to the indemnified party within thirty
(30) days a Counternotice as to such claim or amount. If no such Counternotice
is received within the aforementioned thirty (30) day period, the indemnifying
party shall be deemed to have accepted liability in respect of the Payment
Certificate.

                (iv)   The parties will use good faith efforts for a thirty (30)
day period in an effort to resolve the issue. If, however, within thirty (30)
days after receipt or deemed receipt by the indemnified party of the
Counternotice to a Payment Certificate, the parties have not reached agreement
as to the claim or amount in question, the claim for indemnification shall be
decided in accordance with the provisions of Section 10.3(b), unless otherwise
specified in this Agreement.

                (v)    With respect to any Losses for which indemnification is
being claimed based upon an asserted liability or obligation to a Person or
entity not a party to this Agreement, the obligations of the indemnifying party
hereunder shall not be reduced as a result of any action by the indemnified
party in responding to such claim if such action is reasonably required to
minimize damages, avoid a forfeiture or penalty, or comply with a legal
requirement.

         (b)    RESOLUTION OF CLAIMS

                (i)    All claims for indemnification under this Agreement,
other than Third Party Claims as described in Section 10.4, shall be submitted
to final and binding arbitration in Spokane, Washington, which arbitration
shall, except as specifically stated herein, be conducted in accordance with the
CPR Non-Administered Arbitration Rules (the "CPR Rules") then in effect;
provided, however, that the parties agree first to try in good faith to resolve
any claim for indemnification that does not exceed Two Hundred Fifty Thousand
American Dollars (US$250,000) by mediation under the CPR Mediation Procedure for
Business Disputes, before resorting to arbitration; provided, further, that, in
the event of an arbitration, the arbitration provisions of this Agreement shall
govern over any conflicting rules which may now or hereafter be contained in the
CPR Rules.

                (ii)   The final decision of the arbitrator(s) shall be a
reasoned opinion based on applicable law and furnished in writing to the parties
and will constitute a conclusive determination of the issue in question, binding
upon the parties. The arbitrator(s) shall have the authority to grant any
equitable and legal remedies that would be available in any judicial proceeding
instituted to resolve a claim for indemnification. Any judgment upon the award
rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction
over the subject matter thereof.

                (iii)  Any such arbitration shall be conducted before a single
arbitrator, who will be compensated for his or her services, as provided below
in Section 10.3(b)(v), at a rate to be determined by the parties or pursuant to
the CPR Rules, but based upon reasonable hourly or

                                      -57-

<PAGE>

daily consulting rates for the arbitrator in the event the parties are not able
to agree upon his or her rate of compensation.

                (iv)   The parties shall select the arbitrator by mutual
agreement promptly following initiation of arbitration in accordance with the
CPR Rules; provided, however, that in the event the parties are unable to reach
such agreement within twenty (20) days of initiation, the CPR shall have the
authority to select an arbitrator from a list of arbitrators who are partners in
a nationally recognized firm of independent certified public accountants from
the management advisory services department (or comparable department or group)
of such firm or who are partners in a major law firm; provided, however, that
such accounting firm or law firm cannot be a firm that has within the last three
(3) years rendered, or is then rendering, services to any party hereto or, in
the case of a law firm, appeared, or is then appearing, as counsel of record in
opposition to any party hereto. Any arbitrator selected to serve shall be
qualified by training and experience for the matters for which such arbitrator
is designated to serve. If the parties are unable to agree upon one arbitrator,
each shall appoint an arbitrator and these appointees shall appoint a third
arbitrator, in which case the arbitration determination shall be made by a
majority decision of the three selected arbitrators.

                (v)    The prevailing party in any arbitration shall be
entitled to an award of reasonable attorneys' fees and costs, and all costs of
arbitration, including those provided for above, will be paid by the losing
party, subject in each case to a determination by the arbitrator as to which
party is the prevailing party and the amount of such fees and costs to be
allocated to such party. Any amounts payable under this subsection will be
reimbursed as if the amount of such awarded fees and costs were not contested,
and the parties will have no further liability for any amounts payable under
this Section 10.3(b) for such fees and costs.

                (vi)   The arbitrator(s) chosen in accordance with these
provisions shall not have the power to alter, amend or otherwise affect the
terms of these arbitration provisions or the provisions of this Agreement or any
other documents that are executed in connection therewith.

10.4            THIRD PARTY CLAIMS

         (a)    If an indemnified party receives notice of a demand for
arbitration, summons or other notice of the commencement of a proceeding, audit,
investigation, review, suit or other action by a third party (any such action a
"Third Party Claim") for which it intends to seek indemnification hereunder, it
shall give the indemnifying party prompt written notice of such claim (together
with all copies of the claim, any process served, and all filings with respect
thereto), so that the indemnifying party's defense of such claim under this
Section 10.4 may be timely instituted. The indemnifying party under this Article
X shall have the right to conduct and control, through counsel (reasonably
acceptable to the indemnified party) of its own choosing and at its own cost,
any Third Party Claim, compromise, or settlement thereof. Assumption by an
indemnifying party of control of any such defense, compromise, or settlement
shall not be a waiver by it of its right to challenge its obligation to
indemnify the indemnified party. The indemnified party may, at its election,
participate in the defense of any such claim, action, or suit through counsel of
its choosing, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense
of the indemnified party, unless the indemnified party shall have been advised
by such counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses available to it
that are different from

                                      -58-

<PAGE>

or in addition to those available to the indemnifying party (in which case, if
the indemnified party notifies the indemnifying party in writing that it elects
separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party, the indemnifying
party shall not have the right to assume the defense of such action on behalf of
the indemnified party with respect to such defenses).

         (b)    If the indemnifying party fails to defend diligently any Third
Party Claim, then the indemnified party may defend, with counsel of its own
choosing, and (i) settle such Third Party Claim and then recover from the
indemnifying party the amount of such settlement or of any judgment and the
reasonable costs and expenses of such defense, or (ii) litigate the Third Party
Claim to the completion of trial or arbitration and then promptly recover from
the indemnifying party the reasonable costs and expense of such defense and the
amount of the judgment, verdict or award, if any, against the indemnified party.

         (c)    Notwithstanding Section 10.4(b)(i), the indemnifying party shall
not be liable to pay or otherwise satisfy any settlement of a Third Party Claim
unless the indemnified party shall have given the indemnifying party written
notice of the terms of the proposed settlement at least twenty (20) days prior
to entering into such settlement.

         (d)    Without the consent of the indemnified party, the indemnifying
party shall not compromise or settle any Third Party Claim if such settlement
involves an admission of liability or wrongdoing on the party of the indemnified
party, or a restriction on the operation of the indemnified party's business in
the future or would adversely affect the business reputation or Tax liability of
the indemnified party. No Third Party Claim may be settled by an indemnifying
party without the written consent of the indemnified party, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. No settlement of a Third Party Claim
that involves the payment of money only shall be made by any indemnifying party
unless the indemnifying party has and reserves a sufficient amount of
immediately available funds to provide for such settlement.

         (e)    Itron, Jones, and the Surviving Corporation shall cooperate in
all reasonable respects with each other in connection with the defense,
negotiation, or settlement of any legal proceeding, claim, or demand referred to
in this Section 10.4.

10.5            TIME LIMIT

         The provisions of this Article X (other than the last sentence of
Section 10.6(a)) shall apply only to Losses that are incurred or relate to
claims, demands, or liabilities that are asserted or threatened before May 15,
2004; provided, however, that: (i) the obligation of either party to indemnify
the other and its directors and officers for such claims for which a Claim
Notice is given within the time period set forth above shall continue until the
final resolution of each such claim; (ii) the limitation set forth in this
Section 10.5 shall not apply to any right to indemnification for a failure to
perform any agreement or covenant set forth in this Agreement, which shall
survive the Effective Time of the Amalgamation indefinitely; and (iii) the
representations set forth in Sections 4.1(i), 4.1(x) and 4.1(z) which shall
survive until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations.
Furthermore, the right to indemnification for Taxes under Section 10.1 hereof
shall survive until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitation for
such Taxes.

                                      -59-

<PAGE>

10.6            LIMITATIONS

         (a)    The aggregate amount for which Jones shall be liable pursuant to
this Article X shall not exceed Five Hundred Thousand American Dollars
(US$500,000). Except for Losses based upon fraud or knowing misrepresentation,
the sole remedy of Itron for breaches of this Agreement shall be claims made in
accordance with and subject to the limitations in this Article X.

         (b)    The indemnification obligations of Jones under this Article X
shall be satisfied by payment to Itron of the obligations by Jones from the
Indemnification Escrow.

         (c)    Whenever Jones delivers to Itron a certified copy of an
unconditional release, reasonably acceptable to Itron as to form and content,
addressed to the Company (or addressed to the Surviving Corporation after the
Closing Date) and executed by each of TGR Group, LLC, ICH Investments Ltd.,
Largo Flight Limited, and any related entities who have made any claim upon the
Company in relation to or in connection with investment relations or public
relations activities contracted for or performed in relation to the Company,
then the aggregate amount for which Jones shall be liable pursuant to this
Article X shall not exceed Three Hundred Twenty-Five Thousand American Dollars
(US$325,000).

                                   ARTICLE XI
                               GENERAL PROVISIONS

11.1            SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

         The representations and warranties made by the parties to this
Agreement and contained herein or in any instrument delivered by the Company or
Itron pursuant to this Agreement shall survive until May 15, 2004; provided,
however, that the warranties contained in Section 4.1(i) shall survive until the
relevant expiration of the statute of limitations period and Sections 4.1(a),
4.1(b), 4.1(c)(i), 4.2(a), 4.2(b) and 4.2(c)(i) shall survive indefinitely.

11.2            NOTICES

         All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and
