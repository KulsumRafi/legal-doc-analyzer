2.8  Dell may, at its option during the term of this Agreement, enter into the
     Master Preferred Escrow Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit H ("Escrow
     Agreement") between DSI Technology Escrow

<PAGE>

         Services, Inc. ("Escrow Agent") and Licensor, as a Preferred
         Beneficiary. In such event, Licensor will deposit with the Escrow Agent
         the source code for the Licensed Product(s) (the "Deposit Materials")
         under the terms and conditions set forth in the Escrow Agreement and
         this Section 2.0. Licensor agrees to update the Deposit Materials
         within ninety (90) days upon each release of a New Version of the
         Licensed Product(s). Dell acknowledges that the Deposit Materials will
         not include any third party software, source code, tools, or other
         materials, whether or not related to the Software. In addition to the
         procedural requirements and other conditions governing the release of
         the Deposit Materials as set forth in the Escrow Agreement, DSI will
         release a copy of the Deposit Materials to Dell only if there is a
         Failure to Support the Licensed Product(s) by Licensor. Under this
         Section, "Failure to Support" shall mean: (1) in the event of a
         Severity 5, 4, or 3 problem, Licensor has not assigned appropriate
         personnel to such severity level and not provided any of the required
         update reports in accordance with Section 5.0 of Exhibit C, and (2)
         such failure continues for: (a) with respect to a Severity 5 problem,
         three (3) business days; (b) with respect to a Severity 4 problem, ten
         (10) business days; and (c) with respect to a Severity 3 problem,
         fifteen (15) business days. Before Dell can assert a Failure to
         Support, Licensor and Dell shall meet (including by telephone
         conference) within five (5) business days of Licensor's receipt of
         Dell's notice in an attempt to address any Failure to Support. If the
         Failure to Support is not resolved by the representatives at such
         meeting (or conference call) or the parties have not met within such
         five (5) business days, the chief executive officer of Licensor or his
         designee and a Vice President of Dell shall meet (including by
         telephone conference) within fifteen (15) business days of the
         previously failed meeting. If the Failure to Support is still not
         resolved after such meeting or such meeting does not take place within
         such fifteen (15) business days because Licensor's chief executive
         officer or his designee have not been available, then the Failure to
         Support shall be deemed to be a proper Failure to Support, subject to
         Licensor proving otherwise.

2.9      Effective upon proper release of the Deposit Materials, Licensor hereby
         grants Dell a perpetual, non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-free,
         worldwide license to use the Deposit Materials only as necessary to
         support the licensed use of the Licensed Product(s) by Dell customers
         as expressly set forth in this Agreement. Dell shall not use the
         Deposit Materials for any other purpose. Dell grants Licensor a
         perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive non-transferable license to use any
         derivative works developed by Dell pursuant to this Section 2.9 or
         under Section 2.1(iv) only as necessary to support the licensed use of
         the Licensed Product(s) by Dell customers as expressly set forth in
         this Agreement.

2.10     If the Deposit Materials released and delivered to Dell under the
         Escrow Agreement include any software and/or other materials that are
         not included in the Licensed Product(s), Dell shall promptly delete or
         destroy that material and shall not disclose it or use it for any
         purpose whatsoever. Licensor reserves all rights not expressly granted
         herein, and all rights in and to the Licensed Product(s) and the
         Deposit Materials remain the exclusive and absolute property of
         Licensor and/or its licensors.

2.11     Dell acknowledges and agrees that the Deposit Materials and all copies,
         partial copies, and all information contained therein, as well as all
         intellectual property rights associated therewith (collectively,
         "Confidential Materials") are confidential and proprietary and
         constitute valuable trade secrets of Licensor and/or the respective
         manufacturer or author. Dell shall maintain the terms of the Escrow
         Agreement and the Confidential Materials in strict confidence, and
         shall not sell, transfer, publish, disclose, display or otherwise make
         accessible the Confidential Materials, or any copies thereof, in whole
         or in part, to any third party. Dell shall secure and protect the
         Confidential Materials with the same degree of care it uses to protect
         its own confidential and trade secret information of the highest
         importance and most sensitive nature. Internal dissemination of the
         Confidential Materials by Dell shall be limited to its employees whose
         duties justify the need to know such information.

2.12     To the extent there is any conflict between the provisions of this
         Section 2.0 and the Escrow Agreement, the provisions of this Section
         2.0 shall control. Dell agrees to pay all escrow fees applicable to the
         Deposit Materials that are invoiced by Licensor.

<PAGE>

         (d)   Dell shall provide Licensor with a sales volume report setting
         forth the amount of sales for the Licensed Product(s), Licensor
         Application(s), and Training and Professional Services for the
         corresponding Dell fiscal quarter. Dell shall provide this sales volume
         report to Licensor within thirty (30) days of the end of each Dell
         fiscal quarter. Licensor shall remit the rebate amounts associated with
         such sales volume report within thirty (30) days of receipt of such
         report. Payment shall be by wire transfer to an identified General
         Account number and be sent to an address specified upon Agreement
         signature.

3.3      Unless otherwise agreed to by the Parties, in the event of Revenue
         Shared Sales, Licensor shall remit to Dell an amount equal to [*] of
         gross revenue of sales of Licensor products less credit for returned
         product or [*] of gross revenue of sales of training and professional
         services. Dell shall provide Licensor with revenue reports for Revenue
         Shared Sales within thirty (30) days of the end of Dell's fiscal
         quarters and Licensor will remit revenue share on such revenue reports
         to Dell within thirty (30) days of receipt of such report. Payment
         shall be by wire transfer to an identified General Account number and
         be sent to an address specified upon Agreement signature.

3.4      [*]

3.5      All applicable taxes, including but not limited to sales/use taxes,
         withholding taxes, transaction privilege taxes, gross receipts taxes,
         and other charges such as duties, customs, tariffs, imposts, and
         government imposed surcharges imposed upon the Licensed Product(s) and
         Licensor Application(s), and services provided, to Dell under this
         Agreement shall be paid by Dell. Dell shall have the responsibility to
         pay such taxes either directly to the applicable taxing authorities, or
         to Licensor, as a seller, under the circumstances in which Licensor has
         the responsibility for collecting and remitting said taxes to the
         taxing authorities pursuant to state or local law. In the latter case,
         Licensor shall collect and remit all such taxes to the appropriate tax
         authorities unless Dell provides sufficient proof of tax exemption. In
         the circumstance where Licensor has tax collection and remittance
         responsibilities, Licensor shall have the responsibility of invoicing
         Dell for such taxes and Dell shall remit such invoiced amounts to
         Licensor. In the event that Licensor does not properly invoice Dell,
         and is subsequently audited by any tax authority, the liability of Dell
         will be limited to the tax assessment, with no reimbursement for
         penalty or interest charges if such assessment of tax was solely due to
         Licensor's failure to timely invoice Dell and to collect and remit such
         tax. The foregoing tax provision is applicable to all transfers under
         this Agreement, including the transfers of licenses for software. Each
         Party is and shall be responsible for its own respective income taxes
         or taxes based upon gross revenues, net income or capital, including
         but not limited to business and occupation taxes. Notwithstanding the
         above, in the event that income taxes are required to be withheld by
         any non-U.S.A. government on payments to Licensor required hereunder
         (and provided that Dell shall co-operate, if necessary, within a
         reasonable period of time delivers to Licensor an official receipt for
         any such taxes withheld or other documents necessary to

         documentation available, a claim for a U.S.A. Foreign Tax Credit) Dell
         may deduct such taxes from the amount owed Licensor and shall pay the
         taxes to the appropriate taxing authority. In the event multiple levels
         of withholding taxes are available for designation by Dell, Dell will
         use reasonable efforts, consistent with applicable legal requirements,
         to minimize in its designation any such withholding taxes. Dell will
         reasonably cooperate with Licensor should Licensor, in its discretion,
         choose to undertake efforts to assure that any withheld taxes are
         minimized to the extent possible under applicable law.

4.0      PRE-DELIVERY TESTING, DELIVERY AND ACCEPTANCE

4.1      Prior to delivery, Licensor shall perform all testing necessary to

                  Application(s) are not encrypted, nor do they contain
                  encryption capability; if the Licensed Product(s), Limited
                  Product(s) and Licensor Application(s) do contain encryption
                  capabilities, Licensor agrees to adhere to the requirements
                  described in Exhibit A.

         (g)      At the time of delivery to Dell, there is no restriction of
                  any relevant governmental authority which prohibits the export
                  of the Licensed Product(s), Limited Product(s) and Licensor
                  Application(s) to countries outside the United States and
                  Canada, other than

                  Montenegro, North Korea, Serbia, Syria, Sudan, Iran and Iraq,
                  as amended from time to time by the United States Government;

         (h)      at the time of delivery, Licensor shall insure that all
                  updates and upgrades to the Licensed Product(s), Limited
                  Product(s) and Licensor Application(s) provided by Licensor to
                  Dell comply with all applicable governmental laws, statutes,
                  rules and regulations including, but not limited to, those
                  related to export of product and technical data, and Licensor
                  agrees that for any Updates and New Versions which are
                  licensed to Dell pursuant to the terms of this Agreement,
                  Licensor shall provide prior written notice of any facts which
                  would make the foregoing representations untrue;

         (i)      Licensor will warrant the Licensed Product(s), Limited
                  Product(s) and Licensor Application(s) directly to the
                  end-user in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth
                  in Licensor's EULA; and

         (j)      Licensor has agreed to honor all replacement requests received
                  from Dell or end users under the terms of the EULA pertaining
                  to defective Licensed Product(s), Limited Product(s) and
                  Licensor Application(s).

7.2      Dell's exclusive remedy and Licensor's entire liability for any breach
         of the warranties in Section 7.1 shall be the remedies specified as set
         forth in Section 8 (Indemnification) of this Agreement.

7.3      The foregoing warranties do not apply, and Licensor shall have no
         liability for any claims arising out of: (i) Dell's use or distribution
         of other than a current unaltered release of the Licensed Product(s)
         and Licensor Application(s); (ii) Dell's use of the Licensed Product(s)
         and Licensor Application(s) modified or merged with any other programs
         by Dell or others (excluding software necessary to run the Licensed
         Product(s) and Licensor Application(s)) without the approval of
         Licensor; or (iii) Dell's use or distribution of the Licensed
         Product(s) and Licensor Application(s) in conjunction with equipment
         other than Dell products and equipment.

7.4      Dell represents and warrants to Licensor that (a) Dell's systems that
         contain the Licensed Product(s) and Licensor Application(s) shall not
         infringe any copyright, patent, trade secrets, or other intellectual
         property or similar rights of any third party; and (b) Dell shall not
         infringe any of Licensor's copyright, patents, trade secrets, or other
         intellectual property or similar rights relative to the Licensed
         Product(s) or Licensor Applications.

7.5      Except as specifically set forth in Section 7.0, neither Party makes
         any warranties, representations or conditions regarding the Licensed
         Product(s) and Licensor Application(s) or Dell systems. BOTH PARTIES
         SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIM ANY AND ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, IMPLIED,
         STATUTORY OR ARISING OUT OF A COURSE OF DEALING, SPECIFICALLY INCLUDING
         ANY WARRANTY AGAINST INFRINGEMENT, AND THE WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
         MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

8.0      INDEMNIFICATION

8.1      Licensor shall indemnify, defend or settle, at Licensor's expense, any
         third party expense, liability or claim ("Claim") brought against Dell
         to the extent based on a breach of the warranties in Section 7.1 above.
         Licensor's obligations set forth in this Section are subject to the
         conditions that Dell: (i) promptly gives notice to Licensor of the
         Claim, (ii) allows Licensor to control the defense and settlement of
         such Claim, and (iii) gives Licensor, all necessary information and
         reasonable assistance with respect to such Claim. Licensor shall pay
         all amounts paid in settlement and all damages and costs awarded to
         such third party with respect to a final resolution of such Claim,
         including reasonable attorney's fee, costs and expenses associated with
         an action required in an award granted to such third party. If any
         particular Licensed Product(s) or Licensor Application(s) is subject to
         a Claim, or Licensor reasonably believes that the Licensed Product(s)
         or Licensor

<PAGE>

       Application(s) may become subject to a Claim, then Licensor may, at its
       sole option and expense do one of the following: (i) obtain an
       appropriate license to allow continued use of the Licensed Product(s) or
       Licensor Application(s) in question in accordance with this Agreement;
       (ii) replace such Licensed Product(s) or Licensor Application(s) with
       non-infringing software of substantially equivalent or better functions
       and efficiency; or (iii) if Licensor in its sole discretion believes that
       either of the foregoing options is not practical, terminate Dell's right
       to use or distribute such Licensed Product(s) or Licensor Application(s),
       in which case Licensor shall refund the amount Dell previously paid to
       Licensor for the use by Dell of such Licensed Product(s) or Licensor
       Application(s), less a portion thereof to account for the period of use,
       and accept return of the license(s) and associated software and media.
       The portion shall be a pro-rated portion based on a four year useful life
       depreciated using a straight-line method.

8.2    The foregoing notwithstanding, Licensor shall have no liability or
       obligation for the portion of a Claim that it is based on (i) the use or
       distribution by Dell of any Licensed Product(s) or Licensor
       Application(s) after Licensor has provided Dell a replacement for such
       Licensed Product(s) or Licensor Application(s); (ii) the combination of
       any Licensed Product(s) or Licensor Application(s) with other software,
       equipment, materials or products not provided by Licensor other than the
       Dell products; (iii) unrelated intellectual property infringement arising
       from Dell's distribution of products; (iv) the modification of any of the
       Licensed Product(s) or Licensor Application(s) by anyone other than
       Licensor; or (v) the use of the Licensed Product(s) or Licensor
       Application(s) in a process or manner not contemplated by Licensor's end
       user documentation or publications for the Licensed Product(s) or
       Licensor Application(s) provided to Dell.

9.0    TERM AND TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT

9.1    Unless earlier terminated as provided below, the term of this Agreement
       shall be for three (3) years from the Effective Date and, unless either
       Party gives thirty (30) days notice of non-renewal prior to the end of
       the initial term, this Agreement shall automatically renew for successive
       one (1) year periods.

9.2    Either Party may, at its option and upon written notice to the other
       Party, terminate this Agreement if: (a) a material breach of this
       Agreement by the other Party is not remedied within thirty (30) days
       after the breaching Party's receipt of written notice of the breach; (b)
       the other Party admits in writing its inability to pay its debts
       generally as they become due, files a petition for bankruptcy or executes
       an assignment for the benefit of creditors or similar document; or (c) a
       receiver, trustee in bankruptcy or similar officer is appointed for the
       other Party's property. Either Party may terminate this Agreement without
       cause upon 180 days prior written notice to the other Party. Neither
       Party will, by reason of the termination, be liable to the other Party
       for compensation, reimbursement, or damages on account of any loss of
       prospective profits on anticipated sales, or on account of any
       expenditures, investments, or other commitments made in connection with
       the other Party's business or goodwill, or otherwise, provided the
       termination is properly noticed.

9.3    All licenses and sublicenses granted to end users with respect to the
       Licensed Product(s) or Licensor Application(s) sold under this Agreement
       shall continue in effect after expiration or termination of this
       Agreement. All provisions of Sections 7.0, 8.0, 9.0, 10.0, 11.0, and
       12.0, shall survive any expiration or termination of this Agreement and
       shall bind the Parties and their successors, heirs, assigns and legal
       representatives. In addition, Licensor's obligations under Section 2, 4
       and 5 with respect to escrow, support and maintenance, shall survive for
       one (1) year after any expiration or termination of this Agreement solely
       for Dell to satisfy its then existing contractual obligations to its
       customers and licensees. The parties will work together to develop a
       mutually agreeable plan to provide continued service to affected Dell end
       users after the expiration of Licensor's support obligations pursuant to
       the foregoing, which may include, without limitation, payment of
       additional fees to Licensor. Dell shall retain a limited license in
       accordance with Section 2 to use the Licensed Product(s) and Licensor
       Application(s) in order to satisfy such

<PAGE>

       existing contractual obligations for one (1) year and to exhaust its
       inventory of Licensed Product(s) existing at expiration or termination,
       provided that Dell's right to exhaust any such inventory shall not extend
       beyond 90 days after expiration or termination of this Agreement, and
       provided Dell makes any payments required under Section 3. Thereafter,
       Dell agrees to return or destroy all additional copies of the Licensed
       Product(s) and Licensor Application(s) in its possession.

10.0   LIMITATION OF LIABILITIES

10.1   EXCEPT FOR CLAIMS OR LIABILITIES OCCURRING UNDER SECTION 7.1(C) LIMITED
       TO "CLAIMS" (AS THE TERM "CLAIM" IS DEFINED IN SECTION 8.1), AND 7.4
       ABOVE, NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
       PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES UNDER ANY PART OF THIS AGREEMENT
       EVEN IF ADVISED OR AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

       considered by either Party to be confidential information will be subject
       to the terms and conditions of the non-disclosure agreement #99042607 in
       place between the Parties. Licensor shall not provide to Dell any
       information which is considered confidential information of any third
       party.

12.0   MISCELLANEOUS

12.1   This Agreement shall in no way preclude either Party from independently
       developing, having developed or acquiring or marketing any products or
       services nor shall it in any way preclude either Party from entering into
       any similar agreement with any other party.

12.2   Dell shall have full freedom and flexibility in its decisions (provided
       such decisions are consistent with the terms of this Agreement)
       concerning the distribution and marketing (except as provided in Section
       6) of the Licensed Product(s), Limited Product(s) and Licensor
       Application(s) including, without limitation, the decision of whether or
       not to distribute or discontinue distribution of the Licensed Product(s),
       Limited Product(s) and Licensor Application(s). Dell does not guarantee
       that its marketing, if any, of the Licensed Product(s), Limited
       Product(s) and Licensor Application(s) will be successful.

12.3   This Agreement may not be assigned by either Party, in whole or in part,
       without the express written permission of the other Party, not to be
       unreasonably withheld. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Party may
       assign this Agreement, in whole or in part, in connection with a merger,
       stock or asset sale, reorganization or acquisition, without the other
       Party's written permission. Any attempted assignment in violation of this
       Section shall be void. If a Party assigns this Agreement without the

       option to immediately terminate this Agreement for cause. The assigning
       Party shall make

<PAGE>

       reasonable efforts to provide the non-assigning Party with at least

       inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors and
       permitted assigns.

12.4   The Parties are independent contractors, and nothing contained in this
       Agreement shall be construed to create or imply a joint venture,
       partnership, principal-agent or employment relationship. Neither Party
       shall have the right or authority to create or incur any liability or any
       obligation of any kind, express or implied, against, or in the name of,
       or on behalf of the other Party.

12.5   [*]

12.6   All publicity concerning the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
       shall be jointly planned and coordinated by and between the Parties.

       not be unreasonably withheld. Further, neither Party shall disclose the
       terms and conditions of this Agreement to any third party, including, but
       not limited to, any financial terms, except as required by law or with
       the other Party's prior written consent.

       right to a trial by jury relating to any dispute arising under or in
       connection with this Agreement.

12.10  Should any provision herein be held by a court of competent jurisdiction

       shall remain in full force and effect.

<PAGE>

12.11  No amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement
       shall be effective unless set forth in a writing executed by an
       authorized representative of each Party. No failure or delay by either
       Party in exercising any right, power or remedy will operate as a waiver
       of any such right, power or remedy. No waiver of any provision of this
       Agreement shall constitute a continuing waiver or a waiver of any similar
       provision unless expressly set forth in a writing signed by an authorized
       representative of each Party.

12.12  Since Dell transacts business with the United States government, Licensor
       must comply with the applicable federal laws and Federal Acquisition
       Regulations ("FARs") including the following:

          It is Dell's policy to take affirmative action to provide equal
          employment opportunity without regard to race, religion, color,
          national origin, age, sex, disability, veterans status or any other
          legally protected status. As a condition of doing business, Dell
          requires Licensor to practice equal opportunity employment and to
          comply with Executive Order 11246, as amended, Section 503 of the
          Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and Section 4212 of the Vietnam Era
          Veteran's Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974, all as amended, and the
          relevant Regulations and Orders of the U.S. Secretary of Labor.
          Additionally, to the extent required by applicable law, the following
          sections of Chapter 60 of Title 41 of the Code of Federal Regulations

          41 CFR 60-1.40.

       Parties relating to the subject matter contained herein, and merges all
       prior discussions and agreements, both oral and written, between the
       Parties. Nothing in any purchase order, invoice, order acknowledgment, or
       other document of Licensor shall be of any effect whatsoever and may not
       affect, alter, or modify the terms and conditions of this Agreement. If
       the terms and conditions of this Agreement conflict with any terms of a
       Dell purchase order relating to the Licensed Product(s) and Licensor
       Application(s), the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall govern.
       The terms and conditions set forth in the Supplement and Exhibits are
       hereby incorporated into this Software License Agreement by reference. If
       the terms and conditions of this Software License Agreement conflict with
       any terms and conditions contained in the Supplement or Exhibits, the
       terms and conditions of the Supplement and Exhibits shall govern.

12.14  Orders issued by Dell pursuant to this Agreement are placed with the
       expectation of potential acquisition of credit for current and/or
       anticipated future offset obligations of Dell, Dell Computer Corporation
       or Dell Computer Corporation's subsidiaries or affiliates, or their
       designated assignees to various governments around the world. Supplier
       agrees to reasonably assist Dell, Dell Computer Corporation or Dell
       Computer Corporation's subsidiaries or affiliates, or their designated
       assignees in their efforts to secure offset credit from these governments
       in an amount equal to the value of the applicable in-country content of
       the orders placed under this Agreement.

12.15  Dell is committed to utilizing socially responsible suppliers that comply
       with all applicable laws and regulations, embrace high standards of
       ethical behavior, and treat their employees fairly, with dignity and
       respect. Licensor represents to Dell that it complies with the following
       minimum standards:

          (a) comply with the applicable legal maximum working hours;
          (b) comply with legal employment age requirements;
          (c) demonstrate a commitment to the health and safety of their
              employees, both in working conditions and housing supplied, if
              applicable;
          (d) make hiring decisions based on ability to do the job, rather than
              on the basis of personal beliefs or characteristics;
          (e) do not utilize forced or indentured labor, or raw materials or
              finished goods produced by forced labor; and

<PAGE>

          (f) do not employ any type of corporal punishment, or mental or
              physical coercion.

12.16    For a period of 12 months following the Effective Date of this
         Agreement, Licensor shall not solicit for employment, any employee of
         Dell or a Subsidiary of Dell. Notwithstanding the foregoing, contacts
         with prospective employees resulting from general advertising, or
         unsolicited contacts that are initiated solely by employees of Dell or
         one of its Subsidiaries, and the recruitment and employment of such
         persons following such unsolicited contacts, shall not be deemed to be
         solicitations prohibited by this Agreement

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties hereto have duly executed this Software License
Agreement by their respective duly authorized officers to be effective as of the

                   ALTIRIS END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT ("EULA")

Software License Agreement

IMPORTANT - READ CAREFULLY: This Altiris Software License Agreement ("License")
is a legal agreement between you (either an individual or a single entity) and
Altiris, Inc. ("Altiris") for the licensing of software products from Altiris.

DO NOT DOWNLOAD, INSTALL, COPY OR USE THIS SOFTWARE UNTIL YOU HAVE READ AND
ACCEPTED THIS LICENSE. BY DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING, COPYING, OR USING THIS
SOFTWARE, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THIS LICENSE. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ANY
TERM OR CONDITION OF THIS LICENSE, ALTIRIS IS NOT WILLING TO LICENSE THE
SOFTWARE TO YOU. IN SUCH EVENT, YOU MAY NOT DOWNLOAD, INSTALL OR USE THE
SOFTWARE. YOU MAY, HOWEVER, RETURN THE SOFTWARE (INCLUDING ALL ACCOMPANYING
MEDIA, DOCUMENTATION, PACKAGING AND MATERIALS) IN AN UNDAMAGED CONDITION TO THE
VENDOR FROM WHOM YOU ACQUIRED IT WITHIN 30 DAYS FOR A REFUND OF THE FEE, IF ANY,
YOU PAID FOR THE LICENSE.

This License governs seven (7) day and thirty (30) day evaluation licenses as
well as all other licenses applicable to Altiris products. There is no fee for
an evaluation license; all other licenses must be purchased from Altiris or its
authorized resellers. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, this
License will also govern any Software updates and upgrades that may be provided
to Licensee in accordance with Altiris' then-current maintenance and support
policies, unless such updates and upgrades are provided under separate license
agreement. Any other software that may be provided with the Software that is
associated with a separate end-user license agreement is licensed to you under
the terms of that license agreement.

1.   Licensee. For purposes of this License, the term "Licensee" means the
person, company or entity that uses the Software under this License. The
Licensee must accept and agree to this License before downloading, installing or
using the Software.

2.   Certificate of License. A "Certificate of License" in the form of a product
or package label or confirmation e-mail will be sent to the Licensee and will
identify the Software licensed to Licensee under this License and the type of
license(s) (see Section 7 below) granted to Licensee for each Software product.

3.   Software and Documentation. "Software" means the computer programs of the
licensed software product(s) in the form and version(s) provided to Licensee,
together with the associated media and corresponding Documentation.
"Documentation" means the end user manual and other documentation (including
print and "online"), if any, provided to Licensee with the Software.

4.   Ownership. All title and intellectual property in and to the Software
(including all copies of the Software made by Licensee) are owned by Altiris and
its licensor(s). The Software is also protected by copyright law and
international treaty provisions. The Software is licensed to Licensee, not sold.

5.   Activation Key. To use the Software, Licensee must first obtain an
"activation key" from Altiris or its authorized reseller. The activation key may
be a printable digital key, a non-printable file, or any other mechanism used by
Altiris for license activation purposes.

6.   Licensed Computers. A "Licensed Computer" is a computer within the
possession and control of Licensee on which the Software may be run or executed
pursuant to the type of license granted to Licensee.

<PAGE>

7.   License Type. The type of license purchased by Licensee determines the
license rights granted to Licensee. The license type will be specified in the
Certificate of License provided to Licensee and/or will be displayed in an
"information about" box when the activation key is applied during the install
process.

a.   Evaluation License - An Evaluation License is a "limited time," "limited
user" license that provides the Licensee an opportunity to try the Software
before buying a full license. A temporary Certificate of License and temporary
activation key will be issued to Licensee for this license. The temporary
Certificate of License will specify the number of Licensed Computers, the number
of users, and the evaluation period. The Software may only be used on the
specified number of Licensed Computers and by no more than the specified number
of users (i.e., employees of Licensee). The Software may only be used for
evaluation purposes. The Software is licensed to Licensee only for the specified
evaluation period, which will begin on the date that the Software is first
downloaded by or delivered to Licensee.

b.   Not for Resale (NFR) Demo License - An NFR Demo license is a special type
of "limited user" evaluation license that is provided exclusively to, and for
use only by, Altiris channel and OEM partners to assist in demonstrating
Altiris' software to prospective customers. In the event the partner
relationship with Altiris expires or is terminated, or the Partner no longer
uses the license as intended, the NFR license will immediately terminate.

c.   Node License - Altiris Vision. This license type and this paragraph are
applicable only to the Altiris Vision software product. The Altiris Vision
Software includes a Master Module for use on a primary computer (typically the
computer of the teacher or instructor) and a User Module for use on the user
computers (typically the computers of the students or trainees). The user
computers are the "nodes" on which the User Module runs. For each Node License
purchased, the Licensee may use the Master Module on one or more primary
computers and the User Module on only the number of nodes (i.e., user computers)
specified by the Certificate of License. Use of the Master Module is limited to
use in connection with the licensed user modules. Use of the User Module is
limited to use in connection with the Master Module(s) resident on the primary
computer(s). The Licensee must purchase a sufficient number of nodes under this
Node License to cover each computer that may, at any time, store, execute or use
the User Module.

d.   Node License - Other Software. This license type is applicable to all
Altiris software products other than the Altiris Vision product. Under the terms
of this Node License, Licensee may use (a) the management infrastructure portion
of the Software product on as many computers as is reasonably necessary to
utilize the Software as described in the applicable Documentation (the "managing
computers"), and (b) the client portion of the Software on only the number of
nodes specified in the Certificate of License. Except for the Helpdesk, Carbon
Copy and Web Admin products (see below), a "node" is the computer (including its
associated hard disk(s) and other storage device(s)) that is managed or is going
to be managed using Altiris Software. Node licenses may be purchased for use on
computers (such as servers, desktop computers, notebook computers and PDAs) to
be managed using Altiris software ("managed computers"). Depending upon the
particular Software product, the Software on the managing computer is used (i)
to gather inventory from, or to send or receive alerts to or from, the managed
computer, or (ii) to configure or change a setting of, or to migrate settings to
or from, the managed computer, or (iii) to deploy, install, erase, or remove any
application, program, file or image to, on or from a hard disk or other storage
device of the managed computer, or (iv) to place a self-extracting application,
program, file or image on a hard disk or other storage device of the managed
computer. (In the case of RapidInstall Software, the self-extracting application
or program is known as a RapidInstall Package or "RIP.")

For any one Software product, only one node is "consumed" for each managed
computer. One node is consumed by a Software product when that product is used
once or multiple times to perform or deliver any of the services described in
clauses (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) above, on or to a managed computer. If two or
more Software products are used on a managed computer, then two or more nodes
(one for each Software product) will be consumed for that managed computer. Node
Licenses purchased for desktop, notebook and PDAs are not transferable for use
on managing servers. Licensee must purchase a sufficient number of nodes under
the terms of this Node License to cover all nodes consumed by a Software product
for the applicable managed computer type. The number and type of Node Licenses
purchased will be specified on the Certificate of License. Additional nodes may
be purchased at Altiris' then-current fees. Under a Node License, each managing
and managed computer is a Licensed Computer.

<PAGE>

(i)    Helpdesk. In the case of Helpdesk Software, a "node" is a managed
computer or any other object that populates the database, such as a printer,
copier, etc. (each, a "managed object"). Under this Node License, Licensee may
use the Software to import into the database and manage any number of managed
objects not to exceed at any one time the total number of licenses purchased
(e.g., if Licensee has purchased 1,000 licenses for Helpdesk, Licensee may
maintain up to, but no more than, 1,000 managed objects in the database at any
one time).

(ii)   Carbon Copy Solution (excluding Carbon Copy consumer version). The Carbon
Copy Software provided to Licensee includes both a web-based and Windows utility
of the product. The purchase of a node entitles Licensee to select and install
only one version of the product for each computer used by Licensee as described
below. If Licensee desires to install both versions, Licensee must purchase an
additional node for each version installed on each computer. Installation and
use by Licensee of both versions of the product without purchasing additional
nodes to cover the use of both versions is a violation of the License.

(A)    In the case of Carbon Copy web-based solution Software, a "node" is the
same as described in section 7 .d. (Node License - Other Software) above. (B) In
the case of Carbon Copy Software, a "node" is the computer on which the console
component or the client component of the Software is installed. Under this Node
License, Licensee may install and use the console and client components of the
Software in any combination on multiple computers as long as Licensee's
concurrent use of such Software components does not exceed (in the aggregate)
the total number of nodes for which Licensee has purchased licenses (e.g., if
Licensee has purchased 1000 licenses, Licensee may install and use up to, but no
more than, a combined total of 1000 console and client components on multiple
computers at any one time).

(iii)  Web Admin for SMS (Microsoft Systems Management Server). In the case of
Web Admin Software, a "node" is a computer or any other object that populates
the SMS database, such as a printer, copier, etc. (each, an "object"). Under
this Node License, Licensee may use the Software to manage any number of objects
in the SMS database not to exceed at any one time the total number of nodes for
which licenses have been purchased (e.g., if Licensee has purchased 1,000
licenses, Licensee may manage up to, but no more than, 1000 objects in the SMS
database at any one time).

e.     Technician and Consultant Licenses. Technician and Consultant Licenses
are sold on a "per-individual" basis. The Certificate of License will generally
indicate the name of the individual who may use the Software. Each such license
is restricted to a single individual (the "technician" or "consultant") who is
an employee or independent contractor of Licensee, and may not be transferred to
or shared with any other individual. Licensee guarantees the technician's
compliance with this License. Use of the Software is limited to use by the
technician (if an employee) within his/her scope of employment with Licensee, or
use by the technician (if an independent contractor) within the scope of his/her
services for Licensee. Any limit on the number of nodes consumed by the
technician's use of a Software product will be specified in the Certificate of
License. For each such license, the number of managed computers that can be
imaged concurrently using the Multicast feature is limited to the number of
computers specified in the Certificate of License (this only applies to Software
products having the Multicast feature). One Technician or Consultant License
must be purchased for each technician involved in setting up, installing,
imaging or configuring any managed computers. The computers on which the
licensed technician uses the Software are Licensed Computers. Technician and
Consultant Licenses do not allow any element of the software to be "left behind"
on the Licensed Computers once the configuration tasks have been completed.

f.     Site License - Site Licenses are sold on a "per site" basis. Each Site
License allows the Licensee to use the Software on computers at a single,
contiguous, physical location (the "Licensed Site"), but not on any other
computers or at any other site. A separate Site License is required for each
site. The Licensed Site will be designated in the Certificate of License and/or
information about box. Any number of nodes can be consumed under a Site License,
provided that all such nodes (i.e., managed computers) remain at the Licensed
