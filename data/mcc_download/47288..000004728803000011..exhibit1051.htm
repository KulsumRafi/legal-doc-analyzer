<P ALIGN=CENTER><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>INDEMNIFCATION AGREEMENT </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AGREEMENT
made as of this 19<SUP>th</SUP> day of November 2002 by and between HIBERNIA CORPORATION,
a Louisiana corporation (the &#147;Corporation&#148;), and &laquo;Name&raquo;
(&#147;Indemnitee&#148;). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
the Indemnitee is an Authorized Representative of the Corporation, as &#147;Authorized
Representative&#148; is defined in Section 1 hereof; and </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
the Articles of Incorporation, as amended, of the Corporation (the &#147;Articles&#148;)
and the indemnification provisions of the Louisiana Business Corporation Law (the
&#147;Statute&#148;) specifically provide that the indemnification and advancement of
expenses provided by the Articles and the Statute or any other provision of law are not
exclusive of any other rights to which any person may be entitled under any agreement and
thus contemplate that agreements may be entered into with respect to indemnification and
advancement of expenses; and </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
the Articles and the Statute permit the Corporation to purchase and maintain insurance on
behalf of Authorized Representatives of the Corporation against any liability asserted
against and incurred by such persons; and </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
recent developments with respect to the availability of such insurance at reasonable cost
and the terms on which it may be procured have raised uncertainties concerning the
adequacy and reliability of the protection afforded thereby; and </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
the Board of Directors of the Corporation, based upon its business experience, has
concluded that the continuation of present trends in litigation against corporate
directors, officers and employees may make it more difficult for the Corporation to
attract and retain directors, officers and other employees of the highest degree of
competence committed to the active and effective direction and supervision of the business
and affairs of the Corporation and its subsidiaries and affiliates and the operation of
its and their facilities, and the Board of Directors deems such consequences to be so
detrimental to the best interests of the Corporation and its shareholders that it has
concluded that the Corporation should act to provide certain of its Authorized
Representatives with enhanced protection against inordinate risks attendant on their
positions in order to assure that the most capable persons otherwise available will be
attracted to such positions and, in such connection, the Board of Directors has further
concluded that it is not only reasonable and prudent but necessary for the Corporation to
obligate itself contractually to indemnify to the extent provided herein certain of its
Authorized Representatives and to assume financial responsibility for Expenses and
Liabilities (as defined in Section 2 hereof) which might be incurred by such Authorized
Representatives in connection with claims lodged against them for their decisions and
actions as Authorized Representatives; and </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
in order to ameliorate the uncertainties and provide the protection hereinabove referred
to and to induce Indemnitee to continue to serve the Corporation, the Corporation has
determined it to be in its interest to enter into this Agreement with Indemnitee; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW
THEREFORE, in consideration of Indemnitee&#146;s continued service to the Corporation
after the date hereof, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound hereby, agree as
follows: </FONT></P>

     <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          <B>Authorized Representative</B>.<B> </B>For the purposes of this Agreement, the
          term &#147;Authorized Representative&#148; shall mean a director or officer of
          the Corporation; a person serving at the request of the Corporation as a
          director, officer, employee, fiduciary or other representative of another
          corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other
          entity; and any other person designated by or pursuant to authority delegated by
          the Board of Directors of the Corporation as entitled to the benefit of the
          indemnification provisions of the Corporation&#146;s Articles or By-Laws or of
          an indemnification agreement similar to this Agreement. </FONT></P>

     <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          <B>Indemnity</B>. Except as provided in Section 6 hereof, the Corporation shall
          hold harmless and indemnify Indemnitee against all Expenses and Liabilities (as
          those terms are hereinafter defined) incurred by Indemnitee in connection with
          any actual or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding, whether civil,
          criminal, administrative, investigative or other (any such claim, action, suit
          or proceeding being hereinafter referred to as an &#147;Action&#148;), whether
          brought by or in the right of the Corporation or otherwise, in which Indemnitee
          may be involved as a party (or potential party), as a witness or otherwise by
          reason of the fact that Indemnitee was or is an Authorized Representative of the
          Corporation, either as to action in Indemnitee&#146;s official capacity or as to
          action in another capacity while holding such official capacity.<B> </B>As used
          herein, the term &#147;Expenses&#148; includes fees and expenses of counsel
          selected by Indemnitee and the term &#147;Liabilities&#148; includes amounts of
          judgments, fines, excise taxes, penalties and amounts paid in settlement. </FONT></P>

     <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          <B>Advancement of Expenses</B>. Except as provided in Section 6 hereof, subject
          to the obligations of Indemnitee set forth in Section 10(b) hereof, upon request
          by Indemnitee the Corporation shall pay in advance all Expenses incurred or
          payable by Indemnitee by reason of Indemnitee&#146;s participation in an Action
          in advance of the final disposition of such Action. If a written request for
          advancement of Expenses that is required to be paid under this Agreement is not
          paid in full by the Corporation within thirty days after receipt thereof by the
          Corporation, the Corporation hereby confesses judgment and, to the extent
          necessary, empowers any attorney of any court of competent jurisdiction to
          appear for the Corporation and to confess judgment as often as necessary against
          the Corporation in favor of Indemnitee, for the amount of the advancement of
          Expenses so requested by Indemnitee, together with costs of suit and an
          attorney&#146;s commission of 15%. Any amount recovered by Indemnitee pursuant
          to such confession of judgment shall be subject to the obligations of Indemnitee
          set forth in Section 10(b) hereof. Notwithstanding a determination that a
          request for advancement of Expenses is not required to be paid under this
          Agreement, such Expenses may still be subject to reimbursement under Section 2
          hereof. </FONT></P>

     <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          <B>Right of Indemnitee to Indemnification Upon Application</B>. Any
          indemnification under Section 2 hereof or advance of Expenses under Section 3
          hereof that is required to be paid under this Agreement shall be made no later
          than thirty days after receipt by the Corporation of a written request from
          Indemnitee. If such a request is not paid in full by the Corporation within such
          thirty-day period, Indemnitee may at any time thereafter bring suit against the
          Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim and, if successful in
          whole or in part, the Indemnitee shall also be entitled to be paid for his or
          her Expenses incurred in bringing and pursuing such suit. It shall be a defense
          to any such suit to recover a claim for indemnification under Section 2 hereof
          that Indemnitee&#146;s conduct was such that under applicable state or federal
          law, rule, regulation or order,<B> </B>the Corporation is prohibited from
          indemnifying the Indemnitee for the amount claimed, but the burden of proving
          such defense shall be on the Corporation. The preceding sentence shall not
          preclude the Corporation from raising other defenses available to it to any such
          suit. </FONT></P>

               If any change after the date of this Agreement in any applicable law, statute or

          indemnification provided in Sections 2 and 3 hereof may not be paid to

          of any actual or threatened Action in which the Corporation is jointly liable
          with Indemnitee (or would be if joined in such Action) the Corporation shall
          contribute to the amount of Expenses and Liabilities incurred by Indemnitee in

          hand, in connection with the events which resulted in such Expenses or

          Representatives, agents, employees and other representatives, on the one hand,

          information and opportunity to correct or prevent the circumstances resulting in
          such Expenses and Liabilities. The Corporation agrees that it would not be just
          and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by pro

          <B>Defense of Claim</B>. If any Action asserted or commenced against Indemnitee

          entitled to participate therein at its own expense and, except as otherwise
          provided herein below, to the extent that it may wish, the Corporation shall be
          entitled to assume the defense thereof. After notice from the Corporation to
          Indemnitee of its election to assume the defense of any such Action, Indemnitee
          shall have the right to employ Indemnitee&#146;s own counsel in such Action, but
          the fees and expenses of such counsel incurred after notice from the Corporation
          to Indemnitee of its assumption of the defense thereof shall be at the expense
          of Indemnitee, and the Corporation shall not be obligated to Indemnitee under
          this Agreement for any expenses subsequently incurred by Indemnitee in
          connection therewith other than reasonable costs of investigation and travel and
          lodging expenses arising out of Indemnitee&#146;s participation in the defense
          of such Action, unless (i) otherwise authorized by the Corporation, (ii)
          Indemnitee&#146;s counsel shall have reasonably concluded, and so notified the
          Corporation, that there may be a conflict of interest between the Corporation
          and Indemnitee in the conduct of the defense of such Action or (iii) the
          Corporation shall not in fact have employed counsel to assume the defense of
          such Action, in any of which cases the Expenses of Indemnitee in such Action
          shall be advanced by the Corporation to the extent required under this
          Agreement. The Corporation shall not be entitled to assume the defense of any
          Action brought by or on behalf of the Corporation by its shareholders or as to
          which Indemnitee&#146;s counsel shall have made the conclusion set forth in
          clause (ii) of the preceding sentence of this Section 11. </FONT></P>

AGREEMENT </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AGREEMENT
made as of this 19th day of April, 1988, by and between HIBERNIA CORPORATION, a Louisiana
corporation (the &#147;Corporation&#148;), and ______________ (&#147;Indemnitee&#148;). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
the Indemnitee is an Authorized Representative of the Corporation, as &#147;Authorized
Representative&#148; is defined in Section 1 hereof; and </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
the Articles of Incorporation, as amended, of the Corporation (the &#147;Articles&#148;)
and the indemnification provisions of the Louisiana Business Corporation Law (the
&#147;Statute&#148;) specifically provide that the indemnification and advancement of
expenses provided by the Articles and the Statute or any other provision of law are not
exclusive of any other rights to which any person may be entitled under any agreement and
thus contemplate that agreements may be entered into with respect to indemnification and
advancement of expenses; and </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
the Articles and the Statute permit the Corporation to purchase and maintain insurance on
behalf of Authorized Representatives of the Corporation against any liability asserted
against and incurred by such persons; and </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
recent developments with respect to the availability of such insurance at reasonable cost
and the terms on which it may be procured have raised uncertainties concerning the
adequacy and reliability of the protection afforded thereby; and </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
the Board of Directors of the Corporation, based upon its business experience, has
concluded that the continuation of present trends in litigation against corporate
directors, officers and employees may make it more difficult for the Corporation to
attract and retain directors, officers and other employees of the highest degree of
competence committed to the active and effective direction and supervision of the business
and affairs of the Corporation and its subsidiaries and affiliates and the operation of
its and their facilities, and the Board of Directors deems such consequences to be so
detrimental to the best interests of the Corporation and its shareholders that it has
concluded that the Corporation should act to provide certain of its Authorized
Representatives with enhanced protection against inordinate risks attendant on their
positions in order to assure that the most capable persons otherwise available will be
attracted to such positions and, in such connection, the Board of Directors has further
concluded that it is not only reasonable and prudent but necessary for the Corporation to
obligate itself contractually to indemnify to the extent provided herein certain of its
Authorized Representatives and to assume financial responsibility for Expenses and
Liabilities (as defined in Section 2 hereof) which might be incurred by such Authorized
Representatives in connection with claims lodged against them for their decisions and
actions as Authorized Representatives; and </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
in order to ameliorate the uncertainties and provide the protection hereinabove referred
to and to induce Indemnitee to continue to serve the Corporation, the Corporation has
determined it to be in its interest to enter into this Agreement with Indemnitee; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW
THEREFORE, in consideration of Indemnitee&#146;s continued service to the Corporation
after the date hereof, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound hereby, agree as
follows: </FONT></P>

     <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          Authorized Representative. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term
          &#147;Authorized Representative&#148; shall mean a director or officer of the
          Corporation; a person serving at the request of the Corporation as a director,
          officer, employee, fiduciary or other representative of another corporation,
          partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other entity; and
          any other person designated by or pursuant to authority delegated by the Board
          of Directors of the Corporation as entitled to the benefit of the
          indemnification provisions of the Corporation&#146;s Articles or By-Laws or of
          an indemnification agreement similar to this Agreement. </FONT></P>

     <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          Indemnity. Except as provided in Section 6 hereof, the Corporation shall hold
          harmless and indemnify Indemnitee against all Expenses and Liabilities (as those
          terms are hereinafter defined) incurred by Indemnitee in connection with any
          actual or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
          administrative, investigative or other (any such claim, action, suit or
          proceeding being hereinafter referred to as an &#147;Action&#148;), whether
          brought by or in the right of the Corporation or otherwise, in which Indemnitee
          may be involved as a party (or potential party), as a witness or otherwise by
          reason of the fact that Indemnitee was or is an Authorized Representative of the
          Corporation, either as to action in Indemnitee&#146;s official capacity or as to
          action in another capacity while holding such official capacity. As used herein,
          the term &#147;Expenses&#148; includes fees and expenses of counsel selected by
          Indemnitee and the term &#147;Liabilities&#148; includes amounts of judgments,
          fines, excise taxes, penalties and amounts paid in settlement. </FONT></P>

     <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          Advancement of Expenses. Subject to the obligations of Indemnitee set forth in
          Section 10(b) hereof, upon request by Indemnitee the Corporation shall pay in
          advance all Expenses incurred or payable by Indemnitee by reason of
          Indemnitee&#146;s participation in an Action in advance of the final disposition
          of such Action. If a written request for advancement of Expenses is not paid in
          full by the Corporation within thirty days after receipt thereof by the
          Corporation, the Corporation hereby confesses judgment and, to the extent
          necessary, empowers any attorney of any court of competent jurisdiction to
          appear for the Corporation and to confess judgment as often as necessary against
          the Corporation in favor of Indemnitee, for the amount of the advancement of
          Expenses so requested by Indemnitee, together with costs of suit and an
          attorney&#146;s commission of 15%. Any amount recovered by Indemnitee pursuant
          to such confession of judgment shall be subject to the obligations of Indemnitee
          set forth in Section 10(b) hereof. </FONT></P>

     <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          Right of Indemnitee to Indemnification Upon Application. Any indemnification
          under Section 2 hereof or advance of Expenses under Section 3 hereof shall be
          made no later than thirty days after receipt by the Corporation of a written
          request from Indemnitee. If such a request is not paid in full by the
          Corporation within such thirty-day period, Indemnitee may at any time thereafter
          bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim
          and, if successful in whole or in part, the Indemnitee shall also be entitled to
          be paid for his or her Expenses incurred in bringing pursuing such suit. It
          shall be a defense to any such suit to recover a claim for indemnification under
          Section 2 hereof that Indemnitee&#146;s conduct was such that under Louisiana
          law the Corporation is prohibited from indemnifying the Indemnitee for the
          amount claimed, but the burden of proving such defense shall be on the
          Corporation. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its Board of
          Directors, independent legal counsel and its shareholders) to have made a
          determination prior to the commencement of such suit for indemnification that
          indemnification is proper in the circumstances, nor an actual determination by
          the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel or
          its shareholders) that Indemnitee&#146;s conduct was such that indemnification
          is prohibited by law, shall be a defense to the suit for indemnification or
          create a presumption that the Indemnitee&#146;s conduct was such that
          indemnification is prohibited by law. </FONT></P>

          Contribution. If the full indemnification provided in Sections 2 and 3 hereof
          may not be paid to Indemnitee because of the exclusion in Section 6(a)(i)
          hereof, then in respect of any actual or threatened Action in which the

          Action) the Corporation shall contribute to the amount of Expenses and
          Liabilities incurred by Indemnitee in such proportion as is appropriate to
          reflect (i) the relative benefits received by the Corporation on the one hand
          and Indemnitee on the other hand from the transaction from which such Action
          arose and (ii) the relative fault of the Corporation, including its other

          one hand, and of Indemnitee, on the other hand, in connection with the events
          which resulted in such Expenses or Liabilities, as well as any other relevant

          other Authorized Representatives, agents, employees and other representatives,
          on the one hand, and of Indemnitee, on the other hand, shall be determined by
          reference to, among other things, the parties&#146; relative intent, knowledge,
          access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent the circumstances
          resulting in such Expenses and Liabilities. The Corporation agrees that it would
          not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were
          determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does
          not take account of the foregoing equitable considerations. </FONT></P>
