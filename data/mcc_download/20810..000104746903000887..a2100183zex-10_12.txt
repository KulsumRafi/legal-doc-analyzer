                        (i)     Select from among the Employees or Consultants
                        (including those to whom Options have been previously

<Page>

                        (ii)    Determine the number of shares to be subject to
                        such Options granted to such Employees or Consultants,
                        and determine whether such Options are to be Incentive
                        Stock Options or Non-Qualified Stock Options; and

                        (iii)   Determine the terms and conditions of such

                the Company to issue such Option and may impose such conditions
                on the grant of such Option as it deems appropriate. Without
                limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, the Committee
                may require as a condition to the grant of an Option to an
                Employee or Consultant that the Employee or Consultant surrender
                for cancellation some or all of the unexercised Options which
                have been previously granted to him or her. An Option the grant

                condition of the surrendered Option.

        SECTION 3.4     GRANTING OF OPTION TO INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS

                (a)     The Board shall from time to time:

                        (i)     Select from among the Independent Directors
                        (including those to whom Options have previously been
                        granted under the Plan) such of them as in its opinion
                        should be granted Options;

                        (ii)    Determine the number of shares to be subject to
                        such Options granted to such selected Independent
                        Directors; and

                        (iii)   Determine the terms and conditions of such
                        Options, consistent with the Plan; provided, however,
                        that all Options granted to Independent Directors shall
                        be Non-Qualified Stock Options.

                (b)     Upon the selection of an Independent Director to be
                granted an Option pursuant to Section 3.4(a), the Board shall
                instruct the Secretary or another authorized officer of the
                Company to issue such Option and may impose such conditions on
                the grant of such Option as it deems appropriate. Without
                limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, the Board may
                require as a condition to the grant of an Option to an
                Independent Director that the Independent Director surrender for
                cancellation some or all of the unexercised Options which have
                been previously granted to him or her. An Option the grant of
                which is conditioned upon such surrender may have an Option
                price lower (or higher) than the Option price of the surrendered
                Option, may cover the same (or a lesser or greater)

                                        6
<Page>

                number of shares as the surrendered Option, may contain such
                other terms as the Board deems appropriate and shall be
                exercisable in accordance with its terms, without regard to the
                number of shares, price, period of exercisability or any other
                term or condition of the surrendered Option.

                                   ARTICLE IV.
                                TERMS OF OPTIONS

        SECTION 4.1     STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT

        Each Option shall be evidenced by a written Stock Option Agreement,
which shall be executed by the Optionee and an authorized Officer of the Company
and which shall contain such terms and conditions as the Committee (or the
Board, in the case of Options granted to Independent Directors) shall determine,
consistent with the Plan. Stock Option Agreements evidencing Incentive Stock
Options shall contain such terms and conditions as may be necessary to qualify
such Options as "incentive stock options" under Section 422 of the Code.

        SECTION 4.2     EXERCISABILITY OF OPTIONS

                (a)     Each Option shall become exercisable according to the
                terms of the applicable Stock Option Agreement; provided,
                however, that by a resolution adopted after an Option is granted
                the Committee (or the Board, in the case of Options granted to
                Independent Directors) may, on such terms and conditions as it
                may determine to be appropriate, accelerate the time at which
                such Option or any portion thereof may be exercised.

                (b)     Except as otherwise provided in the applicable Stock
                Option Agreement, no portion of an Option which is unexercisable
                at Termination of Employment, Termination of Directorship or
                Termination of Consultancy, as applicable, shall thereafter
                become exercisable.

                (c)     To the extent that the aggregate fair market value of
                stock with respect to which "incentive stock options" (within
                the meaning of Section 422 of the Code, but without regard to
                Section 422(d) of the Code) are exercisable for the first time
                by an Optionee during any calendar year (under the Plan and all
                other incentive stock option plans of the Company or any
                Subsidiary thereof) exceeds $100,000, such options shall be
                treated and taxable as Non-Qualified Stock Options. The rule set
                forth in the preceding sentence shall be applied by taking
                options into account in the order in which they were granted,
                and the stock issued upon exercise of options shall designate
                whether such stock was acquired upon exercise of an Incentive
                Stock Option. For purposes of these rules, the fair market value
                of stock shall be determined as of the date of grant of the
                Option granted with respect to such stock.

        SECTION 4.3     OPTION PRICE

                (a)     The price of the shares subject to each Option shall be
                set by the Committee (or the Board, in the case of Options
                granted to Independent

                                        7
<Page>

                Directors); provided, however, that in the case of an Incentive
                Stock Option, the price per share shall be not less than 100% of
                the fair market value of such shares on the date such Option is
                granted; and that in the case of an individual then owning
                (within the meaning of Section 424(d) of the Code) more than 10%
                of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of
                the Company, the price per share shall not be less than 110% of
                the fair market value of such shares on the date such Incentive
                Stock Option is granted.

                (b)     For purposes of the Plan, the fair market value of a
                share of Common Stock as of a given date shall be:

                        (i)     if the Common Stock is listed on one or more
                        National Securities Exchanges (within the meaning of the
                        Exchange Act), each share of Common Stock shall be
                        valued at the average closing price of a share of such
                        class of Common Stock on the principal exchange on which
                        such shares are then trading, on the twenty trading days
                        immediately preceding such date;

                        (ii)    if the Common Stock is not traded on a National
                        Securities Exchange but is quoted on NASDAQ or a
                        successor quotation system and the Common Stock is
                        listed as a National Market Issue under the NASD
                        National Market System, each share of Common Stock shall
                        be valued at the average of the last sales price on each
                        of the twenty trading days immediately preceding such
                        date as reported by NASDAQ or such successor quotation
                        system; or

                        (iii)   if the class of Common Stock is not publicly
                        traded on a National Securities Exchange and is not
                        quoted on NASDAQ or a successor quotation system, the
                        fair market value of the Common Stock shall be
                        determined in good faith by the Committee.

        SECTION 4.4     EXPIRATION OF OPTIONS

        SECTION 5.1     PERSON ELIGIBLE TO EXERCISE

        During the lifetime of the Optionee, only he or she may exercise an
Option (or any portion thereof granted to him or her; provided, however, that
the Optionee's Eligible Representative may exercise his or her Option during the
period of the Optionee's disability (as defined in Section 22(e)(3) of the Code)

Stock Option. After the death of the Optionee, any exercisable portion of an

Eligible Representative.

the exercisable portion of an Option may be exercised in whole or in part;
provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to issue fractional
shares and the Committee (or the Board, in the case of Options granted to
Independent Directors) may, by the terms of the Option, require any partial
exercise to exceed a specified minimum number of shares.

        SECTION 5.3     MANNER OF EXERCISE

or the applicable Stock Option Agreement:

                (a)     Notice in writing signed by the Optionee or his or her
                Eligible Representative, stating that such Option or portion is
                exercised, and specifically stating the number of shares with
                respect to which the Option is being exercised;

                (b)     A copy of the Stockholders Agreement signed by the

                cashier check) for the shares with respect to which such Option
                or portion is thereby exercised; or

                        (i)     With the consent of the Committee (or the Board,

                        shares of Common Stock owned by the Optionee duly
                        endorsed for transfer to the Company; or (B) except with
                        respect to Incentive Stock Options, shares of the Common
                        Stock issuable to the Optionee upon exercise of the

                        Section 4.3(b)) on the date of Option exercise equal to
                        the aggregate Option price of the shares with respect to
                        which such Option or portion is thereby exercised; or

                        (ii)    With the consent of the Committee (or the Board,

                certified or bank cashier or by any other means of payment
                approved by the Committee) of all amounts necessary to satisfy
                any and all federal, state and local tax withholding

                with all applicable provisions of the Securities Act and any
                other federal or state securities laws or regulations. The
                Committee (or the Board, in the case of Options granted to
                Independent Directors) may, in its sole discretion, also take
                whatever additional actions it deems appropriate to effect such
                compliance including, without limitation, placing legends on
                share certificates and issuing stop-transfer orders to transfer
                agents and registrars; and

                stock exchanges on which such class of stock is then listed;

                (b)     The completion of any registration or other
                qualification of such shares under any state or federal law or
                under the rulings or regulations of the Securities and Exchange
                Commission or any other governmental regulatory body, which the
                Committee (or the Board, in the case of Options granted to
                Independent Directors) shall, in its sole discretion, deem
                necessary or advisable;

                (c)     The obtaining of any approval or other clearance from

restriction shall be set forth in the respective Stock Option Agreement and may
be referred to on the certificates evidencing such shares. The Committee may
require the Employee to give the Company prompt notice of any disposition of
shares of stock, acquired by exercise of an Incentive Stock Option, within two
years from the date of granting such Option or one year after the transfer of
such shares to such Employee. The Committee may direct that the certificates

                        CORPORATE EVENTS.

                (a)     Subject to Section 7.1(d), in the event that the
                Committee (or the Board, in the case of Options granted to
                Independent Directors) determines that any dividend or other
                distribution (whether in the form of cash, Common Stock, other

                other similar corporate transaction or event, in the Committee's
                sole discretion (or in the case of Options granted to
                Independent Directors, the Board's sole discretion), affects the

                Committee (or the Board, in the case of Options granted to
                Independent Directors) to be appropriate in order to prevent
                dilution or enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits
                intended to be made available under the Plan or with respect to
                an Option, then the Committee (or the Board, in the case of

                        Options;

                        (iii)   The exercise price with respect to any Option;
                        and

                        (iv)    The financial or other "targets" specified in
                        each Stock Option Agreement for determining the
                        exercisability of Options.

                (b)     Subject to Section 7.1(d) and the terms of outstanding
                Options, upon the occurrence of a Corporate Event, the Committee

                any one or more of the following actions whenever the Committee
                (or the Board, in the case of Options granted to Independent
                Directors) determines that such action is appropriate in order
                to prevent dilution or enlargement of the benefits or potential
                benefits intended to be made available under the Plan or with
                respect to any Option under this Plan, to facilitate such
                Corporate Event or to give effect to such changes in laws,

                        cash, securities, or other property equal to the amount
                        that could have been attained upon the exercise of the
                        vested portion of such Option (and such additional
                        portion of the Option as the Board or Committee may
                        determine) immediately prior to the occurrence of such

                        applicable Stock Option Agreement or by action taken
                        prior to the occurrence of such Corporate Event, that
                        the Option (or any portion thereof) cannot be exercised
                        after such event;

                        (iii)   In its sole discretion, and on such terms and

                        for a specified period of time prior to such Corporate
                        Event, such Option shall be exercisable as to all shares
                        covered thereby or a specified portion of such shares,
                        notwithstanding anything to the contrary in (A) Section
                        4.2; or (B) the provisions of the applicable Stock

                limitations in any Stock Option Agreement as it may deem
                equitable and in the best interests of the Company and its
                Subsidiaries.

                (d)     With respect to Incentive Stock Options, no adjustment
                or action described in this Section 7.1 or in any other
                provision of the Plan shall be authorized to the extent that
                such adjustment or action would cause the Plan to violate
                Section 422(b)(1) of the Code or any successor provisions
                thereto, unless the Committee determines that the Plan and/or
                the Options are not to comply with Section 422(b)(1) of the
                Code. The number of shares of Common Stock subject to any Option
                shall always be rounded up to the next higher whole number.

        SECTION 7.2     OPTIONS NOT TRANSFERABLE

        No Option or interest or right therein or part thereof shall be liable
for the debts, contracts or engagements of the Optionee or his or her successors
in interest or shall be subject to disposition by transfer, alienation,
anticipation, pledge, encumbrance, assignment or any other means whether such
disposition be voluntary or involuntary or by operation of law, by judgment,
levy, attachment, garnishment or any other legal or equitable proceedings
(including bankruptcy), and any attempted disposition thereof shall be null and
void and of no effect; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 7.2 shall
prevent transfers by will or by the applicable laws of descent and distribution.

        SECTION 7.3     AMENDMENT, SUSPENSION OR TERMINATION OF THE PLAN

        The Plan may be wholly or partially amended or otherwise modified,
suspended or terminated at any time or from time to time by the Board or the
Committee. However, without

                                       14

stockholder approval within 12 months before or after such action no action of
the Board or the Committee may, except as provided in Section 7.1, increase any
limit imposed in Section 2.1 on the maximum number of shares which may be issued
on exercise of Options, reduce the minimum Option price requirements of Section
4.3(a), or extend the limit imposed in this Section 7.3 on the period during
which options may be granted. Except as provided by Section 7.1, neither the
amendment, suspension nor termination of the Plan shall, without the consent of
the holder of the Option, alter or impair any rights or obligations under any
Option theretofore granted. No Option may be granted during any period of
suspension nor after termination of the Plan, and in no event may any Option be
granted under this Plan after the expiration of ten years from the date the Plan
is adopted by the Board.

        SECTION 7.4     EFFECT OF PLAN UPON OTHER OPTION AND COMPENSATION PLANS

        The adoption of this Plan shall not affect any other compensation or
incentive plans in effect for the Company or any Subsidiary. Nothing in this
Plan shall be construed to limit the right of the Company or any Subsidiary (a)
to establish any other forms of incentives or compensation for directors,
consultants or employees of the Company (or any Subsidiary); or (b) to grant or
assume options otherwise than under this Plan in connection with any proper
corporate purpose, including, but not by way of limitation, the grant or
assumption of options in connection with the acquisition by purchase, lease,
merger, consolidation or otherwise, of the business, stock or assets of any
corporation, firm or association.

        SECTION 7.5     APPROVAL OF PLAN BY STOCKHOLDERS

        This Plan will be submitted for the approval of the Company's
stockholders within 12 months after the date of the Board's initial adoption of
this Plan and the Plan and the Options granted hereunder will be effective upon
approval by such stockholders as contemplated by Section 280G(b)(5)(A)(ii) of
the Code and regulations thereunder as if a "change in control" occurred
immediately following such approval. No Option may be exercised to any extent by
anyone unless and until the Plan is so approved by the stockholders, and if such
approval has not been obtained by the end of said 12-month period, the Plan and
all Options theretofore granted shall thereupon be canceled and become null and
void.

        SECTION 7.6     TITLES

        Titles are provided herein for convenience only and are not to serve as
a basis for interpretation or construction of the Plan.

        SECTION 7.7     CONFORMITY TO SECURITIES LAWS

        The Plan is intended to conform to the extent necessary with all
provisions of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and any and all
regulations and rules promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission
thereunder to the extent the Company or any Optionee is subject to the
provisions thereof. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Plan
shall be administered, and Options shall be granted and may be exercised, only
in such a manner as to conform to such laws, rules and regulations. To the
extent permitted by applicable law, the Plan and Options granted hereunder shall
be deemed amended to the extent necessary to conform to such laws, rules and
regulations.

        SECTION 7.8     GOVERNING LAW

        To the extent not preempted by federal law, the Plan shall be construed
in accordance with and governed by the laws of the state of Delaware.

        SECTION 7.9     SEVERABILITY

        In the event any portion of the Plan or any action taken pursuant
thereto shall be held illegal or invalid for any reason, the illegality or
invalidity shall not affect the remaining parts of the Plan, and the Plan shall
be construed and enforced as if the illegal or invalid provisions had not been
included, and the illegal or invalid action shall be null and void.
