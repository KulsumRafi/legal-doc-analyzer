9.2   SUBORDINATION UNCONDITIONAL

      Neither the Subordination nor Brightpoint's or the Junior Creditor's
      liability under this document is adversely affected by anything which
      would otherwise prejudice the Subordination or reduce or discharge the
      liability of Brightpoint or Junior Creditor, including:

      (a)   a Creditor granting time or any other indulgence or concession to
            Brightpoint or any other person;

      (b)   a Creditor increasing the amount of, opening further accounts in
            connection with or otherwise varying the type or terms of, financial
            accommodation provided to Brightpoint or any other person;

      (c)   any transaction or agreement, or variation, novation or assignment
            of a transaction or agreement between a Creditor and Brightpoint or
            any other person;

      (d)   the Insolvency of Brightpoint, a Junior Creditor or any other
            person, or a Creditor becoming a party to or bound by any
            Insolvency;

      (e)   any judgment or order being obtained or made against Brightpoint or
            any other person or Brightpoint or other person's conduct of any
            proceedings;

      (f)   an obligation of Brightpoint or a provision of a Transaction
            Document being void, voidable, unenforceable, defective, released,
            waived, impaired, novated, enforced or impossible or illegal to
            perform;

      (g)   the whole or partial discharge or release of, or the granting of, a
            Security Interest or Guarantee in relation to the Debt;

      (h)   any of the Senior Debt or Junior Debt not being recoverable or the
            liability of Brightpoint or any other person to a Creditor ceasing
            (including as a result of a release or discharge by the Creditor or
            by law);

      (i)   the failure of Brightpoint or any other person to execute any
            Transaction Document;

      (j)   the Senior Creditor taking or failing to take a Security Interest or
            Guarantee in connection with the Senior Debt;

      (k)   the failure by the Senior Creditor to give any notice to a Junior
            Creditor, including of a default by Brightpoint or any other person;

      (l)   a Creditor exercising or not exercising its rights (including any
            right to elect to terminate a contract) under any document or at law
            against Brightpoint or any other person;

      (m)   any default, misrepresentation, negligence, breach of contract,
            misconduct, acquiescence, delay, waiver, mistake, failure to give
            notice or other action or inaction of any kind (whether or not
            prejudicial to Brightpoint or Junior Creditor) by a Creditor or any
            other person;

      (n)   any change to, or in the membership of, any partnership, joint
            venture or association; or

      (o)   any property the subject of a Security Interest held as security for
            the Senior Debt being destroyed, forfeited, extinguished,
            surrendered or resumed,

      whether or not Brightpoint or a Creditor is aware of it or consents to it
      and despite any legal rule to the contrary.

9.3   NO COMPETITION

      The Junior Creditor may not (either directly or indirectly) during the
      Subordination Period:


                                                    Subordination deed | page 15
<PAGE>

      (a)   claim or exercise a right of subrogation or a right of contribution
            or claim the benefit of a Security Interest or Guarantee held by or
            on behalf of the Senior Creditor in relation to the Senior Debt; or

      (b)   take any steps to enforce a right or claim against Brightpoint in
            respect of any payment to or benefit received by the Senior Creditor
            under this document.

9.4   PRESERVATION

      (a)   The fact that the Senior Creditor exercises, does not exercise, or
            delays the exercise of, any Power does not affect, or constitute a
            representation in relation to, the Power or any other Power.

      (b)   Without limiting paragraph (a), the fact that the Senior Creditor
            exercises a Power does not prevent the Senior Creditor from
            exercising that Power again.

      (c)   Unless expressly provided in a Transaction Document, no Power nor
            any Transaction Document merges in, adversely affects or is
            adversely affected by any other Power or Transaction Document or any
            Security Interest, judgment or remedy which the Senior Creditor (or
            anyone claiming through it) may have or obtain.

9.5   NO OBLIGATION TO EXERCISE RIGHTS OR GIVE CONSENT

      Except as set out in this agreement, the Senior Creditor may:

      (a)   exercise or not exercise any Power;

      (b)   give or not give its consent; and

      (c)   make or not make a decision,

      under a Transaction Document in its absolute discretion unless a
      Transaction Document expressly provides otherwise. The Senior Creditor
      must give reasons to the Junior Creditor for any of its actions or
      inactions covered by this clause. A consent given by the Senior Creditor
      subject to conditions does not take effect until the conditions are
      complied with to the satisfaction of the Senior Creditor.

9.6   POWERS

      (a)   The Senior Creditor's Powers provided by the Transaction Documents
            are cumulative and not exclusive of any other rights, powers,
            discretions or remedies provided by law.

      (b)   Where a Power under the Transaction Documents is inconsistent with a
            Power at law, the Transaction Documents prevail to the extent
            permitted by law. A Power at law is not inconsistent with the
            Transaction Documents merely because it is more extensive than a
            similar Power in the Transaction Documents or because there is no
            similar Power in the Transaction Documents.

9.7   CHOICE OF SECURITIES AND GUARANTEES

      The Senior Creditor need not resort to any Security Interest, Guarantee or
      any other Power before resorting to any other of them.

9.8   INDEMNITIES GENERALLY

      (a)   Each indemnity given to the Senior Creditor in the Transaction
            Documents:

            (i)   is absolute and unconditional;

            (ii)  is a continuing obligation despite any settlement of account
                  or the occurrence of any other thing;


                                                    Subordination deed | page 16
<PAGE>

            (iii) must be discharged without set-off, deduction, abatement,
                  counterclaim, suspension or deferment;

            (iv)  constitutes a separate and independent obligation of the party
                  giving the indemnity from its other obligations under the
                  Transaction Documents; and

            (v)   survives termination of any Transaction Document.

      (b)   It is not necessary for the Senior Creditor to incur an expense or
            make a payment before enforcing a right of indemnity conferred by a
            Transaction Document.

9.9   CONSENT AND WAIVERS

      A consent or waiver by the Senior Creditor is effective only if in
      writing.

10.   Other provisions

10.1  PERPETUITY PERIOD

      The perpetuity period for any trust in this document is 80 years or the
      Subordination Period, whichever is shorter.

10.2  PROTECTION OF CREDITOR AND ATTORNEY

      To the extent permitted by law, neither the Senior Creditor nor any
      Attorney is liable in relation to any act or omission on its part in the
      exercise or non-exercise of any Power (including any negligence or breach
      of duty) nor for any resulting Loss, except where the Senior Creditor or
      Attorney has been reckless or fraudulent.

10.3  NOTIFICATION FROM BRIGHTPOINT OR JUNIOR CREDITOR

      If Brightpoint or the Junior Creditor is required under this document to
      notify the Senior Creditor about anything, it must do so in writing.

10.4  SENIOR CREDITOR MAY SET OFF

      Without any demand or notice, the Senior Creditor may, if an Event of
      Default is subsisting, set off and apply indebtedness it owes to the
      Junior Creditor (whatever the currency) against any money owing to it by
      the Junior Creditor under any Transaction Document:

      (a)   whether the amount owed by the Senior Creditor or the Junior
            Creditor is owed by it alone or with any other person; and

      (b)   whether or not the amount owed by the Senior Creditor or the Junior
            Creditor is immediately payable.

      The Junior Creditor irrevocably authorises the Senior Creditor to do
      anything necessary (including to sign any document and effect appropriate
      currency exchanges) for that purpose.

10.5  JUNIOR CREDITOR MAY NOT SET OFF

      The Junior Creditor may not (either directly or indirectly) claim,
      exercise or attempt to exercise a right of set-off or counterclaim against
      the Senior Creditor (whether the right is the Junior Creditor's or any
      other person's) or any other right which might have the effect of reducing
      the amount payable by the Junior Creditor under this document.

10.6 NOTICES OR DEMANDS AS EVIDENCE

      A notice or certificate from or demand by the Senior Creditor:

      (a)   that a specified sum of money is owing or payable under a
            Transaction Document;


                                                    Subordination deed | page 17
<PAGE>

      (b)   that an Event of Default has occurred; or

      (c)   any other fact or determination relevant to the rights or
            obligations of the Senior Creditor, the Junior Creditor or
            Brightpoint under a Transaction Document,

      is taken to be prima facie evidence that that sum is owing or payable
      unless the contrary is proved.

10.7  SEVERABILITY

      (a)   A construction of this document that results in all provisions being
            enforceable and effective is to be preferred to a construction that
            does not.

      (b)   If, despite the application of paragraph (a), a provision of this
            document is illegal, unenforceable or ineffective, then the
            provision will be inoperative, but only to the extent to which, and
            during such time as, it is illegal, unenforceable or ineffective and
            the remainder of this document will continue in force.

      (c)   To the extent permitted by law, Brightpoint and the Junior Creditor
            will use its best endeavours (including by obtaining any necessary
            Authorisation) to include within the scope of clause 2 any
            obligation which is within the scope of the definition of Debt but
            with respect to which that clause is deemed inoperative under
            paragraph (b).

10.8  VARIATION OF AGREEMENT

      A variation of this document must be in writing and signed by or on behalf
      of each party to it.

10.9  AUTHORISED OFFICERS AND COMMUNICATIONS

      Brightpoint and Junior Creditor irrevocably authorises the Senior Creditor
      to rely on:

      (a)   a certificate by any person purporting to be a director or secretary
            of Brightpoint or the Junior Creditor (as the case may be) as to the
            identity and signatures of its Authorised Officers. Brightpoint or
            the Junior Creditor (as the case may be) warrants that those persons
            have been authorised to give notices and communications under or in
            connection with this document; and

      (b)   any notice or other document contemplated by this document which
            bears the purported signature (whether given by facsimile or
            otherwise) of an Authorised Officer of Brightpoint or the Junior
            Creditor (as the case may be).

10.10 SENIOR CREDITOR MAY ASSIGN RIGHTS

      (a)   Subject to the Transaction Documents, the Senior Creditor may assign
            its rights under this document without the consent of Brightpoint or
            the Junior Creditor. If it does so, the Senior Debt will include all
            liabilities of Brightpoint to the assignee which are within the
            scope of the definition whether or not the liabilities arose or were
            contemplated before the date of the assignment.

      (b)   Subject to the Transaction Documents, the Senior Creditor may
            disclose to a potential assignee any confidential information
            provided to the Senior Creditor by Brightpoint or the Junior
            Creditor.

10.11 JUNIOR CREDITOR MAY NOT ASSIGN RIGHTS

      A Junior Creditor may not assign its rights under this document.

10.12 GOVERNING LAW, JURISDICTION AND SERVICE OF PROCESS

      (a)   This document is governed by the laws of New South Wales.

      (b)   Each party irrevocably and unconditionally submits to the
            non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of New South Wales. Each
            party waives any right it has to object to an action


                                                    Subordination deed | page 18
<PAGE>

            being brought in those courts, including by claiming that the action
            has been brought in an inconvenient forum or that those courts do
            not have jurisdiction.

      (c)   Without preventing any other mode of service, any document in an
            action or process may be served on any party by being delivered to
            or left for that party at its address for service of notices under
            this document.

      (d)   The Junior Creditor appoints Brightpoint as its agent to accept
            service of process under or in connection with this document.
            Brightpoint accepts this appointment.

10.13 ATTORNEYS

      Each attorney signing this document under a power of attorney certifies,
      by the attorney's signature, that the attorney has no notice of the
      revocation of the power of attorney.

10.14 COUNTERPARTS

      This document may be executed in any number of counterparts.

GENERAL TERMS

INTERPRETATION

Definitions of terms printed like this are at the end of these General Terms
before the Schedules.

1.    THE FACILITY

PROVISION OF THE FACILITY

1.1   GE Capital agrees to provide the company with the facility (including the
      receivables facility) in Australian Dollars of an amount not exceeding the
      facility limit. The facility limit is an overall collective limit which
      includes the receivables facility and the letter of credit facility.

RECEIVABLES FACILITY

1.2   The Company may make offers to sell its debts to GE Capital and GE Capital
      may purchase the debts from the company together with all incidental
      rights, benefits and remedies attaching to the debts. The offers to sell
      its debts made by the company to GE Capital must be in a form stipulated
      by GE Capital from time to time and must contain the information required
      by GE Capital. The offer of sale must identify the debts offered for sale
      by reference to the date, the debtor, the amount of the debt and the
      invoice number or other reference for each of the debts.

1.3   The consideration for the purchase of the debts is the sale price.

1.4   GE Capital may only accept an offer of sale by payment of the sale price
      to the Company in the manner set out in clause 1.5.

1.5   If GE Capital wishes to purchase the debts contained in an offer of sale,
      GE Capital will pay the company for the debts by crediting the sale
      account with the sale price. Title to the assigned debts passes to GE
      Capital on the purchase date.

1.6   Any offer of sale made by the company shall not be capable of acceptance
      by GE Capital in writing.

1.7   The right, title and interest of the company in, to and under the debts
      passes to GE Capital free from all encumbrances upon acceptance of an
      offer of sale.

1.8   Within 14 days of the acceptance of an offer of sale, the company shall
      deliver to GE Capital if requested by GE Capital a copy of the company's
      invoices relating to the debts together with the terms and conditions of
      each of the debts.

2.    USING THE FACILITY

DRAWINGS

2.1   The company need not use the facility. However, if the company wants to
      use the facility, including by drawing on the funds from the sale account,
      it may do so by one or more drawings.

REQUESTING A DRAWING

2.2   (a)   If the company wants to make a drawing, including by drawing on the
            funds from the sale account, the company agrees to give a drawdown
            notice signed by an authorised officer of the company to GE Capital
            by noon on the business day it wants the drawing and GE Capital
            agrees to compare the signature of the authorised officer on the
            drawdown notice against the specimen signature certificate provided
            to it.

      (b)   GE Capital agrees to use its best endeavours to make available a
            drawing if the drawdown notice is received after noon on the
            business day the company wants the drawing.

EFFECT OF A DRAWDOWN NOTICE

2.3   A drawdown notice is effective when GE Capital actually receives it in
      legible form. An effective drawdown notice is irrevocable.

CONDITIONS TO FIRST DRAWING

2.4   Before the company requests the first drawing, the company must:

      (a)   ensure that GE Capital receives every item listed in Schedule 1 in
            form and substance satisfactory to GE Capital; and

      (b)   ensure that GE Capital receives all other documents required by GE
            Capital to verify the items in Schedule 1 in form and substance
            satisfactory to GE Capital.

      (c)   ensure that the information contained in all transaction documents
            is true, complete and not misleading or deceptive and discloses all
            material matters to GE Capital. Before GE Capital is obliged to
            provide any financial accommodation, it must be satisfied as to
            those matters. GE Capital is entitled to rely on the items in
            Schedule 1 and the information contained in them without further
            enquiry.

2.5   Any transaction document required to be certified must be certified by a
      secretary or a director of the relevant entity as being true, complete as
      at the time of certification and at the date of this agreement.

2.6   GE Capital agrees to notify the company in writing as soon as practicable
      but in any event, no later than two business days after GE Capital is
      satisfied that the conditions to first drawing are satisfied.


                              Page 10 of 84 Pages
<PAGE>

CONDITIONS TO ALL DRAWINGS

2.7   GE Capital need not provide any financial accommodation including allowing
      any drawdown of funds from the sale account unless:

      (a)   it is to be provided or the debts are to be sold prior to the
            maturity date set out in the Details; and

      (b)   GE Capital is satisfied that providing the drawing or the purchase
            of the debts (as the case may be) will not result in a breach of
            clause 3.1; and

      (c)   GE Capital has received a drawdown notice in respect of it; and

      (d)   GE Capital is satisfied that the representations and warranties in
            clause 12 ("Representations and warranties") and the statements in
            the drawdown notice are true, complete and not misleading at the
            date of the drawdown notice and at the drawdown date; and

      (e)   in the case of the receivables facility, GE Capital has received an
            offer of sale in respect of the debts and the statements in the
            offer of sale are correct at the purchase date; and

      (f)   GE Capital is satisfied that no event of default has occurred and
            subsists (other than one which has either been waived by GE Capital
            or remedied) and no event of default would result from the provision
            of the financial accommodation.

BENEFIT OF CONDITIONS

2.8   Each condition precedent to drawing is for the sole benefit of GE Capital
      and may be waived or modified by GE Capital.

LETTERS OF CREDIT

2.9   The provisions set out in Schedule 5 and Schedule 8A apply in relation to
      letters of credit provided or to be provided under this agreement. The
      obligors agree to comply with the provisions set out in those Schedules.

3.    AVAILABILITY LIMITS

3.1   The total of the current drawings and the letter of credit liability at
      any time must not exceed the lesser of:

      (a)   the facility limit; or

      (b)   the aggregate borrowing base at that time.

3.2   If the total of the current drawings and letter of credit liability
      exceeds the limits set out in clause 3.1, the company agrees to
      immediately repay to GE Capital so much of the current drawings or cancel
      or repay a letter of credit equal to the excess of the limits set out in
      clause 3.1.


                              Page 11 of 84 Pages
<PAGE>

4.    INTEREST

INTERPRETATION

4.1   In this clause 4, references to the company in respect of a current
      drawing are references to the company in whose name the current drawing is
      made.

INTEREST CHARGES

4.2   The company agrees to pay interest on the daily balance of each current
      drawing. The interest charge for each day is calculated by applying the
      interest rate to the daily balance of the current drawing on the basis of
      a 360 day year. The interest rate for any day will be determined on the
      first business day of the calendar month in which the day falls.

INTEREST PAYMENT

4.3   On each interest payment date the company agrees to pay GE Capital the
      interest which has accrued from and including the first day of the
      calendar month of the preceding month up to and including the last day of
      that calendar month.

5.    PAYMENTS

REPAYMENT

5.1   The company agrees to pay to GE Capital all money received by and for it
      or on its behalf on account of the assigned debts and all other cash
      receipts, by way of deposit into a controlled account. To the extent not
      already paid, the company agrees to repay to GE Capital the total of the
      current drawings and the total letter of credit liability and the recourse
      amount on the maturity date.

PREPAYMENT

5.2   The company may prepay, without penalty or premium (but subject to clause
      7) a current drawing at any time and from time to time. The facility limit
      is not reduced by the amounts prepaid under this clause 5.2.

MANNER OF PAYMENT

5.3   The obligor agrees to make payments under each transaction document to GE
      Capital on the due date (or, if that is not a business day, on the next
      business day) in Australian dollars in immediately available funds without
      set-off or counterclaim and without any deduction in respect of taxes
      (unless prohibited by law) into the account nominated by GE Capital. The
      obligor satisfies a payment obligation only when GE Capital receives the
      amount.


                              Page 12 of 84 Pages
<PAGE>

PAYMENT APPLICATION

5.4   A payment under a transaction document will be applied by GE Capital on
      the same business day after it is actually received by GE Capital in the
      account nominated by GE Capital only for the purpose of calculating
      interest.

CONVERSION OF CURRENCY

5.5   All payments by the obligors under this agreement must be made in
      Australian dollars. If GE Capital receives an amount in a currency other
      than Australian dollars:

      (a)   it may convert the amount received into Australian dollars (even
            though it may be necessary to convert through a third currency to do
            so) on the day and at the rates (including spot rate, same day value
            rate or value tomorrow rate) as it considers appropriate (acting
            reasonably). It may deduct its usual costs in connection with the
            conversion in calculating the amount payable; and

      (b)   the obligor satisfies its obligation to pay in Australian dollars
            only to the extent of the amount of Australian dollars obtained from
            the conversion after deducting the costs of the conversion.

5.6   Where GE Capital is obliged to make a payment under this agreement in a
      currency other than Australian dollars, the obligor must reimburse GE
      Capital for that payment in Australian dollars unless GE Capital specifies
      otherwise. For the purpose of calculating the amount payable in Australian
      dollars, GE Capital may:

      (a)   convert the amount payable into Australian dollars (even though it
            may be necessary to convert through a third currency to do so) on
            the day and at the rates (including spot rate, same day value rate
            or value tomorrow rate) as it considers appropriate (acting
            reasonably). It may add its usual costs in connection with the
            conversion in calculating the amount payable; and

      (b)   the obligor satisfies its obligation to make any payment under this
            agreement only to the extent that the moneys received by GE Capital
            are sufficient to pay the liability in the other currency including
            the costs of the conversion to that currency.

APPLICATION OF PAYMENTS

5.7   GE Capital will apply amounts paid by the obligor or on its behalf and/or
      to GE Capital from any controlled account, towards:

      (a)   satisfying obligations under the transaction documents in the manner
            GE Capital sees fit, unless the transaction documents expressly
            provide otherwise; and

      (b)   satisfying any money owed by the obligor to any related entity of GE
            Capital.

5.8   If there are no current drawings, no letter of credit liabilities and no
      money payable or to become payable in the future by the obligor to GE
      Capital or any of its related entities, GE Capital will at the written
      direction of the company, apply amounts paid by the obligor or on its
      behalf to an account of the company nominated by the company.


                              Page 13 of 84 Pages
<PAGE>

5.9   Once the facility has terminated (either through the effluxion of time or
      otherwise) and all current drawings and other money due and owing to GE
      Capital have been repaid, GE Capital will promptly direct the bank that
      maintains the blocked account to transfer any credit balance in the
      blocked account to an account nominated by the company.

5.10  The company must repay to GE Capital on the date that one of the following
      events occurs (as reasonably determined by GE Capital) an amount
      calculated as the face value of each of the following assigned debts less
      any amount received by GE Capital in respect of those assigned debts:

      (a)   each assigned debt that has not been paid in full on the recourse
            date;

      (b)   each assigned debt where the debtor claims that it is not obliged to
            repay the assigned debt in whole or in part;

      (c)   each assigned debt where the debtor claims a right of set-off or
            cross-claim against the company in respect of the assigned debt;

      (d)   each assigned debt where the debtor is or may become insolvent in
            the reasonable business opinion of GE Capital;

      (e)   each assigned debt which is uncollectable, unenforceable, invalid or
            may in the opinion of GE Capital be or become repayable to the
            debtor or any external administrator of the debtor for any reason;
            and

      (f)   each assigned debt that is not an eligible account.

5.11  GE Capital must transfer title to the company of assigned debts after
      termination of this agreement provided that no money is owing to GE
      Capital by the debtor, or might become owing in the future in GE Capital's
      reasonable business opinion.

6.    CANCELLATION AND AGENCY

6.1   The company may cancel or terminate the facility. It may do this if the
      company gives GE Capital at least 20 business days notice in writing. Once
      given, the notice is irrevocable. When the cancellation or termination
      takes effect, the total of the current drawings and all other amounts
      payable or to become payable in the future under the transaction documents
      are immediately due and payable including without limitation the early
      termination fee.

6.2   GE Capital appoints the company as its agent in respect of all assigned
      debts including, without limitation, to collect and pursue recovery of all
      assigned debts at the expense of the company.

6.3   The company must collect and receive all money and proceeds paid in
      respect of assigned debts and must pay all money and proceeds generated by
      the assigned debts into the controlled account on the day of receipt
      without set-off or counterclaim and without any deduction in respect of
      taxes unless prohibited by law.

6.4   The company must deal with the money and proceeds of assigned debts
      deposited to the controlled account in accordance with GE Capital's
      instructions. All money and proceeds of assigned debts received by the
      company are to be held on trust for GE


                              Page 14 of 84 Pages
<PAGE>

      Capital and must not be mixed with moneys of the company or paid into any
      account other than the controlled account.

6.5   If, after an event of default occurs and for so long as it subsists, the
      company must direct all debtors to send payments of money owing for
      assigned debts to any address nominated by GE Capital and must endorse on
      all invoices, statements and other requests for payment in respect of any
      assigned debts a direction to send payment in accordance with any
      direction of GE Capital.

6.6   The company must not allow any set-off, release or write-off to occur or
      credit note to be issued in relation to any assigned debt unless, in
      accordance with the company's existing business practices with debtors or
      otherwise, in the company's reasonable business opinion this represents a
      proper monetary recognition of the amount which should be deducted from
      the assigned debt, or the company has obtained GE Capital's consent. The
      Company must not transfer, assign or encumber or purport to do so with any
      assigned debt.

6.7   This agency may be terminated by GE Capital at any time by notice in
      writing to the company and terminates automatically on termination of this
      agreement.

      (a)   the closing fee on the first drawdown date under this agreement;

                              Page 15 of 84 Pages
<PAGE>

      (h)   subject to the other terms of this agreement, the early termination
            fee on the date on which the facility is cancelled or terminated,
            (but only if the facility is cancelled or terminated prior to the
            maturity date) either voluntarily by the company or otherwise.

8.    LOAN ACCOUNT

8.1   GE Capital agrees to maintain a loan account on its books to record:

      (a)   all current drawings;

      (b)   all recourse amounts;

      (c)   all other amounts due and payable by the obligor to GE Capital under
            the transaction documents including but not limited to interest,
            fees and amounts deemed to be current drawings;

      (d)   all payments made by or on behalf of the company or by means of the
            blocked account agreement; and

      (e)   all other debits and credits as provided for in the transaction
            documents.

      The balance in the loan account is prima facie evidence (absent error) of
      the amounts due and owing to GE Capital by the obligors. However, a
      failure to record or an error in recording does not limit or otherwise
      affect an obligor's obligations under the transaction documents.

8.2   GE Capital agrees to provide the company with a monthly statement of
      transactions for the facility. Unless the company notifies GE Capital of
      any objection to any item in that statement (specifically describing the
      basis for the objection), within 60 days after the date of the statement,
      each item in the statement is (absent obvious error) prima facie evidence
      of the correctness of the item.

9.    WITHHOLDING TAX

PAYMENTS TO GE CAPITAL

9.1   If a law requires the obligor to deduct an amount in respect of taxes from
      a payment under any transaction document such that GE Capital would not
      actually receive on the due date the full amount provided for under the
      transaction document, then:

      (a)   the amount payable is increased so that, after making the deduction
            and further deductions applicable to additional amounts payable
            under this clause 9.1, GE Capital is entitled to receive (at the
            time the payment is due) the amount it would have received if no
            deductions had been required; and

      (b)   the obligor agrees to make the deductions; and

      (c)   the obligor agrees to pay the amounts deducted to the relevant
            authority in accordance with applicable law and deliver the copies
            of receipts to GE Capital.

10.   COMPENSATION FOR CHANGED CIRCUMSTANCES

COMPENSATION

10.1  The company agrees to compensate GE Capital within 5 business days of
      receiving a notice from GE Capital if, in GE Capital's opinion, any law or
      change in law taking effect after the date of this agreement, a change in
      any law's interpretation or application by an authority after the date of
      this agreement or compliance by GE Capital or any of its related entities
      with any such law, changed law or changed interpretation or application
      directly:

      (a)   increases the cost of the facility to GE Capital; or

      (b)   reduces any amount received or receivable by GE Capital, or its
            effective return, in connection with the facility; or

      (c)   reduces GE Capital's return on capital allocated to the facility, or
            its overall return on capital.

      Compensation need not be in the form of a lump sum and may be demanded as
      a series of payments.

CALCULATION IN REASONABLE DETAIL

10.2  If GE Capital makes a demand under clause 10.1, it agrees to provide the
      company with reasonably detailed calculations of how the amount demanded
      has been ascertained. However, nothing in this clause 10.2 obliges GE
      Capital to provide details of its business or tax affairs which it
      considers in good faith to be confidential.

MITIGATION

10.3  If requested by the company, in any case where clause 10.1 applies, GE
      Capital will use its reasonable endeavours to take such steps as may be
      reasonable and available to it to minimise the amount of any increased
      cost, reduction, loss of return or payment. Failure by GE Capital to do so
      does not release the company from its obligations under clause 10.1 and
      the company agrees that no right of action arises as a result.

10.4  Nothing in clause 10.3 obliges GE Capital to incur any additional costs or
      to take any steps which, in GE Capital's opinion, could be detrimental to
      its interests, whether by way of an economic, legal or regulatory
      disadvantage or in any other way.

10.5  The company must reimburse GE Capital on demand for any costs incurred in
      taking any steps under clause 10.3.

10.6  The early termination fee is not payable by the company should the
      facility terminate as a consequence of this clause 10 provided no event of
      default has occurred and subsists.

11.   ILLEGALITY OR IMPOSSIBILITY

GE CAPITAL'S RIGHT TO SUSPEND OR CANCEL

11.1  This clause 11 applies if GE Capital determines that:

      (a)   a change in a law; or

      (b)   a change in the interpretation or administration of a law by an
            authority; or

      (c)   a new law taking effect after the date of this agreement,

      makes it (or will make it) illegal or impossible for GE Capital to fund,
      provide, or continue to fund or provide, financial accommodation under the
      transaction documents. In these circumstances, GE Capital, by giving a
      notice to the company, may suspend or cancel some or all of GE Capital's
      obligations under this agreement as indicated in the notice.

EXTENT AND DURATION

11.2  The suspension or cancellation:

      (a)   must apply only to the extent necessary to avoid the illegality or
            impossibility; and

      (b)   in the case of suspension, may continue only for so long as the
            illegality or impossibility continues.

NOTICE REQUIRING REPAYMENT

11.3  If the illegality or impossibility relates to a current drawing, GE
      Capital, by giving a notice to the company, may require repayment of all
      or part of that current drawing. The company agrees to repay the amount
      specified within 5 business days after receiving the notice.

FEES

11.4  The early termination fee is not payable by the company if the early
      repayment occurs solely because of a cancellation or suspension under this
      clause 11, and provided no event of default has occurred and is
      subsisting.

11.5  The unused facility fee is not payable by the company for that part of the
      facility that is cancelled or suspended under this clause, and provided no
      event of default has occurred or occurs, for the period of the suspension
      or cancellation.

            (i)   the negotiation, preparation, execution, stamping and
                  registration of all transaction documents; and

            (ii)  it being satisfied that conditions to drawing have been met;
                  and

            (iii) the general on-going administration of the facility (including
                  giving and considering consents, waivers and releases); and

      (b)   GE Capital's costs in otherwise acting in connection with the
            transaction documents, such as enforcing or preserving rights (or
            considering enforcing or preserving them) or doing anything in
            connection with any enquiry by an authority involving the company or
            any of its related entities; and

      (c)   taxes and fees (including registration fees) and fines and penalties
            in respect of fees paid or that GE Capital reasonably believes are
            payable in connection with any transaction document or a payment or
            receipt or any other transaction contemplated by any transaction
            document or any supply of anything by GE Capital to the company.
            However, the company need not pay a fine or penalty in connection
            with taxes or fees to the extent that it has placed GE Capital in
            sufficient cleared funds for GE Capital to be able to pay the taxes
            or fees by the due date; and

      (d)   if GST has application to any supply made under or in connection
            with this agreement or a transaction document, in addition to any
            other consideration expressed as payable elsewhere in this agreement
            or a transaction document, an additional amount on account of GST,
            such amount to be calculated by multiplying the amount or
            consideration payable by the company for the relevant supply by the
            prevailing GST rate (taking into account any input tax credit
            actually received by GE Capital which in GE Capital's opinion
            relates to a GST payment made in respect of any supply made under or
            in connection with this agreement). Any amount payable on account of
            GST by the company under this clause must be calculated without any
            deduction or set off of any other amount (other than as expressly
            permitted under this clause) and is payable by the company on demand
            by GE Capital whether the demand is by means of an invoice or
            otherwise; and

      (e)   if GE Capital is unable to obtain a full input tax credit for an
            amount paid on account of GST by GE Capital to another person in
            respect of a supply made by another person to GE Capital in respect
            of this agreement or a transaction document or matters arising under
            this agreement or a transaction document, an amount equal to the
            input tax credit to which GE Capital is not entitled under the GST
            legislation.

OTHER LOSS

16.2  The company indemnifies GE Capital from and against any costs, liability
      or loss suffered or incurred by GE Capital arising from, or in connection
      with:

      (a)   any claim made against it by reason of financial accommodation
            requested under a transaction document not being provided in
            accordance with the request for any reason except default of GE
            Capital; and

      (b)   financial accommodation under a transaction document being repaid,
            discharged or made payable other than in accordance with the
            transaction documents; and

      (c)   GE Capital acting in connection with a transaction document in good
            faith on fax or telephone instructions purporting to originate from
            the offices of the company or to be given by an authorised officer
            of the company; and

      (d)   an event of default; and

      (e)   GE Capital exercising or attempting to exercise rights in connection
            with a transaction document after an event of default; and

      (f)   any indemnity GE Capital gives a controller or an administrator of
            the company; and

      (g)   all claims by third parties in respect of letters of credit issued
            under this agreement including without limitation, all letter of
            credit liabilities.

ITEMS INCLUDED IN LOSS, LIABILITY AND COSTS

16.3  The company agrees that:

      (a)   the costs referred to in clause 16.1 ("Reimbursement and indemnity")
            and the liability, loss or costs in clause 16.2 ("Other loss")
            include legal costs in accordance with any written agreement as to
            legal costs or, if no agreement, on whichever is the higher of a
            full indemnity basis or solicitor and own client basis; and

      (b)   the costs referred to in clauses 16.1(a) and (b) ("Reimbursement and
            indemnity") include those paid or payable, to persons engaged by GE
            Capital in connection with the transaction documents (such as
            consultants).

PAYMENT OF EMPLOYEES' LOSSES

16.4  The company agrees to pay GE Capital an amount equal to any liability,
      loss or costs of the kind referred to in clause 16.2 ("Other loss")
      suffered or incurred by any employee, officer, agent or contractor of GE
      Capital.

CURRENCY CONVERSION ON JUDGMENT DEBT

16.5  If a judgment or proof of debt for an amount in connection with a
      transaction document is expressed in a currency other than Australian
      dollars, then the company indemnifies GE Capital against:

      (a)   any difference arising from converting the other currency if the
            rate of exchange used by GE Capital under clause 5.5 ("Conversion of
            currency") for converting currency when it receives a payment in the
            other currency is less favourable to GE


                              Page 37 of 84 Pages
<PAGE>

            Capital than the rate of exchange used for the purpose of the
            judgment or acceptance of proof of debt; and

      (b)   the costs of conversion.

CERTIFICATE BY GE CAPITAL

16.6  A statement or certificate given by GE Capital setting out the amount of
      any loss, liability or costs incurred or suffered by GE Capital (including
      the extent of GE Capital's entitlement to a full or reduced input tax
      credit for GST paid in respect of any matter contemplated in a transaction
      document) is, absent manifest error, prima facie evidence against the
      obligor of the amount of that loss, liability or cost.

17.   INTEREST ON OVERDUE AMOUNTS

OBLIGATION TO PAY

17.1  If the obligor fails to pay any amount under this agreement on the due
      date for payment, the obligor agrees to pay to GE Capital on demand
      interest on that amount at the default rate. The interest accrues from day
      to day from and including the due date up to but excluding the date of
      actual payment and is calculated on actual days elapsed and a year of 360
      days.

COMPOUNDING

17.2  Interest payable under clause 17.1 ("Obligation to pay") which is not paid
      when due for payment may be added to the overdue amount by GE Capital at
      intervals which GE Capital determines from time to time or, if no
      determination is made, every 30 days. Interest is payable on the increased
      overdue amount at the default rate in the manner set out in clause 17.1
      ("Obligation to pay").

INTEREST FOLLOWING JUDGMENT

17.3  If a liability becomes merged in a judgment, then the company agrees to
      pay GE Capital on demand interest on the amount of that liability as an
      independent obligation. This interest:

      (a)   accrues from the date the liability becomes due for payment both
            before and after the judgment until the liability is paid; and

      (b)   is calculated at the rate that is the higher of the judgment rate
            and the default rate.

18.   GUARANTEE AND INDEMNITY

REQUEST AND CONSIDERATION

18.1  By signing this agreement, the guarantor requests GE Capital to enter into
      this agreement and agrees to be bound by this guarantee, the provisions

19.   ATTORNEY

APPOINTMENT OF ATTORNEY

19.1  The obligor irrevocably appoints GE Capital and each of its authorised

      taken by an attorney under clause 19.2 ("Attorneys' powers").

ATTORNEYS' POWERS

19.2  Each attorney may where an Event of Default has occurred and subsists:

      (a)   perform and observe the obligations of the obligor under this

            agreement; and

      (b)   do anything which an obligor may lawfully do to exercise their right
            of proof after an event relating to insolvency occurs in respect of
            obligor (these things may be done in the obligor's name or the
            attorney's name and they include signing and delivering documents,
            taking part in legal proceedings and receiving any dividend arising
            out of the right of proof); and

      (c)   delegate its powers (including this power) and may revoke a
            delegation; and

      (d)   exercise its powers even if this involves a conflict of duty and
            even if it has a personal interest in doing so.

APPLICATION OF INSOLVENCY DIVIDENDS

19.3  The attorney need not account to an obligor for any dividend received on
      exercising the right of proof under clause 19.2 ("Attorneys' powers")
      except to the extent that any dividend remains after GE Capital has
      received all amounts payable or to become payable in the future under this
      agreement.

RIGHT OF PROOF LIMITED

19.4  Each obligor agrees not to exercise a right of proof after an event occurs
      relating to the insolvency of the company or any other obligor
      independently of an attorney appointed under clause 19.1 ("Appointment of
      attorney").

20.   DEALING WITH INTERESTS

NO DEALING BY COMPANY

DEALINGS BY GE CAPITAL

      dealing with its rights under the transaction documents.

NO SET-OFF AGAINST ASSIGNEES

20.3  If GE Capital assigns or otherwise deals with its rights under this
      agreement, the obligor may claim against any assignee (or any other person

      arise under this agreement or the transaction documents.

SET-OFF

22.1  At any time after an event of default has occurred and subsists, GE
      Capital may set off any amount due for payment by GE Capital to the
      obligor against any amount due for payment by the obligor to GE Capital
      under the transaction documents. Where an event of default has occurred
      and subsists, the obligor may claim or set-off any money owing by GE
      Capital to it against money owing by the obligor to GE Capital.

SUSPENSE ACCOUNT

22.2  GE Capital may place in a suspense account any payment it receives from
      the obligor for as long as it thinks prudent and need not apply it towards
      satisfying any money owing to GE Capital under this agreement.

CERTIFICATES

22.3  GE Capital may give the obligor a certificate about an amount payable or
      interest rate in connection with a transaction document. A certificate
      containing reasonable detail of the calculation of the amount or
      determination of the interest rate is (absent obvious error) prima facie
      evidence of the amount.

PROMPT PERFORMANCE

22.4  If this agreement specifies when the obligor must perform an obligation,
      the obligor agrees to perform it by the time specified. The obligor agrees
      to perform all other obligations promptly.

      any way it considers appropriate, including by imposing conditions unless
      a transaction document states otherwise.

CONSENTS

22.6  The obligor agrees to comply with all conditions in any consent GE Capital
      gives in connection with any transaction document.

PARTIAL EXERCISING OF RIGHTS

22.7  If GE Capital does not exercise a right or remedy fully or at a given
      time, GE Capital can still exercise it later.

<PAGE>

NO LIABILITY FOR LOSS

22.8  GE Capital is not liable for loss caused by the exercise or attempted
      exercise of, failure to exercise, or delay in exercising, a right or
      remedy other than caused by GE's negligence or default.

CONFLICT OF INTEREST

22.9  GE Capital's rights and remedies under any transaction document may be
      exercised even if this involves a conflict of duty or GE Capital has a
      personal interest in their exercise.

REMEDIES CUMULATIVE

22.10 The rights and remedies of GE Capital under any transaction document are
      in addition to other rights and remedies given by law independently of
      that transaction document.

RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS ARE UNAFFECTED

22.11 Rights given to GE Capital under this agreement and the obligor's
      liabilities under it are not affected by any law that might otherwise
      affect them.

INDEMNITIES

22.12 The indemnities in this agreement are continuing obligations, independent
      of the obligor's other obligations under this agreement and continue after
      this agreement ends. It is not necessary for GE Capital to incur expense
      or make payment before enforcing a right of indemnity conferred by this
      agreement.

VARIATION AND WAIVER

22.13 Unless this agreement expressly states otherwise, a provision of this
      agreement, or right created under it, may not be waived or varied except
      in writing signed by the party or parties to be bound.

CONFIDENTIALITY

22.14 The obligors consent to GE Capital disclosing information provided by the
      obligors that is not publicly available:

      (a)   in connection with any person exercising rights or dealing with
            rights or obligations under a transaction document (including in
            connection with preparatory steps such as negotiating with any
            potential assignee or potential participant of GE Capital's rights
            or other person who is considering contracting with GE Capital in
            connection with a transaction document); or

      (b)   to a person considering entering into (or who does enter into) a
            credit swap with GE Capital involving credit events relating to the
            obligor or any of its related entities; or

<PAGE>

      (d)   to any party to a transaction document or any related entity of GE
            Capital; or

      (e)   with the consent of the obligor about whom the information relates
            (which consent must not be unreasonably withheld); or

      (f)   as allowed necessary or required by any law court, regulatory body,
            tribunal, authority, judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings or by
            any stock exchange.

FURTHER STEPS

22.15 The obligor agrees to do anything GE Capital asks (such as obtaining
      consents, signing and producing documents and getting documents completed
      and signed) to bind the obligor and any other person intended to be bound
      under the transaction documents.

INCONSISTENT LAW

22.16 To the extent permitted by law, each transaction document prevails to the
      extent it is inconsistent with any law.

SUPERVENING LEGISLATION

22.17 Any present or future legislation which operates to vary the obligations
      of an obligor in connection with a transaction document with the result
      that GE Capital's rights, powers or remedies are adversely affected
      (including by way of delay or postponement) is excluded except to the
      extent that its exclusion is prohibited or rendered ineffective by law.

TIME OF THE ESSENCE

22.18 Time is of the essence in any transaction document in respect of an
      obligation of the obligor to pay money.

APPLICABLE LAW

22.19 The transaction documents are governed by the law in force in New South
      Wales. The obligor and GE Capital submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction
      of the courts of New South Wales.

SERVING DOCUMENTS

22.20 Without preventing any other method of service, any document in a court
      action may be served on a party by being delivered to or left at that
      party's address for service of notices under clause 21 ("Notices").

ADVERTISING

22.21 The obligor consents to the publication by GE Capital of a "tombstone" or
      similar advertising material relating to the transactions contemplated in
      the transaction documents.

      signed by one or more parties to the agreement. When taken together, the
      signed copies are treated as making up the one document. Any copy of this
      agreement signed by a party is binding on that party whether or not that
      or any other copy is signed by or binding upon any other party.

SEVERANCE

22.23 Each word, phrase, sentence, paragraph and clause in each transaction
      document is severable no matter how they are linked. If any word, phrase,

            invoice is subject to the company's completion of further
            performance under that contract;

      (f)   that is not a true and correct statement of bona fide indebtedness
            incurred in the amount of the account for goods sold to or services
            rendered and accepted by the applicable account debtor;

      (g)   with respect to which an invoice, acceptable to GE Capital in form

      (j)   that arises from a sale to any officer, other employee, related
            entity or affiliate of the obligor, or to any entity which has any
            common officer with the obligor;

      (k)   that is not paid within 90 days of the end of the month in which the
            invoice was issued;

      (l)   if the relevant account debtor is or becomes insolvent:

      (m)   if GE Capital's interest in it is not a first priority security

            accounts set forth in any transaction document is untrue;

      (o)   which is payable in any currency other than Australian Dollars;

      (p)   that is the obligation of a debtor outside Australia, unless the

            GE Capital;

            the company, to the extent of the company's liability to the debtor;

      (r)   that arises with respect to goods which are delivered on a

            other terms by reason of which the payment by the debtor may be
            conditional;

SCHEDULE 5 - LETTERS OF CREDIT (CLAUSE 2.11)

REQUESTING A LETTER OF CREDIT

      s5.1  If the company wants a letter of credit to be issued, the company
            must have excess availability in excess of the face value amount of
            the letter of credit requested. The company agrees to give a letter
            of credit application to GE Capital no later than 2 business days
            before the proposed issuance date. The letter of credit application
            must contain:

            (a)   details of the beneficiary of the requested letter of credit;
                  and

            (b)   the proposed issuance date of the requested letter of credit
                  (which must be no later than 2 business days after the date of
                  the letter of credit application); and

            (c)   the proposed expiry date (if any) of the requested letter of
                  credit which must be no later than one year after the issuance
                  date without GE Capital's written consent, and must not be any
                  later than the maturity date; and

            (d)   the face value amount in Australian dollars of the requested
                  letter of credit (which must be an amount which when added to
                  the face value amount of each current LC must not exceed the
                  letter of credit facility limit and must not exceed the amount
                  of any excess availability calculated at that time); and

            (e)   any other information GE Capital may reasonably require from
                  time to time.

LETTER OF CREDIT FACILITY LIMIT

      s5.2  The total amount of the letter of credit liability which is payable
            or to become payable in respect of all letters of credit issued
            under this agreement must not exceed the letter of credit facility
            limit.

EFFECT OF A LETTER OF CREDIT APPLICATION

      s5.3  A letter of credit application is effective when GE Capital actually
            receives it in legible form. An effective letter of credit
            application is irrevocable unless the company advises GE Capital in
            writing that the company no longer requires a letter of credit and
            at that time GE Capital has not taken any steps to make the letter
            of credit available which GE Capital cannot rescind or reverse
            without GE Capital incurring a loss.

CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO ISSUE OF AN LC

      s5.4  The company must ensure that the form of the letter of credit is
            satisfactory to GE Capital and the issuing bank.


                              Page 68 of 84 Pages
<PAGE>

PAYMENT OF AN LC

      s5.5  If a letter of credit is called or if any letter of credit liability
            arises or is paid by GE Capital, then the amount called, payable or
            paid must be immediately repaid to GE Capital. GE Capital may debit
            the company's loan account with the amount required to be paid. The
            debit is deemed to be a current drawing under the facility of the
            amount called payable or paid. The company acknowledges its
            indebtedness to GE Capital for the amount of that current drawing.

      s5.6  If any letter of credit is issued in a currency other than
            Australian dollars, GE Capital may convert the amount of the letter
            of credit liability into Australian dollars (even though it may be
            necessary to convert through a third currency to do so) for the
            purpose of calculating the amount of the letter of credit liability
            on the day and at the rates it considers appropriate and may add its
            usual costs in connection to the conversion to Australian dollars.

      s5.7  Without prejudice to any other power of GE Capital, upon or at any
            time after the occurrence of an event of default and for so long as
            it subsists, GE Capital may require the company by notice to pay to
            GE Capital cash cover equal to 100% of the face value amount of each
            current LC (where the letter of credit is denominated in Australian
            dollars) and otherwise an amount equal to 105% of the face value
            amount of each current LC. Upon receiving the notice the company
            must immediately pay the cash cover specified in the notice to GE
            Capital in immediately available funds and in Australian dollars.
            The additional 5% of the face value amount of each current LC
            ("Buffer") is to be applied by GE Capital against any costs relating
            to foreign exchange conversion. To the extent that such costs are
            less than the amount representing the Buffer, GE Capital shall repay
            the balance of the cash cover to the company.

      s5.8  If any LC obligations are subsisting on the maturity date, the
            company must either immediately:

            (a)   cause each current LC to be returned to the issuer and
                  cancelled; or

            (b)   pay to GE Capital, in immediately available funds, an amount
                  equal to 100% of the face value amount of each current LC
                  (where the letter of credit is denominated in Australian
                  dollars) and otherwise an amount equal to 105% of the
                  aggregate amount of the face value amount of each current LC
                  to be held by GE Capital as cash collateral in an account of
                  GE Capital; or

            (c)   procure the delivery to GE Capital of a bank guarantee in form
                  and substance and in currencies approved by GE Capital in an
                  amount equal to 100% of the face value amount of each current
                  LC (where the letter of credit is denominated in Australian
                  dollars) and otherwise an amount equal to 105% of the
                  aggregate amount of the face value amount of current LCs.


                              Page 69 of 84 Pages
<PAGE>

      s5.9  Without prejudice to any other power of GE Capital, if any LC
            obligations are subsisting on the maturity date or on the occurrence
            of any event of default, GE Capital may pay the beneficiary all
            amounts payable or to become payable in the future under the letter
            of credit.

SCHEDULE 7 - GUARANTEE AND INDEMNITY (CLAUSE 18.1)

GUARANTEE

      s7.1  The guarantor unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees payment to
            GE Capital of the guaranteed money and guarantees to GE Capital the
            due performance by the company of the company's obligations to GE
            Capital under the transaction documents as a principal obligation.
            If the company does not pay the guaranteed money on time and in
            accordance with the transaction documents, then the guarantor agrees
            to pay the guaranteed money to GE Capital on demand. A demand may be
            made at any time and from time to time and whether or not GE Capital
            has made demand on the company.

NATURE OF GUARANTEE

      s7.2  This guarantee is a continuing obligation and extends to all of the
            guaranteed money.

INDEMNITY

      s7.3  The guarantor unconditionally and irrevocably indemnifies GE Capital
            as a principal obligation against any liability or loss (including
            consequential or economic loss) arising, and any costs GE Capital
            suffers or incurs:

            (a)   if an obligor does not, is not obliged to, or is unable to,
                  pay the guaranteed money in accordance with the transaction
                  documents; or

            (b)   if the guarantor is not obliged to pay GE Capital an amount
                  under clause s7.1 ("Guarantee"); or

            (c)   if GE Capital is obliged, or agrees, to pay an amount to a
                  trustee in bankruptcy or liquidator (of an insolvent person)
                  in connection with a payment by an obligor (for example, GE
                  Capital may have to, or may agree to, pay interest on the
                  amount); or

            (d)   if the guarantor defaults under this guarantee; or

            (e)   in connection with any person exercising, or not exercising,
                  rights under this guarantee; or

            (f)   if any obligor defaults under this agreement or any
                  transaction document; or

            (g)   if the guaranteed money is not recoverable or recovered by GE
                  Capital from any obligor.

REINSTATEMENT OF RIGHTS

      s7.4  A trustee in bankruptcy, liquidator or controller or any other
            person may ask GE Capital to refund a payment it has received or
            otherwise repay money it has received in connection with this
            guarantee the guaranteed money or the


                              Page 72 of 84 Pages
<PAGE>

            transactions documents. To the extent GE Capital is obliged to, or
            agrees to, make a refund or repayment it may treat the payment as if
            it had not been made. It is then entitled to its rights against the
            guarantor under this guarantee as if the payment had never been
            made. This applies despite anything in this guarantee.

RIGHTS OF GE CAPITAL ARE PROTECTED

      s7.5  Rights given to GE Capital under this guarantee (and the guarantor's
            liabilities under it) are not affected by any act or omission by GE
            Capital or by anything else that might otherwise affect them under
            law or otherwise, including:

            (a)   the fact that it varies or replaces any arrangement under
                  which the guaranteed money is expressed to be owing, such as
                  by increasing the facility limit or extending the term; or

            (b)   the fact that it releases the company or an obligor or gives
                  it a concession, such as more time to pay or compromises any
                  of the guaranteed money; or

            (c)   the fact that the company opens an account with it; or

            (d)   the fact it releases, loses the benefit of or does not obtain
                  any transaction document; or

            (e)   the fact that it does not register any transaction document
                  which could be registered; or

            (f)   the fact that it releases any person who guarantees any of the
                  company's obligations; or

            (g)   the fact that a person becomes a guarantor after the date of
                  this agreement; or

            (h)   the fact that the obligations of any person who guarantees any
                  of the company's obligations may be void or may not be
                  enforceable; or

            (i)   the fact that any person who was intended to guarantee any of
                  the company's obligations does not do so or does not do so
                  effectively; or

            (j)   the death, mental or physical disability or insolvency of any
                  person including an obligor; or

            (k)   changes in the membership, name or business of any person; or

            (l)   any neglect, omission, default or delay of GE Capital.

NO MERGER

      s7.6  This guarantee does not merge with or adversely affect, and is not
            adversely affected by, any of the following:

            (a)   any other guarantee, indemnity, or security interest, or other
                  right or remedy to which GE Capital is entitled; or


                              Page 73 of 84 Pages
<PAGE>

            (b)   a judgment which GE Capital obtains against the guarantor in
                  connection with the guaranteed money or any other amount
                  payable under this guarantee.

            GE Capital may still exercise rights under this guarantee as well as
            under the judgment, other guarantee, indemnity, security interest,
            or other right or remedy.

EXTENT OF GUARANTOR'S OBLIGATIONS

      s7.7  If more than one person is named as "guarantor" each of them is
            liable for all the obligations under this guarantee both separately
            on its own and jointly with any one or more other persons named as
            "guarantor". This guarantee binds each person who signs as
            "guarantor" even if another person who was intended to sign does not
            sign it or is not bound by it.

GUARANTOR'S RIGHTS ARE SUSPENDED

      s.7.8 As long as any of the guaranteed money remains unpaid, the guarantor
            may not, without GE Capital's written consent:

            (a)   reduce its liability under this guarantee by claiming that it
                  or any obligor or any other person has a right of set-off
                  subrogation or counterclaim against GE Capital; or

            (b)   exercise any legal right to claim to be entitled to the
                  benefit of another guarantee, indemnity, or security interest
                  given in connection with the guaranteed money or any other
                  amount payable under this guarantee (for example, the
                  guarantor may not try to enforce any security interest GE
                  Capital has taken to ensure repayment of the guaranteed
                  money); or

            (c)   claim an amount from the company, or another guarantor of the
                  company's obligations, under a right of indemnity or any other
                  claim, or enforce any right against either of them; or

                              TERMS AND CONDITIONS

of Credit. GE Capital Finance Pty Limited ("GE CAPITAL") may, upon the
Applicant's application therefor, and to the extent such application is approved
in accordance with the Facility Agreement by GE Capital, arrange for the
issuance of credits through GE Capital Trade Services Ltd (the "BANK"), a Hong
Kong corporation and wholly owned by General Electric Capital Corporation or
through another financial institution satisfactory to GE Capital. Each
Documentary Letter of Credit issued through the Bank (hereinafter each such
Documentary Letter of Credit will be referred to as the "Credit") will be
governed by and interpreted in accordance with the following terms and
conditions. Capitalized terms shall have the meanings accorded them in Section
9, Definitions, below.

1.    PAYMENT TERMS.

      Applicant agrees to pay to GE Capital on demand in the manner provided for
      by the Facility Agreement in the currency stipulated in the Facility
      Agreement, in immediately available funds: (i) each amount drawn under the
      Credit in Dollars or in the event that drafts under the Credit are payable
      in a currency other than Dollars, the Dollar Equivalent of each amount so
      drawn; (ii) interest on each amount (or the Dollar Equivalent thereof) so
      drawn for each day from the date of payment of the relevant draft up to
      and including the date of payment in full of such amount by Applicant to
      GE Capital, at a rate per annum equal to the rate per annum on Annex A
      hereto, or, if none is specified, in accordance with the Facility
      Agreement; and (iii) any and all commissions and charges of, and any and
      all costs and expenses incurred by, GE Capital, the Bank and each of their
      correspondents in relation to the Credit and all drafts thereunder.

2.    SECURITY INTEREST.

      Under the Transaction Documents the Applicant has granted to GE Capital
      security over all of its assets and undertakings. The rights under the
      Transaction Documents do not limit any other rights GE Capital or the Bank
      may have at law, including the interest in and unqualified right to the
      possession and disposal of all property shipped under or in connection
      with the Credit, and also in and to all shipping documents, documents of
      title or drafts drawn under the Credit.

3.    ADMINISTRATION OF CREDIT.

      (a)   Applicant will promptly examine the copy of the Credit (and any
            amendments thereof) sent to Applicant, as well as all other
            instruments and documents delivered to Applicant from time to time
            in connection with the Credit, and, in the event Applicant has any
            claim of non-compliance with the instructions or of any discrepancy
            or other irregularity, Applicant will immediately notify GE Capital
            thereof in writing, and Applicant will conclusively be deemed to
            have waived any such claim against GE Capital, Bank and their
            correspondents unless such immediate notice is given as aforesaid.

      (b)   Neither Bank, GE Capital nor any of their correspondents shall be
            responsible for, and neither Bank's and GE Capital's powers and
            rights hereunder nor Applicant's Obligations shall be affected by:
            (i) any act or omission pursuant to Applicant's instructions; (ii)
            any other act or omission of Bank, GE Capital or their
            correspondents or their respective agents or employees other than
            any such arising from its or their gross negligence or wilful
            misconduct; (iii) the validity, accuracy or genuineness of drafts,
            documents or required statements, even if such drafts, documents or
            statements should in fact prove to be in any or all respects
            invalid, inaccurate, fraudulent or forged (and notwithstanding that
            Applicant shall have notified Bank or GE Capital thereof); (iv)
            failure of any draft to bear any reference or adequate reference to
            the Credit; (v) errors, omissions, interruptions or delays in
            transmission of delivery of any messages however sent and whether or
            not in code or otherwise; (vi) any act, default, omission,
            insolvency or failure in business of any other person (including any
            correspondent) or any consequences arising from causes beyond Bank's
            or GE Capital's control; or (vii) any acts or omissions of any
            Beneficiary of the Credit or transferee of the Credit, if
            transferable. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
            Bank may (i) act in reliance on any oral, telephone, telegraphic,
            electronic, facsimile or written request, notice, or instruction
            believed in good faith to be from or have been authorised by the
            Applicant, (ii) receive, accept or pay as complying with the terms
            of the Credit any Drafts or other documents, otherwise in order,
            which are signed by or issued to any person or entity acting as the
            representative of, or in the place of, the party in whose name the
            Credit provides that any Drafts or other documents should be drawn
            or issued and (iii) waive its stipulation that the bank nominated in
            the Credit shall accept or pay the Drafts, and the Bank may then
            accept presentations of Drafts and documents for payment directly.

      (c)   GE Capital may appoint any of its other related bodies corporate as
            "Bank" at any time and any Bank may assign or otherwise deal with
            all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement or the Credit,
            (including without limitation any reimbursement obligation owing to
            it) in any way it sees fit including to any subsidiary or related
            bodies corporate of General Electric Capital Corporation, in each
            case without prior notice to Applicant.

4.    EXTENSIONS, INCREASES AND MODIFICATIONS OF CREDIT.

      Each Applicant agrees that GE Capital, acting through the Bank may at any
      time and from time to time, in its discretion, by agreement with one or
      more other Applicants: (a) further finance or refinance any transaction
      under the Credit; (b) renew, extend or change the time of payment or the
      manner, place or terms of payment of any of the Obligations; (c) settle or
      compromise any of the Obligations or subordinate the payment thereof to
      the payment of any other debts of or claims against any Applicant which
      may at the time be due or owing to the Bank; or (d) release any Applicant
      or any Guarantor or any Collateral, or modify the terms under which such
      Collateral is held, or forego any right of set-off, or modify or amend in
      any way this Agreement or the Credit, or give any waiver of consent under
      this Agreement.

5.    RESERVE REQUIREMENTS AND SIMILAR COSTS.

      If Bank is now or hereafter becomes subject to any reserve, special
      deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with, or for
      the account of, or credit extended by, Bank, or any other condition is
      imposed upon Bank which imposes a cost upon Bank, and the result, in the
      determination of Bank is to increase the cost to Bank of maintaining a
      Credit or paying or funding the payment of any draft thereunder, or to
      reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable, directly, by Bank
      hereunder, Applicant will pay to Bank upon demand such amounts required to
      compensate Bank for such increased cost or reduction. In making the
      determinations contemplated hereunder, Bank may make such estimates,
      assumptions, allocations and the like which Bank in good faith determines
      to be appropriate, but Bank's selection thereof, and Bank's determinations
      based thereon, shall be prima facie evidence upon Applicant absent
      manifest error.

6.    POSSESSION OF PROPERTY BY APPLICANT.

      If the Applicant obtains possession of goods or other property, if any,
      covered by the Credit, prior to the Bank's receipt and review of
      documents, then all discrepancies and other irregularities of said
      documents shall be deemed waived by the Applicant, and the Bank is
      authorised and directed to pay any Drafts drawn or purporting to be drawn
      upon the Credit.

7.    PARTIAL SHIPMENTS.

      (a)   Except as otherwise expressly stated in the Credit (i) partial
            shipments may be made under the Credit, and the Bank may honour the
            relative Drafts without inquiry regardless of any apparent
            disproportion between the quantity shipped and the amount of the
            relative Draft and the total amount of the Credit and the total
            quantity to be shipped under the Credit, and (ii) if the Credit
            specifies shipments in instalments within stated periods and the
            shipper fails to ship in any designated period, shipments of
            subsequent instalments may nevertheless be made in their respective
            designated periods and the Bank may honour the relative Drafts.

8.    EVENTS OF DEFAULT, REMEDIES; PRE-FUNDING.

      (a)   If any Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, GE
            Capital may declare all or any part of the Obligations (including
            any such which may be contingent and not matured) to be immediately
            due and payable. GE Capital may exercise any other rights it may
            have under the Transaction Documents if an Event of Default occurs
            and is subsisting.

      (b)   Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Applicant agrees
            that if: (a) any Event of Default or event which with notice or
            lapse of time would become an Event of Default shall have occurred;
            (b) GE Capital at any time and for any reason reasonably deems
            itself or Bank to be insecure or the risk of non-payment or
            non-performance of any of the Obligations to have increased; or (c)
            in the event that the Credit is denominated in a currency other than
            Dollars, GE Capital determines that such currency is unavailable or
            that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are unlawful or
            contrary to any regulations to which GE Capital or Bank may be
            subject or that due to currency fluctuations the Dollar Equivalent
            of the amount of a Credit exceeds the amount of Dollars that Bank in
            its sole judgment expected to be its maximum exposure under a
            Credit, then Applicant will upon demand pay to GE Capital an amount
            equal to the undisbursed portion, if any, of


                              Page 78 of 84 Pages
<PAGE>

            the Credits, and such amount shall be held as additional Collateral
            for the payment of all Obligations, and after the expiration hereof,

GENERAL TERMS

INTERPRETATION

Definitions of terms are at the end of these General Terms.

WHAT THE CHARGOR UNDERTAKES IN THIS CHARGE

1.1   By signing this document the Chargor undertakes certain obligations. The
      Chargor also gives GE Capital rights concerning the Chargor and the
      Secured Property - for example, if the Chargor does not comply with its
      obligations, GE Capital may take possession of the Secured Property, sell
      or otherwise deal with it, and sue the Chargor for any remaining money the
      Chargor owes to GE Capital.

1.2   The Chargor is liable for all of the obligations under this document and
      under the Transaction Documents both individually and collectively with
      any one or more other persons named in this document as Chargor.

1.3   The Chargor must ensure that it is not in default under this document and
      under the Transaction Documents. The Chargor also agrees to carry out on
      time all its obligations under the Transaction Documents to GE Capital.

1.4   The Chargor's obligations under this security (other than in connection
      with the Secured Property) continue even if GE Capital releases the
      Secured Property from this security.

1.5   This document operates as though it were two separate documents between GE
      Capital and each Chargor. All representations and undertakings in this
      document are given by a chargor in respect of its Secured Property, the
      Amount Owing by it and the Transaction Documents to which it is a party.

CHARGE

2.1   Subject to clause 2.3, for the purpose of securing to GE Capital payment
      of the Amount Owing, the Chargor charges all of its present and future
      rights, title and interest in, to, under or derived from the Secured
      Property to GE Capital. The Chargor does this as beneficial owner.

2.2   This charge is a first ranking security.

2.3   The Chargor may require GE Capital to release the Secured Property from
      this document if there is no Amount Owing. However, even if the Amount
      Owing is repaid, the Secured Property remains charged to GE Capital until
      GE Capital actually releases it from this document.

2.4   The security given under this document by one Chargor secures the same
      money as the security given under this document by each other Chargor.
      There may also be Collateral Securities that secure the same money.

                                       3


FIXED OR FLOATING?

3.1   The charge is fixed over all present and future:

      (a)   capital and Share premiums of the Chargor; and

      (b)   goodwill of the Chargor; and

      (c)   estates and interests in land of the Chargor, including each
            fixture, structure or improvement on land or fixed to it and all
            proceeds of sale of any of them; and

      (d)   plant and machinery of the Chargor; and

      (e)   all rights under documents or agreements of any kind not referred to
            in Clause 3.1(h) to which the Chargor is a party; and

      (f)   book debts which are Eligible Accounts of the Chargor and money
            owing to the Chargor in a Controlled Account in the Chargor's name;
            and

      (g)   cash, cheques, money orders and other receipts of the Chargor; and

      (h)   securities (other than Shares and New Rights which are charged
            pursuant to clause 3.1(k)), documents of title and any other
            documents (whether or not negotiable), that the Chargor deposits
            with GE Capital at any time and for any reason; and

      (i)   books of account, invoices, statements, ledger cards, computer
            software and records and other media relating to the Chargor's
            business transactions; and

      (j)   interests in personal property that are not acquired by the Chargor
            for disposal by the Chargor in its ordinary course of business; and

      (k)   Shares and New Rights owned by the Chargor; and

      (l)   licenses held by the Chargor in relation to its business; and

      (m)   Intellectual Property of the Chargor; and

      (n)   Encumbrances held by the Chargor over any property; and

      (o)   rights to make any claims including under any statute, ordinance,
            law, contracts, security, Encumbrance or insurance policy; and

      (p)   any other property if clause 3.3 says the charge is to be fixed over
            that property.

3.2   The charge is floating over all the other Secured Property.

3.3   Where the charge is floating (whether under the terms of the charge or at
      law), it immediately and automatically becomes fixed:

<PAGE>
                                       4


      (a)   over any Secured Property GE Capital notifies the Chargor is to be
            subject to a fixed charge (GE Capital can only give the Chargor this
            notice if an Event of Default has occurred and is subsisting; and

      (b)   over any Secured Property affected if:

            (i)   the Chargor breaches an obligation under clause 6; or

            (ii)  a judgment, order or Encumbrance is:

                  (A)   enforced;

                  (B)   becomes enforceable; or

                  (C)   can be rendered enforceable by the giving of notice,
                        lapse of time or fulfilment of a condition,

            in respect of that Secured Property; and

      (c)   over all the Secured Property if the Chargor is or becomes Insolvent
            or steps are taken to make it Insolvent; and

      (d)   over the Secured Property that is money or rights to money if the
            Chargor does not pay Taxes on time; and

      (e)   if the law provides that the charge becomes fixed.

3.4   GE Capital can give the Chargor a notice stating that from a date
      specified in the notice the property specified in the notice is subject to
      a floating charge (and not a fixed charge). The Chargor charges to GE
      Capital by way of floating charge the property specified in the notice as
      security for payment of the Amount Owing on the same terms as the charge
      given under clause 2.1. The charge can then again become fixed in the
      circumstances contemplated by clause 3.3.

3.5   In relation to any book debt or any amount owing to the Chargor in a
      Controlled Account in the Chargor's name, present or future while the
      whole or part of it remains unpaid, the Chargor must not deal with or
      dispose of it in any way including by transfer, assignment, factoring,
      barter or other Encumbrance and must not allow any discount, set off,
      release, write-off or credit to be issued without GE Capital's consent,
      other than as permitted by clause 3.6.

3.6   GE Capital appoints the Chargor as GE Capital's agent in respect of all
      present and future book debts which are Eligible Accounts ("Book Debts")
      on the following terms:

      (a)   the Chargor must collect and receive all money payable in respect of
            Book Debts; and

      (b)   the Chargor must pay all proceeds of the Book Debts into a
            Controlled Account in the Chargor's name or any other account
            nominated or approved by GE Capital for that purpose from time to
            time; and

<PAGE>
                                       5


      (c)   the Chargor must direct the relevant debtors to send payments of
            money owing to the Chargor in respect of the Book Debts to the
            credit of a Controlled Account in the Chargor's name or any other
            account nominated or approved by GE Capital for that purpose from
            time to time, and, if expressly required by GE Capital, endorse on
            all the Chargor's invoices, statements and other requests for
            payment a direction to send payment to the address of the Blocked
            Account Bank; and

      (d)   the proceeds of Book Debts deposited to the account referred to in
            clause (b) may only be dealt with in accordance with the Blocked
            Account Agreement for the relevant Controlled Account; and

      (e)   the Chargor may allow any write-off or discount to occur or credit
            note to be issued in relation to any Book Debt where to do so would
            represent a deduction from the Book Debt that would be reasonable in
            the ordinary commercial practice of the Chargor; and

      (f)   this agency may be terminated by GE Capital at any time by notice in
            writing to the Chargor and will terminate automatically if any event
            referred to in clause 3.3 occurs where the Secured Property affected
            (as referred to in that clause) includes the Book Debts.

3.7   The Chargor may deal with the Secured Property referred to in clause
      3.1(g) in the manner permitted by the Transaction Documents.

HOW THIS SECURITY AFFECTS THE CHARGOR AND THE SECURED PROPERTY

LOOKING AFTER THE SECURED PROPERTY

4.1   The Chargor agrees:

      (a)   to keep the Secured Property in good working order and condition
            (subject to fair wear and tear) and correct any defect; and

      (b)   to protect the Secured Property from theft, loss or damage; and

      (c)   to preserve the Secured Property and not to do anything that might
            lower the value of the Secured Property;

      (d)   to protect and enforce its title and GE Capital's interest as
            chargee in and to the Secured Property; and

      (e)   to tell GE Capital if the Secured Property is

            (i)   contaminated in breach of Environmental Laws and such breach
                  is likely to have a Material Adverse Effect; or

            (ii)  defective or seriously damaged.

4.2   The Chargor agrees to:

<PAGE>
                                       6


      (a)   give GE Capital any order or material notice from a government
            authority concerning the use or condition of the Secured Property as
            soon as the Chargor becomes aware of it; and

      (b)   comply with all laws and requirements of authorities and its other
            obligations in connection with the Secured Property where
            non-compliance might reasonably be expected to have a Material
            Adverse Effect; and

      (c)   ensure that each person who uses or occupies the Secured Property
            complies with all laws and requirements of authorities in connection
            with the Secured Property where non-compliance might reasonably be
            expected to have a Material Adverse Effect; and

      (d)   get GE Capital's consent (not to be unreasonably withheld) before
            the Chargor conducts major Works relating to land or any fixture,
            structure or improvement on land or fixed to it forming part of the
            Secured Property or enters into a contract to carry them out; and

      (e)   give GE Capital details about all land and interests in land (such
            as leases) it acquires; and

      (f)   immediately notify GE Capital if it becomes bound to complete the
            acquisition of any real property (freehold or leasehold) and if it
            receives any deed or document of title relating to the real
            property.

INSURANCE CLAIMS

5.1   The Chargor agrees to do its best to ensure that proceeds from an
      insurance claim are:

      (a)   used to reinstate the Secured Property; or

      (b)   paid to GE Capital (GE Capital agrees to then use them as set out in
            clause 17).

      However, where an Event of Default has occurred and subsists GE Capital
      may direct the Chargor to use or hold any insurance proceeds in a
      particular way, and the Chargor agrees to use or hold them as GE Capital
      directs.

5.2   The Chargor agrees to notify GE Capital if an insurance claim is refused
      either in part or in full.

5.3   If GE Capital notifies the Chargor where an Event of Default has occurred
      and subsists, GE Capital may take over the Chargor's rights to make,
      pursue or settle an insurance claim. GE Capital may exercise those rights
      in any manner it chooses.

DEALING WITH THE SECURED PROPERTY

6.1   The Chargor must not, except as permitted by the Transaction Documents or
      with the prior consent of GE Capital:

      (a)   create or allow to arise another Encumbrance in connection with the
            Secured Property or allow one to arise other than a Permitted
            Security Interest; or

<PAGE>
                                       7


      (b)   create a trust, Power or lien in connection with the Secured
            Property or allow one to arise; or

      (c)   deal in any way with its rights under this security, or allow any
            interest in them to arise or be varied.

6.2   Except as expressly permitted under the Transaction Documents, the Chargor
      agrees to get GE Capital's consent before it does, or agrees to do, any of
      the following in respect of the Secured Property over which the charge is
      fixed:

      (a)   sell the Secured Property; or

      (b)   lease or license the Secured Property, or allow a surrender or
            variation of any lease or licence other than licensing of its
            Intellectual Property in the ordinary course of business; or

      (c)   part with possession of the Secured Property; or

      (d)   allow a set-off or combination of accounts in respect of the Secured
            Property; or

      (e)   waive any of its rights or release any person from its obligations
            in connection with the Secured Property; or

      (f)   deal in any other way with the Secured Property or any interest in
            it, or allow any interest in it to arise or be varied.

6.3   The Chargor agrees to get GE Capital's consent before it does, or agrees
      to do, anything in clauses 6.2(a) to (f) in respect of the Secured
      Property over which the charge is floating except in the ordinary course
      of its business or as expressly permitted under the Transaction Documents.

6.4   The Chargor covenants with GE Capital in respect of all Marketable
      Securities included in the Secured Property:

      (a)   It will:

            (i)   notify GE Capital immediately if it becomes entitled to, or is
                  offered, New Rights; and

            (ii)  ensure that all documents relating to New Rights or arising
                  out of their subscription, taking up or exercise are delivered
                  to GE Capital.

      (b)   If GE Capital directs, it will promptly subscribe to, take up or
            exercise New Rights provided it has funds available to do so.

      (c)   It will remedy each defect in its title to those Marketable
            Securities.

      (d)   It will take or defend all legal proceedings which GE Capital
            requires to protect or recover those Marketable Securities.

      (e)   It will execute each document to which it is expressed to be a party
            in relation to anything required under this clause.

<PAGE>
                                       8


      (f)   It will duly pay all calls in respect of those Marketable
            Securities.

      (g)   Immediately on receipt by it or for its account, it will deliver to
            GE Capital each certificate, acceptance, contract note or transfer
            for those marketable securities.

      (h)   If GE Capital makes available a document it holds under this
            security relating to those Marketable Securities or New Rights for
            registration, stamping, exercise, acceptance or another purpose:

            (i)   it will ensure that the document or each resulting or
                  replacement document (as the case may be) is delivered
                  directly to GE Capital when available or returned; and

            (ii)  to the extent required by GE Capital, it will ensure that all
                  persons dealing with it have notice of this security.

            (GE Capital will make available any document which it holds on
            reasonable request by the Chargor for the purpose of recording,
            perfecting or preserving the title of the Chargor to Marketable
            Securities included in the Secured Property, or exercising rights
            attaching to those Marketable Securities in a manner consistent with
            GE Capital's interest under this security in those Marketable
            Securities, if arrangements satisfactory to GE Capital are in place
            to protect that interest.

      (i)   It will not do or omit to do anything which might render those
            Marketable Securities liable to forfeiture, cancellation, avoidance
            or loss or might otherwise prejudicially affect GE Capital's
            interest in them or their value.

      (j)   It will as soon as practicable provide to GE Capital certified
            copies of all reports and other documents received by it in its
            capacity as a holder of those Marketable Securities or relating in
            any way to those Marketable Securities including any report or
            notice of any meeting which the holder of those Marketable
            Securities is entitled to attend or vote at or both.

      (k)   (i)   Subject to sub-paragraph (ii), it will exercise its voting
                  rights in respect of those Marketable Securities in a prudent
                  manner.

            (ii)  It will not exercise its voting rights in respect of those
                  Marketable Securities while an Event of Default subsists or
                  after this security has been enforced, except with the consent
                  of GE Capital.

      (l)   (i)   It will ensure that all amounts received by it or for its
                  account as holder of or in relation to those Marketable
                  Securities, whether by dividend, distribution or otherwise,
                  are dealt with in accordance with the Transaction Documents.

            (ii)  If it receives an asset (other than money, new Shares or
                  entitlements to Shares) as holder of or in relation to those
                  Marketable Securities, it will immediately sell the asset at
                  its market value and the net proceeds of sale in accordance
                  with the Transaction Documents.

6.5   GE Capital need not:

      (a)   do anything to obtain payment of any dividend or other income in
            respect of the Shares or New Rights; or

      (b)   vote at any meeting of shareholders in connection with the Shares or
            New Rights; or

      (c)   exercise rights in respect of the Shares or New Rights; or

      (d)   sell the Shares or New Rights,

      even if it has reason to believe the value of the Shares or New Rights may
      fall. GE Capital is not responsible for loss as a result of such a failure
      to act or delay in so acting.

ADDITIONAL REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

7.1   The Chargor represents and warrants as follows.

      (a)   Each Share included in the Secured Property is fully paid.

      (b)   It has disclosed to GE Capital the Share capital in each company in
            which Shares included in the Secured Property are held. To the best
            of its knowledge and belief (having made due enquiry), no document,
            agreement, arrangement or understanding exists under which further
            Marketable Securities in those companies may be issued to a person
            or under which a person is entitled to call for the issue of
            Marketable Securities.

      (c)   It has provided GE Capital with all documents and information
            necessary for GE Capital to complete a valid and fully effective
            transfer of each Marketable Security included in the Secured
            Property.

OTHER SECURITY INTERESTS

8.1   If GE Capital consents to another Security Interest in the Secured
      Property (other than a Permitted Security Interest) and if GE Capital
      asks, then the Chargor agrees to get an agreement acceptable to GE Capital
      regarding the priority between this security and the other Security
      Interest.

8.2   If the Chargor does not get GE Capital's consent and agreement referred to
      in clause 8.1, GE Capital:

      (a)   need not make funds available under any Transaction Document; and

      (b)   may exercise any other rights that arise because the Chargor does
            not do so, such as the right to take possession of the Secured
            Property, to sell it or to otherwise deal with it.

8.3   The Chargor agrees to ensure that the amount secured under any other
      Security Interest (other than a Permitted Security Interest) in the
      Secured Property is not increased without GE Capital's consent.

<PAGE>
                                       10


8.4   The Chargor agrees to comply with its obligations in connection with any
      other Security Interest in the Secured Property.

8.5   For the purpose only of fixing priorities under section 282 of the
      Corporations Act 2001 (Cwlth), the prospective liabilities secured by this
      security relate to the liability to pay the Amount Owing up to the maximum
      amount of A$150,000,000. However, this clause does not affect any of the
      Chargor's obligations to GE Capital. GE Capital may also secure
      prospective liabilities in excess of this specified maximum amount.

8.6   GE Capital agrees that the Amount Owing is limited to A$7,000,000 as at
      the date of this document and maybe increased to an amount specified by GE
      Capital to the Chargor in writing from time to time.

ADMINISTRATIVE MATTERS

9.1   The Chargor agrees to deposit with GE Capital:

      (a)   any documents of title relating to the Secured Property over which
            the charge is fixed and the certificates which evidence title to the
            Shares (together with the number of forms of transfer for the Shares
            executed by the Chargor as transferor with the name of the
            transferee and the consideration and date left blank as GE Capital
            may require immediately when received by it); and

      (b)   any other documents GE Capital requests relating to the Secured
            Property.

9.2   GE Capital may register this security at the Chargor's expense at the
      Australian Securities and Investments Commission and in every jurisdiction
      outside Australia where the Secured Property is located.

9.3   The Chargor agrees to do anything GE Capital asks the Chargor to do (such
      as obtaining consents, signing and producing documents, producing receipts
      and getting documents completed and signed):

      (a)   to ensure the document is registered (and not just provisionally)
            under section 263 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cwlth) at its own
            cost; or

      (b)   to ensure , at its own cost, that this document is stamped for the
            proper amount in each state and territory of Australia in which this
            document is required to be stamped; or

      (c)   to provide additional or further security over the Secured Property
            for payment of the Amount Owing in the event that GE Capital forms
            the opinion, acting reasonably, that such is required to better
            protect its position ; or

      (d)   to enable GE Capital to register this security with the agreed
            priority; or

      (e)   to enable GE Capital to exercise its rights in connection with the
            Secured Property; or

      (f)   to enable GE Capital to register the power of attorney in clause 21
            or a power of attorney in the same terms as that clause.

9.4   The Chargor agrees that GE Capital may fill in any blanks in this document
      or any document relating to this document (such as Corporations Act 2001
      (Cwlth) forms or forms of transfer for the Secured Property).

COSTS, INDEMNITIES AND INTEREST

10.1  Clause 16 of the Facility Agreement applies as if set out in full in this
      document and as if:

      (a)   references to "each Obligor" or "an Obligor" are to "the Chargor";
            and

      (b)   clause references are read in context.

THINGS GE CAPITAL MAY DO AT ANY TIME

11.1  GE Capital may enter land and buildings owned or occupied by the Chargor,
      any place where the Secured Property is located, the Chargor's places of
      business and its registered office at reasonable times to:

      (a)   inspect the Secured Property; or

      (b)   find out whether the Chargor is complying with this document; or

      (c)   carry out GE Capital's rights under this document; or

      (d)   inspect and copy records relating to the Chargor, its Subsidiaries
            or the Secured Property; or

      (e)   investigate the Chargor's financial affairs or business or the
            financial affairs or business of its Subsidiaries.

11.2  Unless there is an emergency, GE Capital agrees to give the Chargor
      reasonable written notice before entering under clause 11.1. The Chargor
      agrees to help GE Capital to enter, such as by getting any consent
      necessary.

11.3  GE Capital may do anything which the Chargor should have done under this
      document but which the Chargor has either not done or in GE Capital's
      reasonable opinion has not done properly if GE Capital has requested the
      Chargor to act and it has failed to do so. If GE Capital does so, the
      Chargor agrees to pay GE Capital's reasonable costs when GE Capital asks.

11.4  GE Capital does not become a mortgagee in possession because it enters the
      Secured Property under clause 11.1 or exercises its rights under clause
      11.3.

DEFAULT - AND WHAT CAN HAPPEN

WHEN IS THE CHARGOR IN DEFAULT?

12.1  The Chargor is in default if an "Event of Default" as defined in the
      Facility Agreement occurs.

<PAGE>
                                       12


WHAT CAN HAPPEN IF THE CHARGOR IS IN DEFAULT?

13.1  If an Event of Default occurs and is subsisting, then GE Capital may elect
      at its option that the Amount Owing is either:

      (a)   payable on demand; or

      (b)   immediately due for payment.

13.2  After an Event of Default has occurred and subsists, GE Capital may do one
      or more of the following in addition to anything else the law allows it to
      do [as mortgagee or] chargee:

      (a)   sue the Chargor for the Amount Owing;

      (b)   take or give up possession of the Secured Property as often as GE
            Capital chooses;

      (c)   do anything an owner of the Secured Property could do, including
            selling it or conducting the Chargor's business;

      (d)   appoint one or more Receivers to do anything the law allows a
            Receiver to do and any of the things in paragraphs (a) to (c)
            inclusive above and clause 14.5;

      (e)   do anything that the Receiver could do under sub-paragraph (d).

RECEIVERS

14.1  In exercising GE Capital's Power to appoint a Receiver GE Capital may:

      (a)   appoint any Receiver to all or any part of the Secured Property or
            its income; and

      (b)   set a Receiver's pay at any figure GE Capital determines as
            appropriate (acting reasonably), remove a Receiver and appoint a new
            or additional Receiver.

14.2  If GE Capital appoints more than one Receiver, GE Capital may specify
      whether they may act individually or must act collectively.

14.3  The Receiver is the Chargor's agent unless GE Capital notifies the Chargor
      that the Receiver is to act as GE Capital's agent. The Chargor is solely
      responsible for anything done, or not done, by a Receiver and for the
      Receiver's remuneration and costs.

14.4  Unless the terms of appointment restrict a Receiver's Powers, the Receiver
      may do anything the law allows a Receiver to do and any of the things GE
      Capital may do under clause 13.2(a) to (c) inclusive.

14.5  In addition, the Receiver will have full Power to do all or any of the
      following:

      (a)   take possession of, collect and get in Secured Property and for that
            purpose to take proceedings (in the name of the Chargor or
            otherwise); and

      (b)   give up possession of Secured Property; and

      (c)   exercise all or any of GE Capital's Powers, rights, discretions and
            remedies under this document; and

      (d)   comply with the directions given by GE Capital; and

      (e)   carry on or agree to carry on the business of the Chargor in and
            with Secured Property and to stop doing so; and

      (f)   effect all repairs, purchases and insurances, and generally to do
            everything that the Chargor might do in the ordinary conduct of its
            business to:

            (i)   protect or improve Secured Property; or

            (ii)  obtain income or returns from Secured Property and to conduct
                  the Chargor's business; without being responsible for any
                  loss; and

      (g)   borrow from GE Capital any money that may be required for any of the
            purposes mentioned in paragraph (f) without the Receiver being bound
            to enquire whether the borrowing is necessary or proper or
            responsible for the misapplication or non-application of any money
            borrowed; and

      (h)   (in the name of the Chargor or otherwise) secure any money borrowed
            by mortgage or charge over Secured Property so that the mortgage or
            charge may rank in priority to, equally with or after this security
            without the Receiver being bound to enquire whether the granting of
            the mortgage or charge is necessary or proper; and

      (i)   hire out, lease or license Secured Property (including in the name
            of the Chargor) for any term at the rent or licence fee and on terms
            that seem desirable to the Receiver (with or without a purchase
            option and whether or not the Receiver has taken possession); and

      (j)   exercise all or any Powers, rights, discretions and remedies
            available under or in connection with the Secured Property
            (including rights available under the Corporations Act 2001 (Cwlth)
            or any other statute); and

      (k)   do everything necessary to obtain registration of the Secured
            Property in the Receiver's name or in the name of the Receiver's
            nominee; and

      (l)   settle, arrange and compromise any accounts, claims, questions or
            disputes that may arise in connection with the Chargor's business or
            the Secured Property or in any way relating to this document; and

      (m)   execute releases or other discharges in relation to a settlement,
            arrangement, or compromise referred to in paragraph (l); and

      (n)   sell or agree to sell (whether or not the Receiver has taken
            possession), exchange or otherwise dispose of (absolutely or
            conditionally) the Secured Property (or agree to do so):

<PAGE>
                                       14


            (i)   by public auction, private sale or tender for cash or on
                  credit;

            (ii)  in one lot or in parcels;

            (iii) with or without special conditions, (such as conditions as to
                  title or time or method of payment of purchase money)
                  including by allowing the purchase money to remain:

                  (A)   outstanding on the security of a mortgage over the
                        property sold or over any other property; or

                  (B)   owing without any security; and

            (iv)  on other terms the Receiver considers desirable (acting
                  reasonably), without being responsible for any loss; and

      (o)   execute transfers and assignments of Secured Property (including in
            the name of the Chargor), and do everything to complete any sale
            under paragraph (n) that the Receiver thinks necessary; and

      (p)   insure Secured Property that is of an insurable nature against risks
            of destruction, loss or damage for the amounts and on the terms that
            the Receiver thinks appropriate (acting reasonably); and

      (q)   sever fixtures belonging to the Chargor and sell them apart from any
            other part of the Secured Property; and

      (r)   engage employees, agents, advisers and contractors for any of the
            purposes of this clause on terms that the Receiver thinks
            appropriate (acting reasonably); and

      (s)   give receipts for all money and other property that may come into
            the hands of the Receiver in exercise of any Power given by this
            document; and

      (t)   carry out and enforce or otherwise obtain the benefit of all
            contracts:

            (i)   entered into or held by the Chargor in connection with the
                  Secured Property; or

            (ii)  entered into in exercise of the Powers given by this document;
                  and

      (u)   make debtors bankrupt and wind up companies and do everything in
            connection with any bankruptcy or winding up that the Receiver
            thinks desirable to recover or protect Secured Property; and

      (v)   do everything necessary to perform any undertaking of the Chargor in
            this document; and

            Chargor from Secured Property; and

      (x)   do or cause to be done everything that the Receiver thinks necessary

<PAGE>
                                       15


      (y)   do anything incidental to the exercise of any other Power; and

      (z)   take proceedings (including in the name of the Chargor) in
            connection with any of the above; and

      (aa)  delegate any of the Powers given to the Receiver by this clause to
            any person.

EXCLUSION OF TIME PERIODS

15.1  Neither GE Capital nor any Receiver need give the Chargor any notice or
      demand or allow time to elapse before exercising a right under this
      document or conferred by law (including a right to sell) unless the
      notice, demand or lapse of time is required by law and cannot be excluded
      or is otherwise provided for under the Transaction Documents. The
      provisions of Section 111 of the Conveyancing Act 1919 (NSW) and Section
      57 of the Real Property Act (NSW) requiring notice to be served and any
      similar provisions in any other legislation in any jurisdiction are
      expressly excluded to the extent permitted by law.

15.2  If the law requires that a period of notice must be given or a lapse of
      time must occur or be permitted before a right under this document or
      conferred by law may be exercised, then:

      (a)   when a period of notice or lapse of time is mandatory, that period
            of notice must be given or that lapse of time must occur or be
            permitted by GE Capital; or

      (b)   when the law provides that a period of notice or lapse of time may
            be stipulated or fixed by this security, then one day is stipulated
            and fixed as that period of notice or lapse of time including, if
            applicable, as the period of notice or lapse of time during which:

            (i)   a default must continue before a notice is given or
                  requirement otherwise made for payment of the Amount Owing or
                  the observance of other obligations under this security; and

            (ii)  a notice or request for payment of the Amount Owing or the
                  observance of other obligations under this document must
                  remain not complied with before GE Capital or a Receiver may
                  exercise its rights.

DISPOSAL OF THE SECURED PROPERTY IS FINAL

16.1  The Chargor agrees that if GE Capital or a Receiver sells or otherwise
      disposes of the Secured Property:

      (a)   then, provided GE Capital or the Receiver (as the case may be) has
            acted in accordance with its rights under this document and in
            accordance with all Laws, the Chargor will not challenge the
            acquirer's right to acquire the Secured Property and the Chargor
            will not seek to reclaim that property; and

      (b)   the person who acquires the Secured Property need not check whether
            GE Capital or the Receiver had the right to dispose of the Secured
            Property or whether GE Capital or the Receiver exercised that right
            properly.

                                       16


WHAT HAPPENS TO MONEY GE CAPITAL RECEIVES?

17.1  Money received under this security on enforcement of this security is to
      be applied in the following order:

      (a)   first in payment of all expenses or Taxes that GE Capital or a
            Receiver incurs in or incidental to the exercise or attempted
            exercise of a Power or otherwise in relation to any Transaction
            Document;

      (b)   then in payment of any other outgoings that GE Capital or the
            Receiver thinks it appropriate to pay;

      (c)   then in payment to the Receiver of any remuneration (whether by way
            of commission or otherwise);

      (d)   then in payment to GE Capital or a Receiver of any amount necessary
            to give effect to any indemnity contained in this document; and

      (e)   then in payment to GE Capital of the balance of the Amount Owing.

      However, if money received or enforcement of this security represents
      proceeds of an insurance claim, GE Capital (in its absolute discretion)
      may allow the Chargor to use it to reinstate the Secured Property or carry
      out work on it.

17.2  If, at the time GE Capital receives money under this security upon
      enforcement, any part of the Amount Owing is not then due for payment, GE
      Capital may retain until that part becomes due for payment or no longer
      falls within the definition of Amount Owing, an amount equal to that part
      and must deposit it in an interest bearing account. GE Capital must use it
      (and any net interest after Tax earned on it) to pay the Amount Owing when
      it becomes due for payment unless GE Capital is entitled to apply it in
      the manner provided in clause 17.1(a) to (d) inclusive then it may apply
      it in such manner or pay it (and any net interest after Tax earned on it)
      to the Chargor.

17.3  GE Capital may use any money received under this security upon enforcement
      towards paying any part of the Amount Owing it chooses, including by
      paying a later instalment before an earlier instalment. This applies even
      if that part falls due after GE Capital gives a notice of demand.

17.4  GE Capital agrees to pay any money remaining after the Amount Owing is
      paid either to the Chargor (which GE Capital may do by paying it into an
      account in the Chargor's name) or to another person entitled to it (such
      as another person with a Security Interest in the Secured Property). In
      particular, GE Capital may pay it to a person with a subsequent registered
      or unregistered Security Interest without incurring liability to the
      Chargor subject to clause 17.2. GE Capital need not pay the Chargor
      interest on any money remaining after the Amount Owing is paid.

17.5  The Chargor is only credited with money from the date GE Capital actually
      receives it (including, where GE Capital has appointed a Receiver, the
      date the Receiver pays money to GE Capital).

17.6  If any compensation becomes payable for Secured Property, GE Capital may:

<PAGE>
                                       17


      (a)   apply the sum received on account of any compensation, at the GE
            Capital's option, in or towards repayment of the Amount Owing;

      (b)   make, enforce, settle or compromise any claims relating to
            compensation; and

      (c)   execute any necessary assurances and releases in the name of the
            Chargor and GE Capital.

      If any compensation for the Secured Property comes into the hands of the
      Chargor before a final irrevocable discharge of this document, the Chargor
      must immediately pay it to GE Capital.

GE CAPITAL'S RIGHTS

HOW GE CAPITAL MAY EXERCISE ITS RIGHTS

18.1  GE Capital may enforce this security before it enforces other rights or
      remedies:

      (a)   against any other person; or

      (b)   under another document, such as another Security Interest.

      If GE Capital has more than one Security Interest, GE Capital may enforce
      them in any order GE Capital chooses.

18.2  If a Receiver does not exercise a right or remedy fully or at a given
      time, then the Receiver can still exercise it later.

18.3  A Receiver is not liable for loss caused by the exercise or attempted
      exercise of, failure to exercise, or delay in exercising, a right or
      remedy.

18.4  GE Capital's and any Receiver's rights and remedies under this document:

      (a)   are in addition to other rights and remedies given by law
            independently of this document; and

      (b)   may be exercised even if this involves a conflict of duty or GE
            Capital, or the Receiver has a personal interest in their exercise.

18.5  GE Capital's rights and remedies under this document may be exercised by
      any of its directors, any of its employees whose job title includes the
      word "manager" or any other person it authorises.

18.6  If GE Capital does not exercise a right or remedy fully or at a given
      time, GE Capital can still exercise it later.

18.7  GE Capital may but is not obliged to:

      (a)   notify any debtor or member of GE Capital or any other person of
            this document; or

<PAGE>
                                       18


      (b)   enforce payment of any money payable to the Chargor, or take any
            step or proceeding for any similar purpose.

THE CHARGOR'S OBLIGATIONS AND GE CAPITAL'S RIGHTS ARE UNAFFECTED

19.1  Rights given to GE Capital under this document and the Chargor's
      liabilities under it are not affected by any law that might otherwise
      affect them.

19.2  This document does not merge with or adversely affect, and is not
      adversely affected by, any of the following:

      (a)   another Security Interest or right or remedy to which GE Capital is
            entitled; or

      (b)   a judgment or order which GE Capital obtains against the Chargor in
            respect of any of the Amount Owing.

      GE Capital can still exercise its rights under this document as well as
      under the judgment, order, other Security Interest, right or remedy.

19.3  This document binds each person who signs as Chargor even if another
      person who was intended to sign does not sign it or is not bound by it.

REINSTATEMENT OF RIGHTS

20.1  Under law, a trustee in bankruptcy, liquidator or Controller may ask GE
      Capital to refund a payment GE Capital has received in connection with the
      Amount Owing (including an amount that was at any time part of the Amount
      Owing). To the extent GE Capital is obliged to, or GE Capital agrees to,
      make a refund GE Capital may treat the payment as if it had not been made.
      GE Capital is then entitled to its rights against the Chargor (including
      under this document) as if the payment had never been made. If GE Capital
      asks, the Chargor agrees to do everything necessary to restore to GE
      Capital any Security Interest GE Capital held from the Chargor immediately
      before the payment. This applies despite anything in this document.

POWER OF ATTORNEY

APPOINTMENT

21.1  After an Event of Default occurs and for so long as it is subsisting, the
      Chargor appoints GE Capital, each of GE Capital's employees whose job
      title includes the word "manager" and each Receiver under this document as
      its Attorney. Each Attorney may act individually or collectively. If GE
      Capital asks, the Chargor agrees to ratify anything an Attorney does under
      clause 21.2. The Chargor may not revoke these appointments.

POWERS

21.2  Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default and for so long as it is
      subsisting, an Attorney may at the Chargor's cost:

<PAGE>
                                       19


      (a)   do anything which the Chargor can lawfully authorise an Attorney to
            do in connection with this security or the Secured Property or which
            the Attorney believes is expedient to give effect to any of GE
            Capital's rights or a Receiver's rights or assist in the execution
            or exercise of any Power (including executing deeds, selling or
            leasing the Secured Property, otherwise dealing with the Secured
            Property and starting, conducting and defending legal proceedings);
            and

      (b)   demand, sue for, recover and give discharge for Secured Property;
            and

      (c)   commence, carry on, enforce, settle, arrange and compromise any
            proceedings to obtain or enforce the payment or delivery of Secured
            Property; and

      (d)   take any necessary proceedings to procure the bankruptcy or the
            winding up of any debtor of the Chargor in connection with the
            Secured Property, and attend and vote at meetings of creditors,
            receive dividends in any bankruptcy or winding up or appoint a proxy
            for any of these things; and

      (e)   compound, settle or compromise any debt owed to Chargor in
            connection with the Secured Property; and

      (f)   execute any deed of assignment, composition or release in connection
            with the Secured Property; and

      (g)   exercise all or any Powers, rights, discretions and remedies
            available under or in connection with the Secured Property
            (including rights available under the Corporations Act 2001
            (C'wth)or any other statute); and

      (h)   do anything else that the Chargor must or may do, or that GE Capital
            may do, under this document or by law; and

      (i)   delegate its Powers (including this Power) and revoke a delegation;
            and

      (j)   exercise its Powers even if this involves a conflict of duty or it
            has a personal interest in doing so; and

      (k)   do anything contemplated by this clause in its name, in the name of
            the Chargor or in the name of the both of them.

21.3  The Chargor gives the power of attorney in this clause 21:

      (a)   to secure performance by the Chargor of its obligations to GE
            Capital under this document; and

      (b)   for valuable consideration, receipt of which is acknowledged by the
            Chargor.

GENERAL

SET-OFF

23.1  The Chargor must not claim or set-off any money owing by GE Capital to it
      against the Amount Owing in full. At any time while an Event of Default
      subsists (unless waived by GE Capital), GE Capital may set off any amount
      due for payment by GE Capital to the Chargor against any amount due for
      payment by the Chargor to GE Capital under the Transaction Documents.

      the Chargor for as long as it things prudent and need not apply it towards

<PAGE>
                                       21


CERTIFICATES

23.3  GE Capital may give the Chargor a certificate about an amount payable or
      other matter in connection with a Transaction Document. A certificate
      containing reasonable detail of the calculation of the amount is (absent
      error) prima facie evidence of the amount.

23.4  GE Capital may rely on a certificate provided by any other person with a
      Security Interest in the Secured Property as to any amount that is owed to
      them.

PROMPT PERFORMANCE

23.5  If this document specifies when the Chargor must perform an obligation,
      the Chargor agrees to perform it by the time specified. The Chargor agrees
      to perform all other obligations promptly.

DISCRETION IN EXERCISING RIGHTS

23.6  GE Capital may exercise a right or remedy or give or refuse its consent in
      any way it considers appropriate, including by imposing conditions unless

      gives in connection with this document.

      exercise of, failure to exercise, or delay in exercising, a right or
      remedy.

INDEMNITIES

23.9  The indemnities in this security are continuing obligations, independent
      of the Chargor's other obligations under this security and continue after
      this security ends. It is not necessary for GE Capital to incur expense or
      make payment before enforcing a right of indemnity conferred by this
      document.

VARIATION AND WAIVER

      document, or right created under it, may not be waived or varied except in

      of the Chargor in connection with a Transaction Document with the result
      that GE Capital's rights, Powers or remedies are adversely affected
      (including by way of delay or postponement) is excluded except to the
      extent that its exclusion is prohibited or rendered ineffective by law.

APPLICABLE LAW

      Chargor and GE Capital submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the

      any other copy is signed by or binding upon any other party.

            result of anything referred to above),

      whether with or without the consent of the Chargor. References to ANY
      PERSON include another Chargor or any other person. None of the above
      paragraphs limits any of the others.

<PAGE>
                                       24


NO MARSHALLING

24.3  GE Capital is not obliged to marshal or appropriate in favour of the
      Chargor or to exercise, apply or recover:

      (a)   any Security Interest or guarantee (including in any Transaction
            Document) held by GE Capital at any time; or

      (b)   any of the funds or assets that GE Capital may be entitled to
            receive or have a claim on.

24.4  Until the Amount Owing has been irrevocably paid and discharged in full
      the Chargor is not entitled to and shall not:

            Interest or guarantee held by GE Capital at any time;

      (b)   either directly or indirectly prove in, claim or receive the benefit

            Security Interest in respect of any Amount Owing; or

      (c)   have or claim any right of contribution or indemnity from any other
            person who gives a guarantee or Security Interest in respect of any
            Amount Owing.

      The receipt of any distribution, dividend or other payment by GE Capital
      out of or relating to any Liquidation will not prejudice the right of GE
      Capital to recover the Amount Owing by enforcement of this security and
      each Collateral Security.

RESCISSION OF PAYMENT

24.5  Whenever for any reason (including under any law relating to Liquidation,
      fiduciary obligations or the protection of creditors):

      (a)   all or part of any transaction of any nature (including any payment
            or transfer) made during the term of this security which affects or

            received by it under any such transaction or the equivalent in value
            of that money or asset,

      GE Capital will immediately become entitled against the Chargor to all
      rights in respect of the Amount Owing and the Secured Property which it
      would have had if all or the relevant part of the transaction or receipt
      had not taken place. The Chargor shall indemnify GE Capital against any
      resulting loss, cost or expense. This clause continues to apply after this
      security is discharged.

            Document; or

      (b)   the provision of further accommodation to any other Chargor, and
            whether or not with the consent of or notice to the Chargor.

INDEMNITY

24.7  If any Amount Owing (including moneys which would have been Amount Owing
      if they were recoverable) is not recoverable from any other Chargor for
      any reason, including any legal limitation, disability or incapacity
      affecting any other Chargor or an obligation in any Transaction Document
      being or becoming unenforceable, void or illegal and whether or not:

      (a)   any transaction relating to the Amount Owing was void or illegal or
            has been subsequently avoided; or

      (b)   any matter or fact relating to that transaction was or ought to have
            been within the knowledge of GE Capital,

      the Chargor shall indemnify GE Capital in respect of that money and shall
      pay that money to GE Capital.
