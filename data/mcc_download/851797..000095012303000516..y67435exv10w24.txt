Securities.

                  SECTION 3.        REGISTERED EXCHANGE OFFER

                  (a)      Unless the Exchange Offer shall not be permitted by
applicable federal law (after the procedures set forth in Section 6(a)(i) below
have been complied with), the Company shall (i) cause to be filed with the
Commission as soon as practicable after the Closing Date, but in no event later
than 45 days after the Closing Date, the Exchange Offer Registration Statement,
(ii) use its best efforts to cause such Exchange Offer Registration Statement to
become effective at the earliest possible time, but in no event later than 120
days after the Closing Date, (iii) in connection with the foregoing, (A) file
all pre-effective amendments to such Exchange Offer Registration Statement as
may be necessary in order to cause such Exchange Offer Registration Statement to
become effective, (B) file, if applicable, a post-effective amendment to such
Exchange Offer Registration Statement pursuant to Rule 430A under the Act and
(C) cause all necessary filings, if any, in connection with the registration and
qualification of the Exchange Notes to be made under the Blue Sky laws of such
jurisdictions as are necessary to permit Consummation of the Exchange Offer, and
(iv) upon the effectiveness of such Exchange Offer Registration Statement,
commence and Consummate the Exchange Offer. The Exchange Offer shall be on the
appropriate form permitting registration of the Exchange Notes to be offered in
exchange for the Notes that are Transfer Restricted Securities and to permit
sales of Broker-Dealer Transfer Restricted Securities by Restricted
Broker-Dealers as contemplated by Section 3(c) below.

                  (b)      The Company shall use its best efforts to cause the
Exchange Offer Registration Statement to be effective continuously, and shall
keep the Exchange Offer referred to in the second paragraph of Section 3(c) open
for a period of not less than the minimum period required under applicable
federal and state securities laws to Consummate the Exchange Offer; provided,
however, that in no event shall such period be less than 20 Business Days. The
Company shall cause the Exchange Offer to comply with all applicable federal and
state securities laws. No securities other than the Exchange Notes shall be
included in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement. The Company shall use its
best efforts to cause

                                       3

<PAGE>

the Exchange Offer to be Consummated on the earliest practicable date after the
Exchange Offer Registration Statement has become effective, but in no event
later than 30 Business Days thereafter.

                  (c)      The Company shall include a "Plan of Distribution"
section in the Prospectus contained in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement
and indicate therein that any Restricted Broker-Dealer who holds Notes that are
Transfer Restricted Securities and that were acquired for the account of such
Broker-Dealer as a result of market-making activities or other trading
activities, may exchange such Notes (other than Transfer Restricted Securities
acquired directly from the Company or any Affiliate of the Company) pursuant to
the Exchange Offer; however, such Broker-Dealer may be deemed to be an
"underwriter" within the meaning of the Act and must, therefore, deliver a
prospectus meeting the requirements of the Act in connection with its initial
sale of each Exchange Note received by such Broker-Dealer in the Exchange Offer,
which prospectus delivery requirement may be satisfied by the delivery by such
Broker-Dealer of the Prospectus contained in the Exchange Offer Registration
Statement. Such "Plan of Distribution" section shall also contain all other
information with respect to such sales of Broker-Dealer Transfer Restricted
Securities by Restricted Broker-Dealers that the Commission may require in order
to permit such sales pursuant thereto, but such "Plan of Distribution" shall not
name any such Broker-Dealer or disclose the amount of Notes held by any such
Broker-Dealer, except to the extent required by the Commission.

                  The Company shall use its best efforts to keep the Exchange
Offer Registration Statement continuously effective, supplemented and amended as
required by the provisions of Section 6(c) below to the extent necessary to
ensure that it is available for sales of Broker-Dealer Transfer Restricted
Securities by Restricted Broker-Dealers, and to ensure that such Registration
Statement conforms with the requirements of this Agreement, the Act and the
policies, rules and regulations of the Commission as announced from time to
time, for a period of one year from the date on which the Exchange Offer is
Consummated (or such longer period if extended pursuant to Section 6(d) hereof).

                  The Company shall promptly provide sufficient copies of the
latest version of such Prospectus to such Restricted Broker-Dealers promptly
upon request, and in no event later than one day after such request, at any time
during such one-year period in order to facilitate such sales.

                  SECTION 4.        SHELF REGISTRATION

                  (a)      Shelf Registration. If (i) the Company is not
required to file an Exchange Offer Registration Statement with respect to the
Exchange Notes or permitted to Consummate the Exchange Offer because the
Exchange Offer is not permitted by applicable law or Commission policy (after
the procedures set forth in Section 6(a)(i) below have been complied with) or
(ii) any Holder shall notify the Company within 20 Business Days following the
Consummation of the Exchange Offer that (A) such Holder was prohibited by law or
Commission policy from participating in the Exchange Offer or (B) such Holder
may not resell the Exchange Notes acquired by it in the Exchange Offer to the
public without delivering a prospectus and the Prospectus contained in the
Exchange Offer Registration Statement is not appropriate or available for such
resales by such Holder or (C) such Holder is a Broker-Dealer and holds Notes
acquired directly from the Company or one of its affiliates, then the Company
shall (x) cause to be filed, on or prior to 60 days after the date on which the
Company determines that it is not required to file the Exchange Offer
Registration Statement pursuant to clause (i) above or 60 days after the date on
which the Company receives the notice specified in clause (ii) above (and in any
event within 120 days after the Closing Date), a shelf registration statement
pursuant to Rule 415 under the Act (which may be an amendment to the Exchange
Offer Registration Statement (in either event, the "Shelf Registration
Statement")), relating to all Transfer Restricted Securities the Holders of
which shall have provided the information required pursuant to Section 4(b)
hereof, and shall (y) use its best efforts to cause such Shelf Registration
Statement to be declared effective by the Commission as promptly as possible,
but not later

                                       4

<PAGE>

than 60 days after the date on which the Company becomes obligated to file such
Shelf Registration Statement. If, after the Company has filed an Exchange Offer
Registration Statement which satisfies the requirements of Section 3(a) above,
the Company is required to file and make effective a Shelf Registration
Statement solely because the Exchange Offer shall not be permitted under
applicable federal law, then the filing of the Exchange Offer Registration
Statement shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements of clause (x) above. Such
an event shall have no effect on the requirements of clause (y) above. The
Company shall use its best efforts to keep the Shelf Registration Statement
discussed in this Section 4(a) continuously effective, supplemented and amended
as required by and subject to the provisions of Sections 6(b) and (c) hereof to
the extent necessary to ensure that it is available for sales of Transfer
Restricted Securities by the Holders thereof entitled to the benefit of this
Section 4(a), and to ensure that it conforms with the requirements of this
Agreement, the Act and the policies, rules and regulations of the Commission as
announced from time to time, for a period of at least two years (as extended
pursuant to Section 6(d)) following the date on which such Shelf Registration
Statement first becomes effective under the Act, or such shorter period ending
when all Transfer Restricted Securities covered by the Shelf Registration
Statement cease to be Transfer Restricted Securities.

                  (b)      Provision by Holders of Certain Information in
Connection with the Shelf Registration Statement. No Holder may include any of
its Transfer Restricted Securities in any Shelf Registration Statement pursuant
to this Agreement unless and until such Holder furnishes to the Company in
writing, within 20 days after receipt of a request therefor, such information
specified in item 507 or 508 of Regulation S-K under the Act, as applicable, for
use in connection with any Shelf Registration Statement or Prospectus or
preliminary Prospectus included therein. No Holder shall be entitled to
liquidated damages pursuant to Section 5 hereof unless and until such Holder
shall have used its best efforts to provide all such information. Each Holder as
to which any Shelf Registration Statement is being effected agrees to furnish
promptly to the Company all information required to be disclosed in order to
make the information previously furnished to the Company by such Holder not
materially misleading.

                  SECTION 5.        LIQUIDATED DAMAGES

                  If (i) any Registration Statement required by this Agreement
is not filed with the Commission on or prior to the date specified for such
filing in this Agreement, (ii) any such Registration Statement has not been
declared effective by the Commission on or prior to the date specified for such
effectiveness in this Agreement, (iii) the Exchange Offer has not been
Consummated within 30 Business Days after the Exchange Offer Registration
Statement is first declared effective by the Commission or (iv) any Registration
Statement required by this Agreement is filed and declared effective but shall
thereafter cease to be effective or fail to be usable for its intended purpose
without being succeeded immediately by a post-effective amendment to such
Registration Statement that cures such failure and that is itself declared
effective immediately (each such event referred to in clauses (i) through (iv),
a "Registration Default"), then the Company hereby agrees to pay liquidated
damages to each Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities that are the subject of
such Registration Default with respect to the first 90-day period immediately
following the occurrence of such Registration Default, in an amount equal to
$.05 per week per $1,000 principal amount of Transfer Restricted Securities held
by such Holder for each week or portion thereof that the Registration Default
continues. The amount of the liquidated damages shall increase by an additional
$.05 per week per $1,000 in principal amount of Transfer Restricted Securities
with respect to each subsequent 90-day period until all Registration Defaults
have been cured, up to a maximum amount of liquidated damages of $.50 per week
per $1,000 principal amount of Transfer Restricted Securities. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth herein, (1) upon filing of the Exchange Offer
Registration Statement (and/or, if applicable, the Shelf Registration
Statement), in the case of (i) above, (2) upon the effectiveness of the Exchange
Offer Registration Statement (and/or, if applicable, the Shelf Registration
Statement), in the case of (ii) above, (3) upon Consummation of the Exchange
Offer, in the case of (iii) above, or (4) upon the filing of a post-effective
amendment to the

                                       5

<PAGE>

Registration Statement or an additional Registration Statement that causes the
Exchange Offer Registration Statement (and/or, if applicable, the Shelf
Registration Statement) to again be declared effective or made usable in the
case of (iv) above, the liquidated damages payable with respect to the Transfer
Restricted Securities as a result of such clause (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv), as
applicable, shall cease.

                  All accrued liquidated damages shall be paid in cash to the
Holders entitled thereto, in the manner provided for the payment of interest in
the Indenture, on each Interest Payment Date, as more fully set forth in the
Indenture and the Notes. All accrued liquidated damages shall be paid by wire
transfer of immediately available funds or by federal funds check and to Holders
of Certificated Securities by wire transfer to the accounts specified by them or
by mailing checks to their registered addresses (if no such accounts have been
specified) on each Damages Payment Date. All obligations of the Company set
forth in the preceding paragraph that are outstanding with respect to any
Transfer Restricted Security at the time such security ceases to be a Transfer
Restricted Security shall survive until such time as all such obligations with
respect to such security shall have been satisfied in full.

                  SECTION 6.        REGISTRATION PROCEDURES

                  (a)      Exchange Offer Registration Statement. In connection
with the Exchange Offer, the Company shall comply with all applicable provisions
of Section 6(c) below, shall use its best efforts to effect such exchange and to
permit the sale of Broker-Dealer Transfer Restricted Securities being sold in
accordance with the intended method or methods of distribution thereof, and
shall comply with all of the following provisions:

                  (i)      If, following the date hereof there has been
         published a change in Commission policy with respect to exchange offers
         such as the Exchange Offer, such that in the reasonable opinion of
         counsel to the Company there is a substantial question as to whether
         the Exchange Offer is permitted by applicable federal law, the Company
         hereby agrees to seek a no-action letter or other favorable decision
         from the Commission allowing the Company to Consummate an Exchange
         Offer for such Notes. The Company hereby agrees to pursue the issuance
         of such a decision to the Commission staff level. In connection with
         the foregoing, the Company hereby agrees to take all such other actions
         as are requested by the Commission or otherwise required in connection
         with the issuance of such decision, including without limitation (A)
         participating in telephonic conferences with the Commission, (B)
         delivering to the Commission staff an analysis prepared by counsel to
         the Company setting forth the legal bases, if any, upon which such
         counsel has concluded that such an Exchange Offer should be permitted
         and (C) diligently pursuing a resolution (which need not be favorable)
         by the Commission staff of such submission.

                  (ii)     As a condition to its participation in the Exchange
         Offer pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, each Holder shall
         furnish, upon the request of the Company, prior to the Consummation of
         the Exchange Offer, a written representation to the Company (which may
         be contained in the letter of transmittal contemplated by the Exchange
         Offer Registration Statement) to the effect that (A) it is not an
         affiliate of the Company, (B) it is not engaged in, and does not intend
         to engage in, and has no arrangement or understanding with any person
         to participate in, a distribution of the Exchange Notes to be issued in
         the Exchange Offer and (C) it is acquiring the Exchange Notes in its
         ordinary course of business. Each Holder hereby acknowledges and agrees
         that any Broker-Dealer and any such Holder using the Exchange Offer to
         participate in a distribution of the securities to be acquired in the
         Exchange Offer (1) could not under Commission policy as in effect on
         the date of this Agreement rely on the position of the Commission
         enunciated in Morgan Stanley and Co., Inc. (available June 5, 1991) and
         Exxon Capital Holdings Corporation (available May 13, 1988), as
         interpreted in the Commission's letter to Shearman & Sterling dated
         July 2, 1993, and similar no-action letters (including, if applicable,

                                       6

<PAGE>

         any no-action letter obtained pursuant to clause (i) above), and (2)
         must comply with the registration and prospectus delivery requirements
         of the Act in connection with a secondary resale transaction and that
         such a secondary resale transaction must be covered by an effective
         registration statement containing the selling security holder
         information required by Item 507 or 508, as applicable, of Regulation
         S-K if the resales are of Exchange Notes obtained by such Holder in
         exchange for Notes acquired by such Holder directly from the Company or
         an affiliate thereof.

                  (iii)    Prior to effectiveness of the Exchange Offer
         Registration Statement, the Company shall provide a supplemental letter
         to the Commission (A) stating that the Company is registering the
         Exchange Offer in reliance on the position of the Commission enunciated
         in Exxon Capital Holdings Corporation (available May 13, 1988), Morgan
         Stanley and Co., Inc. (available June 5, 1991) as interpreted in the
         Commission's letter to Shearman & Sterling dated July 2, 1993, and, if
         applicable, any no-action letter obtained pursuant to clause (i) above,
         (B) including a representation that the Company has not entered into
         any arrangement or understanding with any Person to distribute the
         Exchange Notes to be received in the Exchange Offer and that, to the
         best of the Company's information and belief, each Holder participating
         in the Exchange Offer is acquiring the Exchange Notes in its ordinary
         course of business and has no arrangement or understanding with any
         Person to participate in the distribution of the Exchange Notes
         received in the Exchange Offer and (C) any other undertaking or
         representation required by the Commission as set forth in any no-action
         letter obtained pursuant to clause (i) above.

                  (b)      Shelf Registration Statement. In connection with the
Shelf Registration Statement, the Company shall comply with all the provisions
of Section 6(c) below and shall use its best efforts to effect such registration
to permit the sale of the Transfer Restricted Securities being sold in
accordance with the intended method or methods of distribution thereof (as
indicated in the information furnished to the Company pursuant to Section 4(b)
hereof), and pursuant thereto the Company will prepare and file with the
Commission a Registration Statement relating to the registration on any
appropriate form under the Act, which form shall be available for the sale of
the Transfer Restricted Securities in accordance with the intended method or
methods of distribution thereof within the time periods and otherwise in
accordance with the provisions hereof.

                  (c)      General Provisions. In connection with any
Registration Statement and any related Prospectus required by this Agreement to
permit the sale or resale of Transfer Restricted Securities (including, without
limitation, any Exchange Offer Registration Statement and the related
Prospectus, to the extent that the same are required to be available to permit
sales of Broker-Dealer Transfer Restricted Securities by Restricted
Broker-Dealers), the Company shall:

                  (i)      use its best efforts to keep such Registration
         Statement continuously effective and provide all requisite financial
         statements for the period specified in Section 3 or 4 of this
         Agreement, as applicable. Upon the occurrence of any event that would
         cause any such Registration Statement or the Prospectus contained

                           Broker Dealers may reasonably request;

                                    (2)      an opinion, dated the date of
                           Consummation of the Exchange Offer or the date of
                           effectiveness of the Shelf Registration Statement, as
                           the case may be, of counsel for the Company covering
                           matters similar to those set forth in paragraphs (h)
                           and (i) of Section 7 of the Purchase Agreement and
                           such other matters as the Holders, underwriters
                           and/or Restricted Broker Dealers may reasonably
                           request, and in any event including a statement to
                           the effect that such counsel has participated in
                           conferences with officers and other representatives
                           of the Company, representatives of the independent
                           public accountants for the Company and have
                           considered the matters required to be stated therein
                           and the statements contained therein, although such
                           counsel has not independently verified the accuracy,
                           completeness or fairness of such statements; and that
                           such counsel advises that, on the basis of the
                           foregoing (relying as to materiality to a large
                           extent upon facts provided to such counsel by
                           officers and other representatives of the Company and
                           without independent check or verification), no facts
                           came to such counsel's attention that caused such
                           counsel to believe that the applicable Registration
                           Statement, at the time such Registration Statement or
                           any post-effective amendment thereto became effective
                           and, in the case of the Exchange Offer Registration
                           Statement, as of the date of Consummation of the
                           Exchange Offer, contained an untrue statement of a
                           material fact or omitted to state a material fact
                           required to be stated therein or necessary to make
                           the statements therein not misleading, or that the
                           Prospectus contained in such Registration Statement
                           as of its date and, in the case of the opinion dated
                           the date of Consummation of the Exchange Offer, as of
                           the date of Consummation, contained an untrue
                           statement of a material fact or omitted to state a
                           material fact necessary in order to make the
                           statements therein, in the light of the circumstances
                           under which they were made, not misleading. Without
                           limiting the foregoing, such counsel may state
                           further that such counsel assumes no responsibility
                           for, and has not independently verified, the
                           accuracy, completeness or fairness of the financial
                           statements, notes and schedules and other financial
                           data included in any Registration Statement
                           contemplated by this Agreement or the related
                           Prospectus; and

                                    (3)      a customary comfort letter, dated
                           as of the date of effectiveness of the Shelf
                           Registration Statement or the date of Consummation of
                           the Exchange Offer, as the case may be, from the
                           Company's independent accountants, in the customary
                           form and covering matters of the type customarily
                           covered in comfort letters to underwriters in
                           connection with primary underwritten offerings, and
                           affirming the matters set forth in the comfort
                           letters delivered pursuant to Section 7 of the
                           Purchase Agreement, without exception;

                  pursuant to said Section; and

                           (C)      deliver such other documents and
                  certificates as may be reasonably requested by the selling
                  Holders, the underwriter(s), if any, and Restricted Broker

                  The above shall be done at each closing under such
underwriting or similar agreement, as and to the extent required thereunder, and

(A)(1) above cease to be true and correct, the Company shall so advise the
underwriter(s), if any, the selling Holders and each Restricted Broker-Dealer
promptly and if requested by such Persons, shall confirm such advice in writing;

         acts or things necessary or advisable to enable the disposition in such
         jurisdictions of the Transfer Restricted Securities covered by the
         applicable Registration Statement; provided, however, that the Company
         shall not be required to register or qualify as a foreign corporation
         where it is not now so qualified or to take any action that would
         subject it to the service of process in suits or to taxation, other

         disposition of such Transfer Restricted Securities;

                  (xviii)  otherwise use its best efforts to comply with all
         applicable rules and regulations of the Commission, and make generally
         available to its security holders with regard to any applicable
         Registration Statement, as soon as practicable, a consolidated earnings
         statement meeting the requirements of Rule 158 (which need not be
         audited) covering a twelve-month period beginning after the effective
         date of the Registration Statement (as such term is defined in
         paragraph (c) of Rule 158 under the Act);

                  (xix)    cause the Indenture to be qualified under the TIA
         not later than the effective date of the first Registration Statement
         required by this Agreement and, in connection therewith, cooperate with
         the Trustee and the Holders of Notes to effect such changes to the
         Indenture as may be required for such Indenture to be so qualified in
         accordance with the terms of the TIA; and execute and use its best
         efforts to cause the Trustee to execute, all documents that may be
         required to effect such changes and all other forms and documents
         required to be filed with the Commission to enable such Indenture to be
         so qualified in a timely manner; and

                  (xx)     provide promptly to each Holder upon request each
         document filed with the Commission pursuant to the requirements of
         Section 13 or Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act.

                  (d)      Restrictions on Holders. Each Holder agrees by
acquisition of a Transfer Restricted Security that, upon receipt of the notice
referred to in Section 6(c)(i) or any notice from the Company of the existence
of any fact of the kind described in Section 6(c)(iii)(C) or (D) hereof, such
Holder will forthwith discontinue disposition of Transfer Restricted Securities
pursuant to the applicable Registration Statement until such Holder's receipt of
the copies of the supplemented or amended Prospectus contemplated by Section
6(c)(xv) hereof, or until it is advised in writing by the Company that the use
of the Prospectus may be resumed, and has received copies of any additional or
supplemental filings that are incorporated by reference in the Prospectus (the
"Advice"). If so directed by the Company, each Holder will deliver to the
Company (at the Company's expense) all copies, other than permanent file copies
then in such Holder's possession, of the Prospectus covering such Transfer
Restricted Securities that was current at the time of receipt of either such
notice. In the event the Company shall give any such notice, the time period
regarding the effectiveness of such Registration Statement set forth in Section
3 or 4 hereof, as applicable, shall be extended by the number of days during the
period from and including the date of the giving of such notice pursuant to
Section 6(c)(i) or Section

                                       12

<PAGE>

6(c)(iii)(D) hereof to and including the date when each selling
Holder covered by such Registration Statement shall have received the copies of
the supplemented or amended Prospectus contemplated by Section 6(c)(xv) hereof
or shall have received the Advice.

                  SECTION 7.        REGISTRATION EXPENSES

                  (a)      All expenses incident to the Company's performance of
or compliance with this Agreement will be borne by the Company, regardless of
whether a Registration Statement becomes effective, including without
limitation: (i) all registration and filing fees and expenses (including filings
made by the Initial Purchaser or any Holder with the NASD and, if applicable,
the fees and expenses of any "qualified independent underwriter" and its counsel
that may be required by the rules and regulations of the NASD); (ii) all fees
and expenses of compliance with federal securities and state Blue Sky or
securities laws; (iii) all expenses of printing (including printing certificates
for the Exchange Notes to be issued in the Exchange Offer and printing of
Prospectuses), messenger and delivery services and telephone; (iv) all
reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel for the Company and the Holders
(subject to the provisions of Section 7(b) below); (v) all application and
filing fees in connection with listing the Notes on a national securities
exchange or automated quotation system pursuant to the requirements hereof; and
(vi) all fees and disbursements of independent certified public accountants of
the Company (including the expenses of any special audit and comfort letters
required by or incident to such performance).

                  The Company will, in any event, bear its internal expenses
(including, without limitation, all salaries and expenses of its officers and
employees performing legal or accounting duties), the expenses of any annual
audit and the fees and expenses of any Person, including special experts,
retained by the Company.

                  (b)      In connection with any Registration Statement
required by this Agreement (including, without limitation, the Exchange Offer
Registration Statement and the Shelf Registration Statement), the Company will
reimburse the Initial Purchaser and the Holders being tendered in the Exchange
Offer and/or resold pursuant to the "Plan of Distribution" contained in the
Exchange Offer Registration Statement or registered pursuant to the Shelf
Registration Statement, as applicable, for the reasonable fees and disbursements
of not more than one counsel, who shall be chosen by the Holders of a majority
in principal amount of the Transfer Restricted Securities for whose benefit such
Registration Statement is being prepared.

                  SECTION 8.        INDEMNIFICATION

                  (a)      The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless (i)
each Holder and (ii) each Person, if any, who controls (within the meaning of
Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act) any Holder (any of the
Persons referred to in this clause (ii) being hereinafter referred to as a
"controlling person") and (iii) the respective officers, directors, partners,
employees, representatives and agents of any Holder or any controlling person
(any Person referred to in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) may hereinafter be referred
to as an "Indemnified Holder"), to the fullest extent lawful, from and against
any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, judgments, actions and
expenses (including without limitation and as incurred, reimbursement of all
reasonable costs of investigating, preparing, pursuing or defending any claim or
action, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body,
commenced or threatened, including the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel
to any Indemnified Holder) directly or indirectly caused by, related to, based
upon, arising out of or in connection with any untrue statement or alleged
untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Registration Statement,
preliminary prospectus or Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto),
or any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not

                                       13

<PAGE>

misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or
expenses are caused by an untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue
statement or omission that is made in reliance upon and in conformity with
information relating to any of the Holders furnished in writing to the Company
by any of the Holders expressly for use therein; provided, however, that the
Company shall not be required to indemnify any such Person if such untrue
statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission was contained or
made in any preliminary prospectus and corrected in the Prospectus or any
amendment or supplement thereto and the Prospectus does not contain any other
untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission of a
material fact that was the subject matter of the related proceeding and any such
loss, liability, claim, damage or expense suffered or incurred by the
Indemnified Holder resulted from any action, claim or suit by any Person who
purchased Transfer Restricted Securities or Exchange Notes which are the subject
thereof from such Indemnified Holder and it is established in the related
proceeding that such Indemnified Holder failed to deliver or provide a copy of
the Prospectus (as amended or supplemented) to such Person with or prior to the
confirmation of the sale of such Transfer Restricted Securities or Exchange
Notes sold to such Person if required by applicable law, unless such failure to
deliver or provide a copy of the Prospectus (as amended or supplemented) was a
result of noncompliance by the Company with Section 6 of this Agreement.

                  In case any action or proceeding (including any governmental
or regulatory investigation or proceeding) shall be brought or asserted against
any of the Indemnified Holders with respect to which indemnity may be sought
against the Company, such Indemnified Holder (or the Indemnified Holder
controlled by such controlling person) shall promptly notify the Company in
writing (provided, that the failure to give such notice shall not relieve the
Company of its obligations pursuant to this Agreement, unless and only to the
extent that such failure directly results in the loss or compromise of any
material rights or defenses by the Company and the Company was not otherwise
aware of such action or claim). In such event, the Company shall retain counsel
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Holders to represent the Indemnified
Holders and any others the Company may reasonably designate in such proceeding
and shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses actually incurred by such counsel
related to such proceeding. The Company shall not, in connection with any one
such action or proceeding or separate but substantially similar or related
actions or proceedings in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general
allegations or circumstances, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of
more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to any local counsel) at
any time for such Indemnified Holders, which firm shall be designated by the
Holders. The Company shall be liable for any settlement of any such action or
proceeding effected with the Company's prior written consent, which consent
shall not be withheld unreasonably, and the Company agrees to indemnify and hold
harmless each Indemnified Holder from and against any loss, claim, damage,
liability or expense by reason of any settlement of any action effected with the
written consent of the Company. The Company shall not, without the prior written
consent of each Indemnified Holder, which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
settle or compromise or consent to the entry of judgment in or otherwise seek to
terminate any pending or threatened action, claim, litigation or proceeding in
respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder
(whether or not any Indemnified Holder is a party thereto), unless such
settlement, compromise, consent or termination includes an unconditional release
of each Indemnified Holder from all liability arising out of such action, claim,
litigation or proceeding.

                  (b)      Each Holder agrees, severally and not jointly, to
indemnify and hold harmless the Company, and its directors, officers, and any
Person controlling (within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of
the Exchange Act) the Company, and the respective officers, directors, partners,
employees, representatives and agents of each such Person, to the same extent as
the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each of the Indemnified Holders, but
only with respect to claims and actions based on information relating to such
Holder furnished in writing by such Holder expressly for use in any Registration
Statement, preliminary prospectus or Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement
thereto). In case any action or proceeding shall be brought against the Company
or its directors or officers or any

                                       14

<PAGE>

such controlling person in respect of which indemnity may be sought against a
Holder, such Holder shall have the rights and duties given the Company, and the
Company, such directors or officers or such controlling person shall have the
rights and duties given to each Holder by the preceding paragraph. The liability
of any Holder under this paragraph shall in no event exceed the proceeds
received by such Holder from sales of Transfer Restricted Securities or Exchange
Notes giving rise to such obligations.

                  (c)      If the indemnification provided for in this Section 8
is unavailable to an indemnified party under Section 8(a) or Section 8(b) hereof
(other than by reason of exceptions provided in those Sections) in respect of
any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to therein, then
each applicable indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified
party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party
as a result of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses in such
proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the
Company, on the one hand, and the Holders, on the other hand, from their sale of
Transfer Restricted Securities or if such allocation is not permitted by
applicable law, the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and of the
Indemnified Holder, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or
omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or
expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative
benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Indemnified Holders on
the other hand shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total
proceeds from the offering (net of discounts and commissions but before
deducting expenses) of the Notes received by the Company bears to the total
proceeds received by such Indemnified Holder from the sale of Transfer
Restricted Securities or Exchange Notes, as the case may be. The relative fault
of the Company, on the one hand, and of the Indemnified Holder, on the other
hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the
untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged
omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company
or by the Indemnified Holder and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access
to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission
and any other equitable consideration appropriate in the circumstances. The
amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and expenses referred to above shall be deemed to include, subject
to the limitations set forth in the second paragraph of Section 8(a), any legal
or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with
investigating or defending any action or claim.

                  The Company and each Holder agree that it would not be just
and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8(c) were determined by
pro rata allocation (even if the Holders were treated as one entity for such
purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the
equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. The
amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses,
claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to in the immediately
preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set
forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified
party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, no Holder or its related
Indemnified Holders shall be required to contribute, in the aggregate, any
amount in excess of the amount by which the total received by such Holder with
respect to the sale of its Transfer Restricted Securities pursuant to a
Registration Statement exceeds the amount of any damages which such Holder has
otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue
statement or omission or alleged omission. No Person guilty of fraudulent
misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be
entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent
misrepresentation. The Holders' obligations to contribute pursuant to this
Section 8(c) are several in proportion to the respective principal amount of
Notes held by each of the Holders hereunder and not joint.

                  SECTION 9.        RULE 144A

                  The Company hereby agrees with each Holder, for so long as any
Transfer Restricted Securities remain outstanding and during any period in which
the Company is not subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange
Act, to make available, upon request of any Holder, to any Holder or beneficial
owner of Transfer Restricted Securities in connection with any sale thereof and
any prospective purchaser of such Transfer Restricted Securities designated by
such Holder or beneficial owner, the information required by Rule l44A(d)(4)
under the Act in order to permit resales of such Transfer Restricted Securities
pursuant to Rule 144A.

                  SECTION 10.       UNDERWRITTEN REGISTRATIONS

                  No Holder may participate in any Underwritten Registration
hereunder unless such Holder (a) agrees to sell such Holder's Transfer
Restricted Securities on the basis provided in any underwriting arrangements
approved by the Persons entitled hereunder to approve such arrangements and (b)
completes and executes all reasonable questionnaires, powers of attorney,
indemnities, underwriting agreements and other documents required under the
terms of such underwriting arrangements.

                  SECTION 11.       SELECTION OF UNDERWRITERS

                  For any Underwritten Offering, the investment banker or
investment bankers and manager or managers for any Underwritten Offering that
will administer such offering will be selected by the Holders of a majority in
aggregate principal amount of the Transfer Restricted Securities included in
such offering and reasonably acceptable to the Company. Such investment bankers
and managers are referred to herein as the "underwriters."

                  SECTION 12.       MARKET-MAKING PROSPECTUSES

                  (a)      Following the consummation of any Exchange Offer or
the effectiveness of a Shelf Registration Statement and for so long as the Notes
are outstanding if, in the reasonable judgment of the Initial Purchaser, the
Initial Purchaser or any of its affiliates (as such term is defined in the rules
and regulations under the Act) are required to deliver a prospectus in
connection with sales of, or market-making activities with respect to, such
securities, the Company agrees (A) to periodically amend the applicable
Registration Statement so that the information contained therein complies with
the requirements of Section 10(a) of the Act, (B) to amend the applicable
Registration Statement or supplement the related prospectus or the documents
incorporated therein when necessary to reflect any material changes in the
information provided therein so that the Registration Statement and the
prospectus will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances existing as of the date the prospectus is so
delivered, not misleading and (C) to provide the Initial Purchaser with copies
of each such amendment or supplement as the Initial Purchaser may reasonably
request.

                  SECTION 13.       MISCELLANEOUS

                  (a)      Remedies. Each Holder, in addition to being entitled
to exercise all rights provided herein, in the Indenture, the Purchase Agreement
or granted by law, including recovery of liquidated or other damages, will be
entitled to specific performance of its rights under this Agreement. The Company
agrees that monetary damages would not be adequate compensation for any loss
incurred by reason of a breach by it of the provisions of this Agreement and
hereby agrees to waive the defense in any action for specific performance that a
remedy at law would be adequate.

                                       16

<PAGE>

                  (b)      No Inconsistent Agreements. The Company will not, on
or after the date of this Agreement, enter into any agreement with respect to
its securities that is inconsistent with the rights granted to the Holders in
this Agreement or otherwise conflicts with the provisions hereof. The Company
hereby represents and warrants that the rights granted to the Holders hereunder
do not in any way conflict with and are not inconsistent with the rights granted
to the holders of the Company's securities under any agreement in effect on the
date hereof.

                  (c)      Adjustments Affecting the Notes. The Company will not
take any action, or voluntarily permit any change to occur, with respect to the
Notes or Exchange Notes that would materially and adversely affect the ability
of the Holders to Consummate any Exchange Offer.

                  (d)      Amendments and Waivers. The provisions of this
Agreement may not be amended, modified or supplemented, and waivers or consents
to or departures from the provisions hereof may not be given unless (i) the
consent of the Company is obtained, which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
(ii) in the case of Section 5 hereof and this Section 13(d)(i), the Company has
obtained the written consent of Holders of all outstanding Transfer Restricted
Securities and (iii) in the case of all other provisions hereof, the Company has
obtained the written consent of Holders of a majority of the outstanding
principal amount of Transfer Restricted Securities. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, a waiver or consent to departure from the provisions hereof that
relates exclusively to the rights of Holders whose securities are being tendered
pursuant to the Exchange Offer and that does not affect directly or indirectly
the rights of other Holders whose securities are not being tendered pursuant to
such Exchange Offer may be given by the Holders of a majority of the outstanding
principal amount of Transfer Restricted Securities subject to such Exchange
Offer.

                  (e)      Notices. All notices and other communications
provided for or permitted hereunder shall be made in writing by hand-delivery,

                  (f)      Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall inure to

unless and to the extent such successor or assign acquired Transfer Restricted
Securities directly from such Holder.

                  (g)      Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any
number of counterparts and by the parties hereto in separate counterparts, each

agreement and understanding of the parties hereto in respect of the subject
matter contained herein. There are no restrictions, promises, warranties or
undertakings, other than those set forth or referred to herein with respect to
the registration rights granted with respect to the Transfer Restricted
Securities. This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings
between the parties with respect to such subject matter.

                  (l)      Underwriting Agreement. Notwithstanding the
provisions of Section 6 hereof, in the event of a Shelf Registration pursuant to
Section 4 hereof, to the extent that the Holders shall enter into an
underwriting or similar agreement, which agreement contains provisions covering
one or more issues addressed in such Section 4 with substantially similar
effect, the provisions contained in such Sections addressing such issue or
issues shall be of no force or effect with respect to the registration of
securities being effected in connection with such underwriting or similar
agreement.

                  (m)      Termination. This Agreement shall terminate and be of
no further force or effect when there shall not be any Transfer Restricted
