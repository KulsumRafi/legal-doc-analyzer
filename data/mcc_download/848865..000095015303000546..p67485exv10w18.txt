      status of any Securitization Vehicle as a separate entity be in any
      respect disregarded; provided, however, that the provisions of this

      similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and by general
      principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is
      considered in a proceeding at law or in equity).

            (b) The representations and warranties set forth in Article III of
