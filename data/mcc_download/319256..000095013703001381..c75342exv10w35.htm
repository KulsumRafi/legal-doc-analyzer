6(b)), Sears agrees to pay, in lieu of any salary or bonus that Executive may
be entitled to during the Employment Period pursuant to Section&nbsp;3, severance,
subject to the provisions of Sections&nbsp;12(e) and 16 herein, to Executive in an
amount equal to: (i)&nbsp;an annual bonus, based on actual results for the year in

Compensation Plan or any successor annual incentive program. A lump sum
payment will be made for any vacation benefits that accrued prior to the end of

such employer&#146;s health benefits plan or program, the medical and dental
benefits provided by Sears hereunder shall be secondary to such employer&#146;s
health benefits plan or program in accordance with the terms of Sears health
benefit plans.

as to effectuate as nearly as possible in a valid and enforceable way the
provisions hereof, or shall be deemed excised from this Agreement, as the case
may require, and this Agreement shall be construed and enforced to the maximum
extent permitted by law, as if such provision(s) had been originally

Executive hereby: (a)&nbsp;submits to the personal jurisdiction of such courts; (b)
consents to the service of process in connection with any action, suit, or
proceeding against Executive; and (c)&nbsp;waives any other requirement (whether
imposed by statute, rule of court, or otherwise) with respect to personal

trial on any claim contending that this Agreement or the General Release and
Waiver is illegal or unenforceable in whole or in part, and Executive agrees to

agrees to try such claim to the court or tribunal without use of a jury or
advisory jury.

</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;23.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tax Withholding. All compensation paid or provided to Executive under
this Agreement shall be subject to any applicable federal, state or local
income and employment tax withholding requirements.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;24.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Superseding Agreement. If any provision of this Agreement conflicts
with any other agreement, policy, plan, practice or other Sears document, then
the provisions of this Agreement will control. Executive shall not be eligible
for any benefits under the Sears Transition Pay Plan or any successor severance
plan or program. This Agreement will supersede any prior agreement between
Executive and Sears with respect to the subject matter contained herein and may
be amended only by a writing signed by an authorized officer of Sears.

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;25.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assignment of Rights. Sears may assign its rights under this
Agreement to any successor in interest, whether by merger, consolidation, sale

result from any breach or threatened breach by Executive of the provisions of
this Agreement, and monetary damages alone would not provide adequate relief
for any such breach. Accordingly, if Executive breaches this Agreement,
injunctive relief in favor of Sears is proper without the necessity of Sears
posting bond. Moreover, any award of injunctive relief shall preclude Sears
from seeking or recovering any lawful compensatory damages which may have
resulted from a breach of this Agreement, including a forfeiture of any future
payments and a return of any payments already received by me.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;28.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Entire Agreement. Executive understands that this Agreement contains
the entire agreement and understanding between Sears and Executive with respect
to the provisions contained in this Agreement, and that no representations,
promises, agreements, or understandings, written or oral, related thereto which
are not contained in this Agreement will be given any force or effect. No
change or modification of this Agreement will be valid or binding unless it is
in writing and signed by the party against whom the change or modification is
sought to be enforced. Executive further understands that even if Sears waives
or fails to enforce any provision of this Agreement in one instance, that will
not constitute a waiver of any other provisions of this Agreement at this time,
or a waiver of that provision at any other time.
