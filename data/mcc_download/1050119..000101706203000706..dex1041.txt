     ----------

4.1  Completion of the sale and purchase of the Shares shall take place on the

     enforce any term of this Agreement which expressly or by implication
     confers a benefit on that person without the express prior agreement in
     writing of the Sellers and the Buyer, which agreement must refer to this
     clause 5.

6    Further Assurance
     -----------------

6.1  Without prejudice to any restriction or limitation on the extent of the
     Sellers' obligations under this Agreement each of the Sellers shall from
     time to time do or, so far as he/she is able, procure the doing of all such
     acts and/or execute or, so far as he/she is able, procure the execution of
     all such documents in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Purchaser as
     the Purchaser may reasonably consider necessary to transfer the Shares
     owned by that Seller to the Purchaser or otherwise to give the Purchaser
     the full benefit of this Agreement.

6.2  Each Seller declares that for so long as he or she remains the registered
     holder of any of the Shares after Completion he or she shall:

     (a)  hold the Shares and the dividends and other distributions of profits

          after Completion and all rights arising out of or in connection with
          them in trust for the Purchaser and any successors in title to the
          Purchaser; and

     (b)  deal with and dispose of the Shares and all such dividends,
          distributions and related rights as the Purchaser or any such
          successor may direct.

     purpose of signing any written resolution (or receiving notices of
     attending and voting at all meetings) of the members of the Company from
     Completion to the day on which the Purchaser or its nominee is entered in
     the register of members of the Company as the holder of the Shares and for
     that purpose each Seller authorises:

                                       3
