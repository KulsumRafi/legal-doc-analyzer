prepayment pursuant to this Section 8.3(b)(i) shall be delivered by any holder
of the Notes which was entitled to, but did not receive, such Company Notice to
the Company after such holder has actual knowledge of such Change of
Control.&nbsp; On the date (the <i>&quot;Change of Control Delayed Prepayment Date&quot;</i>)
designated in such holder's notice (which shall be not more than 90&nbsp;days
nor less than 30&nbsp;days following the date of such holder's notice), the
Company shall prepay in full all of the Notes held by such holder, together
with accrued interest thereon to the date of prepayment.&nbsp; If the holder of any Note gives any notice
pursuant to this Section 8.3(b)(i), the Company shall give a Company Notice
within three Business Days of receipt of such notice and identify the Change of
Control Delayed Prepayment Date to all other holders of the Notes and each of
such other holders shall then and thereupon have the right to accept the
Company's offer to prepay the Notes held by such holder in full and require
prepayment of such Notes by delivery of a Noteholder Notice within 20&nbsp;days
following receipt of such Company Notice; <i>provided</i>
only that any date for prepayment of such holder's Notes shall be the Change of
Control Delayed Prepayment Date.&nbsp; On the
Change of Control Delayed Prepayment Date, the Company shall prepay in full the
Notes of each holder thereof which has accepted such offer of prepayment at a
prepayment price equal to 100% of the outstanding principal amount of the Notes
so to be prepaid and accrued interest thereon to the date of such prepayment.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii)
Compliance with the provisions of this Section
8.3(b) shall not be deemed to constitute a waiver of, or consent to, any
Default or Event of Default caused by any violation of the provisions of
Section 8.3(a).</p>

of Control&quot; </i>means if any person (as such term is used in section 13(d) and
section&nbsp;14(d)(2) of the Exchange Act as in effect on the date of the
Closing) or related persons constituting a group (as such term is used in Rule
13d-5 under the Exchange Act), become the &quot;beneficial owners&quot; (as such term is
used in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act as in effect on the date of the
Closing), directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the issued and
outstanding common stock of the Company.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Section&nbsp;8.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Allocation of Partial Prepayments</i>.&nbsp; In the case of each partial prepayment of
the Notes (other than partial payment under Section&nbsp;8.3), the principal
amount of the Notes to be prepaid shall be allocated among all of the Notes at
the time outstanding in proportion, as nearly as practicable, to the respective
unpaid principal amounts thereof.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Section&nbsp;8.5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maturity; Surrender, etc</i>.&nbsp; In the case of each prepayment of Notes
pursuant to this Section&nbsp;8, the principal amount of each Note to be
prepaid shall mature and become due and payable on the date fixed for such
prepayment, together with interest on such principal amount accrued to such
date and the applicable Make-Whole Amount, if any.&nbsp; From and after such date, unless the Company shall fail to pay
such principal amount when so due and payable, together with the interest and
Make-Whole Amount, if any, as aforesaid, interest on such principal amount
shall cease to accrue.&nbsp; Any Note paid or
prepaid in full shall be surrendered to the Company and cancelled and shall not
be reissued, and no Note shall be issued in lieu of any prepaid principal
amount of any Note.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Section&nbsp;8.6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Purchase of Notes</i>.&nbsp; The Company will not and will not permit any
Affiliate to purchase, redeem, prepay or otherwise acquire, directly or
indirectly, any of the outstanding Notes except upon the payment or prepayment
of the Notes in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Notes.&nbsp; The Company will promptly cancel all Notes
acquired by it or any Affiliate pursuant to any payment, prepayment or purchase
of Notes pursuant to any provision of this Agreement and no Notes may be issued
in substitution or exchange for any such Notes.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Section&nbsp;8.7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Make-Whole Amount</i>.&nbsp; The term <i>&quot;Make-Whole
Amount&quot;</i> means, with respect to any Note, an amount equal to the excess, if
any, of the Discounted Value of the Remaining Scheduled Payments with respect
to the Called Principal of such Note over the amount of such Called Principal, <i>provided</i> that the Make-Whole Amount may
in no event be less than zero.&nbsp; For the
purposes of determining the Make-Whole Amount, the following terms have the
following meanings:</p>

<p><i>&quot;Called Principal&quot;</i>
means, with respect to any Note, the principal of such Note that is to be
prepaid pursuant to Section&nbsp;8.2 or has become or is declared to be
immediately due and payable pursuant to Section&nbsp;12.1, as the context
requires.</p>

<p><i>&quot;Discounted Value&quot;</i>
means, with respect to the Called Principal of any Note, the amount obtained by
discounting all Remaining Scheduled Payments with respect to such Called
Principal from their respective scheduled due dates to the Settlement Date with
respect to such Called Principal, in accordance with accepted financial
practice and at a discount factor (applied on the same periodic basis as that
on which interest on the Notes is payable) based on the Reinvestment Yield with
respect to such Called Principal.</p>

<p><i>&quot;Reinvestment
Yield&quot;</i> means, with respect to the Called Principal of any Note, the 0.50%
over the yield to maturity implied by (i)&nbsp;the yields reported, as of 10:00
A.M. (New York City time) on the second Business Day preceding the Settlement
Date with respect to such Called Principal, on the display designated as &quot;Page
678&quot; on the Telerate Access Service (or such other display as may replace Page
678 on the Telerate Access Service) for actively traded U.S. Treasury
securities having a maturity equal to the Remaining Average Life of such Called
Principal as of such Settlement Date, or (ii)&nbsp;if such yields are not
reported as of such time or the yields reported as of such time are not ascertainable,
the Treasury Constant Maturity Series Yields reported, for the latest day for
which such yields have been so reported as of the second Business Day preceding
the Settlement Date with respect to such Called Principal, in Federal Reserve
Statistical Release H.15 (519) (or any comparable successor publication) for
actively traded U.S. Treasury securities having a constant maturity equal to
the Remaining Average Life of such Called Principal as of such Settlement Date.&nbsp; Such implied yield will be determined, if
necessary, by (i)&nbsp;converting U.S. Treasury bill quotations to
bond-equivalent yields in accordance with accepted financial practice and
(ii)&nbsp;interpolating linearly between (A)&nbsp;the actively traded U.S.
Treasury security with the maturity closest to and greater than the Remaining
Average Life and (B)&nbsp;the actively traded U.S. Treasury security with the
maturity closest to and less than the Remaining Average Life.</p>

<p><i>&quot;Remaining Average
Life&quot;</i> means, with respect to any Called Principal, the number of years
(calculated to the nearest one-twelfth year) obtained by dividing (i)&nbsp;such
Called Principal into (ii)&nbsp;the sum of the products obtained by multiplying
(a)&nbsp;the principal component of each Remaining Scheduled Payment with
respect to such Called Principal by (b)&nbsp;the number of years (calculated to
the nearest one-twelfth year) that will elapse between the Settlement Date with
respect to such Called Principal and the scheduled due date of such Remaining
Scheduled Payment.</p>

<p><i>&quot;Remaining
Scheduled Payments&quot;</i> means, with respect to the Called Principal of any
Note, all payments of such Called Principal and interest thereon that would be
due after the Settlement Date with respect to such Called Principal if no
payment of such Called Principal were made prior to its scheduled due date, <i>provided</i> that if such Settlement Date is
not a date on which interest payments are due to be made under the terms of the
Notes, then the amount of the next succeeding scheduled interest payment will
be reduced by the amount of interest accrued to such Settlement Date and
required to be paid on such Settlement Date pursuant to Section&nbsp;8.2 or
12.1.</p>

<p><i>&quot;Settlement Date&quot;</i>
means, with respect to the Called Principal of any Note, the date on which such
Called Principal is to be prepaid pursuant to Section&nbsp;8.2 or has become or
is declared to be immediately due and payable pursuant to Section&nbsp;12.1, as
the context requires.</p>

<p>Section&nbsp;9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Affirmative Covenants.</p>

all Environmental Laws, and will obtain and maintain in effect all licenses,
certificates, permits, franchises and other governmental authorizations
necessary to the ownership of their respective properties or to the conduct of
their respective businesses, in each case to the extent necessary to ensure
that non-compliance with such laws, ordinances or governmental rules or
regulations or failures to obtain or maintain in effect such licenses,
certificates, permits, franchises and other governmental authorizations could
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.</p>

adequate reserves are maintained with respect thereto) as is customary in the

business and similarly situated.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Section&nbsp;9.3.&nbsp;&nbsp; Maintenance of Properties</i>.&nbsp; The Company will, and will cause each of its

therewith may be properly conducted at all times, <i>provided</i> that this Section shall not prevent the Company or any
Subsidiary from discontinuing the operation and the maintenance of any of its
properties if such discontinuance is desirable in the conduct of its business
and the Company has concluded that such discontinuance could not, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.</p>

such taxes and assessments have become due and payable and before they have
become delinquent and all claims for which sums have become due and payable
that have or might become a Lien on properties or assets of the Company or any
Subsidiary, <i>provided</i> that neither the
Company nor any Subsidiary need pay any such tax or assessment or claims if
(i)&nbsp;the amount, applicability or validity thereof is contested by the
Company or such Subsidiary on a timely basis in good faith and in appropriate
proceedings, and the Company or a Subsidiary has established adequate reserves
therefor in accordance with GAAP on the books of the Company or such Subsidiary
or (ii)&nbsp;the nonpayment of all such taxes, assessments and claims in the
aggregate could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Section&nbsp;9.5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corporate Existence, etc</i>.&nbsp; The Company will at all times preserve and
keep in full force and effect its corporate existence.&nbsp; Subject to Section&nbsp;10.8, the Company

Company and its Subsidiaries unless, in the good faith judgment of the Company,
the termination of or failure to preserve and keep in full force and effect the
corporate existence of any Subsidiary or any right or franchise could not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Section&nbsp;9.6.&nbsp;&nbsp; Notes to Rank Pari Passu</i>.&nbsp; The Notes of the Company are and shall at
all times rank at least <i>pari passu</i> as

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Section&nbsp;12.1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Acceleration</i>.&nbsp; (a)&nbsp;If an Event of Default with respect
to the Company described in paragraph (g) or (h) of Section&nbsp;11 (other than
an Event of Default described in clause (i) of paragraph (g) or described in
clause (vi) of paragraph (g) by virtue of the fact that such clause encompasses
clause (i) of paragraph (g)) has occurred, all the Notes then outstanding shall
automatically become immediately due and payable.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If any other Event of Default has occurred
and is continuing, any holder or holders of not less than 51% in principal

option, by notice or notices to the Company, declare all the Notes then
outstanding to be immediately due and payable.</p>

Amount determined in respect of such principal amount (to the full extent
permitted by applicable law), shall all be immediately due and payable, in each
and every case without presentment, demand, protest or further notice, all of
which are hereby waived.&nbsp; The Company
acknowledges, and the parties hereto agree, that each holder of a Note has the
right to maintain its investment in the Notes free from repayment by the
Company (except as herein specifically provided for), and that the provision for
payment of a Make-Whole Amount by the Company in the event that the Notes are
prepaid or are accelerated as a result of an Event of Default, is intended to
provide compensation for the deprivation of such right under such
circumstances.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Section&nbsp;12.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other Remedies</i>.&nbsp; If any Default or Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing, and irrespective of whether any Notes have become
or have been declared immediately due and payable under Section&nbsp;12.1, the
holder of any Note at the time outstanding may proceed to protect and enforce
the rights of such holder by an action at law, suit in equity or other
appropriate proceeding, whether for the specific performance of any agreement
contained herein or in any Note, or for an injunction against a violation of
any of the terms hereof or thereof, or in aid of the exercise of any power
granted hereby or thereby or by law or otherwise.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Section&nbsp;12.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rescission</i>.&nbsp; At any time after any Notes have been
declared due and payable pursuant to clause&nbsp;(b) or (c) of
Section&nbsp;12.1, the holders of not less than 51% in principal amount of the
Notes then outstanding, by written notice to the Company, may rescind and annul
any such declaration and its consequences if (a)&nbsp;the Company has paid all
overdue interest on the Notes of each series, all principal of and Make-Whole
Amount, if any, on any Notes that are due and payable and are unpaid other than
by reason of such declaration, and all interest on such overdue principal and
Make-Whole Amount, if any, and (to the extent permitted by applicable
law) any overdue interest in respect of the Notes of each series, at the
respective Default Rates, (b)&nbsp;all Events of Default and Defaults, other
than non-payment of amounts that have become due solely by reason of such
declaration, have been cured or have been waived pursuant to Section&nbsp;17,
and (c)&nbsp;no judgment or decree has been entered for the payment of any
monies due pursuant hereto or to the Notes.&nbsp;
No rescission and annulment under this Section&nbsp;12.3 will extend to
or affect any subsequent Event of Default or Default or impair any right
consequent thereon.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Section&nbsp;12.4.No Waivers or Election of Remedies, Expenses, etc</i>.&nbsp; No course of dealing and no delay on the
part of any holder of any Note in exercising any right, power or remedy shall
operate as a waiver thereof or otherwise prejudice such holder's rights, powers
or remedies.&nbsp; No right, power or remedy
conferred by this Agreement or by any Note upon any holder thereof shall be
exclusive of any other right, power or remedy referred to herein or therein or
now or hereafter available at law, in equity, by statute or otherwise.&nbsp; Without limiting the obligations of the
Company under Section&nbsp;15, the Company will pay to the holder of each Note
on demand such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover all costs and
expenses of such holder incurred in any enforcement or collection under this
Section&nbsp;12, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees,
expenses and disbursements.</p>

the unpaid principal amount of the surrendered Note.&nbsp; Each such new Note shall be payable to such Person as such holder
may request and shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit&nbsp;1-A, 1-B,

such Note be deemed to make the same representations to the Company regarding
the Note or participation as such holder made pursuant to Section&nbsp;6.2, <i>provided</i> that such entity may (in
reliance upon information provided by the Company, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld) make a representation to the effect that the purchase by such entity
of any Note will not constitute a non-exempt prohibited transaction under
section&nbsp;406(a) of ERISA.</p>

that if the holder of such Note is, or is a nominee for, an original Purchaser
or another holder of a Note with a minimum net worth of at least $100,000,000,
such Person's own unsecured agreement of indemnity shall be deemed to be
satisfactory), or</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b)&nbsp; in the case of mutilation, upon surrender and
cancellation thereof,</p>

<p>the Company at its own expense shall execute and deliver
within five Business Days of receipt of said evidence, in lieu thereof, a new
Note of the same series, dated and bearing interest from the date to which
interest shall have been paid on such lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated Note
or dated the date of such lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated Note if no
interest shall have been paid thereon.</p>

<p>Section&nbsp;14.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Payments on Notes.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Section&nbsp;14.1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Place of Payment</i>.&nbsp; Subject to Section&nbsp;14.2, payments of
principal, Make-Whole Amount, if any, and interest becoming due and
payable on the Notes shall be made in Bedminster, New Jersey at the principal
office of the Company in such jurisdiction.&nbsp;
The Company may at any time, by notice to each holder of a Note, change
the place of payment of the Notes so long as such place of payment shall be
either the principal office of the Company in such jurisdiction or the
principal office of a bank or trust company in such jurisdiction.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Section&nbsp;14.2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Home Office Payment</i>.&nbsp; So long as any Purchaser or any Purchaser's
nominee shall be the holder of any Note, and notwithstanding anything contained
in Section&nbsp;14.1 or in such Note to the contrary, the Company will pay all
sums becoming due on such Note for principal, Make-Whole Amount, if any, and
interest by the method and at the address specified for such purpose for such
Purchaser in Schedule&nbsp;A, or by such other method or at such other address
as such Purchaser shall have from time to time specified to the Company in
writing for such purpose, without the presentation or surrender of such Note or
the making of any notation thereon, except that upon written request of the
Company made concurrently with or reasonably promptly after payment or
prepayment in full of any Note, such Purchaser shall surrender such Note for
cancellation, reasonably promptly after any such request, to the Company at its
principal executive office or at the place of payment most recently designated
by the Company pursuant to Section&nbsp;14.1.&nbsp;
The Company will afford the benefits of this Section&nbsp;14.2 to any
Institutional Investor that is the direct or indirect transferee of any Note
purchased by any Purchaser under this Agreement and that has made the same
agreement relating to such Note as such Purchaser has made in this
Section&nbsp;14.2.</p>

<p>Section&nbsp;15.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Expenses, etc.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Section&nbsp;15.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Transaction Expenses</i>.&nbsp; Whether or not the transactions contemplated
hereby are consummated, the Company will pay all costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys' fees of a special counsel and, if reasonably required,
local or other counsel) incurred by each Purchaser or holder of a Note in
connection with such transactions and in connection with any amendments,
waivers or consents under or in respect of this Agreement or the Notes (whether
or not such amendment, waiver or consent becomes effective), including, without
limitation: (a)&nbsp;the costs and expenses incurred in enforcing or defending
(or determining whether or how to enforce or defend) any rights under this
Agreement or the Notes or in responding to any subpoena or other legal process
or informal investigative demand issued in connection with this Agreement or
the Notes, or by reason of being a holder of any Note, and (b)&nbsp;the costs
and expenses, including financial advisors' fees, incurred in connection with
the insolvency or bankruptcy of the Company or any Subsidiary or in connection
with any work-out or restructuring of the transactions contemplated hereby and
by the Notes.&nbsp; The Company will pay, and
will save each Purchaser and each other holder of a Note harmless from, all
claims in respect of any fees, costs or expenses, if any, of brokers and
finders (other than those retained by such Purchaser or holder).</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Section&nbsp;15.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Survival</i>.&nbsp; The obligations of the Company under this
Section&nbsp;15 will survive the payment or transfer of any Note, the
enforcement, amendment or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or the
Notes, and the termination of this Agreement.</p>

<p>Section&nbsp;16.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Survival of Representations and
Warranties; Entire Agreement.</p>

<p>All representations and warranties contained herein shall
survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Notes, the
purchase or transfer by any Purchaser of any Note or portion thereof or
interest therein and the payment of any Note, and may be relied upon by any
subsequent holder of a Note, regardless of any investigation made at any time
by or on behalf of such Purchaser or any other holder of a Note.&nbsp; All statements contained in any certificate
or other instrument delivered by or on behalf of the Company pursuant to this
Agreement shall be deemed representations and warranties of the Company under
this Agreement.&nbsp; Subject to the
preceding sentence, this Agreement and the Notes embody the entire agreement
and understanding between each Purchaser and the Company and supersede all
prior agreements and understandings relating to the subject matter hereof.</p>

<p>Section&nbsp;17.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Amendment and Waiver.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Section&nbsp;17.1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Requirements</i>.&nbsp; This Agreement and the Notes may be amended,
and the observance of any term hereof or of the Notes may be waived (either
retroactively or prospectively), with (and only with) the written consent of
the Company and the Required Holders, except that (a)&nbsp;no amendment or
waiver of any of the provisions of Section&nbsp;1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or 21 hereof,
or any defined term (as it is used therein), will be effective as to any
Purchaser unless consented to by such Purchaser in writing, and (b)&nbsp;no
such amendment or waiver may, without the written consent of the holder of each
Note at the time outstanding affected thereby, (i)&nbsp;subject to the
provisions of Section&nbsp;12 relating to acceleration or rescission, change
the amount or time of any prepayment or payment of principal of, or reduce the
rate or change the time of payment or method of computation of interest or of
the Make-Whole Amount on, the Notes, (ii)&nbsp;change the percentage of the
principal amount of the Notes the holders of which are required to consent to
any such amendment or waiver, or (iii)&nbsp;amend any of Sections&nbsp;8,
11(a), 11(b), 12, 17 or 20.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Section&nbsp;17.2.Solicitation of Holders of Notes</i>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a)&nbsp; <i>Solicitation</i>.&nbsp; The Company will provide each holder of the
Notes (irrespective of the amount of Notes then owned by it) with sufficient
information, sufficiently far in advance of the date a decision is required, to
enable such holder to make an informed and considered decision with respect to
any proposed amendment, waiver or consent in respect of any of the provisions
hereof or of the Notes.&nbsp; The Company
will deliver executed or true and correct copies of each amendment, waiver or
consent effected pursuant to the provisions of this Section&nbsp;17 to each
holder of outstanding Notes promptly following the date on which it is executed
and delivered by, or receives the consent or approval of, the requisite holders
of Notes.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b)&nbsp; <i>Payment</i>.&nbsp; The Company will not directly or indirectly
pay or cause to be paid any remuneration, whether by way of supplemental or
additional interest, fee or otherwise, or grant any security, to any holder of
Notes as consideration for or as an inducement to the entering into by any
holder of Notes of any waiver or amendment of any of the terms and provisions
hereof or of the Notes unless such remuneration is concurrently paid, or
security is concurrently granted, on the same terms, ratably to each holder of
Notes then outstanding whether or not such holder consented to such waiver or
amendment.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Section&nbsp;17.3.&nbsp;&nbsp; Binding Effect, etc</i>.&nbsp; Any amendment or waiver consented to as
provided in this Section&nbsp;17 applies equally to all holders of Notes and is
binding upon them and upon each future holder of any Note and upon the Company
without regard to whether such Note has been marked to indicate such amendment
or waiver.&nbsp; No such amendment or waiver
will extend to or affect any obligation, covenant, agreement, Default or Event
of Default not expressly amended or waived or impair any right consequent
thereon.&nbsp; No course of dealing between
the Company and the holder of any Note nor any delay in exercising any rights
hereunder or under any Note shall operate as a waiver of any rights of any
holder of such Note.&nbsp; As used herein,
the term &quot;this Agreement&quot; and references thereto shall mean this Agreement as
it may from time to time be amended or supplemented.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Section&nbsp;17.4.&nbsp;&nbsp; Notes Held by Company, etc</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Solely for the purpose of determining
whether the holders of the requisite percentage of the aggregate principal
amount of Notes then outstanding approved or consented to any amendment, waiver
or consent to be given under this Agreement or the Notes, or have directed the
taking of any action provided herein or in the Notes to be taken upon the
direction of the holders of a specified percentage of the aggregate principal amount
of Notes then outstanding, Notes directly or indirectly owned by the Company or
any of its Affiliates shall be deemed not to be outstanding.</p>

<p>Section&nbsp;18.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notices.</p>

<p>All notices and communications provided for hereunder shall
be in writing and sent (a)&nbsp;by telefacsimile if the sender on the same day
sends a confirming copy of such notice by a recognized overnight delivery
service (charges prepaid), or (b)&nbsp;by registered or certified mail with
return receipt requested (postage prepaid), or (c)&nbsp;by a recognized
overnight delivery service (with charges prepaid).&nbsp; Any such notice must be sent:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i)&nbsp; if to a Purchaser or such Purchaser's nominee,
to such Purchaser or such Purchaser's nominee at the address specified for such
communications in Schedule&nbsp;A, or at such other address as such Purchaser
or such Purchaser's nominee shall have specified to the Company in writing,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii)&nbsp; if to any other holder of any Note, to such
holder at such address as such other holder shall have specified to the Company
in writing, or</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iii)&nbsp; if to the Company, to the Company at its
address set forth at the beginning hereof to the attention of the Treasurer, or
at such other address as the Company shall have specified to the holder of each
Note in writing.</p>

<p>Notices under this Section&nbsp;18 will be deemed given only
when actually received.</p>

<p>Section&nbsp;19.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reproduction of Documents.</p>

<p>This Agreement and all documents relating thereto,
including, without limitation, (a)&nbsp;consents, waivers and modifications
that may hereafter be executed, (b)&nbsp;documents received by each Purchaser
at the Closing (except the Notes themselves), and (c)&nbsp;financial
statements, certificates and other information previously or hereafter furnished
to each Purchaser, may be reproduced by such Purchaser by any photographic,
photostatic, microfilm, microcard, miniature photographic or other similar
process and such Purchaser may destroy any original document so reproduced.&nbsp; The Company agrees and stipulates that, to
the extent permitted by applicable law, any such reproduction shall be
admissible in evidence as the original itself in any judicial or administrative
proceeding (whether or not the original is in existence and whether or not such
reproduction was made by such Purchaser in the regular course of business) and
any enlargement, facsimile or further reproduction of such reproduction shall
likewise be admissible in evidence.&nbsp;
This Section&nbsp;19 shall not prohibit the Company or any other holder
of Notes from contesting any such reproduction to the same extent that it could
contest the original, or from introducing evidence to demonstrate the
inaccuracy of any such reproduction.</p>

<p>Section&nbsp;20.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Confidential Information</p>

<p>For the purposes of this Section&nbsp;20, <i>&quot;Confidential Information&quot;</i> means
information delivered to any holder of any Note by or on behalf of the Company
or any Subsidiary in connection with the transactions contemplated by or
otherwise pursuant to this Agreement that is proprietary in nature and that was
clearly marked or labeled or otherwise adequately identified when received by
such holder as being confidential information of the Company or such
Subsidiary, <i>provided</i> that such term
does not include information that (a)&nbsp;was publicly known or otherwise
known to such holder prior to the time of such disclosure,
(b)&nbsp;subsequently becomes publicly known through no act or omission by such
holder or any Person acting on such holder's behalf, (c)&nbsp;otherwise becomes
known to such holder other than through disclosure by the Company, any
Subsidiary or another holder of a Note, (d)&nbsp;constitutes financial
statements delivered to such holder under Section&nbsp;7.1 that are otherwise
publicly available or (e)&nbsp;independently developed by such holder or its
Affiliates or professional advisors without the use of Confidential
Information.&nbsp; Each holder of a Note will
maintain the confidentiality of such Confidential Information in accordance
with procedures adopted by such holder in good faith to protect confidential
information of third parties delivered to such holder, <i>provided</i> that such holder may deliver or disclose Confidential
Information to (i)&nbsp;such holder's directors, trustees, officers, employees,
agents, attorneys and affiliates (to the extent such disclosure reasonably
relates to the administration of the investment represented by such holder's
Notes and is in compliance with such procedures), (ii)&nbsp;such holder's
financial advisors and other professional advisors who agree to hold
confidential the Confidential Information substantially in accordance with the
terms of this Section&nbsp;20, (iii)&nbsp;any other holder of any Note,
(iv)&nbsp;any Institutional Investor to which such holder sells or offers to
sell such Note or any part thereof or any participation therein (if such Person
has agreed in writing prior to its receipt of such Confidential Information to
be bound by the provisions of this Section&nbsp;20), (v)&nbsp;any Person from
which such holder offers to purchase any security of the Company (if such
Person has agreed in writing prior to its receipt of such Confidential
Information to be bound by the provisions of this Section&nbsp;20),
(vi)&nbsp;any federal or state regulatory authority having jurisdiction over
such holder, (vii)&nbsp;the National Association of Insurance Commissioners or
any similar organization, or any nationally recognized rating agency that
requires access to information about such holder's investment portfolio, or
(viii)&nbsp;any other Person to which such delivery or disclosure may be necessary
or appropriate (w)&nbsp;to effect compliance with any law, rule, regulation or
order applicable to such holder, (x)&nbsp;in response to any subpoena or other
legal process, (y)&nbsp;in connection with any litigation to which such holder
is a party or (z)&nbsp;if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing,
to the extent such holder may reasonably determine such delivery and disclosure
to be necessary or appropriate in the enforcement or for the protection of the
rights and remedies under such holder's Notes or this Agreement.&nbsp; Each holder of a Note, by its acceptance of
a Note, will be deemed to have agreed to be bound by and to be entitled to the
benefits of this Section&nbsp;20 as though it were a party to this Agreement.&nbsp; On reasonable request by the Company in connection
with the delivery to any holder of a Note of information required to be
delivered to such holder under this Agreement or requested by such holder
(other than a holder that is a party to this Agreement or its nominee or any
other holder that shall have previously delivered such a confirmation), such
holder will confirm in writing that it is bound by the provisions of this
Section&nbsp;20.</p>

<p>Section&nbsp;21.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Substitution of Purchaser.</p>

<p>Each Purchaser shall have the right to substitute any one
of its Affiliates as the purchaser of the Notes that such Purchaser has agreed
to purchase hereunder, by written notice to the Company, which notice shall be
signed by both such Purchaser and such Affiliate, shall contain such
Affiliate's agreement to be bound by this Agreement and shall contain a
confirmation by such Affiliate of the accuracy with respect to it of the
representations set forth in Section&nbsp;6.&nbsp;
Upon receipt of such notice, wherever the word &quot;Purchaser&quot; is used in
this Agreement (other than in this Section&nbsp;21), such word shall be deemed
to refer to such Affiliate in lieu of such Purchaser.&nbsp; In the event that such Affiliate is so substituted as a purchaser
hereunder and such Affiliate thereafter transfers to such Purchaser all of the
Notes then held by such Affiliate, upon receipt by the Company of notice of
such transfer, wherever the word &quot;Purchaser&quot; is used in this Agreement (other
than in this Section&nbsp;21), such word shall no longer be deemed to refer to
such Affiliate, but shall refer to such Purchaser, and such Purchaser shall
have all the rights of an original holder of the Notes under this Agreement.</p>

<p>Section&nbsp;22.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Miscellaneous.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Section&nbsp;22.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Successors and Assigns</i>.&nbsp; All covenants and other agreements contained
in this Agreement by or on behalf of any of the parties hereto bind and inure
to the benefit of their respective successors and assigns (including, without
limitation, any subsequent holder of a Note) whether so expressed or not.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Section&nbsp;22.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Payments Due on Non-Business Days</i><a
name="_Toc522949143"></a>.&nbsp; Anything in this Agreement or the Notes to
the contrary notwithstanding, any payment of principal of or Make-Whole Amount
or interest on any Note that is due on a date other than a Business Day shall
be made on the next succeeding Business Day without including the additional
days elapsed in the computation of the interest payable on such next succeeding
Business Day.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Section&nbsp;22.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Severability</i>.&nbsp; Any provision of this Agreement that is
prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction,
be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without
invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or
unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall (to the full extent permitted by
law) not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other
jurisdiction.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Section&nbsp;22.4.&nbsp; Construction</i>.&nbsp; Each covenant contained herein shall be
construed (absent express provision to the contrary) as being independent of
each other covenant contained herein, so that compliance with any one covenant
shall not (absent such an express contrary provision) be deemed to excuse
compliance with any other covenant.&nbsp;
Where any provision herein refers to action to be taken by any Person,
or which such Person is prohibited from taking, such provision shall be
applicable whether such action is taken directly or indirectly by such Person.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Section&nbsp;22.5.&nbsp;&nbsp; Counterparts</i>.&nbsp; This Agreement may be executed in any number
of counterparts, each of which shall be an original but all of which together
shall constitute one instrument.&nbsp; Each
counterpart may consist of a number of copies hereof, each signed by fewer than
all, but together signed by all, of the parties hereto.</p>

<p>&nbsp; <i>Section&nbsp;22.6.&nbsp;&nbsp; Governing Law</i>.&nbsp; This Agreement shall be
construed and enforced in accordance with, and the rights of the parties shall
be governed by, the law of the State of New York excluding choice-of-law
principles of the law of such State that would require the application of the
laws of a jurisdiction other than such State.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Section&nbsp;22.7.&nbsp;&nbsp; Consent to Jurisdiction and Service of Process</i>.&nbsp; (a) To the extent permitted by applicable
law, the Company (i) hereby irrevocably submits to the nonexclusive
jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County
(without prejudice to the rights of any holder of a Note to remove to the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York) and to the
nonexclusive jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York, for the purposes of any suit, action or other proceeding
arising out of this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby brought by any holder of the Notes,
(ii) hereby irrevocably agrees that all claims in respect of such action or
proceeding may be heard and determined in such New York State court or, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law, in such federal court, and (iii)
hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a
defense, or otherwise, in any such suit, action or proceeding any claim that is
not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts, that the
suit, action or proceeding is improper or that this Agreement, or the subject
matter hereof may not be enforced in or by such court.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A final judgment obtained in respect of any
action, suit or proceeding referred to in this Section 22.7 shall be conclusive
and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit or judgment or in any manner
as provided by applicable law.&nbsp; The
Company hereby consents to service of process by registered mail, Federal
Express, or similar courier at its address set forth in Section 18, it being
agreed that service in such manner shall constitute valid service upon or its
respective successors or assigns in connection with any such action or
proceeding only; <i>provided, however,</i>
that nothing in this Section 22.7 shall affect the right of any holder of the
Notes to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by applicable law.</p>
