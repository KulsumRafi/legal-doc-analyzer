(i)  $7,426,406.22  of the  Existing  Loans will be amended and restated as
outstanding  Revolving  Loans  (hereinafter  defined) under this Agreement,
(ii) the aggregate  principal  amount of the Existing  Loans of each Lender
that is not  amended  and  restated  as a  Revolving  Loan  pursuant to the
preceding  clause (i) will be amended  and  restated as a term loan of such
Lender under this  Agreement  (each such term loan, a "Term  Loan"),  (iii)
each  Existing  Letter of Credit will be deemed to have been  issued  under
this  Agreement  and will be  subject  to all of the terms  and  conditions
applicable to Letters of Credit  hereunder,  and (iv) the Existing  Default
will be deemed waived by the Lenders.

     2.2  Amended  and  Restated   Revolving  Loan  and  Letter  of  Credit
Commitments.  On and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
each of the Lenders,  severally and for itself alone,  agrees to make loans
to, and to issue or  participate  in the  issuance of Letters of Credit for
the joint and several account of, the Borrowers as follows:

     (A) Amended and Restated Revolving Loan Commitment. From and after the
Closing Date, each Lender will make loans on a revolving basis  ("Revolving
Loans")  from time to time  before the  Revolver  Termination  Date in such
Lender's  Percentage of such  aggregate  amounts as the Borrowers may, from
time to time,  request  from  all  Lenders;  provided  that,  the  Revolver
Outstandings  will not at any  time  exceed  the  lesser  of (i)  Revolving
Commitment  Availability  and  (ii) the  Borrowing  Base.  As set  forth in
Section  2.1,  on the  Closing  Date,  an  aggregate  principal  amount  of
$7,426,406.22 of Revolving Loans will be outstanding.

     (B) Amended and  Restated  Letter of Credit  Commitment.  (i) From and
after the Closing  Date the Issuing Bank will issue  letters of credit,  in
each case  containing  such terms and  conditions  as are permitted by this
Agreement  and are  reasonably  satisfactory  to the  Issuing  Bank (each a
"Letter  of  Credit"),  at the  request  of and for the joint  and  several
account of the Borrowers from time to time before the Revolver  Termination
Date and (ii) as more fully set forth in Section 2.4(B), each Lender agrees
to purchase a participation  in each such Letter of Credit;  provided that,
the aggregate  Stated Amount of all Letters of Credit shall not at any time
exceed  $1,500,000.  As set forth in Section  2.1, on the Closing Date each
Existing  Letter  of  Credit  will  be  deemed  to  have  been  issued  and
outstanding under this Agreement.

     2.3  Revolving Loan Procedures.
          -------------------------

     (A) Making of Revolving Loans. The Parent, on behalf of the Borrowers,
shall give written  notice or telephonic  notice  (followed  immediately by
written confirmation  thereof) to the Administrative Agent of each proposed
Revolving  Loan not later than 11:00 A.M.  (Chicago,  Illinois time) on the
proposed date of such Revolving  Loan.  Each such notice shall be effective
upon receipt by the  Administrative  Agent,  shall be irrevocable and shall
specify the date and amount of the  Revolving  Loan.  Each  Revolving  Loan
shall be in an  aggregate  principal  amount  of at least  $100,000  and an
integral  multiple of $50,000.  Promptly  upon receipt of such notice,  the
Administrative  Agent shall advise each Lender thereof. Not later than 1:00
P.M.  (Chicago,  Illinois time) on the date of a proposed  Revolving  Loan,
each Lender shall provide the Administrative  Agent at the office specified
by the Administrative Agent with immediately  available funds covering such
Lender's   Percentage  of  such   Revolving   Loan  and,  so  long  as  the
Administrative  Agent has not received  written  notice that the conditions
precedent set forth in Section 11 with respect to such  Revolving Loan have
not been satisfied,  upon receipt of such funds, the  Administrative  Agent
shall  disburse  such  funds  in the  manner  specified  in the  notice  of
borrowing  delivered by the Parent and shall use reasonable efforts to make
the funds so received from the Lenders  available to the Borrowers no later
than 2:00 P.M.  (Chicago,  Illinois time). All borrowings and repayments of
Revolving  Loans shall be effected so that each Lender will have a pro rata
share (according to its Percentage) of all Revolving Loans.

     (B) Funding Reliance.  Unless the Administrative Agent receives notice
from a Lender by noon  (Chicago,  Illinois time) on the day of the proposed
borrowing  that such Lender will not make  available to the  Administrative
Agent an amount equal to such Lender's  Percentage of such  borrowing,  the
Administrative  Agent may  assume  that such  Lender  has made such  amount
available  to  the   Administrative   Agent  and,  in  reliance  upon  such
assumption,  make a corresponding amount available to the Borrowers. If and
to the  extent  such  Lender  has not made  such  amount  available  to the
Administrative  Agent,  such Lender and the Borrowers jointly and severally
agree to repay such amount to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand,
together  with interest  thereon at the interest  rate  applicable to Loans
comprising  such  borrowing  or, in the case of any Lender that repays such
amount within three  Business  Days,  the Federal Funds Rate (together with
such  other  compensatory  amounts  as may be  required  to be paid by such
Lender to the  Administrative  Agent  pursuant  to the Rules for  Interbank
Compensation of the Council on International  Banking or the  Clearinghouse
Compensation  Committee,  as  applicable,  as in effect from time to time).
Nothing  set forth in this  clause  (C)  shall  relieve  any  Lender of any
obligation it may have to make any Loan hereunder.

     2.4  Letter of Credit Procedures.
          ---------------------------

     (A)  Letter  of  Credit  Applications.  The  Parent,  on behalf of the
Borrowers,  shall give notice to the  Administrative  Agent and the Issuing
Bank of the  proposed  issuance of each Letter of Credit on a Business  Day
that is at least three  Business Days (or such lesser number of days as the
Administrative  Agent and the Issuing  Bank shall  agree in any  particular
instance)  prior to the proposed date of issuance of such Letter of Credit.
Each such notice shall be  accompanied  by a Letter of Credit  Application,
completed and duly executed by the Parent on behalf of the Borrowers and in
all respects  reasonably  satisfactory to the Administrative  Agent and the
Issuing Bank,  together with such other documentation as the Administrative
Agent  or the  Issuing  Bank  may  request  in  support  thereof,  it being
understood  that each Letter of Credit  Application  shall  specify,  among
other  things,  the date on which  the  proposed  Letter of Credit is to be
issued,  the  expiration  date of such Letter of Credit (which shall not be
later than  December  30,  2003) and whether such Letter of Credit is to be
transferable  in  whole  or in part.  So long as the  Issuing  Bank has not
received written notice that the conditions  precedent set forth in Section
11 with  respect to the  issuance  of such  Letter of Credit  have not been
satisfied,  the  Issuing  Bank  shall  issue  such  Letter of Credit on the
requested  issuance  date.  The  Issuing  Bank  shall  promptly  advise the
Administrative  Agent of the  issuance  of each Letter of Credit and of any
amendment thereto,  extension thereof or event or circumstance changing the
amount available for drawing thereunder.  In the event of any inconsistency
between the terms of any Letter of Credit Application and the terms of this
Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall control.

     (B) Participation in Letters of Credit. Concurrently with the issuance
of each Letter of Credit, the Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have sold and
transferred  to each other  Lender,  and each other  Lender shall be deemed
irrevocably  and  unconditionally  to have  purchased and received from the
Issuing  Bank,  without  recourse or warranty,  an  undivided  interest and
participation,  to the extent of such other  Lender's  Percentage,  in such
Letter of Credit and the Borrowers' reimbursement  obligations with respect
thereto. For the purposes of this Agreement,  the unparticipated portion of
each  Letter  of  Credit   shall  be  deemed  to  be  the  Issuing   Bank's
"participation"  therein.  The Issuing  Bank  agrees,  upon  request of the
Administrative Agent or any Lender, to deliver to such Lender a list of all
outstanding  Letters of Credit  issued by the Issuing  Bank,  together with
such information related thereto as such Lender may reasonably request.

     (C) Reimbursement  Obligations.  The Borrowers hereby  unconditionally
and  irrevocably  agree to  reimburse  the Issuing Bank for each payment or
disbursement  made by the Issuing Bank under any Letter of Credit  honoring
any demand for payment made by the beneficiary thereunder,  in each case on
the date that such payment or disbursement is made, so long as such payment
or  disbursement  is made in the  absence of gross  negligence  and willful
misconduct on behalf of the Issuing Bank;  provided that, if the Parent, on
behalf of the Borrowers, shall have given the Administrative Agent a notice
of borrowing in  accordance  with Section  2.2(B) not later than 11:00 A.M.
(Chicago,  Illinois  time)  on  the  Business  Day  of  the  date  of  such
disbursement  indicating that the Borrowers intend to reimburse the Issuing
Bank for the amount of such drawing  with the proceeds of Revolving  Loans,
then, so long as the  Administrative  Agent has not received written notice
that the conditions  precedent set forth in Section 11 with respect to such
Revolving  Loan have not been  satisfied,  the  Administrative  Agent shall
advise each  Lender  thereof  and the  Lenders  shall,  on the date of such
disbursement,  make Revolving  Loans that are Base Rate Loans in the amount
requested by the Parent, proceeds of which in an amount equal to the amount
of such disbursement shall be applied directly by the Administrative  Agent
to reimburse the Issuing Bank for the amount of such disbursement; provided
further,  that  if for any  reason  proceeds  of  Revolving  Loans  are not
received by the Issuing  Bank on such date in an amount equal to the amount
of such  disbursement,  the Borrowers  shall reimburse the Issuing Bank, on
the Business Day immediately  following the date of such disbursement in an
amount in same day funds equal to the excess of the amount of such  drawing
over the amount of such  Revolving  Loans,  if any,  that the Issuing  Bank
previously received,  plus accrued interest on such amount at the rate then
applicable  to Base  Rate  Loans.  The  Issuing  Bank  will  refund  to the
Borrowers any payment or disbursement  erroneously made by the Issuing Bank
promptly after the Issuing Bank recovers such payment or disbursement.  Any
amount not  reimbursed  on the date of such payment or  disbursement  shall
bear  interest  from the date of such payment or  disbursement  to the date
that the Issuing Bank is reimbursed by the Borrowers  therefor,  payable on
demand,  at a rate per  annum  equal to the Base  Rate from time to time in
effect plus 3.00% plus,  beginning on the third  Business Day after receipt
of notice from the Issuing Bank of such payment or disbursement, 2.00%. The
Issuing  Bank  shall  notify the  Borrowers  and the  Administrative  Agent
whenever  any demand for  payment is made under any Letter of Credit by the
beneficiary  thereunder;  provided that, the failure of the Issuing Bank so
to notify the Borrowers  shall not affect the rights of the Issuing Bank or
the Lenders in any manner whatsoever.

     (D) Limitation on Obligations of Issuing Bank. In determining  whether
to pay  under  any  Letter  of  Credit,  the  Issuing  Bank  shall  have no
obligation  to the  Borrowers  or any Lender other than to confirm that any
documents  required to be delivered  under such Letter of Credit  appear to
have  been   delivered  and  appear  to  comply  on  their  face  with  the
requirements  of such Letter of Credit.  Any action  taken or omitted to be
taken by the Issuing Bank under or in connection with any Letter of Credit,
if  taken  or  omitted  in the  absence  of gross  negligence  and  willful
misconduct,  shall not impose upon the Issuing  Bank any  liability  to the
Borrowers  or any  Lender  and shall not  reduce or impair  the  Borrowers'
reimbursement obligations set forth in Section 2.3(C) or the obligations of
the Lenders pursuant to Section 2.3(E).

     (E) Funding by Lenders to Issuing  Bank. If the Issuing Bank makes any
payment or  disbursement  under any Letter of Credit and the Borrowers have
not reimbursed the Issuing Bank in full for such payment or disbursement by
11:00  A.M.  (Chicago,  Illinois  time)  on the  date  of such  payment  or
disbursement, or if any reimbursement received by the Issuing Bank from the
Borrowers  must be returned or rescinded  upon or during any  bankruptcy or
reorganization  of the Borrowers or  otherwise,  each other Lender shall be
obligated to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing
Bank, in full or partial payment of the purchase price of its participation
in such Letter of Credit,  its pro rata share (according to its Percentage)
of such payment or  disbursement  (but no such payment  shall  diminish the
obligations  of the Borrowers  under Section  2.3(C)) and, upon notice from
the Issuing Bank, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each other
Lender thereof. Each other Lender irrevocably and unconditionally agrees so
to pay to the Administrative  Agent in immediately  available funds for the
Issuing Bank's account the amount of such other Lender's Percentage of such
payment or  disbursement.  If and to the  extent any Lender  shall not have
made  such  amount  available  to the  Administrative  Agent  by 2:00  P.M.
(Chicago,  Illinois time) on the Business Day on which such Lender receives
notice from the  Administrative  Agent of such payment or disbursement  (it
being  understood  that any  such  notice  received  after  noon  (Chicago,
Illinois time) on any Business Day shall be deemed to have been received on
the next  following  Business  Day),  such Lender agrees to pay interest on
such  amount to the  Administrative  Agent for the Issuing  Bank's  account
forthwith on demand for each day from the date such amount was to have been
delivered to the Administrative Agent to the date such amount is paid, at a
rate per annum  equal to (i) for the first  three  days after  demand,  the
Federal  Funds  Rate from time to time in effect and (ii)  thereafter,  the
Base  Rate  from  time to time in  effect.  Any  Lender's  failure  to make
available to the Administrative Agent its Percentage of any such payment or
disbursement shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligation hereunder
to  make  available  to  the  Administrative   Agent  such  other  Lender's
Percentage  of such  payment,  but no Lender shall be  responsible  for the
failure of any other Lender to make available to the  Administrative  Agent
such other Lender's Percentage of any such payment or disbursement.

     (F) Cash  Collateral.  When the Borrowers are required to provide cash
collateral  for any  Letter of Credit  under  this  Agreement  prior to the
Revolver  Termination  Date, the Borrowers  will pay to the  Administrative
Agent for the benefit of the Issuing Bank and the Lenders cash in an amount
equal to 105% of the  Stated  Amount  of each  applicable  Letter of Credit
outstanding  for the benefit of the Borrowers.  Such funds shall be held by
the Administrative Agent in a cash collateral account (the "Cash Collateral
Account")  maintained  at the  Administrative  Agent.  The Cash  Collateral
Account shall be in the name of the Borrowers, and shall be pledged to, and
subject to the control of, the Administrative  Agent for the benefit of the
Issuing Bank in a manner  satisfactory  to the  Administrative  Agent.  The
Borrowers pledge and grant to the  Administrative  Agent for the benefit of
the Issuing Bank and the Lenders a security interest in all such funds held
in the Cash Collateral  Account from time to time and all proceeds thereof,
as security for the payment of all amounts due in respect of the Letters of
Credit,  whether or not then due.  This  Agreement  constitutes  a security
agreement  under  applicable  law. If any Letter of Credit,  whether or not
then due and payable,  shall for any reason be  outstanding on the Revolver
Termination  Date, the Borrowers  shall either (i) provide cash  collateral
therefor  in the manner  described  above,  (ii) cause all such  Letters of
Credit to be canceled and  returned or (iii)  deliver a letter (or letters)
of credit in guarantee of such Letter of Credit,  which letter (or letters)
of credit shall be of like tenor and duration as, and in an amount equal to
105% of, the Stated Amount of the Letters of Credit to which it relates and
shall be  issued  by a  Person,  and  shall be  subject  to such  terms and
conditions  as are  satisfactory  to the  Administrative  Agent in its sole
discretion.  At any time  after an Event of  Default  has  occurred  and is
continuing,  the Administrative Agent may apply funds then held in the Cash
Collateral  Account to the  payment of any  amounts  due and payable by the
Borrowers  to the Issuing  Bank and the Lenders with respect to the Letters
of Credit of the Borrowers or the Revolver  Outstandings  relating  thereto
and,  upon  satisfaction  in full of all  such  Letters  of  Credit  of the
Borrowers,  to any other  Obligations and liabilities of the Borrowers then
due and  payable  to the  Administrative  Agent or the  Lenders  under this
Agreement or the other Loan Documents. Neither the Borrowers nor any Person
claiming  on behalf of or  through  the  Borrowers  shall have any right to
withdraw any of the funds held in the Cash Collateral Account,  except that
upon  the  termination  of  all  Letters  of  Credit,  the  payment  of all
obligations and liabilities  with respect to such Letters of Credit and, if
an  Event  of  Default  has  occurred  and is  continuing  or the  Revolver
Termination  Date  has  occurred,   the  payment  of  all  obligations  and
liabilities  payable by the  Borrowers  to the Agents or the Lenders  under
this Agreement, any funds remaining in the Cash Collateral Account shall be
paid to the Borrowers or as otherwise required by law.

     2.5 Commitments Several. The failure of any Lender to make a requested
Loan on any date shall not relieve any other Lender of its  obligation  (if
any) to make a Loan on such date,  but no Lender shall be  responsible  for
the  failure of any other  Lender to make any Loan to be made by such other
Lender.

     2.6 Certain  Conditions.  Notwithstanding  any other provision of this
Agreement,  no Lender shall have an  obligation  to make any Loan,  and the
Issuing Bank shall not have any  obligation  to issue any Letter of Credit,
if a Default or Event of Default exists.

          SECTION 3. NOTES EVIDENCING LOANS; REPAYMENT OF LOANS.
                     ------------------------------------------

     3.1 Notes.  The Loans of each Lender,  as amended and  restated  under
this  Agreement,  shall be evidenced by an amended and restated  promissory
note (each, a "Note")  substantially  in the form set forth in Exhibits A-1
and A-2, with appropriate  insertions,  payable to the order of such Lender
in a face principal amount equal to the sum of such Lender's  Percentage of
the Revolving  Commitment Amount plus the principal amount of such Lender's
Term Loan. Each Note shall be payable to the order of the applicable Lender
in an amount equal to the aggregate  unpaid principal amount of all of such
Lender's Loans, as follows:

     (A) each  Revolving Loan of such Lender shall be repaid in full on the
Revolver Termination Date; and

     (B) each Term Loan of such Lender  shall be repaid in full on June 30,
2003.

     3.2  Return of  Existing  Notes.  Upon the  Borrowers'  execution  and
delivery of the Notes to each  Lender,  each Lender will return each of its
Existing Notes to the Borrowers marked "superceded."

     3.3 Recordkeeping.  Each Lender shall record in its records, or at its
option on the  schedule  attached to its Note,  the date and amount of each
Loan made by such Lender and each repayment  thereof.  The aggregate unpaid
principal  amount so recorded shall be rebuttable  presumptive  evidence of
the  principal  amount  owing and  unpaid on such Note.  The  failure so to
record any such amount or any error in so  recording  any such amount shall
not,  however,  limit or otherwise  affect the Obligations of the Borrowers
hereunder  or under  any Note to repay  the  principal  amount of the Loans
evidenced by such Note together with all interest accruing thereon.

                           SECTION 4. INTEREST.
                                      --------

     4.1 Interest Rates.  (A) The Borrowers  promise to pay interest on the
unpaid principal amount of each Loan for the period  commencing on the date
of such  Loan  until  such  Loan is paid in full at all times at a rate per
annum  equal to the sum of the Base Rate  from time to time in effect  plus
3.00%.

     (B) At any  time  an  Event  of  Default  exists,  the  interest  rate
applicable  to each Loan shall be  increased by 2.00% in excess of the rate
otherwise in effect and will be payable on demand.

     4.2 Interest  Payment  Dates.  Accrued  interest on each Loan shall be
payable in arrears on the last Business Day of each  calendar  month and at
maturity. After maturity, accrued interest on all Loans shall be payable on
demand.

     4.3  Computation of Interest.  All  computations  of interest shall be
computed  for the actual  number of days  elapsed on the basis of a year of
360  days.  The  applicable  interest  rate  for  each  Loan  shall  change
simultaneously with each change in the Base Rate.

                             SECTION 5. FEES.
                                        ----

     5.1  Commitment  Fees.  The  Borrowers  agree  to pay to each  Lender,
through the Administrative  Agent, on the last day of each calendar quarter
commencing  with the first such day after the date  hereof (or, if any such
date shall not be a Business Day, the next succeeding Business Day), and on
the date on which the last  Commitments  of such Lender  shall expire or be
terminated  as provided  herein  (each such day being called a "Fee Payment
Date"), a commitment fee (a "Commitment Fee") equal to 3.00% on the average
daily unused amount of the  Commitments of such Lender  (including  without
limitation  such  Lender's  Commitment  to  make a Term  Loan)  during  the
preceding  quarter  (or other  period  commencing  with the date  hereof or
ending  with the date on which the last of the  Commitments  of such Lender
shall expire or be  terminated).  All Commitment Fees shall be computed for
the actual  number of days elapsed on the basis of a year of 360 days.

     5.2  Letter  of Credit  Fees.  (A) The  Borrowers  agree to pay to the
Administrative  Agent for the account of the Lenders, pro rata according to
their  respective  Percentages,  a letter of credit fee for each  Letter of
Credit in an amount  equal to a rate per annum equal to 3.00% with  respect
to  Letters of Credit in effect  from time to time of the Stated  Amount of
such  Letter of Credit (in each case as computed  for the actual  number of
days elapsed on the basis of a year of 360 days);  provided  that, the rate
applicable to each Letter of Credit shall be increased by 2.00% at any time
that an Event of Default exists. Such letter of credit fee shall be payable
in arrears on the last  Business  Day of each  calendar  quarter and on the
Revolver  Termination  Date for the period from the date of the issuance of
each Letter of Credit to the date such  payment is due or, if earlier,  the
date on which such Letter of Credit expired or was terminated.

     (B) In addition to the fees set forth in Section 5.2(A),  with respect
to each Letter of Credit,  the Borrowers  agree to pay to the Issuing Bank,
for its own  account,  (i)  such  fees and  expenses  as the  Issuing  Bank
customarily   requires  in  connection  with  the  issuance,   negotiation,
processing or administration of letters of credit in similar situations and
(ii) a letter of credit fronting fee of 0.125% of the Stated Amount of each
Letter of Credit upon issuance thereof.

     5.3 Amendment and  Restatement  Fees. The Borrowers will pay a fee for
amending and restating this Agreement to the  Administrative  Agent for the
account of each Lender in an amount equal to $250,000 on or before June 30,
2003.

                   SECTION 6. REDUCTION AND TERMINATION
                      OF THE COMMITMENTS; PREPAYMENTS.
                      -------------------------------

     6.1  Reduction or Termination of the Revolving Commitment Amount.
          -----------------------------------------------------------

     (A) Voluntary  Reduction or  Termination  of the Revolving  Commitment
Amount.  Upon at least five  Business  Days'  prior  written  notice to the
Administrative  Agent,  the Borrowers may at any time in whole  permanently
terminate,  or from time to time in part permanently  reduce, the Revolving
Commitment Amount.  Each such reduction of the Revolving  Commitment Amount
shall be in the  principal  amount of  $1,000,000  or any  higher  integral
multiple of $100,000.  Simultaneously with each reduction or termination of
the  Revolving   Commitment   Amount,   the  Borrowers  shall  pay  to  the
Administrative  Agent for the  account of each  Lender the  Commitment  Fee
accrued on the amount of the Revolving  Commitment Amount of such Lender so
terminated or reduced through the date thereof.

     (B) Mandatory  Reductions of Revolving  Commitment Amount. On the date
of any Mandatory Prepayment Event, the Revolving Commitment Amount shall be
permanently  reduced by an amount (if any) equal to the Designated Proceeds
of such  Mandatory  Prepayment  Event over the  amount (if any)  applied to
prepay Term Loans pursuant to Section 6.2(B).

     (C) All Reductions of the Commitments. All reductions of the Revolving
Commitment  Amount shall reduce the  Commitments pro rata among the Lenders
according to their respective Percentages.

     6.2  Prepayments.
          -----------

     (A) Voluntary Prepayments.  The Borrowers may from time to time prepay
the Loans in whole or in part;  provided that, the Borrowers shall give the
Administrative  Agent (which  shall  promptly  advise each  Lender)  notice
thereof  not  later  than  11:00  A.M.,  Chicago  time,  on the day of such
prepayment  (which  shall be a Business  Day),  specifying  the Loans to be
prepaid and the date and amount of prepayment.  Any such partial prepayment
shall be in an amount  equal to $500,000 or a higher  integral  multiple of
$100,000.

     (B) Mandatory Prepayments.

     (i) The  Borrowers  shall  make a  prepayment  of the  Loans  upon the
occurrence of any of the following (each a "Mandatory Prepayment Event") at
the following times and in the following  amounts (such applicable  amounts
being referred to as "Designated Proceeds"):

          (a)  Concurrently   with  the   receipt  by  the  Parent  or  any
               Subsidiary  of any Net Cash  Proceeds from any Asset Sale in
               excess of $10,000 for any individual  Asset Sale and $50,000
               for all Asset Sales on or after the Closing Date (other than
               Asset Sales permitted by clauses (i), (ii), (iii), (iv), and
               (viii)  of  Section  10.11(A)),   unless  the  Parent  or  a
               Subsidiary   delivers   a   Reinvestment   Notice   to   the
               Administrative  Agent in respect of such Net Cash  Proceeds,
               in an  amount  equal  to  100% of such  Net  Cash  Proceeds;
               provided,  however, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the
               Borrowers  shall  make a  prepayment  of the  Loans  on each
               Reinvestment  Prepayment  Date in an amount equal to 100% of
               the  Reinvestment  Prepayment  Amount  with  respect  to the
               relevant Reinvestment Event.

          (b)  As soon as  possible,  but in any  event no  later  than one
               Business  Day  after the  receipt  by the  Borrowers  or any
               Subsidiary of any Net Cash Proceeds from any issuance of any
               other Debt of the  Borrowers  or any  Subsidiary  (excluding
               Debt  permitted by clauses (A) through (K) of Section 10.7),
               in an amount equal to 100% of such Net Cash Proceeds.

          (c)  As soon as  possible,  but in any  event no  later  than one
               Business  Day  after the  receipt  by the  Borrowers  or any
               Subsidiary  of any Net Cash  Proceeds  from any  issuance of
               equity   securities  of  the  Borrowers  or  any  Subsidiary
               (including a Public Offering, but excluding (1) any issuance
               of shares of  capital  stock  pursuant  to any  employee  or
               director stock option program,  benefit plan or compensation
               program and (2) any issuance by a  Subsidiary  to the Parent
               or another Subsidiary) in an amount equal to 50% of such Net
               Cash Proceeds.

          (d)  As soon as  possible,  but in any  event no  later  than one
               Business  Day  after the  receipt  by the  Borrowers  or any
               domestic Subsidiary of any funds repatriated to the Borrower
               or such domestic Subsidiary by a non-domestic  Subsidiary in
               an amount equal to 100% of such repatriated funds.

          (e)  Immediately  upon the receipt by any Credit Party,  the full
               amount of any and all payments in respect of tax refunds any
               Credit Party receives.

     All prepayments of the Loans pursuant to this Section  6.2(B)(i) shall
be applied  first to the  remaining  installments  of the Term Loans in the
inverse order of maturity until paid in full, second, to the balance of all
outstanding  Revolving  Loans  until  paid  in  full,  and  third,  as cash
collateral as provided in Section 2.3(F).

     To the  extent any or all of the Net Cash  Proceeds  subject to clause
(a) of Section  6.2(B)  attributable  to Asset Sales by  Non-United  States
Subsidiaries  are prohibited or delayed by applicable  local law from being
repatriated to the United States,  the portion of such Net Cash Proceeds so
affected shall not be required to be paid at the time provided  above,  and
shall  be  deposited  in  an  escrow  account  under  the  control  of  the
Administrative   Agent  pursuant  to  the  terms  of  an  escrow  agreement
satisfactory in form and substance to the Administrative  Agent, until such
time as the  applicable  local law will permit  repatriation  to the United
States.  If and when repatriation of any of such affected Net Cash Proceeds
is permitted  under the applicable  local law, such  repatriation  shall be
immediately effected and such repatriated Net Cash Proceeds will be applied
in the manner set forth in this Agreement.

     (ii) If on any day the Revolver  Outstandings exceed the lesser of (a)
the Borrowing Base and (b) Revolving Commitment Availability, the Borrowers
shall first  immediately  prepay Revolving Loans in an amount sufficient to
eliminate  such excess,  and second,  cash  collateralize  the  outstanding
Letters of Credit in an amount sufficient to eliminate such excess.

     (iii)  If on any day on  which  the  Revolving  Commitment  Amount  is
reduced  pursuant  to  Section  6.1(B)  the  Revolver  Outstandings  exceed
Revolving  Commitment  Availability,  the Borrowers shall first immediately
prepay  Revolving  Loans in an amount  sufficient to eliminate such excess,
and second,  cash  collateralize  the  outstanding  Letters of Credit in an
amount sufficient to eliminate such excess.

        SECTION 7. MAKING AND PRORATION OF PAYMENTS; SETOFF; TAXES.
                   -----------------------------------------------

     7.1 Making of  Payments.  All  payments of principal of or interest on
the Notes,  and of all Commitment Fees and Letter of Credit fees,  shall be
made by the Borrowers to the Administrative Agent in immediately  available
funds at the office  specified by the  Administrative  Agent not later than
noon (Chicago, Illinois time) on the date due and funds received after that
time shall be deemed to have been received by the  Administrative  Agent on
the next following  Business Day. The  Administrative  Agent shall promptly
but in no event less  frequently  than weekly remit to each Lender or other
holder of a Note its share of all such payments received in collected funds
by the  Administrative  Agent for the account of such Lender or holder. All
payments  under Section 8.1 shall be made by the Borrowers  directly to the
Lender entitled thereto.

     7.2  Application of Certain  Payments.  Each repayment of principal of
the Revolving Loans and other Revolver  Outstandings shall be first applied
to repay Revolving Loans then  outstanding as the Borrowers shall direct by
notice received by the  Administrative  Agent on or before the date of such
payment  or, in the absence of such  notice,  as the  Administrative  Agent
determines in its discretion  until such Revolving  Loans are paid in full,
and second,  deposited in the Cash Collateral Account to cash collateralize
105% of the Stated Amount of the Letters of Credit then  outstanding.  Upon
the  drawing of any Letter of Credit for which funds are on deposit in such
Cash  Collateral  Account,  such funds  shall be applied to  reimburse  the
Issuing Bank.  Concurrently with each remittance to any Lender of its share
of any such payment,  the Administrative  Agent shall advise such Lender as
to the application of such payment.

     7.3 Due Date  Extension.  If any payment of principal or interest with
respect  to any of the  Notes,  or of  Commitment  Fees or Letter of Credit
fees,  falls due on a day that is not a  Business  Day,  then such due date
shall be extended to the  immediately  following  Business  Day and, in the
case of principal,  additional interest shall accrue and be payable for the
period of any such extension.

     7.4 Setoff.  The Borrowers  agree that the Agents and each Lender have
all rights of setoff and bankers' lien  provided by applicable  law, and in
addition thereto, the Borrowers agree that at any time any Event of Default
exists, the  Administrative  Agent and each Lender may apply to the payment
of any  Obligations of the Borrowers,  whether or not then due, any and all
balances,  credits,  deposits,  accounts or moneys of the Borrowers then or
thereafter with the Administrative Agent or such Lender.

     7.5  Proration of Payments.  If any Lender shall obtain any payment or
other recovery (whether voluntary, involuntary, by application of offset or
otherwise,  but excluding  any payment  pursuant to Section 8.7 or 15.8) on
account  of  principal  of or  interest  on any Note (or on  account of its
participation  in any  Letter of Credit) in excess of its pro rata share of
payments  and other  recoveries  obtained  by all  Lenders  on  account  of
principal  of and  interest on Notes (or such  participation)  then held by
them, such Lender shall purchase from the other Lenders such participations
in the Notes (or  subparticipations  in Letters of Credit)  held by them as
shall be  necessary  to cause  such  purchasing  Lender to share the excess
payment or other recovery ratably with each of them;  provided that, if all
or any  portion  of the  excess  payment or other  recovery  is  thereafter
recovered from such purchasing  Lender, the purchase shall be rescinded and
the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery.

     7.6 Taxes.  (A) All  payments of  principal  of, and  interest on, the
Loans and all other amounts payable  hereunder shall be made free and clear
of and without deduction for any present or future income, excise, stamp or
franchise  taxes and  other  taxes,  fees,  duties,  withholdings  or other
charges of any nature  whatsoever  imposed  by any  taxing  authority,  but
excluding net income taxes,  franchise  taxes imposed in lieu of net income
taxes,  and branch  profit taxes imposed on either Agent or any Lender as a
result of a present or former  connection  between such Agent or Lender and
the  jurisdiction of the  Governmental  Authority  imposing such tax or any
political  subdivision or taxing  authority  thereof or therein (other than
any such  connection  arising  solely  from  such  Agent or  Lender  having
executed,  delivered,  or performed  its  obligations  or received  payment
under,  or  enforced,  this  Agreement  or any other  Loan  Document).  All
nonexcluded  items  identified  in the preceding  sentence are  hereinafter
called "Taxes". If any withholding or deduction from any payment to be made
by the Borrowers  hereunder is required in respect of any Taxes pursuant to
any applicable law, rule or regulation, then the Borrowers will:

     (i)    pay directly to the relevant authority the full amount required
            to be so withheld or deducted;

     (ii)   promptly  forward  to  the  Administrative  Agent  an  official
            receipt or other documentation  reasonably  satisfactory to the
            Administrative Agent evidencing such payment to such authority;
            and

     (iii)  pay to the Administrative  Agent for the account of the Lenders
            such  additional  amount or amounts as is  necessary  to ensure
            that the net amount actually received by each Lender will equal
            the full  amount such Lender  would have  received  had no such
            withholding or deduction been required.

     Moreover,   if  any   Taxes  are   directly   asserted   against   the
Administrative  Agent or any Lender with respect to any payment received by
the Administrative Agent or such Lender hereunder, the Administrative Agent
or such Lender may pay such Taxes and the Borrowers  will promptly pay such
additional  amounts  (including  any  penalty,  interest and expense) as is
necessary so that the net amount  received by such Person after the payment
of such Taxes  (including any Taxes on such additional  amount) shall equal
the  amount  such  Person  would  have  received  had such  Taxes  not been
asserted.

     Notwithstanding the foregoing,  the Borrowers shall not be required to
increase any such amounts payable to a Lender with respect to United States
withholding taxes (x) imposed on amounts payable to such Lender at the time
such Lender  becomes a party to this Agreement or (y) imposed other than as
a result of a change in treaty,  law or regulations  (or the application or
interpretation  thereof) after the date such Lender becomes a party to this
Agreement, except in both case (x) and (y) to the extent that such Lender's
assignor  (if any) was  entitled,  at the time of  assignment,  to  receive
additional amounts from Borrowers pursuant to this Section 7.6.

     (B) If the Borrowers fail to pay any Taxes when due to the appropriate
taxing  authority  or fail to remit to the  Administrative  Agent,  for the
account of the respective Lenders,  the required receipts or other required
documentary  evidence,  the Borrowers  shall  indemnify the Lenders for any
incremental  Taxes,  interest or penalties  that may become  payable by any
Lender as a result of any such failure. For purposes of this Section 7.6, a
distribution  hereunder by the Administrative Agent or any Lender to or for
the account of any Lender shall be deemed a payment by the Borrowers.

     (C) Each  Lender  that (i) is not a United  States  person  within the
meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code and (ii)(a) is a party hereto on
the Closing  Date or (b) becomes an assignee of an interest  under  Section
15.8 of this  Agreement  after the  Closing  Date  (unless  such Lender was
already a Lender  hereunder  immediately  prior to such  assignment)  shall
timely  execute and deliver to the Borrowers and the  Administrative  Agent
one or more (as the Borrowers or the  Administrative  Agent may  reasonably
request) United States Internal  Revenue Service Form W-8ECI or Form W-8BEN
or successor  forms or documents,  appropriately  completed,  true and duly
executed, as may be applicable to establish that such Lender is exempt from
withholding  or deduction of Taxes on payments by the Borrowers  under this
Agreement.  A Person that becomes a  Participant  shall timely  execute and
deliver  to  the  Lender   from  which  the   Participant   purchased   the
participating   interest  one  or  more  (as  the  Lender  from  which  the
Participant  purchased the participating  interest may reasonably  request)
United  States  Internal  Revenue  Service  Form  W-8ECI or Form  W-8BEN or
successor  forms  or  documents,  appropriately  completed,  true  and duly
executed, as may be applicable to establish that such Participant is exempt
from withholding or deduction of Taxes. The Borrowers shall not be required
to pay additional amounts to any Lender pursuant to this Section 7.6 to the
extent that the  obligation to pay such  additional  amounts would not have
arisen but for the failure of such Lender or a  Participant  to comply with
this paragraph.  Each such  non-United  States Lender shall promptly notify
the  Borrowers  at any time such  Lender  determines  that it can no longer
provide any previously delivered certificate to the Borrowers (or any other
form of certification  adopted by the United States taxing  authorities for
such purpose).

     (D) The  obligations  of the  Borrowers  under  this  Section  7.6 are
subject to the  limitation  set out in Section  15.8(A).  The agreements in
this Section 7.6 shall survive the  termination  of this  Agreement and the
payments of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.

                        SECTION 8. INCREASED COSTS.
                                   ---------------

     8.1 Increased Costs. If any Lender shall reasonably determine that the
adoption or phase-in of any  applicable  law, rule or regulation  regarding
capital   adequacy,   or  any  change   therein,   or  any  change  in  the
interpretation  or  administration  thereof by any Governmental  Authority,
central  bank or  comparable  agency  charged  with the  interpretation  or
administration   thereof,  or  compliance  by  any  Lender  or  any  Person
controlling  such Lender with any request or  directive  regarding  capital
adequacy  (whether  or not having the force of law) of any such  authority,
central bank or comparable agency, has or would have the effect of reducing
the rate of return on such Lender's or such controlling Person's capital as
a consequence  of such Lender's  obligations  under this Agreement or under
any  Letter of Credit  to a level  below  that  which  such  Lender or such
controlling  Person could have  achieved but for such  adoption,  change or
compliance  (taking into  consideration  such Lender's or such  controlling
Person's  policies with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by
such Lender or such  controlling  Person to be material,  then from time to
time,  upon ten days' prior  written  notice by such Lender  (which  notice
shall be accompanied by a statement setting forth the basis for such demand
and a calculation  of the amount  thereof in reasonable  detail,  a copy of
which shall be furnished to the Administrative  Agent), the Borrowers shall
pay to such Lender  such  additional  amount or amounts as will  compensate
such Lender or such  controlling  Person for such reduction,  to the extent
that such  Lender  reasonably  determines  such  increase  in capital to be
allocable  to  the  existence  of  such  Lender's   commitment  under  this
Agreement. A certificate as to such amounts submitted to the Borrowers by a
Lender is conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.

     8.2 Mitigation of Circumstances. Each Lender shall promptly notify the
Borrowers  and the  Administrative  Agent  of any  event  of  which  it has
knowledge that will result in, and will use reasonable  commercial  efforts
available  to it  (and  not,  in such  Lender's  sole  judgment,  otherwise
disadvantageous to such Lender) to mitigate or avoid, any obligation by the
Borrowers  to pay any amount  pursuant to Section  7.6 or 8.1 (and,  if any
Lender has given notice of any such event described in above and thereafter
such  event  ceases to exist,  such  Lender  shall  promptly  so notify the
Borrowers and the  Administrative  Agent).  Without limiting the foregoing,
each Lender will designate a different  funding office if such  designation
will avoid (or reduce the cost to the Borrowers of) any event  described in
the preceding sentence and such designation will not, in such Lender's sole
judgment, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender.

     8.3   Conclusiveness   of   Statements;    Survival   of   Provisions.
Determinations  and statements of any Lender  pursuant to Section 8.1 shall
be conclusive absent manifest error.  Lenders may use reasonable  averaging
and attribution methods in determining compensation under Sections 8.1, and
the  provisions  of such  Sections  shall  survive  repayment of the Loans,
cancellation  of the Notes,  cancellation  or  expiration of the Letters of
Credit and any termination of this Agreement.

                SECTION 9. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.
                           ------------------------------

     To induce the Agents and the Lenders to enter into this  Agreement and
to induce the Lenders to make Loans and issue and  purchase  participations
in Letters of Credit under this Agreement, the Credit Parties represent and
warrant to the Agents and the Lenders that:

     9.1  Organization.  Each  Credit  Party  and  each  Subsidiary  is  an
organization  duly formed,  validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of the jurisdiction of its  organization.  The Credit Parties and each
Subsidiary  are in good  standing and are duly  qualified to do business in
each  jurisdiction  where,  because  of the nature of their  activities  or
properties,  such qualification is required,  except for such jurisdictions
where the failure to so qualify would not have a Material  Adverse  Effect.
Each Credit Party and each Subsidiary has the requisite power and authority
to own or hold under lease the  properties it purports to own or hold under
lease,  to transact the business it transacts and proposes to transact,  to
execute and deliver  this  Agreement  and the other Loan  Documents  and to
perform the  provisions of this  Agreement and the other Loan  Documents to
which it is a party.

     9.2 Authorization;  No Conflict.  Each Credit Party is duly authorized
to execute and  deliver  each Loan  Document  to which it is a party,  each
Borrower is duly  authorized to borrow monies under this Agreement and each
Credit Party is duly authorized to perform its Obligations  under each Loan
Document to which it is a party. The execution, delivery and performance by
each Credit Party of this Agreement and each Loan Document to which it is a
party, and the borrowings by each Borrower under this Agreement, do not and
will not (a) require any consent or approval of any governmental  agency or
authority that has not been obtained or (b) conflict with (i) any provision
of law, (ii) each Credit Party's  articles or certificate of  incorporation
and  bylaws  or  similar  organizational  documents,   (iii)  any  material
agreement (other than Section 8 of the Pledge Agreement)  binding upon each
Credit   Party  or  its   properties   or  assets  or  (iv)  any  court  or
administrative  order or decree applicable to such Credit Party, and do not
and will not require,  or result in, the creation or imposition of any Lien
on any  asset  of the  Credit  Parties  (other  than  Liens in favor of the
Administrative Agent created pursuant to the Collateral Documents).

     9.3 Validity and Binding Nature. Each of this Agreement and each other
Loan Document to which any Credit Party is a party is the legal,  valid and
binding  obligation of such Credit Party,  enforceable  against such Credit
Party in accordance with its terms,  subject to bankruptcy,  insolvency and
similar laws affecting the  enforceability  of creditors'  rights generally
and to general principles of equity.

     9.4 Financial  Statements.  The Parent has delivered to the Agents and
each Lender that is a party to this Agreement on the Closing Date copies of
the consolidated  financial statements listed on Schedule 9.4 of the Parent
and its Subsidiaries.  All of such financial statements  (including in each
case the  related  schedules  and notes)  fairly  present  in all  material
respects  the  consolidated  financial  condition  of the  Parent  and  its
Subsidiaries  as of the  dates  thereof  and the  consolidated  results  of
operations  and  the  consolidated   cash  flows  of  the  Parent  and  its
Subsidiaries  for the periods  covered  thereby.  As of the  Closing  Date,
except as set forth on Schedule 9.4, no Credit Party or any  Subsidiary has
any liability or unusual or long-term  commitment that could  reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect and that is not reflected in the
financial statements referred to above.

     9.5 No Material  Adverse Change.  Since November 6, 2002 and except as
disclosed in reports of the Parent on Form 10K,  Form 10Q and Form 8K filed
with the SEC prior to the date hereof,  there has been no material  adverse
change in the  condition  (financial  or  otherwise),  operations,  assets,
business,  properties or prospects of the Parent and its Subsidiaries taken
as a whole.

     9.6  Litigation  and  Contingent  Liabilities.  Except as disclosed in
Schedule 9.6, no litigation  (including  derivative  actions),  arbitration
proceeding or  governmental  investigation  or proceeding is pending or, to
any Credit Party's or any Subsidiary's knowledge, threatened against any of
the Credit Parties or any Subsidiary  that could  reasonably be expected to
have a Material  Adverse  Effect.  As of the Closing  Date,  other than any
liability  incident to such litigation or  proceedings,  none of the Credit
Parties or any  Subsidiary  has any  material  contingent  liabilities  not
listed on Schedule 9.6 or permitted by Section 10.7.

     9.7 Ownership of Properties;  Liens. Except as permitted under Section
10.8, each of the Credit Parties and each Subsidiary owns good title to all
of its personal  properties  and assets,  tangible and  intangible,  of any
nature whatsoever  (including  patents,  trademarks,  trade names,  service
marks and copyrights), free and clear of all Liens.

     9.8  Subsidiaries.  As of the  Closing  Date,  no Credit  Party owns a
Subsidiary,  whether  directly  or  indirectly,  other  than as  listed  on
Schedule  9.8.  Each of the Persons  listed on  Schedule  9.8 (which may be
supplemented  by the  Credit  Parties  from  time to time  to  reflect  the
addition or elimination of  Subsidiaries as permitted by this Agreement) is
a direct or indirect  Subsidiary of a Borrower,  and the percentage of each
such  Subsidiary's  equity  securities  owned by a Borrower is set forth on
Schedule 9.8.

     9.9  Pension and  Welfare  Plans.  (A) Except as set forth on Schedule
9.9,  during the  twelve-consecutive-month  period prior to the date of the
execution  and delivery of this  Agreement or the making of any Loan or the
issuance of any Letter of Credit  under this  Agreement,  (i) no steps have
been taken to  terminate  any  Pension  Plan,  except  with  respect to the
Pension Plan for employees of the ROHN Division of UNR Industries, Inc. and
UNR-ROHN,  Inc. (the "ROHN Pension Plan"); provided that, as of the date of
any such termination,  the ROHN Pension Plan satisfies the requirements for
a standard  termination under Section 4041(b) of ERISA, and no other Credit
Party  is  required  to make any  contribution  to the  ROHN  Pension  Plan
pursuant to such termination and (ii) no contribution  failure has occurred
with  respect to any Pension Plan  sufficient  to give rise to a Lien under
Section 302(f) of ERISA.  Except as set forth on Schedule 9.9, no condition
exists or event or  transaction  has  occurred  with respect to any Pension
Plan  that  could  result  in the  incurrence  by any  Credit  Party of any
material  liability  for a violation of  applicable  law,  material fine or
material penalty. No Credit Party has any contingent liability with respect
to any  post-retirement  benefit under a Welfare Plan, other than liability
for continuation  coverage  described in Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of
ERISA in excess of $10,000,000.

     (B) Except as set forth on Schedule 9.9, to the extent that  liability
in excess of $300,000 in the  aggregate  would result to one or more Credit
Parties, (i) all contributions (if any) have been made to any Multiemployer
Pension  Plan that are required to be made by any Credit Party or any other
member  of the  Controlled  Group  under  the  terms  of the plan or of any
collective  bargaining  agreement or by  applicable  law;  (ii) neither any
Credit  Party nor any  member of the  Controlled  Group  has  withdrawn  or
partially  withdrawn  from any  Multiemployer  Pension  Plan,  incurred any
withdrawal  liability  that is unpaid on the date of the making of any Loan
or the issuance of any Letter of Credit under this  Agreement  with respect
to any such  plan,  received  written  notice of any  claim or  demand  for
withdrawal  liability or partial  withdrawal  liability from any such plan,
and no condition  has occurred  that,  if  continued,  might  reasonably be
expected  to result in a  withdrawal  or partial  withdrawal  from any such
plan;  and (iii) neither any Credit Party nor any member of the  Controlled
Group has received any written notice that any  Multiemployer  Pension Plan
is in reorganization, that increased contributions may be required to avoid
a reduction in plan benefits or the  imposition of any excise tax, that any
such plan is or has been  funded at a rate  less than that  required  under
Section  412 of the Code,  that any such plan is or may be  terminated,  or
that any such plan is or may become  insolvent.  Each Pension Plan intended
to be  qualified  pursuant  to  Section  401(a) of the Code has  received a
favorable  determination  from  the  Internal  Revenue  Service  as to  its
qualified  status  covering such matters for which the applicable  remedial
amendment period has expired.

     9.10  Investment  Company Act. No Credit Party or any Subsidiary is an
"investment company" or a company "controlled" by an "investment  company",
within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940.

     9.11  Public  Utility  Holding  Company  Act.  No Credit  Party or any
Subsidiary is a "holding company",  or a "subsidiary company" of a "holding
company",  or an  "affiliate"  of a "holding  company" or of a  "subsidiary
company" of a "holding  company",  within the meaning of the Public Utility
Holding Company Act of 1935.

     9.12 Regulation U. No Credit Party is engaged  principally,  or as one
of its important  activities,  in the business of extending  credit for the
purpose of purchasing or carrying Margin Stock.

     9.13  Taxes.  Each Credit  Party and each  Subsidiary  has filed,  has
caused  to be  filed or has  been  included  in all  material  tax  returns
(Federal, state, local, foreign and other material tax returns) required to
be filed by or on behalf of each of the Credit Parties and each  Subsidiary
and has paid or caused to be paid all material taxes and other governmental
charges  due  for the  periods  covered  thereby,  including  interest  and
penalties,  other than any such taxes or charges (a) for which a timely and
proper  extension has been obtained or (b) that are being contested in good
faith and by proper  proceedings and as to which  appropriate  reserves (in
accordance  with  GAAP) are  being  maintained,  unless  and until any Lien
resulting  therefrom  attaches  to its  property  and  becomes  enforceable
against its other creditors.  Either the federal income tax returns of each
of the Credit Parties and each Subsidiary have been audited by the Internal
Revenue Service and such audits have been closed or the period during which
any  assessments  may be made by the Internal  Revenue  Service has expired
without waiver or extension,  for all years up to and including Fiscal Year
1998. The reserves for taxes reflected on the balance sheets of each of the
Credit  Parties and each  Subsidiary  submitted to the Agents in accordance
with the terms of Section  10.1 will be  adequate  in amount in  accordance
with GAAP for the payment of all  liabilities for all taxes (whether or not
disputed) of each of the Credit Parties and each Subsidiary accrued through
the date of such balance sheet.

     9.14 [Intentionally omitted].

     9.15 Environmental Matters. Except as set forth on Schedule 9.15:

     (A) No Violations.  Neither any Credit Party nor any  Subsidiary,  nor
(to any Credit Party's or any  Subsidiary's  knowledge) any operator of the
Borrowers' or any Credit Party's  properties,  is in violation,  or alleged
violation,  of any judgment,  decree, order, law, permit,  license, rule or
regulation  pertaining to  environmental  matters,  including those arising
under RCRA, CERCLA,  the Superfund  Amendments and  Reauthorization  Act of

remedial actions or (ii)  individually or in the aggregate  otherwise could
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

     (C)  Handling  of  Hazardous  Substances.  (i) No Credit  Party or any
Subsidiary  has  used,  nor  (to any  Credit  Party's  or any  Subsidiary's
knowledge)  has any  operator of any Real  Property of any Credit  Party or
Subsidiary  used,  any portion of the Real  Property or other assets of any
Credit Party or any  Subsidiary  for the handling,  processing,  storage or
disposal of  Hazardous  Substances  except in  accordance  in all  material
respects with  applicable  Environmental  Laws and no  underground  tank or

or from any  Real  Property  or other  assets  of any  Credit  Party or any

Property  or  assets,  (iv)  to any  Credit  Party's  or  any  Subsidiary's
knowledge,  there have been no Releases of Hazardous  Substances  on, upon,

Subsidiary and (v) any Hazardous Substances generated by the Credit Parties
and their  Subsidiaries  have been  transported  offsite  only by  properly
licensed  carriers  and  delivered  only to licensed  treatment or disposal
facilities.

     9.16 Insurance.  Set forth on Schedule 9.16 is a complete and accurate
summary  of the  property  and  casualty  insurance  program  of the Credit
Parties and their  Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date (including the names
of all insurers,  policy numbers,  expiration  dates,  amounts and types of
coverage, annual premiums, exclusions, deductibles,  self-insured retention
and a  description  in  reasonable  detail of any  self-insurance  program,
retrospective  rating plan,  fronting  arrangement or other risk assumption
arrangement involving the Credit Parties and their Subsidiaries).

     9.17 Real  Property.  The legal  descriptions  contained  on  Schedule
9.17(A)  correctly  describe  all of the  Land  that is a part of the  Real
Property owned by a Credit Party as of the Closing Date.  Each Credit Party
has good  and  marketable  title in fee  simple  (or its  equivalent  under
applicable  law) to its Real  Property  free  from all  Liens,  claims  and
encumbrances   except   for  the   security   interests   granted   to  the
Administrative   Agent  under  this  Agreement  and  the  other  Collateral
Documents  and except for Liens  permitted  under  Section  10.8. As of the
Closing  Date,  the leases  listed on  Schedule  9.17(B) are all leases (as
amended as of the Closing  Date) under which a Credit Party has a leasehold
interest in its leased real  property  and under which such Credit Party is
not in default,  nor has any event occurred that, with the lapse of time or
notice or both,  would  constitute a default by such Credit Party under any
of such leases of such Credit Party's leased real property  except for such
defaults that could  reasonably not be expected to have a Material  Adverse
Effect.  Each Credit Party owns a valid and subsisting  leasehold estate in
its  leased  real  property  free from all Liens,  claims and  encumbrances
except for the security interests granted to the Administrative Agent under
this Agreement and the Collateral  Documents and except for Liens permitted
under Section 10.8.

     9.18  Information.  No  statement  or  information  contained  in this
Agreement,  any other Loan Document, or any other document,  certificate or
statement  furnished  by or on behalf of any Credit  Party to the Agents or
the Lenders,  or any of them, for use in connection  with the  transactions
contemplated  by this Agreement or the other Loan  Documents,  contained or
contains  any untrue  statement  of a material  fact or omitted or omits to
state a material fact necessary to make the statements  contained herein or
therein not misleading  (it being  recognized by the Agents and the Lenders
that any projections and forecasts provided by the Credit Parties are based
on good faith estimates and  assumptions  believed by the Credit Parties to
be reasonable as of the date of the  applicable  projections or assumptions
and that actual  results  during the period or periods  covered by any such
projections and forecasts may differ from projected or forecasted results).

     9.19  Intellectual  Property.  The  Credit  Parties  and each of their
Subsidiaries  own and  possess or have a license or other  right to use all
such patents,  patent rights,  trademarks,  trademark rights,  trade names,
trade name rights, service marks, service mark rights and copyrights as are
necessary  for the conduct of the business of the Credit  Parties and their
Subsidiaries  as conducted on the Closing  Date,  without any  infringement
upon rights of others that could  reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

     9.20 Labor  Matters.  Except as set forth on Schedule  9.20, as of the
Closing Date neither any Credit Party nor any  Subsidiary is subject to any
labor  or  collective  bargaining  agreement.  There  are  no  existing  or
threatened  strikes,  lockouts or other labor disputes involving any Credit
Party or any Subsidiary that singly or in the aggregate could reasonably be
expected to have a Material  Adverse  Effect.  Hours  worked by and payment
made to employees of the Credit Parties and their  Subsidiaries  are not in
violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act or any other applicable law, rule
or  regulation   dealing  with  such  matters.   The  consummation  of  the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not give rise to any right
of termination or right of renegotiation on the part of any union under any
collective bargaining agreement by which any Credit Party or any Subsidiary
is bound.

     9.21  Burdensome  Obligations.  Neither  the  Credit  Parties  nor any
Subsidiary  is a party to any  agreement  or  contract  or  subject  to any
corporate or partnership  restriction  that could reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect.

     9.22 No Default. No Default or Event of Default exists or would result
from the incurring by the Credit  Parties of any Debt under this  Agreement
or under any other Loan Document.  No material  agreement or other material
instrument to which any Credit Party or any  Subsidiary is a party has been
terminated  or  breached by such Credit  Party or such  Subsidiary  if such
termination  or breach  could  reasonably  be  expected  to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

     9.23 Securities  Matters.  The making of the Loans, the application of
the proceeds and repayment thereof by the Borrowers and the consummation of
the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement,  the other Loan Documents
and the Asset  Purchase  Documents  will not violate any  provision  of any
federal or state securities  statutes,  rules or regulations,  or any order
issued by the SEC (collectively, the "Securities Laws").

     9.24 Use of  Proceeds.  The  Borrowers  will apply the proceeds of the
Loans and Letters of Credit under this Agreement for their working  capital
requirements  and  general  corporate  purposes  (which  shall not  include
purchasing or carrying Margin Stock within the meaning of Regulation U).

     9.25  Compliance  with Laws. No Credit Party or Subsidiary  is, to the
best of its  knowledge,  in violation of any law,  rule or regulation or in
default with respect to any  judgment,  writ,  injunction  or decree of any
Governmental Authority the violation of which, or a default with respect to
which, could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

     9.26 Security Interests. Each of the Collateral Documents has created,
as  security  for  the  obligations  hereunder,  a  continuing,  valid  and
enforceable security interest in and Lien on all of the Collateral in favor
of the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Lenders and, except with
respect to motor vehicles and Collateral permitted to be located outside of
the United States  pursuant to Section  10.29,  such  security  interest is
perfected  and  ranks  superior  to and  prior to the  rights  of all third
parties and is subject to no other Liens,  other than Liens permitted under
Section  10.8  of  this   Agreement.   Other  than  motor   vehicle   title
registration,  no filings or recordings  are required to perfect within the
United States the security interests created under any Collateral  Document
except for  filings or  recordings  required  in  connection  with any such
Collateral Document that shall have been made on or about the Closing Date.

     9.27 Governmental Approvals.  The making of the Loans, the application
of the proceeds and repayment thereof by the Borrowers and the consummation
of  the  transactions  contemplated  by  this  Agreement,  the  other  Loan
Documents  and the Asset  Purchase  Documents  do not require any  material
consent or approval of,  registration or filing with, or any other material
action by, any Governmental  Authority,  except those set forth on Schedule
9.27  and  filings  necessary  to  perfect  Liens  created  under  the Loan
Documents.

     9.28 Liens. Except for Liens existing on the Closing Date as reflected
on Schedule 10.8, there are no Liens of any nature whatsoever on any assets
of the Credit Parties or any of their  respective  Subsidiaries  other than
(a) Liens  permitted  under Section 10.8 of this Agreement and (b) Liens in
favor of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders. Neither any Credit Party
nor  any  Subsidiary  is a  party  to any  contract,  agreement,  lease  or
instrument the  performance of which,  either  unconditionally  or upon the
happening of an event,  will result in or require the creation of a Lien on
any assets of a Credit  Party or a  Subsidiary  or  otherwise  violate this
Agreement.

     9.29 Asset Purchase Documents.

     (A) The Borrowers have heretofore  furnished the Agents  substantially
final  copies  of the Asset  Purchase  Documents.  The  copies of the Asset
Purchase Documents  furnished to the Agents prior to or on the Closing Date
will be or are,  as the case may be,  fully  executed,  true,  correct  and
complete.

     (B) Each of the Credit Parties and, to the Credit Parties'  knowledge,
prior to the consummation of the Asset Purchase  Agreement each other party
to the Asset Purchase  Documents,  has duly taken all necessary  corporate,
partnership  or other  organizational  action to authorize  the  execution,
delivery  and   performance  of  the  Asset  Purchase   Documents  and  the
consummation of transactions contemplated thereby.

     (C) The actions  contemplated  by the Asset  Purchase  Agreement  will
comply  with  all  applicable   legal   requirements,   and  all  necessary
governmental, regulatory, creditor, shareholder, partner and other material
consents,  approvals and  exemptions  required to be obtained by the Credit
Parties  and,  to the Credit  Parties'  knowledge,  each other party to the
Asset Purchase  Documents in connection  with the Asset Purchase  Agreement
will be,  prior to  consummation  of the  Asset  Purchase  Agreement,  duly
obtained  and will be in full  force and  effect.  All  applicable  waiting
periods with respect to the Asset Purchase Agreement will have expired,  as
of the  consummation  of the Asset Purchase  Agreement,  without any action
being  taken  by  any  competent  governmental  authority  that  restrains,
prevents or imposes  material  adverse  conditions upon the consummation of
the Asset Purchase Agreement.

     (D) The execution and delivery of the Asset Purchase  Documents do not
and will not, and the  consummation  of the Asset  Purchase  Agreement will
not,  violate any statute or regulation  of the United  States  (including,
without  limitation,  any  Securities  Laws)  or  of  any  state  or  other
applicable  jurisdiction,  or any order, judgment or decree of any court or
governmental  body binding on the Credit Parties or, to the Credit Parties'
knowledge,  any other party to the Asset Purchase Documents, or result in a
breach  of,  or  constitute  a  default  under,  any  material   agreement,
indenture,  instrument, judgment, order or decree to which any Credit Party
is a party or by which any Credit Party is bound or, to the Credit Parties'
knowledge,  to which any other party to the Asset  Purchase  Documents is a
party or by which any such party is bound.

     (E)  No  statement  or  representation  made  in  the  Asset  Purchase
Documents  by any Credit  Party or, to any Credit  Party's  knowledge,  any
other Person,  contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements made therein,  in light of the  circumstances  under
which they are made, not misleading.

     9.30 Tax  Refunds.  On the Closing  Date,  the Credit  Parties in good
faith believe that the Credit  Parties' sale of the assets  pursuant to the
Asset Purchase  Agreement,  together with other Tax losses sustained by the
Credit Parties, will result in Tax losses sufficient to generate income Tax
refunds in an aggregate amount of  approximately  $24,000,000 by means of a
carryback of such losses from the Credit  Parties' 2002 income Tax years to
their earlier income Tax years. No Credit Party is a party to any action or
proceeding,  nor to the best of any Credit Party's  knowledge,  is any such
action or proceeding  contemplated  or  threatened,  for the  assessment or
collection  of any Tax,  and no  deficiency  notices or  reports  have been
received by any Credit  Party in respect of any Tax that,  in either  case,
could reduce the Tax refund to which such Credit Party is entitled. For the
purposes of this Section 9.30, "Tax" or "Taxes" means all net income, gross
income,  gross  receipts,  sales,  use,  ad valorem,  transfer,  franchise,
profits,  license,  withholding,  payroll,  employment,  excise, severance,
stamp,  occupation,  premium,  property or windfall profits taxes,  customs
duties or other taxes, fees, assessments or charges of any kind whatsoever,
together  with  any  interest  and  any  penalties,  additions  to  tax  or
additional amounts imposed by any taxing authority (domestic or foreign).

     9.31 Survival of  Warranties.  All  representations  contained in this
Agreement and the other Loan  Documents  survive the execution and delivery
of this Agreement.

          becoming aware of any of the following, written notice describing

                 the  incurrence by any member of the  Controlled  Group of
                 any material  liability for a violation of applicable law,
                 material fine or material penalty  (including any claim or

                 any Multiemployer  Pension Plan), (e) the amendment by any
                 Credit   Party  of  any   Welfare   Plan   that   provides

                 reduction in plan benefits or the  imposition of an excise
                 tax,  that any such  plan is or has been  funded at a rate

to keep,  their  books  and  records  in  accordance  with  sound  business
practices  sufficient to allow the  preparation of financial  statements in
accordance  with GAAP.  The Credit  Parties  shall  permit,  and cause each
Subsidiary to permit, at any reasonable time and with reasonable notice (or
at any time without  notice if an Event of Default  exists),  any Lender or
either  Agent or any  representative  thereof  to visit any or all of their
offices,  to discuss their financial  matters with their officers and their
independent  auditors (and the Credit Parties  authorize  such  independent
auditors to discuss such financial  matters with any Lender or either Agent
or any representative  thereof), and to examine (and, at the expense of the
Credit Parties,  photocopy  extracts from) any of the Credit Parties' books
or  other  records.  The  Credit  Parties  shall  permit,  and  cause  each
Subsidiary to permit, at any reasonable time and with reasonable notice (or
at any time without notice if an Event of Default exists) the Agents, their
agents, employees or any representative thereof to, on behalf of themselves
and the Lenders (a) inspect the  properties  and  operations  of the Credit
Parties  and of each  Subsidiary,  (b)  inspect  the  Inventory  and  other

more  frequently  than once a year unless an Event of Default has  occurred
and is continuing and (y) at the Credit Parties' sole cost and expense.

     10.3 Maintenance of Property; Insurance;  Condemnation.  (A) Keep, and
cause each  Subsidiary  to keep,  all property  useful and necessary in the
business of the Credit Parties or such Subsidiary in good working order and
condition, ordinary wear and tear excepted.

     (B) Maintain, and cause each Subsidiary to maintain,  with responsible
insurance  companies,  such  insurance  as may be  required  by any  law or
governmental  regulation or court decree or order applicable to it and such
other  insurance,  to such extent and against such hazards and  liabilities
(including business interruption  insurance),  as is customarily maintained
by companies  similarly  situated;  and, upon request of the Administrative
Agent or any Lender,  furnish to the Administrative  Agent or such Lender a
certificate setting forth in reasonable detail the nature and extent of all
insurance  maintained  by the Credit  Parties and their  Subsidiaries.  The
Credit  Parties  shall cause each issuer of an insurance  policy to provide
the  Administrative  Agent with an endorsement (i) containing a lender loss
payable endorsement to the Administrative Agent with respect to each policy
of property or casualty insurance and naming the Administrative Agent as an
additional  insured with respect to each policy of insurance  for liability
for  personal  injury and property  damage,  (ii)  providing  that 30 days'
notice will be given to the Administrative  Agent prior to any cancellation
of, material  reduction or change in coverage provided by or other material
modification  to such policy and (iii)  reasonably  acceptable in all other
respects to the Agents. The Credit Parties shall execute and deliver to the
Administrative  Agent  a  collateral  assignment,  in  form  and  substance
satisfactory to the Agents, of each business interruption  insurance policy
maintained  by the Credit  Parties.  The  Credit  Parties  will  direct all
insurers  under such policies of insurance to pay all proceeds of insurance
policies in excess of $500,000  directly  to  Administrative  Agent for the
benefit of the Lenders to be applied as follows: (x) so long as no Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing or a prepayment has become due under
Section  6.2(B),  the  Administrative  Agent will promptly  comply with the
Credit  Parties'  requests as to such proceeds and (y) at any time an Event
of Default has occurred and is continuing or a prepayment is or will become
due under Section 6.2(B), the Administrative  Agent may apply such proceeds
to the payment of the  Obligations  and  liabilities  of the Credit Parties
then due and payable to the Administrative  Agent or the Lenders under this
Agreement or the other Loan Documents;  provided that, if such proceeds are
paid  to the  Administrative  Agent  solely  as a  result  of a  prepayment
required under Section  6.2(B),  then the  Administrative  Agent will apply
such proceeds to the payment of the Obligations in the manner prescribed in
Section 6.2(B) only to the extent of such prepayment and the Administrative
Agent will promptly comply with the Credit Parties'  requests as to any and
all remaining proceeds.

     (C) UNLESS THE CREDIT PARTIES  PROVIDE THE  ADMINISTRATIVE  AGENT WITH
EVIDENCE  OF  THE  INSURANCE  COVERAGE  REQUIRED  BY  THIS  AGREEMENT,  THE
ADMINISTRATIVE  AGENT MAY PURCHASE INSURANCE AT THE CREDIT PARTIES' EXPENSE
TO PROTECT THE AGENTS' AND THE LENDERS'  INTERESTS IN THE COLLATERAL  UNDER
THE COLLATERAL  DOCUMENTS.  THIS  INSURANCE MAY, BUT NEED NOT,  PROTECT THE
CREDIT  PARTIES'  INTERESTS.  THE COVERAGE  THAT THE  ADMINISTRATIVE  AGENT
PURCHASES MAY NOT PAY ANY CLAIM THAT IS MADE AGAINST THE CREDIT  PARTIES IN
CONNECTION WITH THE COLLATERAL UNDER THE COLLATERAL  DOCUMENTS.  THE CREDIT
PARTIES MAY LATER  CANCEL ANY  INSURANCE  PURCHASED  BY THE  ADMINISTRATIVE
AGENT, BUT ONLY AFTER PROVIDING THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT WITH EVIDENCE THAT
THE CREDIT PARTIES HAVE OBTAINED  INSURANCE AS REQUIRED BY THIS  AGREEMENT.
IF THE  ADMINISTRATIVE  AGENT PURCHASES  INSURANCE FOR THE COLLATERAL UNDER
THE COLLATERAL  DOCUMENTS,  THE CREDIT PARTIES WILL BE RESPONSIBLE  FOR THE
COSTS OF THAT INSURANCE,  INCLUDING INTEREST AND ANY OTHER CHARGES THAT MAY
BE IMPOSED WITH THE PLACEMENT OF THE INSURANCE, UNTIL THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF
THE CANCELLATION OR EXPIRATION OF THE INSURANCE. THE COSTS OF THE INSURANCE
MAY BE  ADDED  TO THE  PRINCIPAL  AMOUNT  OF THE  LOANS  OWING  UNDER  THIS
AGREEMENT.  THE  COSTS OF THE  INSURANCE  MAY BE MORE  THAN THE COST OF THE
INSURANCE THE CREDIT PARTIES MAY BE ABLE TO OBTAIN ON THEIR OWN.

     (D) In the event of any taking of the Real Property or any part of the
Real Property,  in or by condemnation  or other eminent domain  proceedings
under  any  law,  general  or  special,  or  by  reason  of  the  temporary
requisition of the use or occupancy of the Credit Parties' Real Property or
any part of the Real  Property,  by any  governmental  authority,  civil or
military   (each,   a   "Taking"),   the  Credit   Parties  will  give  the
Administrative  Agent  prompt  notice  of such  Taking or  commencement  of
proceedings  for such  Taking.  All  proceeds  and any award or  payment in
respect of any Taking constitute proceeds of Asset Sales and are subject to
the provisions of Section 6.2(B)(i)(a).

Comply,  and cause each Subsidiary to comply, in all material respects with
all applicable laws (including  Environmental  Laws),  rules,  regulations,
decrees, orders,  judgments,  licenses and permits, except where failure to
comply could not  reasonably be expected to have a Material  Adverse Effect
and (b) pay, prior to delinquency, all taxes and other governmental charges
against it or any of their property, as well as claims of any kind that, if
unpaid,  might become a Lien on any of their  property;  provided that, the
foregoing shall not require the Credit Parties or any Subsidiary to pay any
such tax, claim or charge so long as it shall contest the validity  thereof
in good faith by appropriate proceedings and shall set aside on their books
adequate reserves with respect thereto in accordance with GAAP.

     10.5 Maintenance of Existence.  Maintain and preserve,  and cause each
Subsidiary to maintain and preserve,  (a) their existence and good standing
in the jurisdiction of their  organization and (b) their  qualification and
good  standing  as a foreign  corporation  in each  jurisdiction  where the
nature of their  business  makes such  qualification  necessary,  except in
those  instances  in which the failure to  maintain  such  existence  or be
qualified or in good  standing  could not  reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

          Borrowers and the Agents).

     (O)  Other.  Such  other  documents  as the  Agents or any  Lender may
          reasonably request.

     11.2  Conditions.  The  obligation of each Lender to amend and restate
the  Existing  Credit  Agreement  and the Existing  Loans  pursuant to this
Agreement and to make any  Revolving  Loan and of the Issuing Bank to issue
each  Letter of Credit  is  subject  to the  following  further  conditions
precedent that:

     (A)  Compliance  with  Warranties;  No Default;  No  Material  Adverse
          Changes.  Both before and after giving effect to any borrowing of
          a Loan and the  issuance  of any Letter of Credit  the  following
          statements shall be true and correct:

          (i)    the  representations  and warranties of the Credit Parties
                 set forth in this  Agreement and the other Loan  Documents
                 are true and  correct in all  material  respects  with the
                 same effect as if then made  (except to the extent  stated
                 to relate to a specific  earlier  date, in which case such
                 representations  and warranties are true and correct as of
                 such earlier date);

          (ii)   no  Default  or  Event  of  Default  has  occurred  and is
                 continuing; and

          (iii)  no event has occurred that could reasonably be expected to
                 have a Material Adverse Effect.

     (B)  Confirmatory  Certificate.  If  requested  by the  Agents  or any
          Lender,  the   Administrative   Agent  shall  have  received  (in
          sufficient   counterparts  to  provide  one  to  each  Lender)  a
          certificate  dated the date of such  requested  Loan or Letter of
          Credit  and  signed by a duly  authorized  representative  of the
          Borrowers as to the matters set out in Section  11.2(A) (it being
          understood that each request by the Borrowers for the making of a
          Loan or the  issuance  of a Letter of  Credit  shall be deemed to
          constitute  a  warranty  by the  Borrowers  that  the  conditions
          precedent  set forth in Section  11.2(A) will be satisfied at the
          time of the making of such Loan or the issuance of such Letter of
          Credit),  together with such other documents as the Agents or any
          Lender may reasonably request in support thereof.

     11.3  Postclosing  Deliveries.  The Credit  Parties  indicated  to the
Lenders and the Agents  prior to the Closing  Date that the Credit  Parties
would be unable to complete and deliver by the Closing  Date the  schedules
to this Agreement and various other  documents  required to be delivered on
the Closing Date. The Credit  Parties  requested the Lenders and the Agents
to  close  the  transaction  evidenced  by this  Agreement  and to take the
actions   contemplated   hereunder   notwithstanding  the  Credit  Parties'
noncompliance  with the  conditions  set forth in Section  11.1 through the
nondelivery  of such required  items.  The Lenders and the Agents agreed to
this request  provided that the Credit  Parties  execute and deliver to the
Lenders a Postclosing  Matters  Agreement dated the date hereof in form and
substance  satisfactory  to the Lenders  and the Agents  (the  "Postclosing
Matters Agreement").  Accordingly, the Credit Parties and the Lenders agree
that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
any other Loan Document,  the Existing  Credit  Agreement,  or any Existing
Loan Document:

     (A) The  Credit  Parties  may  deliver  the  items  set  forth  in the
Postclosing Matters Agreement in accordance with the delivery  requirements
set forth  therein,  and the Closing  Date will be deemed to have  occurred
upon the execution and delivery of the Postclosing Matters Agreement by the
Credit Parties and the  satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section
11.1 and 11.2 that are not subject to the Postclosing Matters Agreement.

     (B) With  respect to any  representation  and  warranty  of the Credit
Parties in this Agreement under which any exception or qualification may be
set forth on a schedule pursuant to the terms thereof,  no Default or Event
of  Default  will  occur or be  deemed to  occur,  nor shall the  condition
precedent set forth in Section 11.2(A)(i) fail to be satisfied or be deemed
to fail to be satisfied,  during the period from the Closing Date until the
date on which the relevant  schedule is required to be delivered  under the
Postclosing  Matters Agreement solely on account of such representation and
warranty  being untrue because of the Credit  Parties'  nondelivery of such
schedule.

              SECTION 12. EVENTS OF DEFAULT AND THEIR EFFECT.
                          ----------------------------------

          such Debt when due,  whether by acceleration or otherwise or (ii)
          accelerate  the  maturity  of such Debt or permit  the  holder or

          holders,  to cause such Debt to become due and  payable  prior to
          its expressed maturity.

     (C)  Bankruptcy;  Insolvency.  Any Credit Party or any Subsidiary of a

          of a trustee, receiver or other custodian for any Credit Party or
          any  Subsidiary  of a Credit  Party or any property  thereof,  or
          makes a general  assignment for the benefit of creditors;  or, in
          the  absence  of such  application,  consent or  acquiescence,  a
          trustee,  receiver or other custodian is appointed for any Credit
          Party or any  Subsidiary  of a Credit Party or for a  substantial
          part of the property of any thereof and is not discharged  within

          respect of any Credit Party or any  Subsidiary of a Credit Party,
          and if such case or  proceeding  is not  commenced  by any Credit
          Party or any such  Subsidiary of a Credit Party,  it is consented
          to or  acquiesced in by the Credit Party or such  Subsidiary,  or
          remains  for 45 days  undismissed;  or any  Credit  Party  or any

          agreement  or provision  set forth in any other Loan  Document or
          (ii)  failure by the Credit  Parties to comply with or to perform
          any other  covenant,  agreement  or  provision  set forth in this
          Agreement  (and not  otherwise  constituting  an Event of Default
          under any of the other  provisions  of this Section 12.1) and the
          continuance of such failure  described in this clause (ii) for 30
          days  after the  earlier  of (a) the date on which a  Responsible
          Officer of a Credit  Party first  learns of such  failure and (b)
          the date on which written notice thereof shall have been given to
          the Parent by the Administrative Agent or any Lender.

          made by any  Credit  Party in this  Agreement  or any other  Loan
          Document is breached or is false or  misleading  in any  material
          respect,  or  any  schedule,  certificate,  financial  statement,
          report,  notice or other writing furnished by any Credit Party to
          the  Agents or any  Lender  in  connection  herewith  is false or

          to  terminate a Pension  Plan if as a result of such  termination
          any Credit Party could be required to make a contribution to such
          Pension  Plan,  or could incur a liability or  obligation to such
          Pension Plan or the PBGC, (ii) a contribution failure occurs with

          withdrawal or partial  withdrawal  from a  Multiemployer  Pension

          behalf of the  Credit  Parties)  shall  contest in any manner the
          validity,  binding  nature or  enforceability  of any  Collateral

shall become immediately  obligated to deliver to the Administrative  Agent
cash collateral in an amount equal to 105% of the  outstanding  face amount
of all  Letters of Credit,  all  without  presentment,  demand,  protest or
notice of any kind;  and, if any other Event of Default  shall occur and be
continuing,  the Administrative Agent (upon written request of the Required
Lenders)  shall  declare  the  Commitments  (if they  have not  theretofore
terminated) to be terminated or declare all Notes and all other Obligations
to be due and payable or demand that the Borrowers  immediately  deliver to

Lenders, and the effect as an Event of Default of any other event described
in this Section 12 may be waived by the written concurrence of the Required
Lenders.  Any cash collateral  delivered under this Agreement and the other
Loan Documents shall be held by the Administrative Agent (without liability
for interest thereon) and applied to obligations arising in connection with
any drawing under a Letter of Credit.  After the  expiration or termination
of all  Letters of  Credit,  such cash  collateral  shall be applied by the
Administrative Agent to any remaining  obligations hereunder and any excess
shall be delivered to the Borrowers or as a court of competent jurisdiction
may elect.

Administrative  Agent or any Lender from the exercise of remedies hereunder
or under the other Loan Documents or under any other documents  relating to
this Agreement shall,  unless otherwise  required by the terms of the other

     (A)  first,  to the payment of all expenses (to the extent not paid by
          the  Borrowers)  incurred  by the  Administrative  Agent  and the
          Lenders  in  connection  with  the  exercise  of  such  remedies,
          including,  without limitation, all reasonable costs and expenses
          of collection,  attorneys'  fees, court costs and any foreclosure
          expenses;

     (B)  second,  to the payment pro rata of interest  then accrued on the
          outstanding Loans;

     (C)  third,  to the  payment  pro rata of any fees  then  accrued  and
          payable to the Administrative  Agent, any Letter of Credit Issuer
          or any Lender under this Agreement in respect of the Loans or the
          any Letter of Credit outstanding;

     (D)  fourth, to the payment pro rata of (i) the principal balance then
          owing on the outstanding  Loans,  (ii) the amounts then due under
          Rate Management  Obligations to creditors of the Borrowers or any
          Subsidiary,  subject to confirmation by the Administrative  Agent
          of any calculations of termination or other payment amounts being
          made in accordance with normal industry  practice,  and (iii) the
          Stated  Amount of any Letters of Credit  outstanding  (to be held
          and  applied  by the  Administrative  Agent as  security  for the
          reimbursement obligations in respect thereof);

     (E)  fifth,  to the payment to the Lenders of any amounts then accrued
          and  unpaid  under  Sections  7.6  and  8.1  hereof,  and if such
          proceeds are  insufficient  to pay such  amounts in full,  to the
          payment of such amounts pro rata;

     (F)  sixth,  to the payment pro rata of all other  amounts owed by the
          Borrowers to the  Administrative  Agent,  to any Letter of Credit
          Issuer or any  Lender  under  this  Agreement  or any other  Loan
          Document,   and  to  any  counterparties  under  Rate  Management
          Obligations  of the  Borrowers  or any  Subsidiary,  and if  such
          proceeds are  insufficient  to pay such  amounts in full,  to the
          payment of such amounts pro rata; and

     (G)  finally,  any remaining surplus after all of the Obligations have
          been paid in full,  to the  Borrowers or to  whomsoever  shall be
          lawfully entitled thereto.

                          SECTION 13. THE AGENTS.

Loan Document  unless it shall first receive such advice or  concurrence of
the  Required  Lenders  as it deems  appropriate  and,  if it so  requests,
confirmation  from  the  Lenders  of  their  obligation  to  indemnify  the
Administrative  Agent against any and all liability and expense that may be
incurred by it by reason of taking or  continuing  to take any such action.
The  Administrative  Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting,
or in  refraining  from  acting,  under  this  Agreement  or any other Loan
Document in  accordance  with a request or consent of the Required  Lenders
and such request and any action  taken or failure to act  pursuant  thereto
shall be binding upon all of the Lenders.

     13.5 Notice of Default.  The Administrative  Agent shall not be deemed
to have  knowledge or notice of the  occurrence  of any Default or Event of
Default  except  with  respect to  defaults  in the  payment of  principal,
interest and fees required to be paid to the  Administrative  Agent for the
account of the Lenders, unless the Administrative Agent shall have received
written notice from a Lender or the Borrowers  referring to this Agreement,
describing such Default or Event of Default and stating that such notice is
a "notice of default".  The Administrative  Agent will notify the Lender of
its receipt of any such notice  within a reasonable  time of such  receipt.
The  Administrative  Agent  shall  take such  action  with  respect to such
Default or Event of Default as may be requested by the Required  Lenders in
accordance   with  Section  12;   provided  that,   unless  and  until  the
Administrative  Agent has received  any such  request,  the  Administrative
Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from
taking such action,  with respect to such Default or Event of Default as it
shall deem advisable or in the best interest of the Lenders.

     13.6 Credit Decision. Each Lender acknowledges that the Administrative
Agent has not made any representation or warranty to it, and that no act by
the  Administrative  Agent  hereafter  taken,  including  any review of the
affairs of the Parent and its  Subsidiaries,  shall be deemed to constitute
any representation or warranty by the  Administrative  Agent to any Lender.
Each  Lender   represents  to  the   Administrative   Agent  that  it  has,
independently and without reliance upon the Administrative  Agent and based
on such documents and  information as it has deemed  appropriate,  made its
own  appraisal  of  and   investigation   into  the  business,   prospects,
operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of
the Parent and its  Subsidiaries,  and made its own  decision to enter into
this Agreement and to extend credit to the Borrowers hereunder. Each Lender
also represents that it will,  independently  and without reliance upon the
Administrative  Agent and based on such  documents  and  information  as it
shall  deem  appropriate  at the  time,  continue  to make  its own  credit
analysis,  appraisals  and  decisions in taking or not taking  action under
this   Agreement   and  the  other  Loan   Documents,   and  to  make  such
investigations  as it deems  necessary to inform itself as to the business,
prospects,   operations,   property,  financial  and  other  condition  and
creditworthiness  of the Parent and its  Subsidiaries.  Except for notices,
reports and other  documents  expressly  herein required to be furnished to
the Lenders by the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent shall not
have any duty or  responsibility  to provide  any Lender with any credit or
other information concerning the business, prospects, operations, property,
financial  or other  condition  or  creditworthiness  of the Parent and its
Subsidiaries that may come into the possession of the Administrative Agent.

     13.7 Indemnification. Regardless whether the transactions contemplated
hereby  are  consummated,  the  Lenders  shall  indemnify  upon  demand the
Administrative Agent and its directors,  officers, employees and agents (to
the extent not  reimbursed  by or on behalf of the  Borrowers  and  without
limiting the  obligation  of the  Borrowers  to do so), pro rata,  from and
against any and all Indemnified Liabilities; provided that, no Lender shall
be liable for any payment to the Administrative Agent of any portion of the
Indemnified   Liabilities   resulting   solely  from  such  Person's  gross
negligence or willful misconduct. Without limitation of the foregoing, each
Lender shall  reimburse  the Agents upon demand for their  ratable share of
any costs or out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable fees of attorneys
for the  Administrative  Agent  (including the allocable  costs of internal
legal services and all disbursements of internal  counsel)) incurred by the
Administrative  Agent  in  connection  with  the  preparation,   execution,
delivery,   modification,   amendment  or  enforcement   (whether   through
negotiations,  legal  proceedings  or  otherwise)  of,  or legal  advice in
respect of rights or responsibilities under, this Agreement, any other Loan
Document or any  document  contemplated  by or  referred to herein,  to the
extent that the Administrative Agent is not reimbursed for such expenses by
or on behalf of the Borrowers.  The  undertaking in this Section 13.7 shall
survive  repayment of the Loans,  cancellation of the Notes,  expiration or
termination  of the  Letters  of  Credit,  any  foreclosure  under,  or any
modification,  release  or  discharge  of,  any or  all  of the  Collateral
Documents,  any  termination  of  this  Agreement  and the  resignation  or
replacement of the Administrative Agent.

     13.8 Agents in Individual Capacity. (A) LaSalle and its Affiliates may
make loans to, issue letters of credit for the account of, accept  deposits
from,  acquire  equity  interests  in and  generally  engage in any kind of
banking, trust, financial advisory, underwriting or other business with the
Parent and its  Subsidiaries  and Affiliates as though LaSalle were not the
Administrative Agent or the Issuing Bank hereunder and without notice to or
consent of the  Lenders.  The Lenders  acknowledge  that,  pursuant to such
activities, LaSalle or its Affiliates may receive information regarding the
Parent and its Subsidiaries or their Affiliates (including information that
may be subject to  confidentiality  obligations  in favor of the Parent and
its  Subsidiaries) and acknowledge that the  Administrative  Agent shall be
under no obligation to provide such  information  to them.  With respect to
their Loans and Letters of Credit,  LaSalle and its  Affiliates  shall have
the same rights and powers under this Agreement as any other Lender and may
exercise the same as though  LaSalle were not the  Administrative  Agent or
the Issuing Bank, and the terms "Lender" and "Lenders"  include LaSalle and
its Affiliates, to the extent applicable, in their individual capacities.

     (B) NCB and its  Affiliates  may make loans to, accept  deposits from,
acquire  equity  interests in and generally  engage in any kind of banking,
trust,  financial advisory,  underwriting or other business with the Parent
and its  Subsidiaries and Affiliates as though NCB were not the Syndication
Agent  hereunder  and  without  notice to or  consent of the  Lenders.  The
Lenders  acknowledge  that,  pursuant  to  such  activities,   NCB  or  its
Affiliates   may  receive   information   regarding   the  Parent  and  its
Subsidiaries or their Affiliates (including information that may be subject
to confidentiality obligations in favor of the Parent and its Subsidiaries)
and acknowledge that the Syndication  Agent shall be under no obligation to
provide such  information to them. With respect to their Loans, NCB and its
Affiliates  shall have the same rights and powers  under this  Agreement as
any other  Lender  and may  exercise  the same as  though  NCB were not the
Syndication Agent, and the terms "Lender" and "Lenders" include NCB and its
Affiliates, to the extent applicable, in their individual capacities.

     13.9  Successor   Administrative  Agent;  Assignment  of  Agency.  The
Administrative  Agent may  resign  as  Administrative  Agent  upon 30 days'
notice to the Lenders and the Parent. If the  Administrative  Agent resigns
under this Agreement, the Required Lenders shall, with (so long as no Event
of Default exists) the consent of the Borrowers (which consent shall not be
unreasonably  withheld  or  delayed),  appoint  from  among  the  Lenders a
successor  agent for the Lenders.  If no successor agent is appointed prior
to the effective date of the resignation of the  Administrative  Agent, the
Administrative Agent may appoint, after consulting with the Lenders and the
Borrowers, a successor agent from among the Lenders. Upon the acceptance of
its  appointment as successor agent  hereunder,  such successor agent shall
succeed to all the rights, powers and duties of the retiring Administrative
Agent and the term "Administrative  Agent" shall mean such successor agent,
and the retiring  Administrative Agent's appointment,  powers and duties as
Administrative Agent shall be terminated. After any retiring Administrative
Agent's  resignation  hereunder as Administrative  Agent, the provisions of
this Section 13 and  Sections  15.5 and 15.15 shall inure to its benefit as
to  any  actions  taken  or  omitted  to  be  taken  by  it  while  it  was
Administrative  Agent  under  this  Agreement.  If no  successor  agent has
accepted  appointment as  Administrative  Agent by the date that is 30 days
following a retiring  Administrative  Agent's  notice of  resignation,  the
retiring  Administrative  Agent's resignation shall nevertheless  thereupon
become  effective  and the Lenders  shall  perform all of the duties of the
Administrative  Agent  hereunder  until such time,  if any, as the Required
Lenders appoint a successor agent as provided for above.

     13.10  Collateral  Matters.  The  Lenders  irrevocably  authorize  the
Administrative  Agent, at its option and in its discretion,  to release any
Lien granted to or held by the  Administrative  Agent under any  Collateral
Document (a) upon  termination of the  Commitments and repayment in full of
all Loans and all other  Obligations  of the  Borrowers  hereunder  and the
expiration  or  termination  of all  Letters  of Credit,  (b)  constituting
property sold or to be sold or disposed of as part of or in connection with
any  disposition  permitted  hereunder or (c) subject to Section  15.1,  if
approved,  authorized or ratified in writing by the Required Lenders.  Upon
request by the  Administrative  Agent at any time, the Lenders will confirm
in writing the Administrative Agent's authority to release particular types
or items of Collateral pursuant to this Section 13.10.

                           SECTION 14. GUARANTY.
                                       --------

     14.1 Guaranty.  To induce the Lenders to provide the credits described
herein and in consideration of benefits expected to accrue to the Borrowers
by reason of the Commitments and for other good and valuable consideration,
receipt   of  which  is  hereby   acknowledged,   each   Guarantor   hereby
unconditionally  and  irrevocably  guarantees  jointly and severally to the
Agents and the Lenders the due and punctual  payment and performance of all
present and future  indebtedness  of the Borrowers  evidenced by or arising
out of the Loan  Documents,  including,  but not  limited  to,  the due and
punctual  payment of principal  of and  interest on the Notes,  obligations
related  to the  Letter of Credit  Applications,  and the due and  punctual
payment of all Obligations or Rate Management  Obligations now or hereafter
owed by the Borrowers  under the Loan  Documents as and when the same shall
become due and payable,  whether at stated maturity, by acceleration,  upon
early  termination or otherwise,  according to the terms hereof and thereof
(the  "Guaranteed  Obligations").  In  case  of  failure  by the  Borrowers
punctually to pay any indebtedness or other  obligations  guaranteed hereby
(after giving effect to any applicable cure periods), each Guarantor hereby
unconditionally  agrees  jointly and  severally  to make such payment or to
cause such payment to be made  punctually as and when the same shall become
due and payable,  whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise,
and as if such payment were made by the Borrowers.

     14.2 Guaranty  Unconditional.  The  obligations of each Guarantor as a
guarantor  under this Section 14 shall be  unconditional  and absolute and,
without  limiting the generality of the  foregoing,  shall not be released,
discharged or otherwise affected by:

     (a)  any extension, renewal, settlement, compromise, waiver or release
          in respect of any  obligation  of the  Borrowers  or of any other
          guarantor  under this  Agreement or any other Loan Document or by
          operation of law or otherwise;

     (b)  any  modification or amendment of or supplement to this Agreement
          or any other Loan Document;

     (c)  any change in the  existence,  structure or ownership  of, or any
          insolvency,   bankruptcy,   reorganization   or   other   similar
          proceeding affecting,  the Borrowers, any other guarantor, or any
          of their respective assets, or any resulting release or discharge
          of any  obligation  of the  Borrowers  or of any other  guarantor
          contained in any Loan Document;

     (d)  the  existence  of any claim,  set-off or other  rights  that the
          Borrowers or any other guarantor may have at any time against the
          Agents, any Lender or any other Person, whether or not arising in
          connection herewith;

     (e)  any failure to assert,  or any  assertion of, any claim or demand
          or any  exercise  of,  or  failure  to  exercise,  any  rights or
          remedies against the Borrowers,  any other guarantor or any other
          Person or Real Property;

     (f)  any  application  of any  sums by  whomsoever  paid or  howsoever
          realized to any obligation of the  Borrowers,  regardless of what
          obligations of the Borrowers remain unpaid;

     (g)  any  invalidity  or  unenforceability  relating to or against the
          Borrowers or any other guarantor for any reason of this Agreement
          or of any other Loan Document or any provision of applicable  law
          or regulation purporting to prohibit the payment by the Borrowers
          or any other  guarantor  of the  principal  of or interest on any
          Note or any other amount payable under the Loan Documents; or

     (h)  any  other  act or  omission  to act or  delay of any kind by the
          Agents,  any Lender or any other Person or any other circumstance
          whatsoever that might,  but for the provisions of this paragraph,
          constitute a legal or equitable  discharge of the  obligations of
          any Guarantor under this Section 14.

     14.3  Discharge  Only Upon Payment in Full;  Reinstatement  in Certain
Circumstances.  Each  Guarantor's  obligations  under this Section 14 shall
remain in full force and effect until the Commitments  are terminated,  all
Letters of Credit have  expired,  and the  principal of and interest on the
Notes and all other amounts  payable by the Borrowers  under this Agreement
and all other Loan  Documents  shall have been paid in full. If at any time
any payment of the principal of or interest on any Note or any other amount
payable by the Borrowers  under the Loan  Documents is rescinded or must be
otherwise   restored  or  returned  upon  the  insolvency,   bankruptcy  or
reorganization  of the Borrowers or of any  guarantor,  or otherwise,  each
Guarantor's  obligations under this Section 14 with respect to such payment
shall be  reinstated at such time as though such payment had become due but
had not been made at such time.

     14.4  Subrogation.  Each  Guarantor  agrees it will not  exercise  any
rights  that it may  acquire  by way of  subrogation  by any  payment  made
hereunder,  or otherwise,  until all the Guaranteed  Obligations shall have
been paid in full  subsequent to the termination of all the Commitments and
expiration or  defeasance  in full of all Letters of Credit.  If any amount
shall be paid to a Guarantor on account of such  subrogation  rights at any
time  prior  to the  later  of (a) the  payment  in full of the  Guaranteed
Obligations  and all other amounts  payable by the Borrowers  hereunder and
the other Loan  Documents and (b) the  termination of the  Commitments  and
expiration of all Letters of Credit, such amount shall be held in trust for
the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders and shall forthwith
be paid to the  Administrative  Agent for the  benefit of the Lenders or be
credited and applied upon the Guaranteed  Obligations,  whether  matured or
unmatured, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

     14.5 Waivers.  Each Guarantor  irrevocably  waives acceptance  hereof,
presentment,  demand,  protest and any notice not provided  for herein,  as
well as any requirement that at any time any action be taken by the Agents,
any Lender or any other Person against the Borrowers,  another guarantor or
any other Person.

     14.6 Stay of Acceleration.  If acceleration of the time for payment of
any amount payable by the Borrowers  under this Agreement or any other Loan
Document is stayed upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of the
Borrowers,  all such amounts  otherwise  subject to acceleration  under the
terms of this  Agreement or the other Loan Documents  shall  nonetheless be
payable  jointly and  severally by the  Guarantors  hereunder  forthwith on
demand by the  Administrative  Agent made at the  request  of the  Required
Lenders.

     14.7 General Limitation on Guarantee Obligations.  Each Guarantor, the
Agents and each other Lender hereby confirm that it is the intention of all
such Persons that this Guaranty and the Obligations of each Guarantor under
this  Section 14 not  constitute a fraudulent  transfer or  conveyance  for
purposes of Bankruptcy Law (as hereinafter defined), the Uniform Fraudulent
Conveyance Act, the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act or any similar foreign,
federal  or state law to the extent  applicable  to this  Guaranty  and the
Obligations  of each  Guarantor  hereunder.  To  effectuate  the  foregoing
intention,  the Agents, the other Lenders,  and the Guarantors hereby agree
that the Guaranteed  Obligations  of each Guarantor  under this Guaranty at
any time  shall be  limited  to the  maximum  amount as will  result in the
Guaranteed   Obligations  of  such   Guarantor   under  this  Guaranty  not
constituting  a fraudulent  transfer or  conveyance.  For purposes  hereof,
"Bankruptcy  Law" means any  proceeding  of the type referred to in Section
12.1(C) of this  Agreement or Title 11 of the United  States  Code,  or any
similar foreign, federal or state law for the relief of debtors.

                           SECTION 15. GENERAL.
                                       -------

     15.1 Waiver;  Amendments.  No delay on the part of the  Administrative
Agent,  any  Lender or any other  holder of a Note in the  exercise  of any
right,  power or remedy shall  operate as a waiver  thereof,  nor shall any
single or partial  exercise  by any of them of any  right,  power or remedy
preclude other or further  exercise  thereof,  or the exercise of any other
right, power or remedy. No amendment, modification or waiver of, or consent
with respect to, any provision of this  Agreement or the Notes shall in any
event be  effective  unless  the same  shall be in  writing  and signed and
delivered by Lenders  having an aggregate  Percentage  of not less than the
aggregate  Percentage  expressly designated herein with respect thereto or,
in the absence of such designation as to any provision of this Agreement or
the  Notes,  by  the  Required  Lenders,   and  then  any  such  amendment,
modification,  waiver or consent  shall be  effective  only in the specific
instance  and for the  specific  purpose  for which  given.  No  amendment,
modification,  waiver or consent shall change the  Percentage of any Lender
without the consent of such Lender. No amendment,  modification,  waiver or
consent  shall (a) extend or increase  the amount of the  Commitments,  (b)
extend the  scheduled  date for payment of any  principal of or interest on
the  Loans or any fees  payable  hereunder;  it being  understood  that any
mandatory  prepayment  under  Section  6.2(B) may be waived by the Required
Lenders,  (c) reduce the principal amount of any Loan, the rate of interest
thereon or any fees payable hereunder, (d) release all or substantially all
of the Collateral  granted under the Collateral  Documents,  (e) reduce the
aggregate Percentage required to effect an amendment,  modification, waiver
or consent or (f) release any Guarantor  from such  Guarantor's  Guaranteed
Obligations  without,  in  each  case,  the  consent  of  all  Lenders.  No
provisions of Section 13 or other provision of this Agreement affecting the
Administrative Agent in its capacity as such shall be amended,  modified or
waived  without the consent of the  Administrative  Agent.  No provision of
this Agreement  relating to the rights or duties of the Issuing Bank in its
capacity as such shall be amended,  modified or waived  without the consent
of the Issuing Bank.

     15.2 Confirmations. The Borrowers and each holder of a Note agree from
time to time,  upon  written  request  received  by it from the  other,  to
confirm to the other in writing (with a copy of each such  confirmation  to

officer or  employee of the  Borrowers,  and the  Borrowers  shall hold the
Administrative  Agent and each other Lender harmless from any loss, cost or
expense resulting from any such reliance.

     15.4  Computations.  Where  the  character  or  amount of any asset or
liability or item of income or expense is required to be determined, or any

Percentage)  of any such costs and  expenses  of the Agents not paid by the
Borrowers.  In addition, the Borrowers agree to pay, and to save the Agents
and the Lenders  harmless  from all  liability  for, (x) any stamp or other

     (A)  Assignments.  As long as no Event of Default has  occurred and is
continuing,  any Lender may, with the prior written consents of the Parent,
the Issuing Bank and the Administrative  Agent (which consents shall not be
unreasonably  delayed or withheld and, in any event,  shall not be required
for an assignment by a Lender to one of its Affiliates), at any time assign
and delegate to one or more  commercial  banks or other Persons (any Person
to whom such an assignment and delegation is to be made being herein called
an  "Assignee"),  all or any fraction of such Lender's Loans and Commitment

aggregate  amount  equal to the lesser of (i) the  amount of the  assigning
Lender's  Percentage  of the  Revolving  Commitment  Amount plus the unpaid
balance of such Lender's Term Loan and (ii)  $5,000,000;  provided that (a)
no assignment  and  delegation may be made to any Person if, at the time of
such assignment and delegation, the Borrowers would be obligated to pay any
greater  amount  under  Section 7.6 or Section 8 to the  Assignee  than the
Borrowers  are then  obligated  to pay to the  assigning  Lender under such
Sections (and if any assignment is made in violation of the foregoing,  the
Borrowers will not be required to pay the incremental  amounts) and (b) the
Borrowers  and the Agents  shall be entitled to continue to deal solely and
directly with such Lender in connection  with the interests so assigned and
delegated  to an  Assignee  until  the  date  when  all  of  the  following
conditions shall have been met:

          assigning Lender and the Assignee;

     (2)  the  assigning  Lender and the Assignee  shall have  executed and
          delivered  to the  Borrowers  and  the  Administrative  Agent  an
          assignment  agreement  substantially in the form of Exhibit G (an

          be delivered  thereunder,  which Assignment  Agreement shall have
          been accepted by the Administrative Agent; and

     (3)  the assigning Lender or the Assignee has paid the  Administrative
          Agent a processing fee of $3,500;  provided  that,  such fee will

          Lender.

From and after the date on which the conditions  described  above have been
met, (x) such Assignee shall be deemed automatically to have become a party
hereto and, to the extent that rights and  obligations  hereunder have been
assigned  and  delegated  to such  Assignee  pursuant  to  such  Assignment
Agreement,  shall have the rights and obligations of a Lender hereunder and
(y) the  assigning  Lender,  to the  extent  that  rights  and  obligations
hereunder  have  been  assigned  and  delegated  by  it  pursuant  to  such
Assignment  Agreement,  shall be released from its  obligations  hereunder.
Within  five  Business  Days  after  effectiveness  of any  assignment  and
delegation,  the Borrowers shall execute and deliver to the  Administrative
Agent (for delivery to the Assignee and the Assignor,  as applicable) a new
Note in the principal amount of the Assignee's  Percentage of the Revolving
Commitment  Amount plus the principal  amount of the  Assignee's  Term Loan
and,  if the  assigning  Lender has  retained  a  Commitment  hereunder,  a
replacement Note in the principal amount of the Percentage of the Revolving
Commitment  Amount  retained by the  assigning  Lender  plus the  principal
amount of the Term Loan retained by the  assigning  Lender (such Note to be
in exchange for, but not in payment of, the  predecessor  Note held by such
assigning Lender). Each such Note shall be dated the effective date of such
assignment.   The  assigning   Lender  shall  mark  the  predecessor   Note
"exchanged" and deliver it to the Borrowers.  Accrued interest on that part
of the  predecessor  Note being  assigned  shall be paid as provided in the
Assignment  Agreement.  Accrued  interest  and  fees  on  that  part of the
predecessor Note not being assigned shall be paid to the assigning  Lender.
Accrued  interest  and accrued fees shall be paid at the same time or times
provided  in the  predecessor  Note and in this  Agreement.  Any  attempted
assignment and delegation not made in accordance  with this Section 15.8(A)
shall be null and void.  Notwithstanding  the foregoing  provisions of this
Section 15.8(A) or any other provision of this Agreement, any Lender may at
any time  assign all or any  portion of its Loans and its Note to a Federal
Reserve Bank (but no such  assignment  shall release any Lender from any of
its obligations hereunder).

     (B)  Participations.  Any  Lender  may at any time sell to one or more
commercial banks or other Persons participating interests in any Loan owing
to such  Lender,  the Note  held by such  Lender,  the  Commitment  of such
Lender, the direct or indirect participation interest of such Lender in any
Letter of Credit or any other interest of such Lender hereunder (any Person
purchasing   any  such   participating   interest  being  herein  called  a
"Participant").  In the  event  of a sale by a  Lender  of a  participating
interest to a  Participant,  (i) such Lender shall remain the holder of its
Note for all purposes of this Agreement,  (ii) the Borrowers and the Agents
shall  continue to deal solely and directly  with such Lender in connection
with such Lender's rights and  obligations  hereunder and (iii) all amounts
payable by the Borrowers shall be determined as if such Lender had not sold
such   participation  and  shall  be  paid  directly  to  such  Lender.  No
Participant  other than a  Participant  that is an  Affiliate of the Lender
shall have any direct or  indirect  voting  rights  hereunder  except  with
respect to any of the events  described  in the fourth  sentence of Section
15.1 and for increases in the Commitment of the participating Lender if the
Participant's commitment would be thereby increased.  Each Lender agrees to
incorporate  the   requirements   of  the  preceding   sentence  into  each
participation  agreement that such Lender enters into with any Participant.
The Borrowers  agree that if amounts  outstanding  under this Agreement and
the Notes are due and payable (as a result of  acceleration  or otherwise),
each Participant  shall be deemed to have the right of setoff in respect of
its participating interest in amounts owing under this Agreement,  any Note
and with  respect  to any  Letter of  Credit  to the same  extent as if the
amount of its participating  interest were owing directly to it as a Lender
under this  Agreement  or such Note;  provided  that,  such right of setoff
shall be subject to the  obligation of each  Participant  to share with the
Lenders, and the Lenders agree to share with each Participant,  as provided
in Section 7.5. The  Borrowers  also agree that each  Participant  shall be
entitled  to the  benefits  of  Section  7.6 and  Section 8 as if it were a
Lender   (provided   that,  no   Participant   shall  receive  any  greater
compensation pursuant to Section 7.6 or Section 8 than would have been paid
to the participating Lender if no participation had been sold).

     15.9 Entire  Agreement.  This  Agreement and the other Loan  Documents
sets  forth the  entire  agreement  of the  Borrowers,  the  Agents and the
Lenders with respect to the matters  addressed  in this  Agreement  and the
other Loan Documents. This Agreement and the other Loan Documents supersede
all  prior  written  or oral  agreements,  instruments  or other  documents
respecting such matters.

     15.10  Amendment and  Restatement of Existing  Credit  Agreement.  The
Borrowers,  the Agents and the Lenders  agree that,  upon the execution and
delivery by each of the parties hereto of this  Agreement and  satisfaction
of the  conditions  set forth in Section 11.1,  the terms and provisions of
the Existing Credit  Agreement shall be and hereby are amended,  superseded
and  restated  in  their  entirety  by the  terms  and  provision  of  this
Agreement.  It is the intention of the parties to this  Agreement that this
Agreement not constitute a novation of the  obligations  under the Existing
Credit Agreement and shall not operate as a novation,  waiver of any right,
power or remedy of the parties  thereto nor  constitute  an  amendment or a
waiver  of any  provision  of the Loan  Documents  or the  Existing  Credit
Agreement, except as expressly set forth herein and shall be limited to the
particular  instance  expressly  set  forth  herein.  All  loans  made  and
obligations   incurred  under  the  Existing  Credit   Agreement  that  are
outstanding  on the  effective  date  hereof  shall  continue  as loans and
obligations  under (and shall be governed by the terms of) this  Agreement.
From and after the effective  date hereof,  the Existing  Credit  Agreement
shall  be  amended  and  restated  hereby  and  all  references  herein  to
"hereunder",  "hereof",  or words of like import and all  references in any
other Loan Document to the "Credit Agreement" or words of like import shall
mean and be a reference  to the  Existing  Credit  Agreement as amended and
restated hereby.

     15.11  Affirmation  and  Continued   Effectiveness  of  Existing  Loan
Documents,  Collateral  Documents and Liens. The Credit Parties acknowledge
and agree that each Existing Loan Document that is not expressly superceded
by this Agreement and each  Collateral  Document  remains in full force and
effect both before and after the Closing Date and the effectiveness of this
Agreement. The Credit Parties further acknowledge and agree that all Liens,
mortgages and security interests granted under the Collateral  Documents to
secure the Credit  Parties  obligations  to the Lenders  under the Existing
Credit  Agreement  remain in full force and effect  and  constitute  valid,
perfected,  and  subsisting  Liens  securing  the  Obligations  under  this
Agreement,  and that such Liens, mortgages, and security interests have the
same effect and priority  against the Credit  Parties and all third parties
as existed  immediately prior to the effectiveness of this Agreement and as
set forth in Section 9.26.

     15.12  GOVERNING LAW. THIS AGREEMENT AND EACH NOTE SHALL BE A CONTRACT
MADE  UNDER  AND  GOVERNED  BY THE LAW OF THE STATE OF  ILLINOIS.  Whenever
possible each  provision of this  Agreement  shall be  interpreted  in such
manner  as to be  effective  and valid  under  applicable  law,  but if any
provision  of this  Agreement  shall  be  prohibited  by or  invalid  under
applicable  law, such provision  shall be ineffective to the extent of such
prohibition  or  invalidity,  without  invalidating  the  remainder of such
provision or the remaining provisions of this Agreement. All Obligations of
the Borrowers and rights of the Agents, the Lenders and any other holder of
a Note expressed  herein or in any other Loan Document shall be in addition
to and not in limitation of those provided by applicable law.

     15.13  Counterparts.  This  Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts and by the different  parties hereto on separate  counterparts
and each such counterpart  shall be deemed to be an original,  but all such
counterparts shall together constitute but one and the same Agreement.

     15.14 Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall be binding upon the
Borrowers,  the Lenders and the Agents and their respective  successors and
assigns,  and shall inure to the benefit of the Borrowers,  the Lenders and
the Agents and the successors and assigns of the Lenders and the Agents.

     15.15  Indemnification by the Credit Parties.  (A) In consideration of
the execution and delivery of this  Agreement by the Agents and the Lenders
and the agreement to extend the Commitments provided hereunder,  the Credit
Parties  hereby agree to indemnify,  exonerate and hold the  Administrative
Agent, the Syndication  Agent,  each Lender and each Issuing Bank, and each
of their respective officers, directors,  employees,  Affiliates,  trustees
and agents (each a "Lender  Party") free and harmless  from and against any
and all actions, causes of action, suits, losses, liabilities,  damages and
related  expenses,  including  reasonable  attorneys'  fees and charges and
allocated   costs  of  staff  counsel   (collectively,   the   "Indemnified
Liabilities"),  incurred  by the Lender  Parties or any of them as a result
of, or arising  out of, or in any way  relating  to (i) any  tender  offer,
merger,  purchase of stock, purchase of assets or other similar transaction
financed  or  proposed  to be  financed  in whole or in part,  directly  or
indirectly,  with the  proceeds  of any of the  Loans,  (ii) the use of the
proceeds  of the  Loans  or  issuance  of  Letters  of  Credit,  (iii)  the
execution,  delivery,  performance  or enforcement of this Agreement or any
other Loan Document by any of the Lender Parties or the consummation of the
transactions  contemplated  thereby,  (iv)  the  use,  handling,   release,
emission, discharge, transportation,  storage, treatment or disposal of any
Hazardous  Substance  at any real  property  owned or leased by the  Credit
Parties or any Subsidiary,  except to the extent that Hazardous  Substances
are initially used, handled, released,  emitted,  discharged,  transported,
stored,   treated  or  disposed  of  subsequent  to  (a)  full  payment  or
satisfaction  of the  Obligations  under this  Agreement and the other Loan
Documents or (b) a foreclosure by the Administrative Agent or any Lender of
the Mortgage  with respect to such real  property or  possession  otherwise
being  taken  by the  Administrative  Agent  or any  Lender  of  such  real
property, except to the extent that such use, handling,  release, emission,
discharge, transportation,  storage, treatment or disposal is caused by and
act or omission of the Credit Parties or any Subsidiary,  (v) any violation
of any  Environmental  Laws with respect to conditions at any real property
owned or leased by the Credit  Parties or any  Subsidiary or the operations
conducted  thereon,  (vi) the  investigation,  cleanup  or  remediation  of
offsite  locations to the extent that the Credit  Parties or any Subsidiary
or their respective predecessors are alleged to have directly or indirectly
disposed  of  Hazardous   Substances   or  (vii)  any  claim,   litigation,
investigation  or proceeding  relating to any of the foregoing,  whether or
not a Lender  Party is a party  thereto,  except  for any such  Indemnified
Liabilities  arising on account of any such Lender Party's gross negligence
or willful misconduct.  If and to the extent that the foregoing undertaking
may be  unenforceable  for any reason,  the Credit  Parties hereby agree to
make the maximum  contribution  to the payment and  satisfaction of each of
the  Indemnified  Liabilities  that is permissible  under  applicable  law.
Nothing set forth above shall be construed to relieve any Lender Party from
any obligation it may have under this Agreement.

     (B) If any action,  suit or proceeding is commenced against any Lender
Party  that such  Lender  Party  believes  is  subject  to  indemnification
hereunder,  such Lender Party shall  promptly  notify the Parent (who shall
receive such notice on behalf of all Credit Parties), and such Lender Party
may,  and if  requested  by the Parent  (on  behalf of all Credit  Parties)
shall,  in good faith,  contest the validity,  applicability  and amount of
such action, suit or proceeding with counsel selected by such Lender Party,
and  shall  permit  the  Parent  (on  behalf  of  all  Credit  Parties)  to
participate in such contest,  subject to the overall  control and direction
of such Lender Party and its counsel.  In addition,  in connection with the
defense of any action,  suit or  proceeding  covered by this Section  15.15
against  more than one  Lender  Party,  all such  Lender  Parties  shall be
represented  by the same legal  counsel  selected by such  Lender  Parties;
provided  that,  if  such  legal  counsel  determines  in good  faith  that
representing all such Lender Parties would or could result in a conflict of
interest  under the laws or  ethical  principles  applicable  to such legal
counsel or that a defense or  counterclaim  is available  to an  Indemnitee
that is not  available  to all  such  Lender  Parties,  then to the  extent
reasonably  necessary  to avoid such a conflict  of  interest  or to permit
unqualified  assertion of such defense or  counterclaim,  each Lender Party
shall be entitled to separate representation by a legal counsel selected by
that Lender Party.

     (C) The Credit Parties  jointly and severally  agree that upon written
notice by any Lender Party of the  incurrence  or sufferance by such Lender
Party of any  Indemnifiable  Liabilities,  the Credit  Parties will pay, on
demand,  all  Indemnifiable  Liabilities,  from  time to time  incurred  or
suffered by such Lender  Party.  Each Lender  Party  agrees to use its best
efforts  promptly to notify the Parent (on behalf of all Credit Parties) of
any written assertion of any Indemnifiable Liabilities of which such Lender
Party has actual knowledge.

     (D) In addition,  and without limitation of the foregoing,  the Credit
Parties jointly and severally agree to pay,  indemnify and hold each Lender
Party harmless from and against any loss, costs,  damages and expenses that
such Lender Party may suffer,  expend or incur in consequence of or growing
out of any material  misrepresentation by a Credit Party in this Agreement,
the Loan Documents or any agreement or instrument  contemplated  hereby, or
in any statement or writing  contemplated by or made or delivered  pursuant
to or in connection with this Agreement.

     (E) To the extent  permitted by  applicable  law,  the Credit  Parties
shall not assert,  and hereby waive, any claim against any Lender Party, on
any theory of liability, for special,  indirect,  consequential or punitive
damages  (as  opposed  to  direct  or actual  damages)  arising  out of, in
connection  with, or as a result of, this Agreement,  the Loan Documents or
any  agreement or  instrument  contemplated  hereby,  any Loan or Letter of
Credit of the use of the proceeds thereof.

     (F) All  obligations  provided for in this Section  15.15 shall remain
operative and in full force and effect  regardless of the  consummation  of
the  transactions  contemplated  hereby,  the  repayment of any Loans,  the
expiration of the Commitments, cancellation of the Notes, the expiration or
termination  of the  Letters  of  Credit,  any  foreclosure  under,  or any
modification,  release  or  discharge  of any  or  all  of  the  Collateral
Documents and any termination of this Agreement.

     15.16 Nonliability of Lenders.  The relationship between the Borrowers
on the one hand and the  Lenders  and the Agents on the other hand shall be
solely that of borrower and lender. Neither the Agents nor any Lender shall
have any fiduciary responsibility to the Borrowers.  Neither the Agents nor
any Lender  undertakes  any  responsibility  to the  Borrowers to review or
inform  the  Borrowers  of any matter in  connection  with any phase of any
Borrower's  business or  operations.  The Borrowers  agree that neither the
Agents  nor any Lender  shall  have  liability  to the  Borrowers  (whether
sounding  in tort,  contract  or  otherwise)  for  losses  suffered  by the
Borrowers in connection with,  arising out of, or in any way related to the
transactions  contemplated  and the  relationship  established  by the Loan
Documents, or any act, omission or event occurring in connection therewith,
unless it is  determined in a final  non-appealable  judgment by a court of
competent  jurisdiction that such losses resulted from the gross negligence
or willful  misconduct of the party from which recovery is sought.  Neither
the Agents nor any Lender shall have any liability with respect to, and the
Borrowers  hereby  waive,  release and agree not to sue for,  any  special,
indirect or  consequential  damages suffered by the Borrowers in connection
with,  arising out of, or in any way related to the Loan  Documents  or the
transactions contemplated thereby.

     15.17 FORUM  SELECTION  AND CONSENT TO  JURISDICTION.  ANY  LITIGATION
BASED  HEREON,  OR  ARISING  OUT OF,  UNDER,  OR IN  CONNECTION  WITH  THIS
AGREEMENT  OR ANY OTHER  LOAN  DOCUMENT,  SHALL BE BROUGHT  AND  MAINTAINED
EXCLUSIVELY  IN THE COURTS OF THE STATE OF ILLINOIS OR IN THE UNITED STATES
DISTRICT  COURT FOR THE NORTHERN  DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS;  PROVIDED THAT, ANY
SUIT SEEKING  ENFORCEMENT  AGAINST ANY  COLLATERAL OR OTHER PROPERTY MAY BE
BROUGHT,  AT THE AGENTS' OPTION,  IN THE COURTS OF ANY  JURISDICTION  WHERE
SUCH COLLATERAL OR OTHER PROPERTY MAY BE FOUND. THE BORROWERS EXPRESSLY AND
IRREVOCABLY  SUBMIT  TO THE  JURISDICTION  OF THE  COURTS  OF THE  STATE OF
ILLINOIS AND OF THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN  DISTRICT

BORROWERS  FURTHER  IRREVOCABLY  CONSENT  TO  THE  SERVICE  OF  PROCESS  BY
REGISTERED MAIL, POSTAGE PREPAID,  OR BY PERSONAL SERVICE WITHIN OR WITHOUT
THE STATE OF ILLINOIS.  THE BORROWERS  EXPRESSLY AND IRREVOCABLY  WAIVE, TO
THE FULLEST  EXTENT  PERMITTED  BY LAW,  ANY  OBJECTION  THAT IT MAY NOW OR
HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE LAYING OF VENUE OF ANY SUCH LITIGATION BROUGHT IN ANY
SUCH COURT  REFERRED  TO ABOVE AND ANY CLAIM THAT ANY SUCH  LITIGATION  HAS
BEEN BROUGHT IN AN  INCONVENIENT  FORUM.  TO THE EXTENT THAT THE  BORROWERS
HAVE OR HEREAFTER MAY ACQUIRE ANY IMMUNITY FROM  JURISDICTION  OF ANY COURT
OR FROM ANY LEGAL PROCESS  (WHETHER  THROUGH SERVICE OR NOTICE,  ATTACHMENT
PRIOR TO  JUDGMENT,  ATTACHMENT  IN AID OF  EXECUTION  OR  OTHERWISE)  WITH
RESPECT TO THEMSELVES OR THEIR PROPERTY,  THE BORROWERS HEREBY  IRREVOCABLY
WAIVE SUCH IMMUNITY IN RESPECT OF THEIR  OBLIGATIONS  UNDER THIS  AGREEMENT
AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS.

     15.18 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH OF THE BORROWERS, THE AGENTS AND EACH
LENDER  WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION OR  PROCEEDING TO
ENFORCE OR DEFEND ANY RIGHTS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, ANY NOTE, ANY OTHER LOAN
DOCUMENT AND ANY AMENDMENT,  INSTRUMENT, DOCUMENT OR AGREEMENT DELIVERED OR
THAT MAY IN THE FUTURE BE DELIVERED IN CONNECTION  HEREWITH OR THEREWITH OR
ARISING FROM ANY BANKING  RELATIONSHIP  EXISTING IN CONNECTION  WITH ANY OF
THE FOREGOING, AND AGREES THAT ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING SHALL BE TRIED
BEFORE A COURT AND NOT BEFORE A JURY.

     15.19  Confidentiality.  Each  Agent  and each  Lender  agrees to keep
confidential  all  nonpublic  information  obtained  by it pursuant to this
Agreement and the other Loan  Documents in accordance  with such Agent's or
such  Lender's  customary  practices  for  treatment  of  its  confidential
information and agrees that it will only use such information in connection
with the  transactions  contemplated by this Agreement and not disclose any
of such  information  other  than  (a) to the  Administrative  Agent  or an
Affiliate  of  the  Administrative  Agent,  the  Syndication  Agent  or  an
Affiliate of the  Syndication  Agent or any other Lender or an Affiliate of
any Lender,  (b) to such  Agent's or Lender's  employees,  representatives,
directors,  attorneys,  auditors, agents, professional advisors or trustees
or to any direct or indirect contractual counterparty in swap agreements or
such contractual  counterparty's  professional  advisor,  (c) to the extent
such  information  becomes  publicly  available other than as a result of a
breach of this Section  15.19 or becomes  available to such Agent or Lender
on a  nonconfidential  basis from a source other than a Credit Party or any
Affiliate  of a Credit  Party,  (d)  upon  the  request  or  demand  of any
Governmental  Authority,  (e) to the extent  disclosure  is required by law
(including  applicable securities laws),  regulation,  subpoena or judicial
order or process  (provided that, notice of such requirement or order shall
be  promptly  furnished  to  the  Parent  unless  such  notice  is  legally
prohibited)  or  requested  or required by bank,  securities,  insurance or
investment company  regulations or auditors or any  administrative  body or
commission  to whose  jurisdiction  such Lender may be subject,  (f) to the
National Association of Insurance Commissioners or any similar organization
or any  nationally  recognized  rating  agency to the  extent  required  in
connection with any rating to be assigned to such Lender,  (g) to Assignees
or  Participants or prospective  Assignees or Participants  who agree to be
bound by the provisions of this Section 15.19,  (h) to the extent  required
in connection with any litigation or similar  proceeding between any Credit
Party and any Agent or Lender with  respect to the Loans or this  Agreement
and the other Loan  Documents,  (i) in connection  with the exercise of any
remedy hereunder or under any other Loan Document, or (j) with the Parent's
prior written consent.

     15.20 Termination;  Release of Guarantees and Collateral. At such time
as the Commitments  are  terminated,  all Letters of Credit have expired or
have been cash  collateralized  and the principal and interest on the Notes
and all other amounts payable by the Borrowers under this Agreement and all
other Loan Documents  shall have been paid in full,  this  Agreement  shall
terminate   (except  for  provisions  that  by  their  terms  survive  such
termination). Upon any such termination, the Administrative Agent shall, at
the expense of the  Borrowers,  take such  actions as are  appropriate  and
reasonably requested by the Borrowers in connection therewith.
