Agreement, the Lender agrees to issue Letters of Credit pursuant to Article 3,
at any time and from time to time from and including the Closing Date to but
excluding the Revolving Credit Termination Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
no Letter of Credit shall be issued if immediately thereafter (i) the principal
amount of the Revolving Credit Loans outstanding plus the L/C Obligations shall

Credit Commitment.

<PAGE>

             (d) Types of Loans. The Loans may be outstanding as Prime Rate
Loans or Libor Rate Loans (each a "Type of Loan"). Each Type of Loan of Lender
shall be made and maintained at Lender's Lending Office for such Type of Loan.

Section 2.02 The Note. The Revolving Credit Loans of Lender shall be evidenced
by a single Revolving Credit Note in favor of Lender.

Section 2.03 Purpose. The Borrower shall use the proceeds of the Revolving
Credit Loans solely for (a) repayment of all outstanding indebtedness under the

Schedule 8.01(e), (b) general corporate purposes including working capital and
to issue letters of credit as provided hereunder and (c) for other general

proceeds shall not be used for the purpose, whether direct, indirect, immediate,
incidental or ultimate, of (i) prepayment of the principal amount, in whole or
in part, of the Senior Subordinated Notes or (ii) buying or carrying "margin
stock" within the meaning of Regulation U, or extending credit to others for the
purpose of purchasing or carrying any margin stock.

Section 2.04 Borrowing Procedures. Borrower shall give Lender notice of each
borrowing to be made, and each Letter of Credit to be issued, hereunder as

Reductions. The Borrower shall have the right to make prepayments of principal
without penalty or premium (other than amounts payable in accordance with
Article IV (if any)), or to convert one Type of Loan into another Type of Loan,
or to reduce the amount of the Revolving Credit Commitment, at any time or from
time to time; provided that (a) Borrower shall give Lender notice of each such
prepayment, conversion or reduction as provided in Section 2.08; (b) Libor Rate
Loans may be prepaid or converted only on the last day of an Interest Period for
such Loans unless the Borrower agrees to provide to Lender compensation in
accordance with Section 4.05; and (c) any reduction of the Revolving Credit
Commitment shall be permanent, shall be in multiples of $1,000,000 and shall be
subject to Section 2.01(c).

Section 2.06 Mandatory Prepayments. Commitments Exceeded. If at any time the
aggregate principal amount of all Revolving Credit Loans outstanding plus the
L/C Obligations shall exceed the Revolving Credit Commitment at such time, the
Borrower shall repay the Lender forthwith such amounts as may be necessary to
eliminate such excess (and if prepayment on such date would cause Borrower to
incur costs pursuant to Section 4.05, the Borrower shall deposit with the
Lender, until such prepayment can be made or such additional costs avoided,
sufficient cash collateral (which cash collateral shall be held by the Lender
for the benefit of the Borrower in an interest bearing account) to cover such
excess which shall be withdrawn by the Lender upon the expiration of the
applicable Interest Period to eliminate such excess and any remaining funds on
deposit in the cash collateral account shall be paid to the Borrower, it being
understood that so long as any such funds are on deposit, interest shall
continue to accrue on the outstanding Loans), and the failure of the Borrower to
make such payment shall constitute an Event of Default.

                                       19

Period in Section 1.01, subject to the following limitations: (i) no Interest

may renew any Libor Rate Loan on the last day of the Interest Period therefor as
the same Type of Loan with an Interest Period of the same or different duration
in accordance with the limitations provided above. If Borrower shall fail to
give notice to the Lender of such a renewal, such Libor Rate Loan shall
automatically become a Prime Rate Loan on the last day of the current Interest
Period for such Libor Rate Loan.

Section 2.08 Certain Notices. Notices by Borrower to Lender of each borrowing
pursuant to Section 2.04, each prepayment, conversion or Revolving Credit
Commitment reduction pursuant to Section 2.05 and each renewal pursuant to
Section 2.07(b): (a) shall be irrevocable; (b) in the case of borrowings and

Day; (c) in the case of borrowings and prepayments of, conversions into and (in
the case of Libor Rate Loans) renewals of Libor Rate Loans, shall be effective

three Business Days prior to such borrowing, prepayment, conversion or renewal.
Each such notice shall specify the type of the Loans to be borrowed, prepaid,
converted or renewed and the amount thereof (subject to Section 2.09) (and, in
the case of a conversion, the Type of Loan to result from such conversion, and,
in the case of a Libor Rate Loan, the Interest Period therefor), the date of the
borrowing or prepayment, or conversion or renewal (which shall be a Business
Day).

      In order to request the issuance of a Letter of Credit, Borrower shall
deliver to Lender a completed and duly executed Application. The procedure with
respect to any Letter of Credit issued or requested to be issued hereunder shall
otherwise be as set forth in Article 3.

Section 2.09 Minimum Amounts. Except for borrowings which exhaust the full
remaining amount of the Revolving Credit Commitment, or prepayments or
conversions which result in the prepayment or conversion of all Loans of a
particular type or conversions made pursuant to Section 4.04, each borrowing,
prepayment, conversion and renewal of principal of Loans of a particular type
shall be in an amount not less than (i) $100,000 in the aggregate in the case of
Prime Rate Loans and (ii) $750,000 in the aggregate (plus increments of $100,000

waived by the Lender (borrowings, prepayments, conversions or renewals of or
into different Types of Loans or, in the case of Libor Rate Loans having
different Interest Periods at the same time hereunder to be deemed separate
borrowings, prepayments, conversions and renewals for the purposes of the
foregoing, one for each Type of Loan and one for each Interest Period). Anything
in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, the aggregate principal
amount of Libor Rate Loans having concurrent Interest Periods shall be at least
equal to $750,000.

Section 2.10 Interest.

             (a) Subject to the other terms and conditions of this Agreement,
interest on each Loan shall be calculated, at Borrower's option, in one or more
of the following manners: (A) a variable interest rate equal to the Prime Rate
plus the Applicable Margin, and (B) subject to availability, at Borrower's
request with respect to Libor Rate Loans, the Libor Rate plus the Applicable
Margin.

             (b) Interest shall accrue on the outstanding and unpaid principal
amount of each Loan for the period from and including the date of such Loan to
but excluding the date such Loan is due. While an Event of Default is
continuing, interest shall accrue at the Default Rate on the outstanding
principal amount of any Loan and any other amount payable by the Borrower
hereunder (to the extent such amount is past due), under the Note or under any
other Facility Document (including the amount of any interest due thereon) to
the fullest extent permitted by law from and including such due date to but
excluding the date such amount is paid in full or such Event of Default is cured
or waived.

             (c) Changes in the rate of interest resulting from changes in the
Prime Rate shall take place immediately without notice or demand of any kind.
Interest on each Loan shall be calculated on the basis of a year of 360 days for
the actual number of days elapsed. Promptly after the determination of any
interest rate provided for herein or any change therein, Lender shall notify
Borrower in writing of such determination.

             (d) All accrued interest shall be paid in arrears (i) for each
Prime Rate Loan on the last Business Day of each Fiscal Quarter commencing on
the first such date after such Loan was made; and (ii) for each Libor Rate Loan,
on the last day of the Interest Period with respect thereto and, in the case of
an Interest Period greater than three months, at three-month intervals after the
first day of such Interest Period; provided that interest accruing at the
Default Rate shall be due and payable from time to time on demand of Lender. In
addition, at the time of conversion of any Loan, all accrued and unpaid interest
shall be due and payable. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, all accrued and unpaid interest shall become due and payable upon the
maturity (whether as scheduled or as accelerated or otherwise) of the Loans.

Section 2.11 Fees.

             (a) Up Front Fee. The Borrower shall pay to Lender an up front fee
equal to $312,500, of which $100,000 has heretofore been paid and $212,500 shall
be due and payable on the date of execution of this Agreement.

             (b) Commitment Fee. The Borrower shall pay to Lender a commitment
fee on the daily average of the Availability, for the period from and including
the Closing Date to the earlier of the date the Revolving Credit Commitment is
terminated or the Revolving Credit Termination Date at the Applicable Margin (as
indicated in the definition of "Applicable Margin"), calculated on the basis of
a year of 360 days for the actual number of days elapsed ("Commitment Fee"). The
accrued Commitment Fee shall be due and payable in arrears on the last Business
Day of each Fiscal Quarter, commencing on the first such date after the Closing

                                       21
<PAGE>

Date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, Lender shall not be entitled to
receive any Commitment Fee for any day that Lender fails or refuses (or has
failed or refused) to make a Revolving Credit Loan as required by this
Agreement, regardless of whether Lender subsequently makes such Revolving Credit
Loan, and the Commitment Fee payable by Borrower shall be calculated
accordingly.

             (c) Standby Letter of Credit Fees. The Borrower shall pay to Lender
Letter of Credit fees equal to the Applicable Margin for Libor Rate Loans
multiplied by the face amount of each Standby Letter of Credit issued hereunder
and outstanding, collected on the basis of a year of 360 days for the actual
number of days elapsed, such fees to be payable in four (4) calendar quarterly
payments based on the face amount of such Letter of Credit on the first day of
each such calendar quarter, the first payment to be made upon issuance of each
such Letter of Credit.

             (d) Letter of Credit Processing Fees. In addition to the fees set
forth in Section 2.11(c), the Borrower agrees to pay, upon demand, the customary
fees, charges and expenses of the Issuing Lender in connection with the issuance
and processing of Letters of Credit, including documentary Letters of Credit.

             (e) Late Payment Fees. If any payment due and payable under this
Agreement, the Note or any other Facility Document is not paid in full within
ten (10) days after the same is due and payable, Borrower shall pay a fee to
Lender equal to the product of (x) the amount of such payment that was due and
payable by (y) two percent (2%).

Section 2.12 Payments Generally. All payments under this Agreement, the Note and
the other Facility Documents shall be made by the Borrower to Lender at 1185
Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY 10036, or such other place as Lender may

America in immediately available funds, without counterclaim or set off and free
and clear of, and without deduction or withholding for, any taxes or other
payments, not later than 12:00 noon New York, New York time on the relevant
dates specified herein (each such payment made after such time on such due date
to be deemed to have been made on the next succeeding Business Day) by, unless
Lender agrees to accept payment by other means, the debiting by Lender for the
account of the applicable Lending Office of Lender, of the amount of any such
payment from any ordinary deposit account of the Borrower with Lender. Borrower
shall, at the time of making each optional prepayment under this Agreement, the
Note or any other Facility Document, and in addition to any notice required by
Section 2.08, specify to Lender the principal or other amount payable by the
Borrower under this Agreement, the Note or such other Facility Document to which
such payment is to be applied (and in the event that it fails to so specify, or
if a Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, Lender may
apply such payment as provided in Section 10.04). If the due date of any payment
under this Agreement, the Note or any other Facility Document would otherwise
fall on a day which is not a Business Day, such date shall be extended to the
next succeeding Business Day (unless, in the case of a Libor Rate Loan, such
extension would carry such due date into another calendar month, in which event
such payment shall be due on the immediately preceding Business Day) and
interest shall be payable for any principal so extended for the period of such
extension. Each payment received by Lender hereunder, under the Note or under
any other

                                       22
<PAGE>

Facility Document shall be paid promptly, in immediately available funds, for
the account of Lender's Lending Office.

            All payments shall be applied first to the payment of all fees,
expenses and other amounts due the Lender (excluding principal and interest),
then to accrued and unpaid interest, and the balance on account of outstanding
principal; provided, however, that after the occurrence and during the
continuance of an Event of Default, payments will be applied as set forth in
Section 10.04.

such issuance, the conditions of Section 2.01(b) and (c) would not be satisfied;
and provided, further, that no Letter of Credit shall be issued in a face amount

connection with any draft presented for payment under any Letter of Credit
shall, in addition to any payment obligation expressly provided for in such

to the Issuing Lender at its address for notices specified herein an Application
therefor, completed to the satisfaction of the

                                       23
<PAGE>

Issuing Lender, and such other certificates, documents and other papers and
information as the Issuing Lender may request. Upon receipt of any Application,
the Issuing Lender shall process such Application and the certificates,
documents and other papers and information delivered to it in connection
therewith in accordance with its customary procedures and shall promptly issue
the Letter of Credit requested thereby (but in no event shall the Issuing Lender
be required to issue any Letter of Credit earlier than three Business Days after
its receipt of the Application therefor and all such other certificates,
documents and other papers and information relating thereto) by issuing the
original of such Letter of Credit to the beneficiary thereof or as otherwise may
be agreed by the Issuing Lender and Borrower. The Issuing Lender shall furnish a
copy of such Letter of Credit to the Borrower promptly following the issuance
thereof.

Section 3.03 Reimbursement; Obligations of Borrower. (a) The Borrower agrees to
reimburse the Issuing Lender on each date on which the Issuing Lender notifies
the Borrower of the date and amount of a draft presented under any Letter of
Credit and paid by the Issuing Lender for the amount of (i) such draft so paid
and (ii) any taxes, fees, charges or other documented out-of-pocket costs or
expenses incurred by the Issuing Lender in connection with such payment
(exclusive and without duplication of any such fees, charges and expenses paid
under Section 2.11(d)). Unless such amounts are paid by the Borrower on the date
of such notice and provided that a Revolving Credit Loan in such amount may be
made pursuant to this Agreement, each drawing honored by the Issuing Lender, to
the extent of the Availability, shall constitute a request to the Lender for a
Revolving Credit Loan in such amount, bearing interest at the Prime Rate
pursuant to Sections 2.07 and 2.10. If a Revolving Credit Loan in such amount
may not be made pursuant to this Agreement, such amount is to be paid by the
Borrower on the date of such notice.

            The Borrower hereby agrees at all times to protect, indemnify and
save harmless, and reimburse upon demand, the Issuing Lender and the Issuing
Lender's correspondents and Lender from and against any and all claims, actions,
suits and other legal proceedings, and from and against any and all losses,
claims, demands, liabilities, damages, costs, charges, reasonable counsel fees
and other documented expenses which the Issuing Lender or the Issuing Lender's
correspondents or Lenders may, at any time, sustain or incur by reason of or in
consequence of or arising out of the issuance of the Letters of Credit, it being
the intention of the parties that this Agreement shall be construed and applied
to protect and indemnify the Issuing Lender and the Issuing Lender's
correspondents and Lender against any and all risks involved in the issuance of
the Letters of Credit, all of which risks are hereby assumed by the Borrower,
including without limitation, any and all risks of the acts of omissions whether
rightful or wrongful, of any present or future de jure or de facto government or
Governmental Authority (all such acts and omissions, herein called the
"Government Acts"). The Issuing Lender shall not, in any way, be liable for any
failure by the Issuing Lender or anyone else to pay any draft under any Letter
of Credit as a result of any Government Acts any other cause beyond the Issuing
Lender's control or the control of the Issuing Lender's correspondents or
Lender, or, if the Issuing Lender, in the Issuing Lender's sole judgment,
determines such payment would violate any applicable Law. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Borrower shall not be
required to indemnify the Issuing Lender, its correspondents or Lender under the
terms of this paragraph to the extent any otherwise covered losses, claims,
demands, liabilities, damages, costs, charges, fees and other expenses arise
from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of any such indemnified party.

             (b) Interest shall be payable at the Prime Rate, plus the
Applicable Margin for Prime Rate Loans (or, if any Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing, at the Default Rate) on any amount remaining unpaid
by the Borrower under Section 3.03(a) from the date such amount becomes payable
until the earlier of (i) the date of payment in full by the Borrower of such
amount, or (ii) the date any Revolving Credit Loan is made with respect to such
amount.

             (c) Each payment made pursuant to this Article III shall be made to
the Issuing Lender at 1185 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY 10036, or such
other address as the Issuing Lender may indicate in writing for such purpose, in
Dollars and in immediately available funds.

Section 3.04 Obligations Absolute. (a) The Borrower's obligations under this
Article III shall be absolute and unconditional under any and all circumstances
and irrespective of any set-off, counterclaim or defense to payment which the
Borrower may have or have had against the Issuing Lender or any beneficiary of a
Letter of Credit.

             (b) Borrower agrees with the Issuing Lender that the Issuing Lender
shall not be responsible for, and the Borrower's reimbursement obligations under
this Article III shall not be affected by, among other things, (i) the validity
or genuineness of documents or of any endorsements thereon, even though such
documents shall in fact prove to be invalid, fraudulent or forged, or (ii) any
dispute between or among the Borrower and any beneficiary of any Letter of
Credit or any other party to which such Letter of Credit may be transferred, or
(iii) any claims whatsoever of the Borrower against any beneficiary of such
Letter of Credit or any such transferee, or (iv) any inability or failure of
Lender to make a Revolving Credit Loan.

             (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Section 3.04 or otherwise in this Agreement, but subject to the specific
provisions of subsection (b) above, the Borrower's obligations under this
Article III shall be subject to, and the Borrower shall have no liability for,
any losses, claims, damages, costs, fees or expenses of Issuing Lender or any of
its correspondents or Lender to the extent any such losses, claims, damages,
costs, fees or expenses that arise from, the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of Issuing Lender, its correspondents or Lender.

Section 3.05 Conflict. To the extent that any provision of any Application
related to any Letter of Credit is inconsistent with the provisions of this
Article III, the provisions of this Article III shall apply.

Section 3.06 Documents. Except insofar as instructions to the contrary have been
previously given by Borrower in writing to the Issuing Lender, the Issuing
Lender and any of its correspondents or Lender may receive and accept as "Bills
of Lading" under any Letter of Credit any documents issued or purporting to be
issued by or on behalf of any carrier which acknowledges receipt of property for
transportation, whatever the specific provisions of such documents, and the date
of each such document shall be deemed the date of shipment of the property
mentioned therein; and the Issuing Lender may receive and accept as documents of
insurance either insurance policies or insurance certificates. Commercial
invoices presented under any Letter of Credit may be referred to for the
description of the goods; unless otherwise

                                       25
<PAGE>

specified in the related Application, wherever the goods are described in other
documents, description in general terms is acceptable.

Section 3.07 Partial Shipments. Except insofar as instructions to the contrary
have been previously given by a Borrower in writing to the Issuing Lender, the
Borrower agrees that partial shipments may be made under any documentary Letter
of Credit and the Issuing Lender may honor the related drafts; and if any
documentary Letter of Credit specifies shipments in installments within stated
periods, and the shipper fails to ship in any designated period, such
documentary Letter of Credit shall cease to be available for that or any
subsequent installment at the Issuing Lender's discretion.

Section 3.08 Extensions, Increases and Other Modifications to Letters of Credit.
The Borrower agrees that in the event of (i) any extension of the maturity or
time for presentation of drafts, acceptances or documents, (ii) any increase in
the amount of any Letter of Credit or (iii) any other modification of the terms
of any Letter of Credit, in each case at the request of Borrower and whether
with or without notification to any other Person, this Agreement shall be
binding upon the Borrower with regard to the Letter of Credit so extended,
increased or otherwise modified, to drafts, documents and property covered
thereby, and to any action taken or omitted to be taken by the Issuing Lender or
any of the Issuing Lender's correspondents or Lender in accordance with such
extension, increase or other modification. Any such extension, increase or other
modification shall, for purposes of this Agreement, be deemed issuance of a new
Letter of Credit.

Section 3.09 Limitations of Liability. The Borrower assumes all risks of the
acts and omissions of the users or beneficiaries of each Letter of Credit and
all risks of misuse of each Letter of Credit.

            Neither the Issuing Lender nor the Issuing Lender's correspondents
or Lender shall be responsible for, and the Borrower's reimbursement obligations
under this Article III shall not be affected by, among other things, (a) the
existence, character, quality, quantity, condition, packing, value or delivery
of the property purporting to be represented by documents; (b) for any
difference in character, quality, quantity, condition, packing or value of the
property from that expressed in documents; (c) for the time, place, manner or
order in which shipment is made; (d) for partial or incomplete shipment or
failure or omission to ship any or all of the property referred to in any Letter
of Credit; (e) for the character, adequacy, validity, or genuineness of any
insurance; (f) for the solvency or responsibility of any insurer, or for any
other risk connected with insurance; (g) for any deviation from instructions,
delay, default or fraud by the shipper or anyone else in connection with the
property or the shipping thereof; (h) for the solvency, responsibility or
relationship to the property of any party issuing any documents in connection
with the property; (i) for delay in arrival or failure to arrive of either the
property or any of the documents relating thereto; (j) for delay in giving or
failure to give notice of arrival or any other notice; (k) for any breach of
contract between the shippers or vendors and the Borrower; (l) for any Laws
which may be effective in jurisdictions of negotiation and/or payment of any
Letter of Credit; (m) for failure of any draft to bear any reference or adequate
reference to any Letter of Credit, or failure of documents to accompany any
draft at negotiation, or failure of any Person to note the amount of any draft
on the reverse of any Letter of Credit or to surrender or take up any Letter of
Credit (unless specifically required on the face and by the

                                       26
<PAGE>

terms of the Letter of Credit) or to send forward documents apart from drafts as
required by the terms of the Letter of Credit; (n) for errors, omissions,
interruptions or delays in transmission, or delivery of any messages, by mail,
cable, telegraph, wireless or otherwise, whether or not they be in cipher; (o)
any error, neglect or default of any of the Borrower's correspondents or
lenders; or (p) the validity, accuracy or genuineness of drafts, documents or
required statements, even if such drafts, documents or statements should in fact
prove to be in any or all respects invalid, inaccurate, fraudulent or forged and
notwithstanding that Borrower shall have notified the Issuing Lender thereof.

            If any Letter of Credit provides that payment is to be made by the
Issuing Lender's correspondent, neither the Issuing Lender nor such
correspondent shall be responsible for the failure of any of the documents
specified in such Letter of Credit to come into the Issuing Lender's hands or
for any delay in connection therewith, and the Borrower's obligations shall not
be affected by such failure or delay in the receipt by the Issuing Lender of any
such documents. In furtherance and extension and not in limitation of the
specified provisions hereinbefore set forth, the Borrower agrees that any action
taken or omission to act by the Issuing Lender or by any correspondent of the
Issuing Lender under or in connection with any Letter of Credit or the relative
drafts, documents or property, if taken or done without gross negligence or
willful misconduct, shall be binding on the Borrower and shall not put the
Issuing Lender or the Issuing Lender's correspondents or Lender under any
resulting liability to the Borrower.

Section 3.10 Compliance with Regulations; Licenses; Insurance. Borrower agrees
to procure promptly any necessary import and export or other licenses for the
import or export or shipping of any property relating to any Letter of Credit
and to comply in all material respects with all applicable Laws in regard to the
shipment of the property or the financing thereof, and to furnish such
certificates in that respect as the Issuing Lender may at any time reasonably
require, and to keep the property adequately covered by insurance reasonably
satisfactory to the Issuing Lender, and to assign the policies or certificates
of insurance to the Issuing Lender, or to make the loss or adjustment, if any,
payable to the Issuing Lender, at the option of the Issuing Lender; and to
furnish to the Issuing Lender upon demand evidence of acceptance by the insurers
of such assignment. Should the insurance upon such property for any reason be
unsatisfactory to the Issuing Lender, the Issuing Lender may, at the Borrower's
expense, obtain insurance on such property reasonably satisfactory to the
Issuing Lender.

Section 3.11 Violations of Law. In the event that any action taken under or in
connection with any Letter of Credit could, in the Issuing Lender's sole
judgment, have the effect of violating any applicable Law, the Issuing Lender
may take or refuse to take any action as it deems necessary, including
dishonoring any draft or acceptance presented hereunder, and the Issuing Lender
shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Borrower from any claim arising
out of such action or inaction on the part of the Issuing Lender, other than any
claim arising from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Issuing
Lender.

Section 3.12 Law and Regulations; Additional Payments. If any future Law or the
future interpretation of any existing or future Law by any Governmental
Authority, or compliance by the Issuing Lender with any future request or
directive (whether or not having the force of law) of any such Governmental
Authority, or the Issuing Lender's reasonable action in anticipation thereof to
enable the Issuing Lender to comply therewith, either (i) imposes, modifies or
deems

                                       27
<PAGE>

applicable or results in the application of, any reserve, special deposit,
capital maintenance, capital ratio or similar requirement against Letters of
Credit (or participations therein) or (ii) imposes on the Issuing Lender any
other condition regarding this Agreement or the Letters of Credit, and the
result thereof is to increase the cost to the Issuing Lender of issuing or
maintaining, or to impose upon the Issuing Lender or increase any capital
requirement applicable as a result of the issue or maintenance of, any Letters
of Credit (or participations therein) or the reimbursement obligations of the
Borrower hereunder, or to reduce the amounts receivable by the Issuing Lender
hereunder (which increase in cost or increase in or imposition of capital
requirements or reduction in amounts receivable may be determined by the Issuing
Lender's reasonable allocation of the aggregate of such costs increases, capital
increases or impositions or reductions in amounts receivable) then, provided
that the Issuing Lender demands similar increased costs with respect to all
other similarly affected letters of credit across the portfolio of such Issuing
Lender, upon demand by the Issuing Lender, the Borrower shall immediately pay to
the Issuing Lender (for itself) from time to time as specified by the Issuing
Lender, additional commissions which shall be sufficient to compensate the
Issuing Lender for such increased cost or increase in (or imposition of) capital
requirements or reduction in amounts receivable by the Issuing Lender together
with interest on each such amount from the date demanded until payment in full
thereof at the Prime Rate, plus the Prime Rate Applicable Margin (or, if any
Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, at the Default Rate).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Borrower shall have no liability for any increased costs otherwise accruing more
than 90 days prior to the receipt by the Borrower of written notice from the
Issuing Lender concerning such increased costs. The Borrower shall pay such
increased costs within five (5) Business Days of receipt of such a written
notice. A certificate setting forth in reasonable detail the increased cost,
reduction in all amounts receivable or amounts necessary to compensate the
Issuing Lender as a result of an increase in (or imposition of) capital
requirements submitted by the Issuing Lender or such L/C Participant to Borrower
shall be conclusive, absent manifest error, as to the amount thereof.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, (a)
nothing in this Section 3.12 shall require the Borrower to compensate the
Issuing Lender for any changes in Law that would increase the amount of general
income taxes payable by such Issuing Lender, and (b) the Issuing Lender shall
take all reasonable steps to avoid such increased cost, including where
reasonable changing the office handling the account.

Section 3.13 Compliance with Letters of Credit. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Article III or otherwise in this Agreement, but
subject to the specific provisions of Sections 3.04(b) and 3.09, the Issuing
Lender, its correspondents and Lender shall at all times be required to comply
with the facial requirements of each Letter of Credit, including, if applicable,
requiring the delivery of documents, which on their face comply with the
requirements of the face of the Letter of Credit before honoring any draws on
any Letter of Credit.

                                   ARTICLE IV
                       YIELD PROTECTION; ILLEGALITY; ETC.

Section 4.01 Additional Costs. (a) The Borrower shall pay directly to Lender
from time to time on demand such amounts as Lender may determine to be necessary
to compensate it for any

                                       28
<PAGE>

increased costs which Lender determines are attributable to its making or
maintaining any Libor Rate Loans under this Agreement or the Note or its
obligation to make any such Loans hereunder, or any reduction in any amount
receivable by Lender hereunder in respect of any such Loans or such obligation
(such increases in costs and reductions in amounts receivable being herein
called "Additional Costs"), resulting from any Regulatory Change relating to any
such Loans or such obligation which: (i) changes the basis (but not the rate) of
taxation of any amounts payable to Lender under this Agreement or the Note in
respect of any of such Loans (other than franchise, capital, branch profits
taxes or taxes imposed with respect to the income of Lender or of its Lending
Office for any of such Loans by the jurisdiction in which Lender or its
designated Lending Office is organized, doing business or has its Principal
Office or such Lending Office); or (ii) imposes or modifies any reserve, special
deposit, deposit insurance or assessment, minimum capital, capital ratio or
similar requirements relating to any extensions of credit or other assets of, or
any deposits with or other liabilities of, Lender (including any of such Loans
or any deposits referred to in the definition of "Libor Rate" in Section 1.01);
provided that no such compensation shall be payable to the extent that the Libor
Rate has been adjusted to account for such increased cost; or (iii) imposes any
other similar condition affecting this Agreement or the Note (or any of such
extensions of credit or liabilities); provided that Lender demands similar
Additional Costs with respect to all other similarly affected loan facilities
across its portfolio. Lender will notify Borrower in writing of any event
occurring after the date of this Agreement which will entitle Lender to
compensation pursuant to this Section 4.01(a) as promptly as practicable after
it obtains knowledge thereof and determines to request such compensation;
provided, that, the Borrower shall have no liability for any such Additional
Costs otherwise accruing more than 90 days prior to the receipt by Borrower of
the written notice concerning such Additional Costs. The Borrower shall pay any
such Additional Costs within five (5) Business Days of receipt of such a written
notice. If Lender requests compensation from the Borrower under this Section
4.01(a), or under Section 4.01(c), Borrower may, by notice to Lender, require
that Lender's affected Loans with respect to which such compensation is
requested be converted in accordance with Section 4.04. If any Additional Costs
are imposed for which the Borrower would be required to make a payment under
this Section 4.01, the Lender in good faith shall attempt to avoid or reduce
such Additional Costs by taking any appropriate action (including, without
limitation, assigning its rights hereunder to a related entity or a different
Lending Office) if such action will not, in the reasonable judgment of Lender,
be disadvantageous to Lender and provided that the Borrower pays any Additional
Costs resulting from such action and the out-of-pocket costs and expenses of
Lender in undertaking such action. The term "Lender" as used in this Section
4.01(a) shall include, if applicable, Lender's parent holding company.

             (b) Without limiting the effect of the foregoing provisions of this
Section 4.01 (but without duplication), in the event that, by reason of any
Regulatory Change, Lender either (i) incurs Additional Costs based on or
measured by the excess above a specified level of the amount of a category of
deposits or other liabilities of Lender which includes deposits by reference to
which the interest rate on Libor Rate Loans is determined as provided in this
Agreement or a category of extensions of credit or other assets of Lender which
includes Libor Rate Loans or (ii) becomes subject to restrictions on the amount
of such a category of liabilities or assets which it may hold, then, if Lender
so elects by notice to the Borrower, the obligation of Lender to make or renew
Libor Rate Loans and to convert Prime Rate Loans hereunder shall be

                                       29
<PAGE>

suspended until the date such Regulatory Change ceases to be in effect (and all
affected Libor Rate Loans held by Lender then outstanding shall be converted in
accordance with Section 4.04).

             (c) Without limiting the effect of the foregoing provisions of this
Section 4.01 (but without duplication), the Borrower shall pay directly to
Lender from time to time on request such amounts as Lender may determine to be
necessary to compensate Lender for any costs of capital which it determines are
attributable to the maintenance by it pursuant to the adoption, effectiveness or
implementation of, or any change in, any Law of any jurisdiction or any written
interpretation, directive or request (whether or not having the force of law and
whether in effect on the date of this Agreement or thereafter) of any
Governmental Authority in respect of its Loans hereunder or its obligation to
make Loans hereunder (such compensation to include, without limitation, an
amount equal to any reduction in return on assets or equity of Lender to a level
below that which it could have achieved but for such Law, interpretation,
directive or request). Lender will notify Borrower in writing if it is entitled
to compensation pursuant to this Section 4.01(c) as promptly as practicable
after it determines to request such compensation, but in no event shall Lender
be entitled to reasonable compensation for any period in excess of 90 days prior
to the date of such notice. The Borrower shall pay such additional compensation
within five (5) Business Days of receipt of such written notice.

             (d) Determinations and allocations by Lender for purposes of this
Section 4.01 of the effect of any Regulatory Change pursuant to subsections (a)
or (b), or of the effect of capital maintained pursuant to subsection (c), on
its costs of making or maintaining Loans or its obligation to make Loans, or on
amounts receivable by, or the rate of return to, it in respect of Loans or such
obligation, and of the additional amounts required to compensate Lender under
this Section 4.01, shall be set forth in certificates, signed by an officer of
Lender, delivered to Borrower. Such certificates shall include the amount
required to be paid by the Borrower to Lender and the computations made by
Lender to determine such amount. Any such determination and allocation shall be
conclusive, absent demonstrable error, provided that such determinations and
allocations are made in good faith and on a reasonable basis.

Section 4.02 Limitation on Libor Rate Loans. Anything herein to the contrary
notwithstanding, if:

             (a) Lender reasonably determines (which determination shall be
conclusive, absent manifest error) that quotations of interest rates for the
relevant deposits referred to in the definition of "Libor Rate" in Section 1.01
are not being provided in the relevant amounts or for the relevant maturities
for purposes of determining the rate of interest for any Libor Rate Loans as
provided in this Agreement; or

             (b) the Lender reasonably determines (which determination shall be
conclusive, absent demonstrable error) that the relevant rates of interest
referred to in the definition of "Libor Rate" in Section 1.01 upon the basis of
which the rate of interest for any Libor Rate Loans are to be determined do not
adequately cover the cost to the Lender of making or maintaining such Loans;

then Lender shall give Borrower prompt written notice thereof, and so long as
such condition remains in effect, the Lender shall be under no obligation to
make or renew affected Libor Rate

                                       30
<PAGE>

Loans, or to convert Prime Rate Loans into affected Libor Rate Loans and the
Borrower shall, on the last day(s) of the then current Interest Period(s) for
the outstanding affected Libor Rate Loans, either prepay such Libor Rate Loans
or convert such Libor Rate Loans into another Type of Loan in accordance with
Section 2.05.

Section 4.03 Illegality. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement,
in the event that it becomes unlawful for Lender or its Lending Office to honor
its obligation to make, maintain or renew Libor Rate Loans hereunder or convert
Prime Rate Loans into Libor Rate Loans, then Lender shall promptly notify
Borrower thereof in writing and Lender's obligation to make, maintain or renew
Libor Rate Loans and to convert Prime Rate Loans into Libor Rate Loans hereunder
shall be suspended until such time as Lender may again make, maintain or renew
such Libor Rate Loans and convert Prime Rate Loans into Libor Rate Loans, and
Lender's outstanding Libor Rate Loans, as the case may be, shall be converted
into Prime Rate Loans in accordance with Section 4.04.

Section 4.04 Certain Conversions Pursuant to Sections 4.01 and Section 4.03. If
Libor Rate Loans are to be converted pursuant to Section 4.01 or Section 4.03,
Libor Rate Loans shall be automatically converted into Prime Rate Loans on the
last day(s) of the then current Interest Period(s) for Libor Rate Loans (or in
the case of a conversion required by Section 4.03, on such earlier date as
Lender may specify in writing to Borrower) and, unless and until Lender gives
notice as provided below that the circumstances specified in Section 4.01 or
Section 4.03 which gave rise to such conversion no longer exist:

             (a) to the extent that Libor Rate Loans have been so converted, all
payments and prepayments of principal which would otherwise be applied to Libor
Rate Loans shall be applied instead to Prime Rate Loans; and

             (b) all Loans which would otherwise be made or renewed by Lender as
Libor Rate Loans shall be made instead as Prime Rate Loans and all Loans which
would otherwise be converted into Libor Rate Loans shall not be so converted.

Section 4.05 Certain Compensation. Subject to Lender's reasonable efforts to
mitigate such losses, costs and expenses, the Borrower shall pay to the Lender,
upon the request of such Lender, such amount or amounts as shall be sufficient
(in the reasonable opinion of Lender) to compensate it for any loss, cost or
reasonable expense which Lender determines is attributable to:

             (a) any payment, prepayment, conversion or renewal of a Libor Rate
Loan made by Lender on a date other than the last day of an Interest Period for
such Loan (whether by reason of acceleration or otherwise); or

             (b) any failure by the Borrower to borrow, convert into or renew a
Libor Rate Loan to be made, converted into or renewed by Lender on the date
specified therefor in the relevant notice under Section 2.04, 2.05 or 2.07, as
the case may be.

Without limiting the foregoing, such compensation shall include an amount equal
to the excess, if any, of: (i) the amount of interest which otherwise would have
accrued on the principal amount so paid, prepaid, converted or renewed or not
borrowed, converted or renewed for the period

                                       31
<PAGE>

from and including the date of such payment, prepayment or conversion or failure
to borrow, convert or renew to but excluding the last day of the then current
Interest Period for such Libor Rate Loan (or, in the case of a failure to
borrow, convert or renew, to but excluding the last day of the Interest Period
for such Libor Rate Loan which would have commenced on the date specified
therefor in the relevant notice) at the applicable rate of interest for such
Libor Rate Loan provided for herein; over (ii) the amount of interest (as
reasonably determined by Lender) Lender would have bid in the London interbank
market for Dollar deposits for amounts comparable to such principal amount and
maturities comparable to such period. A determination of Lender as to the
amounts payable pursuant to this Section 4.05 shall be set forth in
certificates, signed by an officer of Lender, delivered to Borrower. Such
certificates shall include the amount required to be paid by Borrower to Lender
and the computations made by Lender to determine such amount. Any such
determination shall be conclusive, absent demonstrable error, provided that such
determinations are made in good faith and on a reasonable basis.

Section 4.06 Lending Office Designations. Before giving any notice to Borrower
pursuant to Section 4.01, 4.02 or 4.03, Lender shall, if possible, designate a
different Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for giving such
notice and will not, in the reasonable judgment of Lender, be otherwise
disadvantageous to Lender.

equity of and for the fiscal quarters ended March 31, 2002, June 30, 2002 and

have been included in the footnotes thereof. Since December 31, 2001, there has

reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

             (c) Borrower has furnished to the Lender on December 10, 2002, its
projections for the Fiscal Years ending December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2003

the projections, and such differences may be material.

applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code and any other applicable federal or
state law, and no event or condition is occurring or exists concerning which the

Documents exceeds the amount that will be required to be paid on or in respect
of the existing debts and other liabilities (including contingent liabilities)
of the Obligors as they mature.

             (b) The Property of each Obligor does not constitute unreasonably
small capital for such Obligor to carry out its business as now conducted and as
proposed to be conducted including the capital needs of such Obligor.

             (c) Each Obligor does not intend to, nor does such Obligor believe
that it will, incur debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature
(taking into account the timing and amounts of cash to be received by such
Obligor, and of amounts to be payable on or in respect of debt of such Obligor).
The cash available to such Obligor after taking into account all other
anticipated uses of the cash of such Obligor, is anticipated to be sufficient to
pay all such amounts on or in respect of debt of such Obligor when such amounts
are required to be paid.

extending credit for the purpose of purchasing or carrying any margin stock. At
no time would more than 25% of the value of the assets of the Borrower or the

to make the statements contained herein and therein, under the circumstances

individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

Section 12.01 Amendments and Waivers; Remedies Cumulative. Except as otherwise
expressly provided in this Agreement or in any other Facility Document, any
provision of this Agreement or any other Facility Document may be amended or
modified only by an instrument in writing signed by the Borrower and Lender, and
any provision of this Agreement or any other Facility Document may be waived by
the Lender. No failure on the part of the Lender to exercise, and no delay in
exercising, any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof or preclude
any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right. The
remedies herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies
provided by law.

Section 12.02 Usury. All agreements among Borrower, Guarantor(s) and Lender are
hereby expressly limited so that in no contingency or event whatsoever, whether
by reason of acceleration of maturity of the indebtedness evidenced hereby or
otherwise, shall the amount paid or agreed to be paid to Lender for the use or
the forbearance of the indebtedness evidenced hereby exceed the maximum
permissible under applicable law. As used herein, the term "applicable law"
shall mean the law in effect as of the date hereof; provided, however, that in
the event there is a change in the law which results in a higher permissible
rate of interest, then this Agreement or the Note shall be governed by such new
law as of its effective date. In this regard, it is expressly agreed that it is
the intent of Borrower and the Lender in the execution, delivery and acceptance
of this Agreement to contract in strict compliance with the laws of New York
State from time to time in effect. If, under or from any circumstances
whatsoever, fulfillment of any provision hereof or of any of the other Facility
Documents at the time of performance of such provision shall be due, shall
involve transcending the limit of such validity prescribed by applicable law,
then the obligation to be fulfilled shall automatically be reduced to the limits
of such validity, and if under or from circumstances whatsoever Lender should
ever receive as interest an amount which would exceed the highest lawful rate,
such amount which would be excessive interest shall be applied to the reduction
of the principal balance evidenced hereby and not to the payment of interest.
This provision shall control every other provision of all agreements among
Borrower, Guarantors, and Lender.

Section 12.03 Costs; Expenses; Taxes; Indemnification. The Borrower agrees to
pay or reimburse (a) Lender for all its documented costs and expenses

of this Agreement and the Facility Documents and (b) Lender for all costs and
expenses (including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and expenses of
attorneys for the Lender) incurred in connection with the default, collection,
waiver or amendment of this Agreement or any of the Facility Documents, or in
connection with Lender's exercise, preservation or enforcement of any of their
rights, remedies or options hereunder, including without limitation in
connection with (i) the enforcement or preservation of any rights under this
Agreement or the Note or any other Facility Document or any other instrument or
agreement entered into in connection herewith or therewith including, without
limitation, the reasonable fees and disbursements of attorneys for Lender; (ii)
any claim or action threatened, made or brought against Lender arising out of or
relating to any extent to this Agreement, the Security Agreement, the Note or
any other Facility Documents or any instrument or agreement

                                       60

time to time in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
accounting, consulting, brokerage or other similar professional fees or
expenses, and any fees or expenses associated with travel or other costs
relating to any appraisals or examinations conducted in connection with the
Obligations or any Collateral therefor. All such fees and expenses shall be
Obligations secured by the Collateral and, commencing five (5) Business Days
after demand therefor, shall, until paid, bear interest at the rate applicable
to Loans upon the occurrence of an Event of Default. In addition, the Borrower
shall pay any and all stamp and other taxes and fees payable or determined to be
payable in connection with the execution, delivery, filing and recording of any
of the Security Agreement and all related and/or necessary financing statements,
and agree to save the Lender harmless from and against any and all liabilities
with respect to or resulting from any delay in paying or omission to pay such
taxes and fees. The Borrower agrees to indemnify the Lender and its directors,
officers and employees from, and hold each of them harmless against, any and all
costs, losses, liabilities, claims, damages or out-of-pocket expenses incurred
by any of them arising out of or by reason of any investigation of or litigation
or other proceedings (including any threatened investigation or litigation or
other proceedings against Lender) arising out of or relating to this Agreement
or any other Facility Document or to any actual or proposed use by Borrower of
the proceeds of the Loans or other extensions of credit hereunder or to the
performance or enforcement of this Agreement or the other Facility Documents,
including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel
incurred in connection with any such investigation or litigation or other
proceedings. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, this
Section 12.03 shall not be applicable with respect to the Lender or any of its
directors, officers or employees to the extent any cost, loss, liability, claim,
damage, or expense arises solely as a result of the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of the Lender or such other Person.

Section 12.04 Survival. The obligations of the Borrower under Article 3 and
Sections 4.01, 4.05, 12.03, and the obligations of the Lender under Section
12.13, shall survive the repayment of the Loans and the termination of the
Revolving Credit Commitments and continue after the Revolving Credit Termination
Date.

Section 12.05 Assignment; Participations.

             (a) This Agreement shall be binding upon, and shall inure to the
benefit of, the Borrower, the Lender and their respective successors and
assigns, except that the Borrower may not assign or transfer its rights or
obligations hereunder, without prior written consent of the Lender (any of such
assignment or transfer without such consent shall be null and void). Provided
that the requirements of Section 12.05(c) are met, Lender shall have the
unrestricted right at any time or from time to time to assign or sell
participations in all of its rights and obligations hereunder or any part of its
rights and obligations hereunder to another bank or other financial institution
provided that (i) each such assignment shall be in a minimum amount equal to
$3,000,000 and an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof (unless such
amount

                                       61
<PAGE>

constitutes the entire remaining amount of Lender's Commitment), (ii) each such
assignment of Lender's Revolving Credit Commitment shall be of a uniform, and
not a varying, percentage of all rights and obligations under and in respect of
Lender's Revolving Credit Commitment, and (iii) each such assignment of Lender's
Revolving Credit Commitment shall be subject to the consent of the Borrower,
which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed (provided that such
consent shall not be required if a Default or an Event of Default has occurred
and is continuing); in which event (x) in the case of an assignment, upon notice
thereof by Lender to the Borrower, the assignee shall have, to the extent of
such assignment (unless otherwise provided therein), the same rights, benefits
and obligations as it would have if it were a Lender hereunder; and (y) in the
case of a participation, the participant shall have no rights under the Facility
Documents and all amounts payable by the Borrower under the Facility Documents,
including, without limitation, under Article 4, shall be determined as if Lender
had not sold such participation. The agreement executed by Lender in favor of
the participant shall not give the participant the right to require Lender to
take or omit to take any action hereunder except action directly relating to (i)
the extension of a payment date with respect to any portion of the principal of
or interest on any amount outstanding hereunder allocated to such participant,
(ii) the reduction of the principal amount outstanding hereunder allocated to
such participant or (iii) the reduction of the rate of interest payable on such
amount or any amount of fees payable hereunder to a rate or amount, as the case
may be, below that which the participant is entitled to receive under its
agreement with Lender. Lender may furnish any information concerning the
Borrower, any Subsidiary or any other Obligor (or any of their respective
affiliates) in the possession of Lender from time to time to assignees and
participants (including prospective assignees and participants); provided that
Lender shall require any such prospective assignee or such participant
(prospective or otherwise) to agree in writing to maintain the confidentiality
of such information in accordance with the provisions of Section 12.13.

             (b) In addition to the assignments and participations permitted
under paragraph (a) above, Lender may assign and pledge all or any portion of
the Facility Documents, including any portion of the Note, held by it to (i) any
Affiliate of Lender provided that the requirements of Section 12.05(c) are met
with respect to any Affiliate of Lender or (ii) any Federal Reserve Bank
organized under Section 4 of the Federal Reserve Act, 12 U.S.C., Section 341, as
collateral security pursuant to Regulation A and any Operating Circular issued
by such Federal Reserve Bank. No such pledge or assignment or enforcement
thereof shall release the assigning Lender from its obligations hereunder.

             (c) If, pursuant to this Section 12.05, any interest in this
Agreement is transferred to any participant or assignee that is organized under
the laws of any jurisdiction other than the United States or any state thereof,
the Lender transferring such interest (the "Transferor Lender") shall cause such
participant or assignee concurrently with the effectiveness of such transfer,
(i) to represent to the Transferor Lender (for the benefit of the Transferor
Lender and the Borrower) that it is either (A) entitled to the benefits of an
income tax treaty with the United States that provides for an exemption from
United States withholding tax on interest and other payments which may be made
by the Borrower under this Agreement; or (B) is engaged in a trade or business
within the United States and such Loan is effectively connected with such trade
or business, (ii) to furnish to the Transferor Lender and the Borrower either
Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI or Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN
(wherein such participant or assignee claims entitlement to complete exemption
from federal withholding

                                       62
<PAGE>

tax of the United States of America on all payments hereunder) and (iii) to
agree (for the benefit of the Transferor Lender, the Lender and the Borrower) to
provide to the Transferor Lender and Borrower such forms or documentation as may
be required from time to time, including a new Form W-8ECI or Form W-8BEN upon
the obsolescence of any previously delivered form, in accordance with applicable
Laws of the United States of America establishing the current status of such
participant or assignee with regard to continued entitlement to such complete
withholding tax exemption. If, pursuant to this Section 12.05, an interest in
this Agreement is transferred to any participant or assignee that is organized
under the laws of the United States or any state thereof, such assignee or
participant, to the extent required by law, shall provide the Borrower and the
Transferor Lender with a completed Internal Revenue Service Form W-9.

             (d) In the event an assignment is permitted under paragraph (a)
above, Borrower agrees that it shall, and it shall cause each Subsidiary to,
execute, or cause to be executed, such documents, including, without limitation,
non-substantive amendments to the Facility Documents and to any other documents,
instruments and agreements executed in connection herewith as the assigning
Lender shall deem necessary to effect the foregoing. In addition, at the request
of the assigning Lender, and any such assignee, Borrower shall issue one or more
new promissory notes, as applicable, to any such assignee and if the assigning
Lender has retained any of its rights and obligations hereunder following such
assignment, to such Lender which new promissory notes shall be issued in
replacement of but not in discharge of, the liability evidenced by the
promissory note held by such Lender prior to such assignment and shall reflect
the amount of the respective commitments and loans held by such assignee and
such Lender after giving effect to such assignment. Upon the execution and
delivery of appropriate assignment documentation, amendments and any other
documentation required by an assigning Lender in connection with such
assignment, and the payment by assignee of the purchase price agreed to by such
Lender and such assignee, such assignee shall be a party to this Agreement and
shall have all of the rights and obligations of a Lender hereunder (and under
any and all other guaranties, documents, instruments and agreements executed in
connection herewith) to the extent that such rights and obligations have been
assigned by Lender pursuant to the assignment documentation between such
assigning Lender and such assignee, and such assigning Lender shall be released
from its obligations hereunder and thereunder to a corresponding extent.
