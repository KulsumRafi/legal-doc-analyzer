material duties, or (ii) because of conviction of  Employee of a crime involving theft,
embezzlement or fraud against Employer or a civil judgment in which Employer  is awarded
damages from Employee in respect of a claim of loss of funds through fraud or
misappropriation by  Employee, which in either case has become final and is not subject

to be done, or omitted to be done, by Employee consistent with his obligations under

unless and until there shall  have been delivered to Employee a copy of a resolution duly
adopted by the affirmative vote of all of the members  of the Board excluding Employee at
an in-person meeting of the Board called and held for such purpose (after  notice of not
less than 20 business days is provided to Employee and Employee is given an opportunity,

the Split Dollar Agreement between Employer, Douglass N. Ellis and Employee, dated
December 28, 2001(the &quot;<U>Life Insurance Agreement</U>&quot;), shall terminate. During
the Employment Period and any period during which Employee is entitled to receive
benefits pursuant to Sections 5 or 7 hereof, Employer shall continue to pay premiums
(other than out of the cash surrender value) with respect to any split dollar life
insurance agreement, other than the Life Insurance Agreement, to which the Employer and
Employee or a trust established by him are a party immediately prior to the Effective
Time (the &quot;<U>Insurance Agreements</U>&quot;). If the Employment Period is terminated in a
manner which does not result in the payment of benefits pursuant to Sections 5, 6, or 7
hereof, Employer agrees not to terminate any of the Insurance Agreements until the
Employment Period (without consideration to any future extension) or the Noncompete
Period, as the case may be, would have otherwise terminated, provided that Employer's
obligation to pay premiums pursuant to the Insurance Agreements shall be limited to
applying the cash value of the policies (including accumulated dividends and the value
of any paid-up additions) to premium payments. If in such event such cash value is
insufficient to pay all required premiums, Employer shall consult with Employee and
apply cash value to payment of premiums as directed by Employee. As to policies where
such premiums are not to be paid by the application of cash value, at the election of
Employee Employer will either permit Employee to pay premiums to the extent not paid
from the application of cash value or transfer such policies to Employee, conditioned
upon Employee's executing any additional instruments reasonably necessary to preserve
Employer's rights under the Insurance Agreements.</FONT></FONT> </P></TD>
