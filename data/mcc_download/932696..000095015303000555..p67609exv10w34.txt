December 27, 2002

Branson M. ("Tony") Smith
VIA HAND DELIVERY

Dear Tony:

Pursuant to Section 1(b) of your employment agreement dated July 1, 1999 with
Direct Alliance Corporation, as amended and assigned (the "Agreement") to
Insight Enterprises, Inc. (the "Company"), you are hereby notified that there
shall be no further renewal of the Agreement after December 31, 2002, and that,
accordingly, such Agreement shall expire on December 31, 2004.

Please note that by giving this notice the Company does not intend to terminate
your employment. Instead, as we have previously discussed, the only result of
our action today is that the expiration date of the term of the Agreement will
become fixed and it will no longer renew for a full two-year term each day.

Additionally, please note that the following is the notice address the Company
has on file for you pursuant to the Agreement:

      3680 South Greythorne Way
      Chandler, Arizona  85248

We believe this address may be out of date. To update this address, please
notify Deanna Carney or Bob Moya in writing (email acceptable) of your current
correct address.

If you have any questions, please let me know.  Thank you.

Sincerely,

Timothy A. Crown
Chief Executive Officer
