<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Guaranty, dated as of August&nbsp;21, 2002 is made by Telephone and Data Systems,&nbsp;Inc. (the "Guarantor"), in favor of The Toronto-Dominion Bank (the
"Counterparty"). </FONT></P>

SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guaranty.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;In order to induce the Counterparty to enter into a Confirmation, dated
August&nbsp;21, 2002 (Reference number: 892626-883688) with respect to a prepaid variable equity forward transaction in respect of 11,000,000 shares of Deutsche Telekom AG (the "Agreement", which
term shall include the Agreement as the same may be amended, modified or altered from time to time), with the Guarantor's wholly-owned subsidiary TDSI Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Primary
Obligor"), which Agreement supplements, forms a part of and is subject to an ISDA Master Agreement, dated as of August&nbsp;21, 2002, between Counterparty and Primary Obligor, the Guarantor
absolutely and unconditionally guarantees to the Counterparty, its successors and permitted assigns, the prompt payment of the Guaranteed Obligations, as defined below. Except as expressly provided
herein, such guarantee shall be without regard to any counterclaim, set-off, deduction or defense of any kind which Primary Obligor or the Guarantor may have or assert against Counterparty, and
without abatement, suspension, deferment or diminution on account of any event or condition whatsoever. "Guaranteed Obligations" shall mean all amounts payable by the Primary Obligor under the
Agreement, whether due or to become due, secured or unsecured, joint or several together with any and all costs and expenses incurred by Counterparty in enforcing Counterparty's rights under this
Guaranty, after applying any right of Primary Obligor to set-off, net or withhold payment as provided in the Agreement. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;Guarantor
agrees that the Counterparty may resort to Guarantor for payment of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, whether or not Counterparty shall have realized against
or applied, or attempted (except as provided below) to realize against or apply, any property provided by an entity as collateral security or other credit support for the Guaranteed Obligations (such
property and credit support collectively, "Security") or proceeded or attempted to proceed against Primary Obligor or any other entity principally or secondarily obligated with respect to the
Guaranteed Obligations. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Counterparty agrees that it will not make a demand or claim under
this Guaranty in respect of any Secured Portion (defined below) of the Guaranteed Obligations unless the Counterparty has first used commercially reasonable efforts, for at least three Business Days,
to realize against or apply property held as Collateral (as defined in the Agreement) under the Agreement in satisfaction of the Guaranteed Obligations. "Secured Portion" means, at any time, a portion
of the Guaranteed Obligations consisting of the obligation to deliver cash or property with a value, as determined by the Calculation Agent (as defined in the Agreement), equal to the value, as
determined by the Calculation Agent in a consistent manner, of the Collateral then pledged to the Counterparty under the Agreement; provided that if no Collateral is then pledged to Counterparty or
Counterparty ceases to have a valid, first priority, perfected security interest in the Collateral other than as a result of actions of the Counterparty, there shall be no Secured Portion of the
Guaranteed Obligations. </FONT></P>

SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nature of Guaranty.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Guaranty is a guarantee of payment and not of collection. Any amounts or deliveries
that would be owed or due by Primary Obligor to the Counterparty under the Agreement but are unenforceable or not allowable against Primary Obligor for any reason, including because Primary Obligor is
the subject of a bankruptcy, liquidation, reorganization or similar case or proceeding, shall nonetheless be deemed owed or due for the purposes of this Guaranty. The Counterparty shall not be
obligated, as a condition precedent to performance by the Guarantor hereunder, to file any claim relating to the Guaranteed Obligations in the event that Primary Obligor becomes subject to a
bankruptcy, liquidation, reorganization or similar case or proceeding, and the failure of the Counterparty to file a claim shall not affect the Guarantor's obligations hereunder. This </FONT></P>
