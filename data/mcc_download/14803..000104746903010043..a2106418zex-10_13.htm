<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Place of Employment.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless otherwise agreed by the Company and Employee, throughout the Employment Period of

Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($350,000.00) per annum, payable semi-monthly on the fifteenth and final&nbsp;days of each month during the Employment Period, subject to such increases and
