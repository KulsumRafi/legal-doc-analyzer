<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the Plan places certain restrictions on the Award which could lead to forfeiture of the shares prior to lifting the Plan restrictions and because you have
agreed to waive the Section&nbsp;83(b) election<SUP>(1)</SUP>, the value of the restricted stock is not taxed to you when the initial grant is made. Rather, the stock is taxable to you at the

subject to withholding of income taxes, Medicare taxes and, if applicable, Social Security taxes. You are not taxed on the value of any stock forfeited. </FONT></P>

<HR NOSHADE ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="120">

<DT style='margin-bottom:-11pt;'><FONT SIZE=2>(1)</FONT></DT><DD><FONT SIZE=2>The
Plan requires that as a condition to receiving a Restricted Stock Award, you must waive in writing the right to make an election under Section 83(b) of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986 with respect to your Award (see Section 7 D of the Plan). This waiver means that you will not have the option of electing to be taxed on the restricted shares at the time of grant. Instead,
you will be taxed
on the restricted shares at the time the Plan restrictions are removed. This allows the Company to treat dividends paid during the period of Plan restrictions as compensation, thereby giving the
Company a tax deduction for such amounts. </FONT></DD></DL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For
purposes of determining the gain or loss on any sale of the stock received pursuant to this Award, your basis in the stock is the amount that you included in taxable income when the
Plan restrictions were removed. Your tax holding period, for purposes of determining whether a gain or loss on a sale is long-term or short-term, begins on the day after the
day that the Plan restrictions were removed. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;Except
as provided in paragraph&nbsp;3(b) below, the Option will terminate upon the earlier to occur of: (1)&nbsp;when all Option Shares have been exercised; or
(2)&nbsp;ten (10)&nbsp;years from the Grant Date ("Expiration Date"). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;If
Participant ceases employment, the Option will terminate as to any unvested Option Shares on the effective date of employment Termination (as defined in the Plan) and
as to vested Option Shares 90&nbsp;days after Participant's effective date of Termination. If Participant ceases employment because of Participant's Retirement, Disability (each as defined in the
Plan), or death, the Option will terminate as to any unvested Option Shares on the effective date of the Retirement, Disability or death, and as to vested Option Shares, the Option will remain
exercisable until the earlier of 60&nbsp;months after such effective date or the Expiration Date. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;In
the event of Participant's death during the Option Period, vested Option Shares may be exercised by Participant's legal representative(s), or by other person(s)
authorized under Participant's will. Alternatively, if Participant fails to make testamentary disposition of the Option or dies intestate, such vested Option Shares may be exercised by persons(s)
entitled to receive the Option Shares under the applicable laws of descent and distribution. </FONT></P>

transfer of Participant's employment between Constellation Energy and any Subsidiary of Constellation Energy, or between Subsidiaries of Constellation Energy, will not
be considered an employment Termination. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exercise of Option.  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject
to this Agreement and the Plan, the Option may be exercised in whole or in part by filing a written notice with the Corporate Secretary of Constellation Energy
at 750 East Pratt Street, 18<SUP>th</SUP> Floor, Baltimore, Maryland 21202. The notice of exercise must be given before Constellation Energy's close of business on the last business day that occurs
before the date the Option terminates as provided in Section&nbsp;3(a) or (b)&nbsp;above. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;On
or before the exercise date specified in the notice, Participant must fully pay the Exercise Price and the tax withholding obligation for the Option Shares exercised
in U.S. dollars by cash or by check payable to Constellation Energy Group,&nbsp;Inc. All or a portion of the Exercise Price and tax withholding obligation may also be paid by Participant:
(i)&nbsp;subject to the terms of paragraph&nbsp;4(c) below, by delivery of shares of Stock owned by Participant and acceptable to the Plan Administrator having an aggregate Fair Market Value (as
defined in 6 below) on the date of exercise that is equal to the amount of cash that would otherwise be required; or (ii)&nbsp;by authorizing a third party to sell the Option Shares (or a sufficient
portion of the Option Shares), and immediately remit to Constellation Energy the Exercise Price and any tax withholding resulting from such exercise. Further, tax withholding up to the minimum
required withholding rate (but not in excess of that rate) may also be satisfied through a holdback by Constellation Energy of some of the Option Shares that would otherwise be deliverable to
Participant by reason of the Option exercise. The Option will cease to be exercisable, as to the portion exercised, when Participant purchases the Stock to which the exercised portion of the Option
relates. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;Other
shares of Stock owned by Participant may be delivered to satisfy the Exercise Price, or to satisfy Participant's tax withholding obligation above the minimum
withholding rate, only if the shares have been held by Participant for at least six months before delivery, except that there shall be no holding period imposed for shares purchased by Participant for
cash on the open market. Use of previously-owned shares shall be effected by actual delivery of the Stock certificates to Constellation Energy, and by completing an affidavit available from
Constellation Energy affirming that Participant owns the necessary shares and that any applicable holding period has been satisfied. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Option may not be exercised by Participant during any blackout or prohibited trading period established by Constellation Energy or applicable to Participant, nor
shall the Option be exercisable if and to the extent Constellation Energy determines that such exercise would violate applicable state or Federal securities laws or the rules and regulations of any
securities exchange on which the Stock is traded. If Constellation Energy makes such a determination, it will use all reasonable efforts to comply with such laws, rules or regulations. In making any
such determinations, Constellation Energy may rely on the opinion of counsel for Constellation Energy. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;As
soon as practicable after the exercise date, Constellation Energy will deliver to Participant a Stock certificate or certificates (or other evidence of ownership) for
the purchased Option Shares. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tax Withholding.  </B></FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Constellation Energy will have the right to withhold any applicable federal, state or local taxes, deductions or withholdings due with respect to the Option or
its exercise in such form and manner as provided in the Plan. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fair Market Value.  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Fair Market Value" of a share of Stock is the average of the highest and lowest sale price per share of Stock on the New York Stock Exchange-Composite
Transactions on the applicable date of reference, or if there are no sales on such date, then the average of such highest and lowest sale price on the last previous day on which sales are reported. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No Rights of Stockholders.  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participant does not have any of the rights and privileges of a stockholder of Constellation Energy with respect to any shares of Stock purchasable or issuable
upon the exercise of the Option, in whole or in part, before the date of exercise and purchase of the Option Shares. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Non-Transferability of Option.  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Option is not transferable, except for a transfer to a Participant's family member or to a trust established for the benefit Participant's family members
which has been approved by the Plan Administrator as provided in the Plan, or in case of Participant's death, by will or the laws of descent and distribution, nor shall the Option be subject to
attachment, execution or other similar process. During Participant's lifetime, the Option is exercisable only by Participant, any guardian or legal representative of Participant, or a family member or
trustee of a trust established for the benefit of Participant's family members to whom the Option has been transferred in accordance with the Plan. In the event of (a)&nbsp;any attempt by
Participant to alienate, assign, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of the Option, except as provided in this Agreement, or (b)&nbsp;the levy of any attachment, execution or similar process
upon the rights or interest conferred under this Agreement, Constellation Energy may terminate the Option by notice to Participant and it will become null and void. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employment Not Affected.  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither this Agreement nor the grant of the Option constitutes a contract of employment between Constellation Energy or any Subsidiary and Participant, and
neither will be deemed to be consideration for, or a condition of, continued employment of Participant. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>10.&nbsp;&nbsp;Incorporation of Plan by Reference.  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Option is granted pursuant to the terms of the Plan, the terms of which are incorporated by reference. The Option will in all respects be interpreted in
accordance with the Plan. All capitalized terms, which are not otherwise defined in this Agreement, will have the meaning specified in the Plan. The Plan Administrator will interpret and construe the
Plan and this Agreement, and its interpretations and determinations will be conclusive and binding on the parties and any other person claiming an interest with respect to any issue arising under this
Agreement. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>11.&nbsp;&nbsp;Severability.  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions of this Agreement are severable. If any one or more provisions are determined to be illegal or otherwise unenforceable, in whole or in part, the
remaining provisions will nevertheless be binding and enforceable. </FONT></P>
