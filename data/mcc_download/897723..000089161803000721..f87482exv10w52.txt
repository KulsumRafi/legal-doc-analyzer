         Re:      Employment Agreement

Dear Gene:

         The term of the Employment Agreement of September, 2001 between
yourself and Sanmina-SCI Corporation (the "Employment Agreement") is set to
expire on December 6, 2002. Your efforts to assist in the integration of the
Sanmina and SCI business operations have proven highly valuable in the past
twelve months. To continue your efforts in assisting in the integration of the
two companies, the Company wishes to extend your term of employment. By
executing this letter, you agree to extend the term of your employment, as
described in Section 1 of the Employment Agreement, until December 6, 2003. This
letter will also amend Section 2 of your Employment Agreement to provide that
your services as Co-Chairman of Sanmina-SCI Corporation and SCI Systems, Inc.
will end on December 6, 2002 and that your employment during the extended term
will continue to focus on providing leadership to the Company in its efforts to
integrate the Sanmina and SCI operations and assistance in the Company's
transition efforts. In addition, during your extended term of employment, you
will continue to be eligible for the same base salary and employee benefit
programs as described in Sections 3(c) through 3(f) of the Employment Agreement.
If you retire prior to December 6, 2003, your retirement will be governed by the
provisions of Section 5(a) of the Employment Agreement.

         With the exception of the changes set forth in this letter, your
Employment Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. If the extension of
your Employment Agreement as set forth above is acceptable to you, please sign
where provided below. As stated above, we look forward to working together to
make Sanmina-SCI Corporation a leader in our industry.
