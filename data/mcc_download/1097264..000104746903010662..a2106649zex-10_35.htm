<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except as otherwise set forth in the Consulting Agreement of even date herewith by and between Allos Therapeutics,&nbsp;Inc. (the "Company") and the undersigned
Stephen J. Hoffman (the "Consulting Agreement") to which this Exhibit&nbsp;B is attached, I, Stephen J. Hoffman, pursuant to this Release Agreement ("Release"), hereby release, acquit and forever
discharge the Company, its parent, subsidiaries, and affiliated companies, and their officers, directors, agents, servants, employees, attorneys, shareholders, successors, assigns and affiliates, of
and from any and all claims, liabilities, demands, causes of action, costs, expenses, attorneys fees, damages, indemnities and obligations of every kind and nature, in law, equity, or otherwise, known
and unknown, arising out of or in any way related to agreements, events, acts or conduct at any time prior to and including the date this Release is signed, including but not limited to: all such
claims and demands directly or indirectly arising out of or in any way connected with my relationship with the Company or the termination thereof; claims or demands related to salary, bonuses,
commissions, stock, stock options, or any other ownership interests in the Company, vacation pay, fringe benefits, expense reimbursements, severance pay, or any other form of compensation; claims
pursuant to any federal, state or local law, statute or cause of action including, but not limited to, the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended; the federal Americans with Disabilities Act of
1990; the federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, as amended ("ADEA"); the Colorado Civil Rights Act; tort law; contract law; wrongful discharge; discrimination; retaliation; harassment;

release any claims arising after the date hereof under the terms of the Consulting Agreement. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I
acknowledge that I am knowingly and voluntarily waiving and releasing any rights I may have under the ADEA, as amended. I also acknowledge that the consideration given for the waiver
and release in the preceding paragraph hereof is in addition to anything of value to which I was already entitled. I further acknowledge that I have been advised by this writing, as required by the
ADEA, that: (a)&nbsp;my waiver and release do not apply to any rights or claims that may arise after the execution date of this Release; (b)&nbsp;I have been advised hereby that I have the right
to consult with an attorney prior to executing this Release; (c)&nbsp;I have twenty-one (21)&nbsp;days to consider this Release (although I may choose to voluntarily execute this
Release earlier); (d)&nbsp;I have seven (7)&nbsp;days following the execution of this Release by the parties to revoke the Release; and (e)&nbsp;this Release will not be effective until the date
upon which the revocation period has expired, which will be the eighth day after this Release is executed by me. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I
UNDERSTAND THAT THIS AGREEMENT INCLUDES A RELEASE OF ALL KNOWN AND UNKNOWN CLAIMS. In giving this release, which includes claims which may be unknown to me at present, I hereby
expressly waive and relinquish all rights and benefits under any law of any jurisdiction purporting to limit the effect of a general release with respect to my release of any unknown or unsuspected
claims I may have against the Company. </FONT></P>
