</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the Southwestern Energy Company 2002 Employee Stock
Incentive Plan is to enable the Company to attract and retain employees that
(i)&nbsp;are not officers or directors of Southwestern Energy Company for purposes
of Section&nbsp;16 of the Exchange Act and (ii)&nbsp;are the best available personnel for
positions of substantial responsibility, to reward such employees for superior
performance and to strengthen the mutuality of interests between such employees
and Southwestern&#146;s shareholders. The Plan is designed to meet this intent by
providing such employees with a proprietary interest in pursuing the long-term
growth, profitability and financial success of the Company in order to provide
them with additional motivation to continue in the Company&#146;s employ and to
further its profitable growth.

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the election of the Participant, subject to the approval of the
Committee, when shares of Common Stock are to be issued upon the exercise of an
Option or SAR or the grant of Restricted Stock, or when restrictions on
Restricted Stock lapse, Southwestern shall withhold a number of such shares
having a Fair Market Value at the exercise date determined by the Committee to
be sufficient to satisfy the federal, state and local withholding tax
requirements, if any, attributable to such exercise, grant or lapse of
restrictions, but not greater than such withholding obligations. Such election
shall satisfy the Participant&#146;s obligations under Section&nbsp;14(a) hereof, if any.

</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board of Directors may at any time suspend or discontinue the Plan or
revise or amend it in any respect whatsoever; provided, however, that any
revision or amendment to the Plan that requires the approval of shareholders
pursuant to New York Stock Exchange Listing Requirements or applicable law
shall not be made until such approval of shareholders is obtained. Nothing
herein shall restrict the Committee&#146;s ability to exercise its discretionary
authority hereunder pursuant to Section&nbsp;4 hereof, which discretion may be
exercised without amendment to the Plan. No action hereunder may, without the
consent of a Participant, materially reduce the Participant&#146;s rights under any
previously granted and outstanding Incentive Award. Nothing herein shall limit
the right of Southwestern to pay compensation of any kind outside the terms of
the Plan.

</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject to Section&nbsp;6(c)(5), upon the death of a Participant, outstanding
Incentive Awards granted to such Participant may be exercised only by the
executors or administrators of the Participant&#146;s estate or by any person or
persons who shall have acquired such right to exercise by will or by the laws
of descent and distribution. Subject to Section&nbsp;6(c)(5), no transfer by will or
the laws of descent and distribution of any Incentive Award, or the right to
exercise any Incentive Award, shall be effective to bind Southwestern unless
the Committee shall have been furnished with (a)&nbsp;written notice thereof and
with a copy of the will and/or such evidence as the Committee may deem
necessary to establish the validity of the transfer and (b)&nbsp;an agreement by the
transferee to comply with all the terms and conditions of the Incentive Award
that are or would have been applicable to the Participant and to be bound by
the acknowledgements made by the Participant in connection with the grant of
the Incentive Award. Except as provided in Section&nbsp;17 or Section&nbsp;6(c)(5), no
Incentive Award shall be transferable, and shall be exercisable only by a
Participant during the Participant&#146;s lifetime.

failure by a Participant to comply with any of the terms and conditions of the
Plan or the agreement executed by such Participant evidencing an Incentive
Award, unless such failure is remedied by such Participant within ten days
after having been notified of such failure by the Committee, shall be grounds
for the cancellation and forfeiture of such Incentive Award, in whole or in
part, as the Committee may determine.
