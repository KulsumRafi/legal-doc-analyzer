         A. Paragon and Chalone entered into a Joint Venture  Agreement on April

Venture Agreement,  as amended by the 1996 Amendment,  and as amended herein, is
referred to hereinafter as the "Joint Venture  Agreement," and the joint venture
established thereby is referred to hereinafter as the "Joint Venture."

         B. Paragon and Chalone  desire to amend the Joint Venture  Agreement in
those respects specified herein, and only in those respects specified herein.

         IN  CONSIDERATION  of the foregoing and the mutual  covenants set forth

1.       AMENDMENTS TO ARTICLE V OF THE JOINT VENTURE AGREEMENT
         (SUPPLY OF GRAPES BY PARAGON TO THE JOINT VENTURE)

         Article V of the Joint  Venture  Agreement  is  hereby  amended  in the
following respects and in the following respects only.

         Section  5.1(a) is hereby  amended in its  entirety to read as follows:
"(a) Paragon and the Joint  Venture  shall,  concurrently  with the execution of
this  Amendment,  enter into the Second  Amended  and  Restated  Grape  Purchase
Agreement (the "Amended Grape Purchase  Agreement"),  substantially  in the form
attached  hereto as EXHIBIT A. The Joint  Venture  may,  upon  Review  Committee
approval,  purchase  and resell,  or vint as bulk wine,  a portion of the grapes
required to be purchased by the Joint Venture from Paragon."

2.       AMENDMENTS TO ARTICLE VII OF THE JOINT VENTURE AGREEMENT
         (DISTRIBUTIONS; ALLOCATION OF INCOME AND LOSS)

         Article VII of the Joint  Venture  Agreement  is hereby  amended in the
following respects and in the following respects only.

         Section 7.3 is hereby  added to Article VII to read in its  entirety as
follows:

         "7.3 DISTRIBUTIONS

         For  purposes  of  covering  the  estimated  taxes of each of the Joint
Venture  Partners in connection  with the Joint Venture,  by December 15 of each
year, the Joint Venture shall  distribute to the Joint Venture  Partners cash in
the aggregate  amount of fifty  percent  (50%) of the projected  earnings of the
Joint  Venture for that year as  reasonably  determined  by the  Managing  Joint
Venture  Partner.  In addition,  by April 15 of the  following  year,  the Joint
Venture shall distribute to the Joint Venture  Partners an additional  amount of
cash  sufficient  to  bring  the  aggregate  amount  of  distributions  made  to
sixty-seven  percent  (67%) of the actual  earnings of the Joint Venture for the
previous year; PROVIDED,  HOWEVER, that if by April 15 the Joint Venture has not


                                       2


<PAGE>


yet  determined  actual  earnings for the previous  year, a good faith  estimate
shall  be  paid  and  the  Joint  Venture   shall  adjust  the  foregoing   cash
distributions totaling sixty-seven percent (67%) to reflect actual earnings once
determined.

         If the  adjustment  requires  additional  distributions  to  the  Joint
Venture Partners, the Joint Venture shall make such additional  distributions as
soon as practically possible. If the aggregate  distributions made exceed 67% of
actual earnings,  the Joint Venture may subtract the overpayment from subsequent
distributions  to be made to the Joint Venture  Partners.  In certain years, the
Joint  Venture  Partners  may agree to reduce or increase  the 67%  provided for
above.

         The Joint Venture  computation  of profits  shall be made  according to
generally accepted  accounting  principles and shall be audited by the Company's
accountants.

3.       AMENDMENTS TO ARTICLE VIII OF THE JOINT VENTURE AGREEMENT
         (MANAGEMENT OF THE JOINT VENTURE)

         Article VIII of the Joint  Venture  Agreement  is herby  amended in the
following respects and in the following respects only.

         Section 8.3(d) is hereby amended in its entirety to read as follows:

         "(d)  The  Managing  Director  of the  Committee  shall  be  Thomas  B.
Selfridge,  so long as Mr. Selfridge serves as a director of Chalone and so long
as Chalone remains the Managing Joint Venture  Partner of the Joint Venture.  In
the event that Mr.  Selfridge is no longer qualified or is unable to serve, at a
point in time when Chalone is the Managing  Joint  Venture  Partner of the Joint
Venture, then the position of Managing Director of the Committee shall be filled
as  follows:  Chalone  shall,  by  written  notice to  Paragon,  identify  three
candidates  each of whom is an officer or  director of Chalone and each of whom,


                                       3


<PAGE>


by reason of his or her  education,  training,  experience  and knowledge of the
wine  business and the business of the Joint  Venture,  is qualified to serve as
Managing  Director  of the  Committee.  The written  notice  shall  specify,  in
reasonable  detail,  the  qualifications  of each candidate to serve as Managing
Director of the  Committee.  Within thirty (30) days of receipt of the aforesaid
notice from Chalone,  Paragon shall notify Chalone, in writing, of its agreement
to the election of one of the three candidates identified by Chalone to serve as
Managing  Director of the Committee,  and such person shall  thereafter serve as
managing  Director of the Committee  pursuant to the terms and provisions of the
Joint Venture Agreement.  If Paragon does not notify Chalone, in writing, of its
agreement to the selection of one of the three candidates  identified by Chalone
within  thirty  (30) days of  Paragon's  receipt of the notice  from  Chalone as
aforesaid,  then  Chalone  may,  by notice to  Paragon,  select one of the three
candidates  identified by Chalone as the Managing Director of the Committee.  In
the event that Chalone  ceases to be the Managing  Joint Venture  Partner of the
Joint  Venture,  then the position of Managing  Director of the Committee  shall
forthwith become vacant and the individual who shall serve as Managing  Director
of the  Committee  shall be  determined  by the Review  Committee.  The Managing
Director of the  Committee  shall  preside at all meetings of the  Committee and
shall exercise and perform such other powers and duties as may from time to time
be assigned to him by the Committee."

         Section 8.5(e)(i) is hereby amended in its entirety to read as follows:

         "(i) The Joint  Venture shall bear all costs of promotion and marketing
of the wines sold by the Joint  Venture  except  asprovided  by  paragraph  (ii)
below.  In  consideration  thereof and its services  rendered in  promoting  and

                                       4

Partner shall not receive any commission  for wines sold at the Winery,  through
the Edna Valley VineyardWine Club, or over the internet,  PROVIDED, HOWEVER, any
costs  incurred by the  Managing  General  Partner for  internet  sales shall be
reimbursed on a monthly basis. The Managing Joint Venture  Partner's  commission

category sale:

              (A)  Private label wines:  five percent (5%).

follows:

         "(ii)  Chalone  shall act as  distributor  of the Winery's wine for the

time to time by the Review Committee,  with affirmative approval required of the
Review Committee for Chalone's  continuation as a distributor from year to year.
Subject  to the  foregoing,  as  distributor  of the  wines  of  the  Winery  in
California,  Chalone shall be entitled to purchase the wines for distribution at
the wholesale  price thereof net of all discounts  (including  special  purchase
allowances  (SPAs),  depletion  allowances and any other similar  accommodations
offered to the  trade),  less 25%. In  addition,  the Joint  Venture  shall bear
one-half of Chalone's  wine sample costs and wine list  charges.  If at any time
Chalone both ceases to be the  distributor  for the state of  California  and no
longer receives a margin  commission from a broker or distributor in California,
Chalone's  commission  for branded wines sold in California  shall be eleven and
one-quarter percent (11.25%) computed pursuant to Section 8.5(e)(i).

4.       REDUCTION IN REVENUE TO PARAGON

         The annual  payments  to Paragon for grapes or  distributions  shall be

                  2005                                            $250,000
                  2006 through and including 2021                 $300,000
