maximum number of shares of Common Stock to be issued upon exercise of the
Warrant shall be equal to the quotient determined by dividing (X)&nbsp;the Black
Scholes Warrant Valuation by (Y)&nbsp;the exercise price per share as determined
above; provided that such quotient shall be rounded up to the nearest whole
number (&#147;Share Formula&#148;). The parties agree that, for the purposes of
determination of the value of the Warrant, the &#147;Black Scholes Warrant
Valuation&#148; shall be Two Hundred Thousand Dollars ($200,000).

costs associated with said exchange shall be borne solely by Seller and shall
in no way be attributable to Buyer. In no event shall (a)&nbsp;such cooperation
entail any additional expense or cause any liability whatsoever to the
non-exchanging party and (b)&nbsp;Buyer be required to take title to the exchanged
property(ies) to effectuate the tax deferred exchange contemplated by this
Section&nbsp;10.9. An assignment to an exchange facilitator pursuant to this
Section shall not relieve either party from any of its obligations hereunder
nor shall the ability to consummate a 1031 exchange be a condition to the
Closing. Seller shall have the right to extend the Closing upon written notice
to Buyer, delivered by Seller to Buyer not later than five (5)&nbsp;Business Days
prior to the anticipated Closing Date, for a period of up to thirty (30)&nbsp;days
