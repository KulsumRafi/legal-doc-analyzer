                                    ACCOUNT

        4.1 ESTABLISHING A PARTICIPANT'S ACCOUNT. The Committee shall establish
an Account for each Participant in a special Foreign Deferred Compensation
Ledger which shall be maintained by the Company. The Account shall reflect the
amount of the Company's obligation to the Participant at any given time.
        4.2 BASIC BENEFIT ACCOUNT. The Basic Benefit shall be credited to each
Participant's Basic Benefit Account as of the last day of each month of each
Plan Year for the accrual attributable to Compensation paid during that month.
        4.3 GAUGE FOR DETERMINING BENEFITS. Except as specified in Section 4.4,
the Basic Benefit credits described in Section 4.2 shall be credited in
non-monetary units equal to the number of whole shares of Common Stock that
could have been purchased at a price equal to the average closing sale price of
a share of Common Stock during the calendar month for which the allocation is
made as reported by the principal national securities exchange on which the
Common Stock is then listed, if the Common Stock is listed on a national
securities exchange, or the average of the bid and asked price of a share of
Common Stock during such month as reported in the National Association of
Securities Dealers Automated Quotation National Market System (or successor
system) listing if the Common Stock is not then listed on a national securities
exchange, provided that if no such closing price or quotes are so reported
during that month or if, in the discretion of the Committee, another means of
determining the fair market value of the Common Stock for such month shall be
necessary and advisable, the Committee may provide for another means of
determining such value and in monetary units for any amount that is less than
the value of a whole share. Any monetary unit credited to an Account will be
added to the next such amount credited to

                                      IV-1
<PAGE>
the Account and converted into a non-monetary unit as quickly as possible. The
value of each unit credited to an Account and therefore the ultimate value of
the deferred compensation payable to each Participant will increase or decrease
in proportion to the change in the value of a share of Common Stock between the
date of the initial crediting of a unit and the date that the unit is valued
for distribution under Article VI of the Plan.
        4.4 ADJUSTMENTS FOR THE GRANT SPIN-OFF. Following the Grant Spin-Off,
each Participant's Account was deemed credited with one non-monetary unit equal
to one share of Grant Stock for every one non-monetary unit equal to one share
of Common Stock that was deemed to be credited to his Account as of the date of
the Grant Spin-Off or subsequently credited to his Account for Compensation
earned through the date of the Grant Spin-Off.

                                 DISTRIBUTIONS

        6.1 DEATH. Upon the death of a Participant, his Beneficiary shall
receive the value of the amounts credited to the Participant's Accounts in the
Foreign Deferred Compensation Ledger determined under Section 6.7, and the
distribution shall be made in shares of Common Stock. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, to the extent that shares of Grant Stock were deemed credited to the
Participant's Account in connection with the Grant Spin-Off, the Committee may
cause shares of Grant Stock to be distributed to his Beneficiary or
Beneficiaries. The distribution shall be made within 90 days after the
Participant's death.
         Each Participant, upon notification of his participation in the Plan,
shall file with the Committee a designation of a Beneficiary to whom
distributions otherwise due the Participant shall be made in the event of his
death prior to the distribution of the amount credited to his Accounts in the
Foreign Deferred Compensation Ledger. The designation will be effective upon
receipt by the Committee of a properly executed form which the Committee has
approved for that purpose. The Participant may from time to time revoke or
change any designation of Beneficiary by filing another approved Beneficiary
designation form with the Committee. If there is no valid designation of
Beneficiary on file with the Committee at the time of the Participant's death,
or if all of the Beneficiaries designated in the last Beneficiary designation
have predeceased the Participant or otherwise ceased to exist, the Beneficiary
will be the Participant's spouse, if the spouse survives the Participant, or
otherwise the Participant's estate.
        6.2 DISABILITY. Upon the Disability of a Participant, the Participant
shall receive the value of the amounts credited to the Participant's Accounts
in the Foreign Deferred Compensation Ledger determined under Section 6.7, and
the distribution shall be made in shares of Common Stock.

                                      VI-1

<PAGE>
Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that shares of Grant Stock were
deemed credited to the Participant's Account in connection with the Grant
Spin-Off, the Committee may cause shares of Grant Stock to be distributed to
him. The distribution shall be made within 90 days after the Participant
becomes disabled.
        6.3 RETIREMENT. Upon the Retirement of a Participant on or after
attaining age 60, the Participant shall receive the value of the amounts
credited to his Accounts in the Foreign Deferred Compensation Ledger determined
under Section 6.7, and the distribution shall be made in shares of Common
Stock. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that shares of Grant Stock
were deemed credited to the Participant's Account in connection with the Grant
Spin-Off, the Committee may cause shares of Grant Stock to be distributed to
him. The distribution shall be made within 90 days after the Participant's
Retirement.
        6.4 TERMINATION PRIOR TO DEATH, DISABILITY OR RETIREMENT. Upon a
Participant's termination from the employ of all Companies prior to death,
Disability or Retirement, the Participant shall receive the portion of the
amount credited to his Accounts in the Foreign Deferred Compensation Ledger,
determined under Section 6.7, which is vested under Article V, and the
distribution shall be made in Common Stock. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to
the extent that shares of Grant Stock were deemed credited to the Participant's
Account in connection with the Grant Spin-Off, the Committee may cause shares
of Grant Stock to be distributed to him. The distribution shall be made within
90 days after the Participant's termination. Any amounts not then vested shall
be forfeited.
        6.5 FORFEITURE FOR CAUSE. If the Committee finds, after full
consideration of the facts presented on behalf of both the Company and a former
Participant, that the Participant was discharged by the Company for fraud,
embezzlement, theft, commission of a felony, proven

                                      VI-2

<PAGE>
dishonesty in the course of his employment by the Company which damaged the
Company, or for disclosing trade secrets of the Company, the entire amount
credited to his Accounts in the Foreign Deferred Compensation Ledger shall be
forfeited even though it may have been previously vested under Article V. The
decision of the Committee as to the cause of a former Participant's discharge
and the damage done to the Company shall be final. No decision of the Committee
shall affect the finality of the discharge of the Participant by the Company in
any manner.
        6.6 RESPONSIBILITY FOR DISTRIBUTIONS AND WITHHOLDING OF TAXES. The
Committee shall furnish information to the Company last employing the
Participant concerning the amount and form of distribution to any Participant
entitled to a distribution so that the Company may make the distribution
required. It will also calculate the deductions, if any, from the amount of the
benefit paid under the Plan for any taxes required to be withheld by any
government or similar authority and will cause them to be withheld and paid to
the appropriate authority. If a Participant earns deferred compensation under
the Plan while in the service of more than one Company, each Company for which
the Participant worked shall pay the amount attributable to the period the
Participant was in the service of that Company.
        6.7 DISTRIBUTION DETERMINATION DATE. For purposes of all distributions
described in this Article VI, the determination date shall be the date of the
actual distribution to the Participant or his Beneficiary, and the number of
shares issued shall be equal to the vested non-monetary units credited to the
Participant's Accounts.
         6.8 RESERVATION OF SHARES. A total of 100,000 shares of Common Stock
have been reserved for issuance for distributions under the Plan.

         efficient administration of the Plan.
        7.4 COMMITTEE DISCRETION. The Committee in exercising any power or
authority granted under the Plan or in making any determination under the Plan

                            ADOPTION BY SUBSIDIARIES

        8.1 PROCEDURE FOR AND STATUS AFTER ADOPTION. Any Subsidiary may, with
the approval of the Committee, adopt the Plan by appropriate action of its
board of directors. The terms of the Plan will apply separately to each
Subsidiary adopting the Plan and its Participants in the same manner as is
expressly provided for Weatherford and its Participants except that the powers
of the Board of Directors and the Committee under the Plan shall be exercised
by the Board of Directors of Weatherford alone. Weatherford and each Subsidiary
that adopts the Plan shall bear the cost of providing plan benefits for its own
Participants. It is intended that the obligation of Weatherford and each
Subsidiary with respect to its Participants shall be the sole obligation of the
company that is employing the Participant and shall not bind any other company.
        8.2 TERMINATION OF PARTICIPATION BY ADOPTING SUBSIDIARY. Any Subsidiary
that adopts the Plan may, by appropriate action of its board of directors,
terminate its participation in the Plan. The Committee may, in its discretion,
also terminate a Subsidiary's participation in the Plan at any time. The
termination of the participation in the Plan by a Subsidiary shall not,
however, affect the rights of any Participant who is working or has worked for
the Subsidiary as to amounts and/or units previously standing to his credit in
his Accounts in the Foreign Deferred Compensation Ledger.

                          AMENDMENT AND/OR TERMINATION

        9.1 AMENDMENT OR TERMINATION OF THE PLAN. The Board of Directors may
amend or terminate the Plan at any time by an instrument in writing without the
consent of any adopting Company or any Participant.
        9.2 NO RETROACTIVE EFFECT ON AWARDED BENEFITS. No amendment shall
affect the rights of any Participant to the amounts and/or units then standing
to his credit in his Accounts in the Foreign Deferred Compensation Ledger.
However, the Board of Directors shall retain the right to change at any time
and in any manner the method of calculating all Basic Benefits to be accrued in
the future, and the gauge to be used to determine future increases or decreases
in amounts accrued after the date of the amendment.
        9.3 EFFECT OF TERMINATION. If the Plan is terminated, all amounts of
Basic Benefits accrued by the Company and credited to a Participant's Accounts
shall immediately vest as if the Participant were entitled to and did retire on
the date the Plan terminated. Distribution would then commence in accordance
with Section 6.3. However, the forfeiture provisions of Section 6.5 would
continue to apply until the actual date of distribution.

                                    PAYMENT

         10.1 PAYMENTS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT ARE THE OBLIGATION OF THE COMPANY.
The Company shall be liable for all benefits due the Participants under the
Plan.
       10.2 PARTICIPANTS MUST RELY ONLY ON GENERAL CREDIT OF THE COMPANY. The
Plan is only a general corporate commitment and that each Participant must rely
upon the general credit of the Company for the fulfillment of its obligations
under the Plan. Under all circumstances, the rights of Participants to any
asset held by the Company shall be no greater than the rights expressed in this
agreement. Nothing contained in the Plan shall constitute a guarantee by the
Company that the assets of the Company will be sufficient to pay any benefits
under the Plan or would place the Participant in a secured position ahead of
general creditors and judgment creditors of the Company.

                                 MISCELLANEOUS

         11.1 LIMITATION OF RIGHTS. Nothing in the Plan will be construed:
                  (a) to give any employee of any Company any right to be
         designated a Participant in the Plan;
                  (b) to give a Participant any right with respect to the Basic
         Benefit accrued except in accordance with the terms of the Plan;
                  (c) to limit in any way the right of the Company to terminate
         a Participant's employment with the Company at any time;
                  (d) to evidence any agreement or understanding, expressed or
         implied, that the Company will employ a Participant in any particular
         position or for any particular remuneration; or
                  (e) to give a Participant or any other person claiming
         through him any interest or right under the Plan other than that of
         any unsecured general creditor of the Company.
       11.2 DISTRIBUTION TO MINOR OR INCAPACITATED PERSON. If the Committee
determines that any person to whom a payment is due is a minor or unable to
care for his affairs because of physical or mental disability, it shall have
the authority to cause his payments under the Plan to be made to his parent,
legal guardian, spouse, brother, sister or other person whom the Committee
determines.
 The Committee shall not be responsible to oversee the application of those
payments. Payments made pursuant to this power shall be a complete discharge of
all liability under the Plan and the obligations of the Company and the
Committee.

       11.3 NONALIENATION OF BENEFITS. No right or benefit provided in the Plan
shall be transferable by the Participant except, upon his death, to a named
Beneficiary as provided in the Plan. No right or benefit under the Plan shall
be subject to anticipation, alienation, sale, assignment, pledge, encumbrance
or charge, and any attempt to anticipate, alienate, sell, assign, pledge,
encumber, or charge the same shall be void. No right or benefit under the Plan
shall in any manner be liable for or subject to any debts, contracts,
liabilities or torts of the person entitled to such benefits. If any
Participant or any Beneficiary becomes bankrupt or attempts to anticipate,
alienate, sell, assign, pledge, encumber or charge any right or benefit under
the Plan, that right or benefit shall, in the discretion of the Committee,
cease. In that event, the Committee may have the Company hold or apply the
right or benefit or any part of it to the benefit of the Participant or
Beneficiary, his or her spouse, children or other dependents or any of them in
any manner and in any proportion the Committee believes to be proper in its
sole and absolute discretion, but is not required to do so.
       11.4 RELIANCE UPON INFORMATION. The Committee shall not be liable for
any decision or action taken in good faith in connection with the
administration of the Plan. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
any decision or action taken by the Committee when it relies upon information
supplied it by any officer of the Company, the Company's legal counsel, the
Company's independent accountants or other advisors in connection with the
administration of the Plan shall be deemed to have been taken in good faith.
       11.5 SEVERABILITY. If any term, provision, covenant or condition of the
Plan is held to be invalid, void or otherwise unenforceable, the rest of the
Plan shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected,
impaired or invalidated.
         11.6 NOTICE. Any notice or filing required or permitted to be given to
the Committee or a Participant shall be sufficient if in writing and hand
delivered or sent by mail (postage prepaid) to

                                      XI-2
<PAGE>
the principal office of the Company or to the residential mailing address of
the Participant. Notice shall be deemed to be given as of the date of hand
delivery or if delivery is by mail, as of the date shown on the postmark.
       11.7 GENDER AND NUMBER. If the context requires it, words of one gender
when used in the Plan will include the other genders, and words used in the
singular or plural will include the other.
         11.8 GOVERNING LAW. The Plan will be construed, administered and
governed in all respects by the laws of the State of Texas, United States of
America.
