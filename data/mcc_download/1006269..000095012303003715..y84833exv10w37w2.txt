it is acknowledged may involve a new beneficiary) and in the same (or a lesser)
amount as, such expiring or terminated Letter of Credit, and if such replacement
Letter of Credit is issued concurrently with such expiration or termination, the
total Revolving Credit Commitments shall not be reduced on account of such
expiration or termination other than by an amount, if any, equal to the
difference between the amount of the expiring or terminated Letter of Credit and

         SECTION 4. Financial Advisor; Meetings and Other Communications. (a)

successor financial advisor engaged as contemplated hereby, the "FINANCIAL
ADVISOR") to assist Loral and its Subsidiaries, including the Borrower, in a
review of their businesses and finances and an assessment of strategic
alternatives, including asset sales and other actions to reduce indebtedness.
The Borrower covenants that Loral will maintain such engagement, with a scope of
work as set forth in the Greenhill & Co., LLC engagement letter previously
delivered to the Administrative Agent, or, if for any reason Greenhill & Co.,
LLC ceases to be engaged as the Financial Advisor, Loral will promptly engage a
successor Financial Advisor of recognized national standing, reasonably
satisfactory to a majority of the Steering Committee, with a similar scope of
work.

         (b) The Borrower agrees that senior management of Loral will be
available, at such times and as often as reasonably requested by the
Administrative Agent (which may be monthly or more frequently), to attend
meetings or participate in conference calls with the Administrative Agent, E&Y,
the Steering Committee or the Banks (and will arrange for the Financial Advisor
to be present and available to answer questions at such times), during which
there will be reports in reasonable detail on the Borrower's recent results of
operations and current financial condition and the current status of its
business and affairs and the status and any results to date or conclusions (even
if preliminary and subject to change or encompassing a range of alternatives) of
the strategic review referred to in Section 4(a). Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Borrower agrees that it will have a meeting in
New York City to which all of the Banks are invited no later than July 1, 2003,
on a date to be mutually agreed with the Administrative Agent, at which senior
management of Loral and the Financial Advisor will make a detailed presentation
concerning (i) the Updated Business Plan, including a description in reasonable
detail of the assumptions and other basis for the budget and financial
projections included therein and an explanation in reasonable detail of any
variances from the Initial Business Plan, and (ii) the status and any results to
date or conclusions (even if preliminary and subject to change or encompassing a
range of alternatives) of the review referred to in Section 4(a). A written
report setting forth the details of such presentation will be

                                       4
<PAGE>
delivered to the Administrative Agent for distribution to the Banks no later
than three Business Days prior to the date of such meeting.

         (c) The Borrower also agrees that within 45 days after the Amendment
Effective Date Loral will hire a new senior financial officer. The new senior
financial officer shall be a person with significant senior financial management
experience, and specifically shall have experience in situations involving an
assessment of strategic alternatives, including asset sales and other actions to
reduce indebtedness. Loral will consult with the Steering Committee during the
process of selecting this officer and will review the proposed candidate with
the Steering Committee, and the person hired, as well as the responsibilities
and authority he will be given shall be subject to the reasonable approval of a
majority of the Steering Committee. The new senior financial officer shall work
closely with and support the Financial Advisor. The new senior financial officer
shall also participate in reporting to and communicating with the Administrative
Agent, the Steering Committee and the Banks. The new senior financial officer
will work closely with other senior management of Loral, including the Chief
Executive Officer, but will report directly to the Board of Directors of Loral.

         SECTION 7. Other Modifications of the Credit Agreement. The Borrower

follows:

         (a) The definition of "Consolidated EBITDA" in the Credit Agreement is
amended to replace clause (ii) to read as follows: "(ii) any management fee
(other than the management fee or reimbursement of management expenses due to
the Borrower from the Parent and/or Loral Satellite, Inc.) or lease income from
other Affiliates not paid in cash within 90 days".

         (b) The following definition for "Net Cash Proceeds" is hereby added to
Section 1.1 of the Credit Agreement, and all references in the Credit Agreement
to "net cash proceeds" and "net after-tax cash proceeds" shall be replaced with
this defined term:

         "NET CASH PROCEEDS": (a) with respect to any Indebtedness, the gross
cash proceeds from the incurrence, issuance or sale by the Borrower or any
Subsidiary of such Indebtedness, net of all taxes (including taxes estimated by
the Borrower to be payable as a result thereof or as a result of such
transactions) and fees (including investment banking fees), commissions, costs
and other expenses incurred in connection with such issuance or sale and (b)
with respect to any asset sale, the gross proceeds thereof in the form of cash
and Cash Equivalents (including any such proceeds received by way of purchase
price adjustment receivable or otherwise, but only as and when received) of such
asset sale, net of attorneys' fees, accountants' fees, investment banking fees,
and other customary fees and expenses actually incurred in connection therewith
and net of taxes paid or reasonably estimated to be payable as a result thereof
(after taking into account any available tax credits or deductions and any tax
sharing arrangements).

         (c) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 1.2(b) of the Credit
Agreement, all calculations made for the purposes of determining compliance with
the Credit Agreement shall be made by application of GAAP as in effect for and
applied in the preparation of the Borrower's financial statements dated as of
and for the period ended September 30, 2001.

         (d) The provisions of Section 5.3(c) of the Credit Agreement are
superceded by the following sentence. If and for so long as any Event of Default
has occurred and is continuing, all Loans, and reimbursement obligations and all
fees and other amounts payable by the Borrower or any Guarantor not paid when
due, shall bear interest at, after as well as before judgment, and all fees in
respect

                                       7
<PAGE>
of Letters of Credit shall be equal to, a rate per annum equal to (i) in the
case of principal of any Loan or reimbursement obligation or any fee in respect
of a Letter of Credit, 2% plus the rate otherwise applicable to such Loan,
reimbursement obligation or Letter of Credit and (ii) in the case of any other
amount, 2% plus the rate applicable to Base Rate Loans.

         (e) In Section 5.4(a) of the Credit Agreement, when the applicable Base
Rate is based on the Federal Funds Rate, interest will be calculated on the
basis of a 360-day year for the actual days elapsed.

         (f) In Section 5.13 of the Credit Agreement, the following provisions
shall apply, and to the extent inconsistent the provisions of Section 5.13 shall
be superceded:

                  (i) In Section 5.13(c)(III), clause (iii) of the proviso is
         deleted. But if the aggregate principal amount of Loans required to be
         repaid on any date pursuant to Section 5.13(c)(III) is less than
         $1,000,000, such prepayment shall be deferred until the aggregate
         principal amount of Loans required to be prepaid pursuant thereto
         (including such deferred amount) is not less than $1,000,000 or, if
         earlier, the date any other prepayment of Loans is required to be made
         pursuant to Section 5.13.

                  (ii) In Section 5.13(e), all net insurance proceeds
         (including, subject to the second sentence of this Section 7(f)(ii),
         net of payments out of such proceeds used to pay required warranty
         claims pursuant to existing agreements with third parties) in excess of
         $3,000,000 received on account of any claim or related group of claims
         that is based on the same event with respect to any satellite or
         transponder owned by the Borrower or its Subsidiaries in respect of its
         fixed satellite services business (including without limitation, for
         any launch failure, any in-orbit failure (whether total or partial) or
         any anomaly or degradation) shall be used to prepay the Term Loans and
         reduce the Revolving Credit Commitments in accordance with Section
         5.13, and the proviso in Section 5.13(e) shall not apply to any such
         proceeds. It is understood and agreed by the Borrower that the
         insurance proceeds to be used to pay the required warranty claims
         described in the previous sentence shall be placed in an escrow account
         established on terms satisfactory to the Administrative Agent
         immediately upon receipt of such insurance proceeds and kept in such
         account until payment is made on such warranty claims, and any such
         amounts not applied to such warranty claims within 60 days after
         receipt of such proceeds shall no longer be excluded for purposes of
         this Section 7(f)(ii), and shall be immediately applied to prepay the
         Term Loans and reduce the Revolving Credit Commitments in accordance
         with Section 5.13.

         If any such prepayment is made and involves circumstances in which any
         satellite or transponder has been destroyed or permanently failed or as
         to which there is an anomaly as to a portion thereof, the Borrower, by
         notice

                                       8
<PAGE>
         to the Administrative Agent with a copy to each Bank, may request that
         thereafter the requirements of any financial covenant that includes
         Consolidated EBITDA be re-calculated on a pro forma basis excluding the
         projected revenues (net of any related cost savings) that would have
         been derived from such satellite or transponder. Such notice shall
         include in reasonable detail the basis for, and the computations
         underlying, the re-calculation requested by the Borrower. The
         Administrative Agent and E&Y, in consultation with the Steering
         Committee, shall promptly review such request and advise the Borrower
         whether there are any disagreements with the proposed re-calculation,
         setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for any such disagreement.
         The Administrative Agent agrees to promptly negotiate in good faith
         with the Borrower to resolve any such disagreement, but no such
         re-calculation shall be given effect for purposes of determining the
         Borrower's compliance with any financial covenant until approved by a
         majority of the Steering Committee (it being acknowledged and agreed
         (x) by all parties hereto that any such recalculations approved by a
         majority of the Steering Committee shall be binding on all the Banks
         and effective for all purposes of the Credit Agreement and (y) by the
         Borrower that the Administrative Agent or the Steering Committee may
         consult with the Banks, and may take their views into account). The
         Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Banks of any such
         re-calculation approved by the Steering Committee.

         Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is agreed that insurance proceeds of
         $7,000,000 received by the Borrower on a conditional basis in respect
         of a claim submitted prior to the Amendment Effective Date regarding
         certain anomalies on Telstar 5 (the unconditional receipt of which is
         included in the Initial Business Plan) are not required to be used to
         prepay Loans or reduce the Revolving Credit Commitments, provided that
         (A) if the Borrower receives any additional insurance proceeds for such
         claim, 100% of such additional proceeds shall be used to prepay the
         Term Loans and reduce the Revolving Credit Commitments and,
         notwithstanding the immediately preceding paragraph, no re-calculation
         of the financial covenant calculations shall be allowed and (B) if any
         or all of such $7,000,000 of insurance proceeds is required to be
         repaid to the insurance company, no re-calculation or other adjustments
         of the financial covenant calculations is contemplated or will be
         allowed.

                  (iii) In Section 5.13(g), all mandatory prepayments applied to
         the Term Loans pursuant to Sections 5.13(c)(II) and (III), shall be
         applied pro rata to the remaining installments on the Term Loans (which
         for these and comparable applications includes the final installment at
         maturity).

         (g) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 8.1(a) of the Credit
Agreement, the financial statements for 2002 delivered pursuant to Section
8.1(a) need not set forth in comparative form the figures for the previous year.


                                       9
<PAGE>
         (h) As for Section 8.2(e) of the Credit Agreement, it is agreed that
the updated appraisals referred to therein for Telstar 4 and Telstar 5 may be
delivered at any time on or before April 30 of each year, notwithstanding the
date on which the Borrower delivers the financial statements referred to in
Section 8.1(a) and that the updated appraisals referred to therein for Telstar 8
and Telstar 13 may be delivered at any time on or before May 10, 2003.

         (i) Instead of the provisions of Section 9.1(d) and Schedule 9.1 of the
Credit Agreement, the Borrower and its Subsidiaries will be subject to the
following limitations on Capital Expenditures (it being agreed that for purposes
of this Section 7(i), Capital Expenditures shall not include any capitalized
interest):

                  (i) Capital Expenditures to complete construction of Telstar
         13, the EDS Satellite, Telstar 18 and Telstar 8 (all of which may be
         expended in 2003) are permitted in an aggregate amount for each such
         satellite not exceeding 105% of the projected amount therefor set forth
         in the Initial Business Plan, provided that cash Capital Expenditures
         for Telstar 18 are permitted only to the extent funded by a cash amount
         received from third parties in connection with the pre-funded launch
         deposits contributed by the Borrower.

                  (ii) Capital Expenditures for the launch and insurance of
         Telstar 13, the EDS Satellite and Telstar 18 (all of which may be
         expended in 2003) are permitted in an aggregate amount for each such
         satellite not exceeding 105% of the projected amount therefor set forth
         in the Initial Business Plan, provided that cash Capital Expenditures
         for the launch and insurance of Telstar 18 are permitted only to the
         extent funded by a cash amount received from third parties in
         connection with the pre-funded launch deposits contributed by the
         Borrower. No Capital Expenditures for the launch and insurance of
         Telstar 8 are permitted.

                  (iii) Capital Expenditures during fiscal year 2003 for all
         other purposes are limited to $20,000,000.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Orbitals Transaction (as defined in
Section 7(k)(vi)) does not close by June 30, 2003 with Net Cash Proceeds of at
least $55,000,000 to the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, no further Capital
Expenditures shall be permitted after such time without the approval of the
Required Banks, other than (x) Capital Expenditures of no more than $100,000 in
each month and (y) cash Capital Expenditures for Telstar 18 to the extent funded
by a cash amount received from third parties in connection with the pre-funded
launch deposits contributed by the Borrower.

         (j) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 9.2(h) and Section 9.2(i)
of the Credit Agreement, the Borrower agrees that on and after the Amendment
Effective Date it will not incur additional Indebtedness pursuant to Section
9.2(h) or Section 9.2(i) if, after giving effect thereto and to the repayment of
any other

                                       10
<PAGE>
Indebtedness incurred pursuant to Section 9.2(h) or 9.2(i) on or after the
Amendment Effective Date, the aggregate outstanding principal amount of
Indebtedness incurred pursuant to Section 9.2(h) or 9.2(i) on or after the
Amendment Effective Date would exceed $3,000,000, provided that any extension,
renewal, or replacement on or after the Amendment Effective Date of Indebtedness
incurred pursuant to Section 9.2(h) or 9.2(i) and outstanding on the Amendment
Effective Date shall be excluded from such calculation so long as the principal
amount of such Indebtedness is not increased.

         In addition, neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries will
incur any indebtedness relating to vendor financing ("VENDOR INDEBTEDNESS") on
or after the Amendment Effective Date unless, after giving effect thereto and
any repayment of any Vendor Indebtedness incurred on or after the Amendment
Effective Date the aggregate outstanding principal amount of Vendor Indebtedness
incurred on or after the Amendment Effective Date does not exceed (a)
$10,000,000 owing to any Person plus (b) $30,000,000 owing to subcontractors.

         (k) In Section 9.6 of the Credit Agreement, the following provisions
shall apply, and to the extent inconsistent the provisions of Section 9.6 shall
be superceded:

                  (i) Dispositions of obsolete, replaced, worn out or
         discontinued property shall be permitted pursuant to Section 9.6(b) (as
         distinct from being permitted pursuant to Section 9.6(k)) only to the
         extent done in the ordinary course of business.

                  (ii) For purposes of Sections 9.6(a), (b) or (d), any
         transaction or series of related transactions involving gross proceeds
         in excess of $5,000,000, other than sales or leases of inventory, will
         be deemed not in the ordinary course of business (it being understood
         and agreed that merely because any transaction or series of related
         transactions involves gross proceeds of $5,000,000 or less does not
         create a presumption that they are in the ordinary course of business).

                  (iii) Dispositions will be permitted pursuant to Section
         9.6(c) only if the replacement equipment is of similar use, provided
         that transactions in which launch deposits are directly or indirectly
         exchanged or otherwise applied to the acquisition of transponders will
         also be permitted pursuant to Section 9.6(c).

                  (iv) In Section 9.6(k), 100% rather than 80% of the sales
         proceeds must be paid in cash on the date of sale and clause (iii) is
         modified to read in its entirety as follows:

                           "the Term Loans are repaid and the Revolving Credit
                  Commitments are permanently reduced by an amount equal to the


                                       11
<PAGE>
                  Net Cash Proceeds of such sales in accordance with Section
                  5.13(c);".

                  (v) Pursuant to Section 9.6(l), the Borrower or the relevant
         Subsidiary may sell the assets of Loral Ecuador (renamed Earth Station
         Ecuador Cia Ltda.) as well as the Capital Stock of Loral Ecuador.

                  (vi) Notwithstanding the provisions of the Credit Agreement
         and this Amendment, the Borrower and its Subsidiaries may effect the
         monetization of certain Intelsat orbital receivables (the "ORBITALS
         TRANSACTION") and sell (publicly or privately) capital stock of Sirius
         Radio, Inc., in each case in transactions with substantially the same
         substance as previously described to the Administrative Agent but only
         if the proceeds of such transactions, in the good faith judgment of the
         Borrower, are fair market value. No prepayment of the Term Loans or
         permanent reduction of the Revolving Credit Commitments shall be
         required in connection with such transactions. It is acknowledged and
         agreed that (A) the cash escrow contemplated to be created in
         connection with the Orbitals Transaction to secure the Borrower's
         performance of its ongoing obligations to the purchaser of the related
         satellites is permitted by Section 9.3(d) and (B) notwithstanding that
         in accordance with GAAP the Borrower may be required to record
         Indebtedness on account of the Orbitals Transaction, such Indebtedness
         will be permitted to be incurred and will be disregarded for purposes
         of calculating compliance with any financial covenants, but only if
         under the terms of the Orbitals Transaction there is no recourse by the
         purchaser of such receivables (or any transferee) against the Borrower
         or any of its Subsidiaries in respect of any principal or interest
         element of the Orbitals Transaction (but there may be recourse with
         respect to usual and customary matters concerning ownership and
         transfer of the assets transferred and turnover of payments mistakenly
         paid to the Borrower after giving effect to the sale).

         (l) In Section 9.8 of the Credit Agreement, the following provisions
shall apply, and to the extent inconsistent the provisions of Section 9.8 shall
be superceded:

                  (i) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 9.8(a), the
         following restrictions shall apply to extensions of trade credit that
         are vendor financing (namely, extensions of credit to vendors that are
         not current trade liabilities incurred to the Borrower and its
         Subsidiaries on customary terms consistent with past practice, referred
         to as "VENDOR CREDIT"). Neither the Borrower nor any of its
         Subsidiaries will extend any Vendor Credit on or after the Amendment
         Effective Date (it being understood that the Vendor Credit to be
         provided to WildBlue Communications, Inc. ("WILDBLUE") pursuant to the
         Memorandum of Understanding dated March 7, 2003 between Space
         Systems/Loral, Inc. and WildBlue shall be treated as having been
         incurred prior to the

                                       12
<PAGE>
         Amendment Effective Date) unless such Vendor Credit arises in
         connection with new contracts for the manufacture of satellites and
         only if, after giving effect thereto and to the reduction of any other
         Vendor Credit extended on or after the Amendment Effective Date, the
         aggregate outstanding amount of Vendor Credit extended on or after the
         Amendment Effective Date would not exceed $150,000,000, no more than
         $50,000,000 of which is extended to any vendors that are not Investment
         Grade Vendors.

                  (ii) The reference to $5,000,000 in Section 9.8(c) is changed
         to $500,000.

                  (iii) The reference to $20 million in Section 9.8(j) of the
         Credit Agreement is changed to $2 million.

                  (iv) In addition to investments permitted to be made by the
         Borrower and its Subsidiaries pursuant to Section 9.8 as amended
         hereby, the Borrower and its Subsidiaries may directly or indirectly
         make advances, loans or other extensions of credit to, or investments
         in, Loral Skynet do Brasil Ltda. in an aggregate outstanding amount not
         exceeding $3,000,000 to fund the operating costs of such Affiliate in
         connection with the EDS Satellite.

                  (v) In addition to investments permitted to be made by the
         Borrower and its Subsidiaries pursuant to Section 9.8 as amended
         hereby, the Borrower may create a Domestic Subsidiary (which may be a
         special purpose, so-called bankruptcy remote entity) and transfer to it
         (or an existing Domestic Subsidiary) an amount of money not exceeding
         the amount included in the budget reflected in the Initial Business
         Plan for 2003 renewal premiums for officers' and directors' insurance
         for Loral and its Subsidiaries (which amount the Borrower hereby
         confirms is $2,700,000), with such moneys to be used solely for payment
         of amounts that would otherwise have been covered by such insurance
         (ignoring deductibles), it being agreed by the Borrower that if it
         makes such transfer it will be doing so in lieu of paying such
         premiums, unless subsequent thereto such transfer is reversed. The
         Borrower shall not be required to cause such Domestic Subsidiary to
         become a Guarantor (and its Consolidated Net Worth shall be excluded
         from any calculation pursuant to Section 8.9(a) of the Credit
         Agreement) and such Domestic Subsidiary shall not be required to pledge
         collateral interests in its property pursuant to Section 8.10 of the
         Credit Agreement, but the Borrower agrees that within 45 days following
         any such transfer it will cause all of the capital stock of such
         Domestic Subsidiary to be pledged to the Joint Collateral Agent
         pursuant to the Collateral Documents as contemplated by Section 8.9(a)
         of the Credit Agreement. It is also agreed that the transactions
         contemplated by this clause (v) shall not be a violation of Section 9.9
         of the Credit Agreement.


                                       13
<PAGE>
         (m) Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 9.6 and 9.9 of the
Credit Agreement and any other applicable provisions of the Credit Agreement,
the Borrower and its Subsidiaries will be permitted (i) to enter into a
settlement agreement with Globalstar, L.P. and certain other parties
substantially on the terms set forth in the Loral/Globalstar Settlement Term
Sheet dated as of March 14, 2003 previously delivered to the Administrative
Agent, and (ii) to perform its obligations thereunder.

         (n) Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries will agree to or
make transponder lease payments to Loral CyberStar, Inc. other than at rates and
on other terms consistent with historical practice.

         (o) Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries will (i) make any
optional prepayment, retirement or redemption of, or other optional purchase,
payment or defeasance in respect of, any of their Funded Debt, other than the
Obligations and any such prepayment, retirement, redemption, purchase or payment
effected solely in exchange for issuance of shares of capital stock of Loral, no
portion of which matures or is subject to mandatory redemption or repurchase,
whether or not upon the happening of any event or the election of the holder, at
any time prior to July 7, 2005, or (ii) enter into or agree to any amendment to
the terms of any other Funded Debt that would (A) increase the rate of interest
or fees payable in respect thereof, (B) cause the principal thereof to be
repayable, defeased, redeemed or otherwise retired earlier or on stricter terms
or, in the case of any revolving facility, the commitments or availability
thereunder to be reduced, (C) require any additional collateral to be pledged or
(D) add additional events of default.

         (p) In Sections 10(f) and 10(g) of the Credit Agreement, all references
to the Borrower or any of its Material Subsidiaries are expanded to include also
Loral, the Parent and Loral Satellite, Inc., provided that (i) in the case of
Loral Satellite, Inc., the reference to $15,000,000 shall be changed to
$1,000,000 and (ii) in the case of Loral, the limitation of 30 days on the grace
period provided in the applicable instrument or agreement shall be deleted.

         (q) In Section 12.6(c) of the Credit Agreement, (i) the universe of
Purchasing Banks is expanded to any bank, finance company, insurance company or
other financial institution or fund that in the ordinary course of business
extends credit or buys loans of the type contemplated by the Credit Agreement,
(ii) the consent of the Borrower shall not be required for a sale to a
Purchasing Bank regardless of whether a Default or Event of Default exists at
the time of such sale, nor shall its execution of a Commitment Transfer
Supplement be required pursuant to Section 12.6(e) of the Credit Agreement, but
the Borrower shall still be entitled to receive notice of such sale pursuant to
Section 12.6(e) and (iii) in the case of a sale by a Revolving Credit Bank of
all or any part of its rights and obligations as a Revolving Credit Bank to a
Purchasing Bank that is already a Bank but is not a Revolving Credit Bank, the
consent of the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Bank shall be required, such
consents not to be unreasonably

                                       14
<PAGE>
withheld (it being understood that in any such instance the Purchasing Bank may
be required to demonstrate to the reasonable satisfaction of the Administrative
Agent and the Issuing Bank its legal and financial ability to timely perform its
obligations in respect of its Revolving Credit Commitment).

         SECTION 8. Miscellaneous Provisions. (a) The Banks party hereto
acknowledge and agree that the Borrower will be agreeing for the benefit of the
lenders under the Satellite Credit Agreement that in sub-leasing transponders
pursuant to the Master Lease Agreement, it will continue to follow historical
practice in allocating business to particular satellites.

         (b) The Borrower acknowledges that (i) Ernst & Young Corporate Finance
LLC has been engaged in connection with the Credit Agreement as contemplated by
the definition of "E&Y" and (ii) the Steering Committee has been formed. Without
limiting the generality of Section 12.5 of the Credit Agreement, the Borrower
agrees that it will pay, promptly after receipt, all statements for fees and
expenses (which may include amounts on account) of any financial, accounting or
valuation advisors or counsel retained by the Administrative Agent (or through
counsel to the Administrative Agent) in connection with matters arising in
relation to the Credit Agreement (including E&Y and Davis Polk & Wardwell) and
all invoices from any member of the Steering Committee for reimbursement of its
out-of-pocket expenses (other than for legal counsel or other advisors) incurred
in connection with serving as a member of the Steering Committee. The Banks
party hereto agree that the Borrower's obligations under this provision and
Section 12.5 of the Credit Agreement may be, and the Borrower hereby agrees that
such obligations shall be, joint and several with the obligations of Loral
Satellite, Inc. to pay the same amounts.

         (c) The Borrower agrees that this Amendment shall be considered a "Loan
Document" for all purposes of the Credit Agreement, including without limitation
Section 10(e).

         (d) The Borrower understands and accepts that:

                  (i) except as expressly set forth herein, this Amendment shall
         not constitute a waiver or amendment of any term or condition of the
         Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document and all such terms and
         conditions shall remain in full force and effect and are hereby
         ratified and confirmed in all respects, and that no failure or delay by
         the Banks or any one of them in exercising any right, power or
         privilege under any Loan Document, or any other action taken or not
         taken or statement made, during the period prior to the date hereof or
         during the period thereafter shall operate as a waiver thereof or
         obligate any Bank to agree to any further amendments to or waivers
         under any Loan Document; and


                                       15
<PAGE>
                  (ii) the Banks have given no assurance that they will grant
         any further amendments to the Credit Agreement or any other Loan
         Document.

         SECTION 9. Release of Bank Liability. The Borrower, for itself and on
behalf of its affiliated entities, successors, assigns and legal representatives
(the "BORROWER Parties"), jointly and severally releases, acquits and forever
discharges the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and each Bank
(collectively, the "BANK PARTIES"), and their respective subsidiaries, parents,
affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys, successors and
assigns, both present and former (collectively, the "BANKS' AFFILIATES") from
any and all manner of actions, causes of action, suits, debts, controversies,
damages, judgments, executions, claims and demands whatsoever, asserted or
unasserted, in contract, tort, law or equity which the Borrower or any other
Borrower Party has or may have against any of the Bank Parties and/or the Banks'
Affiliates by reason of any action, failure to act, matter or thing whatsoever
arising from or based on facts occurring prior to the date hereof, including but
not limited to any claim or defense that relates to, in whole or in part,
directly or indirectly, (i) the making or administration of the Loans, including
without limitation, any such claims and defenses based on fraud, mistake,
duress, usury or misrepresentation, or any other claim based on so-called
"lender liability theories", (ii) any covenants, agreements, duties or
obligations set forth in the Loan Documents, (iii) any actions or omissions of
any of the Bank Parties and/or the Banks' Affiliates in connections with the
initiation or continuing exercise of any right or remedy contained in the Loan
Documents or at law or in equity, (iv) lost profits, (v) loss of business
opportunity, (vi) increased financing costs, (vii) increased legal or other
administrative fees or (viii) damages to business reputation.

         SECTION 10. Interest and Additional Fees. (a) The Borrower agrees that
on and after the Amendment Effective Date, (i) the Applicable Eurodollar Rate
Margin for each day will be 3.75% and the Applicable Base Rate Margin for each
day will be 2.75% (including for purposes of any outstanding Interest Periods),
regardless of the Applicable Level, provided that both Applicable Margins are
subject to further increase as provided in the last sentence of the definition
of Applicable Margin in the Credit Agreement and (ii) the Eurodollar Rate used
to calculate the rate of interest applicable for any Interest Period (including,
as to any day on or after the Amendment Effective Date, for purposes of any
outstanding Interest Period) shall be the greater of (A) the rate otherwise
determined for such Interest Period pursuant to the definition of "Eurodollar
Rate" and (B) 1.50%. The Borrower agrees that on and after the Amendment
Effective Date it will not select any Interest Period that is longer than three
months.

         (b) In addition to the fees payable by the Borrower to the Banks
pursuant to Section 14(b), the Borrower agrees that if the Amendment Effective
Date occurs the Banks will on the Amendment Effective Date have earned, and the
Company shall be obligated to pay to the Administrative Agent for the

                                       16
<PAGE>
account of the Banks ratably in proportion to their outstanding Loans and
Revolving Credit Letters of Credit Obligations determined as of the Amendment
Effective Date (the "AMENDMENT DATE AMOUNT"), additional fees (the "ADDITIONAL
FEES") in an aggregate amount equal to 0.75% of the Amendment Date Amount. The
Additional Fees shall be payable on January 10, 2004. If any Bank assigns any of
its rights in respect of its Loans and Revolving Credit Commitments, a
proportionate amount of the Additional Fees earned by and payable to such Bank
shall be payable to the assignee thereof as of the day the Additional Fees are
payable. The obligation of the Borrower to pay the Additional Fees has been
imposed as a condition to this Amendment by the Required Banks expressly on the
basis that, being required only by a vote of the Required Banks, it is not
intended to be and shall not be a fee for purposes of clause (a) of Section 12.1
of the Credit Agreement, and accordingly the amount thereof may be reduced and
the date for payment thereof may be extended with the consent of the Required
Banks.

         SECTION 11. Representations of the Borrower. The Borrower represents
and warrants that, except as expressly waived hereby, (i) the representations
and warranties of the Borrower set forth in Article 6 of the Credit Agreement
will be true on and as of the Amendment Effective Date, except where such
representations and warranties expressly relate to an earlier date, in which
case such representation and warranty shall be true and correct as of such
earlier date and except as provided in Section 2(c) of the Amendment and (ii) no
Default will have occurred and be continuing on such date. The Borrower further
represents and warrants that:

         (a) all information (other than projections) heretofore furnished by or
on behalf of the Borrower to the Administrative Agent or any Bank for purposes
of or in connection with this Amendment does not, and all such information
hereafter furnished by or on behalf of the Borrower to the Administrative Agent
or any Bank will not, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact necessary in order to make statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they were or will be made, not misleading; and

         (b) the projections upon which the Initial Business Plan was and the
Updated Business Plan will be based and any similar information provided in
writing to the Banks by or on behalf of the Borrower pursuant to the Credit
Agreement or this Amendment will in each case be based upon good faith estimates
and assumptions believed by the Borrower's and Loral's senior management to be
reasonable at the time delivered and at the time prepared and delivered
represent their reasonable best estimate of the future performance of the

         SECTION 13. Counterparts. This Amendment may be signed in any number of
counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the
signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.

         SECTION 14. Effectiveness. (a) This Amendment shall become effective as
of the date hereof on the date when the following conditions are met (the
"AMENDMENT EFFECTIVE Date"):

                  (i) the Administrative Agent shall have received from each of
         the Borrower, each Guarantor and the Required Banks a counterpart
         hereof signed by such party or facsimile or other written confirmation
         (in form satisfactory to the Administrative Agent) that such party has
         signed a counterpart hereof;

                  (ii) confirmation that the Borrower has paid all statements of
         Davis Polk & Wardwell, special counsel for the Administrative Agent,
         and of E&Y that have been rendered to the Borrower at least one
         Business Day prior to the Amendment Effective Date in respect of this
         Amendment or other Credit Agreement matters;

                  (iii) the Parent and the Joint Collateral Agent shall have
         entered into the Satellite Pledge Agreement (which shall be, mutatis
         mutandis, substantially in the form of the Pledge Agreement), pursuant
         to which the Parent grants a pledge and security interest in the
         Satellite Stock to the Joint Collateral Agent, subject to the Second
         Intercreditor Agreement (which shall be, mutatis mutandis,
         substantially in the form of the Intercreditor Agreement);

                  (iv) the Administrative Agent shall have received a letter
         from the Borrower, in form and substance satisfactory to it, with
         respect to its fees and expenses for acting as Administrative Agent in
         connection with this Amendment and on and after the Amendment Effective
         Date, together with payment of any amounts due thereunder on the
         Amendment Effective Date.

                  (v) the Administrative Agent shall have received such opinions
         of counsel, officer's and secretary's certificates and such other
         documents relating to the Borrower, the Guarantors and the matters
         contemplated hereby as it shall have reasonably requested.

The Banks party hereto and the Borrower acknowledge that the granting to the
Joint Collateral Agent of a lien on the Satellite Stock pursuant to the
Satellite Pledge Agreement requires the consent of the Majority Lenders (as such
term is defined in the Satellite Credit Agreement), and the Borrower
acknowledges that if such consent is not provided by such lenders under the
Satellite Credit Agreement, it will not be able to satisfy the condition set
forth in clause (iii) of this Section 14(a).


                                       18

Promptly upon the occurrence of the Amendment Effective Date, the Administrative
Agent shall notify each of the parties hereto, and such notice shall be
conclusive and binding on all parties hereto.

         (b) No later than the first Business Day after the Amendment Effective
Date the Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent, in immediately
available funds, for the account of each Bank that has evidenced its agreement
hereto as provided above by the later of (i) Noon (New York City time) on March
31, 2003 and (ii) 5:00 PM (New York City time) on the date the Administrative
Agent issues a notice to the Banks saying that the Amendment Effective Date has
occurred, a waiver fee in an amount equal to 0.25% of such Bank's Amendment Date
Amount; provided that the date and time by which a Bank's evidence of its
agreement must be made in order to be entitled to receive such fee may be
extended, on a uniform basis for all Banks, to such later date and time as the
Borrower may agree.

         (c) Each Guarantor, by its signature below, hereby consents to this
Amendment and acknowledges that this Amendment shall not alter, release,
discharge or otherwise affect any of its obligations under the Credit Agreement
or any other Loan Document, and hereby ratifies and confirms all of the Loan
Documents to which it is a party.
