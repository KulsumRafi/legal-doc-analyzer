2.       THE FACILITIES

2.1      Grant of the Facilities
         Upon the terms and subject to the conditions hereof, the Revolving
         Banks have granted to the Borrowers the Revolving Facility and the
         Term Banks have granted to the Post-Novation Borrower the Term
         Facility (which is fully drawn), in each case, as the same may be
         reduced in accordance with the terms hereof provided that no Borrower
         organised under the laws of any state of the United States of America
         may borrow any amount under the Revolving Facility unless New NTL
         gives its prior written consent to such borrowing.

2.2      Purpose
         2.2.1    The Revolving Facility is intended to be used by the
                  Borrowers:

                  (a)       to finance the working capital requirements of the
                            UK Group; and

                  (b)       to finance, or refinance, Permitted Acquisitions;
                            and

                                     -51-
<page>

                  (c)       to finance Asset Adjustment Payments.

         2.2.2    The Term Facility was intended, and was applied, by the
                  Post-Novation Borrower to refinance amounts outstanding
                  under the Revolving Facility.

2.3      Application
         2.3.1    Each Borrower shall apply all amounts raised by it under the
                  Revolving Facility in or towards satisfaction of the
                  purposes specified in sub-clause 2.2.1 of Clause 2.2
                  (Purpose).

         2.3.2    The Post-Novation Borrower has applied all amounts raised by
                  it under the Term Facility in or towards satisfaction of the
                  purposes specified in sub-clause 2.2.2 of Clause 2.2
                  (Purpose).

         2.3.3    None of the Finance Parties shall be obliged to concern
                  itself with such aforementioned application.

2.4      Initial Conditions Precedent
         2.4.1    The conditions precedent to the initial availability of the
                  Revolving Facility (being the documents and other evidence
                  listed in Schedule 3 (Initial Revolving Bank Conditions
                  Precedent)) have been satisfied.

         2.4.2    The condition precedent to the initial availability of the
                  Term Facility and the amendment and restatement of this
                  Agreement pursuant to the First Restatement Amendment
                  Agreement (being the occurrence of the Term Effective Date)
                  has been satisfied.

2.5      Banks' Obligations Several
         The obligations of each Bank are several and the failure by a Bank to
         perform its obligations hereunder shall not affect the obligations of
         an Obligor towards any other party hereto nor shall any other party
         be liable for the failure by such Bank to perform its obligations
         hereunder.

2.6      Banks' Rights Several
         The rights of each Bank are several and any debt arising hereunder at
         any time from an Obligor to any of the other parties hereto shall be
         a separate and independent debt. Each such party shall, save as
         otherwise provided in this Agreement, the Security Trust Agreement
         and the Second Security Trust Agreement, be entitled to protect and
         enforce its individual rights arising out of this Agreement
         independently of any other party (so that it shall not be necessary
         for any party hereto to be joined as an additional party in any
         proceedings for this purpose).

2.7      Acknowledgement of Second Security
         The Revolving Banks acknowledge that, notwithstanding that the
         Security covers the Term Loan and the Term Banks, the Term Banks have
         also taken the security constituted by, or pursuant to, the Second
         Security Documents. Each party hereto undertakes that it will not at
         any time bring any legal action to challenge the validity or
         effectiveness of any of the security purported to be created under or
         pursuant to any Security Document or Second Security Document.
         Further, and for the avoidance of doubt, the Term Banks acknowledge
         (for the purposes of section 94 of the Law of Property Act, 1925)
         that,

                                     -52-
<page>

         notwithstanding the Second Security, all Advances made by the Banks
         from time to time are intended to have the benefit of the Security
         which ranks in priority to the Second Security given in respect of
         the Term Advances.

         3.1.3    the proposed amount of such Revolving Advance is (a) if less
                  than the Available Revolving Facility an amount or integral

                  the Available Revolving Facility;

         3.1.4    there would not, immediately after the making of such a
                  Revolving Advance, be more than ten Revolving Advances
                  outstanding;

         3.1.5    save for Rollover Advances, neither of the events mentioned
                  in sub-clauses 8.1.1 and 8.1.2 of 8.1 (Market Disruption)
                  shall have occurred;

                  Revolving Banks) may agree in each case ending on or before
                  the Revolving Termination Date; and

         3.1.7    on and as of the proposed date for the making of such
                  Revolving Advance:

                  (a)       in the case of Revolving Advances (other than
                            Rollover Advances), (i) no Event of Default or
                            Potential Event of Default is continuing and (ii)
                            the Repeated Representations are true in all
                            material respects; and

                  (b)       in the case of Rollover Advances (i) no Event of
                            Default is continuing and (ii) those of the
                            Repeated Representations which are not capable of
                            remedy or change if incorrect or misleading in any
                            material respect, are true in all material
                            respects.

3.2      Each Revolving Bank's Participation in Revolving Advances
         Each Revolving Bank will participate through its Facility Office in
         each Revolving Advance made pursuant to this Clause 3 in the
         proportion borne by its Available Revolving Commitment to the
         Available Revolving Facility immediately prior to the making of that
         Revolving Advance.

3.3      Reduction of Available Revolving Commitment
         If a Revolving Bank's Revolving Commitment is reduced in accordance
         with the terms hereof after the Agent has received the Notice of
         Drawdown for a Revolving Advance

                                     -53-
<page>

         and such reduction was not taken into account in the Available
         Revolving Facility, then the amount of that Revolving Advance shall
         be reduced accordingly.

4.       PAYMENT AND CALCULATION OF INTEREST ON REVOLVING ADVANCES

         On the Repayment Date relating to each Revolving Advance (and, if the

         4.3.1    from the Second Restatement Amendment Effective Date until
                  the date falling 6 months after such date, be 3.50 per cent.
                  per annum; and

         4.3.2    at any time thereafter, subject to Clause 4.5 (Revolving
                  Default Margin) and in accordance with the provisions of
                  Clause 4.4 (Revolving Margin Changes), be the percentage
                  rate per annum determined by the ratio of UK Group
                  Consolidated Total Debt on the most recent Specified Quarter
                  Date to Consolidated Annualised EBITDA of the UK Group for

4.4      Revolving Margin Changes
         Any reduction or increase to the Revolving Margin provided for by
         Clause 4.3 (Revolving Margin Ratchet) shall take effect in relation
         to all existing Revolving Advances and future Revolving Advances, in
         each case with effect from the date the Agent receives the Compliance
         Certificate in accordance with Clause 20.5 (Compliance

                                     -54-
<page>

         Certificates) for its most recent Specified Quarter Date save that
         the first reduction or increase to the Revolving Margin from the rate
         specified in sub-clause 4.3.1 of Clause 4.3 (Revolving Margin
         Ratchet) shall take effect from the date the Agent receives the first
         Compliance Certificate delivered in accordance with Clause 20.5
         (Compliance Certificates) after the date falling six months after the
         Second Restatement Amendment Effective Date. Any change in the
         Revolving Margin applicable to an existing Revolving Advance shall
         only relate to the remainder of the current Term of such a Revolving
         Advance.

4.5      Revolving Default Margin
         If at any time on or after the date falling 6 months after the Second
         Restatement Amendment Effective Date the Agent (acting reasonably)
         determines (in writing) that an Event of Default or Potential Event
         of Default has occurred or come into existence, the Revolving Margin
         shall, from the date of such determination until the date specified
         by the Agent (in writing) as being the date on which it has been
         demonstrated to its satisfaction (acting reasonably) that such Event
         of Default or Potential Event of Default is no longer continuing, be
         4 per cent. per annum. The Agent shall promptly notify the other
         parties hereto of any determination that an Event of Default or
         Potential Event of Default has occurred or exists or, as the case may
         be, that it has been demonstrated to its satisfaction (acting
         reasonably) that such is no longer continuing.

5.       UTILISATION OF THE TERM FACILITY

         The Term Facility has been utilised in full.

6.       INTEREST PERIODS FOR TERM ADVANCES

6.1      Interest Periods
         The period for which a Term Advance is outstanding shall be divided
         into successive periods (each an "Interest Period") each of which
         (other than the first, which shall begin on the day the Term Advance
         is made) shall start on the last day of the preceding Interest
         Period.

6.2      Duration
         The duration of each Interest Period shall, save as otherwise
         provided herein, be one, two, three or six months or such other
         period as the Agent (acting on the instructions of all Term Banks)
         may agree, in each case as the Post-Novation Borrower may by not less
         than five Business Days' prior notice (or such shorter notice period
         as all the Term Banks may agree) to the Agent select, provided that:

         6.2.1    if the Post-Novation Borrower fails to give such notice of
                  its selection in relation to an Interest Period, the
                  duration of that Interest Period shall, subject to
                  sub-clause 6.2.2 of this Clause 6.2, be one month; and

         6.2.2    in respect of a Term Advance which, after taking into
                  account other Term Advances with Interest Periods ending on
                  or before a given Term Repayment Date, needs to be applied
                  in whole or in part in a repayment of the Term Loan on such
                  Term Repayment Date in accordance with Clause 11.1 (Term
                  Repayment Instalments), an Interest Period which would
                  otherwise end during

                                     -55-
<page>

                  the month preceding, or extend beyond, that Term Repayment
                  Date shall be of such duration that it shall end on that
                  Term Repayment Date.

6.3      Consolidation of Term Advances
         If two or more Interest Periods end at the same time, then, on the
         last day of those Interest Periods, the Term Advances to which they
         relate shall be consolidated into and treated as a single Term
         Advance.

6.4      Division of Term Advances
         The Post-Novation Borrower may, by not less than five Business Days'
         prior notice (or such shorter notice period as all the Term Banks may
         agree) to the Agent, direct that a Term Advance shall, at the
         beginning of any Interest Period relating thereto, be divided into
         (and thereafter, save as otherwise provided herein, treated in all
         respects as) two or more Term Advances in such amounts (in aggregate,
         equalling the amount of the Term Advance being so divided) as shall
         be specified by the Post-Novation Borrower in such notice, provided
         that the Post-Novation Borrower shall not be entitled to make such a
         direction if any Term Advance thereby coming into existence would be
         of an amount less than (pound)50,000,000.

7.       PAYMENT AND CALCULATION OF INTEREST ON TERM ADVANCES

7.1      Payment of Interest
         On the last day of each Interest Period (and, if such Interest Period
         exceeds six months, on the expiry of each period of six months during
         such Interest Period), the Post-Novation Borrower shall pay accrued
         interest on the Term Advance to which such Interest Period relates.

7.2      Calculation of Interest
         The rate of interest applicable to a Term Advance from time to time
         during an Interest Period relating thereto shall be the rate per
         annum which is the sum of:

         7.2.1    the Term Margin;

         7.2.2    the Mandatory Cost Rate; and

         7.2.3    LIBOR.

8.       MARKET DISRUPTION AND ALTERNATIVE INTEREST RATES

8.1      Market Disruption
         If:

         8.1.1    in relation to any Advance LIBOR is to be determined by
                  reference to Reference Banks and at or about 11.00 a.m. on
                  the Quotation Date for the relevant Term or Interest Period
                  none or only one of the Reference Banks supplies a rate for
                  the purpose of determining LIBOR for the relevant Term or
                  Interest Period; or

         8.1.2    in relation to a Revolving Advance, before the close of
                  business in London on the Quotation Date for such Advance
                  the Agent has been notified by a Revolving Bank or Revolving
                  Banks to whom in aggregate fifty per cent. or

                                     -56-
<page>

                  more of such Revolving Advance would be owed if made, that
                  LIBOR does not accurately reflect the cost of funding its
                  participation in such Revolving Advance; or

         8.1.3    in relation to a Term Advance, before the close of business
                  in London on the Quotation Date for such Advance the Agent
                  has been notified by a Term Bank or Terms Banks to whom in
                  aggregate fifty per cent. or more of such Term Advance is
                  owed that LIBOR does not accurately reflect the cost of
                  funding its participation in such Term Advance,

         then the Agent shall notify the Parent, the relevant Borrower and the
         Revolving Banks or, as the case may be, the Term Banks of such event
         and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
         Clause 8.2 (Substitute Interest Rate and Substitute Term or Interest
         Period) shall apply to such Advance (if it is a Rollover Advance or a
         Term Advance that is already outstanding). If any of sub-clauses
         8.1.1, 8.1.2 or 8.1.3 of this Clause 8.1 applies to a proposed
         Revolving Advance (other than a Rollover Advance), such Revolving
         Advance shall not be made or permitted.

8.2      Substitute Interest Rate and Substitute Term or Interest Period
         If sub-clause 8.1.1 of Clause 8.1 (Market Disruption) applies to an
         Advance, the duration of the relevant Term or Interest Period shall
         be one month or, if less, such that it shall end on the Revolving
         Termination Date (in the case of a Rollover Advance) or the next
         succeeding Term Repayment Date (in the case of a Term Advance). If
         any of sub-clauses 8.1.1, 8.1.2 or 8.1.3 of Clause 8.1 (Market
         Disruption) applies to an Advance, the rate of interest applicable to
         each Revolving Bank's or, as the case may be, each Term Bank's
         portion of such Advance during the relevant Term or Interest Period
         shall (subject to any agreement reached pursuant to Clause 8.3
         (Alternative Rate)) be the rate per annum which is the sum of:

         8.2.1    the Revolving Margin at such time or, as the case may be,
                  the Term Margin;

         8.2.2    the Mandatory Cost Rate; and

         8.2.3    the rate per annum notified to the Agent by such Revolving
                  Bank or such Term Bank before the last day of such Term or
                  Interest Period to be that which expresses as a percentage
                  rate per annum the cost to such Revolving Bank or Term Bank
                  of funding from whatever sources it may reasonably select
                  its portion of such Advance during such Term or Interest
                  Period.

8.3      Alternative Rate
         If any of those events mentioned in sub-clauses 8.1.1, 8.1.2 or 8.1.3
         of Clause 8.1 (Market Disruption) occurs in relation to an Advance
         and if the Agent or the Parent so requires, the Agent and the Parent
         shall enter into negotiations with a view to agreeing a substitute
         basis (i) for determining the rates of interest from time to time
         applicable to the relevant Advances and/or (ii) upon which the
         relevant Advances may be maintained (whether in sterling or some
         other currency) thereafter and any such substitute basis that is
         agreed shall take effect in accordance with its terms and be binding
         on each party hereto, provided that the Agent may not agree any such
         substitute basis without the prior consent of each Bank (which is not
         to be unreasonably withheld).

                            to Clause 3.2 (Each Revolving Bank's Participation
                            in Revolving Advances).

         9.1.2    The Agent shall, promptly upon receipt of notification under
                  Clause 6.2 (Duration), notify each Term Bank of the proposed

                  such notice relates.

9.2      Interest Rate Determination
         The Agent shall promptly notify the relevant Borrower and the

         the Revolving Banks) the Revolving Margin or (in the case of the Term
         Banks) the Term Margin.

9.3      Changes to Advances or Interest Rates

         interest rate occasioned by the operation of Clause 8 (Market
         Disruption and Alternative Interest Rates).

10.      REPAYMENT OF THE REVOLVING FACILITY

         Each Borrower to which a Revolving Advance has been made shall repay
         the Revolving Advance made to it in full on the Repayment Date
         relating thereto. For the avoidance of doubt, the Revolving Facility
         shall be repaid in full on the Revolving Termination Date.

11.      REPAYMENT OF THE TERM FACILITY

11.1     Term Repayment Instalments

         The Post-Novation Borrower shall repay the Term Loan in instalments

11.2     Selection of Term Advances
         If, in relation to a Term Repayment Date, the aggregate amount of the
         Term Advances exceeds the amount of the Term Loan to be repaid, the
         Post-Novation Borrower may, by not less than five Business Days'
         prior notice (or such shorter notice period as all the Term Banks may
         agree) to the Agent, select which of those Term Advances will be
         wholly or partially repaid, provided that:

         11.2.1   the Post-Novation Borrower may not make any such selection
                  if, as a result, more than one such Term Advance would fall
                  to be partially repaid; and

         11.2.2   if the Post-Novation Borrower fails to give such notice, the
                  Agent shall select the Term Advances to be wholly or
                  partially repaid.

12.      CANCELLATION AND PREPAYMENT

12.1     Cancellation of the Revolving Facility
         The Parent may, by giving to the Agent not less than five Business
         Days' prior written notice to that effect, cancel the whole or any
         part (being a minimum amount of (pound)50,000,000 and an integral
         multiple of (pound)10,000,000) of the Available Revolving Facility.
         Any such cancellation shall reduce the Available Revolving Commitment
         and Revolving Commitment of each Revolving Bank rateably. Any amount
         so cancelled under this Clause 12.1 may not be reborrowed.

12.2     Prepayment of the Revolving Facility
         Subject to the provisions of Clause 27.4 (Break Costs), a Borrower to
         which a Revolving Advance has been made may, by giving to the Agent
         not less than five Business Days' prior written notice to that
         effect, prepay the whole or any part of a Revolving Advance (being a
         minimum amount of (pound)50,000,000 and an integral multiple of
         (pound)10,000,000).

12.3     Prepayment of the Term Loan
         12.3.1   Subject to sub-clause 12.3.2, the Post-Novation Borrower
                  may, by giving to the Agent not less than five Business
                  Days' prior notice (or such shorter notice period as the
                  Term Banks may agree) to that effect, prepay the whole or
                  any part of the Term Loan (being a minimum amount of
                  (pound)50,000,000 and an integral multiple of
                  (pound)10,000,000). Any prepayment so made shall satisfy pro
                  tanto the Post-Novation Borrower's obligations under Clause
                  11.1 (Term Repayment Instalments) and shall be applied

                            sub-clause 12.3.1 above, the Post-Novation
                            Borrower shall also, in addition to any amount
                            payable under Clause 27.4 (Break Costs), pay to
                            the Agent for the account of the Term Banks the
                            applicable Term Prepayment Amount. No Term
                            Prepayment Amount shall be payable in respect of a
                            prepayment required by the Banks (or such of the
                            Banks as may be relevant in accordance with Clause
                            42 (Amendments)) as a condition to any consent,

                            Documents.

                  12.3.3    Subject to this Clause 12.3 and whilst the
                            Revolving Facility subsists, a prepayment may only
                            be made under the Term Facility (a "Term Facility
                            Prepayment") if a contemporaneous prepayment is
                            made under the Revolving Facility (a "Revolving
                            Facility Prepayment") (in accordance with Clause
                            12.2 (Prepayment of the Revolving Facility)) and
                            the amount of the Revolving Facility Prepayment
                            bears the same proportion to the sum of the Term
                            Facility Prepayment and the Revolving Facility
                            Prepayment as the Total Revolving Commitments
                            bears to the Total Commitments at that time.

                  12.3.4    If, on the day on which the Term Facility
                            Prepayment and the Revolving Facility Prepayment
                            are due to be made, the amount of the Revolving
                            Facility Prepayment determined under sub-clause
                            12.3.3 exceeds the Revolving Loan, the Revolving
                            Loan shall be prepaid in full and the Available
                            Revolving Facility shall be reduced by an amount
                            equal to the difference between the Revolving
                            Facility Prepayment determined under sub-clause
                            12.3.3 and the Revolving Loan. Any such
                            cancellation shall reduce the Available Revolving
                            Commitment and Revolving Commitment of each
                            Revolving Bank rateably. Any amount so prepaid or
                            cancelled under this Clause 12.3 may not be
                            reborrowed.

12.4     Notice of Cancellation or Prepayment
         Any notice of cancellation or prepayment given by the Parent or a
         Borrower pursuant to this Clause 12 shall be irrevocable, shall
         specify the date upon which such cancellation or prepayment is to be
         made and the amount of such cancellation or prepayment and, in the
         case of a notice of prepayment, shall oblige the relevant Borrower to
         make such prepayment on such date.

12.5     Repayment of a Bank's Share of Loan
         If:

         12.5.1   any sum payable to any Bank by an Obligor is required to be
                  increased pursuant to Clause 14.1 (Tax Gross-up); or

         12.5.2   any Bank claims indemnification from an Obligor under Clause
                  14.2 (Tax Indemnity), the Agent claims indemnification from
                  an Obligor under Clause 14.2 (Tax Indemnity) in respect of a
                  payment received by it and paid by it to a Bank under the
                  Finance Documents, or any Bank claims indemnification from a
                  Borrower under Clause 16.1 (Increased Costs),

                  the Parent may, whilst such circumstance continues, give the
                  Agent at least five Business Days' prior written notice
                  (which notice shall be irrevocable) of its intention to
                  procure the repayment of such Bank's share of the Loan. On
                  the last day of each then current Term or Interest Period,
                  or at any other time subject to the provisions of Clause
                  27.4 (Break Costs), each Borrower to which an Advance has
                  been made shall repay such Bank's portion of the Advance to
                  which such Term or Interest Period relates. Any repayment of
                  a Term Advance under this Clause 12.5 shall reduce rateably
                  the remaining obligations of the Post-Novation Borrower
                  under Clause 11.1 (Term Repayment Instalments).

12.6     No Further Advances
         A Bank for whose account a repayment is to be made under Clause 12.5
         (Repayment of a Bank's Share of Loan) shall not be obliged to
         participate in the making of Revolving Advances on or after the date
         upon which the Agent receives the Parent's notice of its intention to
         procure the repayment of such Bank's share of the Loan, and such
         Bank's Available Revolving Commitment shall be reduced to zero.

12.7     No Other Repayments
         No Borrower shall repay all or any part of the Loan except at the
         times and in the manner expressly provided for in this Agreement.

13.      MANDATORY PREPAYMENT

13.1     Mandatory Prepayment from Excess Cash Flow
         The Parent shall ensure that within 15 Business Days of delivery of
         the most recent financial statements of the UK Group pursuant to
         Clause 20.2 (Quarterly Statements), commencing with the financial
         statements delivered in respect of the Financial Quarter ending 31
         December 2002, a percentage of the Parent's determination of Excess
         Cash Flow for the Financial Quarter to which such quarterly financial
         statements relate (such determination of Excess Cash Flow to be made
         by reference to such quarterly financial statements and to be set out
         in sufficient detail (including the relevant numbers used in
         computing each component part of "Operating Cash Flow" and "Group
         Total Debt Service") delivered with such quarterly financial
         statements) is applied in cancellation and repayment of the Loan in
         accordance with Clause 13.6 (Application of Proceeds), irrespective
         of whether or not the Reporting Accountants have, prior to the end of
         such 15 Business Day period, verified the Parent's determination of
         Excess Cash Flow. The percentage of Excess Cash Flow in any Financial
         Quarter which is required to be applied in cancellation and repayment
         of the Loan pursuant to this Clause 13.1 shall be determined by
         reference to the ratio of UK Group Consolidated Total Debt to
         Consolidated Annualised EBITDA of the UK Group for such Financial
         Quarter in accordance with the table below:

         provided that if, pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Clause
         13.1, any amount is applied in cancellation and repayment of the Loan
         in accordance with Clause 13.6 (Application of Proceeds) prior to
         verification by the Reporting Accountants of the Parent's
         determination of Excess Cash Flow, and the subsequent verification
         thereof by the Reporting Accountants demonstrates that:

         (a)      a further amount of Excess Cash Flow for the relevant
                  Financial Quarter should have been applied in cancellation
                  and repayment of the Loan in order to fully satisfy the

                  such effect from the Agent or from the Reporting Accountants
                  on behalf of the Agent, apply such further amount in

                  Amount") is less than the amount actually applied by the
                  Parent in cancellation and repayment of the Loan in respect
                  of such Financial Quarter (the "Applied Amount"), the
                  difference between the Applied Amount and the Verified

                  future amount of Excess Cash Flow which falls due, pursuant
                  to the foregoing provisions of this Clause 13.1, to be
                  applied in cancellation and repayment of the Loan in

                  terms of sub-clause 13.2.1 of this Clause 13.2 are no more
                  onerous than the mandatory prepayment from asset disposals

                  (a)       such disposal was on arms' length terms and the
                            net disposal proceeds are to be reinvested in
                            similar or like assets of a comparable or superior
                            quality or applied towards the UK Group's Capital
                            Expenditure within a period of 365 days from the
                            date of receipt of such proceeds by the relevant
                            member of the UK Group; or

                  (b)       such disposal was on arms' length terms and in the
                            ordinary and usual course of business of such
                            member of the UK Group; or

                  (c)       the net disposal proceeds, when aggregated with
                            the net disposal proceeds received by members of
                            the UK Group in respect of disposals falling
                            within paragraph (g)(A) of the definition of
                            Permitted Disposals made in the immediately
                            preceding twelve calendar month period (excluding
                            the proceeds from disposals falling within
                            paragraph (a) or paragraph (b) above), does not
                            exceed (pound)10,000,000 (or its equivalent in
                            other currencies).

                  In the case of paragraph (a) above only, the net disposal
                  proceeds referred to therein will be deposited in the
                  Prepayment Escrow Account and the relevant member of the UK
                  Group shall be entitled, during the 365 day period, to
                  withdraw (or require the Parent to withdraw) sums from such
                  account only to the extent that it is able reasonably to
                  demonstrate that such sums will be reinvested or applied in
                  accordance with the provisions of paragraph (a) above. Any
                  amounts not reinvested as specified in paragraph (a) above
                  during the 365 day period specified therein shall thereafter
                  be applied in repayment of the Loan in accordance with
                  Clause 13.6 (Application of Proceeds).

         13.2.4   For the avoidance of doubt, the Parent shall also ensure
                  that the net proceeds of any disposal falling within
                  paragraph (m) of the definition of Permitted Disposal of any
                  asset by any member of the UK Group are applied in

         13.2.5   For the purposes of this Clause 13.2 and Clause 13.3
                  (Mandatory Prepayment from Insurance Proceeds), "Net
                  Proceeds" and "Asset Disposition" shall each bear the
                  meaning given to such term in the Exit Financing Indenture
                  as set out in Appendix B (Change of Control and Asset
                  Disposition provisions of the Exit Financing Indenture) as
                  those definitions may be amended from time to time provided
                  that no amendment to either of those definitions shall be
                  taken into account for the purposes of this Clause 13.2
                  until such time as the Agent shall have received a copy of
                  the amended definitions and such other information in
                  relation thereto as the Agent may reasonably request.

13.3     Mandatory Prepayment from Insurance Proceeds
         The Parent shall ensure that Insurance Proceeds (including, for the
         avoidance of doubt, Net Proceeds of any Asset Disposition (each as
         defined in sub-clause 13.2.5 of Clause 13.2 (Mandatory Prepayment
         from Asset Disposals)) received from an insurance claim) received by
         any member of the UK Group above an aggregate minimum threshold of
         Insurance Proceeds of (pound)10,000,000 (or its equivalent in other
         currencies) (the "Minimum Threshold"), are paid to the Agent and
         applied in repayment of the Loan in accordance with Clause 13.6
         (Application of Proceeds), unless the Insurance Proceeds received
         above the Minimum Threshold are:

         13.3.1   promptly upon receipt deposited in the Prepayment Escrow
                  Account in accordance with the provisions of Clause 13.4
                  (Payment of Insurance Proceeds into Prepayment Escrow
                  Account); and

         13.3.2   applied, to the satisfaction of the Agent, towards the
                  replacement, reinstatement and/or repair of the assets
                  and/or the satisfaction of business interruption losses in
                  respect of which the relevant insurance claim was made (or
                  to refinance any expenditure incurred in the replacement,
                  reinstatement and/or repair of such assets and/or the
                  satisfaction of business interruption losses) within a
                  period of 365 days from the date of receipt of such
                  Insurance Proceeds by the relevant member of the UK Group.

13.4     Payment of Insurance Proceeds into Prepayment Escrow Account
         The Parent shall ensure that any Insurance Proceeds to be applied in
         accordance with sub-clause 13.3.2 of Clause 13.3 (Mandatory
         Prepayment from Insurance Proceeds) are deposited in the Prepayment
         Escrow Account. The relevant member of the UK Group that received the
         Insurance Proceeds shall be entitled, during the period of 365 days
         from its receipt of the Insurance Proceeds, to withdraw sums from the
         Prepayment Escrow Account only to the extent that it is able to
         reasonably demonstrate that such sums will be applied towards the
         replacement, reinstatement and/or repair of the assets and/or the
         satisfaction of business interruption losses in respect of which the
         relevant insurance claim was made (or to refinance any expenditure
         incurred in the replacement, reinstatement and/or repair of such
         assets and/or the satisfaction of business interruption losses). Any
         sums not so withdrawn during such 365 day period shall thereafter be
         paid to the Agent and applied in repayment of the Loan in accordance
         with Clause 13.6 (Application of Proceeds).

                  (b)       if no such right of withdrawal is available, if it
                            has ceased to be available or if the Parent so
                            instructs the Agent, be applied on one or more

                            time as such amounts have been applied in full in
                            repayment of the Loan in accordance with this
                            Clause 13.6.

                  repayment of the Loan in accordance with this Clause 13.6
                  (and then on the dates indicated in sub-clause 13.6.1
                  above), be applied as follows:

                            Commitments bear to the Total Commitments (such
                            portion of the Relevant Amount being hereinafter
                            referred to as the "Revolving Relevant Amount")

                            Relevant Amount exceeds the Revolving Loan in
                            payment to the relevant member of the UK Group,
                            with a corresponding cancellation of the Available

                            amount of such payment; and

                  (b)       in prepayment of the Term Loan by that portion of
                            the Relevant Amount equal to the proportion which
                            the Total Term Commitments bears to the Total
                            Commitments.

                            which case such amount shall be applied to reduce
                            the Revolving Loan in accordance with paragraph
                            (a) of sub-clause 13.6.2.

                            avoidance of doubt, any change of control
                            occurring by reason of the issuance by New NTL of
                            the New NTL Common Stock pursuant to the Plan
                            shall not constitute a change of control for the

                            share capital of New NTL (excluding any part of
                            that issued share capital that carries no voting

                  of a solvent reorganisation of the Group on terms approved

14.      TAXES

14.1     Tax Gross-up
         All payments to be made by an Obligor to any Finance Party under the
         Finance Documents shall be made free and clear of and without
         deduction for or on account of tax unless such Obligor is required by
         law to make such a payment subject to the deduction or withholding of
         tax, in which case the sum payable by such Obligor (in respect of
         which such deduction or withholding is required to be made) shall,
         subject to Clause 14.4 (Excluded Claims), be increased to the extent
         necessary to ensure that such Finance Party receives a sum net of any
         deduction or withholding equal to the sum which it would have
         received had no such deduction or withholding been made or required
         to be made.

14.2     Tax Indemnity
         Without prejudice to Clause 14.1 (Tax Gross-up), if the Agent or (as
         a result of the introduction of, or change in or in the
         interpretation, administration or application of, any law or
         regulation or order or governmental rule or double taxation agreement
         or any published practice or concession of any relevant taxing
         authority after the Execution Date) any Bank (a) is required to make
         any payment of or on account of tax on or in relation to any sum
         received or receivable under the Finance Documents (including any sum
         deemed for purposes of tax to be received or receivable by such
         Finance Party, whether or not actually received or receivable) or (b)
         has any liability in respect of any such payment asserted, imposed,
         levied or assessed against it, the relevant Obligor shall, within
         five Business Days of demand by the Agent, promptly indemnify the
         Agent or Bank which suffers a loss or liability as a result against
         such payment or liability, together with any interest, penalties,
         costs and expenses payable or incurred in connection therewith,
         provided that this 14.2 shall not apply to:

         14.2.1   any tax imposed on and calculated by reference to the net
                  income, profits or gains actually received or receivable by
                  the Agent or such Bank (but, for the avoidance of doubt, not
                  including any sum deemed for purposes of tax to be received
                  or receivable by the Agent or such Bank but not actually
                  receivable) by the jurisdiction in which the Agent or such
                  Bank is incorporated or, if different, the jurisdiction (or
                  jurisdictions) in which the Agent or such Bank is treated as
                  resident for tax purposes; or

         14.2.2   any tax imposed on and calculated by reference to the net
                  income, profits or gains of the Facility Office of the Agent
                  or such Bank actually received or receivable by the Agent or
                  such Bank (but, for the avoidance of doubt, not including
                  any sum deemed for purposes of tax to be received or
                  receivable by the Agent or such Bank but not actually
                  receivable) by the jurisdiction in which its Facility Office
                  is located; or

                                     -69-
<page>

         14.2.3   any tax imposed on a Bank which would not have arisen but
                  for a sub-participation in respect of its rights and
                  benefits under any of the Finance Documents.

14.3     Claims by Banks and the Agent
         A Bank intending to make a claim pursuant to Clause 14.2 (Tax
         Indemnity) shall notify the Agent of the event giving rise to the
         claim, whereupon the Agent shall notify the Parent and the Borrowers
         thereof. If the Agent intends to make a claim pursuant to Clause 14.2
         (Tax Indemnity) it shall notify the Parent and the Borrowers of the
         event giving rise to the claim.

14.4     Excluded Claims
         If any Finance Party is not or ceases to be a Qualifying Lender, no
         Obligor shall be liable to pay to that Finance Party under Clause
         14.1 (Tax Gross-Up) any amount in respect of taxes levied or imposed
         in excess of the amount it would have been obliged to pay if that
         Finance Party had been or had not ceased to be a Qualifying Lender
         provided that this Clause 14.4 shall not apply (and each Obligor
         shall be obliged to comply with its obligations under Clause 14.1
         (Tax Gross-Up)) if:

         14.4.1   after the Execution Date there shall have been any
                  introduction of, or change in or in the interpretation,
                  administration or application of, any law or regulation or
                  order or governmental rule or double taxation agreement or
                  any published practice or concession of any relevant taxing
                  authority and as a result thereof such Finance Party ceases
                  to be a Qualifying Lender; or

         14.4.2   such Finance Party is not or ceases to be a Qualifying
                  Lender as a result of the actions of any Obligor.

14.5     Treaty Lenders
         A Treaty Lender and each Obligor which makes a payment to which that
         Treaty Lender is entitled shall co-operate in completing any
         procedural formalities necessary for that Obligor to obtain
         authorisation to make that payment without a deduction or withholding
         for or on account of tax. If an Obligor is able to demonstrate that a
         deduction or withholding for or on account of tax is required to be
         made by it as a result of a Treaty Lender's failure to so co-operate,
         such an Obligor shall not be liable to pay any increased amount under
         Clause 14.1 (Tax Gross-Up) as a result of such a deduction or
         withholding.

14.6     Notification of Status
         Each Bank shall notify the Agent if it is not a Qualifying Lender at
         the time it becomes a Bank hereunder or, if it is then a Qualifying
         Lender, shall promptly notify the Agent if at any time thereafter it
         ceases to be a Qualifying Lender. The Agent shall promptly notify the
         Parent of any notices it receives under this Clause 14.6.

15.      TAX RECEIPTS

15.1     Notification of Requirement to Deduct Tax
         If, at any time, an Obligor is required by law to make any deduction
         or withholding from any sum payable by it under the Finance Documents
         (or if thereafter there is any change in the rates at which or the
         manner in which such deductions or withholdings are

                                     -70-
<page>

         calculated), such Obligor and the Bank to which such sum is payable
         shall promptly upon becoming aware of such a requirement notify the
         Agent accordingly. If the Agent receives such a notification from a
         Bank it shall promptly notify the Parent and the Obligor who is
         required to make such a deduction or withholding.

15.2     Evidence of Payment of Tax
         If an Obligor makes any payment under the Finance Documents in
         respect of which it is required to make any deduction or withholding,
         it shall pay the full amount required to be deducted or withheld to
         the relevant taxation or other authority within the time allowed for
         such payment under applicable law and shall request and, within
         thirty days of it receiving the same, deliver to the Agent for each
         relevant Bank an original receipt (or a certified copy thereof)
         issued by such authority evidencing the payment to such authority of
         all amounts so required to be deducted or withheld in respect of that
         Bank's share of such payment.

15.3     Tax Credit Payment
         If an additional payment is made under Clause 14 (Taxes) by an
         Obligor for the benefit of any Finance Party and such Finance Party,
         in its sole discretion, determines that it has obtained (and has
         derived full use and benefit from) a credit against, a relief or
         remission for, or repayment of, any tax, then, if and to the extent
         that such Finance Party, in its sole opinion, determines that such
         credit, relief, remission or repayment is in respect of or calculated
         with reference to or otherwise relates to the additional payment made
         pursuant to Clause 14 (Taxes), such Finance Party shall, to the
         extent that it can do so without prejudice to the retention of the
         amount of such credit, relief, remission or repayment, pay to such
         Obligor such amount as such Finance Party shall, in its sole opinion,
         determine to be the amount which will leave such Finance Party (after
         such payment) in no worse after-tax position than it would have been
         in had the additional payment in question not been required to be
         made by such Obligor.

15.4     Tax Credit Clawback
         If any Finance Party makes any payment to an Obligor pursuant to
         Clause 15.3 (Tax Credit Payment) and such Finance Party subsequently
         determines, in its sole opinion, that the credit, relief, remission
         or repayment in respect of which such payment was made was not
         available or has been withdrawn or that it was unable to use such
         credit, relief, remission or repayment in full, such Obligor shall
         reimburse such Finance Party such amount as such Finance Party
         determines, in its sole opinion, is necessary to place it in the same
         after-tax position as it would have been in if such credit, relief,
         remission or repayment had been obtained and fully used and retained
         by such Finance Party.

15.5     Tax and Other Affairs
         No provision of this Agreement shall interfere with the right of any
         Finance Party to arrange its tax or any other affairs in whatever
         manner it thinks fit, oblige any Finance Party to claim any credit,
         relief, remission or repayment in respect of any payment under Clause
         14 (Taxes) in priority to any other credit, relief, remission or
         repayment available to it nor oblige any Finance Party to disclose
         any information relating to its tax or other affairs or any
         computations in respect thereof.

16.      INCREASED COSTS

16.1     Increased Costs
         If, by reason of the occurrence, in each case after the Execution
         Date, of (a) any change in law or in its interpretation or
         administration and/or (b) compliance with any such new law or with
         any request or requirement relating to the maintenance of capital or
         any other request from or requirement of any central bank or other
         fiscal, monetary or other authority (in each case, where a request or
         requirement that does not have the force of law is a request or
         requirement with which financial institutions subject to such request
         or requirement are generally accustomed to comply):

         16.1.1   a Bank or any holding company of such Bank is unable to
                  obtain the rate of return on its capital which it would have
                  been able to obtain but for such Bank's entering into or
                  assuming or maintaining a commitment or performing its
                  obligations under the Finance Documents;

         16.1.2   a Bank or any holding company of such Bank incurs a cost as
                  a result of such Bank's entering into or assuming or
                  maintaining a commitment or performing its obligations under
                  the Finance Documents; or

         16.1.3   there is any increase in the cost to a Bank or any holding
                  company of such Bank of funding or maintaining such Bank's
                  share of the Advances or any Unpaid Sum,

         then the Borrower(s) of the relevant Facility (acting through the
         Parent) shall, within three Business Days of a demand of the Agent,
         pay to the Agent for the account of that Bank amounts sufficient to
         indemnify that Bank or to enable that Bank to indemnify its holding
         company from and against, as the case may be, (i) such reduction in
         the rate of return on its capital, (ii) such cost or (iii) such
         increased cost.

16.2     Increased Costs Claims
         A Bank intending to make a claim pursuant to Clause 16.1 (Increased
         Costs) shall notify the Agent of the event giving rise to such claim,
         whereupon the Agent shall notify the Parent thereof.

16.3     Exclusions
         Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Clause 16, no Bank
         shall be entitled to make any claim under this Clause 16 in respect
         of any reduction in the rate of return on capital, cost or increased
         cost:

         16.3.1   attributable to a deduction or withholding for or on account
                  of tax from a payment under a Finance Document required by
                  law to be made by an Obligor and compensated for pursuant to
                  the provisions of Clause 14.1 (Tax Gross-Up) (or would have
                  been compensated for under Clause 14.1 (Tax Gross-Up) but
                  was not so compensated solely because of Clause 14.4
                  (Excluded Claims) or Clause 14.5 (Treaty Lenders));

         16.3.2   compensated by Clause 14.2 (Tax Indemnity) (or would have
                  been compensated for under Clause 14.2 (Tax Indemnity) but
                  was not so compensated solely

                                     -72-
<page>

                  because of one of the exclusions set out in sub-clauses
                  14.2.1 to 14.2.3 of Clause 14.2 (Tax Indemnity));

         16.3.3   compensated by the Mandatory Cost Rate; or

         16.3.4   attributable to the wilful breach by the relevant Finance
                  Party or its affiliates of any law or regulation.

17.      ILLEGALITY

         If, at any time, it is or will become unlawful for a Bank to make,
         fund or allow to remain outstanding all or part of its share of the
         Advances, then that Bank shall, promptly after becoming aware of the
         same, deliver to the Parent through the Agent a notice to that effect
         and:

         17.1.1   such Bank shall not thereafter be obliged to participate in
                  the making of any Advances and the amount of its Available
                  Revolving Commitment shall be immediately reduced to zero;
                  and

         17.1.2   if the Agent on behalf of such Bank so requires, each
                  Borrower which has drawn an Advance shall no later than the
                  last day permitted by law repay such Bank's share of any
                  outstanding Advances together with accrued interest thereon
                  and all other amounts owing to such Bank under the Finance
                  Documents and any repayment of Term Advances so made shall
                  reduce rateably the remaining obligations of the
                  Post-Novation Borrower under Clause 11.1 (Term Repayment
                  Instalments).

18.      MITIGATION

         If, in respect of any Bank, circumstances arise which would or would
         upon the giving of notice result in:

         18.1.1   an increase in any sum payable to it or for its account
                  pursuant to Clause 14.1 (Tax Gross-up);

         18.1.2   a claim for indemnification pursuant to Clause 14.2 (Tax
                  Indemnity) or Clause 16.1 (Increased Costs); or

         18.1.3   the reduction of its Available Revolving Commitment to zero
                  or any repayment to be made pursuant to Clause 17
                  (Illegality),

         then, without in any way limiting, reducing or otherwise qualifying
         the rights of such Bank or the obligations of the Obligors or the
         Parent under any of the Clauses referred to above, such Bank shall
         promptly upon becoming aware of such circumstances notify the Agent
         thereof and, in consultation with the Agent and the Parent and to the
         extent that it can do so lawfully, take reasonable steps (including a
         change of location of its Facility Office or the transfer of its
         rights, benefits and obligations under the Finance Documents to
         another financial institution acceptable to the Parent and willing to
         participate in any Facility in which such Bank has participated) to
         mitigate the effects of such circumstances, provided that such Bank
         shall be under no obligation to take any such action if, in the
         opinion of such Bank, to do so might have any adverse effect upon its

                                     -73-
<page>

         business, operations or financial condition (other than any minor
         costs and expenses of an administrative nature).

                  Agent) as neither unreasonable, nor to any material extent
                  unattainable, any of the forecasts or projections set out in
                  the latest Budget delivered under Clause 20.6 (Budgets); and

         19.13.1  Subject (in each case) to the Reservations, each Security
                  Document and Second Security Document creates the security
                  interest which that Security Document or Second Security
                  Document purports to create or, if that Security Document or
                  Second Security Document purports to evidence a security
                  interest, accurately evidences a security interest which has
                  been validly created and each security interest ranks in
                  priority (save in respect of, if and to the extent
                  applicable, Permitted Encumbrances) as specified in the

                  evidencing that interest.

                  Encumbrance under the Security Documents and Second Security
                  Documents are fully paid and not subject to any option to
                  purchase or similar rights and the constitutional documents
                  of any such UK Group member do not and could not restrict or
                  inhibit (whether absolutely, partly, under a discretionary
                  power or otherwise) any transfer of such shares pursuant to
                  enforcement of the Security Documents or the Second Security
                  Documents.

         19.13.3  For the avoidance of doubt, the Security is intended to
                  secure all amounts outstanding under the Finance Documents
                  from time to time, including without limitation, all amounts
                  made available by the Term Banks and the Additional Finance
                  Providers.

                  reference to the then current performance of the UK Group
                  and if the Agent (acting on the instructions of an
                  Instructing Group) informs the Parent that the result of
                  such review is that there is no ongoing need for Monthly
                  Performance Update Reports no member of the Group shall have
                  any further obligations under this Clause 20.7.

                  out at Clause 21 (Financial Condition) were being tested at
                  such time.

         20.10.2  Each Obligor shall, and the Parent shall procure that each

                  obligation to supply any information the supply of which
                  would be contrary to any confidentiality obligation binding
                  on it.

                            by it is contributed to the other members of the
                            UK Group by way of Parent Funding.

                  Funding and on-lent by the Parent to members of the UK Group
                  (other than the Parent) by way of Parent Funding (the amount
                  of such cash proceeds so notified being hereinafter referred
                  to as the "Exit Contributed Amount"), are to constitute
                  Capital Events Proceeds and to be used to prepay and cancel

                  notwithstanding the provisions of the Parent Intra-Group
                  Loan Assignment and the Second Parent Intra-Group Loan
                  Assignment or any other provision of this Agreement, and

         No Obligor shall and the Parent shall procure that no member of the

         the benefit of any person or voluntarily assume any liability,
         whether actual or contingent, in respect of any obligation of any
         other person other than Permitted Loans and Guarantees. Any
         intercompany balance representing any overpayment or any underpayment
         arising as a result of the settlement arrangements referred to at
         paragraph (h)(ii) of the definition of Permitted Loans and Guarantees
         (and any payment in connection with any such overpayment or
         underpayment) shall not constitute a breach of any restriction
         contained in the Finance Documents.

22.19    Disposals
         22.19.1  No Obligor shall and the Parent shall procure that no member

                  indebtedness or, if by way of indebtedness, where the
                  provisions of the documents relating to such indebtedness do
                  not limit (and cannot operate to limit) a sale of the Towers
                  Business, the aggregate fair market value of Asset
                  Dispositions (other than any asset subject to a Sale and

                  "Fiscal Year", "Note Registration" and "Sale and Leaseback
                  Transaction" shall each bear the meaning given to such term
                  in the Exit Financing Indenture as set out in Appendix B
                  (Change of Control and Asset Disposition provisions of the
                  Exit Financing Indenture) or as such definitions in the Exit
                  Financing Indenture may be amended from time to time
                  provided that no amendment to any such

                  the Agent shall have received a copy of the amended
                  definitions and such other information in relation thereto
                  as the Agent may reasonably request.

         22.20.1  No Obligor shall and the Parent shall procure that no member
                  of the UK Group shall incur, or allow to subsist, any

                  arrangement whereby it is entitled to incur, create or allow
                  to subsist any Financial Indebtedness other than Permitted

         22.20.2  New NTL shall procure that NTL UK shall not incur, or allow

                  agreement or arrangement whereby it is entitled to incur,

         be, another member of the UK Group.

22.24    Change of Business
         Save as contemplated in the Updated Business Plan (and provided that
         nothing in this Clause 22.24 shall prevent an Obligor from making any

         Agreement) no Obligor shall and the Parent shall procure that no
         member of the UK Group shall enter into any type of business sector

                  Financial Quarters.

         22.25.3  A breach of this Clause 22.25 shall not constitute an Event
                  of Default if (i) one or more subsidiaries of the Parent
                  become Guarantors (in accordance with Clause 37 (Accession

                  reasonably) is satisfied that this Clause 22.25 will, as a

         22.26.1  those shares are subject to the Security and/or the Second
                  Security; and

         22.26.2  such an alteration would be reasonably likely to prejudice
                  the value of, or the ability of the Security Trustee and/or
                  the Second Security Trustee to realise, the Security and/or
                  the Second Security (as the case may be) over the company

                            assess whether such a transaction is on no worse
                            than arm's length terms, on terms such that the
                            transaction is financially fair to the Parent,
                            relevant Obligor or, as the case may be, other

                  (g)       tax sharing arrangements and agreements to
                            surrender tax losses provided that any such

                            Second Restatement Amendment Effective Time is

                            Network Services is no less than the cost incurred
                            by the Parent, or relevant Obligor or, as the case
                            may be, other member of the UK Group in providing

                            member of the UK Group than would be obtainable at

                            with an entity which is not

                            an affiliate or, where there is no comparable
                            arm's length transaction by which to assess
                            whether such a transaction is on terms and
                            conditions not substantially less favourable to
                            the Parent, relevant Obligor or, as the case may
                            be, other member of the UK Group, on such terms

                            case may be, other member of the UK Group.

                  (c)       a list (prepared on a best efforts basis) of all
                            affiliates which had no trading activity or
                            financing arrangements with any member of the UK
                            Group over the relevant Financial Quarter, or
                            written confirmation that there has been no change
                            from the list most recently delivered to the Agent
                            under this paragraph (c).

22.28    Working Capital Facility Amendments
         The Parent shall not agree any material amendments to the terms of
         the Working Capital Facility and shall not (other than pursuant to an
         election under sub-clause 22.16.2 of Clause 22.16 (Mandatory
         Contribution)) voluntarily prepay all or any part thereof unless a
         replacement or substitute therefor is put in place on terms
         acceptable to the Banks. For the avoidance of doubt it is hereby
         agreed that the granting of any Encumbrance or guarantee by an
         Obligor as security for or, as the case may be, a guarantee of,
         amounts due under the Working Capital Facility shall constitute a
         material amendment to the terms of the Working Capital Facility. As
         at the Second Restatement Amendment Effective Time, the remaining
         available commitment under the Working Capital Facility has been
         cancelled and no further advances may be made under the Working
         Capital Facility.

22.29    Change in Financial Year
         No Obligor shall and the Parent shall procure that no member of the
         UK Group shall change the end of its financial year, other than:

         22.29.1  as agreed by an Instructing Group, acting reasonably; or

         22.29.2  so as to ensure that the financial year of any member of the
                  UK Group ends on the same date as the financial year of the
                  Parent.

22.30    Revised Group Structure
         If the Parent becomes aware of any material inaccuracy in the
         corporate structure as set out in the group structure chart delivered
         to the Agent as a condition precedent to the Second Restatement
         Amendment Effective Time or any group structure chart delivered to
         the Agent pursuant to this Clause 22.30, it will deliver to the Agent
         as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter a revised group
         structure chart which is true, complete and accurate insofar as it
         relates to the corporate structure of the UK Group and the Covenant
         Group.

22.31    Hedging
         The Parent shall not, and shall procure that no member of the UK
         Group shall, enter into any Hedging Agreement other than:

         22.31.1  a Secured Hedging Agreement; or

         22.31.2  a Hedging Agreement entered into in accordance with the
                  Hedging Strategy.

22.32    Voluntary Prepayments
         For the avoidance of doubt, the Parent shall not, and shall procure
         that no member of the UK Group shall make any Permitted Payment under
         paragraph (a) of the definition of that term which is used or
         intended to be used to fund a voluntary prepayment by any

                                    -107-

         member of the Covenant Group in respect of all or any part of the
         Financial Indebtedness of such member of the Covenant Group.

22.33    Cancellation of Subordinated UK Group Debt
         New NTL shall procure that NTL UK does not cancel, write-off or
         otherwise forgive all or any part of any loans made by NTL UK to the
         Parent (being Subordinated UK Group Debt), without the prior written
         consent of the Agent, if such cancellation, write-off or other
         forgiveness might reasonably be expected to give rise to material tax
         liabilities for the UK Group taken as a whole, which cannot be
         sheltered by the net operating losses of the Group available at the
         time of such cancellation, write-off or forgiveness.

22.34    Post Plan Effective Date Investigations and Reports
         22.34.1  The Parent undertakes to instruct Sullivan & Cromwell LLC
                  ("S&C") and Deloitte & Touche LLC ("D&T") as soon as
                  reasonably practicable after the Plan Effective Date and in
                  any event within 28 days of the Plan Effective Date, to
                  investigate a representative sample of the UK Group's
                  internal controls including, without limitation, the
                  internal controls relating to the procuring and monitoring
                  of outsourcing arrangements (including in relation to the
                  Profectus Contracts (as defined in S&C's written report
                  dated 18 December 2002 which has been delivered to the
                  Agent) and the Group's information technology services
                  contracts with IBM) and to prepare a written report within 3
                  months of the execution of the engagement letters with S&C
                  and D&T (or such longer period as may reasonably be required
                  in order to complete the relevant investigation). The
                  division of the work between S&C and D&T will reflect their
                  respective expertise. S&C and D&T shall be instructed to
                  detail in the written report the results of such
                  investigation and to recommend any steps to be taken to
                  remedy any material deficiencies in internal controls
                  identified. S&C and D&T shall be instructed by the Parent to
                  include the Banks as addressees of the written report but
                  only on the basis that neither S&C nor D&T shall have any
                  liability to any of the Banks. The Parent shall pay all
                  reasonable fees and expenses incurred by S&C and D&T in
                  making such investigation and preparing such written report.
                  The Parent shall provide S&C and D&T with such access to the
                  books and records and personnel of the Group as may
                  reasonably be required for the purposes of such
                  investigation and written report. S&C and D&T shall be
                  entitled to instruct such third party experts as they may
                  reasonably require to assist them in the investigation and
                  preparation of the written report.

         22.34.2  If the written report referred to at sub-clause 22.34.1 of
                  this Clause 22.34 recommends any proposals to be taken by
                  the UK Group to remedy any material deficiencies in internal
                  controls relating to outsourcing arrangements, the Parent
                  agrees, after consultation with the Agent, representatives
                  of the Banks who were formerly Co-ordinators, S&C and D&T,
                  to adopt such proposals as are considered reasonably
                  commercially practicable as soon as practicable after the
                  conclusion of such consultation provided that the adoption
                  of such proposals are subject to final approval by the board
                  of directors of New NTL acting in its exercise of its
                  fiduciary duties.

         22.34.3  If the written report referred to at sub-clause 22.34.1 of
                  this Clause 22.34 recommends any proposals to be taken by
                  the UK Group to remedy any material deficiencies in internal
                  controls relating to non-outsourcing arrangements, the
                  Parent agrees to consider such proposals as soon as
                  practicable after publication of the report, subject to
                  approval of such proposals by the board of directors of New
                  NTL.

23.      EVENTS OF DEFAULT

         Each of Clause 23.1 (Failure to Pay) to Clause 23.16 (Material
         Adverse Change) describes circumstances which constitute an Event of
         Default for the purposes of this Agreement. Clause 23.17
         (Acceleration and Cancellation) and Clause 23.18 (Advances Due on
         Demand) deal with the rights of the Agent and the Banks after the
         occurrence of an Event of Default.

23.1     Failure to Pay
         Any of the Obligors fails to pay any sum due from it under any of the
         Finance Documents to which it is a party at the time, in the currency
         and in the manner specified therein unless:

         23.1.1   the sum is of a principal amount which was not paid as a
                  result of a technical error or failure in the transmission
                  of funds and that payment is then received by the Agent
                  within one Business Day of the due date;

         23.1.2   the sum is of an amount of interest and that payment is then
                  received by the Agent within three Business Days of the due
                  date; or

         23.1.3   the sum is of an amount other than principal or interest and
                  that payment is then received by the Agent within five
                  Business Days of the due date.

23.2     Misrepresentation
         Any representation or statement made or repeated at any time

                  (or any trustee or agent on its behalf) in respect of those
                  amounts, or apply and enforce the same in such manner and
                  order as it sees fit (whether against those amounts or
                  otherwise) and no Guarantor shall be entitled to the benefit
                  of the same; and

         24.8.2   hold in an interest-bearing suspense account any moneys

         25.3.4   The average daily Available Revolving Commitments during a
                  Commitment Period shall equal the aggregate of the Available
                  Revolving Commitments on each day during such

                  Commitment Period divided by the number of days in such
                  Commitment Period.

         due date therefor in accordance with Clause 30 (Payments) or if any
         sum due and payable by an Obligor under any judgment of any court in
         connection herewith is not paid on the date of such judgment (in
         either case an "Unpaid Sum"), the period beginning on such due date
         or, as the case may be, the date of such judgment and ending on the
         date upon which the obligation of such Obligor to pay such sum is
         discharged shall be divided into successive periods (each an
         "Interest Period"), each of which (other than the first) shall start
         on the last day of the preceding Interest Period and the duration of
         each of which shall (except as otherwise provided in this Clause 27)
         be selected by the Agent.

27.2     Default Interest
         An Unpaid Sum shall bear interest during each Interest Period in
         respect thereof at the rate per annum which is one per cent. per
         annum above the percentage rate which would apply if such Unpaid Sum
         had been an Advance under the Term Facility (to the extent that the
         Unpaid Sum is owed to the Term Banks) or the Revolving Facility (to
         the extent that the Unpaid Sum is owed to the Revolving Banks) in the
         amount and currency of such Unpaid Sum and for the same Term or
         Interest Period, provided that if such Unpaid Sum relates to an
         Advance which became due and payable on a day other than the last day
         of a Term or Interest Period relating thereto:

         27.2.1   the first Interest Period applicable to such Unpaid Sum
                  shall be of a duration equal to the unexpired portion of the
                  current Term or Interest Period relating to that Advance;
                  and

         27.2.2   the percentage rate of interest applicable thereto from time
                  to time during such period shall be that which exceeds by
                  one per cent. the rate which would have

                  been applicable to it had it not so fallen due provided that
                  the Revolving Margin shall be, or be deemed to be:

                  (a)       prior to the date falling six months after the
                            Second Restatement Amendment Effective Date, 3.50
                            per cent. per annum; and

                  (b)       at all times thereafter 4.00 per cent. per annum.

27.3     Payment of Default Interest
         Any interest which shall have accrued under Clause 27.2 (Default
         Interest) in respect of an Unpaid Sum shall be due and payable and
         shall be paid by the Obligor owing such Unpaid Sum to the Finance
         Parties to whom such Unpaid Sum is owed on the last day of the
         Interest Period in respect thereof or on such other dates as the
         Agent may specify by notice to such Obligor.

27.4     Break Costs
         If any Bank or the Agent on its behalf receives or recovers all or
         any part of such Bank's share of an Advance or Unpaid Sum otherwise
         than on the last day of the Term or Interest Period relating thereto,
         the Borrowers (acting through the Parent) shall pay to the Agent on
         demand for account of such Bank an amount equal to the amount (if
         any) by which (a) the additional interest which would have been
         payable on the amount so received or recovered had it been received
         or recovered on the last day of that Term or Interest Period exceeds
         (b) the amount of interest which in the opinion of the Agent would
         have been payable to the Agent on the last day of that Term or
         Interest Period in respect of a deposit in the currency of the amount
         so received or recovered equal to the amount so received or recovered
         placed by it with a prime bank in London for a period starting on the
         Business Day following the date of such receipt or recovery and

28.      BORROWERS' INDEMNITIES

28.1     Borrowers' Indemnity
         The Borrowers, acting through the Parent, undertake to indemnify:

         28.1.1   each Finance Party against any cost, claim, loss, expense
                  (including legal fees) or liability together with any VAT
                  thereon, which it may sustain or incur as a consequence of
                  the occurrence of any Event of Default or any default by any
                  Obligor in the performance of any of the obligations
                  expressed to be assumed by it in the Finance Documents;

         28.1.2   each Bank against any cost or loss it may suffer under
                  Clause 26.5 (Banks' Liabilities for Costs) or Clause 33.6
                  (Indemnification); and

         28.1.3   each Bank against any cost or loss it may suffer or incur as
                  a result of its funding or making arrangements to fund its
                  portion of an Advance requested by any Borrower but not made
                  by reason of the operation of any one or more of the
                  provisions hereof.

                                    -121-
<page>

28.2     Currency Indemnity
         If any sum (a "Sum") due from an Obligor under the Finance Documents
         or any order or judgment given or made in relation thereto has to be
         converted from the currency (the "First Currency") in which such Sum
         is payable into another currency (the "Second Currency") for the
         purpose of:

         28.2.1   making or filing a claim or proof against such Obligor; or

         28.2.2   obtaining or enforcing an order or judgment in any court or
                  other tribunal,

         the Borrowers, acting through the Parent, shall indemnify each person
         to whom such Sum is due from and against any loss suffered or
         incurred as a result of any discrepancy between (a) the rate of
         exchange used for such purpose to convert such Sum from the First
         Currency into the Second Currency and (b) the rate or rates of
         exchange available to such person at the time of receipt of such Sum.

29.      CURRENCY OF ACCOUNT AND PAYMENT

         Sterling is the currency of account and payment for each and every
         sum at any time due from an Obligor hereunder, provided that:

         29.1.1   each payment in respect of costs and expenses shall be made
                  in the currency in which the same were incurred; and

         29.1.2   each payment pursuant to Clause 14.2 (Tax Indemnity), Clause
                  16.1 (Increased Costs) or Clause 28 (Borrowers' Indemnities)
                  shall be made in the currency specified by the party
                  claiming thereunder.

30.      PAYMENTS

30.1     Notification of Payments
         Without prejudice to the liability of each party hereto promptly to
         pay each amount owing by it hereunder on the due date therefor,
         whenever a payment is expected to be made by any of the parties
         hereto, the Agent shall, at least two Business Days prior to the
         expected date for such payment, notify all the parties hereto of the
         amount, currency and timing of such payment and the identity of the
         party liable to make such payment.

30.2     Payments to the Agent
         On each date on which this Agreement requires an amount to be paid by
         an Obligor or a Bank, such Obligor or, as the case may be, such Bank

         at such time and in such funds and to such account with such bank as
         the Agent shall (acting reasonably) specify from time to time.

30.3     Payments by the Agent
         30.3.1   Save as otherwise provided herein, each payment received by
                  the Agent pursuant to Clause 30.2 (Payments to the Agent)
                  shall:

                  (a)       in the case of a payment received for the account
                            of a Borrower, be made available by the Agent to
                            such Borrower by application:

                                    -122-
<page>

                            (i)     first, in or towards payment on the same
                                    day of any amount then due from such
                                    Borrower hereunder to the person from whom
                                    the amount was so received; and

                            (ii)    secondly, in or towards payment on the
                                    same day to the account of such Borrower
                                    with such bank in London as such Borrower
                                    shall have previously notified to the
                                    Agent for this purpose; and

                  (b)       in the case of any other payment, be made
                            available by the Agent to the person entitled to
                            receive such payment in accordance with this
                            Agreement (in the case of a Bank, for the account
                            of its Facility Office) for value the same day by
                            transfer to such account of such person with such
                            bank in London as such person shall have
                            previously notified to the Agent.

         30.3.2   A payment will be deemed to have been made by the Agent on
                  the date on which it is required to be made under this
                  Agreement if the Agent has, on or before that date, taken
                  steps to make that payment in accordance with the
                  regulations or operating procedures of the clearing or
                  settlement system used by the Agent in order to make the
                  payment.

30.4     No Set-off
         All payments required to be made by an Obligor hereunder shall be
         calculated without reference to any set-off or counterclaim and shall
         be made free and clear of and without any deduction for or on account
         of any set-off or counterclaim.

30.5     Clawback
         Where a sum is to be paid hereunder to the Agent for account of
         another person, the Agent shall not be obliged to make the same
         available to that other person until it has been able to establish to
         its satisfaction that it has actually received such sum, but if it
         does so and it proves to be the case that it had not actually
         received such sum, then the person to whom such sum was so made
         available shall on request refund the same to the Agent together with
         an amount sufficient to indemnify the Agent against any cost or loss
         it may have suffered or incurred by reason of its having paid out
         such sum prior to its having received such sum.

30.6     Partial Payments
         If and whenever a payment is made by an Obligor hereunder and the
         Agent receives an amount less than the due amount of such payment the
         Agent may apply the amount received towards the obligations of that
         Obligor under this Agreement in the following order:

         30.6.1   first, in or towards payment of any unpaid costs and
                  expenses of the Agent;

         30.6.2   secondly, in or towards payment pro rata of any accrued
                  interest or commitment commission due but unpaid;

         30.6.3   thirdly, in or towards payment pro rata of any principal due
                  but unpaid; and

         30.6.4   fourthly, in or towards payment pro rata of any other sum
                  due but unpaid.

                                    -123-
<page>

30.7     Variation of Partial Payments
         The order of partial payments set out in Clause 30.6 (Partial
         Payments) shall override any appropriation made by the Obligor to
         which the partial payment relates but the order set out in
         sub-clauses 30.6.2, 30.6.3 and 30.6.4 of Clause 30.6 (Partial
         Payments) may be varied if agreed by all the Banks.

30.8     Business Days
         30.8.1   Any payment which is due to be made on a day that is not a
                  Business Day shall be made on the next Business Day in the
                  same calendar month (if there is one) or the preceding
                  Business Day (if there is not).

         30.8.2   During any extension of the due date for payment of any
                  principal or an Unpaid Sum under this Agreement interest is
                  payable on the principal at the rate payable on the original
                  due date.

31.      SET-OFF

31.1     Contractual Set-off
         Each Obligor authorises each Bank, at any time any sum is due and
         payable hereunder and remains unpaid, to apply any credit balance to
         which such Obligor is entitled on any account of such Obligor with
         such Bank in satisfaction of any sum due and payable from such
         Obligor to such Bank under the Finance Documents but unpaid. For this
         purpose, each Bank is authorised to purchase with the moneys standing
         to the credit of any such account such other currencies as may be
         necessary to effect such application.

31.2     Set-off not Mandatory
         No Bank shall be obliged to exercise any right given to it by Clause
         31.1 (Contractual Set-off).

32.      SHARING

32.1     Payments to Banks
         If a Bank (a "Recovering Bank") applies any receipt or recovery from
         an Obligor to a payment due under this Agreement and such amount is
         received or recovered other than in accordance with Clause 30
         (Payments), then such Recovering Bank shall:

         32.1.1   notify the Agent of such receipt or recovery; and

         32.1.2   at the request of the Agent, promptly pay to the Agent an
                  amount (the "Sharing Payment") equal to such receipt or
                  recovery less any amount which the Agent determines may be
                  retained by such Recovering Bank as its share of any payment
                  to be made in accordance with Clause 30.6 (Partial
                  Payments).

32.2     Redistribution of Payments
         The Agent shall treat the Sharing Payment as if it had been paid by
         the relevant Obligor and distribute it between the Finance Parties
         (other than the Recovering Bank) in accordance with Clause 30.6
         (Partial Payments).

32.3     Recovering Bank's Rights
         The Recovering Bank will be subrogated into the rights of the parties
         which have shared in a redistribution pursuant to Clause 32.2
         (Redistribution of Payments) in respect of

                                    -124-
<page>

         the Sharing Payment (and the relevant Obligor shall be liable to the
         Recovering Bank in an amount equal to the Sharing Payment).

32.4     Repayable Recoveries
         If any part of the Sharing Payment received or recovered by a
         Recovering Bank becomes repayable and is repaid by such Recovering
         Bank, then:

         32.4.1   each party which has received a share of such Sharing
                  Payment pursuant to Clause 32.2 (Redistribution of Payments)
                  shall, upon request of the Agent, pay to the Agent for
                  account of such Recovering Bank an amount equal to its share
                  of such Sharing Payment; and

         32.4.2   such Recovering Bank's rights of subrogation in respect of
                  any reimbursement shall be cancelled and the relevant
                  Obligor will be liable to the reimbursing party for the
                  amount so reimbursed.

32.5     Exception
         This Clause 32 shall not apply if the Recovering Bank would not,
         after making any payment pursuant hereto, have a valid and
         enforceable claim against the relevant Obligor.

32.6     Recoveries Through Legal Proceedings
         If any Bank intends to commence any action in any court it shall give
         prior notice to the Agent and the other Banks. If any Bank shall
         commence any action in any court to enforce its rights hereunder and,
         as a result thereof or in connection therewith, receives any amount,
         then such Bank shall not be required to share any portion of such
         amount with any Bank which has the legal right to, but does not, join
         in such action or commence and diligently prosecute a separate action
         to enforce its rights in another court.

32.7     Secured Hedging Agreements
         The Parent shall provide the Agent with, as soon as is reasonably
         practicable after the same are entered into, copies of the Secured
         Hedging Agreements entered into by either it or any member of the UK
         Group pursuant to Clause 22.31 (Hedging). The Parent and each Hedge
         Counterparty shall ensure that each Secured Hedging Agreement to
         which (a) (in the case of the Parent) it or any other member of the
         UK Group is a party or (b) (in the case of a Hedge Counterparty) it
         is a party:

         32.7.1   provides for "two-way payments" in the event of a
                  termination of a hedging transaction entered into pursuant
                  to a Secured Hedging Agreement whether upon a termination
                  event or an event of default (each as defined in the Secured
                  Hedging Agreement), meaning that the defaulting party under
                  that Secured Hedging Agreement will be entitled to receive
                  payment under the relevant termination provisions if the net
                  replacement value of all terminated transactions effected
                  under the Hedging Agreement is in its favour; and

         32.7.2   includes as an event of default (as defined in the Secured
                  Hedging Agreement) an Event of Default.

                                    -125-
<page>

32.8     Termination of Secured Hedging Agreements
         Each Hedge Counterparty shall:

         32.8.1   if (a) any hedging transaction under any Secured Hedging
                  Agreement to which it is party is terminated, (b) a
                  settlement amount or other amount falls due from it to any
                  member of the UK Group under such a Secured Hedging
                  Agreement and (c) the Security has become, and remains at
                  the proposed date of payment enforceable, pay such
                  settlement amount to the Security Trustee; and

         32.8.2   unless the Agent otherwise instructs it, exercise any rights
                  it may have to terminate the hedging transactions under the
                  Secured Hedging Agreements to which it is party as soon as
                  is reasonably practicable after the date on which the Agent
                  declares all or any part of the Advances to be immediately
                  due and payable in accordance with either Clause 23.17
                  (Acceleration and Cancellation) or Clause 23.18 (Advances
                  Due on Demand).

32.9     Rights of Hedge Counterparties
         Whilst any Obligor has any actual or contingent liabilities under the
         Finance Documents, except with the prior consent of the Agent (acting
         on the instructions of an Instructing Group), no Hedge Counterparty
         will:

         32.9.1   demand or receive payment, prepayment (other than a
                  prepayment arising due to the prepayment of an Advance
                  permitted by this Agreement), repayment, or any distribution
                  in respect of or on account of any of the Hedging
                  Liabilities in cash or in kind or apply any money or
                  property in or towards the discharge of any Hedging
                  Liabilities except for:

                  (a)       scheduled payments arising under the terms of the
                            Secured Hedging Agreements; and

                  (b)       the proceeds of enforcement of the Security
                            Documents received and applied in the order
                            permitted by the Security Trust Agreement;

         32.9.2   exercise any right it might otherwise have pursuant to any
                  Secured Hedging Agreement to terminate any hedging
                  transactions under such Secured Hedging Agreement or to
                  refuse to make any payment due from it under such hedging
                  transactions until the Agent declares all or any part of the
                  Advances to be immediately due and payable in accordance
                  with either Clause 23.17 (Acceleration and Cancellation) or
                  Clause 23.18 (Advances Due on Demand);

         32.9.3   discharge all or any part of the Hedging Liabilities by
                  set-off, any right of combination of accounts or otherwise
                  except if and to the extent that those Hedging Liabilities
                  are permitted to be paid under sub-clause 32.9.1(a); or

         32.9.4   take, accept or receive the benefit of any Encumbrance or
                  guarantee in respect of the Hedging Liabilities other than
                  under (a) the Finance Documents or (b) any other Encumbrance
                  or guarantee granted for the full benefit of the Finance

32.10    Amendment of Secured Hedging Agreements
         Except with the prior written consent of the Agent (acting on the
         instructions of an Instructing Group), neither a member of the UK
         Group nor a Hedge Counterparty will amend, vary, supplement or allow
         to be superseded any provision of the Secured Hedging Agreements
         which would result in:

         32.10.1  any provision in the Secured Hedging Agreements being
                  amended unless the Hedge Counterparty concerned, acting
                  reasonably and in good faith, certifies to the Agent that it
                  considers such amendment does not impose restrictions or
                  obligations or conditions on any member of the UK Group
                  which are more onerous than those originally provided for in
                  the Secured Hedging Agreements;

         32.10.2  any payment under the Secured Hedging Agreements being
                  required to be made by a member of the UK Group earlier than
                  the date originally provided for in the Secured Hedging
                  Agreements (except where that payment is made as a result of
                  the prepayment of an Advance permitted by this Agreement);
                  or

         32.10.3  any member of the UK Group becoming liable to make an
                  additional payment (or increase an existing payment) under
                  any of the Secured Hedging Agreements, where such liability
                  does not arise from the original provisions of the Secured
                  Hedging Agreements.

33.      THE AGENT, THE ARRANGERS AND THE BANKS

33.1     Appointment of the Agent
         Each of the Arrangers and the Banks hereby appoints the Agent to act
         as its agent in connection herewith and authorises the Agent to
         exercise such rights, powers, authorities and discretions as are
         specifically delegated to the Agent by the terms hereof together with
         all such rights, powers, authorities and discretions as are
         reasonably incidental thereto.

33.2     Agent's Discretions
         The Agent may:

         33.2.1   assume, unless it has, in its capacity as agent for the
                  Banks, received notice to the contrary from any other party
                  hereto, that (a) any representation made or deemed to be
                  made by the Parent, New NTL or an Obligor in connection with
                  the Finance Documents is true, (b) no Event of Default or
                  Potential Event of Default has occurred, (c) neither the
                  Parent, New NTL nor any Obligor is in breach of or default
                  under its obligations under the Finance Documents and (d)
                  any right, power, authority or discretion vested herein upon
                  an Instructing Group, the Banks or any other person or group
                  of persons has not been exercised;

         33.2.2   assume that (a) the Facility Office of each Bank is that
                  notified to it by such Bank in writing and (b) the
                  information provided by each Bank pursuant to Clause 33.15
                  (Banks' Mandatory Cost Details), Clause 40 (Notices) and
                  Schedule 11 (Mandatory Costs) is true and correct in all
                  respects until it has received from such Bank notice of a
                  change to the Facility Office or any such

                                    -127-
<page>

                  information and act upon any such notice until the same is
                  superseded by a further notice;

         33.2.3   engage and pay for the advice or services of any lawyers,
                  accountants, surveyors or other experts whose advice or
                  services may to it seem necessary, expedient or desirable
                  and rely upon any advice so obtained;

         33.2.4   rely as to any matters of fact which might reasonably be
                  expected to be within the knowledge of an Obligor upon a
                  certificate signed by or on behalf of such Obligor;

         33.2.5   rely upon any communication or document believed by it to be
                  genuine;

         33.2.6   refrain from exercising any right, power or discretion
                  vested in it as agent hereunder unless and until instructed
                  by an Instructing Group as to whether or not such right,
                  power or discretion is to be exercised and, if it is to be
                  exercised, as to the manner in which it should be exercised;

         33.2.7   refrain from acting in accordance with any instructions of
                  an Instructing Group to begin any legal action or proceeding
                  arising out of or in connection with the Finance Documents
                  until it shall have received such security as it may require
                  (whether by way of payment in advance or otherwise) for all
                  costs, claims, losses, expenses (including legal fees) and
                  liabilities together with any VAT thereon which it will or
                  may expend or incur in complying with such instructions; and

         33.2.8   assume (unless it has specific notice to the contrary) that
                  any notice or request made by the Parent is made on behalf
                  of all the Obligors.

33.3     Agent's Obligations
         The Agent shall:

         33.3.1   promptly inform each Bank of the contents of any written
                  notice or document received by it in its capacity as Agent
                  from the Parent, New NTL or an Obligor under the Finance
                  Documents;

         33.3.2   promptly notify each Bank of the occurrence of any Event of
                  Default or any default by an Obligor in the due performance
                  of or compliance with its obligations under the Finance
                  Documents of which the Agent has notice from any other party
                  hereto;

         33.3.3   promptly notify each Bank of the occurrence of an Event of
                  Default under Clause 23.1 (Failure to Pay);

         33.3.4   promptly notify each Bank of all or any part of the Advances
                  being declared to be immediately due and payable in
                  accordance with either Clause 23.17 (Acceleration and
                  Cancellation) or Clause 23.18 (Advances Due on Demand);

         33.3.5   save as otherwise provided herein, act as agent hereunder in
                  accordance with any instructions given to it by an
                  Instructing Group (or if specifically provided for in the
                  Finance Documents, Term Instructing Group or Revolving
                  Instructing

                                    -128-
<page>

                  Group as the case may be), which instructions shall be
                  binding on the Arrangers and the Banks;

         33.3.6   if so instructed by an Instructing Group (or if specifically
                  provided for in the Finance Documents, Term Instructing
                  Group or Revolving Instructing Group as the case may be),
                  refrain from exercising any right, power or discretion
                  vested in it as agent hereunder; and

         33.3.7   unless it has a Bank's consent, refrain from acting on
                  behalf of that Bank in any legal or arbitration proceedings
                  relating to any Finance Document.

         The Agent's duties under the Finance Documents are solely mechanical
         and administrative in nature.

33.4     Excluded Obligations
         Notwithstanding anything to the contrary expressed or implied herein,
         neither the Agent nor an Arranger shall:

         33.4.1   be bound to enquire as to (a) whether or not any
                  representation made or deemed to be made by the Parent, New
                  NTL or an Obligor in connection with the Finance Documents
                  is true, (b) the occurrence or otherwise of any Event of
                  Default or Potential Event of Default, (c) the performance
                  by either the Parent, New NTL or an Obligor of its
                  obligations under the Finance Documents or (d) any breach of
                  or default by either the Parent, New NTL or an Obligor of or
                  under its obligations under the Finance Documents;

         33.4.2   be bound to account to any Bank for any sum or the profit
                  element of any sum received by it for its own account;

         33.4.3   be bound to disclose to any other person any information
                  relating to any member of the Group if (a) such information
                  is confidential or (b) such disclosure would or might in its
                  reasonable opinion constitute a breach of any law or a
                  breach of fiduciary duty;

         33.4.4   be under any obligations other than those for which express
                  provision is made herein; or

         33.4.5   be or be deemed to be a fiduciary for any other party
                  hereto.

33.5     Delegation
         The Agent may delegate, transfer or assign to any of its holding
         companies, subsidiaries or subsidiaries of any of its holding
         companies all or any of the rights, powers, authorities and
         discretions vested in it under the Finance Documents and the
         performance of its duties in accordance therewith, and such
         delegation, transfer or assignment may be made upon such terms and
         subject to such conditions (including the power to sub-delegate) and
         subject to such regulations as the Agent may think fit (and the term
         "Agent" as used in this Agreement shall include any such delegate).

33.6     Indemnification
         Each Bank shall, in its Proportion, from time to time on demand by
         the Agent, indemnify the Agent against any and all costs, claims,
         losses, expenses (including legal fees) and

                                    -129-
<page>

         liabilities together with any VAT thereon which the Agent may incur,
         otherwise than by reason of its own gross negligence or wilful
         misconduct, in acting in its capacity as agent under the Finance
         Documents (other than any which have been reimbursed by the Borrowers
         pursuant to Clause 28.1 (Borrowers' Indemnity)).

33.7     Exclusion of Liabilities
         Each Revolving Bank which became a party hereto prior to the Second
         Restatement Amendment Effective Date confirmed that it has read the
         Notice to Recipients in the Information Memorandum, that it has
         complied with the Recipients' Obligations (as set out in the Notice
         to Recipients) and, accordingly, that it entered into this Agreement
         on the basis of the Notice to Recipients. Similarly, each of the
         Revolving Banks which became a party hereto prior to the Second
         Restatement Amendment Effective Date accepted that the Notice to
         Recipients in the Information Memorandum was applicable also to the
         Agent as if the Agent had been named in addition to the Arrangers in
         the Important Notice.

         Each of the Banks accepts that it entered into this Agreement in
         reliance only on the representations of the Parent, New NTL and the
         Obligors in this Agreement and on its own investigations, that it has
         not relied on the Arrangers and that, except as set out below, it
         neither has nor will have any claims against the Arrangers arising
         from or in connection with this Agreement.

         Except in the case of gross negligence or wilful default, neither the
         Agent nor any Arranger accepts any responsibility to any of the
         Banks:

         33.7.1   for the adequacy, accuracy and/or completeness of the
                  Information Memorandum or any other information supplied by
                  the Agent or the Arrangers, by the Parent, New NTL or an
                  Obligor or by any other person in connection with the
                  Finance Documents or any other agreement, arrangement or
                  document entered into, made or executed in anticipation of,
                  pursuant to or in connection with the Finance Documents;

         33.7.2   for the legality, validity, effectiveness, adequacy or
                  enforceability of the Finance Documents or any other
                  agreement, arrangement or document entered into, made or
                  executed in anticipation of, pursuant to or in connection
                  with the Finance Documents; or

         33.7.3   for the exercise of, or the failure to exercise, any
                  judgement, discretion or power given to any of them by or in
                  connection with the Finance Documents or any other
                  agreement, arrangement or document entered into, made or
                  executed in anticipation of, pursuant to or in connection
                  with the Finance Documents.

         Accordingly, neither the Agent nor an Arranger shall be under any
         liability (whether in negligence or otherwise) in respect of such
         matters, save in the case of gross negligence or wilful misconduct.

33.8     No Actions
         Each of the Banks agrees that it will not assert or seek to assert
         against any director, officer or employee of the Agent or the
         Arrangers any claim it might have against any of

                                    -130-
<page>

         them in respect of the matters referred to in Clause 33.7 (Exclusion
         of Liabilities). Any third party referred to in this Clause 33.8 may
         enjoy the benefit of, or enforce the terms of, this Clause 33.8 in
         accordance with the provisions of the Contracts (Rights of Third
         Parties) Act 1999.

33.9     Business with the Group
         The Agent and the Arrangers may accept deposits from, lend money to
         and generally engage in any kind of banking or other business with
         any member of the Group whether or not it may or does lead to a
         conflict with the interests of any of the Banks. Similarly, the Agent
         or the Arrangers may undertake business with or for others even
         though it may lead to a conflict with the interests of any of the
         Banks.

33.10    Resignation
         The Agent may resign its appointment hereunder at any time without
         assigning any reason therefor by giving not less than thirty days'
         prior notice to that effect to each of the other parties hereto,
         provided that no such resignation shall be effective until a
         successor for the Agent is appointed in accordance with the
         succeeding provisions of this Clause 33.

33.11    Removal of Agent
         An Instructing Group may, after consultation with the Parent, remove
         the Agent from its role as agent under the Finance Documents by
         giving notice to that effect to each of the other parties hereto.
         Such removal shall take effect only when a successor to the Agent is
         appointed in accordance with the terms of the Finance Documents.

33.12    Successor Agent
         If the Agent gives notice of its resignation pursuant to Clause 33.10
         (Resignation) or it is removed pursuant to Clause 33.11 (Removal of
         Agent), then any reputable and experienced bank or other financial
         institution may, with the prior consent of the Parent be appointed as
         a successor to the Agent by an Instructing Group during the period of
         such notice but, if no such successor is so appointed, the Agent may
         appoint such a successor itself.

33.13    Rights and Obligations
         If a successor to the Agent is appointed under the provisions of
         Clause 33.12 (Successor Agent), then (a) the retiring or departing
         Agent shall be discharged from any further obligation under the
         Finance Documents but shall remain entitled to the benefit of the
         provisions of this Clause 33 and (b) its successor and each of the
         other parties hereto shall have the same rights and obligations
         amongst themselves as they would have had if such successor had
         originally been a party hereto.

33.14    Own Responsibility
         It is understood and agreed by each Bank that at all times it has
         itself been, and will continue to be, solely responsible for making
         its own independent appraisal of and investigation into all risks
         arising under or in connection with the Finance Documents including,
         but not limited to:

         33.14.1  the financial condition, creditworthiness, condition,
                  affairs, status and nature of each member of the Group;

                                    -131-
<page>

         33.14.2  the legality, validity, effectiveness, adequacy and
                  enforceability of the Finance Documents and any other
                  agreement, arrangement or document entered into, made or
                  executed in anticipation of, pursuant to or in connection
                  with the Finance Documents;

         33.14.3  whether such Bank has recourse, and the nature and extent of
                  that recourse, against an Obligor or any other person or any
                  of their respective assets under or in connection with the
                  Finance Documents, the transactions therein contemplated or
                  any other agreement, arrangement or document entered into,
                  made or executed in anticipation of, pursuant to or in
                  connection with the Finance Documents; and

         33.14.4  the adequacy, accuracy and/or completeness of the
                  Information Memorandum and any other information provided by
                  the Agent or the Arrangers, the Parent, New NTL or an
                  Obligor or by any other person in connection with the
                  Finance Documents, the transactions contemplated therein or
                  any other agreement, arrangement or document entered into,
                  made or executed in anticipation of, pursuant to or in
                  connection with the Finance Documents.

         Accordingly, each Bank acknowledges to the Agent and the Arrangers
         that it has not relied on and will not hereafter rely on the Agent
         and the Arrangers or any of them in respect of any of these matters.

33.15    Banks' Mandatory Cost Details
         Each Bank will supply the Agent with such information and in such
         detail as the Agent may require in order to calculate the Mandatory
         Cost Rate in accordance with Schedule 11 (Mandatory Costs).

33.16    Receipt of Information by the Agent
         Any information or document received by the Agent shall only be
         treated as having been received by the Agent if the same has been
         delivered to the Agent's agency department in accordance with Clause
         40 (Notices). Accordingly, any information or documents received by
         the Agent other than by its agency department in accordance with
         Clause 40 (Notices) is not by reason of that receipt to be treated as
         having been received by the Agent unless and until the Agent's agency
         department has received actual notice of the same in accordance with
         such Clause. Save as expressly set out in this Agreement and, unless
         the Agent's agency department shall have received information or
         documents in accordance with Clause 40 (Notices), the Agent shall
         have no duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to
         disclose, any information or documents, that are communicated to or
         obtained by the Agent.

34.      ASSIGNMENTS AND TRANSFERS

         34.3.2   The prior written consent of the Parent (which shall be
                  deemed to be given on its own behalf and on behalf of the
                  other Obligors) is required for an assignment or transfer by
                  a Bank unless the assignment or transfer is to:

                  (a)       another Bank; or

                  (b)       any subsidiary or holding company (or to any
                            subsidiary of any holding company) of the
                            transferring Bank.

         34.3.3   The Parent's consent must not be (a) unreasonably delayed or
                  withheld or (b) withheld solely because the assignment or
                  transfer may result in an increase to the Mandatory Cost
                  Rate.

34.4     Assignments by Banks
         If any Bank assigns all or any of its rights and benefits under the
         Finance Documents in accordance with Clause 34.3 (Assignments and
         Transfers by Banks), then, unless and until the assignee has
         delivered a notice to the Agent confirming in favour of the Agent,
         the Arrangers and the other Banks that it shall be under the same
         obligations towards each of them as it would have been under if it
         had been an original party hereto as a Bank (whereupon such assignee
         shall become a party hereto as a "Bank"), the Agent, the Arrangers
         and the other Banks shall not be obliged to recognise such assignee
         as having the rights against each of them which it would have had if
         it had been such a party hereto.

34.5     Transfers by Banks
         If any Bank wishes to transfer all or any of its rights, benefits
         and/or obligations under the Finance Documents as contemplated in
         Clause 34.3 (Assignments and Transfers by Banks), then such transfer
         may be effected by the delivery to the Agent of a duly completed
         Transfer Certificate executed by such Bank and the relevant
         Transferee in which event, on the later of the Transfer Date
         specified in such Transfer Certificate and the fifth Business Day
         after (or such earlier Business Day endorsed by the Agent on such
         Transfer Certificate falling on or after) the date of delivery of
         such Transfer Certificate to the Agent:

         34.5.1   to the extent that in such Transfer Certificate the Bank
                  party thereto seeks to transfer by novation its rights,
                  benefits and obligations under the Finance Documents, the
                  Parent, New NTL and each of the Obligors and such Bank shall
                  be released from further obligations towards one another
                  under the Finance Documents and their respective rights
                  against one another shall be cancelled

                                    -133-
<page>

                  (such rights and obligations being referred to in this
                  Clause 34.5 as "discharged rights and obligations");

         34.5.2   the Parent, New NTL and each of the Obligors and the
                  Transferee party thereto shall assume obligations towards
                  one another and/or acquire rights against one another which
                  differ from such discharged rights and obligations only
                  insofar as the Parent, New NTL, the Obligors and such
                  Transferee have assumed and/or acquired the same in place of
                  the Parent, New NTL, the Obligors and such Bank;

         34.5.3   the Agent, the Arrangers, such Transferee and the other
                  Banks shall acquire the same rights and benefits and assume
                  the same obligations between themselves as they would have
                  acquired and assumed had such Transferee been an original
                  party hereto as a Bank with the rights, benefits and/or
                  obligations acquired or assumed by it as a result of such
                  transfer and to that extent the Agent, the Arrangers and the
                  relevant Bank shall each be released from further
                  obligations to each other under the Finance Documents; and

         34.5.4   such Transferee shall become a party hereto as a "Bank".

34.6     No Increased Obligations
         If:

         34.6.1   a Bank assigns or transfers any of its rights or obligations
                  under the Finance Documents or changes its Facility Office;
                  and

         34.6.2   as a result of circumstances existing at the date of the
                  assignment, transfer or change of Facility Office, an
                  Obligor would be obliged to make a payment to the assignee,
                  Transferee or the Bank acting through its new Facility
                  Office under Clause 14.1 (Tax Gross-Up), 14.2 (Tax
                  Indemnity) or Clause 16 (Increased Costs),

         then the assignee, Transferee or the Bank acting through its new
         Facility Office shall only be entitled to receive payment under those
         Clauses to the same extent as the assignor, transferor or the Bank
         acting through its previous Facility Office would have been if the
         assignment, transfer or change had not occurred.

34.7     Assignment and Transfer Fees
         On the date upon which an assignment takes effect pursuant to Clause
         34.4 (Assignments by Banks) or a transfer takes effect pursuant to

         shall pay to the Agent for its own account a fee of (pound)1,000.

34.8     Disclosure of Information
         Any Bank may disclose to any person:

         34.8.1   to (or through) whom such Bank assigns or transfers (or may

                  made by reference to, the Finance Documents or any Obligor;

         34.8.3   to whom information may be required to be disclosed by any
                  applicable law; or

         34.8.4   any of its subsidiaries or any holding company (or any
                  subsidiary of a holding company),

         such information about the Parent, New NTL, any Obligor or the Group

43.      GOVERNING LAW

         This Agreement is governed by English law.

44.      JURISDICTION

44.1     English Courts
         The courts of England have exclusive jurisdiction to settle any
         dispute (a "Dispute") arising out of or in connection with this
         Agreement (including a dispute regarding the existence, validity or
         termination of this Agreement or the consequences of its nullity).

44.2     Convenient Forum
         The parties agree that the courts of England are the most appropriate
         and convenient courts to settle Disputes between them and,
         accordingly, that they will not argue to the contrary.

44.3     Non-Exclusive Jurisdiction
         This Clause 44 is for the benefit of the Finance Parties only. As a
         result and notwithstanding Clause 44.1 (English Courts), it does not
         prevent any Finance Party from taking proceedings relating to a
         Dispute ("Proceedings") in any other courts with jurisdiction. To the
         extent allowed by law, the Finance Parties may take concurrent
         Proceedings in any number of jurisdictions.

44.4     Service of Process
         New NTL and each Obligor which is not incorporated in England and
         Wales agrees that the documents which start any Proceedings and any
         other documents required to be served in relation to those
         Proceedings may be served on it by service of such documents on NTL
         Group Limited at NTL House, Bartley Wood Business Park, Hook,
         Hampshire RG27 9UP (marked for the attention of Robert Mackenzie) or,
         if different, its registered office.

         If NTL Group Limited ceases to have a place of business in Great
         Britain or, as the case may be, its appointment ceases to be
         effective, New NTL and each Obligor which is not incorporated in
         England and Wales shall immediately appoint another person in England
         to accept service of process on its behalf in England. If New NTL or
         an Obligor which is not incorporated in England and Wales fails to do
         so (and such failure continues for a period of not less than fourteen
         days), the Agent shall be entitled to appoint such a person by notice
         to New NTL or such Obligor (as the case may be). Nothing contained
         herein shall restrict the right to serve process in any other manner
         allowed by law. This Clause 44.4 applies to Proceedings in England
         and to Proceedings elsewhere.

To:      J.P. Morgan Europe Limited

From:    NTL Communications Limited (the "Parent")

Dated:

Dear Sirs,

1.       We refer to an agreement dated 30 May 2000 from time to time amended,
         varied, novated, supplemented and restated and originally made
         between, among others, NTL Business Limited as the Pre-Novation
         Borrower (whose obligations have been novated to NTL Investment
         Holdings Limited as Post-Novation Borrower), J.P. Morgan Europe
         Limited (formerly known as Chase Manhattan International Limited) as
         agent and the financial institutions defined therein as Banks (the
         "Credit Agreement").

2.       Terms defined in the Credit Agreement shall bear the same meaning
         herein.

3.       [We declare that [name of Borrower] is under no actual or contingent
         obligation under any Finance Document in its capacity as a
         Borrower.]*

4.       Pursuant to Clause [36.3 (Resignation of a Borrower)]/[37.3
         (Resignation of a Guarantor)] we hereby request that [name of
         Obligor] shall cease to be a [Borrower]/[Guarantor] under the Credit
         Agreement.

5.       [The aggregate EBITDA of the remaining Guarantors (in each case
         calculated on an unconsolidated basis) for the immediately preceding
         four complete Financial Quarters ending on [Quarter Date] was such as
         to satisfy sub-clause 22.25.1 of Clause 22.25 (Guarantors).]**

                                 SCHEDULE 11

                                Mandatory Costs

1.       The Mandatory Cost Rate is an addition to the interest rate to
         compensate Banks for the cost of compliance with (a) the requirements
         of the Bank of England and/or the Financial Services Authority (or,
         in either case, any other authority which replaces all or any of its
         functions) or (b) the requirements of the European Central Bank.

2.       On the first day of each Term or Interest Period (or as soon as
         possible thereafter) the Agent shall calculate, as a percentage rate,
         a rate (the "additional costs rate") for each Bank, in accordance
         with the paragraphs set out below. The Mandatory Cost Rate applicable
         to the relevant Advance will be calculated by the Agent as a weighted
         average of the Banks' additional costs rate rounded to five decimal
         places (weighted in proportion to the percentage participation of
         each Bank in the relevant Advance) and will be expressed as a
         percentage rate per annum.

3.       The additional costs rate for any Bank lending from a Facility Office
         in a Participating Member State will be the percentage notified by
         that Bank to the Agent. This percentage will be certified by that
         Bank in its notice to the Agent to be its reasonable determination of
         the cost (expressed as a percentage of that Bank's participation in
         all Advances made from that Facility Office) of complying with the
         minimum reserve requirements of the European Central Bank in respect
         of loans made from that Facility Office.

4.       The additional cost rate for any Bank lending from a Facility Office
         in the United Kingdom will be calculated by the Agent as follows:



                             AB + C(B-D)+E x 0.01
                    -------------------------------------
                                  100 - (A+C)


Where:

A        is the percentage of Eligible Liabilities (assuming these to be in
         excess of any stated minimum) which that Bank is from time to time
         required to maintain as an interest free cash ratio deposit with the
         Bank of England to comply with cash ratio requirements.

B        is the percentage rate of interest (excluding the Revolving Margin
         or, as the case may be, the Term Margin and the Mandatory Cost Rate
         and, if the Advance is an Unpaid Sum, the additional rate of interest
         specified in Clause 27.2 (Default Interest)) payable for the relevant
         Term on the Revolving Loan or, as the case may be, the relevant
         Interest Period on the Term Loan.

C        is the percentage (if any) of Eligible Liabilities which that Bank is
         required from time to time to maintain as interest bearing Special
         Deposits with the Bank of England.

D        is the percentage rate per annum payable by the Bank of England to
         the Agent on interest bearing Special Deposits.

                                     174
<PAGE>
E        is designed to compensate Banks for amounts payable under the Fees
         Rules and is calculated by the Agent as being the average of the most
         recent rates of charge supplied by the Reference Banks to the Agent
         pursuant to paragraph 7 below and expressed in pounds per
         (pound)1,000,000.

5.       For the purposes of this Schedule:

         (a)      "Eligible Liabilities" and "Special Deposits" have the
                  meanings given to them from time to time under or pursuant
                  to the Bank of England Act 1998 or (as may be appropriate)
                  by the Bank of England;

         (b)      "Fees Rules" means the rules on periodic fees contained in
                  the FSA Supervision Manual or such other law or regulation
                  as may be in force from time to time in respect of the
                  payment of fees for the acceptance of deposits;

         (c)      "Fee Tariffs" means the fee tariffs specified in the Fees
                  Rules under the activity group A.1 Deposit acceptors
                  (ignoring any minimum fee or zero rated fee required
                  pursuant to the Fees Rules but taking into account any
                  applicable discount rate); and

         (d)      "Tariff Base" has the meaning given to it in, and will be
                  calculated in accordance with, the Fees Rules.

6.       In application of the above formula, A, B, C and D will be included
         in the formula as percentages (i.e. 5 per cent. will be included in
         the formula as 5 and not as 0.05). A negative result obtained by
         subtracting D from B shall be taken as zero. The resulting figures
         shall be rounded to four decimal places.

7.       If requested by the Agent, each Reference Bank shall, as soon as
         practicable after publication by the Financial Services Authority,
         supply to the Agent, the rate of charge payable by that Reference
         Bank to the Financial Services Authority pursuant to the Fees Rules
         in respect of the relevant financial year of the Financial Services
         Authority (calculated for this purpose by that Reference Bank as
         being the average of the Fee Tariffs applicable to that Reference
         Bank for that financial year) and expressed in pounds per
         (pound)1,000,000 of the Tariff Base of that Reference Bank.

8.       Each Bank shall supply any information required by the Agent for the
         purpose of calculating its additional costs rate. In particular, but
         without limitation, each Bank shall supply the following information
         in writing on or prior to the date on which it becomes a Bank:

         (a)      its jurisdiction of incorporation and the jurisdiction of
                  its Facility Office; and

         (b)      such other information that the Agent may reasonably require
                  for such purpose.

         Each Bank shall promptly notify the Agent in writing of any change to
         the information provided by it pursuant to this paragraph.

9.       The percentages or rates of charge of each Bank for the purpose of A
         and C above and the rates of charge for each Reference Bank for the
         purposes of E above shall be determined by the Agent based upon the
         information supplied to it pursuant to


                                     175
<PAGE>
         paragraphs 7 and 8 above and on the assumption that, unless a Bank
         notifies the Agent to the contrary, each Bank's obligations in relation
         to cash ratio deposits and Special Deposits are the same as those of a
         typica l bank from its jurisdiction of incorporation with a Facility
         Office in the same jurisdiction as its Facility Office.

10.      The Agent shall have no liability to any person if such determination
         results in an additional costs rate which over or under compensates
         any Bank and shall be entitled to assume that the information
         provided by any Bank or Reference Bank pursuant to paragraphs 3, 7
         and 8 above is true and correct in all respects.

11.      The Agent shall distribute the additional amounts received pursuant
         to the Mandatory Cost Rate to the relevant Banks on the basis of the
         additional cost rate incurred by each Bank, as calculated in
         accordance with the above formula and based on the information
         provided by each Bank and each Reference Bank pursuant to paragraphs
         3, 7 and 8 above.

12.      Any determination by the Agent pursuant to this Schedule in relation
         to a formula, the Mandatory Cost Rate, an additional costs rate or
         any amount payable to a Bank shall, in the absence of manifest error,
         be conclusive and binding on all of the parties hereto.

13.      The Agent may from time to time, after consultation with the Parent
         (on behalf of the Obligors) and the Banks, determine and notify to
         all parties any amendments or variations which are required to be
         made to this Schedule in order to comply with any change in law,
         regulation or any requirements from time to time imposed by the Bank
         of England, the Financial Services Authority or the European Central
         Bank (or, in either case, any other authority which replaces all or
         any of its functions) and any such determination shall, in the
         absence of manifest error, be conclusive and binding on all the
         parties hereto.

                  assumptions upon which the forecasts and projections
                  contained in the Business Plan are based to be fair and
                  reasonable in all material respects; and

         (iii)    confirms that the factual information contained in the
                  Information Memorandum and any other factual written
                  information supplied by any member of the UK Group or any
                  member of the Target Group (in the latter case, supplied

                  unattainable, any of the forecasts or projections set out in
                  the latest Budget delivered under Clause 17.5 (Budgets);

         (ii)     believes (having made all reasonable enquiries) the
                  assumptions, upon which the forecasts and projections in
                  relation to the CWC ConsumerCo Business contained in the
                  latest Budget delivered under Clause 17.5 (Budgets) are

         No Environmental Claim has been commenced or (to the best of its
         knowledge and belief) is threatened against any member of the UK
         Group or any member of the Target Group where such claim would be
         reasonably likely, if determined against such member of the UK Group
         or the Target Group, to have a Material Adverse Effect.

(r)      No Encumbrances
         Save (in each case) for Permitted Encumbrances, no Encumbrance exists
         over all or any of its present or future revenues or assets and, in

                  instrument or treaty to which it is party or which is
                  binding upon it or any of its assets in a manner that could
                  reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect;

         (ii)     conflict with its constitutive documents and rules and
                  regulations; or

         (iii)    conflict with any applicable law.

         authorisations and consents (each an "approval") required for the
         conduct of its business as carried on from time to time, and all such
         approvals are valid and subsisting save in any such case where
         failure to obtain such an approval or the invalidity of such an
         approval or its failure to subsist could not reasonably be expected
         to have a Material Adverse Effect and to the best of its knowledge
         and belief (having made, with respect to the UK Group only, due and
         careful enquiry) there has been no act or

                                     199
<PAGE>

         omission on the part of it or, as the case may be, any Target Group
         member or any UK Group member, which is likely to give rise to the
         enforcement, revocation, material amendment, suspension, withdrawal
         or avoidance of any of the approvals or any of the material terms or
         conditions thereof, which enforcement, revocation, amendment,
         withdrawal, suspension or avoidance could reasonably be expected to
         have a Material Adverse Effect.

         nor, in the case of the Original Borrower and the CWC Parent, any
         member of the Target Group, has to the best of its knowledge and
         belief (having made with respect to the UK Group only, due and

                  purports to evidence a security interest, accurately

                  and each security interest ranks in priority (save in
                  respect of, if and to the extent applicable, Permitted

                  not subject to any option to purchase or similar rights and
                  the constitutional documents of any such UK Group or Target
                  Group member do not and could not restrict or inhibit
                  (whether absolutely, partly, under a discretionary power or
                  otherwise) any transfer of such shares pursuant to
                  enforcement of the Security Documents.

         material licences (including, without limitation, the Licences),
         permissions, authorisations and consents (each an "approval")
         required for the conduct of its business as carried on from time to
         time, and all such approvals are valid and subsisting save in any
         such case where failure to obtain such an approval or the invalidity
         of such an approval or its failure to subsist could not reasonably be
         expected to have a Material Adverse Effect and to the best of its
         knowledge and belief (having made,

                                     212
<PAGE>

         with respect to the UK Group only, due and careful enquiry) there has
         been no act or omission on the part of it or, as the case may be, any
         Target Group member or any UK Group member, which is likely to give
         rise to the enforcement, revocation, material amendment, suspension,
         withdrawal or avoidance of any of the approvals or any of the
         material terms or conditions thereof, which enforcement, revocation,
         amendment, withdrawal, suspension or avoidance could reasonably be
         expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

(u)      Government or Regulatory Authority Inquiry
         Neither it nor, in the case of the Parent, any member of the UK Group
         nor, in the case of the Pre-Novation Borrower and the CWC Parent, any
         member of the Target Group, has to the best of its knowledge and
         belief (having made with respect to the UK Group only, due and
         careful enquiry) received any notice or communication which has not
         been disclosed to the Agent on or prior to the date hereof (or, where
         this representation and warranty is referred to as having been made
         in paragraph 2 of Section A (Representing Parties) of this Part C, to
         the Term Banks on or prior to the Term Execution Date) from, or is
         aware of, any inquiry, investigation or proceeding on the part of any
         government, court or regulatory agency or authority the effect of
         which, in any such case, could reasonably be expected to have a
         Material Adverse Effect.

(v)      Intellectual Property
         It is not aware of any adverse circumstance relating to the validity,
         subsistence or use of any of its and, in the case of the Pre-Novation
         Borrower and the CWC Parent, any member of the Target Group's and, in
         the case of the Parent, any member of the UK Group's Intellectual
         Property which could reasonably be expected to have a Material
         Adverse Effect.

(w)      Security Interest

         (i)      Subject (in each case) to the Reservations, each Security
                  Document and Second Security Document creates the security
                  interest which that Security Document or Second Security
                  Document purports to create or, if that Security Document or
                  Second Security Document purports to evidence a security
                  interest, accurately evidences a security interest which has
                  been validly created and each security interest ranks in
                  priority (save in respect of, if and to the extent
                  applicable, Permitted Encumbrances) as specified in the
                  Security Document creating or evidencing that interest.

         (ii)     Save as disclosed in the Disclosure Letter, the shares of
                  any UK Group or Target Group member which are subject to an
                  Encumbrance under the Security Documents and Second Security
                  Documents are fully paid and not subject to any option to
                  purchase or similar rights and the constitutional documents
                  of any such UK Group or Target Group member do not and could
                  not restrict or inhibit (whether absolutely, partly, under a
                  discretionary power or otherwise) any transfer of such
                  shares pursuant to enforcement of the Security Documents or
                  the Second Security Documents.

         (iii)    For the avoidance of doubt, the Security is intended to
                  secure all amounts outstanding under the Finance Documents
                  from time to time, including without

                                     213

                  on behalf of any party outside the Group (including, for the
