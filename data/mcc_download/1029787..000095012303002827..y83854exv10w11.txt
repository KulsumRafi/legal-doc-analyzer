Capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined herein are used as defined in
the Agreement (as defined below).

      WHEREAS, the parties hereto entered into that certain Subordinated Credit
Agreement, dated as of November 6, 2000 (as amended, supplemented, modified
and/or restated as of the date hereof and from time to time, the "AGREEMENT");

      SECTION 1. AMENDMENTS.

      (i) Section 1.1 of the Agreement hereby is amended by adding the following
definition thereto in proper alphabetical order to read in full as follows:

         "'Prime Rate' shall mean a fluctuating interest rate per annum equal at
         all times to the rate of interest announced publicly from time to time
         by Citibank, N.A. as its base rate; provided, that such rate is not
         necessarily the best rate offered to its customers, and, should Lender
         be unable to determine such rate, such other indication of the
         prevailing prime rate of interest as may reasonably be chosen by
         Lender; provided, that each change in fluctuating interest rate shall
         take effect simultaneously with the corresponding change in the Prime
         Rate."

      (ii) Section 2.5(a) of the Agreement hereby is amended and restated and
replaced in its entirety to read as follows:

         " (a) Interest on outstanding Advances shall be payable monthly in
         arrears on the first day of each calendar month at an annual rate of
         Prime Rate plus 3.0%, provided, however, that, notwithstanding, any
         other provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, the
         interest on outstanding Advances shall not be less than 12.75%."

      SECTION 2. AGREEMENT IN FULL FORCE AND EFFECT AS AMENDED. Except as
specifically amended hereby, the Agreement shall remain in full force and effect
and is hereby ratified and confirmed as so amended hereby. All references to the
Agreement shall be deemed to mean the Agreement as modified hereby. This
Agreement shall not constitute a novation of the Agreement, but shall constitute
an amendment thereof. The parties hereto agree to be bound by the terms and
conditions of the Agreement as amended by this Amendment, as though such terms
and conditions were set forth herein.

      SECTION 3. REPRESENTATIONS. The Borrower hereby represents and warrants as

existing and in good standing under the

      SECTION 4. MISCELLANEOUS.

      (a) The execution, delivery and effectiveness of this Amendment shall not,
except as expressly provided herein, operate as a waiver of any right, power or
remedy of Lender, nor constitute a waiver of any provision of the Agreement or
any other Loan Document, or any other documents, instruments and agreements
executed or delivered in connection therewith or of any Event of Default under
any of the foregoing whether arising before or after the date hereof or as a
result of performance hereunder.

      (b) This Amendment may be executed in any number of counterparts
(including by facsimile), and by the different parties hereto on the same or
separate counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original
instrument but all of which together shall constitute one and the same
agreement. The descriptive headings of the various sections of this Amendment

      (c) This Amendment may not be amended or otherwise modified except by
written agreement of Borrower and Lender. This Amendment shall be considered
part of the Agreement and shall be a Loan Document for all purposes under the
Agreement.

subsequent oral agreements between the parties, and shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the successors and assigns of the parties hereto and
thereto. There are no unwritten oral agreements between the parties with respect
to the subject matter hereof.

      (E) THIS AMENDMENT AND THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES UNDER
THIS AMENDMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED AND INTERPRETED IN ACCORDANCE
WITH THE CHOICE OF LAW PROVISIONS SET FORTH IN THE AGREEMENT AND SHALL BE
SUBJECT TO THE WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL AND NOTICE PROVISIONS OF THE AGREEMENT.
