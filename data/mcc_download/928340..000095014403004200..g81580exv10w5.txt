              deeds, undertakings, assurances and other things as he may require
              to satisfy himself throughout the term of the Licence that the
              effective control of the Company remains vested in and exercisable
              by the same directors and officers as those in whom it is vested
              and is exercisable immediately before the date of this Licence or
              such other directors and officers as the Governor may from time to
              time approve in his absolute discretion."

3.   After a period of eight calendar months of the date of this Amendment the
     following amendments shall become effective:

     (a)  The definition of "Water" in clause 2 of the Licence is deleted and
          the following substituted therefor:

          "Water"   means potable water processed by the Company from Seawater,
                    or purchased or otherwise acquired by the Company for the
                    purpose of distribution, in accordance with this Licence,
                    the quality of which shall be such that (a) the individual
                    constituents shall meet the values set out in Schedule 7,
                    and (b) the quality shall be as defined by regulations made
                    pursuant to the Public Health Law or, in the absence of such
                    regulations, by the most recent edition of the World Health
                    Organization Guidelines for Drinking Water Quality and its

                    the World Health Organization Guidelines for Drinking Water
                    Quality; and"

     (b)  Clause 5.5 of the Licence is deleted and the following substituted
          therefor:

          "5.5 OPERATION OF WORKS

          The Company shall operate the Works in a proper, workmanlike and
          efficient manner so as to ensure that at all times the risk of
          contamination of the Water is kept to a minimum and the continuity of
          the Water supply, at a normal and proper pressure, is maintained.
          Except to the extent (if any) allowed by Schedule 7, Water distributed
          under this Licence shall not be contaminated by

          (i)  any noxious chemical, or

          (ii)    any other substance, which in the opinion of the CEHO or the
                  Authority would be harmful to the public health, or

          (iii)   any chemical or substance that imparts odour, taste or colour,
                  which in the opinion of the CEHO or the Authority renders it
                  unacceptable to consumers.

          The Company shall ensure that all chemicals used in the Works and all
          additives in the Water shall be approved by the American Water Works
          Association or the National Sanitation Foundation for use with potable
          water. From time to time, but no less than once per year the Company
          shall submit a detailed list of all chemicals to be used in the Works,
          accompanied by relevant material safety data sheets (MSDS), to the
          CEHO and the Authority for review and approval. The Company shall only
          distribute Water in accordance with this Licence and its operation of
          the Works shall be subject to inspection by the CEHO and Authority and
          compliance with all lawful requirements of the CEHO and Authority."

     (c)  The following is added to the Licence as Clause 5.9:

          "5.9 TESTING OF WATER QUALITY

          The Company shall carry out testing of the water quality in accordance
          with Schedule 8. The Company shall submit the results of water quality
          tests to the CEHO and the Authority on a monthly basis, within
          fourteen days of the end of every calendar month. All tests for water
          quality shall be carried out in accordance with the current edition of
          Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater, jointly
          published by the American Public Health Association, the American

          Water Works Association and the Water Environment Federation or by the
          method prescribed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency
          or by any other method approved by the Authority. All tests for water
          quality that are not carried out on-site shall be carried out by a
          laboratory that has been approved by the Authority. From time to time
          the CEHO or the Authority may require the Licensee to carry out
          testing for specific constituents that are considered of significance
          to public health, but are not listed in Schedule 8."

     (d)  Clause 9.6 of the Licence is deleted and the following substituted
          therefor:

          "9.6 FAILURE TO OPERATE WORKS TO THE SATISFACTION OF THE CEHO AND
          AUTHORITY

          If at any time in the reasonable opinion of the CEHO and the Authority
          the Company:

          (a)  fails to operate the Works in compliance with Clause 5.5 or 5.9;
               or

          (b)  distributes water that does not comply with the definition of
               Water set out in Clause 2; or

          (c)  operates the Works in a manner that increases the risk to public
               health and is contrary to good practice according to the American
               Water Works Association;

          the CEHO or the Authority shall notify the Company in writing
          specifying the matter complained of and if the Company fails to take
          reasonable action to remedy any such failure within a reasonable time,
          then on the advice of the CEHO and the Authority the Governor may in
          his absolute discretion and after giving the Company the opportunity
          to present its case in a timely manner, terminate this Licence in
          accordance with clause 9.4."

     (e)  Schedule 4 of the Licence is deleted and the Schedule 4 hereto
          attached is substituted therefor:

     (f)  Schedules 7 and 8 hereto attached are added.

4.   As varied by this Amendment the Licence shall continue in full force and
     effect

                            ENERGY ADJUSTMENT FACTOR


In accordance with Clause 6.2 and for the purpose of dealing with fluctuations
in the cost of electricity consumed by the Company to process and provide Water,
the Company, within fourteen days of the end of every calendar month, shall
determine the Energy Adjustment Factor for that month in accordance with the
following formula and shall give notice thereof to the Authority:

                               EAF = SEC * (ET-EB)

WHERE:

     EAF =          The calculated Energy Adjustment Factor, which is the amount
                    expressed in six decimals of Cayman Islands dollars per
                    1,000 Gallons to be added to the Base Price of Water sold by
                    the Company, and invoiced by the Company to each customer
                    during the month under review;

     SEC =          Specific Energy Consumption, which is the greater of either
                    (i) the number of kWh used to produce and provide Water, as
                    defined in Section 44(a) of the Water Authority Regulations
                    (1999 Revision), as amended from time to time, or (ii)
                    ENCON, both numbers expressed as kWh/1,000 Gallons. In any
                    event the SEC shall not be larger than 18.93 kWh/1,000
                    Gallons;

     ENCON =        The weighted average of the specific energy consumption of
                    the Company's Seawater desalination plants and distribution
                    pumping facilities in Grand Cayman, expressed as the number
                    of kWh required to produce and provide 1,000 Gallons of
                    Water. The ENCON shall be calculated in January each year
                    from audited water production records and actual electricity
                    consumption during the previous calendar year;

     ET =           The weighted average cost of electricity inclusive of
                    Caribbean Utilities Company's fuel adjustment factor of the
                    Company's Seawater desalination plants and distribution
                    pumping facilities in Grand Cayman to produce and provide
                    Water during the month in review, expressed in six decimals
                    of Cayman Islands dollars per kWh;

     EB =           The base cost of electricity which is Cayman Islands dollar
                    0.105 per kWh.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                    6 of 10

An adjustment may be made to the EAF each month by adding or subtracting, as
appropriate, any amount that was over or under invoiced by the Company to its
customers, because of oversight or computational error of the EAF in the
previous twelve month period. The measurements and meter readings required for
the calculations that form part of this Schedule and for any adjustments may be
carried out by the staff of the Company, but shall be subject to verification by
the Authority, which may request any such additional information and invoices
that in its opinion is necessary to verify the accuracy of the same readings,
measurements and calculations.

The Company shall continue to use the above formula until such time as it is
revoked by a revised schedule to this franchise, and monthly invoices shall
reflect the volume supplied in the previous month.
