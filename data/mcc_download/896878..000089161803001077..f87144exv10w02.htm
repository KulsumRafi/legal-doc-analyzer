<P align="left"><FONT size="2">Dear Brad:
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On behalf of Intuit Inc. (<i>&#147;Intuit&#148;</i> or the <I>&#147;Company&#148;</I>), I am pleased to
offer you the position of Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer on the
terms set forth below.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Position. You will be employed by Intuit on January&nbsp;3, 2003 (the
<i>&#147;Commencement Date&#148;</i>). You will be appointed as its Senior Vice President,
Chief Financial Officer, effective January&nbsp;6, 2003 and continuing thereafter
until termination pursuant to Section&nbsp;7. You will report to the President and
Chief Executive Officer of Intuit. You will be expected to devote your full
working time and attention to the business of Intuit, and you will not render
services to any other business without the prior approval of the Board of
Directors or, directly or indirectly, engage or participate in any business
that is competitive in any manner with the business of Intuit. You will also
be expected to comply with and be bound by the Company&#146;s operating policies,
procedures and practices that are from time to time in effect during the term
of your employment.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Base Salary. Your initial base annual salary will be $475,000, payable
in accordance with Intuit&#146;s normal payroll practices with such payroll
deductions and withholdings as are required by law. Your base salary will be
reviewed on an annual basis and increased from time to time, but such
compensation shall not be reduced below $475,000 during your term of
employment.

annual base salary (the <i>&#147;Target Bonus&#148;</I>) in accordance with an Intuit incentive
compensation plan. Intuit will not prorate the Target Bonus payable to you for
this fiscal year ending July&nbsp;31, 2003. At the end of this fiscal year, if
still employed at such time, you will be paid a Target Bonus of at least
$285,000, less payroll deductions and withholdings as are required by law.

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;You will receive a signing bonus of $100,000 (the <i>&#147;Sign&#150;On Bonus&#148;</I>),
less such payroll deductions and withholdings as are required by law, within
thirty days following the Commencement Date. In the event you resign within

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stock Options. On the Commencement Date, the Compensation Committee
of the Board of Directors shall grant you a nonqualified stock option to
purchase 400,000 shares of Intuit common stock at an exercise price equal to
such common stock closing price on the Commencement Date (the &#147;<I>Option</I>&#148;). The
Option will be granted pursuant to and subject to the terms of the Intuit Inc.

and become exercisable on the first anniversary of the Commencement Date and

first anniversary of the Commencement Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing
vesting schedule for the Option, in the event of your Termination Following a
Change in Control, an Involuntary Termination or Termination without Cause and
in accordance with Sections&nbsp;9(b) and 9(c) below, you will have immediate
acceleration of the vesting and exercisability of the Option by that portion of

termination. The Option will have a maximum term of seven years from the date
of grant, but will terminate earlier in the event your employment terminates.

<P align="left"><FONT size="2"> unvested portion of the Option will terminate and you will have six months
following the date of your termination of employment in which to exercise the
then vested portion of your Option. At the end of the six months any vested
portion of the Option that you have not yet exercised will terminate. As

will be twelve months in the event your employment terminates due to your
disability and eighteen months if your employment terminates due to your death.
You should consult a tax advisor concerning your income tax consequences before
exercising any of the options. Intuit has registered the shares issuable under
options granted under the 2002 Plan on a Form&nbsp;S-8 registration statement and
shall keep such registration statement in effect for the entire period the
Option remains outstanding.

other definition of &#147;total disability&#148; as determined under Intuit&#146;s group life
insurance and accidental death and dismemberment plan or group long term
