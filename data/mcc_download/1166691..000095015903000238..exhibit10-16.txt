                                  AMENDMENT TO

                    COMCAST CORPORATION AND RALPH J. ROBERTS
                    ----------------------------------------


     This Amendment is made this ______ day of _____________ , 2002, by and

                                    RECITALS
                                    --------

     WHEREAS, Roberts and the Company entered into an amended and restated
Compensation and Deferred Compensation Agreement effective August 31, 1998 (the
"Agreement"); and

     WHEREAS, Roberts and the Company amended the Agreement by Amendment dated
as of August 19, 1999, and further amended the Agreement by Amendment dated as
of June 5, 2001 (the Agreement as thus amended by both Amendments being referred
to herein as the "Amended Agreement"); and


     WHEREAS, the Company desires to further modify the provisions of the
Amended Agreement concerning the payment of bonuses in connection with certain
split-dollar life insurance arrangements between Roberts and the Company; and


     WHEREAS, Roberts is agreeable to accepting the Company's proposed
modifications to the Amended Agreement;

     NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and of the provisions set
forth herein, the parties agree as follows:


<PAGE>

     1.Section 7.1 of the Amended Agreement is modified by replacing clause (a)
of the first sentence thereof with the following new clause (a): "(a) pay the
bonuses described in Section 7.2 hereof; and".


     2.Section 7.2.1 of the Amended Agreement is replaced with the following new
Section 7.2.1:

               7.2.1 at least thirty (30) days before the beginning of each
          policy year for an Insurance Policy during the joint lifetimes of
          Roberts and his spouse and during the lifetime of the survivor of
          them, the Company shall pay to Roberts if he is living, otherwise to
          his spouse if she is living, as a bonus (a "Premium Bonus"), an amount
          equal to the economic benefit of the insurance protection provided
          under the Policy and the applicable Split-Dollar Arrangement for that
          policy year on the life or lives of such as are then living of Roberts
          and his spouse, regardless of whether or not the issuer of the Policy
          requires that a premium be paid to such issuer for such policy year.
          The economic benefit referred to in the preceding sentence shall be
          the lesser of (i) the value of current life insurance protection as
          determined using the P.S. 58 rates set forth by the Internal Revenue
          Service in Revenue Ruling 55-747, 1955-2 C.B. 228, modified as
          appropriate to reflect that such insurance protection is on the joint
          lives of Roberts and his spouse and that the death benefit under the
          Policy is payable only upon the death of the second-to-die of them,
          and (ii) if such insurance protection is available from the issuer of
          the Policy as term insurance, the premium for such insurance
          protection as

                                      -2-
<PAGE>

          determined by reference to such issuer's current published premium
          rate for initial issue one-year term life insurance protection
          available to all standard risks; and"


     3.Section 7.2.2 of the Amended Agreement is modified by inserting the
words, "to Roberts if he is then living, to his spouse if he is not then living
but she is then living, or to the personal representatives of the second-to-die
of them if neither of them is then living," after the words "the Company shall
pay" and before the words "an additional" in the second line thereof.

     4.The parties hereby confirm that the terms "Split-Dollar Arrangement" and
"Split-Dollar Arrangements" as used in the Amended Agreement shall include all
those Split-Dollar Insurance Agreements which pertain to policies of insurance
which are owned by the following trusts: (a) the Trust of Ralph J. Roberts dated
November 30, 1976, (b) the Trust of Ralph J. Roberts and Suzanne F. Roberts
dated June 10, 1992, (c) the 1994-2 Trust of Ralph J. Roberts and Suzanne F.
Roberts dated July 22, 1994, (d) the Trust of Ralph J. Roberts dated December
19, 1995, and (e) the Trust of Ralph J. Roberts and Suzanne F. Roberts dated
January 13, 1998.

     5.Except as amended hereby, the Amended Agreement remains in full force and
effect.

     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Amendment the day
and year first above written.

                                    Comcast Corporation
