                         SEVERANCE AGREEMENT AND RELEASE
                         -------------------------------

                  THIS SEVERANCE AGREEMENT and RELEASE ("Agreement") is entered
into between Pratt Wallace ("the Executive') and Foamex International Inc.,
Foamex L.P., Foamex Carpet Cushion L.L.C. and all other affiliates and
subsidiaries of Foamex International Inc. (collectively "Foamex"). The Executive
and Foamex are entering into this Agreement because the Executive's employment
with Foamex is terminating and the parties (a) wish to define the terms of the
Executive's separation from employment, and (b) wish to amicably resolve any and
all claims and disputes which have been (or could have been) asserted by the
Executive against Foamex. The Executive and Foamex agree that termination of the
Executive's employment is for legitimate business reasons. This Agreement will
supercede any previous Agreements between the parties, except as otherwise set
forth in this Agreement.

Specific terms and conditions:

     1. Termination of Employment. The Executive's last day of work shall be
October 31, 2002, which shall be defined as the "Termination Date".

     2. Severance Payment Program. As part of the consideration for this
Agreement the Executive will receive a total of $815,000 (eight hundred fifteen
thousand dollars) (less applicable taxes and withholdings) to be paid as

         sum within seven days of the date this agreement is executed.
o        $300,000 (three hundred thousand dollars) to be paid in 26 equal
         payments of $11,538.47 (eleven thousand five hundred thirty eight
         dollars and 47 cents) in accordance with the normal Foamex salaried
         payroll calendar beginning the Termination Date.
o        $300,000 (three hundred thousand dollars) to be paid in 52 equal
         payments of $5,769.23 (five thousand seven hundred sixty nine dollars

         payroll calendar beginning one year from the Termination Date.
o        $100,000 (one hundred thousand dollars) to be paid in 26 equal payments

         beginning three years from the Termination Date.

     3. Supplemental Benefits. For a forty-eight (48) month period beginning on
the Termination Date, the Executive also will receive continued medical and
dental coverage consistent with that which will be available to Foamex employees
over the next 48 months. The Executive will be required to make the normal
employee contribution to medical benefits on a monthly basis during this
48-month period and will be responsible for all co-payments that will be
associated with the medical and dental coverage provided to Foamex employees.
All other benefits will terminate on the Termination Date.

     4. Stock Options. As additional consideration for this Agreement the

outplacement services with Right Management Consultants in their
Professional/Management services plan for a period of six months beginning from

     6. Non-Competition. For a period of 48 months beginning on the Termination
Date the Executive shall not for any reason, either directly or indirectly,
participate, engage, or have a financial interest in a "National Competing Foam
Business". For purposes of this Agreement, a "National Competing Foam Business"
is defined as any individual, corporation, partnership entity, and/or other form
of business, which manufactures or distributes products identical or similar to
those manufactured, sold and/or otherwise distributed by Foamex during the
Executive's tenure with Foamex and which has more than one foam manufacturing
facility (not including regional foam fabrication facilities associated with the
manufacturer) such as, but not limited to Carpenter, Hickory Springs, Flexible,
Leggett & Platt and Vita Foam. In the event the Executive is employed by or has
a financial interest in a customer of Foamex the Executive agrees not to cause a
diminution of the Foamex supply position with that customer. The Executive
agrees that the time period and geographic scope of this Non-Competition
obligation are reasonable and proper.

     7. No Solicitation. For a period of 48 months beginning on the Termination
Date, the Executive agrees that he will not directly or indirectly solicit or
encourage Foamex employees to terminate their employment with Foamex, and/or to
become employed by or work with the Executive or any third party. Except as
permitted in section 5, during this period, the Executive also agrees that he
will not interfere in any way with Foamex's business relationships with its
customers, suppliers, vendors, representatives, agents and/or employees.

     8. Confidential Corporate Information. The Executive will maintain the
confidentiality of Foamex's Confidential Corporate Information and will not
disclose Confidential Corporate Information to anyone at any time. "Confidential
Corporate Information" as used in this Agreement means: (i) confidential,
proprietary, commercially-sensitive, or otherwise secret information, knowledge,
data analyses, or reports concerning the Company's businesses, legal affairs,
products, services, methods, customers, customer-related information, budgets,
finance, financial reports and financial projections, data and programs,
computer software and management information systems, marketing strategies and
forecasts, personnel, prices, costs, business plans, purchasing, research and
development, data processing, engineering, inventions, improvements,
discoveries, innovations, and ideas, whether potentially subject to a patent or
not; (ii) nonpublic information about mergers, acquisitions, securities
offerings, or other transactions involving Foamex; (iii) information bearing the
legend or conspicuously marked as "Confidential" or "Proprietary," or language
of like import; and (iv) all other information that a reasonable employee would
regard as confidential, proprietary, commercially-sensitive or secret.
Confidential Corporate Information also includes such information for
subsidiaries or other affiliates of Foamex. Confidential Corporate Information
may be in a tangible or intangible form, and communicated visually, orally, in
writing, or

<PAGE>

electronically. Confidential Corporate Information does not include information
that is, or becomes, available to the public generally.

     9. Acknowledgment of Non-Competition and No Solicitation and
Confidentiality Provisions. The Executive expressly acknowledges and agrees that
he (a) understands the scope and meaning of the restrictions set forth in
sections 6, 7, and 8 of this Agreement, (b) agrees that they are necessary and
reasonable to protect Foamex's legitimate interests, (c) agrees that he has been
well compensated though this Agreement for agreeing to these restrictions, and
(d) agrees that these restrictions will not prevent him from engaging in gainful
and meaningful employment. Failure to comply with any term set forth in section
6, 7, or 8 of this Agreement will result in the Executive's forfeiture of the
severance payment program set forth in paragraph 1 above. Failure to comply with
any term set forth in sections 6, 7, or 8 of this Agreement would be a material
breach of this Agreement and would create irreparable harm for Foamex.
Consequently, the Executive agrees that Foamex shall have (in addition to any
claim for damages) the right to equitable relief, including but not limited to,
specific performance and injunctive relief for violations of sections 6, 7,
and/or 8 of this Agreement, The Executive further agrees that the existence of
any claim or cause of action he may have against Foamex, other than Foamex's
obligation for compensation as described in Section 2, 3 & 4 of this agreement,
shall not constitute a defense to the enforcement by Foamex of any of the terms
of this Agreement.

     10. General Release. In consideration for the severance payments and
benefits as set forth above, and other good and valuable consideration set forth
herein, the Executive hereby releases Foamex, its shareholders, directors,
officers, employees, agents, attorneys, affiliates, parents, subsidiaries,
predecessors, successors, assigns, and all persons acting by, through, under or
in concert with any of them, from any and all charges, complaints, claims,
liabilities, obligations, promises, agreements, controversies, damages, actions,
causes of action, suits, rights, demands, costs, losses, debts and expenses, and
from any claims of any nature whatsoever, known or unknown, which the Executive
now has, claims to have, own, hold or which the Executive at any time heretofore
had, held, or claims to have, including without limitation, Civil Action #
