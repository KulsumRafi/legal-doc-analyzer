         WHEREAS, there has previously been executed and delivered to the
Trustee an Indenture dated as of April 21, 1998 (the "Indenture"), providing for
the issuance of Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Debentures due 2018 (the
"Debentures") of Atmel Corporation, a California corporation ("Atmel
California"); and

         WHEREAS, Atmel California has merged (or will merge substantially
concurrently with the execution and delivery of this First Supplemental
Indenture) with and into Atmel Delaware (the "Merger"), with Atmel Delaware as
the surviving corporation in the Merger pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of
Merger, dated as of September 17, 1999, between Atmel California and Atmel
Delaware; and

         WHEREAS, pursuant to the Merger each outstanding share of common stock
of Atmel California is converted into one outstanding share of common stock of
Atmel Delaware; and

         WHEREAS, in the case of a merger of Atmel California with and into any
other corporation, Article 5 and Section 11.14 of the Indenture require that the

obligations of the Company under the Indenture; and

         WHEREAS, Section 9.01 of the Indenture provides that the Company (as
defined in the Indenture) and the Trustee may, without the consent of any
Debentureholders, enter into a supplemental indenture to comply with the terms
of Article 5 and Section 11.14 of the Indenture; and

         WHEREAS, in accordance with Sections 9.01(2), 5.01 and 12.05 of the
Indenture, the Company (as defined in the Indenture) has delivered to the
Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that
the Merger and the First Supplemental Indenture comply with the applicable
provisions of the Indenture; and

         WHEREAS, all acts and proceedings required by law, under the Indenture

First Supplemental Indenture a valid and binding agreement for the uses and
purposes set forth herein, in accordance with its terms, have been done and
taken, and the execution and delivery of this First Supplemental Indenture have
been in all respects duly authorized by Atmel Delaware; and

and valuable consideration, the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, Atmel
Delaware and the Trustee hereby agree as follows:

         1. For purposes of this First Supplemental Indenture, except as
otherwise herein expressly provided or unless the context otherwise requires:

meanings as corresponding terms and expressions used in the Indenture; and (ii)
the words "herein," "hereof" and "hereby" and other words of similar import used
in this First Supplemental Indenture refer to this First Supplemental Indenture
as a whole and not to any particular section hereof.

         2. Atmel Delaware hereby assumes all the covenants, agreements and
obligations of the Company under the Debentures and the Indenture, including the
obligation to make due and punctual payment of the principal of and premium, if
any, and original issue discount and interest, if any, on all of the Debentures
and the due and punctual performance of all of the covenants and conditions to
be performed by the Company under the Indenture. From and after the effective
time of the Merger, the Debentures shall be convertible into shares of common
stock of Atmel Delaware on the same terms and basis (and subject to the same
adjustments under the Indenture) as the Debentures were convertible into common
stock of Atmel California prior to the effectiveness of the Merger, and on and
after the effective time of the Merger references in the Indenture to "Common
Stock" shall be deemed to be references to common stock of Atmel Delaware.

representations as to the validity or sufficiency of this First Supplemental
Indenture and shall incur no liability or responsibility in respect of the
