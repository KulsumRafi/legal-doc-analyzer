any applicable federal or state securities or other law or valid regulation.  As
a condition to the Optionee's  exercise of this Option,  the Company may require
the person exercising this Option to make any representation and warranty to the
Company as may be required by any applicable law or regulation.

equivalent  rights.  Such rights  shall  provide that upon the payment of a cash
dividend on the Common Stock,  the holder of such Options shall receive  payment
of cash in an amount  equivalent to the cash dividend payable as if such Options
had been  exercised  and such Common Stock held as of the dividend  record date.
Such rights  shall  expire upon the  expiration  or exercise of such  underlying
Options.   Such  rights  are   non-transferable  and  shall  attach  to  Options
represented  by this  Agreement  whether  or not such  Options  are  immediately
