                    -------------------------
                    agreement,  the Providing Party's employees may perform some
                    or all of the following administrative services on behalf of

                    viii.   Other necessary administrative services.

     2.     Management of Employees.  The Providing  Party's  employees shall at
            ------------------------
            all times  operate  under the  management  control of the  executive
            officers of Providing Party. The executive officers of the Providing
            Party shall maintain the right to hire  additional  employees and to
            otherwise commence any and all necessary and appropriate  management
            action with respect to the Providing  Party's  employees  performing
            services on behalf of the Receiving Party.

     3.     Costs Not Subject to  Allocation.  The Parties may determine that an
            ---------------------------------
            expense item or group of expenses  segregated  into Receiving  Party
            disbursement codes are one hundred percent (100%) chargeable to that
            specific Receiving Party and are therefore not subject to allocation
            or cost sharing.

     4.     Allocation of Costs and Allocation  Methods.  Costs  associated with
            --------------------------------------------
            the services  provided by the Providing  Party shall be allocated to
            the  Receiving  Party based on standard  allocation  techniques  and
            procedures  acceptable under general cost accounting  techniques and
            procedures   that  shall  be  in  conformity   with  NAIC  statutory
            accounting  principles.  Expenses shall be apportioned in accordance
            with Statement of Statutory Accounting Procedure No. 70, "Allocation
            of Expenses." The books, accounts and records shall be so maintained
            as to clearly and accurately  disclose the nature and details of the
            transactions  including such accounting  information as is necessary
            to support the expenses  apportioned to the respective parties.  The
            following  methods  or some  combination  thereof,  shall be used as
            appropriate to allocate expenses to the Receiving Party:

            a.      Special Cost Studies;

            b.      Individual Time Estimates;

            c.      Claims Counts;

            d.      Policies in Force;

            e.      Direct Written Premiums;

            f.      Pro rata share of the Receiving Party's employees,  or their
                    salaries; and/or;

            g.      Any  other  method  agreed  to by the  Parties  that  are in
                    conformity with NAIC statutory accounting principles.

     5.     Maintenance and Payment of Expenses.
            ------------------------------------

<PAGE>

            a.      The Parties shall  maintain  expenses for such operation and
                    administrative  services  in  sufficient  detail  so  as  to
                    facilitate   proper   allocation  to  the  Receiving  Party,
                    including the cost allocation methodology.

            b.      The Receiving  Party shall remit payment for the operational
                    and   administrative   expenses  to  the  Providing   Party.
                    Estimated  settlements  shall be executed as  appropriate to
                    maintain  equity of cash flow in  accordance  with  treasury
                    policy and cash management principles. In most instances the
                    actual  settlement will occur quarterly  taking into account
                    the  estimated  settlements.  The  payment  of  invoices  is
                    expected  within a reasonable  and timely  manner  (i.e.  90
                    days)  following  receipt of the  invoice  by the  Receiving
                    Party.

     6.     Chief Financial Officer.
            ------------------------

            a.      The Chief Financial  Officer of Nationwide  Mutual Insurance
                    Company   (the   "CFO")   or  the  CFO's   duly   authorized
                    representative (the  "Representative")  shall be responsible
                    for allocation of expenses to the Receiving Parties. The CFO
                    or the  Representative  may seek input from other areas, but
                    shall make the ultimate decision regarding the allocation of
                    expenses.

            b.      It   shall  be  the   responsibility   of  the  CFO  or  the
                    Representative  to maintain  fairness  and equity of expense
                    allocations  and to  ensure  that  such  allocations  are in
                    conformity  with customary  insurance  accounting  practices
                    consistently applied and in accordance with NAIC guidelines.

     7.     Disputes  Regarding  Allocation.  If a dispute  arises  between  the
            --------------------------------
            Parties  regarding the allocation of expenses and cannot be resolved
            between the Parties and the CFO or the Representative, the executive
            officers of the Parties may, at their option, negotiate a settlement
            related thereto.  The CFO or the Representative shall be responsible
            for the operational aspects of any such settlement.

     8.     Future Corporate Structure Changes.  Unless otherwise agreed to, the
            -----------------------------------
            Parties  shall cause any  corporation  that in the future  becomes a
            subsidiary  or  affiliate  having  the  ultimate  parent  entity  of
            Nationwide  Mutual Insurance  Company and/or  Nationwide Mutual Fire
            Insurance Company, to become a party hereto as an additional "Party"
            hereto.  Conversely, the parties shall cause any corporation that in
            the future  ceases to be a subsidiary  or  affiliate  not having the
            ultimate parent entity of Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company and/or
            Nationwide  Mutual Fire Insurance  Company,  to no longer be a party
            hereto.

            in writing, executed by all Parties, and approved by the appropriate
            regulatory authorities. Notwithstanding the foregoing, and except as
            otherwise agreed to by the Parties, an amendment,

<PAGE>

            modification  or  supplement  to  this  Agreement  with  respect  to
            particular  Parties  affected  by such  amendment,  modification  or
            supplement  is effective as it relates to such  particular  Parties;
            provided,  however,  that  any  such  amendment,   modification,  or
            supplement  is in  writing  and  executed  by the  Parties,  and the
            Agreement  shall remain in full force and effect with respect to the
            remaining Parties to the Agreement.

     11.    Entire Agreement.  This Agreement and any and all addenda, schedules
