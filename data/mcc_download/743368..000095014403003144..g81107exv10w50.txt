                  THIS RECEIVABLES SALE AGREEMENT, dated as of December 19,
2002, is by and among Bowater Incorporated, a Delaware corporation (together
with its successors, "BOWATER" or a "SELLER"), Lake Superior Holdings Inc., a
Delaware corporation (together with its successors, "LAKE SUPERIOR" or a
"SELLER"), and Bowater America Inc., a Delaware corporation (together with its
successors, "BAI" or a "SELLER"), and Bowater Funding Inc., a Delaware
corporation (together with its successors, "BUYER"). UNLESS DEFINED ELSEWHERE
HEREIN, CAPITALIZED TERMS USED IN THIS AGREEMENT SHALL HAVE THE MEANINGS
ASSIGNED TO SUCH TERMS IN EXHIBIT I HERETO (OR, IF NOT DEFINED IN EXHIBIT I
HERETO, THE MEANING ASSIGNED TO SUCH TERM IN THE LOAN AGREEMENT).

                             PRELIMINARY STATEMENTS

                  Bowater now owns, and from time to time hereafter will own,
         Receivables. Bowater wishes to sell to BAI and contribute to Lake
         Superior, Lake Superior wishes to contribute to BAI, and BAI wishes to
         sell and contribute to Buyer (each of Buyer, BAI and Lake Superior
         being sometimes hereinafter referred to as a "TRANSFEREE" with respect
         any such sale or contribution), all of their respective right, title
         and interest in and to all Receivables originated by Bowater from and
         after the Initial Cutoff Date through and including the Termination
         Date, together with the Related Security and Collections with respect
         thereto.

                  In addition, BAI now owns, and from time to time hereafter
         will own, Receivables. BAI wishes to sell and contribute to Buyer, all
         of its right, title and interest in and to all Receivables originated
         by BAI from and after the Initial Cutoff Date through and including the
         Termination Date, together with the Related Security and Collections
         with respect thereto.

                  Each of the parties hereto intends the transactions
         contemplated hereby to be true sales or true contributions by the
         applicable Seller to the applicable Transferee of the Receivables
         originated or acquired (in each case, as applicable) by it, providing
         the applicable Transferee with the full benefits of ownership of such
         Receivables, and none of the parties intends these transactions to be,
         or for any purpose to be characterized as, loans from any of the
         Transferees to any of the Sellers.

                  Buyer plans to finance its purchases of Receivables hereunder
         by borrowing under that certain Loan Agreement dated as of December 19,
         2002 (as the same may from time to time hereafter be amended,

         Corporation, SunTrust Bank and Wachovia Bank, National Association
         (together with their respective successors and assigns, the "LENDERS"),
         (d) SunTrust Capital Markets, Inc. and Wachovia Bank, National

                  NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the

                                   ARTICLE I
                AMOUNTS AND TERMS OF CONTRIBUTIONS AND PURCHASES

                  Section 1.1 Contribution of Certain Receivables.

         Receivables originated by BAI that cannot be purchased with cash or the
         proceeds of a Subordinated Loan in accordance with the limitation
         specified in Section 1.2(c) (such Receivables, the "INITIAL CONTRIBUTED

         contribution and after giving effect thereto, such Transferee shall own

                           (i) in consideration for the Purchase Price paid to

         relating thereto and all Collections thereof; and

         originated by BAI (other than the Initial Contributed Receivables), and
         existing as of the close of business on the Initial Cutoff Date, in
         each case, together with all Related Security relating thereto and all
         Collections thereof.

                  (b) On each Purchase Date after the Closing Date:

                           (i) in consideration for the Purchase Price paid to
         Bowater and upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
         herein: (A) Bowater does hereby sell, assign, transfer, set-over and
         otherwise convey to BAI, without recourse (except to the extent
         expressly provided herein), and (B) BAI shall purchase from Bowater,
         all of Bowater's right, title and interest in and to all Receivables
         originated by Bowater and existing as of the close of business on the
         Business Day immediately prior to such Purchase Date (other than any
         Contributed Receivables and Receivables previously sold pursuant to
         this Agreement), in each case, together with all Related Security
         relating thereto and all Collections thereof; and

                           (ii) in consideration for the Purchase Price paid to
         BAI and upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein:
         (A) BAI does hereby sell, assign, transfer, set-over and otherwise
         convey to Buyer, without recourse (except to the extent expressly

         this Agreement) and existing as of the close of business on the
         Business Day immediately prior to such Purchase Date, in each case,
         together with all Related Security relating thereto and all Collections
         thereof.

                  (c) Each Transferee shall be obligated to pay the applicable
         Seller the Purchase Price for the Receivables purchased by it hereunder
         (i) in immediately available funds, and/or (ii) by delivery to such
         Seller of the proceeds of a loan from such Seller to such Transferee
         (each, a "PURCHASE PRICE LOAN") in an amount not to exceed the least of
         (A) the remaining unpaid portion of such Purchase Price, (B) the
         maximum Purchase Price Loan that could be borrowed without rendering
         the Net Worth less than the Required Capital Amount, and (C) fifteen
         percent (15%) of such Purchase Price, and/or (iii) unless the
         Termination Date has occurred, by accepting a contribution to its
         capital in an amount equal to the remaining unpaid balance of such
         Purchase Price. Each Purchase Price Loan made by Bowater to BAI shall
         be a senior loan, and all such senior Purchase Price Loans shall be
         evidenced by a grid promissory note in the form of Exhibit V-1 hereto
         (the "PURCHASE PRICE LOAN NOTE"). Each Purchase Price Loan made by BAI
         to the Buyer shall be a subordinated loan (each, a "SUBORDINATED
         LOAN"), and all such Subordinated Loans shall be evidenced by a single
         grid promissory note in the form of Exhibit V-2 hereto (the
         "SUBORDINATED NOTE"). Bowater is hereby authorized by BAI to endorse on
         the schedule attached to the Purchase Price Loan Note an appropriate
         notation evidencing the date and amount of each advance thereunder, as
         well as the date of each payment with respect thereto, PROVIDED THAT
         the failure to make such notation shall not affect any obligation of
         BAI thereunder. BAI is hereby authorized by Buyer to endorse on the
         schedule attached to the Subordinated Note an appropriate notation
         evidencing the



                                       -3-
<PAGE>

         date and amount of each advance thereunder, as well as the date of each
         payment with respect thereto, PROVIDED THAT the failure to make such
         notation shall not affect any obligation of Buyer thereunder. On each
         Reporting Date, each Seller shall (or shall require Servicer to)
         deliver to the applicable Transferee (with a copy to the Administrative
         Agent, as Buyer's pledgee, if requested by the Administrative Agent) a
         report in substantially the form of Exhibit VI hereto (each such report
         being herein called a "PURCHASE REPORT") with respect to the
         Receivables sold or contributed by such Seller during the Calculation
         Period then most recently ended. In addition to, and not in limitation
         of, the foregoing, in connection with the payment of the Purchase Price
         for any Receivables purchased hereunder, each applicable Transferee may
         request that the applicable Seller deliver, and such Seller shall
         deliver, such information or documents as such Transferee may
         reasonably request.

                  (d) It is the intention of the parties hereto that each sale
         or contribution of Receivables to a Transferee pursuant to this
         Agreement shall constitute a true sale or contribution or other
         absolute transfer and assignment, which sale, contribution, transfer or
         assignment is absolute and irrevocable and provides the applicable
         Transferee with the full benefits of ownership of the Receivables.
         Except for the Purchase Price Credits owed to the applicable Seller
         pursuant to Section 1.4, each sale of Receivables hereunder by a Seller
         is made without recourse to such Seller; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that (i)
         such Seller shall be liable to the applicable Transferee and each of
         its assigns for all representations, warranties, covenants and
         indemnities made by such Seller pursuant to the terms of the
         Transaction Documents to which such Seller is a party, and (ii) no such
         sale constitutes, or is intended to result in, an assumption by any
         Transferee or any assignee thereof of any obligation of such Seller or
         any other Person arising in connection with the Receivables, the
         related Contracts and/or other Related Security or any other
         obligations of such Seller. In view of the intention of the parties
         hereto that each sale or contribution of Receivables made hereunder
         shall constitute a true sale or contribution of such Receivables rather
         than a loan secured thereby, each Seller agrees that it will, on or
         prior to the Closing Date and in accordance with Section 4.1(e)(ii),
         mark its master data processing records relating to the Receivables
         with a legend stating that "The accounts receivable of Bowater
         Incorporated and Bowater America Inc. reflected herein have been sold
         or contributed, directly or indirectly, to Bowater Funding Inc.
         (`SPC'), and a security interest in such receivables has been granted
         by SPC to SunTrust Capital Markets, Inc., as administrative agent for
         various parties" and to note in its financial statements that its
         Receivables have been sold or contributed to the applicable Transferee.
         Upon the request of any Transferee or the Administrative Agent, each
         Seller will prepare and file such financing or continuation statements,
         or amendments thereto or assignments thereof, and such other
         instruments or notices, as may be necessary or appropriate to perfect
         and maintain the perfection of its applicable Transferee's (and
         ultimately, Buyer's) ownership interest in the Receivables and the
         Related Security that is subject to Article 9 of the UCC and
         Collections with respect thereto, or as any Transferee or the
         Administrative Agent may reasonably request.

         Closing Date shall be payable in full by the applicable Transferee to
         the applicable Seller on the Closing Date, and shall be paid to such
         Seller in the manner described in Section 1.2(c). The Purchase Price
         for each Receivable coming into existence after the Initial Cutoff Date
         shall be due and owing in full (but not necessarily payable) by the
         applicable Transferee to the applicable Seller or its designee on the
         Purchase Date immediately following the Business Day on which such
         Receivable comes into existence (except that each Transferee may, with
         respect to any such Purchase Price, offset against such Purchase Price
         any amounts owed by such Seller to such Transferee hereunder and which
         have become due but remain unpaid) and shall be paid to such Seller in
         the manner provided in the following paragraphs (b), (c) and (d).

                  (b) With respect to each Receivable (other than a Contributed
         Receivable) coming into existence after the Initial Cutoff Date, on
         each Settlement Date, each applicable Transferee shall pay the
         applicable Seller the Purchase Price therefore, in accordance with
         Section 1.3(d), by delivery to such Seller of (i) immediately available
         funds, and/or (ii) the proceeds of a Purchase Price Loan of the type
         and subject to the limitations on amount set forth in Section 1.2(c),
         and/or (iii) unless the Termination Date has occurred, by accepting a
         contribution to its capital in an amount equal to the remaining unpaid
         balance of such Purchase Price. Each Purchase Price Loan shall be
         evidenced by the Purchase Price Loan Note. Each Subordinated Loan shall
         be evidenced by the Subordinated Note. Bowater is hereby authorized by
         BAI to endorse on the schedule attached to the Purchase Price Loan Note
         an appropriate notation evidencing the date and amount of each advance
         thereunder, as well as the date of each payment with respect thereto,
         PROVIDED THAT the failure to make such notation shall not affect any
         obligation of BAI thereunder. BAI is hereby authorized by Buyer to
         endorse on the schedule attached to the Subordinated Note an
         appropriate notation evidencing the date and amount of each advance
         thereunder, as well as the date of each payment with respect thereto,
         PROVIDED THAT the failure to make such notation shall not affect any
         obligation of Buyer thereunder.

                  (c) From and after the Termination Date, no Seller shall be
         obligated to (but may, at its option) sell or contribute Receivables to
         any Transferee.

                  (d) Although the Purchase Price for each Receivable coming
         into existence after the Initial Cutoff Date shall be due and owing in
         full by the applicable Transferee to the applicable Seller on the
         Purchase Date immediately following the Business Day on which such
         Receivable comes into existence, settlement of the Purchase Price
         between each Transferee and its applicable Seller shall be effected on
         a monthly basis on Settlement Dates with respect to all Receivables
         originated during the same Calculation Period and based on the
         information contained in the applicable Purchase Report delivered by or
         on behalf of such Seller for the Calculation Period then most recently
         ended. Although settlement shall be effected on Settlement Dates, any
         contribution of capital by a Seller to its Transferee made pursuant to
         Section 1.3(b) shall be deemed to



                                       -5-
<PAGE>

         have occurred and shall be effective as of the last Business Day of the
         Calculation Period to which such settlement relates.

                  Section 1.4 Purchase Price Credit Adjustments. If on any day:

                  (a) the Outstanding Balance of any Receivable purchased from a
         Seller is:

                           (i) reduced as a result of any defective, rejected or
         returned goods or services, any discount or adjustment or otherwise by
         such Seller (other than a reduction in such Outstanding Balance
         resulting from (A) cash Collections received by the applicable
         Transferee or by its assigns or Servicer, on such Transferee's behalf,
         on account of such Receivable's Outstanding Balance, or (B) any reserve
         established against or write-off of such Receivable that is made due to
         its becoming a Defaulted Receivable or otherwise based on the
         uncollectibility of such Receivable on account of the insolvency,
         bankruptcy, lack of creditworthiness or financial inability to pay of
         the applicable Obligor), or

                           (ii) reduced (in whole or in part) as a result of a
         setoff in respect of any claim by any Person (whether such claim arises
         out of the same or a related transaction or an unrelated transaction),
         or

                  (b) any of such Seller's representations and warranties set
         forth in Sections 2.1(i), (j), (r), (s), (t), the second sentence of
         Section 2.1(q) hereof and the last sentence of Section 2.1(c) are not
         true when made or deemed made with respect to any Receivable,

then, in such event, the applicable Transferee shall be entitled to a credit
(each, a "PURCHASE PRICE CREDIT") against the Purchase Price otherwise payable
to such Seller hereunder equal to (x) in the case of a reduction under the
preceding clause (a)(i) or (ii), the amount of such whole or partial reduction,
and (y) in the case of a misrepresentation described in the preceding clause
(b), the full Outstanding Balance of such Receivable. In any event described in
clause (a)(i) or (a)(ii), the applicable Transferee shall deem this Receivable
collected. If such Purchase Price Credit owing to a Transferee by its applicable
Seller exceeds the aggregate Original Balance of the Receivables originated on
any day by such Seller, such Seller shall pay the remaining amount of such
Purchase Price Credit in cash (i) if the Termination Date has not occurred, not
later than the next Settlement Date, and (ii) if the Termination Date has
occurred, immediately.

                  Section 1.5 Payments and Computations, Etc. All amounts to be
paid or deposited by a Transferee hereunder shall be paid or deposited in
accordance with the terms hereof on the day when due in immediately available
funds to the account of the applicable Seller designated from time to time by
such Seller or as otherwise directed by such Seller. In the event that any
payment owed by any Person hereunder becomes due on a day that is not a Business
Day, then such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day. If any
Person fails to pay any amount hereunder when due, such Person agrees to pay, on
demand, the Default Fee in respect thereof until paid in full; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that such Default Fee shall not at any time exceed the maximum rate
permitted by applicable law. All computations of



                                       -6-
<PAGE>

interest payable hereunder shall be made on the basis of a year of 360 days for
the actual number of days (including the first but excluding the last day)
elapsed.

                  Section 1.6 License of Software.

                  (a) To the extent that any software used by a Seller to
         account for the Receivables transferred by it is non-transferable, each
         Seller hereby grants to its Transferee, such Transferee's assigns, the
         Administrative Agent and Servicer an irrevocable, non-exclusive license
         to use, without royalty or payment of any kind, all such software used
         by such Seller to account for such Receivables, to the extent necessary
         to administer such Receivables, whether such software is owned by such
         Seller or is owned by others and used by such Seller under license
         agreements with respect thereto, PROVIDED THAT should the consent of
         any licensor of such software be required for the grant of the license
         described herein, to be effective, such Seller hereby agrees that upon
         the request of its Transferee (or its assigns), such Seller will use
         its reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of such third-party
         licensor. The license granted hereby shall be irrevocable until the
         later to occur of (i) indefeasible payment in full of the Obligations
         (as defined in the Loan Agreement), and (ii) the date on which each of
         this Agreement and the Loan Agreement terminates in accordance with its
         terms.

                  (b) Upon the request to any Seller by its Transferee and/or
         the Administrative Agent (as the ultimate assignee), such Seller (i)
         shall take such action that may be necessary or appropriate to ensure
         that Buyer has an enforceable ownership interest in the records
         included in the Receivable Files relating to the Receivables, and (ii)
         shall use its reasonable efforts to ensure that each of the Buyer, the
         Administrative Agent and the Servicer has an enforceable right (whether
         by license or sublicense or otherwise) to use all of the computer
         software used to account for such Receivables and/or to recreate such
         records.

                  Section 1.7 Characterization. If, notwithstanding the
intention of the parties expressed in Section 1.2(d), any sale or contribution
by a Seller of Receivables hereunder shall be characterized as a secured loan
and not a sale or such sale shall for any reason be ineffective or
unenforceable, then this Agreement shall be deemed to constitute a security
agreement under the UCC and other applicable law. For this purpose and without
being in derogation of the parties' intention that each transfer of Receivables
by a Seller hereunder shall constitute a true sale thereof: each Seller hereby
grants to its applicable Transferee and its assigns a valid and continuing
security interest in all of such Seller's right, title and interest in, to and
under all Receivables originated or acquired by such Seller which are now
existing or hereafter arising and are intended to be sold or contributed to such
Transferee in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, all Collections and
Related Security with respect thereto, all other rights and payments relating to
such Receivables and all proceeds of the foregoing to secure the prompt and
complete payment of a loan deemed to have been made in an amount equal to the
Purchase Price of the Receivables purchased from such Seller together with all
other obligations of such Seller hereunder, which security interest shall be
prior to all other Adverse Claims thereto. Furthermore, to the extent that any
Seller has been granted a security interest pursuant to this Section 1.7, such
Seller hereby grants a valid and continuing security interest in such security



                                       -7-
<PAGE>

interest to its applicable Transferee and such Transferee's assigns. The
applicable Transferee and its assigns shall have, in addition to the rights and
remedies which they may have under this Agreement, all other rights and remedies
provided to a secured creditor under the UCC and other applicable law, which
rights and remedies shall be cumulative.

                                   ARTICLE II
                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

                  Section 2.1 Representations and Warranties of Each Seller.
Each Seller hereby represents and warrants to its applicable Transferee and its
assigns on the Closing Date and on each Purchase Date thereafter as to such
Seller and the Receivables transferred by it that:

                  (a) Existence and Power. Such Seller is duly organized under
the laws of its jurisdiction of organization specified in Exhibit II hereto.
Such Seller is validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its
jurisdiction of organization and is duly qualified to do business and is in good
standing as a foreign corporation and has and holds all corporate or company
power and all governmental licenses, authorizations, consents and approvals
required to carry on its business in each jurisdiction in which its business is
conducted except where the failure to so qualify or so hold could not reasonably
be expected to have a Seller Material Adverse Effect.

                  (b) Power and Authority; Due Authorization, Execution and
Delivery. The execution and delivery by such Seller of this Agreement and each
other Transaction Document to which it is a party, and the performance of its
obligations hereunder and thereunder, and such Seller's use of the proceeds of
each Purchase made from it hereunder, are within its corporate powers and
authority and have been duly authorized by all necessary action on its part.
This Agreement and each other Transaction Document to which such Seller is a
party has been duly executed and delivered by such Seller.

                  (c) No Conflict. The execution and delivery by such Seller of
this Agreement and each other Transaction Document to which it is a party, and
the performance of its obligations hereunder and thereunder do not contravene or
violate (i) its Organizational Documents, (ii) any law, rule or regulation
applicable to it, (iii) any restrictions under any agreement, contract or
instrument to which it is a party or by which it or any of its property is
bound, or (iv) any order, writ, judgment, award, injunction or decree binding on
or affecting it or its property, and do not result in the creation or imposition
of any Adverse Claim on assets of such Seller or its Subsidiaries (except as
created hereunder) except, in any case set forth in clause (ii)-(iv) above,
where such contravention or violation could not reasonably be expected to have a
Seller Material Adverse Effect. No transaction contemplated hereby requires
compliance with any bulk sales act or similar law.

                  (d) Governmental Authorization. Other than the filing of the
financing statements required hereunder, no authorization or approval or other
action by, and no notice to or filing with, any governmental authority or
regulatory body is required for the due execution and delivery by such Seller of
this Agreement and each other Transaction Document to which it is a party and
the performance of its obligations hereunder and thereunder.



                                      -8-
<PAGE>

                  (e) Actions, Suits. There is no litigation, arbitration,
governmental investigation, proceeding or inquiry pending or, to the knowledge
of any of its Senior Executives, threatened against or affecting such Seller or
any of its Subsidiaries that, if adversely determined, would have a Seller
Material Adverse Effect or which seeks to prevent, enjoin or delay any Purchase.

                  (f) Binding Effect. This Agreement and each other Transaction
Document to which such Seller is a party constitute the legal, valid and binding
obligations of such Seller enforceable against such Seller in accordance with
their respective terms, except as such enforcement may be limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar laws relating to or
limiting creditors' rights generally and by general principles of equity
(regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding in equity or at
law).

                  (g) Accuracy of Information.

                  (i) All written representations, warranties, reports or
certificates of any Seller's Senior Executives heretofore furnished by such
Seller to its applicable Transferee (or its assigns) for purposes of or in
connection with this Agreement, any of the other Transaction Documents or any
transaction contemplated hereby or thereby are, and all such written
representations, warranties, reports or certificates hereafter furnished by such
Seller to its applicable Transferee (or its assigns) shall be, complete and
correct and fairly present the information contained therein as of the date such
information is certified and do not and will not contain any material
misstatement of fact as of such date or omit to state a material fact or any
fact necessary to make the information contained therein, taken as a whole with
all other written or verbal information provided by such Seller's Senior
Executives as of such date, not misleading.

                  (ii) To the best of such Seller's knowledge, all verbal
information furnished by any Senior Executive of such Seller to its applicable
Transferee (or its assigns) for purposes of or in connection with this
Agreement, any of the other Transaction Documents or any transaction
contemplated hereby or thereby are, and all such verbal information hereafter
furnished by any Senior Executive of such Seller to its applicable Transferee
(or its assigns) shall be, complete and correct as of the date when made and
will not contain any material misstatement of fact as of such date or omit to
state a material fact or any fact necessary to make such information, taken as a
whole with all other written or verbal information provided by such Seller's
Senior Executives as of such date, not misleading.

                  (h) Use of Proceeds. No portion of any Purchase Price payment
hereunder will be used for a purpose that violates, or would be inconsistent
with, any law, rule or regulation applicable to such Seller.

                  (i) Good Title. Immediately prior to each Purchase from such
Seller hereunder and upon the creation of each Receivable originated after the
Initial Cut-Off Date, such Seller (i) is the legal and beneficial owner of such
Receivable and the Collections with respect thereto and (ii) is the legal and
beneficial owner of the Related Security with respect thereto or possesses a
valid and perfected security interest therein, in each case, free and clear of
any Adverse Claim, except as created by the Transaction Documents and the Loan
Agreement.



                                      -9-
<PAGE>

                  (j) Perfection. This Agreement, together with the filing of
the financing statements contemplated hereby, is effective to transfer to such
Seller's applicable Transferee (and such Transferee shall acquire from such
Seller): (i) legal and equitable title to, with the right to sell and encumber
each Receivable originated or acquired by such Seller, whether now existing and
hereafter arising, together with the Collections with respect thereto, and (ii)
all of such Seller's right, title and interest in the Related Security
associated with each such Receivable, in each case, free and clear of any
Adverse Claim, except as created by the Transactions Documents and the Loan
Agreement. There have been duly filed all financing statements or other similar
instruments or documents necessary under the UCC (or any comparable law) of all
appropriate jurisdictions to perfect Buyer's ownership interest in such
Receivables, the Related Security and the Collections.

                  (k) Chief Executive Office and Locations of Records. The
location of the chief executive office of such Seller and the offices where it
keeps all of its Receivable Files are located at the address(es) listed on
Exhibit II or such other locations of which Buyer has been notified in
accordance with Section 4.2(a) in jurisdictions where all action required by
Section 4.2(a) has been taken and completed. Such Seller's Organizational
Identification Number is correctly set forth on Exhibit II.

                  (l) LockBoxes, Etc. The addresses of all existing LockBoxes
and the related banks, account names and account numbers for all existing
LockBox Accounts are correctly listed on Exhibit III. Each of the LockBox
Accounts has been transferred into Buyer's name. Such Seller has not granted any
Person, other than Buyer (and the Administrative Agent, as its pledgee) dominion
and control of any LockBox or LockBox Account, or the right to take dominion and
control of any such LockBox or LockBox Account at a future time or upon the
occurrence of a future event.

                  (m) Seller Material Adverse Effect. Since the last day of the
fiscal year of such Seller as to which financial statements have most recently
been delivered pursuant to Section 4.1(a)(i), no event has occurred and is
continuing that would have a Seller Material Adverse Effect.

                  (n) Names. The name in which such Seller has executed this
Agreement is identical to the name of such Seller as indicated on the public
record of its jurisdiction of organization as listed on Exhibit II hereto. In
the past five (5) years, such Seller has not used any legal names, trade names
or assumed names other than the name in which it has executed this Agreement and
as listed on Exhibit II.

                  (o) Ownership. Bowater owns 100% of the issued and outstanding
equity interests of Lake Superior, Lake Superior owns 100% of the issued and
outstanding equity interests of BAI, and BAI owns 100% of the issued and
outstanding equity interests of Buyer. All such equity interests are validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable, and there are no options, warrants or
other rights to acquire securities of any Seller (other than Bowater) or Buyer.

<PAGE>

                  (p) Not a Holding Company or an Investment Company. Such
Seller is not a "holding company" or a "subsidiary holding company" of a
"holding company" within the meaning of the Public Utility Holding Company Act
of 1935, as amended, or any successor statute. Such Seller is not an "investment
company" within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended,
or any successor statute.

                  (q) Compliance with Law. Such Seller has complied with all
applicable laws, rules, regulations, orders, writs, judgments, injunctions,
decrees or awards to which it is subject, except where the failure to so comply
would not have a Seller Material Adverse Effect. Each Receivable transferred by
such Seller, together with the Contract related thereto, does not contravene any
laws, rules or regulations applicable thereto (including, without limitation,
laws, rules and regulations relating to truth in lending, fair credit billing,
fair credit reporting, equal credit opportunity, fair debt collection practices
and privacy), and no part of such Contract is in violation of any such law, rule
or regulation, except where such contravention or violation could not reasonably
be expected to have a Seller Material Adverse Effect.

                  (r) Compliance with Credit and Collection Policy. With regard
to each Receivable transferred by such Seller, such Seller has complied in all
material respects with the Credit and Collection Policy and the related
Contract. Such Seller has not made any change in or amendment to the Credit and
Collection Policy, except (i) to the extent such change or amendment would not
be reasonably likely to materially and adversely affect the collectibility of
Receivables transferred by such Seller or to materially decrease the credit
quality of any newly created Receivables in any material respect or (ii) to the
extent such change or amendment has been consented to by the Buyer and the
Co-Agents.

                  (s) Payments to Seller. With regard to each Receivable sold by
such Seller, the Purchase Price received by such Seller constitutes reasonably
equivalent value in consideration therefor. No transfer hereunder by such Seller
of any Receivable is or may be voidable under any section of the Bankruptcy
Reform Act of 1978 (11 U.S.C. ss.ss.101 et seq.), as amended.

                  (t) Enforceability of Contracts. As of the Purchase Date of
each Receivable transferred by such Seller, each Contract with respect to such
Receivable is, on such date, effective to create, and has created, a legally
valid and binding obligation of the related Obligor to pay the Outstanding
Balance of the Receivable created thereunder and any accrued interest thereon,
enforceable against the Obligor in accordance with its terms, except as such
enforcement may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization
or other similar laws relating to or limiting creditors' rights generally and by
general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a
proceeding in equity or at law).

                  (u) Accounting. The manner in which such Seller accounts for
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in its financial statements does
not jeopardize the characterization of the transactions contemplated herein as
being true sales.

                  (v) Solvency. Such Seller is Solvent.

                                  ARTICLE III
                             CONDITIONS OF PURCHASE

                  Section 3.1 Conditions Precedent to Initial Purchase. The
initial Purchase under this Agreement is subject to the conditions precedent
that (a) Buyer shall have been capitalized with the Initial Contributed
Receivables and not less than $300,000 of cash, (b) Buyer shall have received on
or before the Closing Date those documents listed on Schedule A, and (c) all of
the conditions to the initial Loan under the Loan Agreement shall have been
satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms thereof.

                  Section 3.2 Conditions Precedent to Subsequent Payments. Each
applicable Transferee's obligation to pay for Receivables coming into existence
after the Initial Cutoff Date shall be subject to the further conditions
precedent that: (a) the Commitment Termination Date shall not have occurred
under the Loan Agreement; (b) Buyer (and the Administrative Agent as its
pledgee) shall not have received written notice that the indebtedness under the
Bowater Credit Agreement has been accelerated (it being understood that this
condition precedent cannot be waived by Buyer or its assigns); (c) Buyer (or its
assigns) shall have received such other documents as it may reasonably request;
and (d) on the date such Receivable came into existence, the following
statements shall be true (and acceptance of the proceeds of any payment for such
Receivable shall be deemed a representation and warranty by the applicable
Seller that such statements are then true):

                  (i) the representations and warranties of such Seller set
         forth in Article II are true and correct on and as of the date such
         Receivable came into existence as though made on and as of such date;
         and

                  (ii) no event has occurred and is continuing that constitutes
         a Termination Event.

                  Notwithstanding the foregoing conditions precedent, upon the
applicable Purchase Date for a Receivable (prior to the occurrence of a
Termination Event), title to such Receivable and the Related Security and
Collections with respect thereto shall vest in the applicable Transferee,
whether or not the conditions precedent to such Transferee's obligation to pay
for such Receivable were in fact satisfied and whether or not the Purchase Price
has actually been paid as of such date. If any Seller fails to satisfy any of
the foregoing conditions precedent, however, Buyer, as the ultimate Transferee,
may rescind the related Purchase and direct BAI to pay to Buyer (and BAI and
Lake Superior may, in turn direct their applicable Sellers to pay to them) an
amount equal to the Purchase Price payment, if any, made with respect to the
Receivables included in such Purchase.

                                   ARTICLE IV
                                    COVENANTS

                  Section 4.1 Affirmative Covenants of Each Seller. Until the
date on which this Agreement terminates in accordance with its terms, each
Seller hereby covenants as set forth below:

<PAGE>

                  (a) Financial Reporting. Bowater will maintain, for itself and

                           (ii) Quarterly Reporting. Within 60 days after the
close of the first three quarterly periods of each of its fiscal years, for

certified (subject to normal year-end adjustments) as to fairness of
presentation, preparation in accordance with GAAP and consistency by a Financial
Officer of Bowater; provided that delivery of a copy of Bowater's Forms 10-Q

transferred by such Seller or to materially decrease the credit quality of any
newly created Receivables in any material respect, requesting Buyer's (and the
Co-Agents') consent thereto, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed.

                           (v) Other Information. Promptly, from time to time,
such other information, documents, records or reports relating to the

Event.

                           (ii) Judgment and Proceedings. The institution of any

Seller will comply in all respects with all applicable laws, rules, regulations,
orders, writs, judgments, injunctions, decrees or awards to which it is then
subject, except where the failure to so comply could not reasonably be expected
to have a Seller Material Adverse Effect. Such Seller will preserve and maintain
its legal existence, rights, franchises and privileges in the jurisdiction of
its organization, and qualify and remain qualified in good standing as a foreign
entity in each jurisdiction where its business is conducted, except where the
failure to so qualify or remain in good standing could not reasonably be
expected to have a Seller Material Adverse Effect.

                  (d) Audits. Such Seller will furnish to Buyer and the
Administrative Agent (as Buyer's pledgee) from time to time such information
with respect to such Seller and the Receivables transferred by it as Buyer or
the Administrative Agent may reasonably request. Such Seller will, from time to
time during regular business hours as requested by Buyer (or the Administrative
Agent), upon reasonable notice and at the sole cost of such Seller, permit an

examining such materials described in clause (i) above, and to discuss matters
relating to such Seller's financial condition or the Receivables and the Related
Security or such Seller's performance under any of the Transaction Documents or
such Seller's performance under the Contracts and, in each case, with any of the
officers or employees of such Seller having knowledge of such matters; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that, prior to a Bowater Downgrade and in the absence of a Termination
Event, Sellers will only be required to pay for up to one (1) such examination

the Sellers shall only be required to pay for up to two (2) such examinations in
any calendar year, and PROVIDED FURTHER, that from and after the occurrence of a
Termination Event, the Sellers shall be responsible to pay for, and the
Administrative Agent (or its representatives) shall be entitled to



                                      -14-

conduct, as many examinations as Buyer or the Administrative Agent may deem
necessary or appropriate to protect the interests of the Buyer and the Secured
Parties.

                  (e) Keeping and Marking of Records and Books.

                           (i) Such Seller will maintain and implement
         administrative and operating procedures (including, without limitation,
         an ability to recreate records evidencing Receivables in the event of
         the destruction of the originals thereof), and keep and maintain all
         documents, books, records and other information reasonably necessary or
         advisable for the collection of all Receivables (including, without
         limitation, records adequate to permit the immediate identification of
         each new Receivable and all Collections of and adjustments to each
         existing Receivable). Such Seller will give Buyer (or its assigns)
         notice of any material change in the administrative and operating
         procedures referred to in the previous sentence.

                           (ii) Such Seller will (A) on or prior to the Closing
         Date, mark its master data processing records and other books and
         records relating to the Receivables with a legend, acceptable to Buyer
         (or its assigns), describing Buyer's ownership interests in the
         Receivables and further describing the security interest of the
         Administrative Agent (on behalf of the Secured Parties) under the Loan
         Agreement and (B) upon the request of Buyer (or its assigns) from and
         after the occurrence of a Termination Event: (x) mark each invoice
         evidencing any Receivable with a legend describing Buyer's ownership
         thereof and further describing the security interest of the
         Administrative Agent (on behalf of the Agents and the Lenders) and (y)
         at any time after such Seller (or one of its Affiliates) is no longer
         acting as Servicer, deliver to Buyer (or its assigns) all Contracts
         relating to such Receivables.

                  (f) Compliance with Contracts and Credit and Collection
Policy. Such Seller will timely and fully (i) perform and comply in all material
respects with all provisions, covenants and other promises required to be
observed by it under the Contracts related to the Receivables hereunder, and
(ii) comply in all material respects with the Credit and Collection Policy in
regard to each such Receivable and the related Contract.

                  (g) Ownership. Such Seller will take all necessary action to
establish and maintain, irrevocably in Buyer as ultimate Transferee: (A) legal
and equitable title to the Receivables transferred by it and the related
Collections and (B) all of such Seller's right, title and interest in the
Related Security associated with the Receivables described in the preceding
clause (A), in each case, free and clear of any Adverse Claims other than the
Adverse Claims in favor of Buyer (and its assigns) (INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, the filing of all financing statements or other similar instruments
or documents necessary under the UCC (or any comparable law) of all appropriate
jurisdictions to perfect Buyer's interest in such Receivables, Related Security
and Collections and such other action to perfect, protect or more fully evidence
the interest of Buyer as Buyer (or its assigns) may reasonably request).

                  (h) Agents' and Lenders' Reliance. Such Seller acknowledges
that the Agents and Lenders are entering into the transactions contemplated by
the Loan Agreement in reliance



                                      -15-
<PAGE>

upon Buyer's identity as a legal entity that is separate from such Seller and
any Affiliates thereof. Therefore, from and after the Closing Date, such Seller
will take all reasonable steps within such Seller's control to maintain Buyer's
identity as a separate legal entity and to make it manifest to third parties
that Buyer is an entity with assets and liabilities distinct from those of such
Seller and any Affiliates thereof and not just a division of such Seller or any
such Affiliate. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing and in addition
to the other covenants set forth herein, such Seller (i) will not hold itself
out to third parties as liable for the debts of Buyer nor purport to own any of
the Receivables and other assets acquired by Buyer, (ii) will not take any
action that would cause Buyer to violate the "separateness covenants" set forth
in Section 9.1.7 of the Loan Agreement and (iii) will cause all tax liabilities
arising in connection with the transactions contemplated herein or otherwise to
be allocated between such Seller and Buyer on an arm's-length basis and in a
manner consistent with the procedures set forth in U.S. Treasury Regulations
ss.ss.1.1502-33(d) and 1.1552-1.

                  (i) Collections. In the event any payments relating to
Receivables transferred by such Seller are remitted directly to such Seller or
any Affiliate of such Seller, such Seller will remit (or will cause all such
payments to be remitted) directly to a Lockbox Account which is in Buyer's name
and listed on Exhibit III hereto within three (3) Business Days following
receipt thereof and, at all times prior to such remittance, such Seller will
itself hold or, if applicable, will cause such payments to be held in trust for
the exclusive benefit of Buyer and its assigns. Such Seller will transfer
exclusive ownership, dominion and control of each LockBox and LockBox Account to
Buyer and, will not grant the right to take dominion and control of any LockBox
or any LockBox Account at a future time or upon the occurrence of a future event
to any Person, except to Buyer, as contemplated by this Agreement, and to the
Administrative Agent, as contemplated by the Loan Agreement.

                  (j) Taxes. Such Seller will file all tax returns and reports
required by law to be filed by it and promptly pay all Covered Taxes at any time
owing, except any such Covered Taxes which are not yet delinquent or are being
diligently contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and for which
adequate reserves in accordance with GAAP shall have been set aside on its
books.

                  Section 4.2 Negative Covenants of Each Seller. Until the date
on which this Agreement terminates in accordance with its terms, each Seller
hereby covenants that:

                  (a) Name Change, Offices and Records. Such Seller will not
change its (i) state of organization, (ii) legal name, (iii) identity or
structure (within the meaning of Article 9 of any applicable enactment of the
UCC) or any office where Receivable Files are kept unless, in each of the
foregoing cases, it shall have: (A) given Buyer (and the Administrative Agent as
Buyer's pledgee) at least ten (10) Business Days' prior written notice thereof
and (B) delivered to the Administrative Agent (as Buyer's pledgee) all financing
statements, instruments and other documents reasonably requested by Buyer (or
the Administrative Agent, as Buyer's pledgee) in connection with such change or
relocation.

                  (b) Change in Payment Instructions to Obligors. Such Seller
will not add or terminate any LockBox or LockBox Account, or make any change in
the instructions to Obligors



                                      -16-
<PAGE>

regarding payments to be made to any LockBox or any LockBox Account, unless
Buyer and the Administrative Agent shall have received, at least ten (10) days
before the proposed effective date therefor, (i) written notice of such
addition, termination or change and (ii) with respect to the addition of a
LockBox or LockBox Account, an executed LockBox Account Agreement; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that Seller may make changes in instructions to Obligors regarding
payments if such new instructions require such Obligor to make payments to
another existing LockBox or LockBox Account.

                  (c) Modifications to Contracts and Credit and Collection
Policy. Such Seller will not, without the consent of the Buyer and the
Co-Agents, make any change to the Credit and Collection Policy that could
reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect the collectibility of
the Receivables transferred by it or materially decrease the credit quality of
any of its newly created Receivables. Except (i) in accordance with the Credit
and Collection Policy and (ii) as otherwise permitted hereunder and under the
Loan Agreement, if such Seller is acting as Servicer pursuant to the Loan
Agreement, such Seller will not extend, amend or otherwise modify the terms of
any Receivable or any Contract related thereto.

                  (d) Sales, Adverse Claims. Such Seller will not sell, assign
(by operation of law or otherwise) or otherwise dispose of, or grant any option
with respect to, or create or suffer to exist any Adverse Claim upon (including,
without limitation, the filing of any financing statement) or with respect to,
any Receivable, Related Security or Collections, or upon or with respect to any
Contract under which any Receivable arises, or any LockBox or any LockBox
Account, or assign any right to receive income with respect thereto (other than,
in each case, the creation of the interests therein in favor of Buyer, as
provided for herein, and of Lenders, as provided for in the Loan Agreement), and
such Seller will defend the right, title and interest of Buyer in, to and under
any of the foregoing property, against all claims of third parties claiming
through or under such Seller.

                  (e) Accounting for Purchases. Such Seller will not, and will
not permit any Affiliate to, account for the transactions contemplated hereby in
any financial statements in any manner other than the sale (or other outright
conveyance) by such Seller to the applicable Transferee of the Receivables and
the associated Collections and Related Security except to the extent that such
transactions are not recognized on account of consolidated financial reporting
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

                               TERMINATION EVENTS

                  Section 5.1 Termination Events. The occurrence of any one or
more of the following events shall constitute a Termination Event:

         required hereunder when due and such failure shall continue for three
         (3) consecutive Business Days.

                  (b) Any representation, warranty, certification or statement
         made by any Seller in this Agreement, any other Transaction Document or
         in any other document



                                      -17-
<PAGE>

         delivered pursuant hereto or thereto shall prove to have been incorrect
         in any material respect when made or deemed made; PROVIDED THAT the
         materiality threshold in the preceding clause shall not be applicable
         with respect to any representation or warranty which itself contains a
         materiality threshold and PROVIDED FURTHER, that any such incorrect
         representation, warranty, certification or statement relating to a
         Receivable for which Buyer has actually received a Purchase Price
         Credit shall not constitute a Termination Event hereunder.

                  (c) Any Seller shall breach any covenant contained in Section
         4.1(b)(i) which is not cured within three (3) days, or any Seller shall
         breach any covenant contained in Section 4.2(c) or 4.2(e), which is not
         cured within thirty (30) days, or any Seller shall breach any other
         covenant contained in Section 4.2(a), (b) or (d).

                  (d) Any Seller shall breach, fail to perform or observe any
         covenant contained in any Section of this Agreement (which is not
         covered by another subsection, paragraph or clause of this Section 5.1)
         or of any other Transaction Document to which it is a party which is
         not cured within thirty (30) days after written notice from Buyer (or
         the Administrative Agent, as Buyer's pledgee).

                  (e) Failure of any Seller or any of its Subsidiaries to pay
         any Material Debt when due; or the default by any Seller or any of its
         Subsidiaries in the performance of any term, provision or condition
         contained in any agreement under which any Material Debt was created or
         is governed, or any other event shall occur or condition exist, the
         effect of which is to cause, or to permit the holder or holders of such
         Material Debt to cause such Material Debt to become due prior to its
         stated maturity; or Material Debt of any Seller or any of its
         Subsidiaries shall be declared to be due and payable or required to be
         prepaid (other than by a regularly scheduled payment or as a result of
         the sale of an asset securing such Material Debt) prior to the stated
         maturity thereof.

                  (f) (i) Any Seller shall generally not pay its debts as such
         debts become due or shall admit in writing its inability to pay its
         debts generally or shall make a general assignment for the benefit of
         creditors; or (ii) any proceeding shall be instituted by or against any
         Seller seeking to adjudicate it bankrupt or insolvent, or seeking
         liquidation, winding up, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment,
         protection, relief or composition of it or its debts under any law
         relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization or relief of
         debtors, or seeking the entry of an order for relief or the appointment
         of a receiver, trustee or other similar official for it or any
         substantial part of its property, and, if against Seller, any such
         proceeding or case shall continue undismissed for a period of sixty
         (60) or more days, or (iii) any Seller shall take any corporate action
         to authorize any of the actions set forth in the foregoing clauses (i)
         or (ii) of this subsection (f).

                  (g) A Change of Control shall occur.

         excess of $10,000,000 in the aggregate (exclusive of judgment amounts

         bodies having jurisdiction against any Seller or any of its
         Subsidiaries and the same shall not be discharged (or provision shall
         not be made for such discharge), or a stay of execution thereof shall
         not be procured, within thirty (30) days from the date of entry thereof
         and the Company or the relevant Subsidiary shall not, within said
         period of thirty (30) days, or such longer period during which
         execution of the same shall have been stayed, appeal therefrom and
         cause the execution thereof to be stayed during such appeal

                  (i) The Subordinated Note shall be assigned, pledged or
         otherwise transferred to any Person in violation of the last section
         thereof.

                  Section 5.2 Remedies.

                  Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of a
Termination Event, Buyer may take any of the following actions: (i) declare the
Termination Date to have occurred, whereupon the Termination Date shall
forthwith occur, without demand, protest or further notice of any kind, all of
which are hereby expressly waived by each Seller; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that upon
the occurrence of a Termination Event described in Section 5.1(f), or of an
actual or deemed entry of an order for relief with respect to any Seller under
the Federal Bankruptcy Code, the Termination Date shall automatically occur,
without demand, protest or any notice of any kind, all of which are hereby
expressly waived by each Seller and (ii) to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law, declare that the Default Fee shall accrue with respect to any
amounts then due and owing by each Seller to any Transferee. The aforementioned
rights and remedies shall be without limitation and shall be in addition to all
other rights and remedies of each of the Transferees and its assigns otherwise
available under any other provision of this Agreement, by operation of law, at
equity or otherwise, all of which are hereby expressly preserved, including,
without limitation, all rights and remedies provided under the UCC, all of which
rights shall be cumulative.

                                 INDEMNIFICATION

                  Section 6.1 Indemnities by Sellers. Without limiting any other
rights that any Transferee may have hereunder or under applicable law, each
Seller hereby agrees to indemnify (and pay upon demand to) each Transferee and
its assigns, officers, directors, agents and employees (each a "SELLER
INDEMNIFIED PARTY") from and against any and all damages, losses, claims,
Covered Taxes, liabilities, costs, expenses and for all other amounts payable,

                           (ii) the failure by such Seller, to comply with any
         applicable law, rule or regulation with respect to any Receivable
         transferred by it or any Contract related thereto, or the nonconformity
         of any such Receivable or Contract included therein with any such

         discharge in bankruptcy of the Obligor or failure to pay due to
         financial inability) of the Obligor to the payment of any Receivable

         based on such Receivable or the related Contract not being a legal,
         valid and binding obligation of such Obligor enforceable against it in
         accordance with its terms), or any other claim resulting from the sale
         of the merchandise or service related to such Receivable or the

EXCLUDING, HOWEVER, (a) Seller Indemnified Amounts to the extent a final

Seller Indemnified Party seeking indemnification; (b) Seller Indemnified Amounts
to the extent the same includes losses in respect of Receivables that are
uncollectible on account of the insolvency, bankruptcy, financial inability to
pay or lack of creditworthiness of the related Obligor; and (c) Excluded Taxes.
Nothing in this Section 6.1 shall limit the liability of any Seller or limit the
recourse of any applicable Transferee (or its assigns) to such Seller for
amounts otherwise specifically provided to be paid by such Seller under the
terms of this Agreement.

                  Anything contained in this Section 6.1 to the contrary
notwithstanding: (1) the foregoing indemnification is not intended to, and shall
not, constitute a guarantee of the collectibility or payment of the Receivables
conveyed hereunder, and (2) nothing in this Section 6.1 shall require any Seller
to indemnify any Seller Indemnified Party for Receivables which are not
collected, not paid or are otherwise uncollected on account of the insolvency,
bankruptcy, lack of creditworthiness or financial inability to pay of the
applicable Obligor.

                  Section 6.2 Other Costs and Expenses. Subject to Section
4.1(d), each Seller agrees to pay to its applicable Transferee, on demand, all
reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses in connection with (a) the
preparation, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other documents to
be delivered hereunder, (b) the preparation, execution and delivery of any
amendment hereto or waiver hereof requested by such Seller, and (b) any and all
costs and expenses of such Transferee, if any, including reasonable counsel fees
and expenses, in connection with the enforcement of this Agreement and the other
documents delivered hereunder.

                  Section 6.3 Taxes. All payments by each Seller to or for the
account of its Transferee (or any of its assigns) hereunder or under any other
Transaction Document to which such Seller is a party shall be made free and
clear of and without deduction for any and all Covered Taxes. If any Seller
shall be required by law to deduct any Covered Taxes from or in respect of any
sum payable hereunder to its applicable Transferee (or any of its assigns), (a)
the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all
required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable
under this Section 6.3), such Transferee (or such assign, as the case may be)
receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such
deductions been made, (b) such Seller shall make such deductions, (c) such
Seller shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant authority in
accordance with



                                      -21-

applicable law and (d) such Seller shall furnish to such Transferee (and to the
Administrative Agent, as the Buyer's pledgee) the original copy of a receipt
evidencing payment thereof within 30 days after such payment is made.

                  Section 7.1 Waivers and Amendments.

                  (a) No failure or delay on the part of any Transferee (or its
         assigns) in exercising any power, right or remedy under this Agreement
         shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial
         exercise of any such power, right or remedy preclude any other further
         exercise thereof or the exercise of any other power, right or remedy.
         The rights and remedies herein provided shall be cumulative and
         nonexclusive of any rights or remedies provided by law. Any waiver of

         the specific purpose for which given.

                  (b) No provision of this Agreement may be amended,
         supplemented, modified or waived except in writing signed by Sellers
         and Buyer and, to the extent required under the Loan Agreement, the
         Agents. Any material amendment, supplement, modification of waiver may
         require the applicable Conduit Lender's receipt of written notice from
         the rating agencies who rate its Commercial Paper Notes that such
         change will not cause the rating on the then outstanding Commercial
         Paper Notes to be downgraded or withdrawn.

                  Section 7.2 Notices. All communications and notices provided
for hereunder shall be in writing (including bank wire, telecopy or electronic
facsimile transmission or similar writing) and shall be given to the other
parties hereto at their respective addresses or telecopy numbers set forth on
Schedule B hereto or at such other address or telecopy number as such Person may
hereafter specify for the purpose of notice to each of the other parties hereto.
Each such notice or other communication shall be effective (a) if given by
telecopy, upon the receipt thereof, (b) if given by mail, five (5) Business Days
after the time such communication is deposited in the mail with first class
postage prepaid or (c) if given by any other means, when received at the address
specified in this Section 7.2.

                  Section 7.3 Protection of Ownership Interests of Buyer.

                  (a) Each Seller agrees that from time to time, at its expense,
         it will promptly execute and deliver all instruments and documents, and
         take all actions, that may be necessary or desirable, or that Buyer (or
         its assigns) may reasonably request, to perfect, protect or more fully
         evidence the interest of Buyer and its assigns therein, or to enable
         Buyer (or its assigns) to exercise and enforce all rights and remedies
         afforded to any Transferee hereunder. At any time following the earlier
         to occur of a Termination Event or an Amortization Event: Buyer (or its
         assigns) may, at the applicable Seller's sole cost and expense, direct
         each Seller to notify the Obligors of Receivables transferred by it of
         the ownership interests of Buyer under this Agreement and may also
         direct that payments of all amounts due or that become due under any or
         all Receivables transferred by it be made directly to Buyer or its
         designee.

         therewith shall be payable by such Seller as provided in Section 6.2;

                           (ii) Each Seller irrevocably authorizes Buyer (and
         its assigns) at any time and from time to time in the sole discretion
         of Buyer (or its assigns), and appoints Buyer (and its assigns) as its
         attorney(ies)-in-fact, to act on behalf of such Seller (A) to execute
         (if necessary) on behalf of such Seller as debtor and to file (with or,
         to the extent permitted by applicable law, without signatures)
         financing statements necessary or desirable in Buyer's (or its

                       [FORM OF] PURCHASE PRICE LOAN NOTE

                            PURCHASE PRICE LOAN NOTE

                                                               December 19, 2002

                  1. Note. FOR VALUE RECEIVED, the undersigned, Bowater
America Inc., a Delaware corporation ("TRANSFEREE"), hereby unconditionally
promises to pay to the order of Bowater Incorporated, a Delaware corporation
("SELLER"), in lawful money of the United States of America and in immediately
available funds, upon demand, the aggregate unpaid principal sum outstanding of
all Purchase Price Loans made from time to time by Seller to Transferee pursuant
to and in accordance with the terms of that certain Receivables Sale Agreement
dated as of December 19, 2002 among Seller, Transferee and certain of their
affiliates (as amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time
to time, the "SALE AGREEMENT"). Reference to Sections 1.2(c) and 1.3(b) of the
Sale Agreement is hereby made for a statement of the terms and conditions under
which the loans evidenced hereby have been and will be made. CAPITALIZED TERMS
USED AND NOT OTHERWISE DEFINED HEREIN SHALL HAVE THE MEANINGS ASCRIBED TO SUCH
TERMS IN THE SALE AGREEMENT.

                  2. Interest. Transferee further promises to pay interest
on the outstanding unpaid principal amount hereof from the date of the initial
Purchase Price Loan hereunder until payment in full hereof at a rate per annum
equal to the Prime Rate (as hereinafter defined); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if
Transferee shall default in the payment of any principal hereof, Transferee
promises to pay, on demand, interest at the rate equal to the Prime Rate plus
2.00% per annum on any such unpaid amounts, from the date such payment is due to
the date of actual payment. Interest shall be payable on the first Business Day
of each month in arrears; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that Transferee may elect on the
date any interest payment is due hereunder to defer such payment and upon such
election the amount of interest due but unpaid on such date shall constitute
principal under this Purchase Price Loan Note. The outstanding principal of any
loan made under this Purchase Price Loan Note may be repaid or prepaid at any
time without premium or penalty. As used herein, "PRIME RATE" means a rate per
annum equal to the prime rate published from time to time in THE WALL STREET
JOURNAL, changing when and as such published rate changes and shall be computed
for actual days elapsed on the basis of a year consisting of 360 days.

                  3. Principal. Seller is authorized and directed by
Transferee to enter on the grid attached hereto, or, at its option, in its books
and records, the date and amount of each Purchase Price Loan and the amount of
each payment of principal made by Transferee, and absent manifest error, such
entries shall constitute prima facie evidence of the accuracy of the information
so entered; PROVIDED THAT neither the failure of Seller to make any such entry
or any error therein shall expand, limit or affect the obligations of Transferee
hereunder.

                  4. GOVERNING LAW. THIS PURCHASE PRICE LOAN NOTE SHALL BE
GOVERNED BY THE INTERNAL LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK



                                      -42-

WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CONFLICT OF LAW PRINCIPLES THEREOF (OTHER THAN SECTION
5-1401 OF THE NEW YORK GENERAL OBLIGATIONS LAW). WHEREVER POSSIBLE EACH
PROVISION OF THIS PURCHASE PRICE LOAN NOTE SHALL BE INTERPRETED IN SUCH MANNER
AS TO BE EFFECTIVE AND VALID UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, BUT IF ANY PROVISION OF THIS
PURCHASE PRICE LOAN NOTE SHALL BE PROHIBITED BY OR INVALID UNDER APPLICABLE LAW,
SUCH PROVISION SHALL BE INEFFECTIVE TO THE EXTENT OF SUCH PROHIBITION OR
INVALIDITY, WITHOUT INVALIDATING THE REMAINDER OF SUCH PROVISION OR THE
REMAINING PROVISIONS OF THIS PURCHASE PRICE LOAN NOTE.

                  5. Waivers. All parties hereto, whether as makers,
endorsers, or otherwise, severally waive presentment for payment, demand,
protest and notice of dishonor.

                                SUBORDINATED NOTE

                                                               December 19, 2002

                  1. Note. FOR VALUE RECEIVED, the undersigned, Bowater
Funding Inc., a Delaware corporation ("BUYER"), hereby unconditionally promises
to pay to the order of Bowater America Inc., a Delaware corporation ("BAI"), in
lawful money of the United States of America and in immediately available funds,
on or before the date following the Termination Date which is one year and one
day after the date on which (i) the Outstanding Balance of all Receivables sold
by BAI under that certain Receivables Sale Agreement dated as of December 19,
2002 between BAI and certain of its affiliates and Buyer (as amended, restated,
supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the "SALE AGREEMENT") has
been reduced to zero and (ii) BAI has paid to Buyer all indemnities, adjustments
and other amounts which may be owed thereunder in connection with the Purchases
thereunder (the "COLLECTION DATE"), the aggregate unpaid principal sum
outstanding of all Subordinated Loans made from time to time by BAI to Buyer
pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of the Sale Agreement. Reference to
Sections 1.2(c) and 1.3(b) of the Sale Agreement is hereby made for a statement
of the terms and conditions under which the loans evidenced hereby have been and
will be made. CAPITALIZED TERMS USED AND NOT OTHERWISE DEFINED HEREIN SHALL HAVE
THE MEANINGS ASCRIBED TO SUCH TERMS IN THE SALE AGREEMENT.

                  2. Interest. Buyer further promises to pay interest on
the outstanding unpaid principal amount hereof from the date of the initial
Subordinated Loan hereunder until payment in full hereof at a rate per annum
equal to the Prime Rate (as hereinafter defined); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if
Buyer shall default in the payment of any principal hereof, Buyer promises to
pay, on demand, interest at the rate equal to the Prime Rate plus 2.00% per
annum on any such unpaid amounts, from the date such payment is due to the date
of actual payment. Interest shall be payable on the first Business Day of each
month in arrears; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that Buyer may elect on the date any
interest payment is due hereunder to defer such payment and upon such election
the amount of interest due but unpaid on such date shall constitute principal
under this Subordinated Note. The outstanding principal of any loan made under
this Subordinated Note shall be due and payable on the Collection Date and may
be repaid or prepaid at any time without premium or penalty. As used herein,
"PRIME RATE" means a rate per annum equal to the prime rate published from time
to time in THE WALL STREET JOURNAL, changing when and as such published rate
changes and shall be computed for actual days elapsed on the basis of a year
consisting of 360 days.

                  3. Principal. BAI is authorized and directed by Buyer to
enter on the grid attached hereto, or, at its option, in its books and records,
the date and amount of each Subordinated Loan and the amount of each payment of
principal made by Buyer, and absent manifest error, such entries shall
constitute prima facie evidence of the accuracy of the



                                      -45-
<PAGE>

information so entered; PROVIDED THAT neither the failure of BAI to make any
such entry or any error therein shall expand, limit or affect the obligations of
Buyer hereunder.

                  4. Subordination. BAI shall have the right to receive,
and Buyer shall make, any and all payments and prepayments relating to the loans
made under this Subordinated Note, PROVIDED THAT, after giving effect to any
such payment or prepayment, the aggregate Outstanding Balance of Receivables
owned by Buyer at such time exceeds any and all then outstanding "Obligations"
under and as defined in that certain Loan Agreement dated as of December 19,
2002 by and among Buyer, Bowater Incorporated, as initial Servicer, various
lenders and co-agents, and SunTrust Capital Markets, Inc., a Tennessee
corporation, as "Administrative Agent" (as amended, restated, supplemented or
otherwise modified from time to time, the "LOAN AGREEMENT"). BAI hereby agrees
that at any time during which the conditions set forth in the proviso of the
immediately preceding sentence shall not be satisfied, BAI shall be subordinate
in right of payment to the prior payment of all Obligations under and as defined
under the Loan Agreement. The subordination provisions contained herein are for
the direct benefit of, and may be enforced by, Administrative Agent, on behalf
of the Secured Parties under and as defined in the Loan Agreement
(Administrative Agent and the Secured Parties being hereinafter collectively
referred to as the "SENIOR CLAIMANTS"). Until the date on which the
"Obligations" under and as defined in the Loan Agreement (all such Obligations,
collectively, the "SENIOR CLAIM") have been indefeasibly paid and satisfied in
full, BAI shall not institute against Buyer any proceeding of the type described
in Section 5.1(f) of the Sale Agreement unless and until the Collection Date has
occurred. Should any payment, distribution or security or proceeds thereof be
received by BAI in violation of this Section 4, BAI agrees that such payment
shall be segregated, received and held in trust for the benefit of, and deemed
to be the property of, and shall be immediately paid over and delivered to
Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Senior Claimants.

                  5. Bankruptcy; Insolvency. Upon the occurrence of any
proceeding of the type described in Section 5.1(f) of the Sale Agreement
involving Buyer as debtor, then and in any such event the Senior Claimants shall
receive payment in full of all amounts due or to become due on or in respect of
the Aggregate Invested Amount and the Senior Claim (including, without
limitation, any interest thereon accruing after the commencement of any such
proceeding, whether or not any or all of such interest is an allowable claim in
any such proceeding) before BAI is entitled to receive payment on account of
this Subordinated Note, and to that end, any payment or distribution of assets
of Buyer of any kind or character, whether in cash, securities or other
property, in any applicable insolvency proceeding, which would otherwise be
payable to or deliverable upon or with respect to any or all indebtedness under
this Subordinated Note, is hereby assigned to and shall be paid or delivered by

material financing agreements or indentures identified in an officer's

of creditors' rights generally and subject also to the availability of equitable
remedies if equitable remedies are sought.

         (e) In the event that the Receivables Sale Agreement is held to create
a transfer for security purposes rather than a true sale or other outright
assignment, the provisions of the Receivables Sale Agreement are effective to
create valid security interests in favor of the applicable Transferee, in all of
such Seller's right, title and interest, in and to the Receivables and Related
Security described therein which constitute "accounts," "chattel paper" or
"general intangibles" (each as defined in the UCC) (collectively, the "OPINION
COLLATERAL"), as security for the payment of a loan deemed to have been made by

Prices (as defined therein) of the Receivables (as defined therein) sold by such
Seller, together with all other obligations of such Seller thereunder.

         (f) Each of the UCC-1 Financing Statements naming such Seller as
debtor, any Transferee, as secured party, and/or the Administrative Agent, as

Statements in such filing offices and payment of the required filing fees,



                                      -53-
<PAGE>

the security interest in favor of such Transferee in the Opinion Collateral
transferred by such Seller will be perfected and assigned of record to the
Administrative Agent.

         (g) Based solely on our review of the [describe UCC Search
Reports], and assuming (i) the filing of the Financing Statements and payment of
the required filing fees in accordance with paragraph (f) and (ii) the absence
of any intervening filings between the date and time of the Search Reports and
the date and time of the filing of the Financing Statements, the security
interest of Buyer in the Opinion Collateral is prior to any security interest
granted in the Opinion Collateral by such Seller, the priority of which is
determined solely by the filing of a financing statement in the [describe filing
offices].

         (h) To the best of the opinion giver's knowledge, there is no
action, suit or other proceeding against any Seller or any Affiliate of any
Seller, which would materially adversely affect the business or financial
