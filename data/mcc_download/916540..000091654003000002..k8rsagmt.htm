<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This
Employment  Agreement,  dated as of  February 3, 2003,  by and  between  DARLING
INTERNATIONAL INC.,  a Delaware  corporation  ("Employer"  or  "Company")  and
RANDALL C. STUEWE ("Employee").</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Board of Directors of the Company is formulating a long-term  strategic plan for
the Company (the "Strategic Plan"). The Company and Employee agree that (1) such
process may take a period of time which is  difficult to fix at the present time
and (2) pending the completion of such process, Employee should not relocate his
residence  and should  not enter  into a  long-term  employment  contract.  Such
interim period is hereinafter  referred to as the "Interim Term" and the parties
intend that, unless the results of the Strategic Plan would otherwise dictate, a
three year employment period (the "Term") would commence  immediately  following
the Interim Term.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
consideration of the mutual agreements hereinafter set forth, the parties hereto
agree as follows:</P>


<P>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   <U>  Employment  as  Chairman  and  Chief   Executive
Officer.</U> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Employer hereby engages  Employee,  and Employee hereby agrees, to
serve as Employer's  chairman and chief executive  officer during the Employment
Period (as  defined  below),  upon the terms and subject to the  conditions  set
forth in this Agreement.  While serving as chairman and chief executive officer,
Employee  shall carry out such duties as are assigned by the Company's  Board of
Directors  (the  "Board"),  which are  consistent  with  Employee's  position as
chairman and chief  executive  officer,  and shall have full authority to manage
the business of the Company subject to the direction of the Board.</P>


<P>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <U>Director.</U>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Employer  hereby  agrees to  appoint
Employee to a vacant  position on the Board and thereafter to nominate  Employee
for  election to the Board at each  annual  meeting of the  stockholders  of the
Company held during the Employment Period.  Employee hereby agrees to serve as a
director  during the  Employment  Period.  The Board agrees to elect Employee as
Chairman of the Board  immediately  upon  Employee's  appointment  to the Board.
Employer now provides and agrees to use all reasonable  efforts,  to continue to
provide,  at its expense,  directors and officer's  liability  insurance ("D and O")
with  limits of not less than $30  million at all times  during  the  Employment
Period,  provided that if the Board  determines that such "D and O" coverage cannot be
obtained at reasonable  cost,  Employee may elect to  voluntarily  terminate his
employment.</P>


<P>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Base  Salary.</U>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Employee
shall receive a base salary of $400,000 per annum during the  Employment  Period
as compensation for the services contemplated hereby, payable in accordance with
the Employer's payroll policy for senior executive employees ("Base Salary").  A
copy of said policy has been  provided to Employee  prior to  execution  of this
Agreement.  Employer's  Compensation  Committee  will  review  the  Base  Salary
annually on the  anniversary of the  commencement  of the Employment  Period and
increase the Base Salary as appropriate to ensure that  Employee's  compensation
is commensurate with compensation paid to like employees in the industry.  In no
event shall the Base Salary be reduced during the Employment Period.</P>


<P>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Minimum  Employment  Period  and  Extended  Period of
Interim  Term.</U>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  As  indicated  above,  Employer is
unable to precisely  determine  how long the Interim Term will last but it shall
be not less  than  four and not more  than  nine  months  from the date  hereof.
Subject to such minimum and maximum  periods,  the Interim Term shall last until
written notice by Employer to Employee.</P>



<P>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Employment    Period.    </U>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Unless Employer shall have notified  Employee of termination of the Interim Term
and that the Term shall not commence, the Term shall commence
at the end of the Interim  Term and shall  continue for a period of three years,
subject  to (i)  Employer's  right to  terminate  the Term on not less  than six
months notice to Employee,  (ii) extension for successive one-year periods after
expiration of the initial  three-year period of the Term or subsequent  one-year
extensions thereof unless terminated by not less than six months prior notice by
either Employer or Employee and (iii) termination as provided in Section 15. The
term  "Employment  Period"  means all times  Employee is  employed by  Employer,
commencing on the date of this Agreement and continuing  throughout the Term and
any extensions thereof.</P>
