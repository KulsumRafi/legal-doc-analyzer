            3.3 Prepayments. Without the express prior written consent of Senior
Agent, Subordinated Noteholder will not take, demand or receive from any Credit
Party, and no Credit Party will make, give or permit, any prepayment (whether
optional, voluntary, mandatory or otherwise) or other payment (in each case,
whether by redemption, defeasance or other Payment or Distribution), of any
Subordinated Obligation of any kind prior to the scheduled maturity date thereof
or prior to the date on which such payment is required to be made under the
terms of the Subordinated Note Documents, except as otherwise permitted under
clause (iv) of Section 3.1 hereof.

            3.4 Provisions of Section 2 Control. The provisions of this Section
3 shall not be applicable in any case in which the provisions of Section 2
hereof are applicable.

            Section 4. Security Interests; Priorities.

            4.1 Priorities. Each Secured Creditor hereby acknowledges that the
other Secured Creditor has been granted a Lien upon the Shared Collateral to
secure their respective Obligations. The Liens of Senior Agent on the Shared
Collateral, to the extent that such Liens secure the Senior Obligations, have
and shall be senior and prior in right to the Liens of the Subordinated
Noteholders on the Shared Collateral, and such Liens of the Subordinated
Noteholders on the Shared Collateral are and shall be junior and subordinate to
the Liens of Senior Agent, to the extent that such Liens secure the Senior
Obligations. The priorities of the Liens provided in this Section shall not be
altered or otherwise affected by any amendment, modification, supplement,
extension, renewal, restatement, replacement or refinancing of any of the
Obligations. The priorities set forth in this Section are applicable
irrespective of the order or time of attachment, or the order, time or manner of
perfection, or the order or time of filing or recordation of any document or
instrument, or other method of perfecting a Lien in favor of each Secured
Creditor in any Shared Collateral, and notwithstanding any conflicting terms or
conditions which may be contained in any of the Senior Loan Documents or the
Subordinated Note Documents. Each Subordinated Noteholder acknowledges and
agrees that the Senior Creditors have relied upon the lien priority and other
provisions hereof in entering into the Senior Loan Documents and in making funds
available to Borrower thereunder.

            4.2 Perfection. Each Secured Creditor shall be solely responsible
for perfecting and maintaining the perfection of its Lien in and to each item
constituting the Shared Collateral in which such Secured Creditor has been
granted a Lien. The foregoing provisions of this Section 4.2 are intended solely
to govern the respective Lien priorities as between the Secured Creditors and
shall not impose on any Secured Creditor any obligations in respect of the
disposition of proceeds of any Shared Collateral that would conflict with prior
perfected claims therein in favor of any other Person or any order or decree of
any court or governmental authority or any applicable law.


                                       14
<PAGE>
            4.3 Proceeds of Shared Collateral. All proceeds of the Shared
Collateral received by the Subordinated Noteholder shall be forthwith paid over,
in the funds and currency received, to Senior Agent for application to the
Senior Obligations (except as otherwise required by law or court order). All
proceeds of the Shared Collateral received by any Senior Creditor after the
Termination Date shall be forthwith paid over, in the funds and currency
received, to the Subordinated Noteholder for application to the Subordinated
Note Obligations (unless otherwise required by law or court order).

            4.4 Management of Shared Collateral. Subject to the other terms and
conditions of this Section 4.4, the Senior Creditors shall have the exclusive
right to manage, perform and enforce the terms of the Senior Loan Documents with
respect to the Shared Collateral, to exercise and enforce all privileges and
rights thereunder according to their discretion and the exercise of their sole
business judgment, including the exclusive right to take or retake control or
possession of the Shared Collateral and to hold, prepare for sale, process,
sell, lease, dispose of, or liquidate the Shared Collateral and to incur
expenses in connection with such sale or disposition and to exercise all the
rights and remedies of a secured lender under the Uniform Commercial Code of any
applicable jurisdiction. In conducting any public or private sale under the
Uniform Commercial Code, Senior Agent shall give the Subordinated Noteholder
such notice of such sale as may be required by the applicable Uniform Commercial
Code; provided, however, that 10 days' notice shall be deemed to be commercially
reasonable notice. Until the Termination Date, the Subordinated Noteholder may
not exercise remedies against any of the Shared Collateral except for the filing
of proofs of claim in connection with an Insolvency Event.

            4.5 Release of Collateral. The Subordinated Noteholder shall at any
time in connection with any sale, transfer or disposition of the Shared
Collateral permitted by the Senior Creditors or any sale, transfer or other
disposition of any of the Shared Collateral by the Senior Creditors: (i) upon
the request of Senior Agent with respect to the Shared Collateral subject to
such sale, transfer or other disposition, release or otherwise terminate its
Liens on such Shared Collateral; (ii) deliver such terminations of financing
statements, partial lien releases, mortgage satisfactions and discharges,
endorsements, assignments or other instruments of transfer, termination or
release (collectively, "Release Documents") and take such further actions as
Senior Agent shall require in order to release and/or terminate the Subordinated
Noteholder's Liens on any Shared Collateral subject to such sale, transfer or
other disposition. The Subordinated Noteholder shall be deemed to have consented
to any such sale, transfer or other disposition.

            4.6 Power of Attorney. The Subordinated Noteholder hereby
irrevocably constitutes and appoints Senior Agent and any officer of Senior
Agent, with full power of substitution, as its true and lawful attorney-in-fact
with full irrevocable power and authority in the place and stead of the
Subordinated Noteholder and in the


                                       15
<PAGE>
name of such Subordinated Noteholder or in Senior Agent's own name, from time to
time in Senior Agent's discretion, for the purpose of carrying out the terms of
Sections 4.4 and 4.5 hereof, to take any and all appropriate action and to
execute any and all documents and instruments which may be necessary or
desirable to accomplish the purposes of such Sections, including any Release
Documents, and, in addition, to take any and all other appropriate and
commercially reasonable action for the purpose of carrying out the terms of such
Sections. The Subordinated Noteholder hereby ratifies all that said attorneys
shall lawfully do or cause to be done pursuant to the power of attorney granted
in this Section 4.6. No Person to whom this power of attorney is presented, as
authority for Senior Agent to take any action or actions contemplated hereby,
shall be required to inquire into or seek confirmation from the Subordinated
Noteholder as to the authority of Senior Agent to take any action described
herein, or as to the existence of or fulfillment of any condition to this power
of attorney, which is intended to grant to Senior Agent unconditionally the
authority to take and perform the actions contemplated herein. The Subordinated
Noteholder irrevocably waives any right to commence any suit or action, in law
or equity, against any Person which acts in reliance upon or acknowledges the
authority granted under this power of attorney.

            4.7 Waiver of Marshalling and Similar Rights. The Subordinated
Noteholder, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, waives any
requirement regarding, and agrees not to demand, request, plead or otherwise
claim the benefit of, any marshalling, appraisement, valuation or other similar
right that may otherwise be available under applicable law. The Subordinated
Noteholder waives any and all notice of the creation, renewal, extension of
accrual of any of the Obligations under the Senior Loan Documents and notice of
or proof of reliance by the Senior Creditors upon this Agreement and protest,
demand for payment or notice except to the extent otherwise specified herein.
The Subordinated Noteholder acknowledges and agrees that the Senior Creditors
have relied upon the lien priority and other provisions hereof in entering into
the Senior Loan Documents and in making funds available to the Borrower
thereunder.

            4.8 Notice of Interest In Collateral. This Agreement is intended, in
part, to constitute an authenticated notification of a claim by Senior Agent to
the Subordinated Noteholder of an interest in the Collateral in accordance with
the provisions of Sections 9-611 and 9-621 of the Uniform Commercial Code.

            Section 5. Consent; Waivers; Other Matters.

            5.1 Consent to Amendments, etc. Subordinated Noteholder consents
that, without the necessity of any reservation of rights against it, and without
notice to or further assent by Subordinated Noteholder:

            (a) any demand for payment of any Senior Obligations made by Senior
Creditors may be rescinded in whole or in part by Senior Creditors, and the
Senior Obligations, or the liability of any Credit Party or any other party upon
or for any part thereof, or any collateral security, including any Shared
Collateral, or guarantee therefor


                                       16
<PAGE>
      or right of offset with respect thereto, or any obligation or liability of
      any Credit Party or any other party under the Senior Loan Documents or any
      other agreement, may, from time to time, in whole or in part, be
      increased, continued, renewed, extended, modified, accelerated,
      compromised, waived, surrendered, or released by Senior Creditors; and

            (b) any Senior Loan Document may be amended, modified, supplemented,
terminated or waived, in whole or in part, as Senior Creditors may deem
advisable from time to time, and any collateral security, including any Shared
Collateral, at any time held by Senior Creditors for the payment of any of the
Senior Obligations may be sold, exchanged, waived, surrendered or released, in
each case all without notice to or further assent by Subordinated Noteholder,
which will remain bound under this Agreement, and all without impairing,
abridging, releasing or affecting the subordination and other provisions hereof.

            5.2 Reliance by Senior Creditors. Subordinated Noteholder
acknowledges and agrees that Senior Creditors have relied upon the subordination
and other provisions hereof in entering into the Senior Loan Documents and in
making Senior Loans available to the Credit Parties thereunder. Subordinated
Noteholder waives any and all notice of the creation, renewal, increase,
extension or accrual of any of the Senior Obligations and notice of or proof of
reliance by Senior Creditors upon this Agreement. The Senior Obligations, and
any of them, shall be deemed conclusively to have been created, contracted or
incurred in reliance upon this Agreement, and all dealings between the Credit
Parties and Senior Creditors shall be deemed to have been consummated in
reliance upon this Agreement.

            5.3 No Representation by Senior Creditors. Except as provided in
Section 6.2 hereof, Senior Creditors have not made and do not hereby or
otherwise make to Subordinated Noteholder, any representations or warranties,
express, or implied, nor do Senior Creditors assume any liability to
Subordinated Noteholder with respect to: (a) the financial or other condition of
the Credit Parties or any other obligors under any instruments of guarantee, if
any, with respect to the Senior Obligations, (b) the enforceability, validity,
value or collectibility of the Senior Obligations or the Subordinated
Obligations, any collateral therefor, or any guarantee or security which may
have been granted in connection with any of the Senior Obligations or the
Subordinated Obligations or the validity, priority or perfections of any Liens,
or (c) any Credit Party's title or right to any property or assets or to
transfer any collateral or security.

            5.4 No Waiver of Subordination Provisions. No right of any Senior
Creditor to enforce the subordination provisions of this Agreement shall at any
time in any way be prejudiced or impaired by any act or failure to act on the
part of any Credit Party or by any act or failure to act by any Senior Creditor,
or by an noncompliance by any Person with the terms, provisions and covenants of
this Agreement or any of the Senior Loan Documents, regardless of any knowledge
thereof which any Senior Creditor may have or be otherwise charged with.


                                       17
<PAGE>
            5.5 Waivers. Subordinated Noteholder hereby agrees that (i) Senior
Creditors may exercise remedies against all or part of any collateral, including
any Shared Collateral, it holds as security for the Senior Obligations in such
order as Senior Creditors, in their sole discretion, elect and (ii) any proceeds
of such collateral received by Senior Creditors may be applied, reversed, and
reapplied, in whole or in part, to any of the Senior Obligations, as Senior
Creditors, in their sole discretion, deem appropriate. Subordinated Noteholder
agrees not to assert and hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law,
any right to demand, request, plead or otherwise assert or otherwise claim the
benefit of, any marshaling, appraisement, valuation or other similar right of a
creditor that may otherwise be available under applicable law or any right to
receive notice of Senior Creditors' intended disposition of such collateral (or
a portion thereof) or of Senior Creditors' proposed retention of such collateral
in satisfaction of the Senior Obligations (or a portion thereof). Neither Senior
Creditors nor any of their respective directors, officers, employees or agents
shall be liable for failure to demand, collect or realize upon any of such
collateral or for any delay in doing so or shall be under any obligation to sell
or otherwise dispose of any such collateral upon the request of any Credit Party
or Subordinated Noteholder or any other Person or to take any other action
whatsoever with regard to any such collateral or any part thereof. To the
maximum extent permitted by law, Subordinated Noteholder hereby waives, releases
and discharges any and all rights, claims, causes of action, liabilities, claims
and demands, in law or equity, which Subordinated Noteholder has had, now has,
or may in the future have, against Senior Creditors with respect to, or arising
out of, any action or failure to act or any error of judgment, negligence, or
mistake or oversight whatsoever on the part of Senior Creditors or their
directors, officers, employees or agents with respect to any exercise of rights
or remedies or other action or failure to act under or in connection with the
Senior Loan Documents or any other documents or in an effort to collect in
respect of the Senior Obligations.

            5.6 Amendments to Subordinated Loan Documents; Waiver of Covenants.
Without the prior written consent of Senior Agent, no Subordinated Loan Document
shall be amended, modified, waived or supplemented. The Subordinated Noteholder
hereby until the Termination Date waives compliance by each Credit Party with
all of the covenants, terms and other provisions of the Subordinated Note
Documents, other than obligations thereunder with respect to the payment of the
Subordinated Obligations, and any default or event of default that may arise by
reason of the failure to comply with any such covenants, terms and other
provisions of the Subordinated Note Documents.

            5.7 Subrogation. On and after the Termination Date, Subordinated
Noteholder shall be subrogated to the rights of Senior Creditors to receive
payments or distributions of assets of the Credit Parties in respect of the
Senior Obligations until the Senior Obligations shall be paid in full. For the
purposes of such subrogation, no Payments or Distributions to Senior Creditors
to which Subordinated Noteholder would be entitled except for the provisions of
this Agreement shall be deemed, as between the


                                       18
<PAGE>
Credit Parties and their creditors other than Senior Creditors and Subordinated
Noteholder, to be a payment by the Credit Parties to or on account of the Senior
Obligations, it being understood that the provisions of this Agreement are, and
are intended solely, for the purpose of defining the relative rights of
Subordinated Noteholder, on the one hand, and Senior Creditors, on the other
hand.

Obligations, other than a second priority security interest on the Shared
Collateral pursuant to the Subordinated Note Documents to secure the
Subordinated Secured Notes;

            (b) permit the Distribution Agreement to be amended, modified,
waived or supplemented, and notwithstanding any provision in the Distribution
Agreement to the contrary or any right under applicable law or otherwise, no
Subordinated Noteholder or any affiliate thereof shall, or shall have any right
to, revoke, terminate or cancel, the Distribution Agreement in any respect; or

            (c) commence or join with any creditors other than Senior Creditors
in commencing any proceeding referred to in the definition of "Insolvency
Event".

            6.4 License to Use Intellectual Property. For the purpose of
enabling Senior Agent to exercise rights and remedies under the Loan Documents
(including, in order to take possession of, hold, preserve, process, assemble,
prepare for sale, market for sale, sell or otherwise dispose of any collateral,
including any Shared Collateral) at such time as Senior Agent shall be lawfully
entitled to exercise such rights and remedies, the Subordinated Noteholder
hereby grants to Senior Agent, for the benefit of Senior Agent and Lenders, an
irrevocable, nonexclusive license (exercisable without payment of royalty or
other compensation by Agent and Lenders to the Subordinated Noteholder,
provided, that nothing in this Section 6.4 shall impair the obligation of any
Credit Party to Parent for payment of royalties and other compensation under the
Distribution Agreement, which such payments shall continue to accrue and be
payable to Parent by such Credit Party) to use, license or sublicense any
Intellectual Property now owned or hereafter acquired by the Subordinated
Noteholder, and wherever the same may be located, and including in such license
access to all media in which any of the licensed items may be recorded or stored
and to all computer software and programs used for the compilation or printout
thereof. The Subordinated Noteholder hereby consents to the grant by the
Borrower to the Senior Creditors of a security interest in Borrower's right,
title and interests under the Distribution Agreement, and consents to any sale,
assignment or other transfer by the Senior Creditors of Borrower's right, title
and interests under the Distribution Agreement in connection with any exercise
of rights and remedies by the Senior Creditors under the Senior Loan Documents.
Nothing in this Agreement shall impair or limit the Subordinated Noteholder's
ownership rights with respect to any of its intellectual property, other than
the license granted to Senior Agent pursuant to this Section 6.4.

            Section 7. Bankruptcy Matters.

            7.1 Bankruptcy. The provisions of this Agreement shall continue in
full force and effect notwithstanding the occurrence of any Insolvency Event.
Subordinated Noteholder agrees that Senior Creditors may consent to the use of
cash collateral or provide financing to any Credit Party on such terms and
conditions and in such amounts as Senior Creditors, in their sole discretion,
may decide and that Subordinated Noteholder shall not contest or oppose in any
manner, such cash collateral use or such financing, and further that in
connection with such cash collateral use or financing any Credit Party (or a
trustee appointed for the estate of any Credit Party) may grant to Senior
Creditors Liens upon all or any part of the assets of such Credit Party, which
Liens (i) shall secure payments of all Senior Obligations (whether such Senior
Obligations arose prior to the filing of the petition for relief or arise
thereafter); and (ii) shall be superior in priority to the Liens on the assets
of such Credit Party held by any other Person. All allocations of payments
between Senior Creditors and Subordinated Noteholder shall, subject to any court
order, continue to be made after the filing of a petition under the United
States Bankruptcy Code, as amended (the "Bankruptcy Code"), or any similar
proceeding on the same basis that the payments were to be allocated prior to the
date of such filing. Subordinated Noteholder agrees that it will not object to
or oppose a sale or other disposition of any assets securing the Senior
Obligations (or any portion thereof) free and clear of Liens or other claims
under Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code or any other provision of the
Bankruptcy Code if Senior Creditors have consented to such sale or disposition
of such assets. In the event that Subordinated Noteholder has or at any time
acquires any security for the Subordinated Obligations, Subordinated Noteholder
agrees not to assert any right it may have to "adequate protection" of its
interest in such security in any bankruptcy proceeding and agrees that it will
not seek to have the automatic stay lifted with respect to such security,
without the prior written consent of Senior Creditors. Subordinated Noteholder
waives any claim it may now or hereafter have arising out of Senior Creditors'
election, in any proceeding instituted under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code,
of the application of Section 1111(b)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code, and/or any
borrowing or grant of a security interest under Section 364 of the Bankruptcy
Code by any Credit Party, as debtor in possession. Subordinated Noteholder (both
in its capacity as Subordinated Noteholder and in its capacity as a party which
may be obligated to the Credit Parties and their respective Affiliates with
respect to contracts which are part of the Senior Creditors' collateral) agrees
not to initiate or prosecute or encourage any other Person to initiate or
prosecute any claim, action or other proceeding (i) challenging the
enforceability of Senior Creditors' claim or oppose any action by Senior
Creditors to enforce their rights or remedies relating to the Senior
Obligations, (ii) challenging the enforceability, validity, priority or
perfected status of any Liens on assets securing the Senior Obligations or (iii)
asserting any claims which the Credit Parties may hold with respect to Senior
Creditors.

            7.2 Invalidated Payments. To the extent that Senior Creditors
receive payments on, or proceeds of collateral for, the Senior Obligations which
are subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set
aside and/or required to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party
under any bankruptcy law, state or federal law, common law, or equitable cause,
then to the extent of such payment or proceeds received, the Senior Obligations,
or part thereof, intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continue in full
force and effect as if such payments or proceeds had not been received by Senior
Creditors.

            7.3 Proof of Claims. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance
of any Insolvency Event:

            (a) Subordinated Noteholder irrevocably authorizes and empowers
Senior Creditors (A) to demand, sue for, collect and receive for and on behalf
of Subordinated Noteholder every Payment or Distribution on account of the
Subordinated Obligations payable or deliverable in connection with such
Insolvency Event and give acquittance therefor, and (B) if proper proof of claim
and other pleadings and motions are not filed by Subordinated Noteholder at
least 30 days prior to the bar date for such filings, to file claims and proofs
of claim in any statutory or non-statutory proceeding against the Credit Parties
on account of the Subordinated Obligations and to vote such proofs of claim in
any such proceeding and take such other actions, in its own name as Senior
Creditors, or in the name of Subordinated Noteholder or otherwise, as Senior
Creditors may deem necessary or advisable for the enforcement of the provisions
of this Agreement; provided, however, that the foregoing authorization and
empowerment imposes no obligation on Senior Creditors to take any such action
and that, in voting such proofs of claim in any such proceeding, Senior
Creditors may act in a manner consistent with their own interests and shall have
no duty to take any action to optimize or maximize Subordinated Noteholder's
recovery with respect to its claim;

            (b) Subordinated Noteholder shall take such action, duly and
promptly, as Senior Agent may request from time to time (A) to demand, sue for,
collect and receive the Subordinated Obligations for the account of Senior
Creditors and (B) to file appropriate proofs of claim and other pleadings and
motions in respect of the Subordinated Obligations; and

            (c) Subordinated Noteholder shall execute and deliver such powers of
attorney, assignments or proofs of claim or other instruments as Senior Agent
may request to enable Senior Creditors to enforce any and all claims in respect
of the Subordinated Obligations and to collect and receive any and all payments
and distributions which may be payable or deliverable at any time upon or in
respect of the Subordinated Obligations.

Subordinated Obligations in accordance with the terms hereof and (ii) the

Creditors may continue, at any time and without notice to Subordinated

Noteholder and Senior Creditors hereby waive any right they may have under
applicable law to revoke this Agreement or any of the provisions of this
Agreement.

            8.2 Further Assurances. Subordinated Noteholder and each Credit
Party, at its own expense and at any time from time to time, upon the written
request of Senior Agent will promptly and duly execute and deliver such further
instruments and documents and take such further actions as Senior Agent
reasonably may request for the purposes of obtaining or preserving the full
benefits of this Agreement and of the rights and powers herein granted. The
Subordinated Noteholder will pay, indemnify and hold each Senior Creditor
harmless from and against any and all liabilities, obligations damages,
penalties, actions (whether sounding in tort, contract or on any other ground),
judgments, suits, costs, expenses and disbursements of any kind or nature
whatsoever arising out of or relating to a breach by the Subordinated Noteholder
of any of its obligations under this Agreement.

            8.3 Provisions Define Relative Rights. This Agreement is intended

of any other right, power or privilege.

            (c) The rights and remedies herein provided are cumulative, may be
exercised singly or concurrently and are not exclusive of any other rights or
remedies provided by law.

            8.12 Section Headings. The section headings used in this Agreement
are for convenience of reference only and are not to affect the construction
hereof or be taken into consideration in the interpretation hereof.

            8.13 Successors and Assigns; Refinancing of Senior Obligations. This
Agreement shall be binding upon Subordinated Noteholder and the Credit Parties
and their respective successors and assigns and shall inure to the benefit of
Senior Creditors and their successors and assigns. Neither Subordinated

obligations hereunder, except to the extent permitted with respect to the
Subordinated Noteholder by the immediately succeeding sentence of this Section
8.13. Subordinated Noteholder shall not, without the prior written consent of
Senior Agent, sell, assign, or otherwise transfer, in whole or in part, the
Subordinated Obligations to any other Person (a "Transferee") or create, incur

favor of any Transferee unless (1) such action is made expressly subject to this
Agreement and (2) the Transferee expressly acknowledges to Senior Agent, by a
writing in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Senior Agent, the
subordination provided for herein and agrees to be bound by all of the terms
hereof. In the event that any Person ("Refinancing Senior Lenders") at any time
hereafter extends credit to any Credit Party and the proceeds of such extension
of credit are applied to the repayment of all or a substantial part of the
Senior Obligations then all indebtedness and liabilities of the Credit Parties
to the Refinancing Senior Lenders and the Refinancing Senior Lenders shall be
entitled to the benefits of this Agreement to the same extent as the Senior
Obligations and Senior Creditors, and Subordinated Noteholder and the Credit
Parties shall promptly execute and deliver any agreement which the Refinancing
Senior Lenders shall reasonably request with respect thereto confirming the
terms and conditions of this Agreement in favor of the Refinancing Senior
Lenders.

            8.14 Senior Obligations Unconditional. All rights and interests of
Senior Creditors hereunder, and all agreements and obligations of Subordinated
Noteholder and the Credit Parties hereunder, shall be absolute and irreversible
notwithstanding (a) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Senior Loan
Document; (b) any change in time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other
term of, all or any of the Senior Obligations, any increase in the amount of the
Senior Obligations, or any amendment or waiver or other modification, whether by
course of conduct or otherwise, of the terms of any Senior Loan Document; (c)
any exchange, release or nonperfection of any security interest in any
collateral, including any Shared Collateral, or any release, amendment, waiver
or other modification, whether in writing or by course of conduct or otherwise,
of all or any of the Senior Obligations or any guarantee thereof; or (d) any
other circumstances which otherwise might constitute a defense available to, or
a discharge of, any Credit Party in respect of the Senior Obligations, or of
Subordinated Noteholder or any Credit Party in respect of this Agreement.

            8.15 GOVERNING LAW; CONSENT TO JURISDICTION AND VENUE. THIS
AGREEMENT AND THE OBLIGATIONS ARISING HEREUNDER SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND
CONSTRUED AND ENFORCED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK
APPLICABLE TO CONTRACTS MADE AND PERFORMED IN SUCH STATE, AND ANY APPLICABLE
LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY CONSENTS
AND AGREES THAT THE STATE OR FEDERAL COURTS LOCATED IN NEW YORK CITY SHALL HAVE
EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION TO HEAR AND DETERMINE ANY CLAIMS OR DISPUTES AMONG THE
PARTIES HERETO PERTAINING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR TO ANY MATTER ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, PROVIDED, THAT THE PARTIES HERETO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT
ANY APPEALS FROM THOSE COURTS MAY HAVE TO BE HEARD BY A COURT LOCATED OUTSIDE OF
NEW YORK CITY AND, PROVIDED, FURTHER, THAT NOTHING IN THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE
DEEMED OR OPERATE TO PRECLUDE SENIOR CREDITORS FROM BRINGING SUIT OR TAKING
OTHER LEGAL ACTION IN ANY OTHER JURISDICTION TO REALIZE ON ANY SECURITY FOR THE
SENIOR OBLIGATIONS, OR TO ENFORCE A JUDGMENT OR OTHER COURT ORDER IN FAVOR OF
ANY SENIOR CREDITOR. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO EXPRESSLY SUBMITS AND CONSENTS
IN ADVANCE TO SUCH JURISDICTION IN ANY ACTION OR SUIT COMMENCED IN ANY SUCH
COURT, AND EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY WAIVES ANY OBJECTION WHICH IT MAY
HAVE BASED UPON LACK OF PERSONAL JURISDICTION, IMPROPER VENUE OR FORUM NON
CONVENIENS. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY WAIVES PERSONAL SERVICE OF THE
SUMMONS, COMPLAINT AND OTHER PROCESS ISSUED IN ANY SUCH ACTION OR SUIT AND
AGREES THAT SERVICE OF SUCH SUMMONS, COMPLAINT AND OTHER PROCESS MAY BE MADE BY
REGISTERED OR CERTIFIED MAIL ADDRESSED TO IT AT THE ADDRESS SET FORTH HEREIN,


                                       26
<PAGE>
AND THAT SERVICE SO MADE SHALL BE DEEMED COMPLETED UPON THE EARLIER OF SUCH
PARTY'S ACTUAL RECEIPT THEREOF OR THREE BUSINESS (3) DAYS AFTER DEPOSIT IN THE
U.S. MAILS, PROPER POSTAGE PREPAID.

            8.16 MUTUAL WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. BECAUSE DISPUTES ARISING IN
CONNECTION WITH COMPLEX FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS ARE MOST QUICKLY AND ECONOMICALLY
RESOLVED BY AN EXPERIENCED AND EXPERT PERSON AND THE PARTIES WISH APPLICABLE
STATE AND FEDERAL LAWS TO APPLY (RATHER THAN ARBITRATION RULES), THE PARTIES
DESIRE THAT THEIR DISPUTES BE RESOLVED BY A JUDGE APPLYING SUCH APPLICABLE LAWS.
THEREFORE, TO ACHIEVE THE BEST COMBINATION OF THE BENEFITS OF THE JUDICIAL
SYSTEM AND OF ARBITRATION, THE PARTIES HERETO WAIVE ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY
IN ANY ACTION, SUIT, OR PROCEEDING BROUGHT TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE, WHETHER
SOUNDING IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, BETWEEN THE PARTIES ARISING OUT OF,
CONNECTED WITH, RELATED TO, OR INCIDENTAL TO THE RELATIONSHIP ESTABLISHED
BETWEEN THEM IN CONNECTION WITH, THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS RELATED
THERETO.

            8.17 No Parent Funding Obligations. The parties acknowledge by their
signature below that nothing contained in this Agreement shall constitute a
commitment or obligation of Parent to fund the ongoing working capital needs of
the Credit Parties, including, without limitation, extending additional
financing under the Subordinated Credit Agreement or the Subordinated Notes
beyond the amounts outstanding thereunder on the date hereof.
