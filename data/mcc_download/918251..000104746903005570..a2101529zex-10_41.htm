<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;Pledgor's
chief executive office is located, in the state specified on the signature page hereof. In addition, Pledgor is incorporated in or organized under the laws of
the state specified on such signature page. Pledgor shall give Bank at least thirty (30)&nbsp;days notice before changing its residence or its chief executive office or state of incorporation or
organization. The Pledgor will notify the Bank in writing prior to any change in the location of any Collateral, including the Books and Records. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;The

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless

repairs, rent, storage costs and expenses of sales, and any costs to perfect the Bank's security interest. Without waiving the Pledgor's default for failure to make any such payment, the Bank at its
option may pay any such costs and expenses, discharge encumbrances on the Collateral, and pay for insurance of the Collateral, and such payments shall be a part of the Indebtedness and bear interest
at the rate set out in the Indebtedness. The Pledgor agrees to reimburse the Bank on demand for any costs so incurred. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g)&nbsp;&nbsp;Until
the Bank exercises its rights to make collection, the Pledgor will diligently collect all Collateral. </FONT></P>

can be so insured. Such insurance shall require losses to be paid on a replacement cost basis, be issued by insurance companies acceptable to the Bank and include a loss payable endorsement in favor
of the Bank in a form acceptable to the Bank. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;At
the request of the Pledgor or the Bank, any Claim shall be resolved by binding arbitration in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act (Title 9, U. S. Code) (the

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;Arbitration
proceedings will be determined in accordance with the Act, the applicable rules and procedures for the arbitration of disputes of JAMS or any successor

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;The
arbitration shall be administered by JAMS and conducted in any U.S. state where any tangible personal property collateral covered by this security agreement is
located, or if there is no such collateral, in California. All Claims shall be determined by one arbitrator; however, if Claims exceed Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000), upon the request of any party,
the Claims shall be decided by three arbitrators. All arbitration hearings shall commence within ninety (90)&nbsp;days of the demand for arbitration and close within ninety (90)&nbsp;days of
commencement and the award of the arbitrator(s) shall be issued within thirty (30)&nbsp;days of the close of the hearing. However, the arbitrator(s), upon a showing of good cause, may extend the
commencement of the hearing for up to an additional sixty (60)&nbsp;days. The arbitrator(s) shall provide a concise written statement of reasons for the award. The arbitration award may be submitted
to any court having jurisdiction to be confirmed and enforced. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;The
