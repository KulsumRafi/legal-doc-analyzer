Date; All Taxes levied with respect to the Acquired Assets or the Business for a
taxable period which includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date shall be
apportioned between Buyer and Seller based on the number of days included in
such period through and including the Closing Date, in the case of Taxes to be
paid by the Seller, and the number of days included in such period after the
Closing Date, in the case of Taxes to be paid by the Buyer (the "APPORTIONED
TAXES"). If either party receives any notice indicating that any such
Apportioned Taxes are due, then it shall present that notice to the other party
together with a statement setting forth the amount of such Apportioned Taxes
actually attributable to the pre-Closing and post-Closing periods together with
such supporting evidence as is reasonably necessary and available to calculate
such amount. The applicable party shall promptly discharge and pay any such
Apportioned Taxes for which it is responsible.

     1.3  POST CLOSING PURCHASE PRICE ADJUSTMENT AND EARN-OUT PAYMENT.

          (a) Post Closing Purchase Price Adjustment

               (i) Within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, the Buyer will
prepare and deliver to the Seller an audited special purpose statement of the
assets and liabilities of the Business as of the close of business on the
Closing Date, which shall include line items for "Inventory (net)", "Equipment
(net)", "Warranty Accrual", and "Deferred Revenue" (the "CLOSING NET ASSETS
STATEMENT"). The date on which the Closing Net Assets Statement is delivered to
the Seller is referred to herein as the "NET ASSETS DELIVERY DATE". The Closing
Net Assets Statement will be prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles ("GAAP"). The amount of assets shown on the Closing Net
Assets Statement minus the amount of liabilities shown on the Closing Net Assets
Statement is referred to herein as "NET ASSETS". The Buyer will retain
PricewaterhouseCoopers to review and prepare the Closing Net Assets Statement
and to render its audited report thereon stating that the Closing Net Assets
Statement has been prepared in accordance with the terms of this SECTION
1.3(a)(i). Such report of PricewaterhouseCoopers will be delivered to the Seller
together with the Closing Net Assets Statement. The Seller will, upon reasonable
request of the Buyer, cause its employees and representatives to assist the
Buyer and its representatives in the preparation of the Closing Net Assets
Statement and to assist PricewaterhouseCoopers in connection with its review and
preparation of the Closing Net Assets Statement and its issuance of the audited
report thereon; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that such assistance will not unreasonably
interfere with the normal work duties of such employees. The Seller will cause
the Buyer, the Buyer's representatives and PricewaterhouseCoopers to be provided
with access at all reasonable times, following reasonable notice, to the
properties, books and records of the Seller related to the Business for such
purposes; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that such access will not unreasonably interfere
with the normal work duties of the employees of the Seller. The Buyer and the
Seller shall each pay one-half (1/2) of all fees and costs charged by
PricewaterhouseCoopers necessary to prepare the Closing Net Assets Statement.

               (ii) The Closing Net Assets Statement will be deemed to be the
final, binding and conclusive Closing Net Assets Statement (the "FINAL CLOSING
NET ASSETS STATEMENT") for all purposes at, and at all times after, the close of
business on the thirtieth (30th) day after the Net Assets Delivery Date unless
the Seller delivers to the Buyer written notice of its disagreement (a "NET
ASSETS NOTICE OF DISAGREEMENT") prior to the close of business on the thirtieth
(30th) day after the Net Assets Delivery Date specifying in reasonable detail
the nature of the Seller's objections to the Closing Net Assets Statement. To be
assertable in a Net Assets Notice of Disagreement, an objection by the Seller
with respect to any individual item on the Closing Net Assets Statement must
assert that the Closing Net Assets Statement was not prepared in accordance with
the terms of SECTION 1.3(a)(i) with respect to such item and relate to an
adjustment equal to or greater than Twenty Five Thousand U.S. Dollars ($25,000).
The Seller hereby waives the right to assert any objection to the Closing Net
Assets Statement that is not asserted in a Net Assets Notice of Disagreement
delivered by the Seller to the Buyer prior to the close of business on the
thirtieth (30th) day after the Net Assets Delivery Date. If a Net Assets Notice
of Disagreement is delivered by the Seller to the Buyer within such thirty (30)
day period, then the Closing Net Assets Statement (as adjusted, if necessary)
will be deemed to be the Final Closing Net Assets Statement for all purposes on
the earlier of (x) the date the Buyer and the


                                      -7-
<PAGE>

Seller resolve in writing all differences they have with respect to the Closing
Net Assets Statement, or (y) the date the disputed matters are resolved in
writing by the Unaffiliated Firm (as defined below). In the event that disputed
matters are resolved by the Unaffiliated Firm (as set forth below in accordance
with the terms hereof), the Final Closing Net Assets Statement will consist of
the applicable amounts from the Closing Net Assets Statement (or amounts
otherwise agreed to in writing by the Buyer and the Seller) as to items that
have not been submitted for resolution to the Unaffiliated Firm, and the amounts
determined by the Unaffiliated Firm as to items that were submitted for
resolution by the Unaffiliated Firm.

               (iii) During the twenty (20) day period following the delivery of
a Net Assets Notice of Disagreement (the "NET ASSETS RESOLUTION PERIOD"), the
Buyer and the Seller will seek in good faith to resolve any differences they may
have with respect to matters specified in the Net Assets Notice of Disagreement.
If, at the end of the Net Assets Resolution Period, the Buyer and the Seller
have not reached agreement on such matters, the Buyer and the Seller will
jointly engage a single arbitrator from the firm of Ernst & Young, LLP (or, if a
representative of such firm is unable or unwilling to act in such capacity, a
single arbitrator from the firm of KPMG, LLP) (the "UNAFFILIATED FIRM") to
resolve all matters which remain in dispute with respect to the Closing Net
Assets Statement by arbitration in accordance with the procedures set forth in
this SECTION 1.3(a)(iii). In connection with such engagement, each of the Buyer
and the Seller agrees to execute, if requested by the Unaffiliated Firm, an
engagement letter on terms reasonably satisfactory to each of the Buyer and the
Seller including customary indemnities. Each of the Buyer and the Seller may
submit in writing to the Unaffiliated Firm a position statement together with
any applicable supporting documentation it desires (each, a "NET ASSETS POSITION
STATEMENT") with respect to each of the Buyer's proposed adjustments that remain
in dispute following the Net Assets Resolution Period. Net Assets Position
Statements, if any, shall be delivered to the Unaffiliated Firm, with a copy to
the other Party hereto (at the same time as it is provided to the Unaffiliated
Firm), no later than the later of (x) the third (3rd) Business Day (as such term
is hereinafter defined) following the date the Unaffiliated Firm accepts its
engagement hereunder, or (y) the thirtieth (30th) day following the end of the
Net Assets Resolution Period. For purposes of this Agreement a "BUSINESS DAY"
shall be any day other than (i) a Saturday or Sunday, or (ii) a day on which
banking institutions located in New York, New York are permitted or required by
law, executive order or governmental decree to remain closed. Promptly after
such engagement of the Unaffiliated Firm, the Buyer or the Seller will provide
the Unaffiliated Firm with a copy of this Agreement, the Closing Net Assets
Statement, the Net Assets Notice of Disagreement and, if applicable, the Net
Assets Position Statements. The Unaffiliated Firm will have the authority to
request in writing such additional written submissions from either the Buyer or
the Seller as it deems appropriate; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that a copy of any such
submission will be provided to the other Party at the same time as it is
provided to the Unaffiliated Firm. Neither Party will make (or permit any of its
parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, employees or representatives to make) any
additional submission to the Unaffiliated Firm except pursuant to such a written
request by the Unaffiliated Firm. Neither Party will communicate (or permit any
of its parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, employees or representatives to
communicate) with the Unaffiliated Firm without providing the other Party a
reasonable opportunity to participate in such communication with the
Unaffiliated Firm (other than with respect to written submissions in response to
the written request of the Unaffiliated Firm). The Unaffiliated Firm will have
thirty (30) days to review the documents provided to it


                                      -8-

<PAGE>

pursuant to this SECTION 1.3(a)(iii). Within such thirty (30) day period, the
Unaffiliated Firm will furnish simultaneously to both parties its written
determination with respect to each of the adjustments in dispute submitted to it
for resolution. The Unaffiliated Firm will resolve the differences regarding the
Closing Net Assets Statement based solely on the information provided to the
Unaffiliated Firm by the Buyer and the Seller pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement (and not independent review). The Unaffiliated Firm's authority will
be limited to resolving disputes with respect to whether the Closing Net Assets
Statement was prepared in accordance with SECTION 1.3(a)(i) with respect to the
individual items on the Closing Net Assets Statement in dispute (it being
understood that the Unaffiliated Firm will have no authority to make any
adjustments to any financial statements or amounts other than amounts set forth
in the Closing Net Assets Statement that are in dispute). In resolving any
disputed item, the Unaffiliated Firm may not assign a value to such item greater
than the greatest value for such item asserted by either Party or less than the
smallest value for such item asserted by either Party.

               (iv) The decision of the Unaffiliated Firm will be, for all
purposes, conclusive, non-appealable, final and binding upon the Seller, the
Buyer and each of their parents, subsidiaries or affiliates. Such decision will
be subject to specific performance pursuant to SECTION 7.10, and judgment may
also be entered thereon as an arbitration award pursuant to the Federal
Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. ss.ss. 1-16, in any court of competent jurisdiction
specified in SECTION 7.12. The fees of the Unaffiliated Firm will be borne
equally by the Buyer and the Seller. Unless otherwise set forth herein, each
Party will bear the fees, costs and expenses of its own accountants and all of
its other expenses in connection with matters contemplated by this SECTION
1.3(a).

               (v) (A)  Upon the Closing Net Assets Statement being deemed the
Final Closing Net Assets Statement in accordance with SECTION 1.3(a), the
Purchase Price will be adjusted, up or down, as follows:

                      (I) if the amount of Net Assets shown on the Final Closing
Net Assets Statement (the "NET ASSET AMOUNT") is less than One Million Three
Hundred Thousand U.S. Dollars ($1,300,000) (the "BASELINE AMOUNT"), the Purchase
Price will be reduced by the amount by which the Net Asset Amount is less than
the Baseline Amount and such amount by which the Purchase Price is reduced will
be paid by the Seller to the Buyer or drawn from the amounts deposited pursuant
to the Escrow Agreement (without a replenishment of such amounts held in escrow)
in accordance with SECTION 1.3(a)(v)(b) below; and

                      (II) if the Net Asset Amount is greater than the Baseline
Amount, the Purchase Price will be increased by the amount by which the Net
Asset Amount is greater than the Baseline Amount and such amount by which the
Purchase Price is increased will be paid by the Buyer to the Seller within three
(3) Business Days after the Closing Net Assets Statement is deemed the Final
Closing Net Assets Statement in accordance with SECTION 1.3(a).

                   (B) Any payment required under SECTION 1.3(a)(v) will bear
interest from the later of the Net Assets Delivery Date or delivery date of the
Net Assets Notice of Disagreement to the date of payment (calculated based on
actual days elapsed in a three hundred sixty-five (365) day year) at a rate per
annum equal to the six (6) month LIBOR rate published in the Wall Street
Journal, Eastern Edition, on the Closing Date. Any such payment


                                      -9-
<PAGE>

will be made (together with such interest), by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to a bank account designated by the Buyer or the Seller, as the
case may be, within three (3) Business Days after the date that the Closing Net
Assets Statement is deemed to be the Final Closing Net Assets Statement in
accordance with SECTION 1.3(a)(v). In the event the Seller is required to make a
payment to the Buyer under this SECTION 1.3(a)(v), the Buyer may give notice of
such amount under the Escrow Agreement and cause the escrow agent thereunder to
pay over such amounts to Buyer, and Seller shall not object thereto. Giving such
notice under the Escrow Agreement will not constitute an election of remedies or
limit the Buyer in any manner in the enforcement of any remedies available to
it.

          (b) Earn-Out Payment

               (i) No later than March 1, 2004, the Buyer will prepare and
deliver to the Seller a statement identifying all of the Business Net Revenues
(as defined below) for the period commencing on February 1, 2003 and ending on
December 31, 2003 (the "BUSINESS NET REVENUES STATEMENT"). The date on which the
Business Net Revenues Statement is delivered to the Seller is referred to herein
as the "NET REVENUES DELIVERY DATE". The Business Net Revenues Statement shall
identify the Business Net Revenues categorized by the Business customer, the
Business products purchased by such customer, the amount of the orders and the
dates the Business products were ordered and invoiced. The Buyer shall timely
deliver all such invoices to Business customers in a manner consistent with
Buyer's standard billing and invoicing practices and shall not delay the
issuance of such invoices or defer or forgive payment of any amounts that would
otherwise be due from Business customers under such invoices. The Buyer shall
make available (at the Buyer's offices and during reasonable business hours
mutually agreed to between the parties) to the Seller and Seller's
representatives all reasonable documentation necessary to review and confirm the
Business Net Revenues Statement. For the purpose of this Agreement, "BUSINESS
NET REVENUES" shall mean all sales made from the period beginning February 1,
2003 and ending December 31, 2003 to any person or entity of (i) Business
products acquired as part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
(ii) transponder products of the Buyer sold as part of the NetMentor
application, resulting in revenues recognizable under GAAP, less aged
receivables in excess of one hundred twenty (120) days, credits, returns,
allowances, discounts in the ordinary course of business, insurance, freight and
taxes, as determined in accordance with GAAP. The Buyer and Seller shall each
pay one-half (1/2) of all third party fees and costs necessary to prepare the
Business Net Revenues Statement.

               (ii) The Business Net Revenues Statement will be deemed to be the
final, binding and conclusive Business Net Revenues Statement (the "FINAL
BUSINESS NET REVENUES STATEMENT") for all purposes at, and at all times after,
the close of business on the thirtieth (30th) day after the Net Revenues
Delivery Date unless the Seller delivers to the Buyer written notice of its
disagreement (a "NET REVENUES NOTICE OF DISAGREEMENT") prior to the close of
business on the thirtieth (30th) day after the Net Revenues Delivery Date
specifying in reasonable detail the nature of the Seller's objections to the
Business Net Revenues Statement. To be assertable in a Net Revenues Notice of
Disagreement, an objection by the Seller with respect to any individual item on
the Business Net Revenues Statement must (A) assert that the Business Net
Revenues Statement was not prepared in accordance with the terms of SECTION
1.3(b)(i) to the extent that such an assertion can be made based on the
information available to


                                      -10-

<PAGE>

Seller and (B) relate to an adjustment equal to or greater than Twenty Five
Thousand U.S. Dollars ($25,000). The Seller hereby waives the right to assert
any objection to the Business Net Revenues Statement that is not asserted in a
Net Revenues Notice of Disagreement delivered by the Seller to the Buyer prior
to the close of business on the thirtieth (30th) day after the Net Revenues
Delivery Date. If a Net Revenues Notice of Disagreement is delivered by the
Seller to the Buyer within such thirty (30) day period, then the Business Net
Revenues Statement (as adjusted, if necessary) will be deemed to be the Final
Business Net Revenues Statement for all purposes on the earlier of (x) the date
the Buyer and the Seller resolve in writing all differences they have with
respect to the Business Net Revenues Statement, or (y) the date the disputed
matters are resolved in writing by the Unaffiliated Firm. In the event that
disputed matters are resolved by the Unaffiliated Firm, the Business Net
Revenues Statement will consist of the applicable amounts from the Business Net
Revenues Statement (or amounts otherwise agreed to in writing by the Buyer and
the Seller) as to items that have not been submitted for resolution to the
Unaffiliated Firm, and the amounts determined by the Unaffiliated Firm as to
items that were submitted for resolution by the Unaffiliated Firm.

               (iii) During the twenty (20) day period following the delivery of
a Net Revenues Notice of Disagreement (the "NET REVENUES RESOLUTION PERIOD"),
the Buyer and the Seller will seek in good faith to resolve any differences they
may have with respect to matters specified in the Net Revenues Notice of
Disagreement. If, at the end of the Net Revenues Resolution Period, the Buyer
and the Seller have not reached agreement on such matters, the Buyer and the
Seller will jointly engage the Unaffiliated Firm to resolve all matters which
remain in dispute with respect to the Business Net Revenues Statement by
arbitration in accordance with the procedures set forth in this SECTION
1.3(b)(iii). In connection with such engagement, each of the Buyer and the
Seller agrees to execute, if requested by the Unaffiliated Firm, an engagement
letter on terms reasonably satisfactory to each of the Buyer and the Seller
including customary indemnities. Each of the Buyer and the Seller may submit in
writing to the Unaffiliated Firm a position statement together with any
applicable supporting documentation it desires (each, a "NET REVENUES POSITION
STATEMENT") with respect to each of the Buyer's calculations of the Business Net
Revenues that remain in dispute following the Net Revenues Resolution Period.
Net Revenues Position Statements, if any, shall be delivered to the Unaffiliated
Firm, with a copy to the other Party hereto (at the same time as it is provided
to the Unaffiliated Firm), no later than the later of (x) the third (3rd)
Business Day following the date the Unaffiliated Firm accepts its engagement
hereunder, or (y) the thirtieth (30th) day following the end of the Net Revenues
Resolution Period. Promptly after such engagement of the Unaffiliated Firm, the
Buyer or the Seller will provide the Unaffiliated Firm with a copy of this
Agreement, the Business Net Revenues Statement, the Net Revenues Notice of
Disagreement and, if applicable, the Net Revenues Position Statements. The
Unaffiliated Firm will have the authority to request in writing such additional
written submissions from either the Buyer or the Seller as it deems appropriate;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that a copy of any such submission will be provided to the
other Party at the same time as it is provided to the Unaffiliated Firm. Neither
Party will make (or permit any of its parents, subsidiaries, affiliates,
representatives or employees to make) any additional submission to the
Unaffiliated Firm except pursuant to such a written request by the Unaffiliated
Firm. Neither Party will communicate (or permit any of its parents,
subsidiaries, affiliates, representatives or employees to communicate) with the
Unaffiliated Firm without providing the other Party a reasonable opportunity to
participate in


                                      -11-

written submissions in response to the written request of the Unaffiliated
Firm). The Unaffiliated Firm will have thirty (30) days to review the documents
provided to it pursuant to this SECTION 1.3(b)(iii). Within such thirty (30) day
period, the Unaffiliated Firm will furnish simultaneously to both parties its
written determination with respect to each of the adjustments in dispute
submitted to it for resolution. The Unaffiliated Firm will resolve the
differences regarding the Business Net Revenues Statement based solely on the
information provided to the Unaffiliated Firm by the Buyer and the Seller
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement (and not independent review). The
Unaffiliated Firm's authority will be limited to resolving disputes with respect
to whether the Business Net Revenues Statement was prepared in accordance with
SECTION 1.3(b)(i) with respect to the individual items on the Business Net
Revenues Statement in dispute (it being understood that the Unaffiliated Firm
will have no authority to make any adjustments to any amounts other than amounts
set forth in the Business Net Revenues Statement that are in dispute). In
resolving any disputed item, the Unaffiliated Firm may not assign a value to
such item greater than the greatest value for such item asserted by either Party
or less than the smallest value for such item asserted by either Party.

               (iv) The decision of the Unaffiliated Firm will be, for all
purposes, conclusive, non-appealable, final and binding upon the Seller, the
Buyer and each of their parents, subsidiaries or affiliates. Such decision will
be subject to specific performance pursuant to SECTION 7.10, and judgment may
also be entered thereon as an arbitration award pursuant to the Federal
Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. ss.ss. 1-16, in any court of competent jurisdiction
specified in SECTION 7.12. The fees of the Unaffiliated Firm will be borne
equally by the Buyer and the Seller. Unless otherwise set forth herein, each
Party will bear the fees, costs and expenses of its own accountants and all of
its other expenses in connection with matters contemplated by this SECTION
1.3(b).

               (v) (A) Upon the Business Net Revenues Statement being deemed the
Final Business Net Revenues Statement in accordance with SECTION 1.3(B), the
following payment (the "EARN-OUT PAYMENT") will be made by the Buyer to the
Seller: if the amount of the Business Net Revenues exceeds Thirteen Million

shall be equal to One U.S. Dollar ($1) for each dollar that the Business Net
Revenues exceed Thirteen Million Seven Hundred Fifty Thousand U.S. Dollars
($13,750,000); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that in no event shall the aggregate amount of
the Earn-Out Payment exceed Two Million Four Hundred Thousand U.S. Dollars
($2,400,000).

                   (B) Under no circumstances shall the Seller be entitled to
any Earn-Out Payment in the event the Business Net Revenues set forth on the
Business Net Revenues Statement do not exceed Thirteen Million Seven Hundred
Fifty Thousand U.S. Dollars ($13,750,000);

                   (C) Any payment required under SECTION 1.3(b)(v) will be

               (xv) the Parties shall have delivered to each other copies of all
registrations, filings and notices with or to Governmental Entities in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (the "GOVERNMENTAL
FILINGS"), all of which Governmental Filings are listed in SECTION 1.5(b)(xvii)
of the Disclosure Schedule, other than Governmental Filings that are Deferred
Items subject to SECTION 1.6.

               (xvi) the Parties shall execute and deliver to each other a
cross-receipt evidencing the transactions referred to above.

The agreements and instruments referred to in clauses (iii) through (xvi) above
are referred to herein as the "ANCILLARY AGREEMENTS."

     1.6  CONSENTS TO ASSIGNMENT. (a) Anything in this Agreement to the contrary
notwithstanding, this Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to assign or
transfer any Contract, Material Contract, lease, authorization, license or Legal
Permit, or any claim, right or benefit arising thereunder or resulting therefrom
or to undertake to make a Governmental Filing, if an attempted assignment or
transfer thereof or an undertaking to make a filing, without the consent,
approval or acknowledgment of a third party thereto or of the issuing
Governmental Entity, as the case may be, would constitute a breach thereof.
SCHEDULE 1.6(a) of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list of all Contracts,
Material Contracts, leases, authorizations, licenses or Legal Permits to be
transferred to the Buyer pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (the "DEFERRED ITEMS") for which such a consent, approval,
acknowledgment or filing (a "DEFERRED CONSENT") has not been obtained or for
which an attempted assignment or transfer thereof would be ineffective or would
affect the rights thereunder so that the Buyer would not receive all of the
rights thereunder. The Parties hereto acknowledge and agree that, subject to
Section 1.6(b) hereof, each Deferred Item shall be withheld from sale pursuant
to this Agreement without any reduction in the Purchase Price.

          (b) SCHEDULE 1.6(b) of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list of
certain of the Deferred Items, the Deferred Consents relating to which shall be
obtained by Seller and delivered to Buyer no later than thirty (30) days
following the Closing Date (the "SHORT TERM DEFERRED CONSENTS") and a list of
certain of the Deferred Items, the Deferred Consents relating to which shall be
obtained by Seller and delivered to Buyer no later than sixty (60) days
following the Closing Date (the "LONG TERM DEFERRED CONSENTS"). From and after
the Closing, the Seller and the Buyer will cooperate, in all reasonable
respects, to obtain the Short Term Deferred Consents and the Long Term Deferred
Consents within the time periods applicable thereto, provided that, except as
otherwise set forth herein, the Seller shall not be required to make any
payments or agree to any material undertakings in connection therewith. Until
the Short Term Deferred Consents and the Long Term Deferred Consents are
obtained, the Seller and the Buyer will cooperate, in all reasonable respects,
to provide to the Buyer the benefits under the applicable Deferred Item (with
the Buyer entitled to all the gains and responsible for all the losses, Taxes,
liabilities and/or obligations thereunder to the extent such losses, Taxes,
liabilities and/or obligations are not caused by the action or inaction of
Seller). In particular, the Buyer and the Seller shall provide (by entering into
oral or written arrangements, including, but not limited to, through subleasing
or subcontracting, if permitted) to the Parties the economic and operational
equivalent of obtaining the Short Term Deferred Consents and the Long Term
Deferred Consents and performance under the Bundled Contracts and assigning or
transferring

                                      -15-

<PAGE>

each such contract, lease, authorization, license or permit, including
enforcement for the benefit of the Buyer of all claims or rights arising
thereunder, and the performance by the Buyer of the obligations thereunder.

          (c) The Parties acknowledge and agree that certain of the Deferred
Items consist of Contracts which relate to both products and/or services of the
Business acquired hereunder and products and/or services of other portions of
the Seller's business (the "BUNDLED CONTRACTS"), and such Bundled Contracts are
listed on SECTION 1.6(c) of the Disclosure Schedule. Notwithstanding that the
Bundled Contracts are classified as Retained Shared Assets hereunder, the intent
of the Parties is to cause such Bundled Contracts to be replicated or otherwise
severed such that the Buyer will obtain the rights and obligations pertaining to
the portion of the Bundled Contracts relating to the Business and the Seller
shall retain the rights and obligations of the Bundled Contracts relating to
matters other than the Business. In lieu of obtaining a Deferred Consent
relating to a Bundled Contract, each of the Seller and the Buyer shall have the
right to use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain separate agreements
relating to the subject matter of the Bundled Contracts with the counterparties
thereto on substantially equivalent terms and conditions as the applicable terms
and conditions set forth in the Bundled Contract. In the event that the Parties
elect to negotiate separate agreements with the counterparties of one or more
Bundled Contracts, the Parties shall reasonably cooperate with each other in
coordinating and effecting such negotiations and shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts to have in place such separate contracts on or before the
date by which the Short Term Deferred Consent or the Long Term Deferred Consent,
as the case may be relating to such Bundled Contract, must have been obtained
pursuant to Section 1.6(b) hereof.

          (d) The Seller shall promptly provide to the Buyer each Deferred
Consent received by the Seller, and the Deferred Item to which such Deferred
Consent relates shall be deemed to be transferred to the Buyer, without the
necessity of the execution or delivery of further instrument(s) of transfer, as
of the date such Deferred Consent is delivered to the Buyer.

          (e) The Seller shall provide to the Buyer such information as the
Buyer shall reasonably request relating to (i) the status of the process of
obtaining the Deferred Consents, and (ii) the rights and responsibilities of
each party to a Deferred Item. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
the Seller shall provide to the Buyer, at such times and in such a manner as the
Buyer shall reasonably request, information relating to sales orders (including,
but not limited to, prices, quantities, shipment terms and times and payment
terms) applicable to Buyer pursuant to the Deferred Items. The Seller shall use
its best efforts to collect, for the benefit of the Buyer and on or before the
due date for payment thereunder, all remuneration due pursuant to the terms of a
Deferred Item. The Seller shall remit to the Buyer, within five (5) Business
Days of receipt by the Seller, the portion of such remuneration due to the Buyer
for the Business products and/or services provided by the Buyer pursuant to such
Deferred Item. Seller shall also remit to the Buyer, within five (5) Business
Days of demand therefor, payment for all losses, Taxes, liabilities and/or
obligations pursuant to a Deferred Item to the extent such losses, Taxes,
liabilities and/or obligations are caused by the action or inaction of Seller.
Any payment required to be made pursuant to this SECTION 1.6(e) shall be made by
wire transfer to an account designated by the Buyer to the Seller.

     1.7  FURTHER ASSURANCES. At any time and from time to time after the
Closing Date, as and when requested by any Party hereto and at such Party's
expense, the other Party or Parties shall promptly execute and deliver, or cause
to be executed and delivered, all such documents, instruments and certificates
and shall take, or cause to be taken, all such further or other actions as are
necessary to evidence and effectuate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

          (a) The Seller has filed or had filed on its behalf all Tax Returns
(as defined below) that it was required to file (separately or as part of a
consolidated, combined or unitary group) and all such Tax Returns were true,
correct and complete, except for any error or omission that would not reasonably
be expected to result in a Business Material Adverse Effect. The Seller has paid
(or had paid on its behalf) all Taxes (as defined below) that have become due
and payable for all periods covered by the Tax Returns and any interim payments
which may have been required under Law since the date of such Tax Returns,
except where the failure to make such payment would not reasonably be expected
to result in a Business Material Adverse Effect. To the Seller's Knowledge, no
Governmental Entity, located in a jurisdiction where the Seller does not file
Tax Returns, has claimed that the Business or Acquired Assets are subject to
taxation in such jurisdiction. No Taxes are currently under audit by any
Governmental Entity, and neither the IRS, nor any other Governmental Entity is
now asserting or, to the Knowledge of the Seller, threatening to assert against
the Seller any deficiency or claim for additional Taxes or any adjustment of
such Taxes. All Taxes that the Seller is or was required by Laws to withhold or
collect have been duly withheld or collected and, to the extent required, have
been paid to the proper Governmental Entity, except for any such Taxes with
respect to which the failure to withhold, collect or pay would not have a
Business Material Adverse Effect. For purposes of this Agreement, "Taxes" means
all taxes, including, without limitation, income, gross receipts, ad valorem,
value-added, excise, real property, personal property, sales, use, transfer,
withholding, employment, social security charges and franchise taxes imposed by
the United States of America or any state, local or foreign government, or any
agency thereof, or other political subdivision of the United States or any such
government, and any interest, penalties, assessments or additions to tax
resulting from, attributable to or incurred in connection with any tax or any
contest or dispute thereof. For purposes of this Agreement, "Tax Returns" means
all reports, returns, declarations, statements, forms or other information
required to be supplied to a Governmental Entity responsible for the imposition
of Taxes in connection with Taxes.



                                      -20-
<PAGE>

          (b) There are no Security Interests on the Acquired Assets that have
arisen in connection with any failure to pay any Tax.

     2.8  ACQUIRED ASSETS. The Seller has good and valid title to, a good and
valid leasehold interest in or a good and valid license or right to use, all of
the Acquired Assets, free and clear of all Security Interests. Except as set
forth on SECTION 2.8 OF the Disclosure Schedules, the Acquired Assets comprise
all assets required for the continued conduct of the Business by the Buyer after
the Closing in the manner the Business is now being conducted by the Seller and
has been conducted by the Seller in the twelve (12) month period preceding the
Closing Date. The Acquired Assets, taken as a whole, constitute all properties
and assets relating to or used or held for use in connection with the Business
during the past twelve (12) months (except for Inventories sold, cash disposed
of, or accounts receivable collected, expenses prepaid, contracts and agreements
fully performed, or properties or assets replaced, in each case in the ordinary
course of business, and except for the Excluded Assets). To the Knowledge of the
Seller, there are no facts or conditions affecting the Acquired Assets which
would, individually or in the aggregate, interfere with the use, occupancy or
operation thereof as currently used, occupied or operated, or their adequacy for
such use. The Acquired Assets, taken as a whole, are in good working order and
condition, subject to normal wear and tear and sufficient for the operation of
the Business in the same manner Seller has operated the Business during the
twelve (12) month period preceding the Closing Date.

     2.9  REAL PROPERTY. Except as set forth on SECTION 2.9 of the Disclosure
Schedules, the Seller does not own or lease any real property.

     2.10 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.

correct and complete list of all Seller Intellectual Property that is (i) owned
by Seller (the "Owned Seller Intellectual Property"), and (ii) licensed or
otherwise made available for use to Seller by third parties (the "Licensed
Seller Intellectual Property").

          (b) The Seller is the sole owner of all Owned Seller Intellectual
Property. Seller has a license or the right to use, pursuant to license,
sublicense, agreement or permission, all Licensed Seller Intellectual Property.
The Seller Intellectual Property is (i) free and clear of all Security
Interests, and (ii) except as set forth in SECTION 2.10(b) of the Disclosure
Schedules, not subject to any requirement of any past, present or future royalty
payments, license fees, charges or other payments or restrictions, except for
claims by third parties against licensors or vendors of Commercial Software (as
defined in SECTION 2.10(g)) to the Seller. Except as set forth on SECTION
2.10(b) of the Disclosure Schedules, the Seller Intellectual Property comprises
all of the Intellectual Property used, held for use or material to the Business.
Immediately after the Closing, the Buyer will own all Owned Seller Intellectual
Property, free from any Security Interest and on the same terms and conditions
as in effect prior to the Closing. Immediately after the Closing, the Buyer will
have a good and valid license, or the right to use all Licensed Seller

Intellectual Property upon the lapse of time, the giving of notice or the
occurrence of a contingency, except for the licenses for Commercial Software.
All of the agreements and arrangements set forth in SECTION 2.10(c) of the
Disclosure Schedule (i) are in full force and effect and enforceable in

entity, except where such default would not reasonably be likely to have a
Business Material Adverse Effect (ii) are free and clear of all Security
Interests, and (iii) do not contain any change in control or other terms or
conditions that will become applicable or inapplicable as a result of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements, except where such terms or conditions would not reasonably
be likely to have a Business Material Adverse Effect. The Seller has delivered
to the Buyer true, correct and complete copies of all written Contracts,
licenses and arrangements (including amendments, supplements, waivers and other
modifications) set forth on SECTION 2.10(c) of the Disclosure Schedule and
written summaries of all oral agreements or arrangements set forth on SECTION
2.10(c) of the Disclosure Schedule. SECTION 2.10(c) sets forth a true, correct
and complete description of all royalties, license fees, charges and other

of any Seller Intellectual Property.

          (d) Except as set forth on SECTION 2.10(d) of the Disclosure Schedule,
to the Seller's Knowledge, the use of the Seller Intellectual Property in
connection with the Business does not infringe upon or otherwise conflict with
any intellectual property rights of any person or entity, except for claims by
third parties against licensors or vendors of Commercial Software to the Seller
that would not reasonably be expected to have a Business Material Adverse
Effect, and the Seller has no Knowledge of any such claim or any reasonable
basis upon which such a claim could be made. To the Seller's Knowledge, the
Seller Intellectual Property is not being infringed and is not being used or
available for use by any person or entity without a license or permission from
the Seller.

          (e) Except as set forth in SECTION 2.10(e) of the Disclosure Schedule,
no claim or demand of any person or entity has been made against the Seller or,
to the Knowledge of the Seller, threatened, nor is there any litigation that is
pending or threatened that (i) challenges the rights of the Seller in respect of
any Seller Intellectual Property, (ii) asserts that the Seller Intellectual
Property is infringing or otherwise in conflict with any intellectual property
or related right of any third party, (iii) claims that any default exists under
any agreement or arrangement related to the Seller Intellectual Property set
forth on SECTION 2.10(c) of the Disclosure Schedules or (iv) asserts that the
Seller is required to pay any royalty, license fee, charge or other amount with
regard to any Seller Intellectual Property, in each case except for claims or
demands that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be likely
to have a Business Material Adverse Effect. To the Knowledge of the Seller, none
of the Seller Intellectual Property is subject to any outstanding order, ruling,
decree, judgment or stipulation by or with any court, tribunal, arbitrator or
other Governmental Entity.

including, without limitation, all modifications and enhancements thereto
(whether created by the Seller or by a Third Party), is in compliance with the
terms and provisions of such licenses, other than minor noncompliance that could
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Business
Material Adverse Effect. SECTION 2.10(f) of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth a

                         EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

     4.1  DEFINITION OF ACTIVE EMPLOYEES. For the purpose of this Agreement, the

military leave, short-term or long-term disability or sick leave or other leave.
All Active Employees are listed on SECTION 4.1 of the Disclosure Schedules,
along with their position, their annual rate of compensation and their status.

     4.2  EMPLOYMENT OF ACTIVE EMPLOYEES BY THE BUYER.


          (a) The Buyer shall have the right, but not the obligation, to extend
offers of employment to those Active Employees that Buyer deems, in its sole
discretion, essential to the operation of the Business. SECTION 4.2 of the
Disclosure Schedules contains a list of Active Employees to whom the Buyer
anticipates it will make an offer of employment that will be effective on or
after the Closing Date (the "POTENTIAL EMPLOYEES"); provided however, that
nothing in this Agreement or otherwise shall obligate Buyer to make offers of
employment to, or to actually employ, the Potential Employees. An Active
Employee or a Potential Employee who accepts employment with the Buyer shall
sometimes be referred to herein as a "Hired


                                      -31-

<PAGE>

Employee". Effective immediately prior to the Closing Date, the Seller shall
terminate the employment of each such Potential Employee, and Seller shall
terminate the employment of each Active Employee who becomes a Hired Employee
following the Closing Date, such termination to be effective immediately prior
to such Active Employee becoming a Hired Employee. Seller hereby releases all
Potential Employees from, and Seller covenants and agrees that it will not
enforce or seek to enforce, any noncompetition agreements any Potential
Employees have entered into with Seller.

          (b) It is understood and agreed that employment offered by the Buyer
to the Potential Employees will be "at will" and may be terminated by the Buyer
or by the Hired Employee at any time for any reason (subject to any written
commitments to the contrary made by the Buyer and an employee and Laws). Nothing
in this Agreement shall be deemed to prevent or restrict in any way the right of
the Buyer to terminate, reassign, promote or demote any of the Hired Employees
after the Closing or to change adversely or favorably the title, powers, duties,
responsibilities, functions, locations, salaries, other compensation or terms or
conditions of employment of such Hired Employees.

     4.3  EMPLOYEE RELATED OBLIGATIONS AND LIABILITIES.

shall be within Seller's sole discretion. After the Closing Date, the Buyer
shall be solely and exclusively responsible for the performance and discharge of
all employment-related obligations and liabilities relating to the Hired
Employees but only to the extent that such obligations and liabilities arise out

          (b) Except as otherwise provided in this ARTICLE IV or as otherwise
required by applicable Law, each Hired Employee shall cease to participate in or
accrue further benefits under the Business Benefit Plans at the later of
immediately prior to the Closing or the time such Hired Employee becomes an

for the purposes of (i) eligibility for participation and vesting under Buyer's
401(k) plan, and (ii) eligibility for participation in Buyer's medical, dental
insurance and other welfare plans currently offered by the Buyer. The Seller
shall be liable for any claims made or incurred by Active Employees and their

thereunder.

PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no such reimbursements shall be required for the salary
or cost of fringe benefits or similar expenses pertaining to employees of the
providing Party.

          (d) RETENTION OF RECORDS. Except as may otherwise be required by Law
or agreed to in writing by the Parties, each Party shall use reasonable
commercial efforts to preserve, until four (4) years after the Closing Date, all
Information in its possession or control pertaining to the Business prior to the
Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in lieu of retaining any specific
Information, any Party may offer in writing to the other Party or Parties to
deliver such Information to the other Party or Parties, and if such offer is not
accepted within ninety (90) days of the giving thereof, the offered Information
may be disposed of at any time.

          (e) CONFIDENTIALITY. Each Party shall hold, and shall use reasonable
commercial efforts to cause their respective parents, subsidiaries and

<PAGE>

hold, in strict confidence all Information concerning the other furnished to it
by the other Party or Parties or their representatives pursuant to this SECTION
5.1 (except to the extent that such Information (i) is or becomes generally
available to the public other than as a result of any action or inaction by the
receiving Party, (ii) was within the possession of the receiving Party prior to
it being furnished to the receiving Party by or on behalf of the disclosing
Party pursuant hereto, provided that the source of such information was not
bound by a confidentiality agreement with or other contractual, legal or
fiduciary obligation of confidentiality to any person or entity with respect to
such information, or (iii) is or becomes available on a non-confidential basis
to the receiving Party from a source other than the disclosing Party, provided
that the source of such information was not bound by a confidentiality agreement
with or other contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation of confidentiality to
any person or entity with respect to such Information), and each Party shall not
release or disclose such Information to any other person, except its auditors,
attorneys, financial advisors, bankers and other consultants and advisors,
unless compelled to disclose such Information by judicial or administrative
process or by other requirements of Law or so as not to violate the rules of any

judicial or administrative process, the receiving Party shall (to the extent
permitted by applicable Laws) notify the disclosing Party promptly of the
request and the documents requested thereby so that the disclosing Party may
seek an appropriate protective order or other appropriate remedy. If, in the
absence of a protective order or other remedy or the receipt of a waiver
hereunder, a Party is, in the written opinion of its counsel, compelled to
disclose any Information to any tribunal or other entity or else stand liable
for contempt or suffer other censure or penalty, such Party may so disclose the
Information without liability hereunder; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, such Party
gives written notice to the other Party of the Information to be disclosed
(including copies of the relevant portions of the relevant documents) as far in
advance of its disclosure as is practicable, uses all reasonable efforts to
limit any such disclosure to the precise terms of such requirement, and
cooperates with the disclosing Party to obtain an appropriate protective order
or other reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to such
Information by the tribunal or other entity.

     5.2  USE OF NAME FOR TRANSITION PERIOD.

          (a) Following the Closing, except as otherwise provided herein, the

material clearly and prominently displays the following statement or a statement
of similar import, the form of which shall be approved by the Seller (which such
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned): "[THE
BUYER PRODUCT NAME], formerly a product of [SELLER NAME]." Promptly following
the Closing Date, the Buyer will implement and deliver to the Seller a written
plan to eliminate the use of all such material within such three (3) month
period;

               (ii) continue to use the Retained Marks following the Closing

          (c) The licenses to use the Retained Marks set forth in this SECTION

affiliates from using the Retained Marks (or any similar name or logo) during
the term of the respective license or thereafter in any manner. The Buyer agrees
that its use of the Retained Marks shall be consistent with the past practices
of the Seller and its direct and indirect subsidiaries in connection with their
business and operations and, with respect to such use, the Buyer shall adhere to
substantially similar quality standards to which the Seller and its direct and
indirect subsidiaries adhered immediately prior to the Closing.

     5.3  USE OF RETAINED MARKS IN TRANSFERRED TECHNOLOGY. The Seller and the
Buyer shall cooperate and use reasonable commercial efforts to provide to the
Buyer for inclusion in its web site, as promptly as practicable following the
Closing, all text, images and other content contained in all web sites relating
to the Business maintained by the Seller (or its parents, subsidiaries or
affiliates). Subject to the provisions of SECTION 5.2, prior to including any
such text, images or other content in its web site, the Buyer shall remove all
references to the Retained Marks from any such text, images or other content.
The Seller (or its parents, subsidiaries or affiliates) shall retain ownership
of all domain names listed on SCHEDULE 5.3 and neither the Buyer nor any of its
affiliates shall have any right or license to any such domain name. To the
extent the Business utilized any internet protocol address space allocated to
the Seller, such internet protocol address space shall remain the property of
the Seller, and no rights or licenses are granted to the Buyer with respect
thereto.

     5.4  PAYMENT OF EXCLUDED LIABILITIES. In the event that the Buyer (or its
parent, subsidiary or affiliate) inadvertently pays or discharges, after the

parent, subsidiary or affiliate) for the amount so paid or discharged within
thirty (30) days of being presented with written evidence of such payment or
discharge.

use is permitted by any such Business customer, person or entity. On and after
the Closing Date, the Seller shall cease the use of such equipment,



                                      -36-

<PAGE>

instruments and other items, and provide the Buyer with the sole benefit of the
aforementioned items.

     5.7  RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS.

          (a) NON-COMPETITION. During the period commencing on the Closing Date
and ending on the third (3rd) anniversary thereof (the "RESTRICTION PERIOD"),
the Seller and its successors and assigns shall not, and Seller shall cause its
and their respective parents, subsidiaries and affiliates, and the employees of
each of them, not to, (i) engage or aid any person or entity to engage, directly
or indirectly, anywhere in the world, in any business that competes with the
monitoring of element status within a hybrid fiber-coax ("HFC") broadband
communications network, specifically, the following: (A) status monitoring of
inside or outside plant elements including, but not limited to, optical nodes,
power supplies, amplifiers, transmitters, receivers and related equipment, only
as it pertains to the operational health or physical status of such equipment,
excluding customer premise equipment (B) monitoring of the physical environment,
(C) automated FCC proof of performance testing for the purpose of generating
reports to be filed with the FCC, (D) element management system software related
to all of the above-listed monitoring applications, including developments in
Seller's Vision 360 application suite that would provide the above functions,
and (E) service offerings related to all of the above-listed monitoring
applications, (a "COMPETITIVE BUSINESS"), provided, however, that the Seller
shall not be precluded from (A) developing, manufacturing or distributing
products which transmit, acquire or collect signal data that is contained,
carried or transmitted over the HFC broadband communications network and (B) if
an element provides information specific to the analog or digital signals or

analyze or utilize such information, or (ii) own an interest in, manage,
operate, join, control or participate in or be associated with as a partner,

consultant, lender or otherwise, any other person or entity that engages in a
Competitive Business, provided, however, that nothing in this Agreement shall
prohibit the Seller from acquiring an entity (or all or a portion of its assets)
which may be engaged in a Competitive Business, provided that the provisions of
this Section 5.7(a) shall apply to the affected assets Seller acquired in such
acquisition. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing set forth above shall
prevent the Seller from (x) manufacturing, distributing, or selling its Phasor
or PathTrak return path monitoring products for the cable industry or (y)
maintaining the interoperability of Seller's products, including, but not
limited to, (i) the Phaser and PathTrak products, and (ii) Acterna's Vision 360
Product family working in conjunction with other systems, including, but not
limited to, the Scientific Atlanta TNCS system, to process and manage status
monitoring output, with the products of a Competitive Business; provided,
however, that, in the geographic territory (the "RESTRICTED TERRITORIES") in
which current customers of the Business have deployed NetMentor, Seller shall
not (A) by itself or in concert with any such Competitive Business, market or
otherwise promote such interoperability to the customers of the Business as of
the Closing Date or (B) enter into any reseller or other similar arrangement
with any such Competitive Business with respect to such interoperability.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, during the Restriction Period, the Seller
wishes to develop and promote interoperability in the Restricted Territories to
customers of the Business with respect to features or functionalities of
products of a Competitive Business which become available or are developed after
the Closing Date (the "EVOLUTIONARY Interoperability"), the Seller shall first



                                      -37-
<PAGE>

seek to develop and maintain the Evolutionary Interoperability with the Buyer.
In such event, the Seller shall deliver written notice (the "SELLER NOTICE") of
its intent to promote and develop the Evolutionary Interoperability to the
Buyer. If (i) within 30 days of the date of the Seller Notice, the Seller has
not received a written commitment (the "BUYER COMMITMENT") from the Buyer to
actively participate in such development and (ii) within 60 days of the date of
the Seller Notice, the Buyer does not in commit in writing to a product plan
(the "PRODUCT PLAN") for the Evolutionary Interoperability, the Seller shall be
permitted to promote and develop the Evolutionary Interoperability free of any
of the restrictions in this Agreement. In addition, if Buyer does not actively
fulfill its obligations under the Product Plan, the Seller shall be permitted to
promote and develop the Evolutionary Interoperability free of any of the
restrictions in this Agreement.

          (b) NO HIRE/NON-SOLICITATION COVENANTS. During the Restriction Period,
the Seller shall not, and shall cause their respective parents, subsidiaries and
affiliates not to, anywhere in the world, directly or indirectly, for its own
account or for the account of any other person or entity, (i) hire any natural
person who is or was, at any time during the twelve (12) months preceding the
Closing Date, employed by or otherwise engaged to perform services for the
Buyer. During the Restriction Period, the Buyer shall not, and shall cause their
respective parents, subsidiaries and affiliates not to, anywhere in the world,
directly or indirectly, for its own account or for the account of any other
person or entity, (i) except for the Potential Employees and employees of the
Seller whose employment Seller has terminated, solicit for employment or hire
any natural person who is or was, at any time during the twelve (12) months
preceding the Closing Date, employed by or otherwise engaged to perform services
or sell products of the Seller.

          (c) REMEDIES. In accordance with SECTION 7.10 of this Agreement, the
Seller acknowledges and agrees that the Buyer, in addition to any other rights
and remedies the Buyer may have at law or in equity, shall be entitled to an
order of specific performance, injunction, restraining order or such other
interim or permanent equitable relief (without the requirement to post bond)
restraining a breaching party from committing any violation of the covenants and
obligations contained in this SECTION 5.7.

          (d) If any provision of this SECTION 5.7 shall be adjudged to be
excessively broad as to duration, geographical scope, activity or subject, or
are held to be unreasonable, arbitrary, or against public policy, the Parties
hereto intend that such provision shall be deemed modified to the minimum degree
necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable under applicable Laws and
that such modified provision shall thereafter be enforced to the fullest extent
possible.

     5.8  RELEASES OF SECURITY INTERESTS. Subject to Seller's obligations
pursuant to the final paragraph of SECTION 2.3 hereof, following the Closing
Date, the Buyer shall prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed, all

Interests on the Acquired Assets. All costs associated with such


                                      -38-
<PAGE>

preparation and filing shall be borne equally by the Buyer and the Seller, and
the Seller shall pay, by wire transfer to an account designated by the Buyer,
its share of the cost of such preparation and filing within five (5) Business
Days of the Buyer's request for such payments. Such request shall be accompanied
by reasonable supporting documentation showing the costs associated with such
preparation and filing. In the event that the cost of preparing and filing the
Form UCC-3 termination statements required to evidence the release of the
Security Interests on the Acquired Assets shall exceed Thirty Thousand U.S.
Dollars ($30,000), the Buyer shall notify the Seller thereof.

     5.9  REMOTE INVENTORY. The Seller shall, at its sole cost and expense,
deliver or cause to be delivered all Acquired Assets located at the Seller's
Indianapolis, Indiana facility either to the premises being sublet from the
Seller in Bradenton, Florida or to one or more contract manufacturers. Such
delivery shall occur within ten (10) Business Days of the Buyer's request
therefor, and the Seller shall be responsible for, and shall reimburse the Buyer
for, damage to such Acquired Assets as a result of or in the course of such
delivery to the extent that such damage is caused by the Seller, its employees,
agents, representatives, contractors and independent contractors. In the event
that the Seller fails to deliver, or cause to be delivered, such Acquired Assets
as required by this SECTION 5.9, the Buyer shall have the right to arrange for
such delivery at the Seller's sole cost and expense, and the Seller shall pay or
reimburse the Buyer for the costs thereof within five (5) Business Days of the
Buyer's demand therefor.

     5.10 BUSINESS ORDER BACKLOG MATTERS. From and after the Closing Date, the
Seller shall not, on its own initiative, cancel or terminate, or permit any
Affiliate of Seller to, on its own initiative, cancel or terminate any portion
of the Backlog which consists of orders for products and/or services of the
Business acquired hereunder by Seller or any Affiliate of Seller ("Affiliate
Orders"); provided, however, that Seller or an Affiliate of Seller may cancel,
terminate, delay or otherwise alter an Affiliate Order, in whole or in part, to
the extent that (i) the customer of the Seller or an Affiliate of the Seller
cancels, terminates, delays or otherwise alters such Affiliate Order, in whole
or in part, (orally or in writing) and (ii) the Seller provides to the Buyer (A)
written or oral notice thereof and (B) reasonable opportunity to contact such
customer to confirm such cancellation, termination, delay or other alteration.
Notwithstanding the proviso in the immediately preceding sentence, Seller
acknowledges and agrees that the Affiliate Order listed on Section 5.10 of the
Disclosure Schedule shall not be canceled, terminated, delayed or otherwise
altered and the products shipped thereunder shall not be returnable except for
returns relating to valid warranty claims for defective products provided to the
Seller pursuant to such purchase order.

paid, to cause Seller to be qualified to do business in those United States
jurisdictions in which the Business was operated prior to the Closing Date and
in which Seller was not so qualified, and reflected on Schedule 2.11(a) of the
Disclosure Schedule.

Third Party Claims or the nature of and specific basis of any suit, action,
investigation or proceeding set forth therein, the amount or the good faith

          (b) THIRD PARTY CLAIMS; PROCEDURE. In the event that any Indemnified
Party seeks indemnification hereunder based on a Third Party Claim, the
Indemnifying Party shall have the right (without prejudice to the right of the
Indemnified Party to employ separate counsel at its own expense and to
participate in the defense of such Third Party Claim and in any compromise,
settlement or strategic decision relating thereto) to defend or prosecute such
Third Party Claim at its own expense through counsel of its own choosing if the
Indemnifying Party gives notice thereof to the Indemnified Party within thirty
(30) days after receipt of the Third Party Claim Notice or such shorter time
period as required so that the interests of the Indemnified Party would not be
materially prejudiced as a result of the failure to have received such notice
(the "ELECTION PERIOD"). Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the Indemnified
Party is hereby authorized during the Election Period to file any motion, answer
or other pleading that shall be necessary or appropriate to protect its rights
or the rights of the Indemnifying Party. If (i) the Election Period expires or
(ii) the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party during the Election
Period that the Indemnifying Party does not elect to defend or prosecute the
Third Party Claim for which the Indemnified Party would be entitled to
indemnification hereunder, then the Indemnified Party shall be entitled
prosecute or defend the Third Party Claim and recover from the Indemnifying
Party all of the reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorney's
fees) associated therewith. Notwithstanding the assumption of the defense of any
Third Party Claim by the Indemnified Party pursuant to this paragraph, the
Indemnifying Party shall have the right to approve the terms of settlement of
any Third Party Claim, which approval shall not be unreasonably delayed or
withheld.



                                      -41-

          (c) COOPERATION. The Parties agree reasonably to cooperate with one
another and their respective counsel in contesting and defending any Third Party
Claim in any manner the other party may reasonably request (including furnishing
evidence and testimony and granting reasonable access to the pertinent books,
records and personnel (to the extent such personnel are available) in their
possession or control) so as to not unreasonably expose the other to undue risk
of loss or, if appropriate and related to the Claim in question, in making (i)
any counterclaim against the Third Party asserting the Claims, or (ii) any cross
complaint against any Person.

          (d) NO SETTLEMENT. Notwithstanding anything in this SECTION 6.3 to the
contrary, the Indemnifying Party shall not, without the prior written consent of
the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed), (i) settle or compromise any Third Party Claim or consent to the entry
of any judgment with respect to such Third Party Claim that does not include as
an unconditional term thereof the delivery by the Third Party claimant or
plaintiff to the Indemnified Party of a written release from all liability in
respect to such Third Party Claim, (ii) settle or compromise any Third Party
Claim in any manner that may materially and adversely affect the Indemnified
Party, or (iii) settle or compromise any Claim in a manner that will require the
Indemnified Party to pay any money, except as contemplated by SECTION 6.3(b).

     6.4  DIRECT CLAIMS. In the event that the Indemnified Party has a Claim,
including an Indemnity Claim hereunder, that does not involve a Third Party
Claim, or knowledge of facts that could give rise to such a Claim, the
Indemnified Party shall transmit to the Indemnifying Party a written notice (the
"DIRECT CLAIM NOTICE") describing in reasonable detail the nature of the Claim,
an estimate of the amount of damages attributable to such Claim and the basis
for the request for indemnification under this Agreement. If the Indemnifying
Party does not notify the Indemnified Party within fifteen (15) days from its
receipt of the Direct Claim Notice that it disputes such Indemnity Claim, the
Indemnity Claims specified in the Direct Claim Notice will be deemed payable by
the Indemnifying Party hereunder. If the Indemnifying Party has timely disputed
such Indemnity Claim, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith for a thirty
(30) day period after receipt of the Direct Claim Notice to resolve such
Indemnity Claim. If no resolution is reached within such thirty (30) day period,
the dispute regarding the Indemnity Claim shall be resolved by litigation in a
court of competent jurisdiction.

     6.5  SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES AND TIME LIMITATION ON
INDEMNIFICATION. All of the representations and warranties set forth in this
Agreement shall survive the Closing and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing and without
limiting any other rights and remedies available to the parties, any assertion
by any Indemnified Party that an Indemnifying Party is liable for
indemnification under the terms of this ARTICLE VI must be made in writing and
must be given to the Indemnifying Party on or prior to the date that is fifteen
(15) months after the Closing Date; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the foregoing time
limitation shall not apply to assertions by an Indemnified Party that an
Indemnifying Party is liable for indemnification under the terms of this ARTICLE
VI based on breaches of the representations and warranties set forth in SECTIONS
2.2, 2.7, 2.8 or 2.12 or indemnification pursuant to SECTIONS 6.1(b) and (c) and
SECTIONS 6.2(b) through (h). The survival periods set forth in this SECTION 6.5
shall not be deemed in any way to limit the obligations of the Parties to
perform the covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement, including, but
not limited to, the covenants and agreements set forth in ARTICLES IV and V
hereof,


                                      -42-

<PAGE>
and to pay and discharge the obligations related thereto and the obligations
related to the Assumed Liabilities, in the case of Buyer, and the Excluded
Liabilities, in the case of the Seller.

     6.6  LIMITATION ON INDEMNITY.

          (a) INDEMNITY BASKET OF THE BUYER AND THE SELLER. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the Buyer and the Seller
acknowledge and agree that an Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to an
Indemnified Party in respect of any Indemnity Claim made pursuant to SECTION 6.1
or SECTION 6.2 hereunder until the amount of Claims comprising the Indemnity
Claim(s), individually or in the aggregate, exceeds Twenty Five Thousand U.S.
Dollars ($25,000) (the "INDEMNITY BASKET"), provided however, that if such
Indemnity Claims exceed Twenty Five Thousand U.S. Dollars ($25,000), an
Indemnifying Party shall be liable and the Indemnified Party may recover, on a
first dollar loss basis for all such Claims, subject to the Indemnity Cap (as
defined in SECTION 6.6(b)). The Indemnity Basket shall (i) be Five Thousand U.S.
Dollars ($5,000) for any Indemnity Claims by Buyer Indemnified Parties to the
extent such Indemnity Claims are based on a breach of the representations and
warranties made in SECTIONS 2.7(b) and 2.8, (ii) not apply to Indemnity Claims
by Buyer Indemnified Parties under SECTION 6.2(a)(but only to the extent such
Indemnity Claims are based on a breach of the representations and warranties
made in SECTIONS 2.2, 2.7(a), and 2.12) or under SECTIONS 6.2(b) through (f),
and (iii) not apply to Indemnity Claims by Buyer Indemnified Parties arising
from fraud, willful or criminal misconduct of the Seller Indemnified Parties
(collectively, the "SELLER INDEMNITY BASKET EXCLUSIONS"). The Seller shall be
responsible for the full amount of all Claims arising from the Seller Indemnity
Basket Exclusions, and the amount of such Claims shall be included in the
determination as to whether the Indemnity Basket is met for all other Indemnity
Claims by Buyer Indemnified Parties. The Indemnity Basket shall not apply to
Indemnity Claims by Seller Indemnified Parties (x) under SECTIONS 6.1(b) through
(C), or (y) arising from fraud, willful or criminal misconduct by the Buyer
Indemnified Parties (collectively, the "BUYER INDEMNITY BASKET EXCLUSIONS"). The
Buyer shall be responsible for the full amount of all Claims arising from the
matters addressed in the Buyer Indemnity Basket Exclusions, and the amount of
such Claims shall be included in the determination as to whether the Indemnity
Basket is met for all other Claims by Seller Indemnified Parties.

          (b) INDEMNITY CAP OF THE BUYER AND THE SELLER. The Buyer and the
Seller acknowledge and agree that in no event shall an Indemnifying Party ever
be required to indemnify an Indemnified Party for Indemnity Claims made pursuant
to SECTION 6.1 or SECTION 6.2 of this Agreement, in any amount exceeding: (i)
Twenty Percent (20%) of the Purchase Price, in the aggregate, in the case of
Indemnity Claims by the Buyer Indemnified Parties; and (ii) Twenty Percent (20%)
of the Purchase Price, in the aggregate, in the case of Indemnity Claims by the
Seller Indemnified Parties (each, an "INDEMNITY CAP"). The respective Indemnity
Caps shall not apply to Claims arising from or relating to the Seller Indemnity
Basket Exclusions and the Buyer Indemnity Basket Exclusions, and none of such
Claims shall be used to determine whether the applicable Indemnity Cap has been
met. Each Party agrees to use its best efforts to mitigate any Claim. Whenever
an Indemnifying Party is required to indemnify and hold harmless an Indemnified
Party from and against, or to reimburse an Indemnified Party for, a Claim, such
Indemnifying Party will, subject to the provisions of this ARTICLE VI, pay the
Indemnified Party the amount of such Claim reduced by the net proceeds of any
insurance policy received by the Indemnified Party with respect to such Claim.


                                      -43-
<PAGE>

     6.7  OVERALL LIMITATION ON LIABILITY. Anything in this Agreement to the
contrary notwithstanding, the maximum aggregate liability for any Claims,
whether or not such Claims are Indemnity Claims and whether arising in contract
or tort, shall not exceed (a) Thirty Percent (30%) of the Purchase Price in the
case of Claims payable by the Seller, and (b) Thirty Percent (30%) of the
Purchase Price in the case of Claims payable by the Buyer (each, an "Aggregate
Liability Cap"); provided, however, that the applicable Aggregate Liability Cap
shall not apply to (x) Claims of the Buyer Indemnified Parties arising from or
relating to the Seller Indemnity Basket Exclusions, and (y) Claims of the Seller
Indemnified Parties arising from or relating to the Buyer Indemnity Basket
Exclusions.

     6.8  SCOPE OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE PARTIES. Except as and
to the extent expressly set forth in this Agreement (together with the schedules
attached hereto and the items delivered pursuant to this Agreement), the Parties
make no representations or warranties whatsoever, and disclaim all liability and
responsibility for any representation, warranty, statement made or information
communicated (orally or in writing) to the other Party including, but not
limited to, any opinion, information or advice that many have been provided to
any Party by any officer, stockholder, director, employee, advisor, legal
counsel or any other agent, consultant or representative of such Party.

     6.9  ESCROW. Upon notice to the Seller specifying in reasonable detail the
basis therefor and subject to compliance with the procedures for indemnification
set forth in SECTION 6.3, the Buyer may give notice of an Indemnity Claim in
such amount under the Escrow Agreement, and the Buyer shall be entitled to
payment of such amounts from the escrowed funds being held pursuant to such
Escrow Agreement. Giving a notice of an Indemnity Claim under the Escrow
Agreement will not constitute an election of remedies or limit the Buyer in any
manner in the enforcement of any remedies that may be available to it. Subject
to compliance with the indemnification procedures set forth in SECTION 6.3, to
the extent that the Seller is required indemnify a Buyer Indemnified Party for
an Indemnity Claim, payment shall be made to the Buyer Indemnified Party from
amounts held in escrow under the Escrow Agreement until the funds held in escrow
are fully exhausted, it being understood and agreed that, subject to the
applicable Indemnity Cap, Seller's indemnification obligation shall not be
limited to the amounts held in escrow pursuant to the Escrow Agreement.

     6.10 NO RIGHT OF OFFSET. Under no circumstances may Buyer set off or seek
to satisfy all or any part of any Claim that Buyer suffers or incurs in
connection with this Agreement by withholding amounts due under the Earn-Out
Payment.

                                  ARTICLE VII
                                  MISCELLANEOUS

without the prior written approval of the other Party or Parties; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that any Party may make any public disclosure it believes in good faith
is required by Law, regulation or stock exchange rule (in which case the
disclosing Party shall advise the other Party and the other Party shall, if
practicable, have the right to review such press release or announcement prior
to its publication).

its obligations under and shall act in all ways necessary to maintain the Master
Lease in full force and effect throughout the Initial Term.

          5.3  Sublessee shall indemnify, defend and hold Sublessor free and
harmless of and from all liability, judgments, costs, damages, fines, penalties,

                      EXHIBIT F -- FORM OF ESCROW AGREEMENT

     THIS ESCROW AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is made and entered into as of
this 13th day of February, 2003, by and among ACTERNA, LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company ("Seller"), TOLLGRADE COMMUNICATIONS, INC., a Pennsylvania
corporation ("Buyer"), and ALLFIRST TRUST COMPANY NATIONAL ASSOCIATION, a
national association with trust powers ("Escrow Agent"). Capitalized words,
terms and phrases used but not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings
ascribed to such words, terms and phrases in the Purchase and Sale Agreement (as
defined below).

                                   WITNESSETH:

     WHEREAS, pursuant to that certain Purchase and Sale Agreement dated
February 13, 2003, by and between Seller and Buyer (the "Purchase and Sale
Agreement"), Buyer has agreed to purchase from Seller certain assets from and to
assume certain liabilities of Seller; and

     WHEREAS, it is a condition to the consummation of the Purchase and Sale
Agreement that Buyer, Seller and Escrow Agent execute and deliver this
Agreement; and

     WHEREAS, Buyer and Seller desire Escrow Agent to perform certain services
as required pursuant to the consummation of transactions contemplated by the
Purchase and Sale Agreement, and Escrow Agent desires to perform such services,
on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein.

     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing recitals and the
covenants herein contained, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the
parties hereto agree as follows:

                                   AGREEMENT:

     SECTION 1.    ESTABLISHMENT OF ESCROW. (a) Buyer is depositing with Escrow
Agent Five Hundred Thousand U.S. Dollars ($500,000) (such amount, as may be
increased by any earnings thereon and as reduced by any disbursements pursuant
to the terms hereof, is hereinafter referred to as the "Escrow Fund") as part of
the Purchase Price under the Purchase and Sale Agreement. Escrow Agent
acknowledges receipt of the Escrow Fund. The Escrow Fund shall be used, (i) for
the payment of any amounts as to which the Buyer Indemnified Parties (as defined
in Section 6.2 of the Purchase and Sale Agreement) are entitled to
indemnification by Seller upon compliance with the procedures for
indemnification set forth in Section 6.3 through Section 6.5 of the Purchase and
Sale Agreement and subject to the limitations on indemnity set forth in Section
6.6; and (ii) to undertake Purchase Price adjustments described in Section
1.3(a) of the Purchase and Sale Agreement and in accordance with the procedures
set forth therein (collectively, the "Obligations").

          (b)      Escrow Agent hereby agrees to act as the escrow agent under
this Agreement and to hold, safeguard and disburse the Escrow Fund on the terms
and subject to the conditions herein contained. The Escrow Fund and all earnings
thereon shall be held by Escrow Agent in a separate account maintained for the
foregoing purpose, on the terms and subject to the



                                      F-1
<PAGE>

conditions of this Agreement. Amounts held in the Escrow Fund shall not be
available to, and shall not be used by, Escrow Agent to set off any obligations
of any of the parties owing to Escrow Agent in any capacity, except as expressly
provided in this Agreement.

     SECTION 2.    INVESTMENT OF FUNDS. Except as Buyer and Seller may from time
to time jointly instruct Escrow Agent in writing, the Escrow Fund initially
shall be placed in a non-interest-bearing account or accounts and shall
thereafter be invested in ARK Money Market Funds, Corporate Class II, Prime Cash
Management Portfolio, until disbursement of the entire Escrow Fund.

     SECTION 3.    CLAIMS AGAINST THE ESCROW FUND. Upon compliance with the
terms of this Agreement, including, but not limited to, the conditions set forth
in SECTION 1(a)(I) hereof (and the procedures for indemnification set forth in
Section 6.3 through Section 6.5 of the Purchase and Sale Agreement) and SECTION
1(a)(II) hereof (and the procedures for adjustments of the Purchase Price
pursuant to Section 1.3(a) of the Purchase and Sale Agreement), as applicable,
Buyer shall deliver the Certificate of Instruction (as defined below) to Escrow
Agent, and Escrow Agent shall disburse to Buyer amounts from the Escrow Fund (to
the extent thereof) equal to any or all of the unpaid Obligations in accordance
with the procedures set forth below. Subject to the remainder of this SECTION 3,
if, on or before the Release Date (as defined in SECTION 4(a) hereof), a Buyer
Indemnified Party shall have, or reasonably believe it will have, a claim
against the Escrow Fund which such claim relates to an indemnifiable event or
adjustment of the Purchase Price pursuant to the Purchase and Sale Agreement,
the Buyer Indemnified Party shall notify the Escrow Agent and the Seller of its
request for such payment by delivery of a certificate signed by an officer of
the Buyer in substantially the form of EXHIBIT A attached hereto (the
"CERTIFICATE OF INSTRUCTION"). For a period of three (3) business days after the
Escrow Agent's and Seller's receipt of the Certificate of Instruction, the
Seller shall have the opportunity to object to the disbursement of the amounts
from the Escrow Fund by delivery to Escrow Agent and the Buyer Indemnified
Parties of a certificate signed by an officer of Seller in substantially the
form of EXHIBIT B attached hereto (the "CERTIFICATE OF OBJECTION"), certifying
to the Escrow Agent and Buyer Indemnified Parties, within such three (3) day
period, that full and complete curative action (such curative action to include,
but not be limited to, payment of money by Seller) has been taken with respect
to the matter giving rise to the claim against the Escrow Fund, and upon receipt
of the Certificate of Objection, the Escrow Agent shall not disburse any portion
of the Escrow Fund to the Buyer Indemnified Party. If such full and complete
curative action is not complete within the three (3) day period, then Buyer
shall so notify Escrow Agent and Seller by delivery of a certificate signed by
an officer of Buyer in substantially the form of EXHIBIT C attached hereto (the
"CERTIFICATE OF FURTHER INSTRUCTION"), and upon receipt of the Certificate of
Further Instruction, the Escrow Agent shall promptly disburse to the Buyer
Indemnified Party the amount(s) specified in the Certificate of Instruction.

     SECTION 4.    RELEASE OF ESCROW FUND; TERMINATION OF ESCROW. (a) Subject to
the provisions of SECTION 4(b) hereof, on May 13, 2004 (or, if such day is not a
business day, the next succeeding business day) (the "Release Date"), Escrow
Agent shall pay and distribute any and all funds remaining in the Escrow Fund to
Seller.



                                      F-2

<PAGE>

          (b)      The amounts referred to in SECTION 4(A) above shall be paid
unless (i) any Indemnity Claims by a Buyer Indemnified Party are then pending,
in which case an amount equal to the aggregate dollar amount of such claims (as
shown in the notice(s) of such claims) shall be retained by Escrow Agent in the
Escrow Fund; or (ii) Buyer has given notice to Escrow Agent specifying in
reasonable detail the nature of any other Indemnity Claim that Buyer or Buyer
Indemnified Parties may have pursuant to the Purchase and Sale Agreement with
respect to which Buyer is unable to specify the amount of damages, in which case
the entire Escrow Fund shall be retained by Escrow Agent until Buyer is able to
ascertain such damages with reasonable specificity, and when Buyer ascertains
such damages, Buyer shall so notify Seller and Escrow Agent in writing.

     SECTION 5.    DUTIES OF ESCROW AGENT. (a) Escrow Agent shall not be
required to invest any funds held hereunder except as directed in this
Agreement.

          (b)      Escrow Agent shall not be liable hereunder, except for its
own gross negligence or willful misconduct, and except with respect to claims
based upon such gross negligence or willful misconduct that are successfully
asserted against Escrow Agent, the other parties hereto shall indemnify and hold
harmless Escrow Agent (and any successor to Escrow Agent) from and against any
and all losses, liabilities, claims, actions, damages and expenses, including
reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements, arising out of and in connection
with this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, Escrow Agent shall in no
event be liable in connection with its investment or reinvestment of any cash
held by it hereunder in good faith, in accordance with the terms hereof,
including, without limitation, any liability for any delays (not resulting from
its gross negligence or willful misconduct) in the investment or reinvestment of
the Escrow Fund, or any loss of interest incident to any such delays.

          (c)      Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely upon any order,
judgment, certification, demand, notice, instrument or other writing delivered
to it hereunder without being required to determine the authenticity or the
correctness of any fact stated therein or the propriety or validity of the
service thereof. Escrow Agent may act in reliance upon any instrument or
signature believed by it to be genuine and may assume that the person purporting
to give receipt or advice or make any statement or execute any document in
connection with the provisions hereof has been duly authorized to do so. Escrow
Agent may conclusively presume that the undersigned representative of any party
hereto has full power and authority to instruct Escrow Agent on behalf of that
party unless written notice to the contrary is delivered to Escrow Agent.

          (d)      Escrow Agent may act pursuant to the advice of legal counsel
with respect to any matter relating to this Agreement and shall not be liable
for any action taken or omitted by it in good faith in accordance with such
advice.

          (e)      Escrow Agent does not have any interest in the Escrow Fund
but is serving only as escrow holder and only having possession thereof. Any
payments of income from the Escrow Fund shall be subject to withholding
regulations then in force with respect to United States taxes. Buyer and Seller
shall provide Escrow Agent with appropriate Internal Revenue Service Forms W-9
for tax identification number certification.


                                      F-3
<PAGE>

          (f)      Escrow Agent (and any successor to Escrow Agent) may at any
time resign as the escrow agent under this Agreement by delivering the Escrow
Fund to any successor to Escrow Agent jointly designated by the other parties
hereto in writing, or to any court of competent jurisdiction, whereupon Escrow
Agent shall be discharged of and from any and all further obligations arising in
connection with this Agreement. The resignation of Escrow Agent shall take
effect on the appointment of a successor to Escrow Agent (including a court of
competent jurisdiction).

          (g)      In the event of any disagreement between Seller and Buyer
resulting in adverse claims or demands being made in connection with the Escrow
Fund, or in the event that Escrow Agent is in doubt as to what action it should
take hereunder, Escrow Agent shall be entitled to retain the Escrow Fund until
Escrow Agent shall have received (i) a final non-appealable order of a court of
competent jurisdiction directing delivery of the Escrow Fund, or (ii) a written
agreement executed by the other parties hereto directing delivery of the Escrow
Fund, in which events Escrow Agent shall disburse the Escrow Fund in accordance
with such order or agreement. Any court order shall be accompanied by a legal
opinion by legal counsel for the presenting party, reasonably satisfactory to
Escrow Agent, to the effect that the order is final and non-appealable. Escrow
Agent shall act on such court order and legal opinion without further question.

          (h)      Seller and Buyer shall pay Escrow Agent compensation (as
payment in full) for the services to be rendered by Escrow Agent hereunder in
such amounts as are usually and customarily charged by Escrow Agent, and hereby
agree to reimburse Escrow Agent for all reasonable expenses, disbursements and
advances incurred or made by Escrow Agent in the performance of its duties
hereunder (including reasonable fees, expenses and disbursements of its legal
counsel). Any such compensation and reimbursement to which Escrow Agent is
entitled shall be borne one-half (1/2) by Seller and one-half (1/2) by Buyer.

          (i)      No printed or other matter in any language (including,
without limitation, notices, reports and promotional material) that mentions
Escrow Agent's name or the rights, powers, or duties of Escrow Agent shall be
issued by the other parties hereto or on such parties' behalf unless Escrow
Agent shall first have given its specific written consent thereto.

          (j)      The provisions of SECTIONS 5(b) and (e) hereof shall survive
the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement or the resignation or
replacement of Escrow Agent.

     SECTION 6.    LIMITED RESPONSIBILITY. This Agreement expressly sets forth
all the duties of Escrow Agent with respect to any and all matters pertinent
hereto. No implied duties or obligations shall be read into this Agreement
against Escrow Agent. Escrow Agent shall not be bound by the provisions of any
agreement among the other parties hereto except this Agreement.

     SECTION 7.    OWNERSHIP FOR TAX PURPOSES. For purposes of federal and other
taxes based on income, Seller and Buyer shall be treated as each having an
undivided one-half (1/2) interest in the Escrow Fund. Seller and Buyer shall
report all income, if any, that is earned on, or derived from, the Escrow Fund
as their income, in the foregoing proportions, in the taxable year or years in
which such income is properly includible and shall pay any taxes attributable
thereto.

retain all right, title and interest in, to and under their respective

     SECTION 5.6   INJUNCTIVE RELIEF. The Parties acknowledge and agree that a
remedy of damages may be inadequate to protect the interests of the Parties in
their respective Confidential Information in the event of breach or threatened
breach of this ARTICLE 5. Accordingly, each Party acknowledges the availability
and propriety of injunctive or other equitable relief to either Party with
respect to any Confidential Information disclosed hereunder, in addition to any

prevailing Party in any action or proceeding to interpret or enforce the rights

or observe any term, obligation, covenant, provision or condition of this
Agreement, then, upon reasonable notice and an opportunity to cure, the

Agreement; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that this SECTION 6.2 shall not affect the
immediate availability of the injunctive or other equitable relief set forth in
SECTION 5.6 hereof in the event of breach or threatened breach of the provisions
of ARTICLE 5 hereof. Without limitation of the foregoing, either Party shall
also have the right to terminate this Agreement immediately upon the occurrence
of (a) a breach by either Party of the non-disclosure obligations hereunder and

     assignment by either Party for the benefit of its creditors; the
     appointment of a receiver for either Party; or any other proceeding
     involving insolvency or the protection of or from creditors (an "Insolvency
     Event"); and (ii) in each such case, (A) such Insolvency Event causes a
     Party to commit a material breach of a material provision under this
     Agreement, and (B) such breach cannot be cured within 45 days; or

          (c) if either Party has ceased its on-going business operations, or
     the sale, licensing, maintenance or other support of the Tollgrade Products
     or the Company Products; or

          (d) if either Party refuses to provide written confirmation of its
     intent to perform, upon written request from the other Party.

     Upon the occurrence of an Escrow Release Event, the non-breaching Party
shall give written notice by certified mail to the Escrow Agent and the other
Party of the occurrence of an

Escrow Release Event hereunder. Unless, within fifteen (15) days thereafter, the
breaching Party files with the Escrow Agent its affidavit executed by an
executive officer clearly refuting each area of claimed Escrow Release Event or
showing that the Escrow Release Event has been cured, then Escrow Agent shall
upon the sixteenth (16th) day deliver to the non-breaching Party the Escrow
Material and all revisions and additions thereto. Should the Parties disagree on
whether an Escrow Release Event has occurred, the disagreement shall be decided
immediately by arbitration in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in accordance with the
commercial rules of the American Arbitration Association. The award of the
arbitrator shall be final and binding and may be entered as a judgment in any
court of competent jurisdiction.

     SECTION 7.4   USE OF ESCROW MATERIALS. In the event of a release of the
Escrow Materials pursuant to SECTION 7.3 above, the non-breaching Party shall
use the breaching Party's Escrow Material solely for the purpose of maintaining,
developing, producing, marketing, selling and supporting versions of (a) the
Tollgrade Products that are interoperable with the Company Products (if Company
is the breaching Party); or (b) the Company Products that are interoperable with
the Tollgrade Products (if Tollgrade is the breaching Party). In all events,
each Party, or its successors or assigns, shall remain the owner of the Escrow
Material. Each Party's right to use the Escrow Materials shall be that of a
non-exclusive licensee only.

     SECTION 7.5   FEES OF ESCROW AGENT. All fees of the Escrow Agent shall be
borne equally by the Parties.

     SECTION 7.6   TESTING. Each Party may, upon written request to the other
Party and the Escrow Agent, conduct tests of the other Party's Escrow Material,
under the non-requesting Party's supervision and at the Escrow Agent's location,
to confirm the conditions of the Escrow Material. Any direct costs associated
with the testing of the Escrow Material, including direct expenses of the
non-requesting Party, shall be borne by the requesting Party.

     SECTION 9.1   ASSIGNABILITY. Neither this Agreement nor any other rights or
obligations of either Party hereunder may be assigned, delegated, sublicensed,
or otherwise transferred (by asset sale, stock sale, merger, consolidation, or
any other means of transfer whether by operation of law or otherwise) by either
Party to any other party, including, without limitation, any parent, subsidiary,
affiliate or successor, or any other party related directly or indirectly to
said Party, without the prior written consent of the other Party hereto.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event either Party enters into a
transaction that transfers or conveys to a third party (by asset sale, stock
sale, merger, consolidation, or any other means of transfer whether by operation
of law or otherwise) ownership rights to one or more of the products in the line
of Company Products or the line of the Tollgrade Products, the transferring
Party shall be required to assign this Agreement and all rights and obligations
hereunder to such successor third party unless the non-transferring Party
provides written notice specifically prohibiting the other Party from assigning
this Agreement to such third party.

             EXHIBIT I - FORM OF OPINION OF SELLER'S GENERAL COUNSEL




     February 13, 2003


     Tollgrade Communications, Inc.
     493 Nixon Road
     Cheswick, PA  15024


RE:  Purchase and Sale Agreement by and between Acterna, LLC and Tollgrade
     Communications, Inc. and Related Transactions

     Ladies and Gentlemen:

     I am the General Counsel of Acterna Corporation and have advised Acterna,
LLC (the "Seller"), Acterna Corporation's wholly owned subsidiary, in connection
with the preparation, execution and delivery of that certain Purchase and Sale
Agreement dated of even date herewith (the "Acquisition Agreement") by and
between the Seller and Tollgrade Communications, Inc. (the "Buyer"). This
opinion letter ("Opinion Letter") is being delivered to the Buyer pursuant to
Section 1.5(b)(xiv)(D) of the Acquisition Agreement.

     In so acting, I, or attorneys under my supervision, have examined such
originals or copies of:

          (a) the Acquisition Agreement;

          (b) the Interoperability Agreement between the Seller and the Buyer
dated February 13, 2003;

          (c) the Assignment and Assumption Agreement between the Seller and the
Buyer dated February 13, 2003;

          (d) the Sublease Agreement between the Seller and the Buyer, dated
February 13, 2003;

          (e) the Escrow Agreement between the Seller, the Buyer and Allfirst
Trust Company, National Association, as Escrow Agent, dated February 13, 2003;
and

          (f) the Bill of Sale of the Seller dated February 13, 2003.

     The items listed in (b) through (f) are referred to herein as the
"Ancillary Agreements". In addition, I or attorneys acting under my supervision,
have examined originals


                                      I-1

<PAGE>

or copies of such statutes, corporate records and other documents, opinions and
instruments and have made such other investigations as I have deemed necessary
in connection with the opinions hereinafter set forth. Capitalized terms used in
this Opinion Letter that are not otherwise defined herein shall have the
meanings assigned to them in the Acquisition Agreement.

     Subject to the qualifications set forth in this Opinion Letter, I express
the following opinions:

     1.   The Seller is a limited liability company duly formed and presently
subsisting under the laws of the State of Delaware.

     2.   The Seller has the full power and authority to (a) carry on the
Business as it is now being conducted; and (b) execute, deliver and perform the
Acquisition Agreement and each of the Ancillary Agreements.

     3.   The Seller has taken all actions necessary to authorize the execution,
delivery and performance of the Acquisition Agreement and each of the Ancillary
Agreements and has duly executed and delivered each of them.

     4.   The Acquisition Agreement and each of the Ancillary Agreements are
legal, valid and binding obligations of the Seller, enforceable against the
Seller in accordance with their respective terms, except to the extent that
enforceability may be limited by general principles of equity (regardless of
whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law),
including, without limitation, concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good
faith and fair dealing.

     5.   Except as specifically disclosed in the Disclosure Schedules to the
Acquisition Agreement, the execution and delivery by the Seller of the
Acquisition Agreement and each of the Ancillary Agreements do not, and the
performance by the Seller of its obligations thereunder will not require the
approval of, or filing with, any third party, including, but not limited to, any
of Seller's lenders or any governmental authority, or any law (including any
rule or regulation thereunder) of any governmental authority. As used in this
Opinion Letter, the term "governmental authority" means any legislative,
judicial, administrative or regulatory body of the United States or the states
in which the Business is or should be qualified to do business.

     6.   The execution and delivery by the Seller of the Acquisition Agreement
and each of the Ancillary Agreements do not, and the performance by the Seller
of its obligations thereunder will not (a) result in a violation of the
Certificate of Organization, operating agreement, or any other organizational
document of the Seller, or (b) constitute a breach of or result in a default
under any of the Assigned Contracts or any other agreement or instrument to
which the Seller is a party or by which the Seller or any of the Acquired Assets
are bound.

     7.   During the course of my representation of the Seller in connection
with the transactions contemplated by the Acquisition Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements, nothing has come to my attention which would lead me to

possibility of any judgment, order or decision which might materially impair the
ability of Seller to perform the Acquisition Agreement or any of the Ancillary
Agreements or might materially adversely affect the normal operation of the
Business or might result in liability for material damages or might have a
material adverse effect on the right, title or interest of the Seller in or to
the Acquired Assets.

     This Opinion Letter and the opinions set forth herein are intended solely
for the Buyer in connection with the transactions contemplated by the
Acquisition Agreement, and may not be relied upon or used by any other person or
for any other purpose without my prior written consent. No part of this Opinion
Letter or the opinions set forth herein may be incorporated, quoted or otherwise
referred to in any other document or communication or filed with or otherwise
furnished to any third party.

     In conducting my examination, I have assumed the genuineness of all
signatures, the legal capacity of all individual signatories, the accuracy of
all documents submitted to me as originals and the conformity to originals of
all documents submitted to me as certified, reproduced or facsimile copies. I
have also assumed the due authorization, execution and delivery of the
Acquisition Agreement and each Ancillary Agreement and the other documents that
I examined by the parties signing them, other than the Seller.

     I express no opinion regarding the Acquisition Agreement or any Ancillary
Agreement or any right, power, privilege, remedy or interest intended to be
created thereunder, insofar as: (a) any of the rights, powers, privileges,
remedies and interests of a party thereunder may be limited (i) by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization or other similar
laws affecting the rights, powers and remedies of creditors generally, (ii) by
rules or principles of equity affecting the enforcement of obligations
generally, whether at law, in equity or otherwise, or (iii) by the exercise of
discretionary or equitable powers of any court or other authority before which
may be brought any proceeding seeking equitable or other remedies, including
(without limitation) specific performance, injunctive relief, indemnification
and contribution; (b) the rights, powers, privileges, remedies and interests of
any party under the Acquisition Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement or
applicable law may be exercised or otherwise enforced in bad faith or a
commercially unreasonable manner; and (c) any term or provision of any
Transaction Document provides for an absolute and unconditional obligation to
perform under such the Acquisition Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement even
though such agreement is terminated or if performance thereunder would
constitute a penalty.

     I am licensed to practice law only in the State of Wisconsin and do not
hold myself out to be an expert on the laws of any other jurisdiction other than
the State of State of Wisconsin and the Federal law of the United States of
America. My opinions expressed herein are limited to the laws of the State of
Wisconsin, the general corporate laws of the State of Delaware and the federal
law of the United States of America that in my experience are normally
applicable to transactions of the type.

     This Opinion is limited to the matters expressly set forth herein and no
opinion should be inferred as to any other matters. In addition, this Opinion is
issued on, and limited to,
