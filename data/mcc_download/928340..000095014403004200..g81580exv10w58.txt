                           DesalCo in preventing the installation, use or resale
                           of such Products in the Territory.

         2.8      DWEER-Tech shall not have any right or remedy against DesalCo
                  if any Product is sold, installed or used outside the
                  Territory by any person to whom DesalCo or its Affiliates have
                  supplied Products, provided that DesalCo can show that it has
                  obtained the written undertaking required by clause 2.3(e)
                  above and further provided that DesalCo shall, at the request
                  and expense of DWEER-Tech, take all such steps as DWEER-Tech
                  may reasonably require to assist DWEER-Tech in preventing the
                  installation, use or resale of such Products outside the
                  Territory.

3.       SUPPLY OF PRODUCTS

         3.1      DWEER-Tech shall use its reasonable endeavours to supply the
                  Products to DesalCo in accordance with DesalCo's orders from
                  time to time and to deliver the same in accordance with
                  DesalCo's directions.

         3.2      DWEER-Tech shall not be under any obligation to continue the
                  manufacture of all or any of the Products, and shall be
                  entitled to make such alterations to the specifications of the
                  Products as it may think fit from time to time and may, as it
                  thinks fit from time to time, change, amend or replace any
                  trademark used in relation to the Products (including, without
                  limitation, the Trade Marks).

         3.3      The prices for each order of Products to be supplied under
                  this Agreement shall be at least as good as and shall not be
                  more than the lowest price charged by DWEER-Tech for
                  comparable orders of Products by other persons.

         3.4      Each order for Products by DesalCo shall be in writing and
                  shall constitute a separate contract and payment for such
                  Products shall be made by DesalCo without deduction or
                  set-off. The standard terms and conditions of sale of
                  DWEER-Tech from time to time shall apply to all sales of the
                  Products to DesalCo except to the extent that any of the same
                  is inconsistent with any of the provisions of this Agreement,
                  in which case the latter shall prevail, and subject to any
                  modifications thereto agreed to in writing between DesalCo and
                  DWEER-Tech.

         3.5      Prior to acceptance of an order, DesalCo shall provide
                  DWEER-Tech with comprehensive accurate drawings and plans
                  showing the manner in which Products will be incorporated into
                  and installed in the relevant desalination plant. DesalCo
                  shall give due regard to any observations or comments made by
                  DWEER-Tech in relation thereto provided that DWEER-Tech shall
                  not thereby incur any liability to DesalCo. DWEER-Tech's
                  observations and comments shall be limited to compatibility of
                  the Products with the relevant desalination plant. Save as
                  agreed in writing by DWEER-Tech, DWEER-Tech shall not be
                  liable or responsible for the design, operation or functioning
                  of any desalination plants.

4.       MARKETING AND USE OF THE PRODUCTS

         4.1      DesalCo shall use its best endeavours to promote the sale and
                  use of the Products throughout the Territory and to satisfy
                  market demand therefor.

         4.2      DesalCo shall be entitled, subject to the terms of this
                  Agreement, to promote and market the Products in the Territory
                  in such manner as it may think fit, and in particular shall be
                  entitled to resell the Products to its customers on such terms
                  and at such prices as it may determine.

         4.3      DesalCo shall maintain such stocks of parts for the Products
                  as may be necessary to meet its customers' requirements.

         4.4      In connection with the promotion, marketing and the sale of
                  the Products, DesalCo shall:

                  (a)      make clear, in all dealings with its customers and
                           prospective customers, that it is acting as
                           distributor of the Products and not as agent of
                           DWEER-Tech;

                  (b)      comply with all legal requirements from time to time
                           in force relating to the storage and sale of the
                           Products;

                  (c)      use only such advertising, promotional, and selling
                           materials as are approved in writing by DWEER-Tech;

                  (d)      provide an after sale service for customers in
                           relation to the Products on terms to be agreed from
                           time to time between DesalCo and DWEER-Tech; and

                  (e)      advise DWEER-Tech of projected sales of Products as
                           early as reasonably possible.

         4.5      DWEER-Tech shall, from time to time, provide DesalCo with such
                  samples, catalogues, brochures, and up to date information
                  concerning the Products as DWEER-Tech may consider reasonably
                  appropriate in connection with the sale of the Products in the
                  Territory, and DWEER-Tech shall endeavour to answer as soon as
                  practicable any technical enquiries concerning the Products
                  which are made by DesalCo or its customers.

         4.6      DesalCo shall use its best endeavours to enable DWEER-Tech to
                  conduct testing and experimentation of Products on plants
                  owned or operated by DesalCo or its Affiliates at which
                  Products are installed provided that DWEER-Tech shall
                  indemnify and save harmless DesalCo from any costs, expenses,
                  loss or damage, of whatever type and howsoever caused arising
                  from or relating to such tests or experiments.

5.       INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

         5.1      DWEER-Tech hereby authorises DesalCo to use the Trade Marks in
                  the Territory on or in relation to the Products for the
                  purposes only of exercising its rights in performing its
                  obligations under this Agreement and DWEER-Tech shall not so
                  authorise any other person, firm or company provided that
                  DWEER-Tech may prohibit by notice in writing to DesalCo any
                  particular use of the Trade Marks which in the opinion of
                  DWEER-Tech damages the goodwill of DWEER-Tech in such Trade
                  Marks.

         5.2      DesalCo shall ensure that each reference to and use of any of
                  the Trade Marks by DesalCo is in a manner, from time to time,
                  approved by DWEER-Tech and, if requested, accompanied by an
                  acknowledgement, in a form approved by DWEER-Tech, that the
                  same is a trade mark (or registered trade mark as the case may
                  be) of DWEER-Tech.

         5.3      DesalCo shall not:

                  (a)      make any unauthorised modifications to the Products;

                  (b)      alter, remove, or tamper with any Trade Marks,
                           numbers or other means of identification used on or
                           in relation to the Products;

                  (c)      use any of the Trade Marks in any way that might
                           prejudice their distinctiveness or validity;

                  (d)      use in relation to the Products any trade marks other
                           than the Trade Marks without first obtaining the
                           prior written consent of DWEER-Tech; or

                  (e)      use in the Territory any trade marks or trade names
                           so resembling any Trade Marks or the trade names of
                           DWEER-Tech as to be likely to cause confusion or
                           deception.

         5.4      Except as provided in clause 5.1, DesalCo shall have no rights
                  in relation to any of the Trade Marks or the goodwill
                  associated therewith, and DesalCo hereby acknowledges that,
                  except as expressly provided in this Agreement, it shall not
                  acquire any rights in respect thereof and that all such rights
                  and goodwill are, and shall remain, vested in DWEER-Tech, and
                  that all rights and benefits arising from the use of the Trade
                  Marks by DesalCo shall accrue to and be for the benefit of
                  DWEER-Tech.

         5.5      DesalCo shall, at the request and expense of DWEER-Tech, take
                  all such reasonable steps as DWEER-Tech may reasonably require
                  to assist DWEER-Tech in maintaining the validity and
                  enforceability of any DWEER Intellectual Property during the
                  term of this Agreement.

         5.6      DesalCo shall, at the request and expense of DWEER-Tech,
                  execute such agreements or licences in respect of the use of
                  the Trade Marks in the Territory as DWEER-Tech may reasonably
                  require, provided that the provisions thereof shall not be
                  more onerous or restrictive than the provisions of this
                  Agreement.

         5.7      DesalCo shall not, during the term of this Agreement,
                  challenge the validity of any DWEER Intellectual Property.

         5.8      DesalCo shall not do or authorise any third party to do any
                  act which would or might invalidate or be inconsistent with
                  any DWEER Intellectual Property and shall not omit or
                  authorise any third party to omit to do any act which, by its
                  omission, would have that effect or character.

         5.9      DesalCo shall promptly and fully notify DWEER-Tech of any
                  actual threatened or suspected infringement in the Territory
                  of any DWEER Intellectual Property which comes to DesalCo's
                  notice, and of any claim by any third party so coming to its
                  notice that the importation of the Products into the
                  Territory, or their sale therein, infringes any rights of any
                  other person, and DesalCo shall at the request and expense of
                  DWEER-Tech do all such things as may be reasonably required to
                  assist DWEER-Tech in taking or resisting any proceedings in
                  relation to any such infringement or claim.

6.       CONFIDENTIALITY

         6.1      Except as provided by clauses 6.3 and 6.4 below, DesalCo and
                  any Affiliate thereof shall at all times during the
                  continuance of this Agreement and thereafter:

                  (a)      use its best endeavours to keep all Restricted
                           Information (as defined below) confidential and
                           accordingly shall not disclose any Restricted
                           Information to any other person; and

                  (b)      not use any Restricted Information for any purpose
                           other than the performance of its obligations under
                           this Agreement.

         6.2      "Restricted Information" means any information:

                  (a)      which is disclosed to DesalCo by DWEER-Tech pursuant
                           to or in connection with this Agreement (whether
                           orally or in writing); or

                  (b)      which relates to the Products and which comes into
                           the knowledge, possession or control of DesalCo
                           pursuant to this Agreement;

                  regardless of whether or not such information is expressly
                  stated to be confidential or marked as such.

         6.3      Notwithstanding clauses 6.1 and 6.2 above, any Restricted
                  Information may be disclosed by DesalCo to:

                  (a)      any customers or prospective customers;

                  (b)      any governmental or other authority or regulatory
                           body;

                  (c)      any employees or Affiliates of DesalCo;

                           to the extent only as is required for the purposes
                           contemplated by this Agreement, or as is required by
                           law and subject in each case to DesalCo using its
                           best endeavours to ensure that the person in question
                           keeps the same confidential and does not use the same
                           except for the purposes for which the disclosure is
                           made.

         6.4      Any Restricted Information may be used by DesalCo or its
                  Affiliates for any purpose, or disclosed by DesalCo to any
                  other person, to the extent only that it is, at the date
                  hereof, or hereafter, is or becomes public knowledge through


                                       11
<PAGE>


                  no fault of DesalCo or its Affiliates (provided that in doing
                  so DesalCo and its Affiliates shall not disclose any
                  Restricted Information which is not public knowledge).

         6.5      Any press releases, learned papers or similar publications
                  made by DWEER-Tech or Dr. William T. Andrews that make
                  reference to DesalCo or its Affiliates or plants owned or
                  operated by DesalCo or its Affiliates shall be approved in
                  advance by DesalCo provided that such approval shall not be
                  unreasonably withheld and shall be given in a sufficiently
                  timely manner.

7.       REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND LIABILITY

         7.1      Subject as herein provided DWEER-Tech warrants to DesalCo
                  that:

                  (a)      all the Products supplied hereunder shall be of
                           satisfactory quality and shall comply with any legal
                           or other specification, agreed for them;

                  (b)      it is not aware of any rights of any third party in
                           the Territory which would or might render the sale of
                           the Products, or the use of any of the Trade Marks on
                           or in relation to the Products, unlawful.

         7.2      In the event of any breach of DWEER-Tech's warranty in clause
                  7.1 above (whether by reason of defective materials,
                  production faults or otherwise) DWEER-Tech's liability shall
                  be limited to:

                  (a)      replacement of the Products in question; or

                  (b)      at DWEER-Tech's option, repayment of the purchase
                           price therefor (where this has been paid).

         7.3      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
                  DWEER-Tech shall not be liable to DesalCo by reason of any
                  representation or implied warranty, condition or other term or
                  any duty at common law, or under the express terms of this
                  Agreement, for any consequential loss or damage (whether for
                  loss of profit or otherwise and whether occasioned by the
                  negligence of DWEER-Tech or its employees or agents or
                  otherwise) arising out of or in connection with any act or
                  omission of DWEER-Tech relating to the manufacture or supply
                  of the Products, their resale by DesalCo or their use by any
                  customer.

         7.4      Each party hereto represents and warrants to the other that:


                                       12

                  (a)      It is a validly existing company in good standing
                           under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation
                           and is duly qualified as necessary to carry on its
                           business in the jurisdictions in which such business
                           is carried on; and

                  (b)      this Agreement has been duly authorised, executed and
                           delivered by it and is a valid and legally binding
                           obligation of it enforceable in accordance with its
                           terms.

8.       FORCE MAJEURE

         8.1      If either party's performance of this Agreement is affected by
                  Force Majeure (as defined below) it shall forthwith notify the
                  other party of the nature and extent thereof.

         8.2      Neither party shall be held to be in breach of this Agreement,
                  or otherwise be liable to the other, by reason of any delay in
                  its performance, or non performance, of any of its obligations
                  under this Agreement to the extent that such delay or non
                  performance is due to Force Majeure of which it is notified to
                  the other party, and the time for performance of such
                  obligations shall be extended accordingly.

         8.3      If the Force Majeure in question prevails for a continuous
                  period in excess of 180 days, the parties shall enter into
                  bona fide negotiations with a view to alleviating its effects,
                  or to agreeing such alternative arrangements as may be fair
                  and reasonable, and if no agreement is reached between the
                  parties with respect thereto within 30 days, then either party
                  may upon giving written notice to the other, terminate this
                  Agreement without prejudice to any rights, remedies or
                  obligations which have accrued prior to termination.

         8.4      "Force Majeure" means, in relation to either party, any
                  circumstances beyond the reasonable control of that party
                  (including, without limitation, acts of god, war, strike, lock
                  out, go slow, work to rule or other form of industrial action,
                  fire, flood, civil disturbance, or government intervention or
                  government failure to act).

                  (a)      DesalCo fails to diligently promote the sale of and
                           the use of the Products throughout the Territory
                           provided that DesalCo does not have to offer to sell
                           or sell the Products to competitors that are bidding
                           in connection with the construction or expansion of
                           desalination projects in the Territory in connection
                           with which DesalCo or any of its Affiliates is also
                           bidding (but DesalCo may do so at its sole and
                           absolute discretion); or

                  (b)      DesalCo at any time challenges the validity of all of
                           any of the DWEER Intellectual Property;


                  provided that DesalCo fails to remedy the same within 30 days
                  after receipt of written notice giving full particulars of the
                  breach and requiring it to be remedied.

         9.3      DesalCo may, at any time, terminate this Agreement upon one
                  (1) month's prior written notice to DWEER-Tech.

         9.4      Either party shall be entitled forthwith to terminate this
                  Agreement by written notice to the other (subject to clause
                  3.4 above) if:

                  (a)      that other party commits any material breach of any
                           of the provisions of this Agreement and, in the case
                           of a breach capable of remedy, fails to remedy the
                           same within 30 days after receipt of a written notice
                           giving full particulars of the breach and requiring
                           it to be remedied;

                  (b)      an encumbrancer takes possession or a receiver is
                           appointed over any of the property or assets of that
                           other party;

                  (c)      that other party makes any voluntary arrangement with
                           its creditors or goes into winding up or liquidation
                           (except for the purposes of amalgamation or
                           reconstruction and in such manner that the company
                           resulting therefrom effectively agrees to be bound by
                           or assume the obligations imposed on that other party
                           under this Agreement);

<PAGE>

                  (d)      anything analogous to any of the foregoing under the
                           law of any jurisdiction occurs in relation to that
                           other party; or

                  (e)      that other party ceases, or threatens to cease, to
                           carry on business.

         9.5      For the purposes of clause 9.4 above, a breach shall be
                  considered capable of remedy if the party in breach can comply
                  with the provision in question in all respects other than as
                  to the time of performance (provided that time of performance
                  is not of the essence).

         9.6      Any waiver by either party of a breach of any provision of
                  this Agreement shall not be considered as a waiver of any
                  subsequent breach of the same or any other provision thereof.

         9.7      The rights to terminate this Agreement given by this clause 9
                  shall be without prejudice to any other right or remedy of
                  either party in respect of the breach concerned (if any) or
                  any other breach.

10.      CONSEQUENCE OF TERMINATION OR EXPIRATION

         10.1     the terms of this Agreement shall continue in full force for
                  so long as is required and to the extent and insofar as is
                  necessary to allow DesalCo to complete any binding contracts
                  for the sale of the Products in effect at the date of
                  termination and any bids, offers, quotations and/or proposals
                  made by DesalCo to other persons prior to termination of this
                  Agreement which have been accepted before termination of this
                  Agreement or are capable of being accepted after termination
                  of this Agreement provided that, for the avoidance of doubt
                  and notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of clauses
                  2.1, 2.2 and 2.5 above shall cease to apply forthwith upon
                  termination of this Agreement;

         10.2     DesalCo shall cease to promote, market or advertise the
                  Products or to make any use of the Trade Marks other than for

                  Products and for such purpose only and to such extent the
                  provisions of this Agreement shall continue in full force and
                  effect;

         10.3     the provisions of clause 6, and any other clauses which are
                  intended to survive the termination of this Agreement, shall
                  continue in force in accordance with their respective terms
                  notwithstanding termination of this Agreement;

         10.4     DesalCo shall have no claim against DWEER-Tech for
                  compensation for loss of distribution rights, loss of goodwill
                  or any similar loss;

         10.5     subject to as otherwise provided herein and to any rights,
                  remedies or obligations which have accrued prior to
                  termination, neither party shall have any further obligation
                  to the other under this Agreement.

11.      MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

                  aforesaid and the assignee shall assume and acquire
