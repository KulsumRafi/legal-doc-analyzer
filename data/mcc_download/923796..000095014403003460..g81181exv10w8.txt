such period.)

         6.10 TERMINATION OF SERVICE ON BOARD FOR OTHER REASONS

         If the service of the Participant on the Board shall terminate for any
reason other than for death or Disability, any outstanding Options held by the
Participant shall remain exercisable at any time prior to their expiration date,
or for ten years from the date of the grant of the Options.

         6.11 NONTRANSFERABILITY OF OPTIONS

         No Option granted under this Plan may be sold, transferred, pledged,

in whole or in part. However, no amendment which fails to comply with the
exemptions available under Rule 16b-3 of the Exchange Act, including any
successor to the Rule, shall be effective.

         7.2 OPTIONS PREVIOUSLY GRANTED

         Unless required by law, no termination, amendment, or modification of
this Plan shall in any manner adversely affect any Option previously granted
under this Plan, without the written consent of the Participant holding the
Option.

                          ARTICLE VIII. MISCELLANEOUS

losses, damages, and expenses (including counsel fees) incurred by such
individual for the exercise of any duties as Plan Administrator, whether singly
or as a member of committee, and against any liability, including any amounts
paid in settlement with the Company's approval, arising from the individual's
action or failure to act, except when the same is judicially determined to be
attributable to the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the individual.

         8.2 BENEFICIARY DESIGNATION

         Each Participant under this Plan may, from time to time, name any
beneficiary or beneficiaries (who may be named contingently or successively) to

lifetime. In the absence of any such designation, such rights may be exercised
by the executor of the Participant's estate.

         8.3 SUCCESSORS

         All obligations of the Company under this Plan, with respect to Options
granted hereunder, shall be binding on any successor to the Company, whether the

<PAGE>

merger, consolidation, or otherwise, of all or substantially all of the business
and/or assets of the Company.

         8.4 SEVERABILITY

         If a provision of this Plan shall be held illegal or invalid, the
illegality or invalidity shall not affect the remaining parts of the Plan. The
Plan shall be construed and enforced as if the illegal or invalid provision had
not been included herein.

         8.5 REQUIREMENTS OF LAW

         The granting of Options under this Plan shall be subject to all
applicable laws, rules, and regulations, and to such approvals by any
governmental agencies or national securities exchanges as may be required.

         8.6 GOVERNING LAW

         To the extent not preempted by Federal law, this Plan, and all Award
Agreements hereunder, shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the
State of Florida.

this document and have affixed the corporate seal on _______________, 1996, but
