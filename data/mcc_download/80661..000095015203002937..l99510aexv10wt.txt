<PAGE>

      In addition, the terms "Change in Control," "Potential Change in Control"
and "Change in Control Price" shall have meanings set forth, respectively, in
Sections 4(b), (c) and (d) below.

SECTION 2. STOCK SUBJECT TO THE PLAN.

      (a) Aggregate Stock Subject to the Plan. Subject to adjustment as provided
below in Section 2(c), the total number of shares of Stock reserved and
available for Awards under the Plan is 150,000. Any Stock issued hereunder may
consist, in whole or in part, of authorized and unissued shares or treasury
shares.

      (b) Forfeiture or Termination of Awards of Stock. If any Stock subject to
any Award granted hereunder is forfeited or an Award otherwise terminates or
expires without the issuance of Stock, the Stock subject to such Award shall
again be available for distribution in connection with future Awards under the
Plan as set forth in Section 2(a).

      (c) Adjustment.

            (1) If the Company (i) pays a dividend or makes a distribution in
shares of Stock, (ii) subdivides or splits its outstanding Stock into a greater
number of shares, or (iii) combines its outstanding Stock into a smaller number
of shares, the aggregate number of shares of Stock reserved for issuance
pursuant to the Plan and the number and option price of shares of Stock subject
to outstanding Options granted pursuant to the Plan immediately prior thereto
shall be adjusted so that, assuming that Options had been previously granted for
all of the shares of Stock so reserved, the participants would be entitled to
receive for the same aggregate price that number of shares of Stock which they
would have owned after the happening of any of the events described above had
they exercised all of such Options prior to the happening of such event. An
adjustment made pursuant to this Section 2(c)(1) shall become effective
immediately after the record date in the case of a dividend or distribution and
shall become effective immediately after the effective date in the case of a
subdivision or combination.

            (2) If the Company reclassifies or changes the Stock (except for
splitting or combining, or changing par value, or changing from par value to no
par value, or changing from no par value to par value) or participates in a
consolidation or merger (other than a merger in which the Company is the
surviving corporation and which does not result in any reclassification or
change of theStock except as stated above), the aggregate number of shares of
Stock reserved for issuance pursuant to the Plan and the number and option price
of shares of Stock subject to outstanding Options granted pursuant to the Plan
immediately prior thereto shall be adjusted so that, assuming that Options had
been previously granted for all the shares of Stock so reserved, the
participants would be entitled to receive for the same aggregate price that
number and type of shares of capital stock which they would have owned after the
happening of any of the events described above had they exercised all of such
Options prior to the happening of such event.

      (3) No adjustment pursuant to this Section 2(c) shall be required unless
such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least 1% in such
number or price; provided, however, that any adjustments which by reason of this
Section 2(c)(3) are not required to be made shall be carried forward and taken
into account in any subsequent adjustment. All calculations under this Section
2(c) shall be made to the nearest cent or to the nearest full share, as the case
may be. Anything in this Section 2(c) to the contrary notwithstanding, the
Company shall be entitled to make such reductions in the option price, in
addition to those required by this Section 2(c), as it in its discretion shall
determine to be advisable in order that any stock dividends or distributions,
subdivisions or splits of shares, distribution of rights to purchase stock or
securities, or a distribution of securities convertible into or exchangeable for
stock hereafter made by the Company to its stockholders shall not be taxable.

<PAGE>

      (4) Whenever an adjustment is made pursuant to this Section 2(c), the
Company shall promptly prepare a notice of such adjustment setting forth the
terms of such adjustment and the date on which such adjustment becomes effective
and shall mail such notice of such adjustment to the participants at their
respective addresses appearing on the records of the Company or at such other
address as any participant may from time to time designate in writing to the
Company.

SECTION 3. STOCK OPTIONS.

      (a) Grant and Eligibility. All directors of the Company who are not full
time employees of the Company are eligible to be granted Awards under the Plan.
Promptly following each annual meeting of the shareholders of the Company on or
after the effective date of the Plan, each person who is then a director of the
Company and not a full time employee of the Company shall receive an Option to
purchase 2,000 shares of Stock.

      (b) Terms and Conditions. Options granted under the Plan shall be
evidenced by option agreements, and shall be subject to the following terms and
conditions:

            (1) Option Price. The option price per share of Stock purchasable
under a Stock Option shall be the Fair Market Value of the Stock on the day of
the annual meeting of shareholders coinciding with the date of grant, or, if the
date of grant does not coincide with the day of an annual meeting of
shareholders, then the option price per share of Stock purchasable under the
Stock Option shall be the Fair Market Value of the Stock on the day of the
annual meeting of shareholders immediately preceding the date of grant.

            (2) Option Term. Subject to Section 3(b)(6), the term of each Stock
Option shall commence as of the date such Stock Option is granted and shall
terminate on the tenth anniversary thereof.

            (3) Exercise. Subject to Section 3(b)(6), each Stock Option shall
become exercisable on the date which is six months and one day after the date on
which such Stock Option is granted and shall thereafter be exercisable during
the remaining term of such Stock Option, as specified in Section 3(b)(2).

            (4) Method of Exercise. When exercisable in accordance with Section
3(b)(3), Stock Options may be exercised, in whole or in part, by giving written
notice of exercise to the Company specifying the number of shares of Stock to be
purchased.

                  Such notice shall be accompanied by payment in full of the
option price of the shares of Stock for which the Option is then being
exercised, in cash or by check or such other instrument as the Company may
accept. Subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, payment, in full or in part, of the option price may be
made in the form of unrestricted Stock then owned by the participant or Stock
that is issuable upon the exercise of such Option. The value of each such share
of Stock surrendered shall be 100% of the Fair Market Value of the Stock on the
date the Option is exercised.

                  No Stock shall be issued pursuant to an exercise of an Option
until full payment has been made. A participant shall not have rights to
dividends or any other rights of a shareholder with respect to any Stock subject
to an Option unless and until the participant has given written notice of
exercise, has paid in full for such shares, has given, if requested, the
representations described in Section 7(a) and such shares have been issued to
him.

<PAGE>

            (5) Non-Transferability of Options. No Stock Option shall be
transferable by the participant. All Stock Options shall be exercisable only by
the participant, by the Participant's estate (as provided in Section 3(b)(6)) or
by the participant's authorized legal representative if the participant is
unable to exercise an Option as a result of the participant's Disability.

            (6) Death of Participant. If any participant dies while holding
unexercised Stock Options, any Stock Option held by such participant at the time
of his or her death may thereafter be exercised, to the extent such Option was
exercisable at the time of death, by the estate of the participant (acting
through its fiduciary), for a period of one year from the date of such death
regardless of the term of the Stock Option remaining at the director's death.

      (c) Buyout Provisions. The Company may at any time buy out, for a payment
in cash or Stock, an Option previously granted, based on such terms and
conditions as the Company shall establish and agree upon with the participant,
provided that no such transaction shall be structured in a manner that would
violate, or result in any liability on the part of the participant under,
Section 16 of the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder.

SECTION 4. CHANGE IN CONTROL PROVISIONS.

      (a) Impact of Event. In the event of: (1) a "Change in Control" as defined
in Section 4(b), or (2) a "Potential Change in Control" as defined in Section
4(c), the value of all outstanding Awards shall be cashed out on the basis of
the "Change in Control Price" as defined in Section 4(d) as of the date such
Change in Control or such Potential Change in Control is determined to have
occurred, provided, however, that the provisions of this Section 4 shall not
apply with respect to Awards granted to any participant which have been held by
such participant for less than six months and one day as of the date that such
Change in Control or Potential Change in Control is determined to have occurred.

      (b) Definition of Change in Control. For purposes of Section 4(a), a
"Change in Control" means the happening of any of the following:

            (1) When any "person" as defined in Section 3(a)(9) of the Exchange
Act and as used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) thereof, including a "group" as
defined in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act, but excluding the Company and any
Subsidiary and any employee benefit plan sponsored or maintained by the Company
or any Subsidiary (including any trustee of such plan acting as trustee),
directly or indirectly, becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined in Rule 13d-3
under the Exchange Act, as amended from time to time), of securities of the
Company representing 20 percent or more of the combined voting power of the
Company's then outstanding securities; provided, however, that the terms
"person" and "group" shall not include any "Excluded Director"; and the term
"Excluded Director" means any director who, on the effective date of the Plan,
is the beneficial owner of or has the right to acquire an amount of Stock equal
to five percent or more of the number of shares of Stock outstanding on such
effective date; and further provided that, unless otherwise determined by the
Board or any committee thereof, the terms "person" and "group" shall not include
any entity or group of entities which has acquired Stock of the Company in the
ordinary course of business for investmentpurposes only and not with the purpose
or effect of changing or influencing the control of the Company, or in
connection with or as a participant in any transaction having such purpose or
effect, ("Investment Intent"), as demonstrated by the filing by such entity or
group of a statement on Schedule 13G (including amendments thereto) pursuant to
Regulation 13D under the Exchange Act, as long as such entity or group continues
to hold such Stock with an Investment Intent;

            (2) When, during any period of 24 consecutive months during the
existence of the Plan, the individuals who, at the beginning of such period,
constitute the Board (the "Incumbent Directors") cease for any reason other than
death to constitute at least a majority thereof; provided, however, that a
director who was not a director at the beginning of such 24-month period shall
be deemed to have satisfied such 24-

<PAGE>

month requirement (and be an Incumbent Director) if such director was elected
by, or on the recommendation of or with the approval of, at least two-thirds of
the directors who then qualified as Incumbent Directors either actually (because
they were directors at the beginning of such 24-month period) or by prior
operation of this Section 4(b)(2); or

            (3) The occurrence of a transaction requiring shareholder approval
for the acquisition of the Company by an entity other than the Company or a
Subsidiary through purchase of assets, by merger or otherwise;

provided, however, a change in control shall not be deemed to be a Change in
Control for purposes of the Plan if the Board had approved such change prior to
either (i) the commencement of any of the events described in Section 4(b)(1),
(2), (3) or 4(c)(1), or (ii) the commencement by any person other than the
Company of a tender offer for Stock.

4(a), a "Potential Change in Control" means the happening of any one of the

voting power of the Company's outstanding securities and the adoption by the
Board of a resolution to the effect that a Potential Change in Control of the
Company has occurred for purposes of this Plan.

Control of the Company, at any time during the 60-day period immediately
preceding the occurrence of the Change in Control (or, where applicable, the
occurrence of the Potential Change in Control event).

SECTION 5. AMENDMENTS AND TERMINATION.

            Subject to the following sentence, the Board may at any time, in its
sole discretion, amend, alter or discontinue the Plan, but no such amendment,
alteration or discontinuation shall be made which would impair the rights of a
participant under an Award theretofore granted, without the participant's
consent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) no such amendment or alteration
shall be made which would make the exemption from Section 16(b) of the Exchange
Act provided by Rule 16b-3 thereunder unavailable to any participant holding an
Award or which would result in any liability on the part of any participant
under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, and (b) the provisions of Sections 3(a)
and 3(b)(1) hereof, and any other provisions relating to the eligibility for or
the amount, price or timing of Awards under the Plan, shall not be amended more
than once every six (6) months other than to comport with changes in the Code,
the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 or the rules thereunder. The
Company shall submit to the shareholders of the Company for their approval any
amendments to the Plan which are required by Section 16 of the Exchange Act, or
the related rules and regulations, to be approved by the shareholders.

<PAGE>

SECTION 6. UNFUNDED STATUS OF PLAN.

            The Plan is intended to constitute an "unfunded" plan for incentive
compensation. With respect to any payments not yet made to a participant by the
Company, nothing contained herein shall give any such participant any rights
that are greater than those of a general creditor of the Company.

SECTION 7. GENERAL PROVISIONS.

      (a) The Company may require each participant acquiring Stock pursuant to
an Option under the Plan (i) to represent and warrant to and agree with the
Company in writing that the participant is acquiring the Stock without a view to
the distribution thereof, and (ii) to make such additional representations,
warranties and agreements with respect to the investment intent of such
participant as the Company may request. The certificates for such shares may
include any legend which the Company deems appropriate to reflect any
restrictions on transfer.

      All shares of Stock or other securities delivered under the Plan shall be
subject to such stop-transfer orders and other restrictions as the Company may
deem advisable under the rules, regulations and other requirements of the
Securities and Exchange Commission, anystock exchange upon which the Stock is
then listed, and any applicable federal or state securities law, and the Company
may cause a legend or legends to be put on any certificates for such shares to
make appropriate reference to such restrictions.

      (b) Nothing contained in this Plan shall prevent the Board from adopting
other or additional compensation arrangements, subject to shareholder approval
if such approval is required; and such arrangements may be either generally
applicable or applicable only in specific cases.

      (c) No later than the date as of which an amount first becomes includable
in the gross income of the participant for federal income tax purposes with
respect to any Award under the Plan, the participant shall pay to the Company,
or make arrangements satisfactory to the Company regarding the payment of, any
federal, state or local taxes of any kind required by law to be withheld with
respect to such amount. Subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act and the rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder, withholding obligations may be settled
with unrestricted Stock then owned by the participant or Stock that is issuable
upon the exercise of the Option which gives rise to the withholding requirement.
The obligations of the Company under the Plan shall be conditional on such
payment or arrangements and the Company shall, to the extent permitted by law,
have the right to deduct any such taxes from any payment of any kind otherwise
due to the participant.

      (d) The Plan, all Awards made and actions taken thereunder and any
agreements relating thereto shall be governed by and construed in accordance
with the laws of the State of Ohio.

      (e) All agreements entered into with participants pursuant to the Plan
shall be subject to the Plan.

SECTION 8. EFFECTIVE DATE OF PLAN.

            The Plan was adopted by the Board on April 27, 1990, and approved by
shareholders on April 19, 1991. This amendment and restatement of the Plan shall
be effective as of April 24, 1992.

SECTION 9. TERM OF PLAN.

            No Award shall be granted pursuant to the Plan on or after April 27,
