&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<U>Perfection of Security Interest in Fixtures</U>.  Mortgagor further grants to
Mortgagee a security  interest,  mortgage  and lien on the  Collateral  and this
Mortgage is intended to also serve as a Security Agreement.  With respect to all
fixtures included within the definition of the Mortgaged  Property hereunder and
with respect to all Personal Property which are or are to become fixtures,  this
Mortgage  will  constitute  a  financing  statement  under the  Indiana  Uniform
Commercial  Code.  It is  intended  that as to such  fixtures  and the  proceeds
thereof,  this  Mortgage will be effective as a financing  statement  filed as a
fixture filing in the real estate records of the county in which the Real Estate
is located. The Real Estate affected by this Mortgage is described in Exhibit A.
The owners of record of such Real Estate is  Mortgagor.  Information  concerning
the interest of Mortgagee in such fixtures may be obtained from Mortgagee at its
address set forth in this Mortgage.  Mortgagor  hereby  authorizes  Mortgagee to
execute  and file (in such  offices as may be  necessary  for the  purpose)  any
additional  financing  statements  as it may deem  appropriate  to  perfect  the
security  interest  in fixtures or personal  property  granted  herein,  without
Mortgagor&#146;s  signature  thereon.  For  purposes  of  this  fixture  filing,
Mortgagor is the Debtor and Mortgagee is the Secured Party. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<U>Default</U>.  Upon the  occurrence  of an Event of Default (as defined in the
Loan Agreement), Mortgagee may (at its option) without notice or demand, declare
the entire balance of said  indebtedness  to be immediately  due and payable and
may  forthwith  commence an action to  foreclose  this  Mortgage in any court of
competent  jurisdiction.  And it is further  agreed  that,  in such  foreclosure
action,  Mortgagee will be entitled as a matter of right to the appointment,  ex
parte and without  notice,  of a receiver to take  possession  of the  Mortgaged
Property,  and to receive  and collect  the  income,  rents,  issues and profits
thereof, and to lease the same if the same is not then under lease, and all sums
received and  collected by said receiver will be applied first to the payment of
the costs  and  expenses  of such  receivership,  next to the  costs  (including
reasonable attorneys&#146; fees) of said foreclosure action, next to the payment
of unpaid real  estate  taxes and  assessments,  next to the payment of interest
accrued in the  indebtedness  secured hereby,  and finally to the payment of the
unpaid  principal  balance of the  indebtedness  secured  hereby.  The foregoing
remedies will be in addition to all other remedies available to Mortgagee at law
or in equity. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<U>Effect  of Waiver or  Release</U>.  The failure of  Mortgagee to exercise any
right or remedy  available to it hereunder  will not constitute a waiver of such
right  or  remedy  for any  continuing  or  repeated  default,  and will not bar
Mortgagee from the exercise of such right or remedy or any other right or remedy
available to it hereunder. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<U>Notices</U>.  All  notices  to be given  pursuant  to this  Mortgage  will be
sufficient if given by personal  service,  or by guaranteed  overnight  delivery
service,  or by postage  prepaid  mailing by certified or  registered  mail with
return receipt  requested,  to the parties as set forth below,  or to such other
address as a party may request by notice  given  pursuant to this  Section.  Any
time period  provided in the giving of any notice  hereunder shall commence upon
the date of personal service, the day after delivery to the guaranteed overnight
delivery  service,  or two (2) days after mailing  certified or registered mail.
However, any failure to give notice in accordance with the terms of this Section
will not  invalidate  such  notice if such  notice  was in fact in  writing  and
actually received by the party to whom it was directed. </FONT></P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<U>Collection  Costs</U>.  Mortgagor  will be obligated to pay any and all costs
incurred  in  the  collection  of the  indebtedness  secured  hereby  and in the
foreclosure  of this  Mortgage  and the sale of the  Mortgaged  Property as such
costs  are  incurred.   As  used  herein,  the  term  &#147;costs   incurred  in
collection&#148;  means all costs and expenses  reasonably incurred by Mortgagee
in or in  connection  with the  foreclosure  of this Mortgage or the sale of the
Mortgaged Property,  including (without limitation) court costs,  sheriff&#146;s
or   marshal&#146;s   fees,   fees  for   publication   of  notice,   reasonable
attorneys&#146;  fees,  abstracting  fees, title insurance  premiums,  appraisal
fees,  surveyor&#146;s fees, environmental assessment fees and costs incurred in
remediating any contamination of the Mortgaged Property. </FONT></P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<U>Valuation and Appraisement</U>. All sums payable under this Mortgage shall be
without relief from valuation and appraisement laws. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<U>Eminent  Domain</U>.  Mortgagor,  immediately upon obtaining knowledge of the
institution of any  proceeding  for the taking of the Mortgaged  Property or any
portion  thereof  under the power of  eminent  domain,  shall  notify  Mortgagee
thereof. Mortgagee may, at its option, appear in and prosecute, in its own name,
any action or  proceeding,  or make any  compromise  or settlement in connection
with such proceeding,  and Mortgagor appoints Mortgagee as Mortgagor&#146;s true
and  lawful  attorney  for such  purposes,  such  power  being  coupled  with an
interest.   After   deducting   all  of  its  expenses,   including   reasonable
attorneys&#146;   fees,   Mortgagee  may  elect,  in  its  sole  discretion  and
notwithstanding the fact that the security given hereby may not be impaired by a
partial condemnation,  to apply any part or all of the proceeds of the award, in
such order as Mortgagee may determine, in reduction of the Indebtedness, whether
due or not.  Any  application  of all or a portion of the  proceeds  of any such
award to the  Indebtedness  shall not cure or waive  any  default  hereunder  or
invalidate any act done pursuant to any notice of default.  Mortgagor  agrees to
execute such further assignments of any compensation,  award, damages,  right of
action and proceeds as Mortgagee may require. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<U>Damage or  Destruction</U>.  Mortgagor will give  Mortgagee  prompt notice of
damage to or destruction  of any  improvements  on the Mortgaged  Property or to
personal property used in the operation of the Mortgaged Property and in case of
loss covered by policies of  insurance,  Mortgagee is hereby  authorized to make
proof of loss if not promptly  made by Mortgagor or the lessees  under any lease
of   any   portion   of   the   Mortgaged   Property    (&#147;Lease&#148;    or
&#147;Leases&#148;).  Any expenses  incurred by Mortgagee in the  collection  of
insurance proceeds, together with interest thereon from the date of such expense
at the highest default rate set forth in the Notes, shall be added to and become
a part of the  Indebtedness  and shall be  reimbursed  by Mortgagor to Mortgagee
immediately upon demand. Such net proceeds may be applied by Mortgagee,  upon or
in  reduction  of the  Indebtedness  then most  remotely  to be paid,  without a
prepayment fee, or to the cost of rebuilding or restoration of the  improvements
on the  Mortgaged  Property.  However,  if  Mortgagee  shall  require  that  the
improvements on the Mortgaged Property be repaired or rebuilt,  then the repair,
restoration,  replacement  or  rebuilding of the  improvements  on the Mortgaged
Property shall be to a condition of at least equal value as prior to such damage
or  destruction,  and such net  proceeds of  insurance  shall be made  available
therefor under the conditions and in the manner set forth below. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=1>

<PAGE>

<P align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
So long as there exists no Event of Default (as defined in the Loan  Agreement),
and  provided  any loss or damage  cannot,  in the sole  judgment of  Mortgagee,
result in the termination,  cancellation or modification of the Leases (if any),
and if the Leases so require and the  insurers do not deny  liability  as to the
insureds,  such  insurance  proceeds,   after  deducting  expenses  incurred  in
collection,  shall be made  available  under the  conditions  and in the  manner
specified in the following paragraph, for the repair,  restoration,  replacement
or rebuilding  of  improvements  on the Mortgaged  Property to a condition of at
least equal value as existed  prior to such  damage or  destruction.  Otherwise,
such net proceeds may be applied by Mortgagee, in its sole discretion,  upon and
in  reduction  of the  Indebtedness  then most  remotely  to be paid in  inverse
chronological  order,  or to  the  cost  of  rebuilding  or  restoration  of the
Mortgaged  Property or personal  property.  However,  if Mortgagee shall require
that the  Mortgaged  Property  be repaired  or rebuilt in  accordance  with this
Agreement, such net proceeds of insurance shall be made available therefor under
the conditions and in the manner set forth below. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Insurance  proceeds  made  available for  restoration,  repair,  replacement  or
rebuilding of the improvements on the Mortgaged Property shall be disbursed from
time to time  (provided no default  exists in the or in this Agreement or in any
of the Instruments or any Lease at the time of each  disbursement),  after first
deducting the expenses of disbursement including, without limitation, reasonable
attorneys&#146;  fees,  costs of title  insurance,  escrows and  closings by the
title company and fees and expenses of the disbursing party, upon the disbursing
party being  provided  with  satisfactory  evidence of the cost of completion of
such  work  and  of  the  diligent  and  timely  prosecution  thereof  and  with
architect&#146;s   certificates,   waivers   of  lien,   contractors&#146;   and
subcontractors&#146;  sworn  statements and other evidence of costs and payments
so that the disbursing party can verify that the amounts  disbursed from time to
time are  represented  by completed and in place work and that said work is free
and clear of all mechanics&#146; lien claims. No payment made prior to the final
completion of such restoration,  repair,  replacement or rebuilding shall exceed
ninety percent (90%) of the value of the work performed from time to time and at
all times the undisbursed balance of such proceeds remaining in the hands of the
disbursing  party,  together with funds deposited for the purpose or irrevocably
committed for such purpose,  shall be sufficient in the  reasonable  judgment of
Mortgagee,  to pay for the cost of completion of all such  restoration,  repair,
replacement or rebuilding.  Mortgagee may require that plans and  specifications
for the  restoration,  repair,  replacement  or  rebuilding  be submitted to and
approved by Mortgagee  prior to the  commencement of the work. Any surplus which
may remain out of said insurance proceeds after payment of costs of building and
restoration may, at the option of Mortgagee, be applied either on account of the
Indebtedness  then most  remotely  to be paid in  inverse  chronological  order,
without a prepayment fee, or be paid to any person or persons otherwise entitled
thereto.  Application or release of proceeds  under the provisions  hereof shall
not cure or waive any default  hereunder or invalidate  any act done pursuant to
any  notice of  default.  No  interest  shall be  allowed on account of any such
proceeds or other funds held in the hands of Mortgagee or the disbursing  party.
