Borrowing consisting of Eurocurrency Rate Advances denominated in any Committed

Advances may not be outstanding as part of more than ten separate Borrowings.</p>

fulfill on or before the date specified in such Notice of Borrowing for such
Borrowing the applicable conditions set forth in Article&nbsp;III, including,
without limitation, any loss (excluding loss of anticipated profits), cost or
expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or

Lender as part of such Borrowing when such Advance, as a result of such
failure, is not made on such date.</p>

<p>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unless the Agent shall have received notice from a Lender

the Agent such Lender's ratable portion of such Borrowing, the Agent may assume
that such Lender has made such portion available to the Agent on the date of
such Borrowing in accordance with subsection&nbsp;(a) of this Section&nbsp;2.02
and the Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the
Borrower on such date a corresponding amount.&nbsp;
If and to the extent that such Lender shall not have so made such
ratable portion available to the Agent, such Lender and the Borrower severally
agree to repay to the Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount
together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is made
available to the Borrower until the date such amount is repaid to the Agent, at
(i)&nbsp;in the case of the Borrower, the higher of (A) the interest rate
applicable at the time to Advances comprising such Borrowing and (B) the cost
of funds incurred by the Agent in respect of such amount and (ii)&nbsp;in the
case of such Lender, (A) the Federal Funds Rate in the case of Advances
denominated in Dollars or (B) the cost of funds incurred by the Agent in
respect of such amount in the case of Advances denominated in Committed Currencies.
If such Lender shall repay to the Agent such corresponding amount, such amount
so repaid shall constitute such Lender's Advance as part of such Borrowing for
purposes of this Agreement.</p>

<p>(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The failure of any Lender to make the Advance to be made by
it as part of any Borrowing shall not relieve any other Lender of its

Borrowing, but no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other
Lender to make the Advance to be made by such other Lender on the date of any
Borrowing.</p>

each Lender hereby acquires from such Issuing Bank, a participation in such
Letter of Credit equal to such Lender's Pro Rata Share of the aggregate amount

Borrower for any reason.&nbsp; Each Lender
acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations pursuant

Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset,
abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever.</p>

Issuing Bank of a draft drawn under any Letter of Credit shall constitute for
all purposes of this Agreement the making by any such Issuing Bank of an

(and such Issuing Bank will use its commercially reasonable efforts to deliver
such notice within one Business Day) of each drawing under any Letter of Credit
issued by it to the Borrower and the Agent.&nbsp;
Upon written demand by such Issuing Bank, with a copy of such demand to
the Agent, subject to Section 2.19(e), each Lender shall pay to the Agent such
Lender's Pro Rata Share of such outstanding Advance, by making available for
the account of its Applicable Lending Office to the Agent for the account of
such Issuing Bank, by deposit to the Agent's Account, in same day funds, an
amount equal to the portion of the outstanding principal amount of such Advance
to be funded by such Lender.&nbsp; Promptly
after receipt thereof, the Agent shall transfer such funds to such Issuing
Bank.&nbsp; Each Lender agrees to fund its
Pro Rata Share of an outstanding Advance on (i)&nbsp;the Business Day on which
demand therefor is made by such Issuing Bank, <u>provided</u> that notice of
such demand is given not later than 11:00&nbsp;A.M. (New&nbsp;York City time)

its account or the account of such Issuing Bank, as applicable.&nbsp; If such Lender shall pay to the Agent such
amount for the account of any such Issuing Bank on any Business Day, such
amount so paid in respect of principal shall constitute an Advance made by such
Lender on such Business Day for purposes of this Agreement, and the outstanding
principal amount of the Advance made by such Issuing Bank shall be reduced by
such amount on such Business Day.</a></p>

obligation hereunder to make its Advance on such date, but no Lender shall be
responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make the Advance to be made
by such other Lender on such date.</p>

interest rate on the basis of timely information furnished by the remaining
Reference Banks.&nbsp; The Agent shall give
prompt notice to the Borrower and the Lenders of the applicable interest rate
determined by the Agent for purposes of Section&nbsp;2.07(a)(i) or (ii), and

(London time) on the second Business Day before the making of a Borrowing in
sufficient amounts to fund their respective Advances as a part of such
Borrowing during its Interest Period or (ii)&nbsp;the Eurocurrency Rate for any
Interest Period for such Advances will not adequately reflect the cost to such
Required Lenders of making, funding or maintaining their respective
Eurocurrency Rate Advances for such Interest Period, the Agent shall forthwith
so notify the Borrower and the Lenders, whereupon (A)&nbsp;the Borrower will,
on the last day of the then existing Interest Period therefor, (1)&nbsp;if such
Eurocurrency Rate Advances are denominated in Dollars, either (x) prepay such Advances
or (y) Convert such Advances into Base Rate Advances and (2)&nbsp;if such
Eurocurrency Rate Advances are denominated in any Committed Currency, either

Lenders and such Advances will automatically, on the last day of the then
existing Interest Period therefor, (i)&nbsp;if such Eurocurrency Rate Advances
are denominated in Dollars, Convert into Base Rate Advances and (ii)&nbsp;if
such Eurocurrency Rate Advances are denominated in a Committed Currency, be
exchanged for an Equivalent amount of Dollars and Convert into Base Rate
Advances.</p>

Event of Default under Section&nbsp;6.01(a), (i)&nbsp;each Eurocurrency Rate
Advance will automatically, on the last day of the then existing Interest
Period therefor, (A)&nbsp;if such Eurocurrency Rate Advances are denominated in
Dollars, be Converted into Base Rate Advances and (B)&nbsp;if such Eurocurrency
Rate Advances are denominated in any Committed Currency, be exchanged for an
Equivalent amount of Dollars and be Converted into Base Rate Advances and
(ii)&nbsp;the obligation of the Lenders to make, or to Convert Advances into,
Eurocurrency Rate Advances shall be suspended.</p>

<p>(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Telerate Markets Page 3750 or Page 248, as applicable,

Borrower and the Lenders that the interest rate cannot be determined for such
Eurocurrency Rate Advances,</p>

Advances, each such Advance will automatically, on the last day of the then
existing Interest Period therefor, (A)&nbsp;if such Eurocurrency Rate Advance
is denominated in Dollars, Convert into a Base Rate Advance and (B)&nbsp;if
such Eurocurrency Rate Advance is denominated in any Committed Currency, be
prepaid by the Borrower or be automatically exchanged for an Equivalent amount
of Dollars and be Converted into a Base Rate Advance (or if such Advance is
then a Base Rate Advance, will continue as a Base Rate Advance), and</p>

<p>(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the obligation of the Lenders to make
Eurocurrency Rate Advances or to Convert Advances into Eurocurrency Rate

no Conversion of any Advances shall result in more separate Borrowings than
permitted under Section&nbsp;2.02(b).&nbsp;
Each such notice of a Conversion shall, within the restrictions
specified above, specify (i)&nbsp;the date of such Conversion, (ii)&nbsp;the

stating the proposed date and aggregate principal amount of the prepayment, and
if such notice is given the Borrower shall, prepay the outstanding principal
amount of the Advances comprising part of the same Borrowing in whole or
ratably in part, together with accrued interest to the date of such prepayment
on the principal amount prepaid; <u>provided</u>, <u>however</u>, that (x) each

the interpretation of any law or regulation after the date hereof or
(ii)&nbsp;the compliance with any guideline or European Union or similar
monetary or multinational authority (whether or not having the force of law)
promulgated after the date hereof, there shall be any increase in the cost to
any Lender of agreeing to make or making, funding or maintaining Eurocurrency
Rate Advances or of agreeing to issue or of issuing or maintaining or
participating in Letters of Credit (excluding for purposes of this Section 2.11
any such increased costs resulting from (i) Taxes or Other Taxes (as to which
Section 2.14 shall govern) and (ii) changes in the basis of taxation of overall
net income or overall gross income by the United States or by the foreign
jurisdiction or state under the laws of which such Lender is organized or has
its Applicable Lending Office or any political subdivision thereof), then the
Borrower shall from time to time, within five Business Days after demand by
such Lender (with a copy of such demand to the Agent), pay to the Agent for the
account of such Lender additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Lender
for such increased cost; <u>provided</u>, <u>however</u>, that before making
any such demand, each Lender agrees to use reasonable efforts (consistent with
its internal policy and legal and regulatory restrictions) to designate a
different Applicable Lending Office if the making of such a designation would
avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, such increased cost and would not,
in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to such
Lender.&nbsp; A certificate as to the amount
of such increased cost, submitted to the Borrower and the Agent by such Lender,
shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.</p>

regulation or any guideline or request from any central bank or other
governmental authority (whether or not having the force of law) promulgated
after the Effective Date affects or would affect the amount of capital required
or expected to be maintained by such Lender or any corporation controlling such
Lender and that the amount of such capital is increased by or based upon the
existence of such Lender's commitment to lend hereunder and other commitments
of this type, then, within five Business Days after demand by such Lender (with
a copy of such demand to the Agent), the Borrower shall pay to the Agent for
the account of such Lender, from time to time as specified by such Lender,
additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Lender or such corporation in
the light of such circumstances, to the extent that such Lender reasonably
determines such increase in capital to be allocable to the existence of such
Lender's commitment to lend hereunder.&nbsp;
A certificate as to such amounts submitted to the Borrower and the Agent
by such Lender shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent
manifest error.</p>

<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Failure or delay on the part of any
Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a
waiver of such Lender's right to demand
such compensation; <u>provided</u> that the Borrower shall not be required to
compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or
reductions incurred more than six months prior to the date that such Lender
notifies the Borrower of the circumstance giving rise to such increased costs
or reductions and of such Lender's intention to claim compensation therefor; <u>provided</u>
<u>further</u> that, if the circumstance giving rise to such increased costs or
reductions is retroactive, then the six-month period referred to above shall be
extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.</p>

<p>SECTION 2.12.&nbsp; <u>Illegality</u><u><a name="_Toc29119491"></a></u>.&nbsp;
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if any Lender
shall notify the Agent that the introduction of or any change in or in the
interpretation of any law or regulation makes it unlawful, or any central bank
or other governmental authority asserts that it is unlawful, for any Lender or
its Eurocurrency Lending Office to perform its obligations hereunder to make
Eurocurrency Rate Advances in Dollars or any Committed Currency or to fund or
maintain&nbsp; Eurocurrency Rate Advances in
Dollars or any Committed Currency hereunder, (a)&nbsp;each Eurocurrency Rate
Advance will automatically, (i) if such Eurocurrency Rate Advance is
denominated in Dollars, be Converted into a Base Rate Advance and (ii)&nbsp;if
such Eurocurrency Rate Advance is denominated in any Committed Currency, be
exchanged into an Equivalent amount of Dollars and be Converted into a Base
Rate Advance and (b)&nbsp;the obligation of the Lenders to make Eurocurrency
Rate Advances or to Convert Advances into Eurocurrency Rate Advances shall be
suspended until the Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders that the
circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist; <u>provided</u>, <u>however</u>,
that before making any such demand, each Lender agrees to use reasonable
efforts (consistent with its internal policy and legal and regulatory
restrictions) to designate a different Eurocurrency Lending Office if the
making of such a designation would allow such Lender or its Eurocurrency
Lending Office to continue to perform its obligations to make Eurocurrency Rate
Advances or to continue to fund or maintain Eurocurrency Rate Advances and
would not, in the judgment of such Lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to such
Lender.</p>

<p>SECTION 2.13.&nbsp; <u>Payments and Computations</u><u><a name="_Toc29119492"></a></u>.&nbsp; (a)&nbsp; The Borrower shall make each payment
hereunder (other than with respect to principal of, interest on, and other
amounts relating to, Advances denominated in a Committed Currency),
irrespective of any right of counterclaim or set- off, not later than
11:00&nbsp;A.M. (New&nbsp;York City time) on the day when due in Dollars to the
Agent at the applicable Agent's Account in same day funds.&nbsp; The Borrower shall make each payment
hereunder with respect to principal of, interest on, and other amounts relating
to, Advances denominated in a Committed Currency, irrespective of any right of
counterclaim or set-off, not later than 11:00&nbsp;A.M. (at the Payment Office
for such Committed Currency) on the day when due in such Committed Currency to
the Agent, by deposit of such funds to the applicable Agent's Account in same
day funds.&nbsp; The Agent will promptly
thereafter cause to be distributed like funds relating to the payment of
principal or interest or facility fees ratably (other than amounts payable
pursuant to Section&nbsp;2.11, 2.14 or 8.04(c)) to the Lenders for the account
of their respective Applicable Lending Offices, and like funds relating to the
payment of any other amount payable to any Lender to such Lender for the
account of its Applicable Lending Office, in each case to be applied in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement.&nbsp;
Upon any Assuming Lender becoming a Lender hereunder as a result of an
extension of the Termination Date pursuant to Section 2.18 or a Commitment
Increase pursuant to Section 2.19, and upon the Agent's receipt of such
Lender's Assumption Agreement and recording of the information contained
therein in the Register, from and after the applicable Increase Date or
Extension Date, as the case may be, the Agent shall make all payments hereunder
and under any Notes issued in connection therewith in respect of the interest assumed
thereby to the Assuming Lender.&nbsp; Upon
its acceptance of an Assignment and Acceptance and recording of the information
contained therein in the Register pursuant to Section&nbsp;8.07(c), from and
after the effective date specified in such Assignment and Acceptance, the Agent
shall make all payments hereunder and under any Notes in respect of the
interest assigned thereby to the Lender assignee thereunder, and the parties to
such Assignment and Acceptance shall make all appropriate adjustments in such
payments for periods prior to such effective date directly between themselves.</p>

<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Borrower hereby authorizes each Lender, if and to the
extent payment owed to such Lender is not made when due hereunder or under the
Note held by such Lender, to charge from time to time against any or all of the
Borrower's accounts with such Lender any amount so due.</p>

<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All computations of interest based on the Base Rate shall
be made by the Agent on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may
be, all computations of interest based on the Eurocurrency Rate or the Federal
Funds Rate and of fees and Letter of Credit commissions shall be made by the
Agent on the basis of a year of 360 days (or, in each case of Advances
denominated in Sterling, on the basis of 365 days), in each case for the actual
number of days (including the first day but excluding the last day) occurring
in the period for which such interest, fees or commissions are payable.&nbsp; Each determination by the Agent of an
interest rate hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes,
absent manifest error.</p>

<p>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whenever any payment hereunder or under the Notes shall be
stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made
on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such
case be included in the computation of payment of interest, fee or commission,
as the case may be; <u>provided</u>, <u>however</u>, that, if such extension
would cause payment of interest on or principal of Eurocurrency Rate Advances
to be made in the next following calendar month, such payment shall be made on
the next preceding Business Day.</p>

<p>(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unless the Agent shall have received notice from the
Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Lenders hereunder
that the Borrower will not make such payment in full, the Agent may assume that
the Borrower has made such payment in full to the Agent on such date and the
Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each
Lender on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such
Lender.&nbsp; If and to the extent the
Borrower shall not have so made such payment in full to the Agent, each Lender
shall repay to the Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such
Lender together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount
is distributed to such Lender until the date such Lender repays such amount to
the Agent, at (i) the Federal Funds Rate in the case of Advances denominated in
Dollars or (ii) the cost of funds incurred by the Agent in respect of such
amount in the case of Advances denominated in Committed Currencies.</p>

<p>(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To the extent that the Agent receives
funds for application to the amounts owing by any Borrower under or in respect
of this Agreement or any Note in currencies other than the currency or
currencies required to enable the Agent to distribute funds to the Lenders in
accordance with the terms of this Section 2.13, the Agent shall be entitled to
convert or exchange such funds into Dollars or into a Committed Currency to the
extent necessary to enable the Agent to distribute such funds in accordance
with the terms of this Section 2.13; provided that the Borrower and each of the
Lenders hereby agree that the Agent shall not be liable or responsible for any
loss, cost or expense suffered by the Borrower or such Lender as a result of
any conversion or exchange of currencies affected pursuant to this Section
2.13(f) or as a result of the failure of the Agent to effect any such
conversion or exchange; and provided further that the Borrower agrees to
indemnify the Agent and each Lender, and hold the Agent and each Lender
harmless, for any and all losses, costs and expenses incurred by the Agent or
any Lender for any conversion or exchange of currencies (or the failure to
convert or exchange any currencies) in accordance with this Section 2.13(f).</p>

<p>SECTION 2.14.&nbsp; <u>Taxes</u><u><a name="_Toc29119493"></a></u>.&nbsp; (a)&nbsp; Any and all payments by the Borrower to or
for the account of any Lender or the Agent hereunder or under the Notes or any
other documents to be delivered hereunder shall be made, in accordance with
Section&nbsp;2.13 or the applicable provisions of such other documents, free
and clear of and without deduction for any and all present or future taxes,
levies, imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings, and all liabilities with
respect thereto, <u>excluding</u>, in the case of each Lender and the Agent,
taxes imposed on its overall net income (including backup withholding taxes),
and franchise taxes imposed on it, by the jurisdiction under the laws of which
such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) is organized or any political
subdivision thereof and, in the case of each Lender, taxes imposed on its
overall net income (including backup withholding taxes), and franchise taxes
imposed on it, by the jurisdiction of such Lender's Applicable Lending Office
or any political subdivision thereof (all such non-excluded taxes, levies,
imposts, deductions, charges, withholdings and liabilities in respect of
payments hereunder or under the Notes being hereinafter referred to as &quot;<u>Taxes</u>&quot;).&nbsp; If the Borrower shall be required by law to
deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder or under any
Note or any other documents to be delivered hereunder to any Lender or the
Agent, (i)&nbsp;the sum payable shall be increased as may be necessary so that
after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to
additional sums payable under this Section&nbsp;2.14) such Lender or the Agent
(as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received
had no such deductions been made, (ii)&nbsp;the Borrower shall make such
deductions and (iii)&nbsp;the Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to
the relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance with
applicable law.</p>

<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, the Borrower shall pay any present or future
stamp or documentary taxes or any other excise or property taxes, charges or
similar levies that arise from any payment made hereunder or under the Notes
any other documents to be delivered hereunder or from the execution, delivery
or registration of, performing under, or otherwise with respect to, this
Agreement or the Notes or any other documents to be delivered hereunder
(hereinafter referred to as &quot;<u>Other Taxes</u>&quot;).</p>

<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Borrower shall indemnify each Lender and the Agent for
and hold it harmless against the full amount of Taxes or Other Taxes
(including, without limitation, taxes of any kind imposed or asserted by any
jurisdiction on amounts payable under this Section&nbsp;2.14) imposed on or
paid by such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) and any liability
(including penalties, interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect
thereto.&nbsp; This indemnification shall be
made within 30 days from the date such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be)
makes written demand therefor.</p>

<p>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Within 30 days after the date of any payment of Taxes, the
Borrower shall furnish to the Agent, at its address referred to in
Section&nbsp;8.02, the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing
such payment to the extent such a receipt is issued therefor, or other written
proof of payment thereof that is reasonably satisfactory to the Agent.&nbsp; In the case of any payment hereunder or
under the Notes or any other documents to be delivered hereunder by or on
behalf of the Borrower through an account or branch outside the United States
or by or on behalf of the Borrower by a payor that is not a United States
person, if the Borrower determines that no Taxes are payable in respect
thereof, the Borrower shall furnish, or shall cause such payor to furnish, to
the Agent, at such address, an opinion of counsel acceptable to the Agent
stating that such payment is exempt from Taxes.&nbsp; For purposes of this subsection (d) and subsection (e), the terms
&quot;<u>United States</u>&quot; and &quot;<u>United States person</u>&quot;
shall have the meanings specified in Section&nbsp;7701 of the Internal Revenue
Code.</p>

<p>(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each Lender organized under the laws of a jurisdiction
outside the United States, on or prior to the date of its execution and
delivery of this Agreement in the case of each Bank and on the date of the
Assumption Agreement or the Assignment and Acceptance pursuant to which it
becomes a Lender in the case of each other Lender, and from time to time
thereafter (but only so long as such Lender remains lawfully able to do so) as
reasonably requested in writing by the Borrower, shall provide each of the
Agent and the Borrower with two original Internal Revenue Service
forms&nbsp;W-8BEN or W-8ECI, as appropriate, or any successor or other form
prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service (including forms required for
exemption from withholding under Sections 871(h) and 881(c) of the Internal
Revenue Code), certifying that such Lender is exempt from or entitled to a
reduced rate of United States withholding tax on payments pursuant to this
Agreement or the Notes.&nbsp; If the form
provided by a Lender at the time such Lender first becomes a party to this
Agreement indicates a United States interest withholding tax rate in excess of
zero, withholding tax at such rate shall be considered excluded from Taxes
unless and until such Lender provides the appropriate forms certifying that a
lesser rate applies, whereupon withholding tax at such lesser rate only shall
be considered excluded from Taxes for periods governed by such form; <u>provided</u>,
<u>however</u>, that, if at the date of the Assignment and Acceptance pursuant
to which a Lender assignee becomes a party to this Agreement, the Lender
assignor was entitled to payments under subsection&nbsp;(a) in respect of
United States withholding tax with respect to interest paid at such date, then,
to such extent, the term Taxes shall include (in addition to withholding taxes
that may be imposed in the future or other amounts otherwise includable in
Taxes) United States withholding tax, if any, applicable with respect to the
Lender assignee on such date but only to the extent that the United States
withholding tax rate applicable with respect to the Lender assignee does not
exceed the rate applicable to the Lender assignor with respect to interest paid
at the date of such Assignment and Acceptance.&nbsp;
If any form or document referred to in this subsection&nbsp;(e) requires
the disclosure of information, other than information necessary to compute the
tax payable and information required on the date hereof by Internal Revenue
Service form&nbsp;W-8BEN or W-8ECI (or in the case of a Lender assignee, other
than the information required on such Internal Revenue Service forms or
successor forms on the date of the Assignment and Acceptance pursuant to which
such Lender assignee became a party to this Agreement), that the Lender
reasonably considers to be confidential, the Lender shall give notice thereof
to the Borrower and shall not be obligated to include in such form or document
such confidential information.</p>

<p>(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For any period with respect to which a Lender has failed
to provide the Borrower with the appropriate form, certificate or other
document described in Section&nbsp;2.14(e) (<u>other</u> <u>than</u> if such
failure is due to a change in law, or in the interpretation or application
thereof, occurring subsequent to the date on which a form, certificate or other
document originally was required to be provided, such Lender shall not be
entitled to indemnification under Section&nbsp;2.14(a) or (c) with respect to
Taxes imposed by the United States by reason of such failure; <u>provided</u>, <u>however</u>,
that should a Lender become subject to Taxes because of its failure to deliver
a form, certificate or other document required hereunder, the Borrower shall
take such steps as the Lender shall reasonably request to assist the Lender to
recover such Taxes.</p>

<p>(g)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any Lender claiming any additional amounts payable
pursuant to this Section&nbsp;2.14 agrees to use reasonable efforts (consistent
with its internal policy and legal and regulatory restrictions) to change the
jurisdiction of its Eurocurrency Lending Office if the making of such a change
would avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, any such additional amounts
that may thereafter accrue and would not, in the reasonable judgment of such
Lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender.</p>

<p>(h)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each Lender (and the Agent with respect to payments to the
Agent for its own account) agrees that (i) it will take all reasonable actions
by all usual means to maintain all exemptions, if any , available to it from
the United States withholding taxes (whether available by treaty, existing
administrative waiver, by virtue of the location of any Lender's applicable
Lending Office or otherwise) and (ii) otherwise cooperate with the Borrower to
minimize amounts payable by the Borrower under this Section 2.14; <u>provided</u>,
<u>however</u>, that each Lender and the Agent shall not be obligated by reason
of this subsection (h) to disclose any information regarding its tax affairs or
tax computations or to reorder its tax or other affairs or tax or other
planning.</p>

<p>(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If any Lender determines, in its sole discretion, that it
has actually and finally realized, by reason of a refund, deduction or credit
of any Taxes paid or reimbursed by the Borrower pursuant to subsection (a) or
(c) above in respect of payments under the Credit Agreement or the Notes, a
current monetary benefit that it would otherwise not have obtained, and that
would result in the total payments under this Section 2.14 exceeding the amount
needed to make such Lender whole, such Lender shall pay to the Borrower, with
reasonable promptness following the date on which it actually realizes such
benefit, an amount equal to the lesser of the amount of such benefit or the
amount of such excess, in each case net of all out-of-pocket expenses in securing
such refund, deduction or credit.</p>

<p>SECTION 2.15.&nbsp; <u>Sharing of Payments, Etc</u>.<a name="_Toc29119494"></a>&nbsp; If any Lender
shall obtain any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise
of any right of set-off, or otherwise) on account of the Advances owing to it
(other than pursuant to Section&nbsp;2.11, 2.14 or 8.04(c)) in excess of its
ratable share of payments on account of the Advances obtained by all the
Lenders, such Lender shall forthwith purchase from the other Lenders such
participations in the Advances owing to them as shall be necessary to cause
such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment ratably with each of them; <u>provided</u>,
<u>however</u>, that if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter
recovered from such purchasing Lender, such purchase from each Lender shall be
rescinded and such Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the purchase
price to the extent of such recovery together with an amount equal to such
Lender's ratable share (according to the proportion of (i)&nbsp;the amount of
such Lender's required repayment to (ii)&nbsp;the total amount so recovered
from the purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by
the purchasing Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered.&nbsp; The Borrower agrees that any Lender so
purchasing a participation from another Lender pursuant to this
Section&nbsp;2.15 may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its
rights of payment (including the right of set-off) with respect to such participation
as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of the Borrower in the
amount of such participation.</p>

<p>SECTION 2.16.&nbsp; <u>Evidence of Debt</u><u><a name="_Toc29119495"></a></u>.&nbsp; (a)&nbsp; Each Lender shall maintain in accordance
with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of
the Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Advance owing to such Lender
from time to time, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and
paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder in respect of Advances.&nbsp; The Borrower agrees that upon notice by any
Lender to the Borrower (with a copy of such notice to the Agent) to the effect
that a Note is required or appropriate in order for such Lender to evidence
(whether for purposes of pledge, enforcement or otherwise) the Advances owing
to, or to be made by, such Lender, the Borrower shall promptly execute and
deliver to such Lender a Note payable to the order of such Lender in a
principal amount up to the Revolving Credit Commitment of such Lender.</p>

<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Register maintained by the Agent pursuant to Section
8.07(d) shall include a control account, and a subsidiary account for each
Lender, in which accounts (taken together) shall be recorded (i) the date and
amount of each Borrowing made hereunder, the Type of Advances comprising such
Borrowing and, if appropriate, the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the
terms of each Assumption Agreement and each Assignment and Acceptance delivered
to and accepted by it, (iii) the amount of any principal or interest due and
payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to each Lender hereunder
and (iv) the amount of any sum received by the Agent from the Borrower
hereunder and each Lender's share thereof.</p>

<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Entries made in good faith by the Agent in the Register
pursuant to subsection (b) above, and by each Lender in its account or accounts
pursuant to subsection (a) above, shall be <u>prima</u> <u>facie</u> evidence
of the amount of principal and interest due and payable or to become due and payable
from the Borrower to, in the case of the Register, each Lender and, in the case
of such account or accounts, such Lender, under this Agreement, absent manifest
error; <u>provided</u>, <u>however</u>, that the failure of the Agent or such
Lender to make an entry, or any finding that an entry is incorrect, in the
Register or such account or accounts shall not limit or otherwise affect the
obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement.</p>

<p>SECTION 2.17.&nbsp; <u>Use of Proceeds</u><u><a name="_Toc29119496"></a></u>.&nbsp; The proceeds
of the Advances and issuances of Letters of Credit shall be available (and the
Borrower agrees that it shall use such proceeds) solely for general corporate
purposes of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries.</p>

<p>SECTION 2.18.&nbsp; <u>Extension of Termination Date</u><u><a name="_Toc29119497"></a></u>.&nbsp; (a) At least
30 days but not more than 60 days prior to any anniversary of the Effective
Date, the Borrower, by written notice to the Agent, may request an extension of
the Termination Date in effect at such time by one year from its then scheduled
expiration.&nbsp; The Agent shall promptly
notify each Lender of such request, and each Lender shall in turn, in its sole
discretion, not later than 25 days prior to such anniversary date, notify the
Borrower and the Agent in writing as to whether such Lender will consent to
such extension.&nbsp; If any Lender shall
fail to notify the Agent and the Borrower in writing of its consent to any such
request for extension of the Termination Date at least 25 days prior to such
anniversary date, such Lender shall be deemed to be a Non-Consenting Lender
with respect to such request.&nbsp; The Agent
shall promptly (but in any event not later than 15 days prior to such
anniversary date) notify the Borrower of the decision of the Lenders pursuant
to this Section 2.18 regarding the Borrower's request for an extension of the
Termination Date.</p>

<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If all the Lenders consent in writing to any such request
in accordance with subsection (a) of this Section 2.18, the Termination Date in
effect at such time shall, effective as at the applicable anniversary date (the
&quot;<u>Extension Date</u>&quot;), be extended for one year; <u>provided</u>
that on each Extension Date the applicable conditions set forth in Section 3.02
shall be satisfied.&nbsp; If less than all of
the Lenders consent in writing to any such request in accordance with
subsection (a) of this Section 2.18, the Termination Date in effect at such
time shall, effective as at the applicable Extension Date and subject to
subsection (d) of this Section 2.18, be extended as to those Lenders that so
consented (each a &quot;<u>Consenting Lender</u>&quot;) but shall not be
extended as to any other Lender (each a &quot;<u>Non-Consenting Lender</u>&quot;).&nbsp; To the extent that the Termination Date is
not extended as to any Lender pursuant to this Section 2.18 and the Revolving
Credit Commitment of such Lender is not assumed in accordance with subsection
(c) of this Section 2.18 on or prior to the applicable Extension Date, the
Revolving Credit Commitment of such Non-Consenting Lender shall automatically terminate
in whole on such unextended Termination Date without any further notice or
other action by the Borrower, such Lender or any other Person; <u>provided</u>
that such Non-Consenting Lender's rights under Sections 2.11, 2.14 and 8.04,
and its obligations under Section 7.05, shall survive the Termination Date for
such Lender as to matters occurring prior to such date.&nbsp; It is understood and agreed that no Lender
shall have any obligation whatsoever to agree to any request made by the
Borrower for any requested extension of the Termination Date.</p>

<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If less than all of the Lenders consent to any such
request pursuant to subsection (a) of this Section 2.18, the Agent shall
promptly so notify the Consenting Lenders, and each Consenting Lender may, in
its sole discretion, give written notice to the Agent not later than 15 days
prior to the Extension Date of the amount of the Non-Consenting Lenders'
Revolving Credit Commitments for which it is willing to accept an
assignment.&nbsp; If the Consenting Lenders
notify the Agent that they are willing to accept assignments of Revolving
Credit Commitments in an aggregate amount that exceeds the amount of the
Revolving Credit Commitments of the Non-Consenting Lenders, such Revolving
Credit Commitments shall be allocated among the Consenting Lenders willing to
accept such assignments in such amounts as are agreed between the Borrower and
the Agent.&nbsp; If after giving effect to
the assignments of Revolving Credit Commitments described above there remains
any Revolving Credit Commitments of Non-Consenting Lenders, the Borrower may
arrange for one or more Consenting Lenders or other Eligible Assignees (an
&quot;<u>Assuming Lender</u>&quot;) to assume, effective as of the Extension
Date, any Non-Consenting Lender's Revolving Credit Commitment and all of the
obligations of such Non-Consenting Lender under this Agreement thereafter
arising, without recourse to or warranty by, or expense to, such Non-Consenting
Lender; <u>provided</u>, <u>however</u>, that the amount of the Revolving
Credit Commitment of any such Assuming Lender as a result of such substitution
shall in no event be less than $5,000,000 unless the amount of the Revolving
Credit Commitment of such Non-Consenting Lender is less than $5,000,000, in
which case such Assuming Lender shall assume all of such lesser amount; and <u>provided</u>
<u>further</u> that:</p>

<p>(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; any such Consenting Lender or
Assuming Lender shall have paid to such Non-Consenting Lender (A) the aggregate
principal amount of, and any interest accrued and unpaid to the effective date
of the assignment on, the outstanding Advances, if any, of such Non-Consenting
Lender <u>plus</u> (B) any accrued but unpaid facility fees owing to such
Non-Consenting Lender as of the effective date of such assignment;</p>

<p>(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all additional costs reimbursements,
expense reimbursements and indemnities payable to such Non-Consenting Lender,
and all other accrued and unpaid amounts owing to such Non-Consenting Lender
hereunder, as of the effective date of such assignment shall have been paid to
such Non-Consenting Lender; and</p>

<p>(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with respect to any such Assuming
Lender, the applicable processing and recordation fee required under Section
8.07(a) for such assignment shall have been paid;</p>

<p><u>provided</u> <u>further</u> that such Non-Consenting Lender's
rights under Sections 2.11, 2.14 and 8.04, and its obligations under Section
7.05, shall survive such substitution as to matters occurring prior to the date
of substitution.&nbsp; At least three
Business Days prior to any Extension Date, (A) each such Assuming Lender, if
any, shall have delivered to the Borrower and the Agent an agreement (an &quot;<u>Assumption
Agreement</u>&quot;) in form and substance satisfactory to the Borrower and the
Agent, duly executed by such Assuming Lender, such Non-Consenting Lender, the
Borrower and the Agent, (B) any such Consenting Lender shall have delivered
confirmation in writing satisfactory to the Borrower and the Agent as to the
increase in the amount of its Revolving Credit Commitment and (C) each
Non-Consenting Lender being replaced pursuant to this Section 2.18 shall have
delivered to the Agent any Note or Notes held by such Non-Consenting
Lender.&nbsp; Upon the payment or prepayment
of all amounts referred to in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of the immediately
preceding sentence, each such Consenting Lender or Assuming Lender, as of the
Extension Date, will be substituted for such Non-Consenting Lender under this
Agreement and shall be a Lender for all purposes of this Agreement, without any
further acknowledgment by or the consent of the other Lenders, and the
obligations of each such Non-Consenting Lender hereunder shall, by the
provisions hereof, be released and discharged.</p>

<p>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If (after giving effect to any assignments or assumptions
pursuant to subsection (c) of this Section 2.18) Lenders having Revolving

increased by an amount of $25,000,000 or an integral multiple thereof, or such
lesser amount as the Agent may agree, or in the case of an increase within the
first six months after the Effective Date, by an amount of $5,000,000 or an integral
multiple of $500,000 in excess thereof (each a &quot;<u>Commitment Increase</u>&quot;),
to be effective as of a date that is at least 90 days prior to the scheduled
Termination Date then in effect (the &quot;<u>Increase Date</u>&quot;) as
specified in the related notice to the Agent; <u>provided</u>, <u>however</u>
that (i) in no event shall the aggregate amount of the Commitments at any time
exceed $600,000,000, (ii) in no event shall the aggregate amount of the
Commitments and the commitments under the revolving commitments under the
Existing Credit Agreement exceed $1,000,000,000 and (iii) on the date of any

proposed amount of such requested Commitment Increase, (ii) the proposed
Increase Date and (iii) the date by which Lenders wishing to participate in the

in such requested Commitment Increase (each an &quot;<u>Increasing Lender</u>&quot;)
shall, in its sole discretion, give written notice to the Agent on or prior to
the Commitment Date of the amount by which it is willing to increase its
Commitment.&nbsp; If the Lenders notify the
Agent that they are willing to increase the amount of their respective
Commitments by an aggregate amount that exceeds the amount of the requested
Commitment Increase, the requested Commitment Increase shall be allocated among
the Lenders willing to participate therein in such amounts as are agreed
between the Borrower and the Agent.&nbsp;
Notwithstanding the foregoing, for each Commitment Increase occurring
after the Effective Date pursuant to clause (x) of Section 2.19(a), the
Borrower may identify those Persons to which such Commitment Increase will be
available and (x) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the definition of
Eligible Assignee, the Agent shall have no right to approve whether such
Persons become Assuming Lenders in accordance with clause (c) below and (y)
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this clause (b), the Lenders shall
not be able to participate in any such Commitment Increase available to Persons
proposed by the Borrower.</p>

<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Promptly following each Commitment Date, the Agent shall

to participate in the requested Commitment Increase.&nbsp; If the aggregate amount by which the Lenders are willing to
participate in any requested Commitment Increase on any such Commitment Date is
less than the requested Commitment Increase, then the Borrower may extend
offers to one or more Eligible Assignees as Assuming Lenders to participate in
any portion of the requested Commitment Increase that has not been committed to
by the Lenders as of the applicable Commitment Date; <u>provided</u>, <u>however</u>,
that the Commitment of each such Eligible Assignee shall be in an amount of
$5,000,000 or an integral multiple of $500,000 in excess thereof.</p>

<p>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On each Increase Date, each Assuming Lender shall become a
Lender party to this Agreement as of such Increase Date and the Commitment of
each Increasing Lender for such requested Commitment Increase shall be so
increased by such amount (or by the amount allocated to such Lender pursuant to
the last sentence of Section 2.19(b)) as of such Increase Date; <u>provided</u>,
<u>however</u>, that the Agent shall have received on or before such Increase
Date the following, each dated such date:</p>

<p>(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (A) certified copies of resolutions
of the Board of Directors of the Borrower or the Executive Committee of such
Board approving the Commitment Increase and (B) an opinion of counsel for the
Borrower (which may be in-house counsel), in substantially the form of Exhibit
D hereto;</p>

<p>(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an Assumption Agreement from each
Assuming Lender, if any, duly executed by such Assuming Lender, the Agent and
the Borrower; and</p>

<p>(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; confirmation from each Increasing
Lender of the increase in the amount of its Commitment in a writing
satisfactory to the Borrower and the Agent.</p>

<p>On each Increase Date, upon
fulfillment of the conditions set forth in the immediately preceding sentence
of this Section 2.19(d), the Agent shall notify the Lenders (including, without
limitation, each Assuming Lender) and the Borrower, on or before 1:00 P.M. (New
York City time), by telecopier or telex, of the occurrence of the Commitment
Increase to be effected on such Increase Date and shall record in the Register
the relevant information with respect to each Increasing Lender and each
Assuming Lender on such date.</p>

<p>(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the Increase Date, if any Advances are then
outstanding, the Borrower shall borrow&nbsp;
from all or certain of the Lenders and/or (subject to compliance by the
Borrower with Section 8.04(c)) prepay Advances of all or certain of the Lenders
such that, after giving effect thereto, the Advances (including, without
limitation, the Types, currencies and Interest Periods thereof) shall be held
by the Lenders (including for such purposes the Increasing Lenders and the
Assuming Lenders) ratably in accordance with their respective Commitments.&nbsp; On and after each Increase Date, the Pro
Rata Share of each Lender's participation in Letters of Credit and Advances
from draws under Letters of Credit shall be calculated after giving effect to
each such Commitment Increase.</p>

business of extending credit for the purpose of purchasing or carrying margin

date, that on such date (i)&nbsp;the fair value of the property of such Person
is greater than the total amount of liabilities, including, without limitation,

of the assets of such Person is not less than the amount that will be required
to pay the probable liability of such Person on its debts as they become
absolute and matured, (iii)&nbsp;such Person does not intend to, and does not
believe that it will, incur debts or liabilities beyond such Person's ability
to pay such debts and liabilities as they mature and (iv)&nbsp;such Person is
not engaged in business or a transaction, and is not about to engage in
business or a transaction, for which such Person's property would constitute an
unreasonably small capital.&nbsp; The amount
of contingent liabilities at any time shall be computed as the amount that, in
the light of all the facts and circumstances existing at such time, represents
the amount that can reasonably be expected to become an actual or matured
liability.</p>

<p>(j)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No ERISA Event has occurred or is
reasonably expected to occur with respect to any Plan.</p>

change in the funding status of any such Plan since such date.</p>

Affiliate has incurred or is reasonably expected to incur any Withdrawal
Liability to any Multiemployer Plan.</p>

<p>(m)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Neither the Borrower nor any ERISA
Affiliate has been notified by the sponsor of a Multiemployer Plan that such
Multiemployer Plan is in reorganization or has been terminated, within the
meaning of Title&nbsp;IV of ERISA, and no such Multiemployer Plan is reasonably
expected to be in reorganization or to be terminated, within the meaning of
Title&nbsp;IV of ERISA.</p>

<p>(n)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Borrower and each of its
Subsidiaries has good and marketable title to its properties and assets (other
than those properties and assets the loss of which would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect) free and clear of all Liens or
rights of others, except for Liens permitted by Section 5.02(a).</p>

Lenders</u><a name="_Toc29119505"></a>.&nbsp; Each of the Lenders represents to the Agent and each of the

protected in so acting or refraining from acting) upon the instructions of the
Required Lenders, and such instructions shall be binding upon all Lenders and

Agreement entered into by an Assuming Lender as provided in Section 2.18 or
2.19, as the case may be, or an Assignment and Acceptance entered into by such
Lender, as assignor, and an Eligible Assignee, as assignee, as provided in
Section&nbsp;8.07; (ii)&nbsp;may consult with legal counsel (including counsel

responsible to any Lender for the due execution, legality, validity,
enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of, or the perfection or
priority of any lien or security interest created or purported to be created
under or in connection with, this Agreement or any other instrument or document
furnished pursuant hereto; and (vi)&nbsp;shall incur no liability under or in
respect of this Agreement by acting upon any notice, consent, certificate or
other instrument or writing (which may be by telecopier, telegram or telex)

to its Commitment, the Advances made by it and the Note issued to it, Citicorp
shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement as any other Lender
and may exercise the same as though it were not the Agent; and the term
&quot;Lender&quot; or &quot;Lenders&quot; shall, unless otherwise expressly
indicated, include Citicorp in its individual capacity.&nbsp; Citicorp and its Affiliates may accept
deposits from, lend money to, act as trustee under indentures of, accept
investment banking engagements from and generally engage in any kind of
business with, the Borrower, any of its Subsidiaries and any Person who may do
business with or own securities of the Borrower or any such Subsidiary, all as
if Citicorp were not the Agent and without any duty to account therefor to the
Lenders.&nbsp; The Agent shall have no duty
to disclose information obtained or received by it or any of its Affiliates
relating to the Borrower or its Subsidiaries to the extent such information was
obtained or received in any capacity other than as Agent.</p>

<p>SECTION 7.04.&nbsp; <u>Lender Credit Decision</u><u><a name="_Toc29119517"></a></u>.&nbsp; Each Lender
acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Agent or
any other Lender and based on the financial statements referred to in
Section&nbsp;4.01 and such other documents and information as it has deemed
appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this
Agreement.&nbsp; Each Lender also
acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Agent or
any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall deem
appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or
not taking action under this Agreement.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>SECTION 7.05.&nbsp; <u>Indemnification</u><u><a name="_Toc29119518"></a></u>.&nbsp; (a)&nbsp; The Lenders agree to indemnify the Agent (to
the extent not reimbursed by the Borrower), ratably according to the respective
principal amounts of the Advances then owed to each of them (or if no Advances
are at the time outstanding, ratably according to the respective amounts of
their Revolving Credit Commitments), from and against any and all liabilities, obligations,
losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or
disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever that may be imposed on, incurred
by, or asserted against the Agent in any way relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or any action taken or omitted by the Agent under this Agreement
(collectively, the &quot;<u>Indemnified Costs</u>&quot;), <u>provided</u> that
no Lender shall be liable for any portion of the Indemnified Costs resulting
from the Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct.&nbsp; Without limitation of the foregoing, each
Lender agrees to reimburse the Agent promptly upon demand for its ratable share
of any out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable counsel fees) incurred by
the Agent in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery,
administration, modification, amendment or enforcement (whether through
negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice in respect of
rights or responsibilities under, this Agreement, to the extent that the Agent
is not reimbursed for such expenses by the Borrower.&nbsp; In the case of any investigation, litigation or proceeding giving
rise to any Indemnified Costs, this Section&nbsp;7.05 applies whether any such
investigation, litigation or proceeding is brought by the Agent, any Lender or
a third party.</p>

<p>(b)<a
name="_Toc482634049"></a><a name="_Toc483243391">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each Lender
severally agrees to indemnify the Issuing Banks (to the extent not promptly
reimbursed by the Borrower) from and against such Lender's ratable share
(determined as provided below) of any and all liabilities, obligations, losses,
damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements
of any kind or nature whatsoever that may be imposed on, incurred by, or
asserted against any such Issuing Bank in any way relating to or arising out of
this Agreement or any action taken or omitted by such Issuing Bank hereunder or
in connection herewith; <u>provided</u>, <u>however</u><i>,</i> that no Lender shall be liable for any portion of such
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments,
suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from such Issuing Bank's
gross negligence or willful misconduct as found in a final, non-appealable
judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction.&nbsp;
Without limitation of the foregoing, each Lender agrees to reimburse any
such Issuing Bank promptly upon demand for its ratable share of any costs and
expenses (including, without limitation, fees and expenses of counsel) payable
by the Borrower under Section 8.04, to the extent that such Issuing Bank is not
promptly reimbursed for such costs and expenses by the Borrower.</a></p>

<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For purposes of this Section&nbsp;7.05, the Lenders'
respective ratable shares of any amount shall be determined, at any time,
according to the sum of (i)&nbsp;the aggregate principal amount of the Advances
outstanding at such time and owing to the respective Lenders, (ii)&nbsp;their
respective Pro Rata Shares of the aggregate Available Amount of all Letters of
Credit outstanding at such time and (iii)&nbsp;their respective Unused
Commitments at such time; <u>provided</u> that the aggregate principal amount
of Advances owing to the Issuing Banks as a result of drawings under Letters of
Credit shall be considered to be owed to the Lenders ratably in accordance with
their respective Revolving Credit Commitments.&nbsp;
The failure of any Lender to reimburse the Agent or any such Issuing
Bank, as the case may be, promptly upon demand for its ratable share of any
amount required to be paid by the Lenders to such Agent or such Issuing Bank,
as the case may be, as provided herein shall not relieve any other Lender of
its obligation hereunder to reimburse such Agent or Issuing Bank, as the case
may be, for its ratable share of such amount, but no Lender shall be
responsible for the failure of any other Lender to reimburse the Agent or any
such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, for such other Lender's ratable share of
such amount.&nbsp; Without prejudice to the
survival of any other agreement of any Lender hereunder, the agreement and
obligations of each Lender contained in this Section&nbsp;7.05 shall survive
the payment in full of principal, interest and all other amounts payable
hereunder and under the Notes.</p>

<p>SECTION 7.06.&nbsp; <u>Successor Agent</u><u><a name="_Toc29119519"></a></u>.&nbsp; The Agent
may resign at any time by giving written notice thereof to the Lenders and the
Borrower and may be removed at any time with or without cause by the Required
Lenders.&nbsp; Upon any such resignation or
removal, the Required Lenders shall have the right to appoint a successor Agent
with the prior consent of the Borrower (so long as no Event of Default shall
have occurred and be continuing).&nbsp; If no
successor Agent shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders, and shall
have accepted such appointment, within 30 days after the retiring Agent's
giving of notice of resignation or the Required Lenders' removal of the
retiring Agent, then the retiring Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint
a successor Agent, which shall be a commercial bank organized under the laws of
the United States of America or of any State thereof and having a combined
capital and surplus of at least $500,000,000.&nbsp;
Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Agent hereunder by a successor
Agent, such successor Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with
all the rights, powers, discretion, privileges and duties of the retiring
Agent, and the retiring Agent shall be discharged from its duties and
obligations under this Agreement.&nbsp; After
any retiring Agent's resignation or removal hereunder as Agent, the provisions
of this Article&nbsp;VII shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or
omitted to be taken by it while it was Agent under this Agreement.</p>

<p>SECTION 7.07.&nbsp; <u>Sub-Agent</u><u><a name="_Toc29119520"></a></u>.&nbsp; The
Sub-Agent has been designated under this Agreement to carry out duties of the
Agent. &nbsp;The Sub-Agent shall be subject
to each of the obligations in this Agreement to be performed by the Sub-Agent,
and each of the Borrower and the Lenders agrees that the Sub-Agent shall be
entitled to exercise each of the rights and shall be entitled to each of the
benefits of the Agent under this Agreement as relate to the performance of its
obligations hereunder.</p>

hereby acknowledges that no Lender (other than the Agent) designated as any
&quot;Agent&quot; on the signature pages hereof has any liability hereunder
other than in its capacity as a Lender.</p>

such Lender, together with accrued interest thereon to the date of payment of
such principal amount and all other amounts payable to such Lender under this
Agreement, (vi)&nbsp;the parties to each such assignment shall execute and
deliver to the Agent, for its acceptance and recording in the Register, an

assignment made to an Eligible Assignee without the prior consent of the
Borrower (unless an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing)

assignor was then entitled.&nbsp; Upon such
execution, delivery, acceptance and recording, from and after the effective
date specified in each Assignment and Acceptance, (x)&nbsp;the assignee
thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent that rights and
obligations hereunder have been assigned to it pursuant to such Assignment and
Acceptance, have the rights and obligations of a Lender hereunder and

purposes of this Agreement, (iv)&nbsp;the Borrower, the Agent and the other
Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in
connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement and
(v)&nbsp;no participant under any such participation shall have any right to
approve any amendment or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any Note,
or any consent to any departure by the Borrower therefrom, except to the extent
that such amendment, waiver or consent would reduce the principal of, or
interest on, the Notes or any fees or other amounts due and payable hereunder,
in each case to the extent subject to such participation, or postpone any date
fixed for any payment of principal of, or interest on, the Notes or any fees or
other amounts due and payable hereunder, in each case to the extent subject to
such participation.</p>

<p>(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any Lender may, in connection with any assignment or
participation or proposed assignment or participation pursuant to this
Section&nbsp;8.07, disclose to the assignee or participant or proposed assignee
or participant, any information relating to the Borrower furnished to such
Lender by or on behalf of the Borrower; <u>provided</u> that, prior to any such
disclosure, the assignee or participant or proposed assignee or participant
shall agree to preserve the confidentiality of any Confidential Information
relating to the Borrower received by it from such Lender.</p>

<p>(g)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Issuing Bank may assign to an Eligible Assignee its
rights and obligations or any portion of the undrawn Letter of Credit
Commitment at any time; <u>provided</u>, <u>however</u>, that&nbsp; (i) the amount of the Letter of Credit
Commitment of the assigning Issuing Bank being assigned pursuant to each such
assignment (determined as of the date of the Assignment and Acceptance with
respect to such assignment) shall in no event be less than $1,000,000 or an integral
multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof, and (ii) the parties to each such
assignment shall execute and deliver to the Agent, for its acceptance and
recording in the Register, an Assignment and Acceptance, together with a
processing and recordation fee of $3,500.</p>

<p>(h)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notwithstanding any other provision set forth in this
Agreement, any Lender may at any time create a security interest in all or any
portion of its rights under this Agreement (including, without limitation, the
Advances owing to it and any Note or Notes held by it) in favor of any Federal
Reserve Bank in accordance with Regulation A of the Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System.</p>

<p>SECTION 8.08.&nbsp; <u>Confidentiality</u><u><a name="_Toc29119530"></a></u>.&nbsp; Neither the
Agent nor any Lender shall disclose any Confidential Information to any other
Person without the prior written consent of the Borrower, other than
(a)&nbsp;to the Agent's or such Lender's Affiliates and their officers,
directors, employees, agents and advisors and, as contemplated by
Section&nbsp;8.07(f), to actual or prospective assignees and participants, and
then only on a confidential basis, (b)&nbsp;as required by any law, rule or
regulation or judicial process, (c)&nbsp;as requested or required by any state,
federal or foreign authority or examiner regulating banks or banking and (d) in
connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or any suit, action or
proceeding relating to this Agreement or the enforcement of rights hereunder.</p>

<p>SECTION 8.09.&nbsp; <u>Governing Law</u><u><a name="_Toc29119531"></a></u>.&nbsp; This
Agreement and the Notes shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with,
the laws of the State of New&nbsp;York.</p>

<p>SECTION 8.10.&nbsp; <u>Execution in Counterparts</u><u><a name="_Toc29119532"></a></u>.&nbsp; This Agreement
may be executed in any number of counterparts and by different parties hereto
in separate counterparts, each of which when so executed shall be deemed to be
an original and all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same
agreement.&nbsp; Delivery of an executed
counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by telecopier shall be
effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.</p>

<p>SECTION 8.11.&nbsp; <u>Judgment</u><u><a name="_Toc29119533"></a></u>.&nbsp; (a)&nbsp; If for the purposes of obtaining judgment in
any court it is necessary to convert a sum due hereunder in Dollars into
another currency, the parties hereto agree, to the fullest extent that they may
effectively do so, that the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in accordance
with normal banking procedures the Agent could purchase Dollars with such other
currency at Citicorp's principal office in London at 11:00 A.M. (London time)
on the Business Day preceding that on which final judgment is given.</p>

<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any court it
is necessary to convert a sum due hereunder in a Committed Currency into
Dollars, the parties agree to the fullest extent that they may effectively do
so, that the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in accordance with
normal banking procedures the Agent could purchase such Committed Currency with
Dollars at Citicorp's principal office in London at 11:00 A.M. (London time) on
the Business Day preceding that on which final judgment is given.</p>

<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The obligation of the Borrower in respect of any sum due
from it in any currency (the &quot;<u>Primary Currency</u>&quot;) to any Lender
or the Agent hereunder shall, notwithstanding any judgment in any other
currency, be discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day following
receipt by such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be), of any sum adjudged
to be so due in such other currency, such Lender or the Agent (as the case may
be) may in accordance with normal banking procedures purchase the applicable
Primary Currency with such other currency; if the amount of the applicable
Primary Currency so purchased is less than such sum due to such Lender or the
Agent (as the case may be) in the applicable Primary Currency, the Borrower
agrees, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to
indemnify such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) against such loss, and
if the amount of the applicable Primary Currency so purchased exceeds such sum
due to any Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) in the applicable Primary
Currency, such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) agrees to remit to the
Borrower such excess.</p>

<p>SECTION 8.12.&nbsp; <u>Jurisdiction, Etc</u>.<a name="_Toc29119534"></a>&nbsp; (a)&nbsp; Each of the parties hereto hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the
nonexclusive jurisdiction of any New&nbsp;York State court or federal court of
the United States of America sitting in New&nbsp;York City, and any appellate
court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating
to this Agreement or the Notes, or for recognition or enforcement of any
judgment, and each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
agrees that all claims in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard
and determined in any such New&nbsp;York State court or, to the extent
permitted by law, in such federal court.&nbsp;
Each party hereby irrevocably consents to the service of process in any
action or proceeding in such courts by the mailing thereof by any parties
hereto by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested), postage
prepaid, to such party at its address specified pursuant to Section 8.02.&nbsp; Each of the parties hereto agrees that a
final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by law.&nbsp; Nothing in this
Agreement shall affect any right that any party may otherwise have to bring any
action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or the Notes in the courts of
any jurisdiction.</p>

<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each of the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally
waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any
objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit,
action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Notes
in any New&nbsp;York State or federal court.&nbsp;
Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest
extent permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court.</p>

<p>SECTION 8.13.&nbsp; <u>Substitution of Currency</u><u><a name="_Toc29119535"></a></u>.&nbsp; If a change
in any Committed Currency occurs pursuant to any applicable law, rule or
regulation of any governmental, monetary or multi-national authority, this
Agreement (including, without limitation, the definitions of Eurocurrency Rate)
will be amended to the extent determined by the Agent (acting reasonably and in
consultation with the Borrower) to be necessary to reflect the change in
currency and to put the Lenders and the Borrower in the same position, so far
as possible, that they would have been in if no change in such Committed
Currency had occurred.</p>

<p>SECTION 8.14.&nbsp; <u>No Liability of the Issuing Banks</u><u><a
name="_Toc29119536"></a><a name="_Toc530973898"></a><a name="_Toc530929521"></a><a
name="_Toc521755675"></a></u><u>.</u>&nbsp; The Borrower assumes all risks of the acts
or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee of any Letter of Credit with
respect to its use of such Letter of Credit.&nbsp;
Neither an Issuing Bank nor any of its officers or directors shall be
liable or responsible for:&nbsp; (a) the use
that may be made of any Letter of Credit or any acts or omissions of any
beneficiary or transferee in connection therewith; (b) the validity, sufficiency
or genuineness of documents, or of any endorsement thereon, even if such
documents should prove to be in any or all respects invalid, insufficient,
fraudulent or forged; (c) payment by such Issuing Bank against presentation of
documents that do not comply with the terms of a Letter of Credit, including
failure of any documents to bear any reference or adequate reference to the
Letter of Credit; or (d) any other circumstances whatsoever in making or
failing to make payment under any Letter of Credit, except that the Borrower
shall have a claim against such Issuing Bank, and such Issuing Bank shall be
liable to the Borrower, to the extent of any direct, but not consequential,
damages suffered by the Borrower that the Borrower proves were caused by such Issuing
Bank's willful misconduct or gross negligence as determined in a final,
non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction.&nbsp; In furtherance and not in limitation of the
foregoing, such Issuing Bank may accept documents that appear on their face to
be in order, without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of
any notice or information to the contrary.</p>

<p>SECTION 8.15.&nbsp; <u>Waiver of Jury Trial</u><u><a name="_Toc29119537"></a></u>.&nbsp; Each of the
Borrower, the Agent and the Lenders hereby irrevocably waives all right to
trial by jury in any action, proceeding or counterclaim (whether based on
contract, tort or otherwise) arising out of or relating to this Agreement or
the Notes or the actions of the Agent or any Lender in the negotiation,
administration, performance or enforcement thereof.</p>

parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be executed by their respective
officers thereunto duly authorized, as of the date first above written.</p>
