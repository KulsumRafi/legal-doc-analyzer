<PAGE>

DIRECTORS' MATCHING GIFT PROGRAM
     CSX Corporation Directors' Matching Gift Program ("Program") reflects CSX's
commitment to the communities in which the Company and its subsidiaries operate.
As part of its program of corporate philanthropy, the Company contributes
through the Program to education, civic, cultural, and health and human service
programs.

FOR CURRENT DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY
     CSX will match Director contributions from a minimum of $25 to an aggregate
maximum of $25,000 annually to civic, cultural, educational, and health and
human services institutions on a two-for-one basis subject to certain
restrictions. The contributions to be matched must be personal gifts from the
Director's own funds, paid in cash or securities. Pledges do not qualify for
matches.
     The Program is available to all active Directors of the Company.
Individuals who have retired from service as Directors of the Company may
participate in this program through the sixth anniversary of their retirement.
Gifts by participants may be made jointly with their spouses.

ELIGIBLE ORGANIZATIONS
     Gifts are eligible for match only if they fall within the guidelines for
CSX Corporation's charitable contributions.
     To be eligible to receive a match, an organization or institution must
qualify as exempt from taxation pursuant to Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal
Revenue Code.
     Certain restrictions apply to organizations which qualify for the matching
gifts. The following do not fall within the CSX Corporation guidelines for

contributions.
