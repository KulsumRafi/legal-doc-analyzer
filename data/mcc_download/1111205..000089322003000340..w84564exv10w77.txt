      AGREEMENT, dated effective June 16, 2000 by and between Kramont Realty
Trust (the "Company") and George S. Demuth (the "Participant").

                              Preliminary Statement

      The Participant has been granted, subject to execution of this agreement,
under Kramont Realty Trust 2000 Incentive Plan (the "Plan"), an incentive stock
option (the "Option") on (the "Grant Date") to purchase the number of shares of
the Company's common shares of beneficial interest, par value $.01 per share
(the "Shares") set forth below. A copy of the Plan has been delivered to the
Participant. By signing and returning this Agreement, the Participant
acknowledges having received and read a copy of the Plan and agrees to comply
with it, this Agreement and all applicable laws and regulations.

      Accordingly, the parties hereto agree as follows:

      1. Tax Matters. The Option granted hereby is intended to qualify as an
"incentive stock option" under Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended (the "Code"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Option will not
qualify as an "incentive stock option," if among other events, (i) the
Participant disposes of the Shares acquired pursuant to the exercise of the
Option at any time during the two-year period following the date of this
Agreement of the one-year period following the date on which the Option is
exercised or (ii) except in the case of a termination of employment as a result
of death, the Participant is not employed by the Company, any subsidiary or
parent (within the meaning of Code Sections 424(f) and 424(e), respectively) at
all times during the period beginning on the date of this Agreement and ending
on the day three months (or one year in the case of the Participant's disability
(within the meaning of Section 22(e)(3) of the Code)) before the date of
exercise of the Option. To the extent that the Option does not qualify as an
"incentive stock option", it shall constitute a separate, non-qualified stock
option.

      2. Grant of Option. Subject in all respects to the Plan and the terms and
conditions set forth herein, the Participant is hereby granted an Option to
purchase from the Company Shares, at a price per share of $10.16 (the "Option
Price").

      3. Exercise.

      Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b) below, the Option shall
become exercisable in installments on the dates provided below, which shall be
cumulative; provided that the Participant is employed by the Company or any of
its Subsidiary's or Affiliates (together, hereinafter referred to as the
"Employer") as of the applicable date. To the extent that the Option has become
vested and exercisable with respect to a number of Shares granted as provided
below, the Option may thereafter be exercised by the Participant, in whole or in
part, at any time or from time to time prior to the expiration of the Option as
provided herein and in accordance with the provisions of Section 9.3 of the
Plan, including without limitation, by the filing of such written form of
exercise notice, if any, as may be required by the Committee and payment in full
of the Option Price multiplied by the number of Shares so exercised. Upon
expiration of the Option, the Option shall be canceled and no longer
exercisable. The following table indicates the dates (the "Vesting Dates") upon
which the Participant shall be entitled to exercise the Option with respect to
the number of shares granted as indicated beside that date:

of such termination or resignation and all accrued but unpaid bonus compensation

such termination and receive any benefits to which Executive is entitled
thereunder; and (iii) all stock options and other awards subject to vesting
periods not then expired shall immediately become fully vested. Executive shall

and extraordinary other awards and reimbursed expenses;

lump sum payment by the Company (or its successor in interest) in an amount
equal to two (2) times his annual bonus received pursuant to subparagraph 4(b)
during the fiscal year immediately prior to the date of such termination;

                  (iii) Executive shall be entitled to continue the medical,

that coverage can be obtained at commercially reasonable rates), and receive any
benefits to which Executive is entitled thereunder for a period ending on the

date upon which Executive obtains new employment which provides him with such
coverage; and

                  (iv) all stock options and other award subject to vesting
periods not then expired shall, effective upon such Closing, become fully
vested; provided, however, that in no event shall any payment be made under this
subparagraph 6(e) to the extent such payment would constitute an "excess
parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code determined
without regard to Section 280G (b)(4) of the Code. Executive shall have no
obligation to mitigate the Company's severance obligations under this
subparagraph 6(e) and no amounts earned by Executive following such termination
shall be deemed to reduce the payments required under this subparagraph 6(e).

beginning as of the date of termination, at such intervals as the same would
