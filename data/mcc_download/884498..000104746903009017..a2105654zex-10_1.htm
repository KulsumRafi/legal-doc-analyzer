including, without limitation, subsequent approval by the shareholders of the Company of this Plan or any amendments thereto; provided, however, that the option price per share of the Shares covered
by each Option shall not be less than the par value per share of the Common Stock. Each Stock Agreement shall state the number of Shares to which it pertains, the date or dates on which it first is
exercisable, and the date after which it may no longer be exercised. Option rights may accrue or become exercisable in installments over a period of time, or upon the achievement of certain conditions
or the attainment of stated goals or events. Exercise of any Option may be conditioned upon the Participant's execution of a Share purchase agreement in form satisfactory to the Committee providing
for certain protections for the Company and its other shareholders, including requirements that the Participant's or the Participant's Survivors' right to sell or transfer the Shares may be
restricted, and the Participant or the Participant's Survivors may be required to execute letters of investment intent and to acknowledge that the Shares will bear legends noting any applicable

particular Participant or Participants. The Stock Agreement shall contain terms and conditions which the Committee determines to be
appropriate and in the best interest of the Company; provided, however, that the purchase price per share of the Shares covered by each Stock Award shall not be less than the par value per Share. Each
Stock Agreement shall state the number of Shares to which the Stock Award pertains, the date prior to which the Stock Award must be exercised by the Participant, and the terms of any right of the
Company to reacquire the Shares subject to the Stock Award, including the time and events upon which such rights shall accrue and the purchase price therefor, and any restrictions on the
transferability of such Shares. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Stock Right (or any part or installment thereof) shall be exercised by giving written notice to the Company, together with provision for payment of the full
purchase price in accordance with this Section for the Shares as to which such Stock Right is being exercised, and upon compliance with any other conditions set forth in the Stock Agreement. Such
written notice shall be signed by the person exercising the Stock Right, shall state the number of Shares with respect to which the Stock Right is being exercised, and shall contain any representation
required by the Plan or the Stock Agreement. </FONT></P>

delivery of shares of Common Stock already owned by the Participant not subject to any restriction under any plan and having a Fair Market Value equal as of the date of exercise to the cash exercise
price of the Stock Right, (iii)&nbsp;at the discretion of the Committee, by any other means, including a promissory note of the Participant, which the Committee determines to be consistent with the
purpose of this Plan and applicable law, (iv)&nbsp;at the discretion of the Committee, in accordance with a cashless exercise program established with a securities brokerage firm and approved by the
Committee, or (v)&nbsp;at the discretion of the Committee, by any combination of (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv)&nbsp;above. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee shall accept only such payment
on exercise of an ISO as is permitted by Section&nbsp;422 of the Code. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company shall reasonably promptly deliver the Shares as to which such Stock Right was exercised to the Participant (or to the Participant's Survivors, as the case may be). In
determining what constitutes "reasonably promptly," it is expressly understood that the delivery of the Shares may be delayed by the Company in order to comply with any law or regulation which
requires the Company to take any action with respect to the Shares prior to their issuance. The Shares shall, upon delivery, be fully paid, non-assessable Shares. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except as otherwise provided in the pertinent Stock Agreement, in the event of a Termination of Service of a Participant "for cause," all outstanding and
unexercised Stock Rights as of the date the Participant is notified his or her service is terminated "for cause" will immediately be forfeited. For purposes of this Section&nbsp;12, "cause" shall
include (and is not limited to) dishonesty with respect to the Company and its Affiliates, insubordination, substantial malfeasance or nonfeasance of duty, unauthorized disclosure of confidential
information, conduct substantially prejudicial to the business of the Company or any Affiliate, and termination by the Participant in violation of an agreement by the Participant to remain in the
employ </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>or service</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> of the Company or an Affiliate. The determination of the Committee as to the existence of cause will be conclusive on the Participant
and the Company. "Cause" is not limited to events which have occurred prior to a Participant's Termination of Service, nor is it necessary that the Committee's finding of "cause" occur prior to
termination. If the Committee determines, subsequent to a Participant's Termination of Service but prior to the exercise of a Stock Right, that either prior or subsequent to the Participant's
termination the Participant engaged in conduct which would constitute "cause," then the right to exercise any Stock Right shall be forfeited. Any definition in an agreement between a Participant and
the Company or an Affiliate which contains a conflicting definition of "cause" for termination and which is in effect at the time of such termination shall supersede the definition in this Plan with
respect to that Participant. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>13. EFFECT OF TERMINATION OF SERVICE FOR DISABILITY  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except as otherwise provided in the pertinent Stock Agreement, in the event of a Termination of Service by reason of Disability, the Disabled Participant may
exercise any Stock Right granted to him or her to the extent exercisable but not exercised on the date of Disability. A Disabled Participant may exercise such rights only within a period of not more
than one (1)&nbsp;year after the date that the Participant became Disabled or, if earlier, within the originally prescribed term of the Stock Right. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Committee shall make the determination both of whether Disability has occurred and the date of its occurrence (unless a procedure for such determination is set forth in another
agreement between the Company and such Participant, in which case such procedure shall be used for such determination). If requested, the Participant shall be examined by a physician selected or
approved by the Committee, the cost of which examination shall be paid for by the Company. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>14. EFFECT OF DEATH WHILE AN EMPLOYEE  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except as otherwise provided in the pertinent Stock Agreement, in the event of death of a Participant while the Participant is an employee of </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><I>or consultant
to</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> the Company or an Affiliate, any Stock Rights granted to such Participant may be exercised by the Participant's Survivors to the extent
exercisable but not exercised on the date of death. Any such Stock Right must be exercised within one (1)&nbsp;year after the date of death of the Participant. </FONT></P>

(b), or (c)&nbsp;of this Section&nbsp;16 with respect to ISOs shall be made only after the Committee determines whether such adjustments would constitute a "modification" of such ISOs (as that
term is defined in Section&nbsp;424(h) of the Code) or would cause any adverse tax consequences for the holders of such ISOS. If the Committee determines that such adjustments made with respect to
ISOs would constitute a modification of such ISOs, it may refrain from making such adjustments, unless the holder of an ISO specifically requests in writing that such adjustment be made and such
writing indicates that the holder has full knowledge of the consequences of such "modification" on his or her income tax treatment with respect to the ISO. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>17. FRACTIONAL SHARES  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No fractional share shall be issued under the Plan, and the person exercising any Stock Right shall receive from the Company cash in lieu of any such fractional
share equal to the Fair Market Value thereof determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Company. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>18. CONVERSION OF ISOS INTO NON-QUALIFIED OPTIONS; TERMINATION OF ISOS.  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any Options granted under this Plan which do not meet the requirements of the Code for ISOs shall automatically be deemed to be NQSOs without further action on
the part of the Committee. The Committee, at the written request of any Participant, may in its discretion take such actions as may be necessary to convert such Participant's ISOs (or any portion
thereof) that have not been exercised on the date of conversion into NQSOs at any time prior to the expiration of such ISOs, regardless of whether the Participant is an employee of the Company or an
Affiliate at the time of such conversion. Such actions may include, but not be limited to, extending the exercise period or reducing the exercise price of the appropriate installments of such Options.
At the time of such conversion, the Committee (with the consent of the Participant) may impose such conditions on the exercise of the resulting NQSOs as the Committee in its discretion may determine,
provided that such conditions shall not be
inconsistent with this Plan. Nothing in the Plan shall be deemed to give any Participant the right to have such Participant's ISOs converted into NQSOs, and no such conversion shall occur until and
unless the Committee takes appropriate action. The Committee, with the consent of the Participant, may also terminate any portion of any ISO that has not been exercised at the time of such
termination. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event that any federal, state, or local income taxes, employment taxes, Federal Insurance Contributions Act ("FICA") withholdings, or other amounts are
required by applicable law or governmental regulation to be withheld from the Participant's salary, wages, or other remuneration in connection with the exercise of a Stock Right or a Disqualifying
Disposition (as defined in Section&nbsp;20), the Participant shall advance in cash to the Company, or to any Affiliate of the Company which employs or employed the Participant, the amount of such
withholdings unless a different withholding arrangement, including the use of shares of the Company's Common Stock, is authorized by the Committee (and permitted by law); provided, however, that with
respect to persons subject to Section&nbsp;16 of the Exchange Act, any such withholding arrangement shall be in compliance with any applicable provisions of Rule&nbsp;16b-3 promulgated
under Section&nbsp;16 of the Exchange Act. For purposes hereof, the Fair Market Value of any shares withheld for purposes of payroll withholding shall be determined in the manner provided in
Section&nbsp;2 hereof, as of the most recent practicable date prior to the date of exercise. If the Fair Market Value of the shares withheld is less than the amount of payroll withholdings required,
the Participant may be required to advance the difference in cash to the Company or the Affiliate employer. The Committee in its discretion may condition the exercise of an Option for less than the
then Fair Market Value on the Participant's payment of such additional withholding. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each Key Employee who receives an ISO must agree to notify the Company in writing immediately after the Key Employee makes a Disqualifying Disposition of any
Shares acquired pursuant to the exercise of an ISO. A Disqualifying Disposition is any disposition (including any sale) of such shares before the later of (a)&nbsp;two years after the date the Key
Employee was granted the ISO, or (b)&nbsp;one year after the date the Key Employee acquired Shares by exercising the ISO. If the Key Employee has died before such Shares are sold, these holding
period requirements do not apply and no Disqualifying Disposition can occur thereafter. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>21. EFFECTIVE DATE; TERMINATION OF THE PLAN  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Plan shall be effective on June&nbsp;21, 2000, the date it was approved by the Board of Directors. Stock Rights may be granted under the Plan on and after
its effective date; provided, however, that any such Stock Rights shall be null and void if the Plan is not approved by the stockholders of the Company within twelve (12)&nbsp;months after the
effective date. The Plan will terminate on June&nbsp;21, 2010, the date which is ten (10)&nbsp;years from the date of its approval by the Board of Directors. The Plan may be terminated at an
earlier date by vote of the stockholders of the Company; provided, however, that any such earlier termination will not affect any Stock Rights granted or Stock Agreements executed prior to the
effective date of such termination. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>22. AMENDMENT OF THE PLAN  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Plan may be amended by the stockholders of the Company. The Plan may also be amended by the Board of Directors or the Committee, including, without
limitation, to the extent necessary to qualify any or all outstanding Stock Rights granted under the Plan or Stock Rights to be granted under the Plan for favorable federal income tax treatment
(including deferral of taxation upon exercise) as may be afforded incentive stock options under Section&nbsp;422 of the Code, to the extent necessary to ensure the qualification of the Plan under
Rule&nbsp;16b-3 under the Exchange Act, and to the extent necessary to qualify the shares issuable upon exercise of any outstanding Stock Rights granted, or Stock Rights to be granted,
under the Plan for listing on any national securities exchange or quotation in any national automated quotation system of securities dealers. Any amendment approved by the Board of Directors or the
Committee which is of a scope that requires stockholder approval in order to ensure favorable federal income tax treatment for any ISOs or requires stockholder approval in order to ensure the
compliance of the Plan with Rule&nbsp;16b-3 or Section&nbsp;162(m) of the Code shall be subject to obtaining such stockholder approval. No modification or amendment of the Plan shall
adversely affect any rights under a Stock Right previously granted to a Participant without such Participant's consent. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
its discretion, the Committee may amend any term or condition of any outstanding Stock Right, provided (i)&nbsp;such term or condition as amended is permitted by the Plan,
(ii)&nbsp;if the amendment is adverse to the Participant, such amendment shall be made only with the consent of the Participant, (iii)&nbsp;any such amendment of any ISO shall be made only after
the Committee determines whether such amendment would constitute a "modification" of any Stock Right which is an ISO (as that term is defined in Section&nbsp;424(h) of the Code) or would cause any
adverse tax consequences for the holder of such ISO, and (iv)&nbsp;with respect to any Stock Right held by any Participant who is subject to the provisions of Section&nbsp;16(a) of the 1934 Act,
any such amendment shall be made only after the Committee determines whether such amendment would constitute the grant of a new Stock Right. </FONT></P>
