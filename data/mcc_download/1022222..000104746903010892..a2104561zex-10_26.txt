SECTION 4:  COVENANTS

all appropriate actions, and to do, or to cause to be done, all things

to execute and deliver the Transaction Documents to which it is a party in

before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statements with
respect to this Agreement or any of the Transactions and will not issue any such
press release or make any such public statement without the prior consent of the
other Parties, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed, or
conditioned; provided, however, that any Party may, without the prior consent of
the other Parties, issue such press release or make such public statement as may

Party. For purposes of this Section 4.3, the term "Confidential Information"
means (x) written or documentary technical, financial, or business information
identified by the disclosing party with a conspicuous legend indicating that

                                       10
<Page>

                                                CONFIDENTIAL SETTLEMENT MATERIAL

it contains confidential information of the disclosing party and (y) orally or
visually disclosed technical, financial, or business information that is
identified at the time of disclosure as confidential information of the
disclosing party by written notification to the receiving party. Each Party will
hold, and will cause its Affiliates and its and their respective directors,
officers, employees, consultants, advisors, and agents to hold, in confidence
all Confidential Information concerning any other Party obtained in connection
with this Agreement or any Transaction Document and will use any such
Confidential Information only in connection with the Transactions; provided,
however, that any Party may disclose Confidential Information to any Person
whose knowledge of such Confidential Information is necessary to facilitate the
consummation of the Transactions so long as such Person agrees to comply with
the terms of this Section 4.3. Each Party's obligation to hold Confidential
Information in confidence will be satisfied if it exercises the same care with
respect to such Confidential Information as it would exercise to preserve the
confidentiality of its own similar information. Notwithstanding the foregoing
provisions of this Section 4.3, there will be no obligation of confidence or
limitation on use or disclosure as to any Confidential Information that (i) is
or becomes available to the public without breach of the terms of this
Agreement; (ii) is known by the receiving party prior to its receipt by the
disclosing party as Confidential Information hereunder; (iii) is approved for
release by written authorization of the disclosing party; (iv) is lawfully
obtained from a third party who is not subject to a duty of confidentiality; (v)
is disclosed by the disclosing party to a third party without imposing a duty of
confidentiality; (vi) is determined to have been developed independently by the
receiving party by a Person without substantive knowledge of the disclosing
party's information; or (vii) is required to be disclosed in accordance with any
applicable Legal Requirements or by the rules and regulations of any applicable
self-regulatory organization if the Party required to make such disclosure has
used commercially reasonable efforts to notify the disclosing party as far in
advance of the required disclosure as is reasonably practicable under the
circumstances and cooperated in all reasonable respects with the disclosing
party, if requested by the disclosing party and at the expense of the disclosing
party, to obtain a protective order or otherwise seek confidential treatment
with respect to such information.

            (b)    Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 4.3(a), if any
Transaction Document contains specific provisions regarding the treatment of
proprietary or confidential information, then such provisions will apply, and
the provisions of Section 4.3(a) will not apply, with respect to any
Confidential Information disclosed in connection with and governed by the terms
of such Transaction Document.

     4.4    NOTIFICATION OF CERTAIN MATTERS. Each Party will promptly notify the
other Parties of:

            (a)    any notice or other communication of which it has knowledge
alleging that a material consent of any Person is or may be required in
connection with the Transactions other than the Required Consents or the
consents set forth on SCHEDULE 3.2(e);

            (b)    any material notice or other material communication from any
Governmental Authority that is received by it in connection with the
Transactions;

                                       11
<Page>

                                                CONFIDENTIAL SETTLEMENT MATERIAL

            (c)    any Legal Proceeding commenced or, to its knowledge,
threatened against, relating to, involving or otherwise affecting, this
Agreement, any of the Transaction Documents, or any of the Transactions;

            (d)    any event, condition or circumstance of which it has
knowledge that is reasonably likely to have a material adverse impact on the
consummation of the Transactions in a timely manner; or

            (e)    any pending or threatened United States federal, state,
local, municipal or foreign Tax audits, examinations, claims, settlements,
proposed adjustments, assessments or reassessments or related matters that could
reasonably be expected to address the Tax treatment of any of the Transactions.

     4.5    TAX INFORMATION; TRANSFER TAXES. The Parties will cooperate in
providing any information required for any Party to file any Tax returns or
information reports. Except as otherwise provided in this Section 4.5, if the
Closing occurs, the LSAT Parties or Liberty, as appropriate (the "Liberty
Taxpayer"), will pay all sales, use, gross receipts or other transfer Taxes
("Transfer Taxes") incurred as a result of or in connection with the
consummation of any of the Transactions. Lockheed Martin will reimburse the
Liberty Taxpayer for one-half of any Transfer Taxes arising as a result of the
transfer of Astrolink's assets to New Astrolink (as described in Section 2.17)
or the transfer of membership interests in New Astrolink to LSAT (as described
in Section 2.18(a)); provided, however, that Lockheed Martin will not be
responsible for any such Transfer Taxes or other Taxes that are incurred as a
result of or in connection with the Transactions described in Sections 2.17 and
2.18(a) to the extent such Transfer Taxes or other Taxes would have been
incurred if Astro LLC had acquired the Membership Interests of LMGT, NGST, and
TSA in Astrolink; and provided further that if any Transaction Document
(including any of the Settlement Agreements) contains specific provisions
regarding the payment of any Transfer Taxes or other Taxes, then such provisions
will apply, and the provisions of this Section 4.5 will not apply, with respect
to the payment of such Transfer Taxes or other Taxes. If the Closing occurs, the
Liberty Taxpayer will prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed, all
Transfer Tax returns and reports, and will pay all Taxes shown to be due
thereon. Within five Business Days after receipt of a written request by the
Liberty Taxpayer, Lockheed Martin will reimburse the Liberty Taxpayer for
Lockheed Martin's share, as provided in this Section 4.5, of the Transfer Taxes
paid by the Liberty Taxpayer; provided, however, that Lockheed Martin will not
be responsible for any interest or penalties arising as a result of any late or
inaccurate Transfer Tax filings or payments. The Liberty Taxpayer will promptly
repay to Lockheed Martin the portion of any Transfer Tax refunds or credits
(including interest) received by the Liberty Taxpayer that were reimbursed by
Lockheed Martin under this Section 4.5. If the Closing does not occur, any
Transfer Taxes that may be imposed with respect to any of the Transactions will
be paid by the Party legally responsible therefor, and such Party will prepare
and file, or cause to be prepared and filed, all Transfer Tax returns and
reports with respect thereto.

     4.6    TAX REPORTING. None of Astrolink, its successors, or any of its
members will file any return or take a position that for U.S. federal income Tax
purposes Astrolink was engaged in,

                                       12

                                                CONFIDENTIAL SETTLEMENT MATERIAL

or had income which is treated as derived in, the conduct of a trade or business
within the United States during any period during which any of the TPZ Parties
was a member of Astrolink.

     4.7    RESERVATION OF FUNDS FOR THIRD PARTY CREDITORS. Astrolink will
segregate and hold all sums paid to Astrolink by the TPZ Parties under the TPZ
Settlement Agreement (the "TPZ Settlement Funds") separate and will use such
funds solely for the purpose of making settlement payments in respect of
Scheduled Creditor Claims. The Parties hereby waive any right to payment from
the TPZ Settlement Funds or any earnings thereon or proceeds thereof, including
rights to payment under the Interim Loans and the LSAT Subsequent Interim Loans,
and agree not to make any Claims against Astrolink for any TPZ Settlement Funds,
until the earliest to occur of (i) all Scheduled Creditor Claims having been
indefeasibly paid in full, (ii) the Closing, and (iii) termination of this
Agreement.

     4.8    ASTROLINK OBLIGATIONS. None of Astro LLC, LMGT or TSA will incur any
obligation on behalf of Astrolink, or cause or affirmatively permit Astrolink to
incur any obligation which would remain as an unfunded obligation of Astrolink
after the Closing or after termination of this Agreement, without the prior
consent of all members of Astrolink at the time such obligation is incurred.

     4.9    ASTROLINK'S UNIT INCENTIVE PLAN. New Astrolink will not assume the
Unit Incentive Plan or assume or substitute for the Unit Options (as defined in
the Unit Incentive Plan). Astrolink agrees that no later than April 30, 2003 (or
such later date agreed upon by Lockheed Martin and LSAT and specified in a
notice to Astrolink), it will give the notice specified in Section 7.2 of the
Unit Incentive Plan to each participant with outstanding Unit Options as of the
date such notice is sent, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to LSAT
and Lockheed Martin. Astrolink also agrees that it will take all actions
necessary to terminate the Unit Incentive Plan in its entirety prior to the
Closing.

Miscellaneous Creditor Claims included in the ViaSat Settlement Agreement and
the Motorola Settlement Agreement, except Miscellaneous Creditor Claims that are
less than $10,000 individually and $100,000 in the aggregate, on terms and
conditions satisfactory to LSAT in its reasonable discretion.

            (b)    Astrolink shall have received releases from all employees and
independent contractors of Astrolink other than releases relating to Employee
Claims that are in an amount less than $10,000 individually, and $100,000 in the
aggregate, on terms and conditions satisfactory to LSAT in its reasonable
discretion.

            (c)    LSAT shall have received funding for New Astrolink from
investors, third party sources of financing, firm capacity commitments from
prospective customers, or otherwise, satisfactory to LSAT in its sole
discretion.

     6.3    LSAT CLOSING NOTICE. If the conditions in Section 6.1 have been
satisfied or waived by each Party, and LSAT determines in its sole discretion
that all conditions to its obligations to effect the Closing pursuant to Section
6.2 have been satisfied or waives such conditions, LSAT will deliver notice to
that effect to each other Party pursuant to Section 9.2 at any time prior to an
effective termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 7 (the "LSAT
Closing Notice").

SECTION 7:  TERMINATION

     7.1    EVENTS OF TERMINATION. This Agreement may be terminated and the
closing with respect to the applicable Transactions may be abandoned at any time
prior to the Closing:

            (a)    by mutual written consent of the Parties (other than any of
the Astrolink Parties or New Astrolink); or

            (b)    by LSAT, at any time by delivering written notice of
termination to each other Party pursuant to Section 9.2 (a "Termination
Notice").

     7.2    AUTOMATIC TERMINATION. This Agreement will be terminated and the
Closing with respect to the applicable Transactions will be abandoned if the
Closing has not occurred on or before October 31, 2003.

     7.3    EFFECT OF TERMINATION. In the event of termination of this Agreement
and abandonment of the Closing with respect to the applicable Transactions
pursuant to Section 7.1 or Section 7.2, this Agreement will become null and void
and no Party will have any liability or any further obligation to any Person
under this Agreement arising hereunder or in connection with such Transactions
contemplated hereby, except that no Party will be relieved from liability for
any breach by it of this Agreement or of any Transaction Document to which it is
a party, and the Parties' respective obligations under this Section 7 will
remain in full force and effect in accordance with their terms. For avoidance of
doubt, termination of this Agreement will not terminate the Transaction
Documents previously executed and delivered by the parties thereto, including
the Settlement Agreements, the NGST Redemption Agreement, the TPZ Redemption
Agreement and the LSAT Plan B Agreement.

     7.4    FCC AUTHORIZATIONS. Immediately upon termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 7.1 or Section 7.2, and in any event prior to the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the LSAT Plan B Agreement,
Astrolink will abandon its FCC Authorizations.

     7.5    PROCUREMENT CONTRACTS. Immediately upon termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1 or Section 7.2, and in any event prior to the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the LSAT Plan B Agreement,
Astrolink will terminate for convenience the New NGST Procurement Contract and
the New Lockheed Martin Procurement Contract. Astrolink will have no obligations
under the New NGST Procurement Contract upon or after such termination for
convenience, except those relative to the relinquishment of its rights in and to
any work in progress thereunder. The Parties who are parties to such contracts
acknowledge that the terms of the New NGST Procurement Contract have not been
disclosed to the Lockheed Martin Parties, and that the terms of the New Lockheed
Martin Procurement Contract have not been disclosed to NGST. LSAT, NGST and
Astrolink each represents and warrants that the New NGST Procurement Contract
provides that upon a termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1 or
7.2, Astrolink will have the right to terminate the New NGST Procurement
Contract for convenience with immediate effect by written notice to NGST and
without any other action (other than, as termination liability thereunder, the
relinquishment of rights to work in progress and the execution and delivery of
any documents reasonably requested by NGST to evidence Astrolink's
relinquishment of rights or claims in and to the work in progress), payment or
notice period and Astrolink will not have any further obligations under the New
NGST Procurement Contract (other than obligations with respect to
confidentiality and non-disclosure of the type that typically survive such an
agreement). Additionally, Astrolink represents and warrants that the New NGST
Procurement Contract provides that upon a termination of such agreement as
provided in the proceeding sentence in connection with a termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1 or Section 7.2, Astrolink will have no right
or claim to or against the work in progress under the New NGST Procurement
Contract and the Old Lockheed Martin/NGST Subcontract.

     7.6    BREWSTER LEASE AND BREWSTER PRODUCTS. If this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to Section 7.1 or Section 7.2, each of LMGT and Astro LLC
will use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to cause Astrolink to
fulfill its obligations to assign all its rights in the Brewster Products (as
defined in the TPZ Settlement Agreement) and the Brewster Lease (as defined in
the TPZ Settlement Agreement) pursuant to the TPZ Settlement Agreement as and
when such obligations are required to be performed. Upon any termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1 or Section 7.2, Lockheed Martin and LSAT each
agrees to release, and to cause each of its Affiliates to release, any and all
liens, claims and encumbrances on the Brewster Lease or any Brewster Product,
and to file any documents reasonably requested by TPZ to effect or evidence such
release.

     7.7    EMPLOYEE TERMINATION. In the event of termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 7.1 or 7.2:

            (a)    Astrolink will provide notice of termination of employment to
each remaining employee of Astrolink, with each such termination of employment
effective not later than 60 days after termination of this Agreement (each such
date, an "Employee Termination Date"); provided, however, that Astrolink may
extend any Employee Termination Date up to an additional 30 days with respect to
the applicable employee. During the period of time from the date of termination
of this Agreement through the latest Employee Termination Date hereunder,
Lockheed Martin will not cause Astrolink to take any action to reduce the
salaries or benefits of employees of Astrolink from those in effect immediately
prior to the date of this Agreement or to amend the Severance Plans or the
Severance Trust in any manner materially adverse to the current or former
employees of Astrolink.

            (b)    The members of Astrolink at the time of termination of this
Agreement will cause Astrolink to amend the Severance Plans, effective upon such
termination, to provide that Astrolink will pay the entire amount of severance
payments of any employee who remains employed by Astrolink at the date of such
amendment in a lump sum (including the initial lump sum and all monthly
payments) on the Employee Termination Date of such employee, and to eliminate
from each of the Severance Plans the provision which reserves the right to
amend, suspend or terminate such plan, until March 31, 2004. Further, Astrolink
will request that the trustee enter into an amendment to the Severance Trust
extending the earliest termination date thereof from December 31, 2003 to March
31, 2004, and will execute and deliver such amendment if acceptable to the
trustee.

            (c)    In accordance with applicable law, Astrolink and its
subsidiaries (domestic and foreign) (the "Astrolink Entities") will accept the
resignations of all officers and directors of the Astrolink Entities who are
current or former Astrolink employees, and LMGT will cause the Astrolink
Entities to promptly replace such current or former employees as officers and/or
directors of such Astrolink Entities.

SECTION 8:  SURVIVAL; INDEMNIFICATION

     8.1    SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, COVENANTS AND AGREEMENTS.
The respective representations, warranties, covenants, and agreements of the
Parties contained in this

                                       16
<Page>

                                                CONFIDENTIAL SETTLEMENT MATERIAL

Agreement or in any of the Transaction Documents delivered prior to or at the
Closing will survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
notwithstanding any investigation made or information obtained by the other
Parties, and also will survive the Closing and the LMII Contribution Closing,
except to the extent that any Transaction Document specifically provides
otherwise.

     8.2    GENERAL INDEMNIFICATION. Except for claims covered under
Section 8.3, each Party will indemnify and hold harmless the other Parties
(other than another Party that is an Affiliate of such Party) (and their
directors, officers, employees, and Affiliates) from and against and with
respect to, and shall reimburse such Parties and their directors, officers,
employees, and Affiliates for, any and all losses, liabilities, obligations, and
damages ("Losses") resulting from, based upon, arising out of, or otherwise in
respect of, and all claims, actions, suits, proceedings, demands, judgments,
assessments, fines, interest, penalties, costs, and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) ("Claims") incident or relating to or
resulting from any untrue representation, breach of warranty, or breach or
nonfulfillment of any covenant or agreement made herein, or in any Transaction
Document other than the New Lockheed Martin Procurement Contract and the New
NGST Procurement Contract, or certificate delivered pursuant hereto, by the
Party from whom indemnification is claimed (the "Indemnifying Party").

     8.3    SPECIFIC INDEMNIFICATION. Except as specifically provided otherwise
herein or in any Transaction Document, from and after the Closing, New Astrolink
and LSAT, jointly and severally, will indemnify and hold harmless Astrolink,
LMGT, TSA, NGST, and Astro LLC from and against and with respect to, and will
reimburse LMGT, TSA, NGST, and Astro LLC and their directors, officers,
employees, and Affiliates for any and all Losses resulting from, based upon,
arising out of, or otherwise in respect to, and all Claims incident or relating
to or resulting from any of the Assumed Liabilities.

     8.4    INDEMNIFICATION PROCEDURES The procedure for indemnification will be
as follows:

            (a)    The Party claiming indemnification (the "Claimant") will
promptly give written notice to the Indemnifying Party of any pending or
threatened claim, action, suit, investigation, or proceeding brought by a third
party (a "Third Party Action"), specifying (i) the factual basis for such claim,
including copies of any documents relating to the claim, and (ii) the amount of
the claim. Such notice will be given by the Claimant within ten Business Days
after written notice of the assertion or commencement thereof was given to the
Claimant, but failure to give timely notice will not affect the indemnities
given hereunder except to the extent that such failure actually prejudices the
Indemnifying Party in defending against any such claim.

            (b)    If a Claimant gives notice to the Indemnifying Party of a
Third Party Action, the Indemnifying Party will be entitled to participate
therein and, if it so desires, to assume the defense thereof with counsel
reasonably satisfactory to the Claimant and, after notice from the Indemnifying
Party to the Claimant of its election to assume the defense thereof, except as
provided below, the Indemnifying Party will not be liable to such Claimant under
this Section 8.4 for any fees of other counsel or any other expenses, in each
case subsequently incurred by such Claimant in connection with the defense
thereof, other than reasonable costs of

                                       17
<Page>

                                                CONFIDENTIAL SETTLEMENT MATERIAL

investigation. Notwithstanding an Indemnifying Party's election to assume the
defense of a Third Party Action, the Claimant will have the right to employ
separate counsel and to participate in the defense of such Third Party Action,
and the Indemnifying Party will bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of
such separate counsel if: (i) the use of counsel chosen by the Indemnifying
Party to represent the Claimant would present such counsel with a conflict of
interest, (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such
Third Party Action include both the Indemnifying Party and the Claimant, and the
Claimant reasonably concludes that there may be legal defenses available to it
which are different from or additional to those available to the Indemnifying
Party (in which case the Indemnifying Party will not have the right to assume
the defense of such claim on the Claimant's behalf), (iii) the Indemnifying
Party has not employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Claimant to
represent the Claimant within a reasonable time after notice of the Third Party
Action, or (iv) the Indemnifying Party authorizes the Claimant to employ
separate counsel at the Indemnifying Party's expense. If an Indemnifying Party
assumes the defense of a claim, no compromise or settlement thereof may be
effected by the Indemnifying Party without the Claimant's written consent unless
(x) there is no finding or admission of any violation of law by the Claimant and
no effect on any other claims that may be made against the Claimant, (y) there
is a full and unconditional release of the Claimant, and (z) the sole relief
sought is monetary damages that are to be paid in full by the Indemnifying
Party.

            (c)    If any Claimant should have a claim against any Indemnifying
Party hereunder that does not involve a Third Party Action, the Claimant will as
promptly as is practical notify the Indemnifying Party of such claim, describing
such claim, the amount thereof (if known), and the method of computation of the
amount of the claim, all with reasonable particularity. The failure to give any
such notice will not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder
except to the extent that such failure results in actual material prejudice to
the Indemnifying Party. Upon the giving of such written notice as aforesaid, the
Claimant will have the right to enforce its rights under this Section 8.

            (d)    The provisions of this Section 8 are intended to be for the
benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each Claimant and its successors in
interest.

SECTION 9:  MISCELLANEOUS

     9.1    EXPENSES. Whether or not the Transactions are consummated, each
Party will bear its own expenses, including the fees and expenses of any
attorneys, accountants, investment bankers, or other Persons engaged by it,
incurred in connection with this Agreement, the Transaction Documents, or the
Transactions.

     9.2    NOTICES. All notices, requests, demands, or other communications
required by or otherwise with respect to this Agreement or any Transaction
Document must be in writing and will be deemed to have been duly given to any
Party when delivered personally (by courier service or otherwise), when
delivered by telecopy and confirmed by return telecopy, or upon receipt after
being mailed by first-class mail, postage prepaid and return receipt requested

relief as such court may deem just and proper in order to enforce this Agreement
or any Transaction Document or prevent any violation hereof or thereof and, to
the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, each Party waives any
objection to the imposition of such relief.

     9.7    REMEDIES CUMULATIVE. All rights, powers, and remedies provided under
this Agreement or any Transaction Document or otherwise available in respect
hereof or thereof at law or in equity will be cumulative and not alternative,
and the exercise or beginning of the exercise of any thereof by any Party will
not preclude the simultaneous or later exercise of any other such right, power,
or remedy by such Party.

     9.8    NO WAIVER. The failure of any Party to exercise any right, power, or
remedy provided under this Agreement or any Transaction Document or otherwise
available in respect hereof or thereof at law or in equity, or to insist upon
compliance by any other Party with its obligations hereunder or thereunder, and
any custom or practice of the Parties at variance with the terms hereof or
thereof, will not constitute a waiver by such Party of its right to exercise any
such or other right, power, or remedy or to demand such compliance.

     9.9    NO THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARIES. Neither this Agreement nor any
Transaction Document is intended to be for the benefit of and will not be
enforceable by any Person who is not a party to this Agreement or such
Transaction Document, as applicable.

     9.10   JURISDICTION. Except as may be otherwise specifically provided in
any Transaction Document, each Party hereby irrevocably submits to the
non-exclusive jurisdiction of the federal courts of the United States located in
the City of New York, New York, U.S.A., in any action, suit, or proceeding
arising in connection with this Agreement and the Transaction Documents, and
waives (and agrees not to assert) any objection based on FORUM NON CONVENIENS or
any other objection to venue therein; provided, however, that such consent to
jurisdiction is solely for the purpose referred to in this Section 9.10 and will
not be deemed to be a general submission to the jurisdiction of such courts or
in the State of New York, U.S.A. other than for such purpose. Each Party hereby
waives any right to a trial by jury in connection with any such action, suit, or
proceeding. Service of process with respect to any such action, suit, or
proceeding may be made upon any Party by mailing a copy thereof by registered or
certified mail, postage prepaid, to such Party at its address as provided in
Section 9.2, provided that service of process also may be accomplished in any
other manner permitted by applicable Legal Requirements.

     9.11   GOVERNING LAW. Except as may be otherwise specifically provided in
any Transaction Document, this Agreement and the Transaction Documents and all
disputes hereunder will be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance
with the internal laws of the State of New York, U.S.A., applicable to contracts
made and to be performed within that State.

     9.12   GOVERNING LANGUAGE. This Agreement and the Transaction Documents
will be executed in English only, and no translation thereof into any other
language will be binding on the Parties or consulted in order to interpret this
Agreement or any Transaction Document.

     9.13   HEADINGS. The names assigned this Agreement and the Transaction
Documents and the section captions used herein and therein are for convenience
of reference only and will not affect the interpretation or construction of this
Agreement or any Transaction Document. Unless otherwise specified, (a) the terms

executed in any number of counterparts, each of which will be deemed to be an
original, but all of which together will constitute one instrument. Each
counterpart may consist of a number of copies each signed by less than all, but
together signed by all, the Parties. A signature on a counterpart copy of this
Agreement or any Transaction Document transmitted in facsimile form shall
constitute an original executed copy of the same.

     9.15   SEVERABILITY. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced by applicable law or public
policy, all other terms and provisions of this Agreement will nevertheless
remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of
the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any Party.

     9.16   FURTHER ASSURANCES. Each of the Parties will execute and deliver,
without additional consideration, such other documents and instruments of
further assurance as may be reasonably necessary to give effect to the
provisions of this Agreement and the Transaction Documents. Each Party will act
in good faith to take, and to cause any Person that is an Affiliate of such
Party that such Party controls (as defined in the definition of Affiliate) but
that is not a Party to take, all actions reasonably required to cause the
Transactions to be consummated, including executing any Transaction Documents,
in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement if such action by
such Party or any such Affiliate would be appropriate to carry out the purpose
and intent of the Transactions and this Agreement.

     9.17   ATTORNEYS' FEES. In the event of any action, suit, or proceeding
based on or arising out of any alleged breach by any Party of any
representation, warranty, covenant, or agreement contained in this Agreement or
in any Transaction Document, the prevailing Party or Parties will be entitled to
recover reasonable attorneys' fees and other costs associated with such action,
suit, or proceeding from any Party determined to have breached any provision of
this Agreement or any Transaction Document.

     9.18   TIME. Time is of the essence under this Agreement and the
Transaction Documents. If the giving of any notice or the performance of any act
required or permitted under this Agreement or any Transaction Document falls on
a day that is not a Business Day, the time for giving such notice or performing
such act will be extended to the next succeeding Business Day.

     9.19   CONSTRUCTION. This Agreement and the Transaction Documents have been
negotiated by the Parties and their respective legal counsel, and legal or
