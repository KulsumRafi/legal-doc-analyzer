upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Blackman Purchase Agreement,
to issue and sell to the Initial  Purchasers  (a) an aggregate of 100,000 shares
(collectively,  the "BLACKMAN  SHARES";  and,  together with the Company Shares,

         WHEREAS,  in order to induce the  Initial  Purchasers  to  execute  and

registration  rights under the Securities Act and  applicable  state  securities
laws with respect to the Shares and the Option Shares.

         NOW,  THEREFORE,  in  consideration  of the  premises  and  the  mutual
covenants  contained  herein  and other  good and  valuable  consideration,  the
receipt and  sufficiency of which are hereby  acknowledged,  the Company and the
Initial Purchasers hereby agree as follows:

                                    ARTICLE I

                                   DEFINITIONS

         1.3  "PURCHASERS"  means  the  Initial  Purchasers  and  any  of  their
Permitted  Transferees  who  agree to  become  bound by the  provisions  of this
Agreement in accordance with Article IX hereof.

sold  pursuant to the  Purchase  Agreements,  any other  shares of Common  Stock
beneficially owned by the Purchasers (including,  without limitation,  shares of

or convertible securities issued by the Company) and any shares of capital stock
issued or issuable from time to time (with any  adjustments)  in exchange for or
otherwise with respect to the Shares,  the Option Shares and any other shares of
Common Stock beneficially owned by the Purchasers; PROVIDED that the Shares, the
Option  Shares and any other  shares of Common Stock  beneficially  owned by the
Purchasers  will cease to be  Registrable  Securities  at such time as they have
been sold under the Registration Statement or pursuant to Rule 144.

         1.5  "REGISTRATION  PERIOD"  means the period  between the date of this
Agreement  and the  date on  which  all of the  Registrable  Securities  (in the

Securities to be sold, pursuant to Rule 144 or otherwise.

         1.6  "REGISTRATION  STATEMENT"  means a  Registration  Statement of the

         1.7  The terms "REGISTER," "REGISTERED," and "REGISTRATION"  refer to a
registration  effected  by  preparing  and filing a  Registration  Statement  or
statements in compliance  with the  Securities  Act and pursuant to Rule 415 and
the declaration or ordering of effectiveness of such  Registration  Statement by
the Commission.

         1.8 "RULE 144" means Rule 144 under the  Securities  Act or any similar
or successor  rule or regulation of the  Commission  that may at any time permit
the  Purchasers  to  sell  securities  of  the  Company  to the  public  without
registration.

         1.9  "RULE  415"  means  Rule 415  under  the  Securities  Act,  or any
successor  Rule  providing for offering  securities on a continuous  basis,  and
applicable rules and regulations thereunder.


                                   ARTICLE II

                                  REGISTRATION

         2.1 MANDATORY REGISTRATION. The Company will file with the Commission a
Registration  Statement on Form S-3 registering  the Registrable  Securities for
resale  within one hundred and twenty  (120) days after the Closing  Date of the
purchase of the Shares, the


                                       2
<PAGE>

Options and the Option Shares under the Purchase Agreements.  If Form S-3 is not
available at that time,  then the Company will file a Registration  Statement on
such form as is then  available  to  effect a  registration  of the  Registrable
Securities, subject to the consent of the Initial Purchasers, which consent will
not be unreasonably withheld.

         2.2  EFFECTIVENESS OF THE REGISTRATION STATEMENT.  The Company will use
its best efforts to cause the Registration Statement to be declared effective by
the  Commission as soon as practicable  after filing,  and in any event no later
than the 150th  day after the  Closing  Date (the  "REQUIRED  EFFECTIVE  DATE").
However,  so long as the Company  filed the  Registration  Statement  within one
hundred  and twenty  (120)  days after the  Closing  Date,  if the  Registration
Statement receives  Commission review,  then the Required Effective Date will be
the 180th day after the Closing Date.  The Company's  best efforts will include,
but not be limited to,  promptly  responding  to all comments  received from the
staff  of  the  Commission.  If  the  Company  receives  notification  from  the
Commission that the Registration Statement will receive no action or review from
the Commission,  then the Company will request that the  Registration  Statement
become effective promptly after such Commission notification.

         2.3  PIGGYBACK REGISTRATIONS.

         (a) If, at any time prior to the expiration of the Registration Period,
a  Registration  Statement has not become  effective  with respect to all of the
Registrable  Securities or has become  effective and is no longer  effective and
the Company decides to register any of its securities for its own account or for
the  account of others,  then the  Company  will  promptly  give the  Purchasers
written  notice  thereof  and will  use its  best  efforts  to  include  in such
registration  all or any part of the  Registrable  Securities  requested by such
Purchasers  to  be  included  therein  (excluding  any  Registrable   Securities
previously  included in a Registration  Statement).  This  requirement  does not
apply to Company  registrations on Form S-4 or S-8 or their equivalents relating
to equity  securities to be issued solely in connection  with an  acquisition of
any entity or business or equity  securities  issuable in connection  with stock
option or other employee benefit plans or to registration  statements that would
otherwise  not  permit  the   registration  of  resales  of  previously   issued
securities.  Each  Purchaser must give its request for  registration  under this
paragraph to the Company in writing  within fifteen (15) days after receipt from
the Company of notice of such  pending  registration.  If the  registration  for
which the Company gives notice is a public offering  involving an  underwriting,
the Company will so advise the Purchasers as part of the above-described written
notice.  In that event,  if the managing  underwriter(s)  of the public offering
impose a limitation on the number of shares of Common Stock that may be included
in the Registration  Statement because, in such underwriter(s)'  judgment,  such
limitation  would be necessary to effect an orderly public  distribution,  then,
subject to the next sentence, the Company will be obligated to include only such
limited  portion,  if any, of the  Registrable  Securities with respect to which
such Purchasers have requested inclusion hereunder. Any exclusion of Registrable
Securities  will be made pro rata among all holders of the Company's  securities
seeking to include  shares of Common Stock in proportion to the number of shares
of Common Stock sought to be included by those holders;  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  if
the  Company  is  registering  securities  for its  own  account,  the pro  rata
exclusion  among the  holders  seeking to include  shares of Common  Stock shall
apply after the Company has registered all of the securities  that it is able to
register.


                                       3
<PAGE>

         (b)   No right to registration  of Registrable  Securities  under  this
Section 2.3 limits in any way the registration required under Section 2.1 above.

         2.4   ELIGIBILITY TO USE FORM S-3. The Company  represents and warrants
that, as of the date of this Agreement, it meets the requirements for the use of
Form S-3 for  registration  of the resale by the  Purchasers of the  Registrable
Securities.  The  Company  will  file all  reports  required  to be filed by the
Company with the Commission in a timely manner so as to preserve its eligibility
for the use of Form S-3.


                                  ARTICLE III

                      ADDITIONAL OBLIGATIONS OF THE COMPANY

         3.1  CONTINUED EFFECTIVENESS OF REGISTRATION STATEMENT.  Subject to the
limitations  set forth in Section  3.6, the Company will use its best efforts to
keep the Registration  Statement covering the Registrable  Securities  effective
under Rule 415 at all times during the  Registration  Period.  In the event that
the number of shares available under a Registration  Statement filed pursuant to
this  Agreement  is  insufficient  to cover  all of the  Registrable  Securities
issued, the Company will (if permitted) amend the Registration Statement or file
a  new  Registration  Statement  (on  the  short  form  available  therefor,  if
applicable),  or both,  so as to cover all of the  Registrable  Securities.  The
Company  will file  such  amendment  or new  Registration  Statement  as soon as
practicable.  The Company will use its best  efforts to cause such  amendment or
new Registration  Statement to become effective as soon as is practicable  after
the filing thereof.

         3.2  ACCURACY  OF  REGISTRATION  STATEMENT.  Assuming  the  accuracy of
information  furnished  by or on  behalf  of the  Purchasers,  any  Registration
Statement  (including  any amendments or  supplements  thereto and  prospectuses
contained therein) filed by the Company covering Registrable Securities will not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
required to be stated therein,  or necessary to make the statements  therein, in
light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading.  The Company
will  prepare  and  file  with  the  Commission   such   amendments   (including
post-effective amendments) and supplements to the Registration Statement and the
prospectus  used  in  connection  with  the  Registration  Statement  as  may be
necessary to permit sales  pursuant to the  Registration  Statement at all times
during the  Registration  Period (but subject to Section 3.6),  and, during such
period,  will comply with the  provisions of the  Securities Act with respect to
the  disposition  of all  Registrable  Securities of the Company  covered by the
Registration  Statement until the termination of the Registration  Period, or if
earlier,  until  such  time  as all of such  Registrable  Securities  have  been
disposed of in accordance with the intended methods of disposition by the seller
or sellers thereof as set forth in the Registration Statement.

         3.3  FURNISHING  DOCUMENTATION.   The  Company  will  furnish  to  each
Purchaser whose Registrable Securities are included in a Registration Statement,
or to its legal  counsel,  (a)  promptly  after each  document is filed with the
Commission,  one (1) copy of any  Registration  Statement filed pursuant to this
Agreement and any amendments thereto,  each preliminary  prospectus (if any) and
final prospectus and each amendment or supplement  thereto;  and (b) a number of
copies of a prospectus,  including a preliminary  prospectus  (if any),  and all


                                       4
<PAGE>

amendments and  supplements  thereto,  and such other documents as the Purchaser
may reasonably request in order to facilitate the disposition of the Registrable
Securities owned by the Purchaser. The Company will promptly notify by facsimile
each Purchaser  whose  Registrable  Securities are included in any  Registration
Statement  of  the   effectiveness  of  the   Registration   Statement  and  any
post-effective amendment.

         3.4  ADDITIONAL  OBLIGATIONS.  The Company will use its best efforts to
(a) register and qualify the  Registrable  Securities  covered by a Registration
Statement under such other securities or blue sky laws of such  jurisdictions as
each Purchaser who holds (or has the right to hold) Registrable Securities being
offered  reasonably  requests,  (b) prepare and file in those  jurisdictions any
amendments  (including  post-effective   amendments)  and  supplements  to  such
registrations  and   qualifications  as  may  be  necessary  to  maintain  their
effectiveness  during  the  Registration  Period,  (c)  take any  other  actions
necessary to maintain such  registrations  and  qualifications  in effect at all
times during the Registration  Period, and (d) take any other actions reasonably
necessary or advisable to qualify the  Registrable  Securities  for sale in such
jurisdictions.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,  the Company is not required,  in
connection such  obligations,  to (i) qualify to do business in any jurisdiction
where it would not  otherwise  be required to qualify but for this  Section 3.4,
(ii) subject itself to general taxation in any such  jurisdiction,  (iii) file a
general  consent to service of process in any such  jurisdiction or (iv) provide
any undertakings that cause material expense or burden to the Company.

         3.5  UNDERWRITTEN  OFFERINGS.  If the Purchasers who hold a majority in
interest of the Registrable  Securities being offered in an offering pursuant to
a  Registration  Statement or any  amendment or  supplement  thereto  under this
Agreement  select  underwriters  reasonably  acceptable  to the Company for such
offering,  the  Company  will enter into and perform  its  obligations  under an
underwriting   agreement  in  usual  and  customary  form   including,   without
limitation,  customary  indemnification and contribution  obligations,  with the
managing underwriter of such offering.

         3.6  SUSPENSION OF RESALE RIGHTS.

         (a)  The Company will notify (by telephone  and also by  facsimile  and
reputable  overnight  courier) each Purchaser who holds  Registrable  Securities
being sold pursuant to a Registration Statement of the happening of any event of
which the Company has knowledge as a result of which the prospectus  included in
the  Registration  Statement as then in effect includes an untrue statement of a
material fact or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements  therein,  in light of the circumstances  under
which they were made, not misleading. The Company will make such notification as
promptly as practicable  after the Company becomes aware of the event (but in no
event,  without the prior  written  consent of the  Purchaser,  will the Company
disclose to any Purchaser any of the facts or circumstances  regarding the event
(other  than to the  Observer  and the  Conning  Designee  so long as Conning is
exercising  such  rights  pursuant  to the Company  Purchase  Agreement)),  will
promptly  prepare a supplement  or amendment  to the  Registration  Statement to
correct such untrue  statement or omission,  and will deliver a number of copies
of such  supplement  or  amendment  to each  Purchaser  as  such  Purchaser  may
reasonably request.


                                       5
<PAGE>

         (b)  Notwithstanding  the obligations  under Section 3.6(a),  if in the
good faith judgment of the Company,  following  consultation with legal counsel,
it would be  detrimental  to the  Company  and its  shareholders  for resales of
Registrable  Securities to be made pursuant to the Registration Statement due to
(i) the existence of a material  development or potential  material  development
involving  the Company  which the Company  would be obligated to disclose in the
Registration  Statement,  which  disclosure  would  be  premature  or  otherwise
inadvisable  at such  time or would  have a  Material  Adverse  Effect  upon the
Company and its shareholders, or (ii) in the good faith judgment of the Board of
Directors,  it would  adversely  affect or require  premature  disclosure of the
filing  of  a  Company-initiated   registration  of  any  class  of  its  equity
securities, the Company, in each case, will have the right to suspend the use of
the  Registration  Statement until the earlier of (x) the event or circumstances
requiring the suspension of use the Registration Statement is no longer existing
or  occurring  or (y) a period  of not more than  thirty  (30)  days;  PROVIDED,
HOWEVER,  that the Company  may so defer or suspend the use of the  Registration
Statement no more than three times in any  eighteen-month  period, and PROVIDED,
FURTHER,  that,  after  deferring  or  suspending  the  use of the  Registration
Statement,  the  Company  may  not  again  defer  or  suspend  the  use  of  the
Registration  Statement until a period of two hundred and seventy (270) days has
elapsed after resumption of the use of the Registration Statement.

         (c) Subject to the Company's rights under this Article III, the Company
will use its best  efforts to prevent  the  issuance  of any stop order or other
suspension of effectiveness of a Registration Statement and, if such an order is
issued,  will use its best  efforts  to  obtain  the  withdrawal  of such  order
(subject to the Company's right to contest such order) at the earliest  possible
time and to notify each Purchaser that holds  Registrable  Securities being sold
(or, in the event of an underwritten offering, the managing underwriters) of the
issuance of such order and the resolution thereof.

         (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in the
Purchase  Agreements,  if the use of the Registration  Statement is suspended by
the Company,  the Company will  promptly  give notice of the  suspension  to all
Purchasers whose securities are covered by the Registration Statement,  and will
promptly  notify  each  such  Purchaser  as soon as the use of the  Registration
Statement may be resumed.

         3.7  REVIEW BY THE PURCHASERS. The Company will permit a single firm of
legal  counsel,  designated by the Purchasers who hold a majority in interest of
the Registrable Securities being sold pursuant to a Registration  Statement,  to
review  the  Registration   Statement  (other  than  documents  incorporated  by
reference into such  Registration  Statement) and all amendments and supplements
thereto (as well as all requests for  acceleration or  effectiveness  thereof) a
reasonable  period of time prior to their filing with the  Commission,  and will
not file any document in a form to which such counsel reasonably objects, unless
otherwise required by law in the opinion of the Company's counsel.  The sections
of any such  Registration  Statement  including  information with respect to the
Purchasers, the Purchasers' beneficial ownership of securities of the Company or
the Purchasers'  intended  method of disposition of Registrable  Securities must
conform to the information provided to the Company by each of the Purchasers.

         3.8 COMFORT LETTER; LEGAL OPINION. At the request of the Purchasers who
hold a majority in interest of the Registrable Securities being sold pursuant to
a Registration Statement in connection with an underwritten offering, and on the
date that  Registrable  Securities are



                                       6
<PAGE>

delivered  to an  underwriter  for  sale in  connection  with  the  Registration
Statement, the Company will furnish to the underwriters (i) a letter, dated such
date, from the Company's independent  certified public accountants,  in form and
substance as is customarily given by independent certified public accountants to
underwriters in an underwritten public offering,  addressed to the underwriters;
and (ii) an opinion,  dated such date, from counsel representing the Company for
purposes of the Registration  Statement, in form and substance as is customarily
given in an underwritten  public  offering,  addressed to the  underwriters  and
Purchasers.

         3.9  DUE DILIGENCE; CONFIDENTIALITY.

         (a)  The Company will make  available upon  reasonable  advance  notice
during normal business hours for inspection by any Purchaser  whose  Registrable
Securities are being sold pursuant to a Registration Statement,  any underwriter
participating in any disposition pursuant to the Registration Statement, and any
attorney,   accountant  or  other  agent  retained  by  any  such  Purchaser  or
underwriter (collectively,  the "INSPECTORS"), all pertinent financial and other
records,   pertinent   corporate   documents  and   properties  of  the  Company
(collectively,  the "RECORDS"),  as each Inspector reasonably deems necessary to
enable the Inspector to exercise its due diligence  responsibility.  The Company
will cause its officers,  directors and employees to supply all information that
any  Inspector  may  reasonably  request  for  purposes of  performing  such due
diligence.

         (b)  Each  Inspector  will  hold in  confidence,  and will not make any
disclosure  (except to a Purchaser)  of, any Records,  unless (i) the release of
such  Records is ordered  pursuant  to a subpoena or other order from a court or
government body of competent jurisdiction,  (ii) the information in such Records
has been made  generally  available  to the public other than by  disclosure  in
violation of this or any other agreement, (iii) the Records or other information
was developed  independently  by an Inspector  without breach of this Agreement,
(iv)  the  information  was  known  to the  Inspector  before  receipt  of  such
information  from the  Company,  or (v) the  information  was  disclosed  to the
Inspector  by a third  party not under an  obligation  of  confidentiality.  The
Company is not required to disclose any confidential  information in the Records
to  any  Inspector   unless  and  until  such   Inspector  has  entered  into  a
confidentiality  agreement (in form and substance  satisfactory  to the Company)
with the Company with respect thereto, substantially in the form of this Section
3.9. Each Purchaser will,  upon learning that  disclosure of Records  containing
confidential  information  is  sought in or by a court or  governmental  body of
competent jurisdiction or through other means, give prompt notice to the Company
and allow the Company, at the Company's expense, to undertake appropriate action
to prevent  disclosure  of, or to obtain a  protective  order for,  the  Records
deemed  confidential.  Nothing  herein  will be deemed to limit the  Purchaser's
ability to sell Registrable  Securities in a manner that is otherwise consistent
with applicable laws and regulations.

         (c) The  Company  will  hold in  confidence,  and  will  not  make  any
disclosure of, information  concerning a Purchaser provided to the Company under
this Agreement  unless (i) disclosure of such information is necessary to comply
with federal or state  securities  laws, (ii) the disclosure of such information
is necessary to avoid or correct a misstatement or omission in any  Registration
Statement,  (iii) the  release  of such  information  is ordered  pursuant  to a
subpoena  or  other  order  from a  court  or  governmental  body  of  competent
jurisdiction,  (iv) such


                                       7
<PAGE>

information  has been made  generally  available  to the  public  other  than by
disclosure  in  violation  of this  Agreement  or any other  agreement,  (v) the
information  was  disclosed  to the  Company  by a  third  party  not  under  an
obligation  of  confidentiality,  (vi) such  Purchaser  consents to the form and
content  of  any  such   disclosure,   (vii)  the   information   was  developed
independently  by the Company  without  breach of this  Agreement  or (viii) the
information was known to the Company before receipt of such information from the
Inspector.  If the Company learns that disclosure of such information concerning
a  Purchaser  is  sought  in or by a court  or  governmental  body of  competent
jurisdiction or through other means, the Company will give prompt notice to such
Purchaser  prior to making  such  disclosure  and allow such  Purchaser,  at its
expense, to undertake  appropriate action to prevent disclosure of, or to obtain
a protective order for, such information.

         3.10  LISTING.  The  Company  will  (i)  cause  all of the  Registrable
Securities covered by each Registration  Statement to be listed on each national
securities  exchange on which  securities  of the same class or series issued by
the  Company  are  then  listed,  if any,  if the  listing  of such  Registrable
Securities is then permitted  under the rules of such  exchange,  or (ii) to the
extent  the  securities  of the same  class or series  are not then  listed on a
national securities exchange, secure the designation and quotation of all of the
Registrable Securities covered by each Registration Statement on Nasdaq National
Market ("NASDAQ"),  and, in each case, maintain such listing or quotation for so
long  as  any   Purchaser   beneficially   owns  any   Registrable   Securities.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) in the case of any consolidation or merger of
the Company with or into any other  corporation,  Person, or any other corporate
reorganization,  in which the Company  shall not be the  continuing or surviving
entity of such  consolidation,  merger or reorganization,  or any sale of all or
substantially  all of the  assets of the  Company  (any such  transaction  being
hereinafter  referred to as a  "REORGANIZATION"),  in which,  in each case,  the
consideration  to be paid to all of the  Purchasers  upon  the  consummation  or
effective date of such Reorganization (the "EFFECTIVE DATE") is all cash for all
of the  securities of the Company  beneficially  owned by all of the  Purchasers
then, in each case, upon the Effective Date the  obligations  under this Section
3.10  shall  terminate,  (b) in the  case of any  Reorganization  in  which  the
consideration  to be paid to all of the  Purchasers  upon the Effective  Date is
securities  of a Person other than the Company for all of the  securities of the
Company  beneficially  owned by all of such  Purchasers and such  securities are
listed on a national securities exchange or NASDAQ, then upon the Effective Date
the obligations  under this Section 3.10 shall NOT terminate;  PROVIDED that the
obligations  under this  Section  3.10 to list or include for  quotation  and to
maintain such listing or inclusion for quotation,  as applicable,  securities of
the Company shall  terminate if all of such Purchasers do not  beneficially  own
any securities of the Company as a result of such  Reorganization  or (c) in the
case of any proposed Reorganization in which the consideration to be paid to all
of the  Purchasers  upon the Effective Date is securities of a Person for all of
the securities of the Company  beneficially  owned by all of such Purchasers and
such securities are NOT listed on a national securities exchange or NASDAQ, then
the  Company  shall  obtain  the PRIOR  written  consent of the  Purchasers  who
beneficially own a majority-in-interest of Registrable Securities (determined on
an as-exercised basis) prior to effecting such Reorganization.

         3.11  TRANSFER  AGENT;  REGISTRAR.  The Company will provide a transfer
agent  and  registrar,  which  may  be a  single  entity,  for  the  Registrable
Securities not later than the effective date of the Registration Statement.


                                       8
<PAGE>

         3.12 SHARE CERTIFICATES. The Company will cooperate with the Purchasers
who hold Registrable Securities being sold and with the managing underwriter(s),
if any, to facilitate the timely  preparation and delivery of certificates  (not
bearing any  restrictive  legends)  representing  Registrable  Securities  to be
offered pursuant to a Registration  Statement and will enable such  certificates
to be in such  denominations  or amounts as the case may be, and  registered  in
such  names  as the  Purchasers  or the  managing  underwriter(s),  if any,  may
reasonably  request,  all in  accordance  with Article V of each of the Purchase
Agreements.

         3.13 PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION.  At the request of the Purchasers  holding a
majority in  interest of the  Registrable  Securities  registered  pursuant to a
Registration  Statement,  the Company  will  promptly  prepare and file with the
Commission such amendments (including post-effective amendments) and supplements
to the  Registration  Statement,  and the prospectus used in connection with the
Registration  Statement,  as may be  necessary  in order to  change  the plan of
distribution set forth in such Registration Statement.

         3.14  SECURITIES  LAWS  COMPLIANCE.  The  Company  will comply with all
applicable laws related to any  Registration  Statement  relating to the sale of
Registrable  Securities  and to  offering  and sale of  securities  and with all
applicable  rules and  regulations  of  governmental  authorities  in connection
therewith (including,  without limitation,  the Securities Act, the Exchange Act
and the rules and regulations promulgated by the Commission).

         3.15 FURTHER  ASSURANCES.  The Company  will take all other  reasonable
actions as any Purchaser or the underwriters,  if any, may reasonably request to
expedite  and  facilitate  disposition  by  such  Purchaser  of the  Registrable
Securities pursuant to the Registration Statement.


                                   ARTICLE IV

                          OBLIGATIONS OF THE PURCHASERS

         4.1  PURCHASER INFORMATION.  As a condition to the  obligations  of the
Company to complete any registration  pursuant to this Agreement with respect to
the Registrable Securities of each Purchaser, such Purchaser will furnish to the
Company such information regarding itself, the Registrable Securities held by it
and the intended method of disposition of the Registrable  Securities held by it
as is  reasonably  required  by the  Company to effect the  registration  of the
Registrable  Securities.  At least  ten (10)  business  days  prior to the first
anticipated  filing date of a Registration  Statement for any registration under
this  Agreement,  the Company will notify each Purchaser of the  information the
Company  requires from that Purchaser if the Purchaser elects to have any of its
Registrable Securities included in the Registration Statement.  If, within three
(3)  business  days prior to the filing  date,  the Company has not received the
requested  information  from  a  Purchaser,   then  the  Company  may  file  the
Registration   Statement  without  including  Registrable   Securities  of  that
Purchaser.

         4.2 FURTHER ASSURANCES. Each Purchaser will cooperate with the Company,
as reasonably  requested by the Company,  in connection with the preparation and
filing of any  Registration  Statement  hereunder,  unless  such  Purchaser  has
notified the Company in writing of



                                       9
<PAGE>

such Purchaser's election (with respect to such registration  statement only) to
exclude all of such  Purchaser's  Registrable  Securities from the  Registration
Statement.

         4.3  SUSPENSION OF SALES.   Upon receipt of any notice from the Company
under Section 3.6, each Purchaser will  immediately  discontinue  disposition of
Registrable  Securities  pursuant to the  Registration  Statement  covering such
Registrable Securities until (i) it receives copies of a supplemented or amended
prospectus  contemplated  by  Section  3.6(a) or (ii) the  Company  advises  the
Purchaser that a suspension of sales under Section 3.6(b) has terminated.  If so
directed by the  Company,  each  Purchaser  will  deliver to the Company (at the
expense of the Company) or destroy (and deliver to the Company a certificate  of
destruction)  all copies in the  Purchaser's  possession  (other  than a limited
number of file copies) of the prospectus  covering such  Registrable  Securities
that is current at the time of receipt of such notice.

         4.4  UNDERWRITTEN OFFERINGS.

         (a)  If Purchasers  holding a majority in  interest of the  Registrable
Securities  being  registered  (with the  approval  of the  Initial  Purchasers)
determine to engage the services of an  underwriter,  each  Purchaser will enter
into and perform such Purchaser's  obligations under an underwriting  agreement,
in  usual  and  customary  form,   including,   without  limitation,   customary
indemnification and contribution  obligations,  with the managing underwriter of
such offering,  and will take such other actions as are  reasonably  required in
order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of the  Registrable  Securities,
unless such  Purchaser  has notified the Company in writing of such  Purchaser's
election to exclude all of its  Registrable  Securities  from such  Registration
Statement.

         (b)  Without limiting any Purchaser's  rights under Section 2.1 hereof,
no Purchaser may participate in any underwritten  distribution  hereunder unless
such Purchaser (a) agrees to sell such Purchaser's Registrable Securities on the
basis  provided in any  underwriting  arrangements  approved  by the  Purchasers
entitled hereunder to approve such arrangements,  (b) completes and executes all
questionnaires,  powers of attorney,  indemnities,  underwriting  agreements and
other  documents  reasonably  required  under  the  terms  of such  underwriting
arrangements,  and (c)  agrees  to pay its pro rata  share  of all  underwriting
discounts and commissions and other fees and expenses of investment  bankers and
any  manager  or  managers  of such  underwriting,  and  legal  expenses  of the
underwriter, applicable with respect to its Registrable Securities, in each case
to the extent not payable by the Company under the terms of this Agreement.


                                   ARTICLE V

                            EXPENSES OF REGISTRATION

         The Company will bear all reasonable expenses,  other than underwriting
discounts and  commissions,  and transfer taxes, if any,  incurred in connection
with registrations,  filings or qualifications  pursuant to Articles II, III and
Section 4.4 of this Agreement,  including, without limitation, all registration,
listing and  qualifications  fees,  printers and  accounting  fees, the fees and
disbursements  of  counsel  for  the  Company,   and  the  reasonable  fees  and
disbursements  of



                                       10
<PAGE>

one firm of legal counsel selected by the Initial Purchasers pursuant to Section
3.7 hereof not to exceed $20,000.


                                   ARTICLE VI

                                 INDEMNIFICATION

         In  the  event  that  any  Registrable  Securities  are  included  in a
Registration Statement under this Agreement:

         6.1   The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Purchaser  that
holds such Registrable Securities, any underwriter (as defined in the Securities
Act) for the  Purchasers,  any  directors or officers of such  Purchaser or such
underwriter  and any Person who  controls  such  Purchaser  or such  underwriter
within  the  meaning  of the  Securities  Act  or the  Exchange  Act  (each,  an
"INDEMNIFIED  PERSON")  against  any  losses,  claims,   damages,   expenses  or
liabilities  (joint  or  several)  (collectively,  and  together  with  actions,
proceedings  or inquiries by any  regulatory  or  self-regulatory  organization,
whether  commenced or threatened in respect  thereof,  "CLAIMS") to which any of
them become  subject  under the  Securities  Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise,
insofar  as such  Claims  arise  out of or are based  upon any of the  following
statements,  omissions or violations in a Registration  Statement filed pursuant
to this  Agreement,  any  post-effective  amendment  thereof  or any  prospectus
included  therein:  (a) any untrue  statement or alleged  untrue  statement of a
material  fact  contained in the  Registration  Statement or any  post-effective
amendment  thereof  or the  omission  or  alleged  omission  to state  therein a
material fact required to be stated  therein or necessary to make the statements
therein not misleading,  (b) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of
a  material  fact  contained  in  the  prospectus  (as  it  may  be  amended  or
supplemented)  or the omission or alleged omission to state therein any material
fact  necessary  to  make  the  statements   made  therein,   in  light  of  the
circumstances  under which the statements therein were made, not misleading,  or
(c) any violation or alleged violation by the Company of the Securities Act, the
Exchange Act or any other law, including without limitation any state securities
law or any rule or regulation  thereunder (the matters in the foregoing  clauses
(a) through (c) being, collectively,  "VIOLATIONS"). Subject to the restrictions
set forth in  Section  6.3 with  respect  to the  number of legal  counsel,  the
Company will reimburse the  Purchasers and each such  underwriter or controlling
Person and each such other Indemnified Person.  Notwithstanding  anything to the
contrary  contained  herein,  the  indemnification  agreement  contained in this
Section  6.1:  (i) does  not  apply to a Claim  arising  out of or based  upon a
Violation  that  occurs in  reliance  upon and in  conformity  with  information
furnished in writing to the Company by any Indemnified  Person expressly for use
in connection  with the  preparation of the  Registration  Statement or any such
amendment  thereof or supplement  thereto;  (ii) does not apply to Claim arising
out of or  based  on  any  failure  by an  Indemnified  Person  to  comply  with
prospectus delivery requirements (or the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or any
other law or legal requirement  applicable to them) or any covenant or agreement
contained in the Purchase Agreements or this Agreement; and (iii) does not apply
to amounts paid in  settlement  of any Claim if such  settlement is made without
the prior written consent of the Company, which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed.  This  indemnity  obligation  will remain in full force and
effect regardless of any  investigation  made by or on behalf of the Indemnified


                                       11
<PAGE>

Persons and will  survive  the  transfer of the  Registrable  Securities  by the
Purchasers under Article IX of this Agreement.

         6.2  In connection with any Registration Statement in which a Purchaser
is participating, each such Purchaser, severally and not jointly, will indemnify
and hold  harmless,  to the same  extent  and in the same  manner  set  forth in
Section 6.1 above, the Company, each of its directors,  each of its officers who
signs the Registration Statement,  each Person, if any, who controls the Company
within the meaning of the  Securities  Act or the  Exchange  Act,  and any other
shareholder selling securities pursuant to the Registration  Statement or any of
its directors or officers or any Person who controls such shareholder within the
meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act (each an "INDEMNIFIED PERSON")
against any Claim to which any of them may become  subject under the  Securities
Act, the Exchange  Act or  otherwise,  insofar as such Claim arises out of or is
based upon any of the  following:  (a) any matter of the type referred to clause
(a) or (b) in  Section  6.1  above in each case to the  extent  (and only to the
extent)  that such  violation  occurs in reliance  upon and in  conformity  with
written information furnished to the Company by such Purchaser expressly for use
in  connection  with such  Registration  Statement  or (b) any  failure  by such
Purchaser to comply with  prospectus  delivery  requirements  (or the Securities
Act, the Exchange Act or any other law or legal requirement  applicable to sales
under the  Registration  Statement).  Subject to the  restrictions  set forth in
Section  6.3,  such  Purchaser  will  reimburse  any  legal  or  other  expenses
reasonably  incurred by them in connection with  investigating  or defending any
such Claim.  However, the indemnity agreement contained in this Section 6.2 does
not apply to  amounts  paid in  settlement  of any Claim if such  settlement  is
effected without the prior written consent of such Purchaser, which consent will
not be unreasonably  withheld or delayed,  and no Purchaser will be liable under
this  Agreement  (including  this Section 6.2 and Article VII) for the amount of
any Claim that exceeds the net proceeds actually received by such Purchaser as a
result  of the sale of  Registrable  Securities  pursuant  to such  Registration
Statement. This indemnity will remain in full force and effect regardless of any
investigation  made by or on behalf of an Indemnified Party and will survive the
transfer of the  Registrable  Securities by the  Purchasers  under Article IX of
this Agreement.

         6.3  Promptly after receipt by an Indemnified Person under this Article
VI of notice of the  commencement  of any  action  (including  any  governmental
action),  such  Indemnified  Person will, if a Claim in respect thereof is to be
made  against  any  indemnifying  party under this  Article  VI,  deliver to the
indemnifying   party  a  written  notice  of  the  commencement   thereof.   The
indemnifying party may participate in, and, to the extent the indemnifying party
so desires,  jointly with any other  indemnifying  party similarly given notice,
assume control of the defense thereof with counsel mutually  satisfactory to the
indemnifying  parties and the Indemnified Person. In that case, the indemnifying
party will  diligently  pursue such defense.  If, in the  reasonable  opinion of
counsel retained by the indemnifying  party, the  representation by such counsel
of the Indemnified  Person and the indemnifying party would be inappropriate due
to actual or potential  conflicts of interest between the Indemnified Person and
any other party  represented by such counsel in such proceeding or the actual or
potential   defendants  in,  or  targets  of,  any  such  action  including  the
Indemnified Person and such Indemnified Person reasonably  determines that there
may be legal defenses  available to such  Indemnified  Person that are different
from or in addition  to those  available  to the  indemnifying  party,  then the
Indemnified  Person is entitled  to assume  such  defense and may retain its own
counsel,  with  the  fees  and  expenses  to be paid by the  indemnifying  party
(subject to the restrictions on settlement under



                                       12
<PAGE>

Section  6.1 or 6.2,  as  applicable).  The  Company  will  pay for only one (1)
separate legal counsel for the Purchasers  collectively,  and such legal counsel
will be  selected  by the  Purchasers  holding a  majority  in  interest  of the
Registrable   Securities.   The  failure  to  deliver   written  notice  to  the
indemnifying  party within a  reasonable  time of the  commencement  of any such
action does not relieve an indemnifying party of any liability to an Indemnified
Person under this Article VI, except to the extent that the  indemnifying  party
is prejudiced in its ability to defend such action.


                                   ARTICLE VII

                                  CONTRIBUTION

         To  the  extent  that  any  indemnification   provided  for  herein  is
prohibited  or  limited by law,  the  indemnifying  party will make the  maximum
contribution  with respect to any amounts for which it would otherwise be liable
under  Article  VI to the  fullest  extent  permitted  by law.  However,  (a) no
contribution  will be made under  circumstances  where the maker  would not have
been liable for  indemnification  under the fault standards set forth in Article
VI,   (b)  no   seller  of   Registrable   Securities   guilty   of   fraudulent
misrepresentation  (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the  Securities  Act)
will be entitled to contribution  from any seller of Registrable  Securities who
was  not  guilty  of such  fraudulent  misrepresentation,  and (c)  contribution
(together with any indemnification or other obligations under this Agreement) by
any seller of Registrable Securities will be limited in amount to the net amount
of  proceeds  received  by  such  seller  from  the  sale  of  such  Registrable
Securities.


                                  ARTICLE VIII

                             EXCHANGE ACT REPORTING

         In order to make  available to the Purchasers the benefits of Rule 144,
the Company will:

         (a)   File with the Commission  in a timely  manner,  and make and keep
available,  all reports and other  documents  required of the Company  under the
Securities  Act and the Exchange Act so long as the Company  remains  subject to
such  requirements  and the filing and  availability  of such  reports and other
documents is required for the applicable provisions of Rule 144; and

         (b)   Furnish to  each  Purchaser,  so long  as  such  Purchaser  holds
Registrable  Securities,  promptly upon the Purchaser's  request,  (i) a written
statement by the Company that it has complied with the reporting requirements of
the  Securities  Act and the Exchange Act, (ii) a copy of the most recent annual
or quarterly report of the Company and such other reports and documents filed by
the  Company  with the  Commission  and (iii) such other  information  as may be
reasonably  requested to permit the Purchasers to sell such securities  pursuant
to Rule 144 without registration.

                        ASSIGNMENT OF REGISTRATION RIGHTS

         The rights of the Purchasers hereunder, including the right to have the
Company  register  Registrable  Securities  pursuant to this Agreement,  will be
assigned automatically by the Purchasers to Permitted Transferees of Registrable
Securities,  but only if (a) the Purchaser  agrees in writing with the Permitted
Transferee to assign such rights,  and a copy of such  agreement is furnished to
the Company within a reasonable time after such assignment,  (b) the Company is,
within a  reasonable  time after such  transfer or  assignment,  furnished  with
written  notice of the name and  address of such  Permitted  Transferee  and the
securities with respect to which such registration  rights are being transferred
or assigned, (c) such transfer or assignment was not made under the Registration
Statement  or Rule  144,  (d) at or before  the time the  Company  received  the
written  notice  contemplated  by clause  (b) of this  sentence,  the  Permitted
Transferee  agrees  in  writing  with  the  Company  to be  bound  by all of the
provisions  contained  herein,  (e) such transfer is made in accordance with the
applicable  requirements  of the  Purchase  Agreements,  if  any,  and  (f)  the
Permitted Transferee is an "accredited investor" as that term is defined in Rule
501 of  Regulation D or the  transfer to such  Permitted  Transferee  is made in
compliance with state and federal securities laws. Any Permitted Transferee of a
Purchaser  under  Article IX shall be deemed a  "Purchaser"  for all purposes of
this  Agreement,  and shall be  entitled  to all rights  of, and  subject to all
obligations (including indemnification obligations) of, a Purchaser hereunder.

         This  Agreement  may be amended and the  obligations  hereunder  may be
waived (either generally or in a particular  instance,  and either retroactively
or  prospectively)  only with the  written  consent  of the  Company  and of the
Purchasers  who then hold a majority in interest of the  Registrable  Securities
(but not  including  any  Purchaser  who is not  affected by such  amendment  or
waiver).  Any amendment or waiver  effected in accordance with this Article X is
binding upon each Purchaser and the Company.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,  no
amendment or waiver will retroactively affect any Purchaser without its consent,
or will  prospectively  adversely  affect any  Purchaser  who no longer owns any
Registrable  Securities without its consent.  Neither Article VI nor Article VII
hereof may be amended or waived in a manner  adverse to a Purchaser  without its
consent.


                                   ARTICLE XI

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

         11.1  CONFLICTING  INSTRUCTIONS.  A Person  is deemed to be a holder of
Registrable  Securities  whenever  such Person  owns of record such  Registrable
Securities.  If  the  Company  receives  conflicting  instructions,  notices  or
elections  from two (2) or more  Persons  with  respect to the same  Registrable
Securities,  the  Company  will act upon the  basis of  instructions,  notice or
election received from the registered owner of such Registrable Securities.

         11.2  NOTICES.  Any notices required or permitted to be given under the
terms of this Agreement will be given as set forth in the Purchase Agreements.

         11.3  NO WAIVER; CUMULATIVE REMEDIES.  No failure or delay on  the part
of any  party to this  Agreement  in  exercising  any  right,  power  or  remedy
hereunder  shall  operate as a waiver  thereof;  nor shall any single or partial
exercise  of any such  right,  power or remedy  preclude  any  other or  further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right,  power or remedy hereunder.
The remedies  herein  provided are  cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies
provided by law.

         11.4  GOVERNING LAW. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED
IN  ACCORDANCE  WITH,  THE INTERNAL  LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK,  AND WITHOUT
GIVING EFFECT TO CHOICE OF LAW PROVISIONS WHICH MIGHT REQUIRE THE APPLICATION OF
THE LAWS OF ANOTHER JURISDICTION.

         11.5  SEVERABILITY. The provisions of this Agreement are severable and,
in the event that any court of competent  jurisdiction  shall determine that any
one or more of the provisions or part of a provision contained in this Agreement
shall,  for any reason,  be held to be invalid,  illegal or unenforceable in any
respect,  such invalidity,  illegality or unenforceability  shall not affect any
other provision or part of a provision of this Agreement;  but the terms of this
Agreement  shall be  reformed  and  construed  as if such  invalid or illegal or
unenforceable  provision,  or part of a  provision,  had  never  been  contained
herein,  and such  provisions or part reformed so that it would be valid,  legal
and enforceable to the maximum extent possible.

         11.6   ENTIRE AGREEMENT.  This Agreement  and the  Purchase  Agreements
(including all schedules and exhibits thereto)  executed and delivered  herewith
constitute  the entire  agreement  among the parties  hereto with respect to the
subject  matter  hereof  and  thereof.  There  are  no  restrictions,  promises,
warranties or undertakings,  other than those set forth or referred to herein or
therein. This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings among
the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof.

         11.7  SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS. Subject to the requirements of Article IX
hereof,  this  Agreement  shall be binding  upon and inure to the benefit of the
successors and assigns of each of the parties hereto.  Notwithstanding  anything
to the contrary herein, including, without limitation, Article IX, the rights of
a Purchaser  hereunder are assignable to and  exercisable by a bona fide pledgee
of the  Registrable  Securities  in  connection  with a  Purchaser's  margin  or
brokerage accounts.

         11.8  USE OF PRONOUNS. All pronouns refer to the masculine, feminine or
neuter, singular or plural, as the context may require.

         11.9  HEADINGS.  Article,  section  and  subsection  headings  in  this
Agreement are included  herein for  convenience  of reference only and shall not
constitute a part of this Agreement for any other purpose.

         11.10  COUNTERPARTS.  This  Agreement  may be executed in any number of
counterparts,  all of which taken  together  shall  constitute  one and the same
instrument,  and any of the parties


                                       15

hereto  may  execute  this  Agreement  by  signing  any such  counterpart.  This
Agreement,  once executed by a party, may be delivered to the other party hereto
by facsimile  transmission,  and facsimile signatures are binding on the parties
hereto.

         11.11  FURTHER ASSURANCES.  Each party hereto shall execute and deliver
such instruments, documents and other writings as may be reasonably necessary or
desirable  to  confirm  and carry out and to  effectuate  fully the  intent  and
purposes of this Agreement.

         11.12  CONSENTS.  All consents and other determinations to be  made  by
the Purchasers pursuant to this Agreement will be made by the Initial Purchasers
or the Purchasers holding a majority in interest of the Registrable Securities.

         11.13  NO STRICT CONSTRUCTION.  The language used in this  Agreement is
deemed to be the language  chosen by the parties to express their mutual intent,
and no rules of strict construction will be applied against any party.

         11.14  STANDOFF AGREEMENT.  In connection with the underwritten  public
offering of any of the Company's equity  securities,  each Initial Purchaser (so
long as they beneficially own at least five percent (5%) of the capital stock of
the  Company)  agrees,  that  upon  request  of the  underwriters  managing  any
underwritten offering of the Company's equity securities,  not to sell, make any
short sale of, loan, grant any option for the purchase of, or otherwise  dispose
of any  Registrable  Securities  without  the  prior  written  consent  of  such
underwriters for such period of time (not to exceed 120 days) from the effective
date of such  registration  statement as may be  requested by the  underwriters;
provided  that the (i)  executive  officers and directors of the Company who own
equity  securities  of the Company and (ii) holders of five percent (5%) or more
of the capital stock of the Company also agree to such restrictions.
