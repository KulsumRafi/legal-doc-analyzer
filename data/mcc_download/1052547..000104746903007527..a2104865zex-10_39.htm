<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THIS SECOND AMENDMENT TO LEASE (the "Second Amendment") is entered into this 17&nbsp;day of December, 2002, between EXECUTIVE TERRACE INVESTORS, L.P.
("Landlord"), and VERSICOR&nbsp;INC., a Delaware corporation ("Tenant"). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE
PARTIES ENTER THIS AGREEMENT on the basis of the following, facts, understandings and intentions: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Landlord,
as successor to Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association and Tenant are parties to a certain Lease (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>Original Lease</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>")
dated May&nbsp;2, 2001, as amended by the First Amendment to Lease dated October&nbsp;7, 2002 (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>First Amendment</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>" and together with the Original
Lease, the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>Lease</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"), covering premises (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>Existing Space</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") located on the third (3<SUP>rd</SUP>)
floor and second (2<SUP>nd</SUP>) floor of the building located at 455 South Gulph Road, King of Prussia, Pennsylvania (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>Building</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"), as more
particularly described in the Lease. Landlord and Tenant desire for Tenant to lease additional space located on the third (3rd) floor of the Building, subject to and in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the Lease and this Second Amendment. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW
THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and of the mutual promises contained in this Second Amendment, and for other good and valuable consideration the receipt and sufficiency
of which is acknowledged by Landlord and Tenant, and intending to be legally bound hereby, Landlord and Tenant agree as follows: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Landlord
hereby leases to Tenant and Tenant hereby rents from Landlord, in addition to the Existing Space, the portion of the Building consisting of an area containing
approximately ten thousand-eight hundred-eighty-six (10,886) square feet of rentable floor area, located on the third (3<SUP>rd</SUP>) floor of the Building and designated as "Third
Floor Expansion Space" on </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Exhibit&nbsp;A </I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>attached hereto and made a part hereof (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>Third Floor Expansion
Space</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"), subject to and in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Second Amendment. A certificate from Landlord's architect confirming the square feet of rentable
floor area in the Third Floor Expansion Space is attached to this Second Amendment as </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Exhibit&nbsp;A-1</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>. Capitalized terms used but not
defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Lease. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Landlord
shall perform the tenant improvements (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>Third Floor Expansion Space Work</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") more particularly described in the
work letter agreement (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>Third Floor Expansion Space Work Letter Agreement</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") attached hereto as Exhibit&nbsp;B. The Third Floor Expansion Space
Work shall be ready for occupancy ("</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>Ready for Occupancy</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") when (i)&nbsp;the Third Floor Expansion Space Work has been completed or substantially
completed by Landlord and (ii)&nbsp;the Third Floor Expansion Space, with the Third Floor Expansion Space Work so completed or substantially completed, has been delivered, tendered or made available
to Tenant pursuant to a written notice to Tenant that the Third Floor Expansion Space is Ready for Occupancy. The term "substantially completed" as used in this Second Amendment shall mean the date of
issuance of a certificate of occupancy (temporary or permanent) for the Third Floor Expansion Space by the municipality in which the Building is located, or if no certificate of occupancy is required,
the date of substantial completion of the Third Floor Expansion Space Work in accordance with the Third Floor Expansion Space Work Letter and as certified by each Landlord's and Tenant's respective
architect, which certification shall be conclusive and binding upon Landlord and Tenant. The Third Floor Expansion Space Work shall be deemed substantially completed notwithstanding the fact that
minor details of construction, mechanical adjustments or decorations which do not materially interfere with Tenant's use and enjoyment and lawful occupancy of the Third Floor Expansion Space (items
normally referred to as "punch list" items) remain to be performed. By taking possession and occupancy of the Third Floor Expansion Space, Tenant accepts the Third Floor Expansion Space and the Third
Floor Expansion Space Work as completed or substantially completed, </FONT></P>

subject to Landlord's obligations to complete the Third Floor Expansion Space Work in compliance with the Third Floor Expansion Space Work Letter and subject to any warranties from Landlord's vendors
except that in the latter case, on or about the date of Tenant's taking possession of the Third Floor Expansion Space, Landlord and Tenant shall jointly prepare a list of incomplete and/or corrective
items needed at the Third Floor Expansion Space (the "Corrective Work") (which shall not include any items requiring repair or correction due to </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>damage  </I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>caused in connection with Tenant's taking
possession of the Third Floor Expansion Space or due to the negligence or willful misconduct of Tenant, its agents, employees or
contractors. If properly includable as part of the Third Floor Expansion Space Work, Landlord shall diligently complete, as soon as reasonably possible (but in no event later than thirty
(30)&nbsp;days after the list of Corrective Work is prepared), any items of work and adjustment on such list as are not completed when the Third Floor Expansion Space is Ready for Occupancy,
Landlord will give Tenant reasonable advance written notice of the date on which Landlord expects the Third Floor Expansion Space to be Ready for Occupancy. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding
the foregoing, in the event the Third Floor Expansion Space Work is not Ready for Occupancy on or before January&nbsp;15, 2003, then Landlord shall provide to Tenant
temporary space consisting of not less than five (5)&nbsp;offices with working utilities and telephones within the currently available space within the Building as determined jointly and reasonably
by Landlord and Tenant, at no cost to Tenant, until such time as the Third Floor Expansion Premises are Ready for Occupancy. Tenant's occupancy of such temporary space shall be subject to all the
terms and conditions of the Lease and this Second Amendment except Tenant shall not be obligated to pay base rent or additional rent on the temporary space. Landlord agrees, at its sole cost and
expense, to run cable necessary to connect the Tenant's computer system network and telephones in the temporary space with the computer system network and telephone system located in the Existing
Space. </FONT></P>

Expansion Space is Ready for Occupancy (or, if the date on which the Third Floor Expansion Space is Ready for Occupancy is delayed and such, delay is caused solely by Tenant's delays (beyond five
(5)&nbsp;business days, after Tenant's receipt thereof) in reviewing or approving plans and specifications, Tenant's requests for materials, finishes or installations other than as otherwise
contemplated by the plans and specifications, Tenant's changes in plans and specifications, or other acts, omissions or delays of Tenant, the Third Floor Expansion Space Commencement Date shall be the
date on which the Third Floor Expansion Space would have been Ready for Occupancy less the total number of days of delay attributable solely to such causes, as reasonably determined in good faith by
Landlord and promptly set forth in writing to Tenant; or (b)&nbsp;the date upon which Tenant takes possession or beneficial occupancy of the Third Floor Expansion Space with Landlord's written
consent. </FONT></P>
