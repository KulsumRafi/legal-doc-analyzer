<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Board of Directors of the Company (the &#147;Board&#148;) has determined that it is in the
best interests of the Company and its shareholders to ensure that the Company will have
the continued dedication of the Executive, notwithstanding the possibility, threat or
occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined in Section&nbsp;2) of the Company. The Board
believes that it is imperative to diminish the inevitable distraction of the Executive by
virtue of the personal uncertainties and risks created by a pending or threatened Change
of Control and to encourage the Executive&#146;s full attention and dedication to the
Company currently and in the event of any threatened or pending Change of Control, and to
provide the Executive with compensation and benefits arrangements upon a Change of Control
which ensure that the compensation and benefits expectations of the Executive will be
satisfied, which are competitive with those of other corporations and which align the
Executive&#146;s interests with those of the Company&#146;s shareholders. Therefore, in
order to accomplish these objectives, the Board has caused the Company to enter into this
Agreement. </FONT></P>

               annual base salary (&#147;Annual Base Salary&#148;), which shall be paid in
               equal installments on a monthly basis, at least equal to 12&nbsp;times the
               highest monthly base salary paid or payable to the Executive by the Company and
               its Affiliated Companies in respect of the 12-month period immediately preceding
               the month in which the Effective Date occurs. For purposes of this Agreement,
               Annual Base Salary shall not include any payments by the Company on the
               Executive&#146;s behalf pursuant to any incentive, savings or retirement plans,
               any welfare benefit plans or any fringe benefit plans, in each case, of the
               Company or any Affiliated Companies, of the type identified in
               paragraphs&nbsp;(iii) through (vii) of this Section 4(b), or any reimbursement
               of expenses by the Company or any Affiliated Companies in accordance with
               paragraph&nbsp;(v) of this Section 4(b); provided, however, that Annual Base
               Salary shall include any contributions that the Executive elects to contribute
               or defer to any savings, retirement, deferred compensation or other similar
               plan. During the Employment Period, the Annual Base Salary shall be reviewed at
               least annually and shall be increased at any time and from time to time as shall
               be substantially consistent with increases in base salary generally awarded in
               the ordinary course of business to other peer executives of the Company and its
               Affiliated Companies. Any increase in Annual Base Salary shall not serve to
               limit or reduce any other obligation to the Executive under this Agreement.
               Annual Base Salary shall not be reduced after any such increase, and the term
               Annual Base Salary as utilized in this Agreement shall refer to Annual Base
               Salary as so increased. </FONT></P></TD>

          Employee to substantially perform his duties with the Company (other than any
          such failure resulting from incapacity due to physical or mental illness), for a
          period of 30 days after written notice of demand for substantial performance has
          been delivered to Employee by the Board of Directors which specifically
          identifies the manner in which the Board believes that Employee has not
          substantially performed his duties, or (ii)&nbsp;the willful engaging by
          Employee in gross misconduct materially and demonstrably injurious to the
          Company, as determined by the Board of Directors after notice to Employee and an
          opportunity for a hearing. No act, nor failure to act, on Employee&#146;s part
          shall be considered &#147;willful&#148; unless he has acted or failed to act
          with an absence of good faith and without a reasonable belief that his action or

          Determination of Amount. An initial determination as to whether the Excise Tax
          will be imposed, the amount of the Excise Tax and the calculated Tax Gross-up
          shall be made, at the Company&#146;s expense, by the accounting firm that is the
          Company&#146;s independent accounting firm as of the date of the Change in

          determination (the &#147;Determination&#148;), together with detailed supporting
          calculations and documentation, to the Company and the Executive within ten (10)
          days of the date on which the Payments are triggered, or such other time as
          requested by the Company or by the Executive (provided the Executive reasonably
          believes that any of the Payments may be subject to the Excise Tax) and, if the
          Accounting Firm determines that no Excise Tax is payable by the Executive with
          respect to a Payment or Payments, it shall furnish the Executive with an opinion
          reasonably acceptable to the Executive that no Excise Tax will be imposed with
          respect to any such Payment or Payments. Within ten (10) days of the delivery of
          the Determination to the Executive, the Executive shall have the right to
          dispute the Determination (the &#147;Dispute&#148;). If there is no Dispute, the
          Determination shall be binding, final and conclusive upon the Company and the

          Overpayments and Underpayments. As a result of uncertainty in the application of
          Section 4999 of the Code at the time of the initial determination by the
          Accounting Firm hereunder, it is possible that Tax Gross-Up payments not made by
          the Company should have been made
          (&#147;Underpayment<B><I>&#148;</I></B><I></I>), or that Tax Gross-Up payments
          will have been made by the Company which should not have been made
          (&#147;Overpayments&#148;). In either such event, the Accounting Firm shall
          determine the amount of the Underpayment or Overpayment that has occurred. In
          the case of an Underpayment, the Company shall promptly pay the amount of such
          Underpayment <U>to</U> or for the benefit of the Executive. In the case of an
          Overpayment, the Executive shall, at the direction and expense of the Company,
          take such steps as are reasonably necessary (including the filing of returns and
          claims for refund), follow reasonable instructions from, and procedures
          established by, the Company, and otherwise reasonably cooperate with the Company
          to correct such Overpayment. </FONT></P>
