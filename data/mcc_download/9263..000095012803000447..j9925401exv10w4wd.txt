shall instead be references to "Citizens".

      3. Section 1.01 of the Loan Agreement is hereby amended by deleting the
existing definition of "Loan" or "Loans" and inserting the following in its
stead:


<PAGE>

      "Loan" or "Loans" shall mean, singularly or collectively, as the context
      may require, the Revolving Credit Loans, the Swing Line Loans and any
      other credit to any Borrower extended by any Bank in accordance with
      Article II hereof as evidenced by the Notes, as the case may be.

      refundings in whole or in part.

      5. Section 1.01 of the Loan Agreement is hereby amended by deleting the
existing definition of "Office" and inserting the following in its stead:

      "Office", when used in connection with (i) Citizens or the Agent, shall
      mean its designated office located at 525 William Penn Place, Pittsburgh,
      Pennsylvania 15219 or such other office of Citizens or the Agent as
      Citizens or the Agent may designate in writing from time to time, or (ii)
      any other Bank, shall mean its designated office identified on Schedule 1
      attached hereto and made a part hereof with respect to such Bank or such
      other office of such Bank as such Bank may designate in writing from time

      for the month ending on the date of determination.

      "Libor Advantage Loan Interest Payment Date" shall mean, initially, April
      1, 2003, and thereafter the numerically corresponding date of each month.
      If a month does not contain a day that numerically corresponds to the date

      Loan Interest Payment Date shall be the last day of such month.

      "Libor Advantage Loan Interest Period" shall mean, initially, the period
      commencing on March 24, 2003 (the "Start Date") and ending on the
      numerically corresponding date one (1) month later, and thereafter each

                                      -2-
<PAGE>

      month that numerically corresponds to the Start Date. If a Libor Advantage
      Loan Interest Period is to end in a month for which there is no day which
      numerically corresponds to the Start Date, the Libor Advantage Loan
      Interest Period will end on the last day of such month.

      "Libor Advantage Rate" shall mean, relative to any Libor Advantage Loan
      Interest Period, the offered rate for delivery in two (2) London Banking

      approximately equal to such Libor Advantage Loan Interest Period. If the
      first (1st) day of any Libor Advantage Loan Interest Period is not a day
      which is both a (i) Business Day, and (ii) a day on which U.S. Dollar
      deposits are transacted in the London interbank market (a "London Banking
      Day"), the Libor Advantage Rate shall be determined in reference to the
      next preceding day which is both a Business Day and a London Banking Day.
      If for any reason the Libor Advantage Rate is unavailable and/or the Swing
      Line Lender is unable to determine the Libor Advantage Rate for any Libor
      Advantage Loan Interest Period, the Libor Advantage Rate shall be deemed
      to be equal to the Prime Rate.

      accordance with GAAP.

      7. The first sentence of Section 2.01(a) of the Loan Agreement is hereby
deleted in its entirety and in its stead is inserted the following:

      Subject to the terms and conditions and relying upon the representations
      and warranties set forth in this Agreement, the Notes and the other Loan
      Documents, the Banks severally (but not jointly) agree to make loans (the
      "Revolving Credit Loans") to the Borrowers at any time or from time to
      time on or after the Closing Date and to and including the Business Day
      immediately preceding the Expiry Date in an aggregate principal amount
      which, when combined with the aggregate principal amount of all Swing Line
      Loans outstanding and the aggregate Letter of Credit Undrawn Availability,
      shall not exceed at any one time outstanding Forty Million and 00/100
      Dollars ($40,000,000.00) (the "Revolving Credit Facility Commitment");
      provided, however, that no Bank shall be required to make Revolving Credit
      Loans (or participate in the issuance of Letters of Credit) in an
      aggregate principal amount outstanding at any one time exceeding such

      outstanding, the sum of the aggregate principal amount of all Swing Line
      Loans outstanding and the aggregate Letter of Credit Undrawn Availability
      shall not exceed the amount of the Revolving Credit Facility Commitment.

      amount of all Revolving Credit Loans outstanding, the sum of the aggregate
      principal amount of all Swing Line Loans outstanding and the aggregate
      Letter of Credit Undrawn Availability exceeds the amount of the Revolving
      Credit Facility Commitment (the "Excess Amount"), the Borrowers shall
      promptly, but in no event later than one Business Day thereafter, pay to
      the Agent (for the ratable benefit of the Banks) such Excess Amount.

      9. Article II of the Loan Agreement is hereby amended by inserting the
following as Section 2.01.5:

      and from time to time during the period from the Closing Date through and
      including the Business Day immediately preceding the earlier of (i) the
      date upon which the aggregate unpaid principal balance of the Swing Line

      the Cash Management Master Agreement, dated March 24, 2003, by and among
      the Swing Line Lender and the Borrowers which incorporates by reference
      the Cash Sweep Terms and Conditions executed by the Borrowers and accepted
      by the Swing Line Lender on March 24, 2003 (collectively, the "Cash
      Management Agreement"). Subject to the terms and conditions of this
      Agreement and the terms and conditions of the Cash Management Agreement,

      the Swing Line Loan available to the Borrowers at the Swing Line Lender's
      Office in immediately available funds not later than 2:00 p.m.,
      Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania time. Notwithstanding anything contained herein,
      the Swing Line Lender shall notify the Borrowers prior to terminating the
      Swing Line Loan Facility and/or the services provided under the Cash
      Management Agreement. The Swing Line Lender shall give notice to the Agent
      no later than 10:00 a.m. (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania time) of the next
      Business Day or such other time as the Agent and the Swing Line Lender may
      agree of the amount of each such Swing Line Loan.

            (d) Refunded Swing Line Loans. With respect to any Swing Line Loans,
      the Swing Line Lender may, at any time in its sole and absolute
      discretion, deliver to the Agent (with a copy to the Borrowers), no later
      than 10:00 a.m. (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania time) on the first (1st)
      Business Day immediately preceding the proposed date of disbursement, a
      notice (which shall be deemed to be a notice of borrowing given by an
      Authorized Representative) requesting the Banks to make Revolving Credit
      Loans that are Prime Rate Loans on such date in an amount equal to the
      lesser of (a) the amount of such Swing Line Loans outstanding on the date
      such notice is given which the Swing Line Lender requests the Banks to
      prepay or (b) the difference between the amount of the Swing Line Loan
      Facility minus the sum of (a) the Swing Line Lender's Pro Rata Share of
      Letter of Credit Undrawn Availability plus (b) the amount of the Swing
      Line Lender's outstanding Revolving Credit Loans (the lesser of (a) and
      (b) is the "Refunded Swing Line Loans"). Anything contained in this
      Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, (i) the proceeds of such
      Revolving Credit Loans made by Banks other than the Swing Line Lender
      shall be immediately delivered by the Agent to the Swing Line Lender (and
      not to the Borrowers) and applied to repay a corresponding portion of the
      Refunded Swing Line Loans and (ii) on the day such Revolving Credit Loans
      are made, the Swing Line Lender's Pro Rata Share of the Refunded Swing
      Line Loans shall be deemed to be paid with the proceeds of a Revolving
      Credit Loan made by the Swing Line Lender, and such portion of the Swing
      Line Loans deemed to be so paid shall no longer be


                                      -6-
<PAGE>

      outstanding as Swing Line Loans and shall no longer be due under the Swing
      Line Note of the Swing Line Lender but shall instead constitute part of
      the Swing Line Lender's outstanding Revolving Credit Loans and shall be
      due under the Revolving Credit Note of the Swing Line Lender.

            Anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, each
      Bank's obligation to make Revolving Credit Loans for the purpose of
      repaying any Refunded Swing Line Loans pursuant to the immediately
      preceding paragraph shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be
      affected by any circumstance, including (a) any set-off, counterclaim,
      recoupment, defense or other right which such Bank may have against the
      Swing Line Lender, the Borrowers or any other Person for any reason
      whatsoever; (b) the occurrence or continuation of an Event of Default or a
      Potential Default; (c) any Material Adverse Change; (d) any breach of this
      Agreement or any other Loan Document by the Borrowers; or (e) any other
      circumstance, happening or event whatsoever, whether or not similar to any
      of the foregoing; provided that such obligations of each Bank are subject
      to the condition that (X) the Swing Line Lender believed in good faith
      that all conditions under Article IV to the making of the applicable Swing
      Line Loans were satisfied at the time such Swing Line Loans were made or
      (Y) the satisfaction of any such condition not satisfied had been waived
      in writing by the Banks prior to or at the time such Swing Line Loans were
      made.

      10. The introductory clause of Section 2.02(a) of the Loan Agreement is
hereby deleted in its entirety and in its stead is inserted the following:

      Libor Advantage Loan Interest Period at the Libor Advantage Rate plus the
      Applicable Libor Margin as determined below and the aggregate outstanding
      principal balance of the Revolving Credit Loans shall be, at the option of
      the Borrowers as selected pursuant to Section 2.01(c) hereof, (x) Prime

            2.03 Interest Payments. The Borrowers shall pay to the Agent for the
      ratable account of the Banks interest on the aggregate outstanding balance
      of the Revolving Credit Loans which are Prime Rate Loans in arrears, on

      through and including the Expiry Date. The Borrowers shall pay to the
      Agent for the ratable account of the Banks interest on the unpaid
      principal balance of the Revolving Credit Loans that are Libor Rate Loans
      on the earlier of (i) the last day of the applicable Interest Period for
      such Loan or (ii) for such Loans with an applicable Interest Period
      exceeding three (3) months, on each and every three (3) month anniversary
      of each such Loan during the period from the Closing Date to and including
      the Expiry Date. The Borrowers shall pay to the Swing Line Lender interest
      on the unpaid principal balance of the aggregate outstanding balance of
      the Swing Line Loans in arrears, on each Libor Advantage Loan Interest
      Payment Date through and including the earlier of demand or the Expiry
      Date. After maturity of any part of the Loans (whether upon the occurrence
      of an Event of Default, by acceleration, demand or otherwise), interest on
      such part of the Loans shall be immediately due and payable upon delivery
      by the Agent of an invoice for such interest without further notice,
      presentment, or demand of any kind.

      12. Section 2.04(a) of the Loan Agreement is hereby deleted in its

      the Expiry Date, payable quarterly in arrears on the first (1st) day of
      each April, July, October and January of each calendar year and on the
      Expiry Date. Such fee shall be equal to the amount by which the amount of
      each Bank's Commitment has exceeded the average daily closing principal
      balance of the sum of such Bank's Revolving Credit Loans (for purposes of
      this computation, the Swing Line Loans shall be deemed to be borrowed
      amounts under the Revolving Credit Commitment of Citizens) plus its Pro
      Rata Share of the Letter of Credit Undrawn Availability during the
      preceding calendar quarter, multiplied by three-eights of one percent
      (0.375%), multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the actual
      number of days in such calendar quarter and the denominator of which is
      three hundred sixty (360); and (ii) the Letter of Credit Commission
      pursuant to Section 2.06 hereof.

      Borrowers to the Swing Line Lender in the original principal amount not to

deliver this Fourth Amendment, (ii) the officers of such Borrower executing this
Fourth Amendment have been duly authorized to execute and deliver the same and
bind such Borrower with respect to the provisions hereof, (iii) the execution

      21. The agreements contained in this Fourth Amendment are limited to the
specific agreements made herein. Except as amended hereby, all of the terms and
conditions of the Loan Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. This

enforced in accordance with, the Laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
