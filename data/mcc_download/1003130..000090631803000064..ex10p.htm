Upon and after the occurrence of any Event of Default or the maturity of this Note (by acceleration or otherwise), the principal balance under this Note, together with any arrearage of interest, will bear interest at the Default Rate until paid in full, whether before or after judgment. Borrower also waives all defenses based on suretyship or impairment of collateral. Upon this Note becoming due under any of its terms and provisions, and not being fully paid and satisfied, the total sum then due hereunder may, at any time and from time to time, be charged against any account or accounts maintained with Lender hereof by Borrower, without notice to or further consent from Borrower and Borrower agrees to be and remain liable for all remaining indebtedness represented by this Note in excess of the amount or amounts so applied.</P>

No single or partial exercise of any right or remedy by Lender will preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or remedy. All remedies hereunder, under any of the other Loan Documents, or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity are cumulative and none of them will be exclusive of the others or of any other right or remedy. All such rights and remedies may be exercised separately, successively, concurrently, independently or cumulatively from time to time and as often and in such order as Lender may deem appropriate.</P>

The provisions of this paragraph will be and remain effective notwithstanding any contrary action which may have been taken by Borrower in reliance upon such payment or transfer, and any such contrary action so taken will be without prejudice to Lender&#8217;s rights hereunder and will be deemed to have been conditioned upon such payment or transfer having become final and irrevocable. The provisions of this paragraph will survive any termination, cancellation or discharge of this Note.</P>
