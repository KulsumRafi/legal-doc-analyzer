restrictions  or known claims of any kind, nature, or description, the number of
shares  of  common stock, Series A preferred stock, and Series B preferred stock

or  certificates  representing  such  World  Golf  shares  to the Company or its
registrar  or  transfer  agent,  be  entitled  to  receive  a  certificate  or
certificates  evidencing his proportionate interest in the Initial Shares.  Upon
consummation  of  the transaction contemplated herein, assuming participation by
all  of the World Golf Shareholders, all of the shares of capital stock of World
Golf  shall  be  held by the Company.  As additional consideration for the World
Golf  Shareholders  to  exchange their shares, Novus shareholders have agreed to
place  3,000,000  of their shares in escrow with David M. Loev, Attorney at Law,
to  be  released upon Imperium Capital, Inc. and/or another entity designated by
the Company raising capital to be utilized in World Golf's business of a minimum
of  $500,000,  of  which the parties agree that $50,000 has already been raised.
In  the  event  Imperium Capital and/or parties designated by the Company do not
raise  a minimum of $500,000, the 3,000,000 shares of Company common stock shall
be  returned  to  the  Company  for cancellation.  In the event Imperium Capital
and/or  parties  designated by the Company do not raise a minimum of $1,000,000,
which  includes  the $500,000 mentioned above, the World Golf Shareholders shall
receive  an aggregate of 3,000,000 shares of newly issued restricted stock to be
distributed  on  a  pro  rata  basis.

          (i)  there  shall  be  any  actual  or threatened action or proceeding
     before  any  court  or  any governmental body which shall seek to restrain,
     prohibit, or invalidate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and

or  liability  shall arise hereunder, except that Purchaser shall bear the costs
in connection with the negotiation, preparation, and execution of this Agreement
and  qualifying  the  offer  and sale of securities to be issued in the Exchange
under  the  registration  requirements,  or  exemption  from  the  registration
requirements,  of  state  and  federal  securities  laws.

     (c)     This Agreement may be terminated by the board of directors of World
Golf  at  any  time  prior  to  the  Closing  Date  if:

     that  one  or  more of World Golf's conditions to Closing has not occurred,
     through  no  fault  of  World  Golf;

          (iii)  World  Golf  takes  the termination action specified in Section
     2.18  as  a  result of the Company Schedules or updates thereto which World
     Golf  finds  unacceptable;

          (iv)  on  or  before January 31, 2003, World Golf notifies the Company
     that  World  Golf's  investigation  pursuant  to  Section  4.01  below  has
     uncovered  information which it finds unacceptable by the same criteria set
     forth  in  Section  2.18;  or

          (v)  The Company shall fail to comply in any material respect with any
     of its covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement or if any of the
