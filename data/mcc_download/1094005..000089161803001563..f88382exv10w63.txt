      Re:   JOINT VENTURE IN PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA

Dear Kim:

We refer to certain shareholders agreement (the "SA") dated November 22, 2002
between NCsoft and SINA.com concerning a joint venture in the People's Republic
of China ("China"). Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have
the meaning ascribed thereto in the SA.

1.    SINA.com and NCsoft agree that, in the event where the relevant Chinese
      laws (or enforcement practice) relating to the business operation
      conducted through the Company and the ICP Company are clarified or
      modified (by way of legislative enactment or amendment, promulgation or
      amendment of regulations, rules or guidelines, court or administrative
      precedent, or other similar action) and if, in the opinion (set forth in a
      formal legal opinion) of King & Wood or other reputable Chinese legal
      counsel acceptable to SINA.com and NCsoft, (i) the structure through which
      the Company and the ICP Company are conducting business could be modified
      to reduce legal risks, SINA.com and NCsoft shall cooperate with each other
      in good faith and modify the structure in a way recommended by such legal
      counsel or (ii) the structure through which the Company and the ICP
      Company are conducting business would be viewed as in violation of Chinese
      law or otherwise contrary to a policy of any Chinese government authority,
      SINA.com and NCsoft shall cooperate with each other in good faith and
      cause the Company and the ICP Company to cease and wind up their business
      operation as promptly as possible so as to minimize any sanctions or
      liabilities that may be imposed in connection therewith. SINA.com and
      NCsoft acknowledge

      and agree that any actions taken by each party in order to implement (i)
      or (ii) above shall not be deemed as breach or violation of any terms of
      the SA or other documents executed in connection therewith. Without
      limiting the generality of the foregoing, SINA.com and NCsoft acknowledge
      and agree that each party is entitled to request the immediate suspension
      of all or any part of the business of the Company and ICP company when, in
      such party's reasonable opinion based on reputable Chinese legal counsel's
      advice acceptable to the other party, the legal risk involved becomes
      serious or considerable so that it is highly recommendable to immediately
      suspend the said business.

2.    In consideration of the Parties' designation under the SA of an ICP
      Company established (or to be established) by SINA.com ("Sina-ICP"), which
      is an affiliate of SINA.com, as the ICP Company through which on-line game
      services for Lineage and other games to be sub-licensed by the Company
      will be provided to end users in the Territory, SINA.com represents,
      warrants and covenants each of the following:

      (i)   Sina-ICP has duly obtained and will at all times maintain an ICP
            license that is necessary for the conduct of on-line game operation
            business and the collection of revenue of such on-line game
            operation from end users directly or indirectly and will at all
            times make commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all other
            necessary and appropriate licenses to be required (by way of
            legislative enactment or amendment, promulgation or amendment of
            regulations, rules or guidelines, court or administrative precedent,
            or other similar action) for the conduct of on-line game operation
            business and the collection of revenue of such on-line game
            operation from end users directly or indirectly.

      (ii)  Sina-ICP shall be bound by and subject to the same non-competition
            restriction on SINA.com as set forth in the SA.

      (iii) Sina-ICP will maintain separate financial books and records for its
            on-line game service operation and other related business relating
            to Lineage or other games licensed by NCsoft or the Company and keep
            funds relating to such matters separate (not commingle them with
            funds from its other businesses) and will at all times conduct its
            business operations relating to Lineage and be subject to audit by
            the Parties and the Company in accordance with the ICP Agreements.

      (iv)  If NCsoft (a) has a basis to deem it desirable to replace Sina-ICP
            with another ICP Company from a legal risk reduction or business
            improvement perspective (which basis shall be reasonably acceptable
            to SINA.com and shall not be based solely on NCsoft's lack of share
            ownership or shareholder voting right over Sina-ICP) or (b) finds in
            its reasonable discretion that Sina-ICP is in breach of any
            obligations, representations or provisions set forth in the ICP
            Agreements (provided that such breach is not due to the Company's
            failure to provide services or assistance to Sina-ICP in accordance
            with the Technical Services Agreement (the "TSA") entered into
            between the Company and Sina-ICP) or herein or that other
            termination cause (excluding termination by the Company at will
            pursuant to Section 11(b)(vi) of the ICP License Agreement ("ICP
            License Agreement")
