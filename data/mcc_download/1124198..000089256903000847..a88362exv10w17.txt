                                                                POLICY/PROCEDURE

THIS FLUOR ENTERPRISES, INC. POLICY IS SUBJECT TO MODIFICATION OR REVISION IN
PART OR IN ITS ENTIRETY TO REFLECT CHANGES IN CONDITIONS SUBSEQUENT TO THE
EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS POLICY.

SUBJECT: BUSINESS ETHICS AND CONDUCT

HR-148
EFFECTIVE DATE:  03-03-03
SUPERSEDES:      08-05-02

I.       POLICY

         Employees are expected to adhere to the highest standards of business
         ethics and to conduct themselves and Fluor's business in a manner that
         will safeguard the company's reputation and retain the respect of its
         shareholders and all who associate with Fluor. No one in Fluor may give
         any order or directive that would violate the principle of strict
         adherence to the law, regulations governing company activities, or this
         policy. Fluor has additional policies in place that supplement and
         support the standards of conduct in this policy. Employees are expected
         to adhere to these and all other company policies as well.

II.      STANDARDS OF CONDUCT

         A.       CONFLICTS OF INTEREST AND MISAPPROPRIATION OF CORPORATE
                  OPPORTUNITIES:

                  1.       Employees must avoid circumstances giving rise to
                           potential bias due to conflicting personal interests
                           and investments not consistent with the employee's
                           performance of company business. In addition,
                           employees are prohibited from taking for themselves
                           opportunities related to Fluor's business, using
                           Fluor's property, information, or position for
                           personal gain, or competing with Fluor for business
                           opportunities.

                  2.       The company recognizes that the complexities of
                           personal and company interests may occasionally
                           result in situations where employees feel compelled
                           to excuse themselves from a particular transaction
                           because of inability to preclude the appearance of
                           bias or the occurrence of personal gain at the
                           expense of the company. To facilitate the avoidance
                           of such circumstances and to protect both employees
                           and the company, all potential personal conflicts and
                           all opportunities that relate to Fluor's business
                           must be disclosed in writing upon initial employment
                           with the company, at the time of the re-certification
                           of this policy, and at any other time in the course
                           of employment when potential conflict situations or
                           opportunities that relate to Fluor's business arise.

                  3.       Employees must disclose to their supervisors,
                           management, Human Resources or the Ethics Hotline
                           (see Section III of this policy) circumstances,
                           investments, interests, or affiliations which could
                           reasonably be expected to:

                           a.       Create the appearance of personal gain at
                                    company expense (including, but not limited
                                    to, opportunities that relate to Fluor's
                                    business);

                           b.       Create the appearance of preferential
                                    treatment or lack of impartiality;

                           c.       Impede company economy or efficiency;

                           d.       Result in a loss of independence and
                                    objectivity;

                           e.       Reflect poorly on the company or its
                                    clients; or

                                                        EFFECTIVE DATE: 03-03-03

FLUOR HUMAN RESOURCES POLICY

                                                                POLICY/PROCEDURE

THIS FLUOR ENTERPRISES, INC. POLICY IS SUBJECT TO MODIFICATION OR REVISION IN
PART OR IN ITS ENTIRETY TO REFLECT CHANGES IN CONDITIONS SUBSEQUENT TO THE
EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS POLICY.

SUBJECT: BUSINESS ETHICS AND CONDUCT

                           f.       Have the effect of diminishing the trust and
                                    confidence of the public, the government,
                                    our clients, or other employees in the
                                    company.

                  4.       Employees must notify a supervisor, member of
                           management or member of Human Resources before
                           accepting membership on any for-profit board of
                           directors.

                  5.       Officers must disclose any circumstances,
                           investments, interests, or affiliations described in
                           Section II.A.3. (a) through (f) of this policy to the
                           Senior Vice President Law. Officers must notify the
                           Senior Vice President Law before accepting membership
                           on any board of directors, whether of a charitable
                           organization, or otherwise.

         B.       CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION: Many aspects of Fluor's business,
                  with the exception of those normally found in the public
                  domain, are confidential and proprietary information and are
                  only to be shared with co-workers on a need-to-know basis.
                  This includes, but is not necessarily restricted to,
                  technologies and concepts, financial position, construction or
                  expansion plans, computer programs, process data, bid data,
                  and employee histories / pay, or any business plans of Fluor's
                  clients, partners, customers, suppliers, and contractors. All
                  employees are required to sign an agreement in which they
                  agree not to disclose confidential information belonging to
                  Fluor, its clients, or others with whom it does business.
                  Furthermore, Fluor recognizes the confidentiality of business
                  data and no employee shall seek to obtain such data through
                  collusion, bribery, or any illegal or unethical means.

         C.       ANTI-TRUST: Employees will not engage in any practice that
                  restricts trade and, as such, violates anti-trust regulations,
                  such as giving to, accepting from, or discussing with a
                  competitor, unpublished competitive data (prices or terms and
                  conditions of sales agreements). Employees may not enter into
                  any agreement or plan that would restrict competition.

         D.       ACCURATE RECORD-KEEPING AND REPORTING: Fluor's books, records,
                  accounts, and reports must accurately reflect its
                  transactions, and must be subject to an adequate system of
                  internal controls and disclosure controls to promote the
                  highest degree of integrity. Reports and documents that Fluor
                  files with or submits to the Securities and Exchange
                  Commission, and other public communications, should contain
                  full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure.

         E.       POLITICAL CONTRIBUTIONS AND ACTIVITIES: Participation and
                  involvement in public issues, including political activities,
                  are on the individual's own behalf and not on behalf of the
                  company. Employees may also, if they so choose, make voluntary
                  contributions to political causes which are solicited without
                  direction or coercion. Any such contribution or failure to
                  contribute shall not advantage or disadvantage the employee.

         F.       GOVERNMENT CONTRACTING: The statutes and regulations governing
                  business with or for governmental entities are complex and
                  impose different and special requirements from those
                  applicable to the private sector. Failure to comply with these
                  requirements may be a criminal offense. The company has
                  specific business conduct standards for this area. Any
                  questions regarding compliance should be referred to Fluor's
                  Legal Services Group.

         G.       BOYCOTT: Employees shall not engage in any organized effort on
                  behalf of the company to punish an organization by refusing to
                  buy, sell, or use its products or services. It is illegal for
                  Fluor or employees acting on its behalf to participate in or
                  cooperate with boycotts conducted by countries other than the
                  United States. When an issue over a boycott arises, employees
                  are expected to contact Fluor's Legal Services Group.

FLUOR HUMAN RESOURCES POLICY

                                                                POLICY/PROCEDURE

THIS FLUOR ENTERPRISES, INC. POLICY IS SUBJECT TO MODIFICATION OR REVISION IN
PART OR IN ITS ENTIRETY TO REFLECT CHANGES IN CONDITIONS SUBSEQUENT TO THE
EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS POLICY.

SUBJECT: BUSINESS ETHICS AND CONDUCT

         H.       INSIDER TRADING: Trading on inside information about a
                  corporation's securities or conveying such inside information
                  to others ("tipping") or suggesting that anyone purchase or
                  sell a corporation's securities while in possession of inside
                  information is strictly prohibited by law. An employee who,
                  during the course of his or her employment, has come into
                  possession of material non-public information relating to
                  Fluor or any other corporation, including any of its clients,
                  may not buy or sell the securities of that corporation. In
                  addition, the employee may not permit any member of his or her
                  immediate family or anyone acting on his or her behalf to
                  purchase or sell such securities.

         I.       CORPORATE ASSETS: Employees are expected to respect the
                  company's assets as they would their own. Corporate assets
                  take many forms (land, buildings, equipment, etc.), and
                  support daily work (desks, tools, computers, telephones,
                  etc.).

         J.       FAIR DEALING: Employees should deal fairly with Fluor's
                  customers, supplier, competitors and employees. No employee
                  should take unfair advantage of anyone through manipulation,
                  concealment, abuse of confidential, privileged or proprietary
                  information, or misrepresentation of material facts.

         K.       BRIBES, PAYOFFS AND GRATUITIES: Employees must not bribe or
                  make payoffs to anyone, nor may they accept anything of more
                  than nominal value from anyone with whom Fluor does business
                  (suppliers, contractors, clients, etc.).

         L.       COPYRIGHTS: In accordance with United States law, no employee
                  shall make unauthorized copies of copyrighted materials such
                  as books, magazines, newspapers, periodicals, computer
                  programs, or user manuals.

         M.       COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND REGULATIONS: Employees shall comply
                  with all applicable laws and regulations including those
                  applicable to the conduct of business with governmental
                  bodies, which include, but are not limited to, those regarding
                  cost accounting, time charging, national security,
                  procurement, and discrimination.

III.     COMMUNICATIONS AND REPORTING

         A.       ENCOURAGING OPEN COMMUNICATION: No policy can anticipate every
                  situation that may arise. Accordingly, this policy is not
                  meant to be all-inclusive, but rather is intended to serve as
                  a source of guiding principles and to encourage communication
                  and dialogue between employees and supervisors concerning
                  standards of conduct addressed in the policy. Employees are
                  encouraged to discuss with any supervisor, manager or member
                  of Human Resources questions about particular circumstances
                  that may implicate the provisions of this policy.

         B.       REPORTING OBLIGATIONS: Employees who believe that Fluor's
                  standards are not being practiced are required to report the
                  circumstances to their supervisors, managers or a member of
                  Human Resources, Retaliation for reports of misconduct by
                  others made in good faith is prohibited by law, and Fluor will
                  not permit retaliation of any kind against any employee who
                  reports misconduct in good faith.

         C.       ETHICS HOTLINE: In the event that an employee does not want to
                  report internally, the company has an Ethics Hotline which is
                  managed by an external organization specializing in compliance
                  and reporting issues. Employees may call the hotline at
                  1-800-223-1544 to report potential legal, ethical, accounting
                  or auditing violations or concerns. Any calls to the Ethics
                  Hotline may be made anonymously, although employees are
                  encouraged to identify themselves so that a full confidential
                  investigation is possible.
