subject to the terms and conditions set forth below. The Option granted hereby
shall be subject to the following terms and conditions:

     (a) Transfer of Option.
         ------------------

          Neither the whole nor any part of this Option shall be transferable
     by the Optionee or by operation of law during the Optionee's lifetime,
     and at the Optionee's death this Option or any part thereof shall only be
     transferable by the Optionee's will or by the laws of descent and
     distribution. This Option may be exercised during the lifetime of the
     Optionee only by the Optionee. This Option, and any and all rights
     granted to the Optionee hereby, to the extent not theretofore effectively
     exercised shall automatically terminate and expire upon any sale,
     transfer or hypothecation or any attempted sale, transfer or
     hypothecation of the Option or such rights, or upon the bankruptcy or
     insolvency of the Optionee.

     (b) Death.
         -----

          (i) If the Optionee shall die, the Option granted hereby to such
     deceased Optionee shall be exercisable within one (1) year after the
     date of the Optionee's death, and the Option shall be exercisable for all
     of the shares covered hereby.

          (ii) The legal representative, if any, of the deceased Optionee's
     estate, otherwise the appropriate legatees or distributees of the
     deceased Optionee's estate may exercise this Option on behalf of the
     Optionee.

     (c) Termination of Option Rights for Cause.
         --------------------------------------

          Anything contained herein notwithstanding, if harm to the Corporation
     is caused as a result of or caused by the Optionee's theft or embezzlement
     from the Corporation, the violation of a material term or condition of any
     agreement between Optionee and the

                                      3

<PAGE>

     Corporation, the disclosure by the Optionee of confidential information
     of the Corporation, the Optionee's stealing trade secrets or intellectual
     property owned by the Corporation, any act by the Optionee in competition
     with the Corporation or any other act, activity or conduct of the
     Optionee which in the opinion of the Board Committee of the Board of
     Directors is adverse to the best interests of the Corporation, then this
     Option and any and all rights granted to such Optionee hereunder, to the
     extent not yet effectively exercised, shall become null and void
     effective as of the date of the occurrence of such event, and any
     purported exercise of the Option by or on behalf of the Optionee
     following such date shall be of no effect.

     (d) Acceleration.
         ------------

          The Corporation may, in the case of merger, consolidation,
     dissolution or liquidation of Spiegel, accelerate the expiration date of
     this Option for any or all of the shares covered thereby (but still
     giving the Optionee a reasonable period of time to exercise the Option
     with respect to any portion thereof outstanding prior to the accelerated
     expiration date) and may, in the case of merger, consolidation,
     dissolution or liquidation of Spiegel, or in any other case in which it
     feels it is in the Corporation's best interest, accelerate the date or
     dates on which this Option or any part of this Option shall be
     exercisable for any or all of the shares covered thereby.

     (e) Rights as a Stockholder.
         -----------------------

          The Optionee shall have no rights as a stockholder with respect to
     any shares covered by this Option until the date that Spiegel receives
     payment in full for the purchase of said shares pursuant to the effective
     exercise of this Option. No adjustment shall be made for

                                      4

<PAGE>

     dividends or distributions or other rights for which the record date is
     prior to the date such payment is received by Spiegel except as provided
     in paragraph (f) below. Spiegel shall not be required to issue or deliver
     any certificate for shares of its Class A Stock purchased upon the exercise
     of all or any part of this Option before (1) the admission of such shares
     to listing on any stock exchange on which such stock may then be listed,
     or, if applicable, approved for inclusion on the National Market System of
     the NASD and (2) completion of any registration or other qualification of
     such shares under any state or federal law or ruling or regulation of any
     governmental regulatory body that Spiegel shall, in its sole discretion,
     determine is necessary or advisable.

     (f) Stock Dividend; Recapitalization; Consolidation.
         -----------------------------------------------

          If any stock dividend shall be declared upon the Class A Stock or
     if the Class A Stock shall hereafter be subdivided, consolidated, or
     changed into other securities of Spiegel, or a successor corporation to
     Spiegel, then in each event, shares of Class A Stock which would be
     delivered pursuant to exercise of any option hereunder shall, for the
     purpose of adjusting the number and kind thereof, be treated as though
     outstanding immediately prior to the occurrence of such event, and the
     purchase price to be paid therefore shall be appropriately adjusted to
     give effect thereto. The grant of an option hereunder shall not affect in
     any way the right or power of Spiegel to make adjustments,
     reclassifications, reorganizations or changes of its capital or business
     structure or to merge or to consolidate or to dissolve, liquidate or sell,
     or transfer all or any part of its business assets.
