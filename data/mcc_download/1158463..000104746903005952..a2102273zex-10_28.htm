participate in the Plan pursuant to Section&nbsp;3.2. If the Eligible Employee fails to make an initial salary deferral election within such time, then such Eligible Employee may thereafter make an
election in accordance with the rules governing modifications. Such election shall constitute a biding salary reduction agreement between such Employee and the Employer and shall be filed with the
Administrator. Such election shall initially be effective beginning with the pay period during which or next following the acceptance of the salary reduction agreement by the Administrator, or as
otherwise specified in rules established by the Administrator hereunder. The election shall not have retroactive effect, and shall remain in force until modified or revoked. </FONT></P>

as a result of a reasonable error in estimating a Participant's Compensation, a reasonable error in determining the amount of elective deferrals (within the meaning
of Code Section&nbsp;402(g)(3)) that may be made with respect to any Participant under the limits of Section&nbsp;4.9 or other facts and circumstances to which
Regulation&nbsp;1.415-6(b)(6) shall be applicable, the "annual additions" under this Plan would cause the maximum "annual additions" to be exceeded for any Participant, the "excess
amount" will be disposed of in the following manner: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Participant's share of the Employer's discretionary contributions pursuant to Section&nbsp;4.1(c) will be reduced to the extent necessary to reduce the "excess
amount." The amount so reduced shall be held unallocated in a "Section&nbsp;415 suspense account" and will thereafter be applied to reduce future Employer contributions in the succeeding "limitation
years" as provided in Regulation&nbsp;1.415-6(b)(6)(i). </FONT></P>
