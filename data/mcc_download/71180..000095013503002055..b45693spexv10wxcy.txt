1.    PARTIES:

            The Parties to this Western Systems Power Pool Agreement
            (hereinafter referred to as "Agreement") are those entities that
            have executed this Agreement, hereinafter sometimes referred to
            individually as "Party" and collectively as "Parties," but excluding
            any such entity that withdraws its participation in the Agreement.

2.    RECITALS:

      2.1   The WSPP experiment has been successfully concluded. Its main
            purpose was to determine the feasibility of a marketing arrangement
            which would increase the efficiency of interconnected power system
            operations above that already being accomplished with existing
            agreements through increased market knowledge and market pricing of
            commodities.

      2.2   The Parties now desire to proceed with a similar marketing
            arrangement on a long term basis for prescheduled and real-time
            coordinated power transactions, such as economy energy transactions,
            unit commitment service, firm system capacity/energy sales or
            exchanges. Accordingly, this Agreement, together with any applicable
            Confirmation Agreement, sets forth the terms and conditions to
            implement these services within any applicable rate ceilings set
            forth in the Service Schedules in conformance with FERC orders where
            applicable.

            Party a bill within two (2) years from the date on which the bill
            would have been delivered under Section 9.1 of this Agreement. The

            Within a two (2) year period from the date the first bill was
            delivered under this Agreement, any Party to that transaction may
            request in writing copies of the records of the other Party for that

            documents and data within a reasonable time period.

10.   UNCONTROLLABLE FORCES:

            No Party shall be considered to be in breach of this Agreement or
      any applicable Confirmation Agreement to the extent that a failure to
      perform its obligations under this Agreement or any such Confirmation
      Agreement shall be due to an Uncontrollable Force. The term
      "Uncontrollable Force" means an event or circumstance which prevents one
      Party from performing its obligations under one or more transactions,
      which event or circumstance is not within the reasonable control of, or
      the result of the negligence of the claiming Party, and which by the
      exercise of due diligence, the claiming Party is unable to avoid, cause to
      be avoided, or overcome. "Uncontrollable Forces" may include and are not
      restricted to flood, drought, earthquake, storm, fire, lightning,
      epidemic, war, riot, civil disturbance or disobedience, labor dispute,
      labor or material shortage, sabotage, restraint by court order or public
      authority, and action or nonaction by, or failure to obtain the necessary
      authorizations or approvals from, any governmental agency or authority.

      Party to settle any strike or labor dispute in which it may be involved.
      Any Party rendered unable to fulfill any of its obligations by reason of
      an Uncontrollable Force shall give prompt notice of such fact and shall
      exercise due diligence, as provided above, to remove such inability within
      a reasonable time period. If oral notice is provided, it shall be promptly
      followed by written notice.

            Notwithstanding the "due diligence" obligations or obligations to
      remove or remedy the causes set forth in the foregoing paragraph (which do
      not apply to this paragraph except as specified below), where the entity
      providing transmission services for transactions under any Service
      Schedule interrupts such transmission service, the interruption in
      transmission service shall be considered an Uncontrollable Force under
      this Section 10 only in the following two sets of circumstances: (1) An
      interruption in transmission service shall be considered an

            Uncontrollable Force if (a) the Parties agreed on a transmission
            path for that transaction at the time the transaction under this
            Agreement was entered into by the Parties' thereto, (b) firm
            transmission involving that transmission path was obtained pursuant
            to a transmission tariff or contract to effectuate the transaction
            under the applicable Service Schedule, and (c) the entity providing
            transmission service curtailed or interrupted such firm transmission
            pursuant to the applicable transmission tariff or contract;

      (2)   if the Parties did not agree on the transmission path for a
            transaction at the time the transaction was entered into, an
            interruption in transmission service shall be

            considered an Uncontrollable Force only if (a) the Party contracting
            for transmission services shall have made arrangements with the
            entity providing transmission service for firm transmission to
            effectuate the transaction under the applicable Service Schedule,
            (b) the entity providing transmission service curtailed or
            interrupted such transmission service due to an event of
            Uncontrollable Forces or provision of like effect, and (c) the Party
            which contracted for such firm transmission services could not
            obtain alternate energy at the delivery point, alternate
            transmission services, or alternate means of delivering energy after
            exercising due diligence.

            No Party shall be relieved by operation of this Section 10 of any
      liability to pay for power delivered to the Purchaser or to make payments
      then due or which the Party is obligated to make with respect to
      performance which occurred prior to the Uncontrollable Force.

11.   WAIVERS:

            Any waiver at any time by any Party of its rights with respect to a
      default under this Agreement or any Confirmation Agreements, or any other
      matter under this Agreement, shall not be deemed a waiver with respect to
      any subsequent default of the same or any other matter.

      13.1  This Agreement is subject to valid laws, orders, rules and
            regulations of duly constituted authorities having jurisdiction.
            Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give FERC jurisdiction
            over those Parties not otherwise subject to such jurisdiction or be
            construed as a grant of jurisdiction over any Party by any state or
            federal agency not otherwise having jurisdiction by law.

      13.2  This Agreement, including any Service Schedule hereto, shall become

            exceed the maximum rates in the applicable Service Schedule and are
            consistent with the terms and conditions of said Service Schedule.
            If, upon filing of this Agreement by Parties subject to FERC
            jurisdiction under the Federal Power Act, FERC orders a hearing to
            determine whether this Agreement or a Service Schedule under this
            Agreement is just and reasonable under the Federal Power Act, the
            Agreement or Service Schedule shall not become effective until the
            date when an order issued by FERC, determining this Agreement or the
            Service Schedule to be just and reasonable without changes or new
            conditions unacceptable to the Parties, is no longer subject to
            judicial review. Any changes or conditions imposed by any agency or
            court, including FERC ordering a hearing, shall be cause for
            immediate withdrawal by any nonconsenting Party.

      13.3  The Parties subject to FERC jurisdiction under the Federal Power Act
            shall have the right to terminate their participation in this

14.   TRANSFER OF INTEREST IN AGREEMENT:

            No Party shall voluntarily transfer its membership under this
      Agreement without the written consent and approval of all other Parties
      except to a Successor in Operation of such Party. With regard to the
      transfer of the rights and obligations of any Party associated with
      transactions under the Service Schedules, neither Party may assign such
      rights or obligations unless (a) the other Party provides its prior
      written consent which shall not be unreasonably withheld; or (b) the
      assignment is to a Successor in Operation which provides reasonable
      creditworthiness assurances (see Section 27 for examples of such
      assurances) if required by the non-assigning Party based upon its
      reasonably exercised discretion. Any successor or assignee of the rights
      of any Party, whether by voluntary transfer, judicial or foreclosure sale
      or otherwise, shall be subject to all the provisions and conditions of
      this Agreement and Confirmation Agreements (where applicable) to the same
      extent as though such successor or assignee were the original Party under
      this Agreement or the Confirmation Agreements, and no assignment or

            In the event that any of the terms, covenants or conditions of this
      Agreement or any Confirmation Agreement, or the application of any such
      term, covenant or condition, shall be held invalid as to any person or
      circumstance by any court, regulatory agency, or other regulatory body
      having jurisdiction, all other terms, covenants or conditions of this
      Agreement and the Confirmation Agreement and their application shall not
      be affected thereby, but shall remain in force and effect unless a court,
      regulatory agency, or other regulatory body holds that the provisions are
      not separable from all other provisions of this Agreement or such
      Confirmation Agreement.

      16.1  Any Electric Utility, Retail Entity or Qualifying Facility may

            of its decision within sixty (60) days of a request to become a
            Party to this Agreement, and any acceptable entity shall become a
            Party hereto by the execution of this Agreement or a counterpart
            hereof, payment of costs pursuant to Section 16.4, and concluding
            any necessary acceptance or approval referred to in Section 13. Any

      16.2  Each Party shall continue to meet the requirements of Section 16.1
            in order to remain a Party to this Agreement

      16.3  Being a Party to this Agreement shall not serve as a substitute for
            contractual arrangements that may be needed between any Party which
            operates a Control Area and any other Party which operates within
            that Control Area.

      16.4  Any entity that becomes a Party to this Agreement which was not a
            party to the experimental Western Systems Power Pool Agreement shall
            pay a one time fee of $25,000 under this Agreement in recognition of
            prior efforts and costs incurred by the parties to the experimental
            Western Systems Power Pool Agreement, which efforts greatly
            facilitated development of this Agreement. Such fee shall be
            credited to future costs of the Operating Agent incurred hereunder.

17.   RELATIONSHIP OF PARTIES:

      17.1  Nothing contained herein or in any Confirmation Agreement shall be
            construed to create an association, joint venture, trust, or
            partnership, or impose a trust or partnership covenant, obligation,
            or liability on or with regard to any one or more of the Parties.
            Each Party shall be individually responsible for its own covenants,
            obligations, and liabilities under this Agreement and under any
            applicable Confirmation Agreement.

            occur or result from the performance or non-performance of this

      21.2  [RESERVED]

      21.3  The following damages provision shall apply to transactions under
            Service Schedules B and C. For transactions under Service Schedule
            A, this damages provision or some other damages provision will apply
            only if such a damages provision is agreed to through a Confirmation
            Agreement. The damages under this Section 21.3 apply to a Party's
            failure to deliver or receive electric power or energy in violation
            of the terms of the Agreement and any Confirmation Agreement. The
            Contract Quantity and Contract Price referred to in this Section
            21.3 are part of the agreement between the Parties for which damages
            are being calculated under this Section.

                  be, the quantities of electric power or energy due under the

                        Price (Contract Price - Sales Price) and the amount by
                        which the quantity received by the Purchaser was less
                        than the hourly Contract Quantity; plus (b) the amount
                        of transmission charge(s), if any, for firm transmission
                        service upstream of the delivery point, which the Seller

                        commercial efforts to achieve such reduction). If the

            (b)   The Parties agree that the amounts recoverable under this
                  Section 21.3 are a reasonable estimate of loss and not a
                  penalty, and represent the sole and exclusive remedy for the
                  Performing Party. Such amounts are payable for the loss of
                  bargain and the loss of protection against future risks.

            (c)   Each Party agrees that it has a duty to mitigate damages in a
                  commercially reasonable manner to minimize any damages it may
                  incur as a result of the other Party's performance or
                  non-performance of this Agreement.

            (d)   In the event the Non-Performing Party disputes the
                  calculation of the damages under this Section 21.3, the
                  Non-Performing Party shall pay the full amount of the
                  damages as required by Section 9 of this Agreement to the
                  Performing Party.  After informal dispute resolution as
                  required by Section 34.1, any remaining dispute involving
                  the calculation of the damages shall be referred to binding
                  dispute resolution as provided by Section 34.2 of this
                  Agreement.  If resolution or agreement results in refunds
                  or the need for refunds to the Non-Performing Party, such
                  refunds shall be calculated in accordance with Section 9.4

      22.2  REMEDIES FOR EVENTS OF DEFAULT

                  If an Event of Default occurs, the Non-Defaulting Party shall
            possess the right to terminate all transactions between the Parties
            under this Agreement upon written notice (by facsimile or other
            reasonable means) to the Defaulting Party, such notice of
            termination to be effective immediately upon receipt. If the
            Non-Defaulting Party fails to exercise this right of termination
            within thirty (30) days following the time when the Event of Default
            becomes known (or more than thirty days if the Non-Defaulting and
            Defaulting Parties agree to an extension), then such right of
            termination shall no longer be available to the Non-Defaulting Party
            as a remedy for the Event(s) of Default. The Non-Defaulting Party
            terminating transaction(s) under this Section 22.2 may do so without
            making a filing at FERC.

                  Upon termination, the Non-Defaulting Party shall liquidate all
            transactions as soon as practicable, provided that in no event will
            the Non-Defaulting Party be allowed to liquidate Service Schedule A
            transactions. The payment associated with termination ("Termination
            Payment") shall be calculated in accordance with this Section 22.2
            and Section 22.3. The Termination Payment shall be the sole and

            other remedies available to it at law or otherwise.

                  Upon termination, the Non-Defaulting Party may withhold any
            payments it owes the Defaulting Party for any obligations incurred
            prior to termination under this Agreement or Confirmation
            Agreement(s) until the Defaulting Party pays the Termination Payment
            to the Non-Defaulting Party. The Non-Defaulting Party shall possess
            the right to set-off the amount due it under this Section 22 by any
            such payments due the Defaulting Party as provided in Section
            22.3(d).

                  The Non-Defaulting Party shall calculate the Termination
            Payment as follows:

            (a)   The Gains and Losses shall be determined by comparing the
                  value of the remaining term, transaction quantities, and
                  transaction prices under each Terminated Transaction had it
                  not been terminated to the equivalent quantities and relevant
                  market prices for the remaining term either quoted by a bona
                  fide third-party offer or which are reasonably expected to be
                  available in the market under a replacement contract for each
                  Terminated Transaction. To ascertain the market prices of a
                  replacement contract, the Non-Defaulting Party may consider,
                  among other valuations, quotations

                  and other bona fide third party offers, all adjusted for the
                  length of the remaining term and differences in transmission.
                  It is expressly agreed that the Non-Defaulting Party shall not
                  be required to enter into replacement transactions in order to
                  determine the Termination Payment.

            (b)   The Gains and Losses calculated under paragraph (a) shall
                  be discounted to present value using the Present Value Rate
                  as of the time of termination (to take account to the
                  period between the time notice of termination was effective
                  and when such amount would have otherwise been due pursuant
                  to the relevant transaction).  The "Present Value Rate"
                  shall mean the sum of 0.50% plus the yield reported on page

                  the Defaulting Party. If the Non-Defaulting Party's aggregate
                  Losses and Costs exceed its aggregate Gains, the Defaulting
                  Party shall, within three (3) Business Days of receipt of such
                  notice, pay the Termination Payment to the Non-Defaulting
                  Party, which amount shall bear interest at the Present Value
                  rate from the time notice of termination was received until
                  paid. If the Non-Defaulting Party's aggregate Gains exceed its
                  aggregate Losses and Costs, the Non-Defaulting Party, after
                  any set-off as provided in paragraph (d), shall pay the
                  remaining amount to the Defaulting Party within three (3)
                  Business Days of the date notice of termination was received
                  including interest at the Present Value from the time notice
                  of termination was received until the Defaulting Party
                  receives payment.

            (d)   The Non-Defaulting Party shall aggregate or set off, as
                  appropriate, at its election, any or all other amounts
                  owing between the Parties (discounted at the Present Value
                  Rate) under this Agreement and any Confirmation Agreements
                  against the  Termination Payment so that all such amounts
                  are aggregated and/or netted to a single liquidated
                  amount.  The net amount due from any such liquidation shall
                  be paid within three (3) Business Days following the date
                  notice of termination is received.

             If the Defaulting Party disagrees with the calculation of the
      Termination Payment and the Parties cannot otherwise resolve their
      differences, the calculation issue shall be submitted to informal dispute
      resolution as provided in Section 34.1

            to Section 34.2 if the informal dispute resolution does not succeed
            in resolving the dispute. Pending resolution of the dispute, the

            Payment calculated by the Non-Defaulting Party within three (3)
            Business Days of receipt of notice as set forth in Sections 22.3(c)

                  For purposes of this Section 22.3:

            (i)   "Gains" means the economic benefit (exclusive of Costs), if
                  any, resulting from the termination of the Terminated
                  Transactions, determined in a commercially reasonable manner
                  as calculated in accordance with this Section 22.3;

            (ii)  "Losses" means the economic loss (exclusive of Costs), if any,
                  resulting from the termination of the Terminated Transactions,
                  determined in a commercially reasonable manner as calculated
                  in accordance with this Section 22.3;

            (iii) "Costs" means brokerage fees, commissions and other similar
                  transaction costs and expenses reasonably incurred in
                  terminating any specifically related arrangements which
                  replace a Terminated Transaction, transmission and ancillary

                  with the Non-Defaulting Party enforcing its rights with regard
                  to the Terminated Transactions. The Non-Defaulting Party shall
                  use reasonable efforts to mitigate or eliminate these Costs.

            (iv)  In no event, however, shall a Party's Gains, Losses or Costs
                  include any penalties or similar charges imposed by the
                  Non-Defaulting Party.

      22A.  DEFAULT IN PAYMENT OF WSPP OPERATING COSTS:

            22A.1 A Party shall be deemed to be in default in payment of its
                  share of WSPP operating costs pursuant to Section 7 of this
                  Agreement, if any, when payment is not received within ten
                  (10) days after receipt of written notice. A default by any
                  Party in such payment obligations shall be cured by payment of
                  all overdue amounts together with interest accrued at the rate
                  of one percent (1%) per month, or the maximum interest rate
                  permitted by law, if any, whichever is less, prorated by days
                  from the due date to the date the payment curing the default
                  is made unless and until the Executive Committee shall
                  determine another rate.

            22A.2 A defaulting Party, which is in default under Section 22.A1,
                  shall be liable for all costs, including costs of collection
                  and reasonable attorney fees, plus interest as provided in
                  Section 22.A1 hereof.

            22A.3 The rights under this Agreement of a Party which is in default
                  of its obligation to pay operating costs under this Agreement
                  for a period of three (3) months or more may be revoked by a

                  Parties' representatives on the Executive Committee consistent
                  with Section 8.3. The defaulting Party's rights shall not be
                  revoked, however, unless said Party has received at least
                  thirty (30) days written notice of the non-defaulting Parties'
                  intent to revoke such rights. Said notice shall state the date
                  on which the revocation of rights shall become effective if
                  the default is not cured and shall state all actions which
                  must be taken or amounts which must be paid to cure the
                  default. This provision allowing the non-defaulting Parties to
                  revoke such rights is in addition to any other remedies
                  provided in this Agreement or at law and shall in no way limit
                  the non-defaulting Parties' ability to seek judicial
                  enforcement of the defaulting Party's obligations to pay its
                  share of the operating costs under this Agreement. Upon the
                  effective date of such revocation of rights, the defaulting
                  party shall not be allowed to enter into any new transactions
                  under this Agreement. The defaulting party under the Agreement
                  or any Confirmation Agreements shall be required to carry out
                  all obligations that existed prior to the effective date of
                  such revocation. If a defaulting Party's rights under this
                  Agreement have been revoked, the Executive Committee may
                  restore that Party's rights upon the defaulting Party paying
                  all amounts due and owing under this Agreement.

            22A.4 Upon revocation of the rights of a defaulting Party under this
                  Agreement, Operating Agent costs hereunder shall be equally

                  retroactive to the date of the default.

23.   OTHER AGREEMENTS:

            No provision of this Agreement shall preclude any Party from
      entering into other agreements or conducting transactions under existing
      agreements with other Parties or third parties. This Agreement shall not
      be deemed to modify or change any rights or obligations under any prior
      contracts or agreements between or among any of the Parties.

24.   GOVERNING LAW:

            This Agreement and any Confirmation Agreement shall be governed by
      and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Utah, without
      regard to the conflicts of laws rules thereof. The foregoing
      notwithstanding, (1) if both the Seller and Purchaser are organized under
      the laws of Canada, then the laws of the province of the Seller shall
      govern, or (2) if the Seller or Purchaser is an agency of or part of the
      United States Government, then the laws of the United States of America
      shall govern.

25.   JUDGMENTS AND DETERMINATIONS:

            Whenever it is provided in this Agreement that a Party shall be the
      sole judge of whether, to what extent, or under what conditions it will
      provide a given service, its exercise of its judgment shall be final and
      not subject to challenge. Whenever it is provided that (i) a service under
      a given transaction may be curtailed under certain conditions or
      circumstances, the existence of which are determined by or in the judgment
      of a Party, or (ii) the existence of qualifications for membership shall

      Executive Committee's determination or exercise of judgment shall be final

26.   COMPLETE AGREEMENT:

            This Agreement and any subsequent amendments, including the Service
      Schedules and Exhibits incorporated herein, and any Confirmation
      Agreement, shall constitute the full and complete agreement of the Parties
      with respect to the subject matter hereof, and all prior or
      contemporaneous representations, statements, negotiations, understandings
      and inducements are fully merged and incorporated in this Agreement.

27.   CREDITWORTHINESS:

            Should a Party's creditworthiness, financial responsibility, or
      performance viability become unsatisfactory to the other Party in such
      other Party's reasonably exercised discretion with regard to any
      transaction pursuant to this Agreement and any Confirmation Agreement
      (after the transaction is agreed to or begins), the dissatisfied Party
      (the "First Party") may require the other Party (the "Second Party") to
      provide, at the Second Party's option (but subject to the First Party's
      acceptance based upon reasonably exercised discretion), either (1) the
      posting of a Letter of Credit, (2) a cash prepayment, (3) the posting of
      other acceptable collateral or security by the Second Party, (4) a
      Guarantee Agreement executed by a creditworthy entity; or (5) some other
      mutually agreeable method of satisfying the First Party. The Second
      Party's obligations under this Section 27 shall be limited to a reasonable

      to fail to perform its obligations. Events which may trigger the First
      Party questioning the Second Party's creditworthiness, financial
      responsibility, or performance viability include, but are not limited to,
      the following:

      (1)   The First Party has knowledge that the Second Party (or its
            Guarantor if applicable) are failing to perform or defaulting under
            other contracts.

      (2)   The Second Party has exceeded any credit or trading limit set out in
            the Confirmation Agreement or other agreement between the Parties.

      (3)   The Second Party or its Guarantor has debt which is rated as
            investment grade and that debt falls below the investment grade
            rating by at least one rating agency or is below investment grade
            and the rating of that debt is downgraded further by at least one
            rating agency.

      (4)   Other material adverse changes in the Second Party's financial
            condition occur.

      (5)   Substantial changes in market prices which materially and adversely
            impact the Second Party's ability to perform under this Agreement or
            any Confirmation Agreement occur.

            If the Second Party fails to provide such reasonably satisfactory
      assurances of its ability to perform a transaction hereunder within three
      (3) Business Days of demand therefore, that will be considered an Event of

      that Section 22. Nothing contained in this Section 27 shall affect any
      credit agreement or arrangement, if any, between the Parties.

28.   NETTING:

      28.1  If the Purchaser and the Seller are each required to pay an amount
            to each other in the same calendar month for transactions under this
            Agreement, then such amounts with respect to each Party may be
            aggregated and the Parties may discharge their obligations to pay
            through netting of the respective amounts due, in which case the
            Party, if any, owing the greater aggregate amount may pay to the
            other Party the difference between the amounts owed. Each Party
            reserves to itself all rights, set-offs, counterclaims, and other
            remedies and defenses (to the extent not expressly herein waived or
            denied) which such Party has or may be entitled to arising from or
            out of this Agreement and any applicable Confirmation Agreements.

      28.2  Parties shall net payments (associated with transactions under this
            Agreement and Confirmation Agreement) in accordance with Exhibit A,
            if such Parties have executed the form attached as Exhibit A. The
            Parties obligation to net shall include the netting of all payments
            received by the Parties in the same calendar month. Parties that
            have executed Exhibit A shall provide a signed copy of

            Exhibit A to a representative of the WSPP and to any Party that
            requests a copy and indicate on the WSPP Homepage that they have so
            executed Exhibit A (once the WSPP Homepage possesses the necessary
            capability). If a Party indicated its election to net payments on
            the WSPP Homepage and that Party desires to withdraw its agreement
            to net, that Party shall provide at least 30 days notice on the WSPP
            Homepage of the change in its election to net and also shall
            provide, concurrent with its withdrawal notice, written notice to
            all Parties with which it has ongoing transactions or with which it
            has committed to future transactions under the Agreement at the time
            of the notice. Any such changes in netting status shall apply
            beginning at least 30 days after notice required by this Section
            28.2 is provided and only shall apply to transactions agreed to
            beginning on or after the date the change in netting status becomes
            effective.

      taxes. Either Party, upon written request of the other Party, shall
      provide a certificate of exemption or other reasonably satisfactory
      evidence of exemption if either Party is exempt from taxes, and shall use
      reasonable efforts to obtain and cooperate with the other Party in
      obtaining any exemption from or reduction of any tax. Taxes are any
      amounts imposed by a taxing authority associated with the transaction.

      disclosure is (1) required by law, (2) reasonably deemed by the disclosing
      Party to be required to be disclosed in connection with a dispute between
      or among the Parties, or the defense of any litigation or dispute, (3)
      otherwise permitted by consent of the other Party, which consent shall not

      confidentiality of any documents or confidential information covered by
      this provision, including, if appropriate, seeking a protective order or
      similar mechanism in connection with any disclosure. This provision shall
      not apply to any information that was or is hereafter in the public domain
      (except as a result of a breach of this provision).

            this Agreement may agree to modify any term of this Agreement which
            applies to such transaction (but not to provisions regarding the
            operation of the WSPP as an organization including Sections 7 and
            8), such agreement to be reflected in a Confirmation Agreement.
            Written confirmation shall be required for all transactions of one
            week or more. Upon request of the Purchaser or at the election of
            the Seller, the Seller shall provide written confirmation which must
            be received by the Purchaser within five Business Days of the date
            of the agreement or request. The Purchaser shall have five Business
            Days from date of receipt to respond to the confirmation. If the
            Purchaser does not respond within that time period, the Seller's
            written confirmation shall be considered as accepted and final
            except as provided in Section 32.5. If the Seller fails to provide
            any required written confirmation within five Business Days, as
            described above, then the Purchaser may submit a written
            confirmation to the Seller. The Purchaser shall submit such written
            confirmation within five Business Days after the deadline for
            submitting a written confirmation applicable to the Seller as set
            forth above has expired. If the Seller fails to respond to
            Purchaser's confirmation within five Business Days, then the
            Purchaser's written confirmation shall be considered as accepted and
            final except as provided in Section 32.5. Notwithstanding the
            foregoing, any failure of the Seller or the Purchaser to provide
            written confirmation of the transaction shall not invalidate any
            oral agreement of the Parties except for oral agreements prohibited
            by Section 32.5. Nor shall any oral agreement of the Parties be
            considered invalidated

      32.2  The Parties agree not to contest, or assert any defense with respect
            to, the validity or enforceability of any agreement to the terms
            concerning a specific transaction(s), on the basis that
            documentation of such terms fails to comply with the requirements of
            any statute that agreements be written or signed. Each Party
            consents to the recording by the other Party, without any further
            notice, of telephone conversations between representatives of the
            Parties, which contain agreements to or discussion concerning the
            terms of a specific transaction(s). All such recordings may be
            introduced and admitted into evidence for the purpose of proving
            agreements to terms, and any objection to such introduction or
            admission for such purpose is hereby expressly waived. The terms
            documented hereunder, whether stated in a written document or a
            recording, are intended by the Parties as a final expression of
            their agreement with respect to such terms as are included therein
            and may not be contradicted by evidence of any prior agreement, but
            may be supplemented by course of dealing, performance, usage of
            trade and evidence of consistent additional mutually agreed-upon
            terms.

      32.3  For individual transactions under the Service Schedules, the
            Agreement as it may be modified or supplemented by a Confirmation
            Agreement shall bind the Parties and govern the transactions;
            provided, however, if the Parties to a transaction do not reach
            agreement on such modification or change to a term of the Agreement,
            or the Confirmation Agreement is not considered accepted and final

            In the event of a conflict between a binding and effective
            Confirmation Agreement and this Agreement, the Confirmation
            Agreement shall govern.

      32.4  The Seller shall not be required to file written confirmations with
            FERC except as provided in the Service Schedules.

      32.5  When a Confirmation Agreement contains Non-Standard Confirmation
            Provisions which are provisions other than those set forth in
            paragraphs (a) - (l) of Exhibit C, those Non-Standard Confirmation
            Provisions shall not be deemed to be accepted pursuant to Section
            32.1 unless agreed to: (i) orally, with that oral agreement recorded
            (provided that such oral agreement option only shall be available
            for transactions of less than one week); or (ii) in a writing
            executed by both Parties.

      32.6  Other Products and Service Levels: The Parties may agree to use a
            product/service level defined by a different agreement (e.g., the
            California ISO tariff, the ERCOT agreement or the EEI agreement) for
            a particular transaction under this Agreement. Unless the Parties
            expressly state and agree that all the terms and conditions of such
            other agreement will apply to any such transaction, the transaction
            shall be subject to all the terms of this Agreement, except that (1)
            all service level/product definitions, (2) force
            majeure/uncontrollable force definitions, and (3) other terms as

      32.7  Written confirmation pursuant to this Section 32 may be provided in
            electronic format so long as the Parties to the affected transaction
            or transactions have agreed on the procedures and format for doing
            so.

            encumbrances arising or attaching prior to the delivery point and
            that Seller's sale is in compliance with all applicable laws and
            regulations. THE SELLER HEREBY DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES,
            EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR
            FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

34.   DISPUTE RESOLUTION:

      34.1  INFORMAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION

                  Before binding dispute resolution or any other form of
            litigation may proceed, any dispute between the Parties to a

            mediator from a list of ten (10) candidates provided by the Chairman
            of the WSPP Operating Committee or his or her designee. If the

            or indirect interest in either Party or the subject matter of the

            of mediators and the conduct of mediation and those procedures shall
            apply to the mediation.

      34.2  BINDING DISPUTE RESOLUTION

                  The Parties to a dispute may elect binding dispute resolution
            using the following process unless binding arbitration of certain
            disputes is required under this Agreement in which event the Parties
            shall use the process set forth in this Section 34.2 to resolve such
            disputes, unless the Parties otherwise agree:

            (a)   WSPP Dispute Resolution: A Party to a dispute (if binding
                  dispute resolution is required) or all Parties to a dispute
                  (if agreement of the Parties is required for binding dispute
                  resolution) may initiate binding dispute resolution under WSPP
                  procedures by notifying the Chairman of the WSPP Operating
                  Committee or his or her designee. The Chairman or his or her
                  designee shall provide the Parties with a list of ten (10)
                  eligible arbitrators. Within ten (10) days of receiving the
                  list, the Parties shall agree on a single arbitrator from the
                  list to conduct the arbitration, or notify the Chairman of the
                  Operating Committee or the designee of their inability to
                  reach agreement. If notified of the Parties inability to reach

                  arbitrators for the Parties to choose from or in selecting the
                  arbitrator (if the Parties are unable to do so) shall possess
                  a direct or indirect interest in either Party or the subject
                  matter of the arbitration. The Procedures to be used for this
                  arbitration shall follow the arbitration procedures which
                  shall be developed and maintained by the WSPP and the
                  procedures will be generally consistent with the commercial
                  arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association
                  though not involving the Association.

                  If the Parties agree to binding dispute resolution under this
            Section 34.2, each Party understands that it will not be able to
            bring a lawsuit concerning any dispute that may arise which is
            covered by this arbitration provision. Notwithstanding the
            foregoing, nothing herein is intended to waive any provision of the
            Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. Section 1, et. seq., or anY right
            under state statute or common law to challenge an arbitration award
            or to prevent any action to enforce any arbitration award.

                  A Party's liability and damages under any arbitration award
            resulting from the process set forth in this Section 34.2 shall be
            limited as provided in this Agreement or in any Confirmation
            Agreement.

                  Each Party shall be responsible for its own costs and those of
            its counsel and representatives. The Parties shall equally divide
            the costs of the arbitrator or mediator and the hearing.

      34.4  CONFIDENTIALITY

                  Any arbitration or mediation under this Section 34 shall be
            conducted on a confidential basis and not disclosed, including any
            documents or results which shall be considered confidential, unless
            the Parties otherwise agree or such disclosure is required by law.

35.   FORWARD CONTRACTS:

            The Parties acknowledge and agree that all transactions under the
      Agreement and Confirmation Agreement(s) are forward contracts and that the
      Parties are forward contract merchants, as those terms are used in the
      United States Bankruptcy Code. The Parties acknowledge and agree that all
      of their transactions, together with this Agreement and the related
      Confirmation Agreement(s) form a single, integrated agreement, and
      agreements and transactions are entered into in reliance on the fact that
      the agreements and each transaction form a single agreement between the
      Parties.

            The Parties intend that any Physically Settled Option under this
      Agreement shall qualify under the trade option exception, 17 C.F.R.
      Section 32.4. Accordingly, each Party buying or selling a Physically

38.   FLOATING PRICES:

      38.1  In the event the Parties intend that the price for a transaction is
            to be based on an index, exchange or any other kind of variable
            reference price (such price being a "Floating Price"), the Parties
            shall specify the "Floating Price" to be used to calculate the
            amounts in a Confirmation Agreement due Seller for that transaction.

      38.2  Market Disruption. If a Market Disruption Event has occurred and is
            continuing during the Determination Period, the Floating Price for
            the affected Trading Day shall be determined as follows. The Parties
            shall negotiate in good faith to agree on a Floating Price (or a
            method for determining a Floating Price) for the affected Trading
            Day. If the Parties have not so agreed on or before the twelfth
            Business Day following the first Trading Day on which the Market
            Disruption Event occurred or existed, then the Floating Price shall
            be determined in good faith by the Parties based upon (1) quotes
            from Dealers in energy contracts; and/or (2) quotes from Brokers in
            energy contracts. Each Party may obtain up to a maximum of four
            quotes which must be provided to the other Party no later than
            twenty-two Business Days following the first Business Day on which
            the Market Disruption Event occurred or existed. These quotes shall
            reflect transacted prices. The Floating Price for the affected
            Trading Day shall equal a simple average of the quotes obtained and
            provided by the Parties consistent with the provisions of this
            Section 38. Each Party providing quote(s) to the other Party also
            shall

            identify to that other Party the Dealer(s) and/or the Broker(s) who
            provided each of the quotes to allow verification. "Determination
            Period" means each calendar month during the term of the relevant
            transaction; provided that if the term of the transaction is less
            than one calendar month the Determination Period shall be the term
            of the transaction. "Market Disruption Event" means, with respect to
            an index, any of the following events (the existence of which shall
            be determined in good faith by the Parties): (a) the failure of the
            index to announce or publish information necessary for determining
            the Floating Price; (b) the failure of trading to commence or the
            permanent discontinuation or material suspension of trading in the
            relevant options contract or commodity on the exchange or market
            acting as the index; (c) the temporary or permanent discontinuance
            or unavailability of the index; (d) the temporary or permanent
            closing of any exchange acting as the index; or (e) a material
            change in the formula for or the method of determining the Floating
            Price.

            "Trading Day" means a day in respect of which the relevant price
            source published the relevant price or would have published the
            relevant price but for the Market Disruption Event.

      38.3  Calculation of Floating Price.  For the purposes of the
            calculation of a Floating Price, all numbers shall be rounded to
            three (3) decimal places.  If the fourth (4th) decimal number is
            five (5) or greater, then the third (3rd) decimal number shall be

            increased by one (1), and if the fourth (4th) decimal number is less
            than five (5), then the third (3rd) decimal number shall remain
            unchanged.

39.   AMENDMENT:

      39.1  This Agreement may be amended upon the submission to FERC and
            acceptance by FERC of that amendment. The Parties through the
            Executive Committee shall direct the filing of any amendments. The
            Parties to this Agreement agree to bound by this Agreement as it may
            be amended, provided that the Parties possess the right to challenge
            any amendments at FERC and to exercise any applicable withdrawal
            rights under this Agreement.

      39.2  Unless otherwise stated in the amendment, all amendments shall apply
            only to new transactions entered into or agreed to on or after the
            effective date of the amendment. Preexisting agreements and
            transactions shall operate under the version of the WSPP Agreement
            effective at the time of the agreement for the transaction unless
            the Parties to a transaction or transactions mutually agree
            otherwise.

      39.3  An agreement modifying this Agreement or a Confirmation Agreement
            for a transaction needs no consideration to be binding.

40.   EXECUTION BY COUNTERPARTS:

            This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, and
      upon execution by all Parties, each executed counterpart shall have the
      same force and effect as

                                     NETTING

      Each Party that executes this Exhibit A to the Agreement agrees to net
payments for transactions under WSPP Service Schedule A, B, and C with any other
Party or Parties which also have agreed to net payments by executing a copy of
this Exhibit A. The Party executing this Exhibit A shall indicate below when it
desires that its agreement to net becomes effective. A Party agreeing to net
under this Exhibit A shall comply with the provisions of Section 28.2 of the
Agreement. Defined terms used herein are as defined in the WSPP Agreement.
Netting shall be done in accordance with the following provision:

            If the Purchaser and Seller are each required to pay an amount on
            the payment due date in the same month for transactions under the
            Agreement or Confirmation Agreement, then such amounts with respect
            to each Party will be aggregated and the Parties will discharge
            their obligations to pay through netting, in which case the Party
            owing the greater aggregate amount will pay to the other party the
            difference between the amounts owed consistent with the payment
            times in Section 9.2 of the Agreement, unless the Parties have
            otherwise agreed to a different payment time as allowed by the
            Agreement. Each Party reserves to itself all rights, set-offs,
            counterclaims and other remedies and/or defenses to which it is or
            may be entitled, arising from or out of the Agreement. All
            outstanding payments between the Parties which are to be netted
            pursuant to this Exhibit A for transactions under WSPP Service
            Schedule A, B, and C shall be offset against each other or set off
            or recouped therefrom.

affecting creditor's rights or a petition for the Company's winding-up or
liquidation.

      5. AMENDMENT. No term or provision of this Guarantee shall be amended,
modified, altered, waived, or supplemented except in a writing signed by the

action against Guarantor under the terms hereof.

      Except as to applicable statutes of limitation, no delay of the Guaranteed
Party in the exercise of, or failure to exercise, any rights hereunder shall
operate as a waiver of such rights, a waiver of any other rights or a release of
Guarantor from any obligations hereunder.

      Guarantor consents to the renewal, compromise, extension, acceleration or
other changes in the time of payment of or other changes in the terms of the

termination, Guarantor shall have no further liability hereunder, except as
provided in the last sentence of this paragraph. No such termination shall be
effective until fifteen (15) Business Days after receipt by the Guaranteed Party
of such termination notice. No such termination shall affect Guarantor's
liability with respect to any obligations arising under any transaction entered
into prior to the time the termination is effective, which transaction shall
remain guaranteed pursuant to the terms of this Guarantee.

                  WSPP MEDIATION AND ARBITRATION PROCEDURES

I.    MEDIATION

      A.    INFORMAL MEDIATION.  WSPP members with a dispute or a potential
            dispute involving transactions under the WSPP Agreement may
            request non-binding, informal mediation by contacting the WSPP's
            General Counsel and by providing a brief explanation in writing
            of the dispute and the remedy being sought.  All parties to the
            dispute must request this Informal Mediation for it to become
            effective.  After this contact, a telephonic conference call will
            be arranged among the affected WSPP members and the WSPP's
            General Counsel, the Chairman of the Operating Committee, and/or
            some other independent and knowledgeable person requested by the
            Chairman of the Operating Committee to participate.  The purpose
            of the conference call will be to discuss the issues and to have
            an independent person or persons state their views.  Best efforts
            will be made to set up this conference call within five  Business
            Days after the WSPP's General Counsel is contacted subject to
            accommodating the schedules of all involved.  This Informal
            Mediation shall be considered as satisfying the Mediation
            requirements of Section 34.1 of the WSPP Agreement.

            with the procedures set forth in Section 34.1 of the WSPP Agreement.

            be to those individuals or entities specified in this procedures,
            but must include service to the Parties, the Mediator or
            Arbitrator (if either has been appointed), and to the WSPP

            via the Hub.

      A-3.4 Purchasers shall arrange purchases directly with Sellers, and shall
            be responsible for transmission arrangements.

      A-3.5 Unless otherwise mutually agreed between the Purchaser and the
            Seller, all Economy Energy Service transactions shall be
            pre-scheduled, and billings shall be based on amounts and prices
            agreed to in advance by schedulers, subject to Paragraphs A-3.6 and
            3.7 and subject to change by mutual agreement between dispatchers or
            schedulers due to system changes.

      A-3.6 The price for Economy Energy Service shall be mutually agreed to in
            advance between Seller and Purchaser and shall not be subject to the
            rate caps specified in Section A-3.7 in either of the following two
            circumstances:

            (1)   where the Seller is a FERC regulated public utility and that
                  Seller has been authorized to sell power like that provided
                  for under this Service Schedule at market-based rates; or

            (2)   where the Seller is not a FERC regulated public utility. A
                  Party is a FERC regulated public utility if it is a "public
                  utility" as defined in Section 201(e) of the Federal Power

            of sixteen (16) hours or less per day. The hourly rate is capped at
            the Seller's forecasted Incremental Cost plus 33.78(cent)/kW/ day.
            The total demand charge revenues in any consecutive seven-day period
            shall not exceed the product of the weekly rate and the highest
            demand experienced on any day in the seven-day period. In lieu of
            payment, such Parties may mutually agree to exchange economy energy
            at a ratio not to exceed that ratio provided for in Section C-3.7 of
            Service Schedule C. The Seller's forecasted Incremental Cost
            discussed above also may include any transmission and/or ancillary
            service costs associated with the sale, including the cost of any
            transmission and/or ancillary services that the Seller must take on
            its own system. Any such transmission and/or ancillary services
            charges shall be separately identified by the Seller to the
            Purchaser for transactions under this Schedule including the
            exchange of economy energy. The transmission and ancillary service
            rate ceilings shall be available through the WSPP's Hub or homepage.
            Any such transmission services (and ancillary service provided in
            conjunction with such transmission service) by Seller shall be
            provided pursuant to any applicable transmission tariff or
            agreement, and the rates therefore shall be consistent with such
            tariff or agreement.

                             UNIT COMMITMENT SERVICE

B-1   PARTIES:

      This Service Schedule is agreed upon as part of this Agreement by the
      Parties.

B-2   PURPOSE:

      The purpose of this Service Schedule is to define additional specific
      procedures, terms, and conditions for requesting and providing Unit
      Commitment Service.

B-3   TERMS:

      B-3.1 A Party may schedule Unit Commitment Service from another Party by
            mutual agreement; provided, however, that each Party shall be the
            sole judge as to the extent to and the conditions under which it is
            willing to provide or receive such service hereunder consistent with
            statutory requirements and contractual commitments including the
            Agreement and any applicable Confirmation Agreement. Once an
            agreement is reached, then the obligation for Unit Commitment
            Service becomes a firm commitment, for both Parties, for the agreed
            capacity and terms.

      B-3.2 Unless otherwise mutually agreed by the Parties involved in a Unit
            Commitment Service transaction, the terms set forth in this Service
            Schedule B shall govern such transaction.

      B-3.3 Unless otherwise agreed between the Purchaser and the Seller, all
            transactions shall be prescheduled, subject to any conditions agreed
            to by schedulers, for a specified unit for a specified period of
            time.

      B-3.4 Purchasers shall arrange purchases directly with Sellers.

      B-3.5 The price for Unit Commitment Service shall be mutually agreed to in
            advance between Seller and Purchaser and shall not be subject to the
            rate caps specified in Section B-3.6 in either of the following two
            circumstances:

            (1)   where the Seller is a FERC regulated public utility and that
                  Seller has been authorized to sell power like that provided
                  for under this Service Schedule at market-based rates; or

            (2)   where the Seller is not a FERC regulated public utility. A
                  Party is a FERC regulated public utility if it is a "public
                  utility" as defined in Section 201(e) of the Federal Power
                  Act, 16 U.S.C. Section 824(e).

      B-3.6 Except as provided for in Section B-3.5, the price shall not exceed
            the Seller's forecasted Incremental Cost plus up to: $7.32/kW/month;
            $1.68/kW/week; 33.78(cent)/kW/day; 14.07 mills/kWh; or 21.11
            mills/kWh for service of sixteen (16) hours or less per day. The
            hourly rate is capped at the Seller's forecasted Incremental Cost
            plus 33.78(cent)/kW/day. The total demand charge revenues in any
            consecutive seven-day period shall not exceed the product of the
            weekly rate and the

            highest demand experienced on any day in the seven-day period. The
            Seller's forecasted Incremental Cost discussed above also may
            include any transmission and/or ancillary service costs associated
            with the sale, including the cost of any transmission and/or
            ancillary services that the Seller must take on its own system. Any
            such transmission and/or ancillary service charges shall be
            separately identified by the Seller to the Purchaser. The
            transmission and ancillary service rate ceilings shall be available
            through the WSPP's Hub or homepage.

      B-3.7 Start-up costs and no-load costs if included by the Seller shall be
            stated separately in the price.

      B-3.8 Energy schedules for the Purchaser's share of a unit may be modified
            by the Purchaser with not less than a thirty (30) minute notice
            before the hour in which the change is to take place, unless
            otherwise mutually agreed or unforeseen system operating conditions
            occur.

      B-3.9 Unit Commitment Service is intended to have assured availability;
            however, scheduled energy deliveries may be interrupted or curtailed
            as follows:

            (a)   By the Seller by giving proper recall notice to the Purchaser
                  if the Seller and the Purchaser have mutually agreed to recall
                  provisions,

            (b)   By the Seller when all or a portion of the output of the

             one year no later than 30 days after service begins if that Party

C-1   PARTIES:

      This Service Schedule is agreed upon as a part of this Agreement by the
      Parties.

C-2   PURPOSE:

      The purpose of this Service Schedule is to define additional specific
      procedures, terms, and conditions for requesting and providing Firm
      Capacity/Energy Sale or Exchange Service.

C-3   TERMS:

      C-3.1 A Party may schedule Firm Capacity/Energy Sale or Exchange Service
            from another Party by mutual agreement; provided, however, that each
            Party shall be the sole judge as to the extent to and the conditions
            under which it is willing to provide or receive such service
            hereunder consistent with statutory requirements and contractual
            commitments including the Agreement and any applicable Confirmation
            Agreement. Once an agreement is reached, then the obligation for

      C-3.4 Firm energy transactions shall include buying, selling, or
            exchanging firm energy between Parties. Subject to mutual agreement,

            specified time period.

      C-3.5 Purchaser shall arrange purchases directly with Sellers.

                  rates; or

            (2)   where the Seller is not a FERC regulated public utility.

            A Party is a FERC regulated public utility if it is a "public
            utility" as defined in Section 201(e) of the Federal Power Act, 16
            U.S.C. Section 824(e).

      C-3.7 Except as provided for in Section C-3.6, the price shall not exceed

            transmission and/or ancillary services that the Seller must take on
            its own system. Any such transmission and/or ancillary service

            transmission service) by Seller shall be provided pursuant to any
            applicable transmission tariff or agreement, and the rates therefore
            shall be consistent with such tariff or agreement.

            10 of this Agreement; or (c) where applicable, to meet Seller's
            public utility or statutory obligations to its customers. If service
            under this Service Schedule is interrupted under Section C-3.8(a) or
            (b), neither Seller nor Purchaser shall be obligated to pay any
            damages under this Agreement or Confirmation Agreement. If service
            under this Service Schedule is interrupted for any reason
