         FOR VALUE RECEIVED, HEALTH PARK HOUSING LIMITED PARTNERSHIP, a Maryland

         Interest alone shall be payable monthly on the first day of June, 1986

such payments to continue monthly thereafter on the first of each month until
the entire indebtedness has been paid. In any event, the balance of principal
(if any) remaining unpaid, plus accrued interest shall be due and payable on

first to interest at the rate of Nine and Sixty-Five Hundredths Percent (9.65%)
per annum upon the principal sum or so much thereof as shall from time to time
remain unpaid and the balance thereof shall be applied on account of principal.

         If default be made in the payment of any installment under this Note,
and if such default is not made good prior to the due date of the next such
installment, the entire principal sum and accrued interest shall at once become
due and payable without notice, at the option of the holder of this Note.
Failure to exercise this option shall not constitute a waiver of the right to
exercise the same in the event of any subsequent default.

the Loan may not be prepaid in whole or in part prior to June 1, 2000. On or
