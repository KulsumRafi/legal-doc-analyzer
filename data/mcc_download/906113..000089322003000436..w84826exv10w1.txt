      2.4 Increases in Net Rental Income; Purchase Price Adjustments;
Termination Rights. If as of the Closing Date, the Actual Per Property Net
Rental Income from any Property exceeds the Stipulated Per Property Net Rental
Income from such Property, the Purchase Price for such Property shall be
increased by an amount determined as follows: The Stipulated Per Property Net
Rental Income shall be deducted from the Actual Per Property Net Rental Income
for such Property, the difference shall be multiplied by the Occupancy Factor
and the resulting number shall be divided by the Cap Rate. The amount so
determined shall then be added to the Purchase Price for such Property. If at
any time on or prior to the Closing Date, the difference between the Stipulated
Per Property Net Rental Income and the Actual Per Property Net Rental Income is
more than five percent (5%) of the Stipulated Per Property Net Rental Income,
Purchaser may, subject to the Termination Limitation, at its option, upon notice
to Sellers and Escrow Agent, given upon the earlier of (a) the Closing Date or
(b) five (5) business days after Purchaser is advised by Sellers in writing of
the Actual Per Property Net Rental Income for that Property, terminate this

Agreement as to a Property, the Purchase Price shall be reduced by an amount
equal to the Allocable Purchase Price for such Property as shown on Exhibit C.
In the event the time period for giving notice of termination as set forth above
shall expire without Purchaser giving such notice, except as otherwise provided
below in this Section 2.4, Purchaser shall no longer have the right to terminate
under this Section 2.4 with respect to the affected Property. If there is a
subsequent change in the Actual Per Property Rental Income from such Property or
there is a change in the Actual Per Property Rental Income from any of the other
Properties, the provisions of this Section 2.4 shall again be operative. If the
Termination Limitation prohibits Purchaser from terminating this Agreement with
respect to a Property under this Section 2.4, Purchaser shall have the right to
terminate this Agreement under this Section 2.4 with respect to all Properties
whereupon the Deposit shall be returned to Purchaser and neither party shall
have any further liability hereunder.

            (a) If at any time on or prior to the Closing Date, the Actual Per
Property Net Rental Income from any Property is less than the Stipulated Per
Property Net Rental Income from such Property by more than five percent (5%) of
the Stipulated Per Property Net Rental Income, Purchaser may, subject to the
Termination Limitation, at its option, upon notice to Sellers and Escrow Agent,
given upon the earlier of (i) the Closing Date or (ii) five (5) business days
after Purchaser is advised by Sellers in writing of the Actual Per Property Net
Rental Income for that Property, terminate this Agreement with respect to such
Property. Time shall be of the essence with respect to the giving of such
notice. In the event Purchaser elects to terminate this Agreement with respect
to a Property, the Purchase Price shall be reduced by an amount equal to the
Allocable Purchase Price for such Property as shown on Exhibit C. In the event
the time period for giving notice of termination as set forth above shall expire
without Purchaser giving such notice, except as otherwise provided below in this
Section 2.5(a), Purchaser shall no longer have the right to terminate under this
Section 2.5(a) with respect to the affected Property, and there shall be no
adjustment or reduction to the Purchase Price. If there is a subsequent change
in the Actual Per Property Rental Income from such Property or there is a change
in the Actual Per Property Rental Income from any of the other Properties, the
provisions of this Section 2.5(a) shall again be operative. If the Termination
Limitation prohibits Purchaser from terminating this Agreement with respect to a
Property under this Section 2.5(a), Purchaser shall have the right to terminate
this Agreement under this Section 2.5(a) with respect to all Properties,
whereupon the Deposit shall be returned to Purchaser and neither party shall
have any further liability hereunder. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in Section 2.4 or Section 2.5(a), Purchaser shall not have the right
to terminate this Agreement solely with respect to the Property commonly known
as 1200 Valley Brook Road, Lyndhurst, New Jersey, and there shall be no escrows
or adjustments to the Allocable Purchase Price for such Property, provided that
if this Agreement is terminated with respect to all other Properties, this
Agreement shall terminate with respect to such Property.

            (b) If as of the Closing Date, there is a modification to any of the
Leases specified on Exhibit B or

\
a non-Qualifying New Lease is executed, and the rental income which such tenant
is obligated to pay under such Lease is less than the Stipulated Per Property
Net Rental Income specified on Exhibit D for the unexpired current term for such
lease as shown on Exhibit E, then, provided Purchaser does not exercise its
termination right under Section 2.5(a), if applicable, the Purchase Price for
the Property subject to any such Lease shall be decreased by an amount equal to
the present value of the difference between (i) each installment of Net Rental
Income payable under each such Lease specified on Exhibit D during the unexpired
current term of such Lease (or, if applicable, the replaced Lease) as specified
on Exhibit E and (ii) each installment of actual Net Rental Income payable under
such lease as modified for the unexpired current term of the Lease, discounted
to present value at the rate of 9.5% per annum from the date each such
installment of rental income would be due and payable to the Closing Date.
Nothing contained herein shall be deemed a consent by Purchaser to the execution
of any non-Qualifying New Lease, nor, subject to the Termination Limitation,
constitute a waiver by Purchaser of the right to terminate this Agreement as to
any or all of the Properties in the event a non-Qualifying New Lease is executed
without the prior written consent of Purchaser. In the event a non-Qualifying

of the Lease as shown on Exhibit E was to expire less than five (5) years after
the Closing Date, in which event the amount to be escrowed under this clause
(iv) shall be prorated by multiplying such sum by a fraction, the numerator of

first day of the month immediately succeeding the Closing Date and continuing on
the first day of each succeeding month for a total period of twelve (12)
consecutive months, to draw from such escrow account a sum equal to one-twelfth

(i) and (ii), until the first of the following to occur: (y) such time as
Purchaser leases the space at the Property which was subject to such terminated
Lease and the tenant thereunder takes occupancy or commences to pay rent, or (z)

representing a tenant improvement allowance equal to $10.00 per square foot,
adjusted as provided in Section 7.7, less any monies then paid to contractors
for the tenant improvements completed in accordance with the Qualifying New
Lease, provided duly executed lien waivers are delivered to Purchaser, and (iv)
unless Seller can demonstrate to the reasonable satisfaction of Purchaser that
there is no commission payable in connection with the Qualifying New Lease or

the extent the commission has not been paid. Purchaser shall have the right,
commencing on the corresponding day of the month immediately succeeding the

applicable Seller funds deposited pursuant to escrow category (iv) above. The
amount to be released to Purchaser in any month under escrow categories (i) and
(ii) shall be reduced by the amount of any rent received by Purchaser with
respect to the GMR Space for the period from the Closing Date to the first
anniversary of the Closing Date. In the event there is not a Qualifying New

                                       21

                        certifying the basis for such termination, or (y) a
                        Seller has defaulted in performance of its obligations
                        under this Agreement and the facts and circumstances
                        underlying such default; provided, however, that, except
                        in the case of a termination by Purchaser pursuant to
                        Section 4.1, Escrow Agent shall not honor such demand
                        until at least ten (10) days after it has sent a copy of
                        such demand to Sellers, nor thereafter if Escrow Agent
                        shall have received written notice of objection from
                        Sellers in accordance with the provisions of clause (b)
                        of this Section 2.8. In the event of a termination by

            the five (5) days after Escrow Agent delivers a copy of the written
            demand to the objecting party but not thereafter. Such notice shall
            set forth the basis for objecting to the delivery of the Deposit.
            Upon receipt of such notice, Escrow Agent shall promptly send a copy
            thereof to the party who made the written demand.

            (c) In the event of any dispute between the parties regarding the
            Deposit, Escrow Agent, at its option, may disregard all instructions
            received and either (i) hold the Deposit until the dispute is
            mutually resolved and Escrow Agent is advised of this fact in
            writing by both Seller and Purchaser, or Escrow Agent is otherwise
            instructed by a final unappealable judgment of a court of competent
            jurisdiction, or (ii) deposit the Deposit with a court of competent
            jurisdiction (whereupon Escrow Agent shall be released and relieved
            of any and all


                                       24

            liability and obligations hereunder from and after the date of such
            deposit).

            (d) In the event Escrow Agent shall be uncertain as to its duties or
            rights hereunder or shall receive conflicting instructions, claims
            or demands from the parties hereto, or instructions which conflict
            with any of the provisions of this Agreement, Escrow Agent shall be
            entitled (but not obligated) to refrain from taking any action other
            than to keep safely the Deposit until Escrow Agent shall be
            instructed otherwise in writing signed by both Sellers and
            Purchaser, or by final judgment of a court of competent
            jurisdiction.

            (e) Escrow Agent may rely upon, and shall be protected in acting or
            refraining from acting upon, any written notice, instruction or
            request furnished to it hereunder and believed by it to be genuine
            and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties,
            provided that any modification of this Agreement shall be signed by
            Escrow Agent, Purchaser and Sellers.

            (f) Sellers and Purchaser shall jointly and severally hold Escrow
            Agent harmless against any loss, damage, liability or expense
            incurred by Escrow Agent not caused by its willful misconduct or
            gross negligence, arising out of or in connection with its entering
            into this Agreement and the carrying out of its duties hereunder,
            including the reasonable costs and expenses of defending itself
            against any claim of liability or participating in any legal
            proceeding. Escrow Agent may consult with counsel of its choice, and
            shall have full and complete authorization and protection for any
            action taken or suffered by it hereunder in good faith and in
            accordance with the opinion of such counsel.

            (g) Sellers and Purchaser shall share equally the responsibility for
            reimbursement to Escrow Agent of all out-of-pocket expenses,
            disbursements and advances (including reasonable attorneys' fees)
            incurred or made by Escrow

            Agent in connection with the carrying out of its duties hereunder.

            terminate and Escrow Agent shall be discharged from further duties
            and obligations hereunder upon final payment of the Deposit in

                                    ARTICLE 3

                               TITLE TO PROPERTIES

      3.1 Title to Lands and Improvements. Title to the Lands and Improvements
shall be good, marketable and insurable at regular rates by the Title Insurer,
subject to (a) the exceptions listed on Exhibit H annexed hereto, (b) the Leases
and (c) any exceptions to which Purchaser does not object pursuant to Section
3.3 (the "Permitted Exceptions").

      3.2 Title to Other Property. Title to the Personal Property and all other
property intended to be conveyed or assigned hereunder to Purchaser shall be
good and valid, subject to no encumbrances or security interests.

      3.3 Title Defects. Purchaser shall furnish to Sellers within thirty (30)
calendar days from the date hereof a copy of title commitments with respect to
the Properties prepared by the Title Insurer and a copy of any other searches
conducted with respect to the Properties, together with a statement specifying
any objections to title or survey matters ("Title Objection"). Sellers shall
cure any Voluntary Encumbrance prior to the Closing Date, provided Sellers shall
not be obligated to expend more than the net Allocable Purchase Price (after
closing adjustments) to remove any Voluntary Encumbrance from the affected
Property. If Sellers do not agree to remove any Title Objection (excluding a
Voluntary Encumbrance) within ten (10) days after receipt of notice of the Title
Objection, Purchaser shall have the option, to be exercised within five (5)
business days after receipt of such notice from Sellers, to either (a) waive the
Title Objection which is not removed and close title without abatement or
reduction of the Purchase Price or (b) terminate this Agreement, whereupon, the
Deposit shall be returned to Purchaser, and upon such return, this Agreement and
all rights and obligations of the respective


                                       26
<PAGE>

parties hereunder shall be null and void. The failure or refusal of Sellers to
remove a Voluntary Encumbrance to the extent provided above, shall constitute a
default hereunder.

      3.4 Right to Pay Off Monetary Encumbrances. Sellers shall have the right
to pay off any monetary encumbrances against the Properties on the Closing Date
out of the cash then payable provided recordable instruments of release or
discharge of such encumbrances in form and substance satisfactory to counsel for
Purchaser and the Title Insurer are then delivered to Purchaser.

      3.5 Integrated Transaction. This is an integrated transaction and, except
as expressly provided herein, Sellers shall not be required to sell and convey,
and Purchaser shall not be required to close title, to less than all of the
Properties.

                                    ARTICLE 4

                               TERMINATION RIGHTS

      4.1 Due Diligence Period; Termination. Purchaser shall have the right,
during the Due Diligence Period, to inspect the Properties and to investigate
existing zoning, the Leases, the physical and environmental condition of the
Properties, the adequacy of existing utilities, the plans and specifications for
the Improvements, surveys, appraisals, service contracts, real estate taxes,
economic feasibility and any other factors Purchaser deems relevant in
determining whether to purchase the Properties. If for any or no reason
Purchaser is not satisfied with the results of its investigations, Purchaser may
terminate this Agreement on notice to Sellers and Escrow Agent given within the
Due Diligence Period, the time for giving such notice being of the essence. In
the event of such termination, the Deposit shall be returned to Purchaser,
whereupon this Agreement and all rights and obligations of the respective
parties hereunder shall be null and void. If Purchaser does not elect to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 4.1 within the Due Diligence
Period, Purchaser shall conclusively be deemed to have waived its right of
termination under this Section 4.1.

      4.2 Right of Entry. Purchaser and its agents, employees and consultants
shall, subject to the rights of the Mortgagee and existing tenants, have access
to the Lands and


                                       27
<PAGE>

Improvements from time to time, upon reasonable notice, prior to the Closing
Date for the purpose of inspecting the Properties and undertaking tests and
studies thereof, provided (a) Purchaser promptly repairs any damage caused by
such entry, (b) Purchaser restores the Properties to the condition that existed
prior to such entry and (c) Purchaser does not unreasonably interfere with the
rights of existing tenants. Purchaser shall hold and save each Seller harmless
from and against any and all loss, cost, damage, injury or expense arising out
of the activities of Purchaser, its agents, employees and consultants, relating
to any such entry, provided that Purchaser shall not be liable for (a) the
discovery of any preexisting condition, (b) any claims of diminution in the
value of any Property as a consequence of the results revealed by any such
investigations or testing or (c) the acts of Sellers or their agents or
representatives. Prior to conducting any intrusive testing on any Property,
Purchaser shall furnish to the Seller owing such Property evidence that
Purchaser has procured comprehensive general liability insurance from an insurer
authorized to do business in the State of New Jersey, which is reasonably
acceptable to such Seller, insuring such Seller against claims for bodily
injury, death or damage to property in single limit amount of not less than
$2,000,000, naming such Seller as an additional insured. The indemnification
provision contained in this Section 4.2 shall survive the termination of this
Agreement and the closing of title.

      4.3 Availability of Documents and Inquiries. Sellers represent and warrant
that, prior to the date of this Agreement, Sellers have furnished to Purchaser
copies of the title policies insuring the priority of the mortgage held by the
Mortgagee, copies of existing surveys in their possession, copies of the Leases
and copies of the most current environmental reports in their possession for
each Property. Seller will permit Purchaser to review and copy tenant files and
operating expense information, and to the extent in the possession of Sellers,
plans and specifications (including as built plans and shop drawings),
certificates of occupancy, engineering data and reports and soils investigation
reports. Sellers shall also promptly respond to any inquiries of Purchaser with
respect to the ownership, operation, maintenance or repair of the Properties.
Purchaser, personally or through its authorized representatives or agents, shall
be entitled to interview tenants.


                                       28
<PAGE>

      4.4 Audits. Purchaser shall also have the right at any time prior to the
Closing Date, at Purchaser's expense, to have independent accountants selected
by Purchaser prepare audited financial statements with respect to any or all of
the Properties from any books and records that are in the possession of Sellers.
Each Seller agrees to cooperate in the conduct of any such audit, to make its
books and records available and to furnish to such accounting firm with such
information as is customarily provided in connection with similar audits.

      4.5 Termination of Contracts. Effective as of the Closing Date, Sellers
shall terminate all Contracts and all exclusive listing agreements at no cost to
Purchaser.

      4.6 Brokerage Obligations. On the Closing Date, Purchaser shall assume the
obligations of the applicable Sellers under the Brokerage Commission Agreements
identified on Exhibit YY annexed hereto, but only to the extent of commissions
that become due and payable thereunder as a result of the exercise by the
applicable tenant of an extension or expansion right after the Closing Date.
Sellers have advised Purchaser that the brokers identified on Exhibit YY annexed
hereto may be entitled to commissions in connection with the tenancies
identified on Exhibit YY, but that there are no written agreements with any such
brokers. Purchaser agrees to pay a broker listed on Exhibit YY a commission upon
the exercise by any applicable tenant of an extension or expansion right after
the Closing Date but only to the extent such obligation is stated on Exhibit YY.

      4.7 Confidential Information. Prior to the closing, Purchaser shall use
the Confidential Information only for purposes of evaluating the Properties in
connection with its potential purchase thereof (and if this transaction closes,
in connection with the ownership and operation of the Properties).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser may disclose the Confidential
Information to legal counsel, accountants, lenders, potential investors,
regulatory authorities and consultants and Purchaser may disclose the
Confidential Information to the extent that such disclosure is required by law
or court order or by discovery rules in any legal proceeding, provided Purchaser
gives Sellers prior notice thereof. If this Agreement is terminated by Purchaser


                                       29
<PAGE>

prior to closing, Purchaser shall return the Confidential Information to
Sellers.

THERETO. PURCHASER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT AS OF THE EXPIRATION OF THE DUE DILGENCE
PERIOD IT WILL HAVE HAD SUCH ACCESS TO THE PROPERTIES AND SUCH OTHER MATTERS AND
TO INFORMATION AND DATA RELATING TO ALL OF SAME AS PURCHASER HAS CONSIDERED
NECESSARY, PRUDENT, APPROPRIATE OR DESIRABLE FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS


                                       34

TRANSACTION. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, PURCHASER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES
THAT, EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER SELLERS NOR ANY
REPRESENTATIVE OF SELLERS IS LIABLE OR RESPONSIBLE FOR OR BOUND IN ANY MANNER BY
(AND PURCHASER HAS NOT RELIED UPON) ANY VERBAL OR WRITTEN OR SUPPLIED
REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, COVENANTS, AGREEMENTS, OBLIGATIONS, GUARANTEES,
STATEMENTS OR INFORMATION PERTAINING TO THE PROPERTIES. PURCHASER ACKNOWLEDGES
AND AGREES THAT, EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT, PURCHASER IS
PURCHASING THE PROPERTIES, "AS IS" AT THE DATE HEREOF, SUBJECT TO ANY REASONABLE
WEAR AND TEAR BETWEEN THE DATE HEREOF AND THE CLOSING DATE

      5.4 Survival of Seller's Representations and Warranties. The
representations and warranties contained in Section 5.1 are true, accurate and
complete and not misleading in any material respect as of the date hereof and
shall be deemed to be repeated at and as of the Closing Date, and shall be true,
accurate and complete and not misleading in any material respect as of such
date, subject, in each such case, to the discovery of any inaccuracy not caused
by the willful action of Sellers arising from any events occurring subsequent to
the date hereof. The representations and warranties in Section 5.1 shall survive
the closing for a period of one (1) year from the Closing Date.

      5.5 Changes to Representations and Warranties. If prior to the closing,
Sellers obtain actual knowledge that any representation or warranty of Sellers
becomes inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect, Sellers shall promptly
give Purchaser notice thereof, describing such inaccuracy and the circumstances
causing such inaccuracy. If Sellers do not cure such inaccuracy within ten (10)
calendar days, Purchaser shall have the right, at its option, to terminate this
Agreement with respect to the affected Property or, subject to the Termination
Limitation, terminate this Agreement with respect to all Properties, within ten
(10) days after receipt of such notice. If the termination is only with respect
to the affected Property, the Purchase Price shall be reduced by an amount equal
to the Allocable Purchase Price for such Property. If such termination is with
respect to all Properties, the Deposit shall be refunded to Purchaser, whereupon
neither Sellers nor Purchaser shall have any further rights against the other
hereunder. If Purchaser fails to give notice of a termination within such
period, unless the inaccuracy was caused by the willful action of Sellers or was
inaccurate as of the date hereof, Purchaser


                                       35
<PAGE>

shall conclusively be deemed to have waived its right to terminate this
Agreement as a result thereof. If such inaccuracy was caused by the willful
action of Sellers or such representation or warranty was inaccurate as of the
date hereof, Purchaser shall not be deemed to waive its termination right or any
other rights under this Agreement. If, however, Purchaser proceeds to close with
knowledge of such inaccuracy, then Purchaser shall be deemed to have waived same
and shall have no claim on account thereof against Sellers.

      5.6 Inaccuracies Discovered by Purchaser. If prior to the closing,
Purchaser shall independently learn of any material inaccuracy in any of the
representations or warranties of Sellers, and with actual knowledge of such
inaccuracy elects to consummate the closing, the Purchaser shall be deemed to
have waived the same and shall have no claim on account thereof against Sellers.

create, suffer or permit to be created, and that they will promptly remove or
discharge, any liens or encumbrances against any of the Properties arising

Sellers further agree that, except as provided in Section 7.5, they will not
enter into any contracts or agreements relating to any of the Properties prior

Properties have heretofore been operated and will use commercially reasonable
efforts to maintain in effect any Guarantees and Warranties. Sellers will cure

maintenance or service contracts which would become the obligation of Purchaser;
and will promptly


                                       37
<PAGE>

inform Purchaser in writing upon obtaining actual knowledge of any material
event adversely affecting the ownership, use, occupancy, operation or
maintenance of the Properties, whether or not insured against.

      7.3 Insurance. Sellers will cause their existing fire, extended coverage
and public liability insurance covering the Properties to be maintained in full
force and effect as heretofore maintained by it.

      7.4 Performance of Obligations. Sellers will promptly (a) comply with all
obligations of the landlord under the Leases, the Reciprocal Easement Agreements
and the Guarantees and Warranties and (b) promptly upon obtaining knowledge
thereof, notify Purchaser of any default by Seller or any tenant under any of
the Leases or by Sellers under any of the Reciprocal Easement Agreements
Guarantees and Warranties.

      7.5 Leasing. After the date hereof, Sellers will not, without the prior
consent of Purchaser, which such consent may be denied by Purchaser for any
reason, enter into (or propose to Mortgagee that Mortgagee enter into) any Lease
Transaction, except that, without Purchaser's consent, Sellers may (a) enter
into (or propose to Mortgagee that Mortgagee enter into) Qualifying New Leases
within ten (10) calendar days after transmitting to Purchaser a Lease Proposal
Notice, provided that Sellers will not enter into (or propose to Mortgagee that

proposed transaction does not, in Purchaser's reasonable judgment, satisfy the
criteria for qualifying as a Qualifying New Lease and (b) renew or extend
existing Leases, or permit any existing tenant to lease additional space
pursuant to the exercise by a tenant of a renewal, extension or expansion option
presently contained in any such Lease. Sellers will promptly furnish to
Purchaser a copy of any document evidencing a transaction described in clause

specify the reasons therefor. Sellers shall promptly advise Purchaser of any

      7.6 No Marketing. Sellers shall not, directly or indirectly, market any of
the Properties for sale, exchange or other disposition to any third party.

      7.7 Obligations for Brokerage and Tenant Fit-Up. Seller will not enter
into any brokerage agreement with respect to any Qualifying New Lease that
requires the payment of a commission in excess of five percent (5%) of the gross
rent payable under such lease unless, on the Closing Date, the applicable Seller
deposits into the escrow for brokerage commissions required to be established
under Section 2.6, an amount equal to the excess. Sellers shall also pay when
due all costs and expenses for tenant fit-up work, allowances, moving expenses
and other monetary inducements granted to any tenant under any Qualifying New
Lease, provided that after the Closing Date, payments to contractors for tenant
fit-up work performed pursuant to Qualifying New Leases shall be funded in
accordance with the escrow provisions of Article 2. Sellers will not enter into
any construction contract for tenant fit-up, or grant any tenant any allowance,
moving expense reimbursement or other monetary inducement in connection with a
Qualifying New Lease if the cost of the work exceeds the applicable amount to be
escrowed therefor pursuant to Article 2 unless, on the Closing Date, the
applicable Seller deposits into the escrow for tenant improvement work required
to be established under Section 2.6(b), an amount equal to such excess. If
Sellers fail or refuse to comply with the provisions of this Section 7.7,
Purchaser shall have the right to draw from the escrow accounts amounts
sufficient to cure such defaults. Purchaser shall have the right to approve all
contractors and the terms and conditions of all construction contracts relating
to any tenant fit-up work pursuant to a Qualifying New Lease, which such consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. Purchaser hereby
approves the contractors identified on Exhibit U annexed hereto.

      7.8. Rights of First Refusal. Within three (3) business days after
Purchaser pays the amount required to be paid pursuant to clause (a) of Section
2.7, Sellers shall send to any party having a right of first refusal or first
offer to purchase a Property or any portion thereof an effective notice
triggering such right of first refusal or first offer, the form of such notice
to be substantially as set forth on Exhibit CC hereto. Sellers will notify
Purchaser promptly upon obtaining any response from such


                                       39
<PAGE>

party, and will also promptly notify Purchaser if such party has failed to
respond within the period specified in the right of first refusal or first
offer. If any such tenant validly exercises its right of first refusal, this
Agreement shall terminate with respect to such Property and the Purchase Price
shall be reduced by the Allocable Purchase Price for such Property, provided
that if the tenant exercising such right thereafter waives its right of first
refusal, defaults thereunder or otherwise forfeits its right to acquire the
Property, such Property shall again become subject to this Agreement and the
Purchase Price shall be increased by an amount equal to the Allocable Purchase
Price for such Property.

                                    ARTICLE 8

                      DAMAGE, DESTRUCTION AND CONDEMNATION

      8.1 Casualty. The risk of loss or damage to the Properties by fire or
other casualty before the delivery of the deed hereunder is assumed by the
Seller owning each such Property. In the event of any damage to or destruction
of a Property due to fire or any other cause or hazard, Sellers shall promptly
give notice thereof to Purchaser describing such damage and indicating the
estimated cost and period required for Restoration. If the cost of Restoration
as estimated by Purchaser in good faith is in excess of $500,000, or as a result
of such damage or destruction a tenant is permitted to cancel its Lease, then
Purchaser, upon notice to Sellers given within ten (10) days after receipt of
notice of such occurrence, may, subject to the Termination Limitation, at its
option, terminate this Agreement with respect to such Property or terminate this
Agreement with respect to all Properties. If the termination is only with
respect to the Property that has been damaged or destroyed, the Purchase Price
shall be reduced by an amount equal to the Allocable Purchase Price for such
Property. If such termination is with respect to all Properties, the Deposit
shall be refunded to Purchaser, whereupon neither Sellers nor Purchaser shall
have any further rights against the other hereunder. In the event that the cost
of Restoration is less than $500,000 as determined by any of the architects or
contractors set forth on Exhibit ZZ hereto or such other party approved by
Sellers and Purchaser, or if in excess thereof and Purchaser does not elect to
terminate this Agreement, Purchaser shall be entitled to a credit on the Closing
Date against the Allocable Purchase Price for such


                                       40
<PAGE>

Property in an amount equal to the cost of Restoration.

      8.2 Condemnation. In the event any proceedings or negotiations are
instituted which do or may result in a taking by condemnation or eminent domain
of any of the Properties or any portion thereof, Sellers shall promptly notify
Purchaser thereof, describing the nature and extent thereof. Purchaser may,
subject to the Termination Limitation, within ten (10) days after receipt of
such notice, at its option, terminate this Agreement with respect to such
Property or terminate this Agreement with respect to all Properties. If the
termination is only with respect to the Property that has or may be taken, the
Purchase Price shall be reduced by an amount equal to the Allocable Purchase
Price for such Property. If such termination is with respect to all Properties,
the Deposit shall be refunded to Purchaser, whereupon neither Sellers nor
Purchaser shall have any further rights against the other hereunder. In the
event Purchaser does not terminate this Agreement, the sale of the Properties
shall be consummated as herein provided and the Seller whose Property is or may
be taken shall assign to Purchaser on the Closing Date all of its right, title
and interest in and to all awards payable by reason thereof and shall pay over
to Purchaser all amounts theretofore received by such Seller or Mortgagee in
connection with such taking. Sellers agree not to settle or compromise any claim
for such award without the prior written consent of Purchaser. Purchaser shall
have the right, at its cost, to participate in any condemnation proceeding,
unless Purchaser terminates this Agreement with respect to such Property.

      8.3 Hazardous Substances. In the event that after Purchaser completes its
environmental audit of a Property and prior to the Closing Date there is a
spill, discharge, release, deposit or emplacement of any Hazardous Substance on
any of the Properties which results in contamination of such Property beyond
permitted governmental tolerances, Sellers shall, promptly upon obtaining
knowledge thereof, notify Purchaser of such event, describing the nature and
extent thereof. Purchaser may, within fifteen (15) days after receipt of such
notice, subject to the Termination Limitation, at its option, terminate this
Agreement with respect to such Property or terminate this Agreement with respect
to all Properties. If the termination is only with respect to the Property that
has been contaminated, the Purchase Price shall be reduced by an amount equal to
the Allocable Purchase Price for such Property. If such


                                       41
<PAGE>

termination is with respect to all Properties, the Deposit shall be refunded to
Purchaser, whereupon neither Sellers not Purchaser shall have any further rights
against the other hereunder. If Purchaser does not so terminate this Agreement,
Purchaser shall be entitled to a credit against the Allocable Purchase Price for
the affected Property in an amount equal to the cost to remediate the Property,
as estimated in good faith by Purchaser, provided that in no event shall such
credit exceed $500,000. Upon receipt of such credit, the applicable Seller shall
have no liability or responsibility for such remediation of such contamination.

            (d) evidence shall have been delivered satisfactory to the Title
            Insurer that Advertising Display Corporation and Lensclean, Inc.
            have effectively waived their respective rights of first refusal
            contained in their Leases.

            approved by Purchaser for fit-up work required under any Qualifying
            New Lease;

            (d) Forms 1099; and

            (e) statements relating to each Property showing all closing
            prorations.

      9.7 Certificates of Occupancy etc. If any applicable Legal Requirement
requires that a new certificate of occupancy, continued certificate of
occupancy, site plan approval, smoke detector inspection or any other government
approval is required as a condition to the conveyance of any of the Properties,
the Seller owning such Property or Properties, at its sole cost and expense,
shall comply with such requirement and deliver to Purchaser evidence of such
compliance on the Closing Date.

                               CLOSING ADJUSTMENTS

      10.1 Adjustment Time. All apportionments and adjustments shall be made as
of 12:00 midnight on the Closing Date.

      10.2 Description of Items to be Adjusted. The following apportionments and
adjustments shall be made:

            (a) real estate taxes assessed against the Lands and Improvements
            based upon the calendar year assessed;

            (b) the amount of the real estate transfer taxes payable in
            connection with the conveyance of each of the Properties shall be
            deducted from the Allocable Purchase Price and shall be paid by
            Purchaser directly to the taxing authority;

            (c) if there are any confirmed or unconfirmed special assessments
            against the Lands or the Improvements, the Seller owning such
            Property shall pay same if the work giving rise to the assessment
            was completed prior to the date of


                                       47
<PAGE>

            this Agreement, but if the work giving rise to the assessment was
            not completed prior to the date of this Agreement, same shall be
            paid or assumed by Purchaser;

            (d) rents and all other charges (including cost reimbursement
            payments) actually paid under the Leases, provided, however, that,
            if any rents shall be accrued and unpaid at the Closing Date, the
            rents collected by Purchaser on or after the Closing Date shall
            first be applied to all rents due at the time of such collection on
            or after the Closing Date with the balance payable to the applicable
            Seller to the extent of rents delinquent as of the Closing Date;
            provided, further, that Purchaser shall not be required to institute
            any proceeding to collect any rents accrued and unpaid on the
            Closing Date. Any rent or additional rent paid to any Seller after
            the Closing Date shall promptly be remitted to Purchaser. If a
            Seller shall not have received all accrued and unpaid rents due it
            as of the Closing Date within one hundred twenty (120) days
            thereafter, such Seller, at its sole cost and expense, shall be
            entitled to bring such actions or proceedings not affecting
            possession, the validity of the related Lease or any security held
            by Purchaser thereunder as it shall desire to collect any such
            accrued and unpaid rents, and Purchaser shall, at no cost to
            Purchaser, cooperate with such Seller in any such action;

            (e) payments under any Reciprocal Easement Agreement;

            (f) all other income and expense from the Properties of every type
            and nature. If any of the foregoing cannot be apportioned at the
            Closing Date because of the unavailability of the amounts which are
            to be apportioned, such items shall be apportioned as soon as
            practicable after the Closing Date; and

            (g) sewer, water, gas, electric, telephone and other utility charges
            shall not be apportioned but shall be paid by Sellers based upon
            current bills or meter readings.


                                       48

      10.3 Security Deposits. At closing, Purchaser shall be entitled to a
credit against the Allocable Purchase Price for all security deposits (including
any interest thereon to which a tenant may be entitled) held by any Seller
pursuant to the Leases or such Seller shall turn over such security deposits and
interest to Purchaser.

      10.4 Closing Costs. Sellers and Purchaser shall pay their own legal fees
related to this transaction. Purchaser shall pay all its costs associated with
its due diligence investigation of the Properties, the cost of title searches
and surveys, title insurance premiums and the cost of recording the deeds.
Sellers shall pay the cost of curing any Title Objections, removing any
Voluntary Encumbrances and all transfer taxes.

                                DEFAULT; REMEDIES

      11.1 Default by Purchaser. Sellers may terminate this Agreement by notice
to Purchaser at any time prior to the Closing Date in the event of (a) a default
by Purchaser under this Agreement (which remains uncured for ten (10) days after
notice to Purchaser specifying such default and demanding that same be cured or
(b) a material breach by Purchaser of any representation or warranty expressly
set forth in this Agreement (a "Purchaser Default").

      11.2 Default by Seller. Purchaser may terminate this Agreement by notice
to Seller at any time prior to the Closing Date in the event of (a) a default by
any Seller under this Agreement (which remains uncured for ten (10) days after
notice to Sellers specifying such default and demanding that same be cured,
unless such default cannot be cured by the payment of money and cannot with due
diligence be wholly cured within such ten (10) day period, in which case Sellers
may request a longer period as shall be necessary to cure such default, so long
as Sellers proceed promptly to cure such default within such ten (10) day
period, prosecute such cure to completion with due diligence within sixty (60)
days and advise Purchaser of the actions which Sellers are taking and the
progress being made) or (b) a material breach by any Seller of any
representation or warranty expressly set forth in this Agreement that is not
cured within the applicable grace period (a "Seller Default").

      11.3 Remedies.

            (a) Of Sellers. In the event of a Purchaser Default, Sellers shall,
            as their sole and exclusive remedy hereunder, have the right to
            terminate this Agreement and receive the Deposit and such payment
            shall constitute and be liquidated and agreed damages, whereupon the
            parties hereto shall be relieved of any further liability or
            obligation to each other, it being expressly understood that the
            receipt by Sellers of such monies shall be the sole and exclusive
            right and remedy of Sellers and constitutes a fair and reasonable
            amount for the damage sustained by Sellers by reason of Purchaser's
            breach of this Agreement. Sellers hereby waive and release any right
            to seek specific performance against Purchaser.

            (b) Of Purchaser. In the event of a Seller Default, Purchaser shall
            be entitled, either (i) to specific performance, or (ii) to
            terminate this Agreement and receive from Sellers the Deposit or
            (iii) to waive the Seller Default and consummate the transactions
            contemplated hereby, provided that if any Seller willfully causes a
            Seller Default or sells the Properties or any portion thereof to a
            third party, or takes any action that renders the remedy of specific
            performance impossible or impracticable to obtain, Sellers shall be
            liable for any damages sustained by Purchaser.

      11.4 Actions of Mortgagee. Purchaser acknowledges that the Mortgagee has
been authorized by the Court in the Mortgage Foreclosure Proceeding to take
certain actions with respect to the Properties, including certain actions with
respect to the management, operation and leasing of the Properties. Purchaser
agrees that any such action by the Mortgagee shall not be deemed a default by
Sellers under this agreement unless such action was taken at the request of
Sellers. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Mortgagee takes any action which
would otherwise be a default by Sellers hereunder, or would cause any of the
representations and warranties of Sellers to be materially inaccurate, Purchaser
shall have the sole right, at its option, to terminate this


                                       50
<PAGE>

Agreement with respect to the affected Property, subject to the Termination
Limitation, or terminate this Agreement with respect to all Properties, within
ten (10) days after obtaining actual knowledge thereof. If the termination is
only with respect to the affected Property, the Purchase Price shall be reduced
by an amount equal to the Allocable Purchase Price for such Property. If such
termination is with respect to all Properties, the Deposit shall be refunded to
Purchaser, whereupon neither Sellers nor Purchaser shall have any further rights
against the other hereunder. Purchaser also acknowledges that the Mortgagee is
not obligated under the Loan Documents to release or discharge the Properties
from the liens, security interests and assignments created by the Loan Documents
and agrees that, if Mortgagee shall refuse to release or discharge such liens,
security interests and assignments on the Closing Date, Sellers shall not be
deemed to be in default hereunder. Sellers agree to exercise good faith and due
diligence to cause the Mortgagee to grant such releases or discharges, provided
that (a) the proceeds from the sale of the Properties are applied in full by
Mortgagee to the indebtedness evidenced and secured by the Loan Documents and
(b) Sellers are not required to release Mortgagee and its agents, contractors,
employees and other affiliates from any liabilities with respect to any
properties other than the Properties being conveyed to Purchaser under this
Agreement and (c) Seller shall not be required to comply with any other terms or
conditions of Mortgagee which are not acceptable to Seller. Sellers shall advise
Purchaser from time to time of the status of the negotiations with Mortgagee. If
Mortgagee refuses to discharge such liens, security interests and assignments on
the Closing Date on the above terms, and same are not discharged pursuant to an
unappealable judgment or order of a court having jurisdiction over Mortgagee,
Purchaser's sole remedy shall be to terminate this Agreement, whereupon the
Deposit shall be refunded to Purchaser and neither party shall have any further
rights under this Agreement.

                                   ARTICLE 12

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

      12.1 Brokerage Commission and Finder's Fee. Sellers and Purchaser agree
that they have dealt with each other and not through any real estate broker,
investment banker,


                                       51
<PAGE>

person, firm or entity who would, by reason of such dealings, be able to claim a
real estate brokerage, business opportunity brokerage or finder's fee as the
procuring cause of this transaction, except the Broker. Sellers and Purchaser
agree to indemnify the other and hold the other harmless of and from any and all
loss, cost, damage, injury or expense arising out of, or in any way related to,
assertions, by any other person, firm or entity of a claim to real estate
brokerage, business opportunity brokerage or finder's fee based on alleged
contacts between the claiming party and the indemnifying party which have
resulted in allegedly providing a broker or finder with the right to claim such
commission or finder's fee. Purchaser agrees to pay the Broker a commission
pursuant to a separate agreement if, as and when title closes and Sellers shall
have no liability to the Broker. The provisions of this Section 12.1 shall
survive the closing of title. The parties acknowledge that SBWE, Inc. has
advised that it may assert a claim for commissions arising out of this
transaction. Each party denies SBWE, Inc is the procuring cause of this
transaction and that it has any liability to such broker. The parties further
agree that if such claim is asserted, the foregoing provisions relating to
indemnification shall not apply to such claim.

      12.2 Assignment. Purchaser shall have the right to assign this Agreement
to an affiliate provided (a) a copy of the executed assignment is delivered to
Sellers not less that five (5) days prior to the Closing Date, (b) the assignee
assumes all obligations of Purchaser hereunder, and (c) Purchaser remains
primarily liable hereunder as a principal and not as a guarantor or surety.
Purchaser shall also have the right to designate a nominee or nominees to take
title to one or more of the Properties, and in such event all of the benefits of
this Agreement pertaining to such Property shall inure to the benefit of and be
enforceable by such nominee.

      12.3 Notices. Any demand, notice or other communication required or
permitted to be given hereunder shall be in writing, and shall be delivered
personally, by telecopy (with a hard copy and a transmission confirmation sent
by a recognized overnight national courier service (such as Federal Express) for
next business day delivery) or by certified mail, return receipt requested,
first-class postage prepaid to the parties at the addresses set forth below (or

time the notice is delivered to such party. Any notice sent by fax to the
party's designated fax number shall be effective upon receipt, provided receipt
occurs before 5:00 PM on a business day in the State of New Jersey. Confirmation

be conclusive evidence of receipt of such notice. Each party hereby agrees that
it will not refuse or reject delivery of any notice given hereunder, that it
will acknowledge, in writing, receipt of the same upon request by any other
party and that any notice rejected or refused by it shall be deemed for all

date so refused or rejected, as conclusively established by the records of the
U.S. Postal Service or the courier service. Any notice given by an attorney for
a party shall be effective for all purposes.

      12.4 Successors and Assigns. The terms, covenants and conditions herein

      12.6 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by, construed and
enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of New Jersey.

      12.7 Incorporation of Prior Agreements. This Agreement contains the entire
understanding of the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof,
and no prior or other written or oral agreement or undertaking pertaining to any

third party and (e) shall not make Purchaser's obligations hereunder contingent
upon its ability to effectuate such exchange. Purchaser agrees to indemnify and
hold such Seller harmless from and against any additional cost or expense in
