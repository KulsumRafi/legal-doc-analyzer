                                SECOND AMENDMENT

     SECOND AMENDMENT (this "Second Amendment") effective as of January 31,
2003, between Salant Corporation, a Delaware Corporation (the "Corporation") and
William O. Manzer (the "Employee").

     WHEREAS, the Corporation and the Employee entered into to an employment
agreement dated March 13, 2000 and amended pursuant to a letter agreement dated
July 27, 2001 (collectively, the "Employment Agreement");

     WHEREAS, the Corporation and the Employee entered into a letter agreement
relating to a stay bonus and certain other terms of employment dated December 5,
2002 (the "December Letter") which were intended to supplement the terms of the
Employment Agreement;

     WHEREAS, the Corporation and the Employee desire clarify the terms set
forth in the December Letter and incorporate the terms thereof into the
Employment Agreement by entering into this Second Amendment.

     NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the respective premises, mutual
covenants and agreements of the parties hereto, and other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the
parties hereto agree as follows:

Section 1. The Employment Agreement is hereby amended as follows:

     (a)  Section 6(d) is hereby amended to revise Section 6(d)(vi) to read as
          follows:

          "(vi) until the end of the Severance Period, continued participation
          in all medical, dental, health and life insurance plans and in other
          employee benefit plans or programs at the same benefit level at which
          the Employee was participating on the Termination Date, provided that
          if the Employee is precluded from continuing his participation in any
          such benefit plan or program as a matter of law, or in the case of
          life insurance, as a result of the requirements of such benefit plan
          or program, the Corporation shall have no obligation to continue to
          provide such benefits."

     (b)  Section 6(d) is hereby amended to add Sections 6(d)(vii) and
          6(d)(viii) to read as follows:

          "(vii) other or additional benefits then due or earned in accordance
          with applicable plans and programs of the Corporation, payable in a
          lump sum upon the Termination Date to the extent practicable.

          (viii) the Stay Bonus (as hereinafter defined) and Enhanced Severance
          Payment (as hereinafter defined), payable in accordance with Section
          6(h) if such

<PAGE>

          termination occurs on or after a Change of Control, but on or prior to
          the six-month anniversary of the occurrence of the Change of Control."

     (c)  Section 6(e) of the Employment Agreement is deleted and replaced in
          its entirety by the following:

          "(e) Termination by the Employee for Good Reason. The Employee shall
          have the right to terminate his employment for Good Reason (as
          hereinafter defined), provided that the Employee shall have given the
          Corporation ninety (90) days prior written notice of the Employee's
          decision to terminate his employment (specifying the alleged "Good
          Reason" in reasonable detail) and, if it is possible to cure, the
          Corporation shall not have cured the same within thirty (30) thirty
          days after receipt of such notice, or, if cure cannot be fully
          accomplished within thirty (30) days, the Corporation shall not have
          commenced cure within thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice or
          cured the alleged "Good Reason" as soon as possible thereafter.
          Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the event giving rise to "Good
          Reason" is the event described at Section 6(e)(vii), below, the
          Employee shall be entitled to terminate his employment for Good Reason
          immediately upon written notice to the Corporation.

          "Good Reason" shall mean (i) the assignment to the Employee of duties
          materially and adversely inconsistent with the Employee's positions,
          titles, offices, duties, responsibilities or status with the
          Corporation, (ii) a change in the Employee's reporting
          responsibilities; (iii) any removal of the Employee from, or any
          failure to re-elect the Employee to, any positions, titles or offices
          specified in the Employment Agreement and held by the Employee, (iv) a
          reduction in the Employee's Salary, (v) a material reduction in the
          Employee's benefits or perquisites (other than a reduction pursuant to
          the last sentence of Section 3 hereof); (vi) a requirement that
          Employee change his place of principal employment to a location other
          than a location within the metropolitan New York area; or (vii)
          failure of the Corporation (or any successor thereto) to offer the
          Employee continued employment immediately following a Change of
          Control on terms at least as favorable as the New Terms (as defined
          below).

          "New Terms" shall mean terms that are substantially similar to the
          terms of the Employment Agreement, modified to provide that: (1)
          Employee shall be promoted to and have the title of President of the
          Perry Ellis division and the Perry Ellis Brand division of the
          Corporation (or any successor thereto) and shall report directly to
          the Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation (or any successor
          thereto) or the Board of Directors of the Corporation (or its
          successor) if no Chief Executive Officer is named; (2) the Employee
          shall perform such duties as are consistent with the title and
          position of President of the Perry Ellis division and the Perry Ellis
          Brand division, including, without limitation, responsibility for all
          aspects of marketing, merchandising, design and licensing of all Perry
          Ellis products, with further responsibilities subject to negotiations
          with the Corporation (or any successor thereto); (3) the term of
          employment shall be a fixed term of

                                        2

          two (2) years (commencing on the Change of Control), with a
          requirement that the Corporation (or any successor) provide the
          Employee with at least six (6) months notice of any early termination
          of or intention not to extend the employment term, (4) salary shall
          not be less than the Salary immediately in effect prior to the
          occurrence of the Change of Control; (5) benefits shall not be less
          than the benefits in effect immediately prior to the Change of Control
          (including, without limitation, the Employee's Incentive Compensation
          (as set forth in Section 2(b) of the Employment Agreement and Exhibit
          A attached hereto)); (6) that, only in respect of the year in which
          the Change of Control occurs, the Employee shall receive (in lieu of
          the Employee's Incentive Compensation for such year) a guaranteed
          bonus equal to at least fifty percent (50%) of the Employee's
          annualized salary then in effect (the "Guaranteed Bonus") payable no
          later than March 31, 2004; (7) in the event the Employee's employment
          is terminated by the Corporation (or its successor) without Cause or
          by the Employee for Good Reason, a lump sum cash payment (payable
          within ten (10) days of termination) in an amount equal to salary
          payable to the Employee for a period that is the longer of (x) twelve
          (12) months or (y) the remainder of the term of employment, plus the
          Employee's Guaranteed Bonus (without pro-ration) in the event such
          termination occurs on or prior to the payment of such Guaranteed Bonus
          and a pro-rated Bonus (pro-rated through the date of such termination)
          if such termination occurs in any year in respect of which the
          Guaranteed Bonus is not payable, with all of the foregoing payments
          made in lump sum within ten (10) days of the date of such termination;
          (8) a provision whereby the "non-compete clause" in the Employment
          Agreement is deleted if the Employee remains in the active employ of
          the Corporation for a period of six-months following a Change of
          Control, and (9) the obligation to pay the Enhanced Severance Payment
          shall be deleted.

          In the event that Employee's employment is terminated by the Employee
          for Good Reason, the Employee shall be entitled to, and his sole
          remedies shall be, the same benefits provided for in Section 6(d)
          hereof."

     (d)  Section 6(h) is hereby added to the Employment Agreement to read as

               (i)  Stay Bonus. The Employee shall be entitled to receive a lump
                    sum cash payment in an amount equal to the annualized rate
                    of his then current salary (the "Stay Bonus") upon the
                    earliest to occur of:

                    (A)  the six-month anniversary of the occurence of the
                         Change of Control (the "Six-Month Anniversary") if the
                         Employee is in the employ of the Corporation on such
                         date, in which

                     case the Stay Bonus shall be payable on the Six-Month
                     Anniversary;

                (B)  a termination by the Corporation (or any successor thereto)
                     without Cause (pursuant to Section 6(d) of the Employment
                     Agreement) on or after the occurrence of the Change of
                     Control but on or prior to the Six-Month Anniversary, in
                     which case the Stay Bonus shall be payable within ten (10)
                     days of such termination of employment; or

                (C)  a termination by the Employee for Good Reason (pursuant to
                     Section 6(e) of the Employment Agreement) on or after the
                     occurrence of the Change of Control but on or prior to the
                     Six-Month Anniversary, in which case the Stay Bonus shall
                     be payable within ten (10) days of such termination of
                     employment.

          (ii)  Enhanced Severance Payment. The Employee shall be entitled to
                receive a lump sum cash payment in an amount equal to fifty
                percent (50%) of his severance entitlement under the Employment
                Agreement (the result of which is the sum of (x) three (3)
                months of his then current salary and (y) two weeks of his then
                current salary (which is 50% of the amount payable as of the
                date hereof in accordance with the Corporation's standard
                severance policy based upon eight (8) years of service as of the
                date hereof)) (the "Enhanced Severance Payment") in the event
                the Employee's employment is terminated on or after the Change
                of Control but on or prior to the Six-Month Anniversary (x) by
                the Corporation (or any successor thereto) without Cause
                (pursuant to Section 6(d) of the Employment Agreement); or (y)
                by the Employee for Good Reason (pursuant to Section 6(e) of the
                Employment Agreement).

          (iii) For avoidance of doubt, each of the Stay Bonus and the Enhanced
                Severance Payment shall not be payable in the event the
                Employee's employment is terminated (A) by the Corporation for
                Cause, (B) by the Employee voluntarily without Good Reason, or
                (C) on account of Employee's death or Disability. In addition,
                the Enhanced Severance Payment shall not be payable if the
                Employee accepts continued employment following the Change of
                Control on the New Terms. The Stay Bonus and Enhanced Severance
                Payment payable pursuant to this Section 6(h) shall be payable
                in addition to (and not in lieu of) any other benefits which may
                be provided under the Employment Agreement (including, without
                limitation, the continuation of salary and benefits provided
                pursuant to Section 6(d) and 6(e) of the Employment Agreement).
