<P><FONT SIZE=2>A.
Secured Party loaned to Debtor Five Hundred Thousand U.S. Dollars ($500,000 and hereafter the "Amount") on May&nbsp;6, 2002 per the terms of the Convertible Promissory Note of May&nbsp;6, 2002
(the "Transaction"). The Transaction set forth that Debtor promised to pay the Amount back with interest under a Delayed Conversion as defined in the Transaction by the Maturity Date as also defined
in the Transaction. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>B.
In conjunction with the Transaction, the Debtor agreed to provide collateral for the loan using certain software defined herein (the "Collateral") for the benefit of the Secured Party. Thus, the
Debtor's obligations under the Transaction are to be secured by a security interest in the Collateral. This Security Agreement is intended to meet said requirement. </FONT></P>

SIZE=2><B>NOW THEREFORE,</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> based upon the foregoing premises, and in consideration of the covenants and agreements herein contained, Debtor and
Secured Party hereby agree as follows: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>Creation and Perfection of Security Interest.  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a.)&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Collateral is defined as the following software: Metrology Data Viewer (also known as MDV). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b.)&nbsp;&nbsp;As
security for due performance and payment in full by Debtor of the Transaction (the "Obligations"), Debtor hereby grants to Secured Party a security interest in the
Collateral. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c.)&nbsp;&nbsp;The
security interest created herein shall attach to the Collateral immediately upon the effective date hereof. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d.)&nbsp;&nbsp;The
security interest created herein may be perfected by any appropriate method requested by Secured Party. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>No Transfer, Further Encumbering, Etc.</I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secured Party agrees that the rights granted to Secured
Party hereunder are personal to Secured Party, and unless and until a Default (as defined in Section&nbsp;6 below) occurs hereunder, Secured Party may not directly or indirectly sell, assign,
transfer, convey or encumber the Collateral, or any part thereof or interest therein, or any of its rights hereunder, or permit any such action to be taken, by operation of law or otherwise without
the prior written consent of the Debtor. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>Continuous Security Interest.</I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debtor agrees that until Debtor has paid in full all obligations of
Debtor under the Transaction, or until termination of this Security Agreement by the Secured Party, all rights, powers and remedies granted to the Secured Party hereunder shall continue to and may be
exercised by Secured Party at any time, and from time to time, as long as the Security Interest is still in effect. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>Taxes, Charges and Liens.</I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debtor agrees to pay any and all taxes, charges, liens and assessment, if
any, against the Collateral, arising from and after the date hereof and upon the failure of Debtor to do so, Secured Party in its discretion may pay any of such taxes, charges, liens and assessments.

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>Right to Create Security Interest.</I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debtor hereby represents and warrants to Secured Party that on
and as of the effective date of this Security Agreement, Debtor has the absolute right and authority to enter into this Security Agreement and to hereby create in favor of Secured Party a valid and

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>Remedies Upon Default.</I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event of any material default by Debtor regarding Debtor's
obligations to Secured Party under the Transaction, the Secured Party may exercise all of the rights and remedies of a secured party under the Minnesota Uniform Commercial Code and, in addition, the
Secured Party may, without being required to give any notice, except as herein provided or as may be required by mandatory provisions of law, (a)&nbsp;apply the cash, if any, then held by it as
Collateral to all outstanding obligations of Debtor to Secured Party, and (b)&nbsp;if there shall be no such cash or if such cash shall be insufficient to pay all of the Obligations in full, sell
the Collateral, or any part thereof, at public or private sale, for cash, upon credit or for future delivery, and at such price or prices as the Secured Party may deem satisfactory. The Secured Party
may require the Debtor to assemble all or any part of the Collateral and make it available to the Secured Party at a place to be designated by the Secured Party, which is reasonably convenient to the
Debtor, and the Secured Party. The Secured Party may be the purchaser of any or all of the Collateral so sold at any public sale (or, if the Collateral is of a type customarily sold in a recognized

rights of redemption, stay or appraisal, which it has or may have under any rule of law or statute now existing or hereafter adopted. Any such public sale shall by held at such time or times within
ordinary business hours and at such place or places as the Secured Party may fix in the notice of such sale. At any such sale, the Collateral may e sold in one lot as an entirety or in separate
parcels, as the Secured Party may determine. The Secured Party shall not be obligated to make such sale pursuant to any such notice. The Secured Party may, without notice or publication, adjourn any
public or private sale or cause the same to be adjourned from time to time by announcement at the time and place fixed for the sale, and such sale may be made at any time or place to which that same
may be adjourned. In case of any sale of all or any part of the Collateral on credit or future delivery, the Collateral so sold may be retained by the Secured Party until the selling price is paid by
the purchaser to take up and pay for the Collateral so sold and, in case of any such failure, such Collateral may again be sold upon it, it may proceed by a suit or suits at law on in equity to
foreclose the security interest granted hereunder and sell the Collateral, or any portion thereof, under a judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>Termination.</I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Security Agreement shall automatically terminate upon due performance in full of
all of the Debtor's obligations under the Transaction, at which time the Collateral shall be fully released from the security interest created hereby, and any and all assignments and other instruments
delivered to Secured Party hereunder shall automatically expire and terminate. In such event, Secured Party shall promptly execute and deliver to Debtor a written release and cancellation hereof, and
take any and all
additional action reasonably requested by Debtor to restore full ownership of the Collateral in the Debtor, free and clear of any lien or encumbrance in favor of Secured Party. </FONT></P>

the successors and assigns of Debtor and Secured Party. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>No Waiver.</I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any forbearance or failure to exercise any right, power or remedy hereunder shall not be
deemed to be a waiver of such right, power or remedy, and any single or partial exercise of any right, power or remedy shall not preclude the further exercise thereof. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>Entire Agreement.</I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Security Agreement constitutes the entire and final agreement of the
