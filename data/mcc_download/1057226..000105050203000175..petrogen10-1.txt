Company (collectively, the "Expenses"); and which Expenses, it is hereby
acknowledged and agreed, shall be payable by the Company to the order, direction
and account of the Consultant as the Consultant may designate in writing, from
time to time, in the Consultant's sole and absolute discretion, as soon as
conveniently possible after the prior delivery by the Consultant to the Company
of written substantiation on account of each such reimbursable Expense.


                                    Article 5
                                    ---------
                    ADDITIONAL OBLIGATIONS OF THE CONSULTANT
                    ========================================

5.1 Reporting. At such time or times as may be required by the Board of
Directors of the Company, acting reasonably, the Consultant will provide the
Board of Directors with such information concerning the results of the
Consultant's General Services and activities hereunder for the previous month as
the Board of Directors may reasonably require.


5.2 No conflict, no competition and non-circumvention. During the continuance of
this Agreement the Consultant shall not engage in any business or activity which
reasonably may detract from or conflict with the Consultant's respective duties
and obligations to the Company as set forth in this Agreement without the prior
written consent of the Board of Directors of the Company. In addition, during
the continuance of this Agreement and for a period of at least six months
following the termination of this Agreement for any reason whatsoever the
Consultant shall not engage in any business or activity whatsoever which
reasonably may be determined by the Board of Director, in its sole and absolute
discretion, to compete with any portion of the Business interests as
contemplated hereby without the prior written consent of the Board of Directors.
Furthermore, the Consultant hereby acknowledges and agrees, for a period of at
least six months following the termination of this Agreement for any reason
whatsoever, not to initiate any contact or communication directly with either
the Company or any of its respective subsidiaries, as the case may be, together
with each of their respective directors, officers, representatives, agents or
employees, without the prior written consent of the Board of Directors and,
notwithstanding the generality of the foregoing, further acknowledges and
agrees, even with the prior written consent of the Board of Directors to such
contact or communication, to limit such contact or communication to discussions
outside the scope of any confidential information (as hereinafter determined).
For the purposes of the foregoing the Consultant hereby recognizes and agrees
that a breach by the Consultant of any of the covenants herein contained would
result in irreparable harm and significant damage to the Company that would not
be adequately compensated for by monetary award. Accordingly, the Consultant
agrees that, in the event of any such breach, in addition to being entitled as a
matter of right to apply to a Court of competent equitable jurisdiction for
relief by way of restraining order, injunction, decree or otherwise as may be
appropriate to ensure compliance with the provisions hereof, the Consultant will
also be liable to the Company, as liquidated damages, for an amount equal to the
amount received and earned by the Consultant as a result of and with respect to
any such breach. The Parties hereby acknowledge and agree that if any of the
aforesaid restrictions, activities, obligations or periods are considered by a
Court of competent jurisdiction as being unreasonable, the Parties agree that
said Court shall have authority to limit such restrictions, activities or

                        -Consulting Services Agreement-

further acknowledge and agree that all restrictions or obligations in this
Agreement are necessary and fundamental to the protection of the Business
interests and are reasonable and valid, and all defenses to the strict
enforcement thereof by the Consultant are hereby waived.


5.3 Confidentiality. The Consultant will not, except as authorized or required
by the Consultant's duties hereunder, reveal or divulge to any person or
companies any information concerning the organization, business, finances,
transactions or other affairs of the Company or of any of the Company's
respective subsidiaries which may come to the Consultant's knowledge during the
continuance of this Agreement, and the Consultant will keep in complete secrecy
all confidential information entrusted to the Consultant and will not use or
attempt to use any such information in any manner which may injure or cause loss
either directly or indirectly to the Company's Business interests. This
restriction will continue to apply after the termination of this Agreement
without limit in point of time but will cease to apply to information or
knowledge which may come into the public domain.


5.4 Compliance with applicable laws. The Consultant will comply with all
Canadian, U.S. and foreign laws, whether federal, provincial or state,
applicable to the Consultant's duties hereunder and, in addition, hereby
represents and warrants that any information which the Consultant may provide to
any person or company hereunder will, to the best of the Consultant's knowledge,
information and belief, be accurate and complete in all material respects and
not misleading, and will not omit to state any fact or information which would
be material to such person or company.

and agrees that all written and oral opinions, reports, advice and materials
provided by the Consultant to the Company in connection with the Consultant's
engagement hereunder are intended solely for the Company's benefit and for the
Company's use only, and that any such written and oral opinions, reports, advice

agrees that no public references to the Consultant or disclosure of the
Consultant's role in respect of the Company may be made by the Consultant
without the prior written consent of the Board of Directors of the Company in
each specific instance and, furthermore, that any such written opinions,
reports, advice or materials shall, unless otherwise required by the Board of
Directors, be provided by the Consultant to the Company in a form and with such
substance as would be acceptable for filing with and approval by any Regulatory
Authority having jurisdiction over the affairs of the Company from time to time.


5.6 Consultant's Business conduct. The Consultant warrants that the Consultant
shall conduct the business and other activities in a manner which is lawful and
reputable and which brings good repute to the Company, the Business interests

and the Consultant. In particular, and in this regard, the Consultant
specifically warrants to provide the General Services in a sound and
professional manner such that the same meets superior standards of performance
quality within the standards of the industry or as set by the specifications of
the Company. In the event that the Company has a reasonable concern that the
business as conducted by the Consultant is being conducted in a way contrary to
law or is reasonably likely to bring disrepute to the Business interests or to
the Company's or the Consultant's reputation, the Company may require that the
Consultant make such alterations in the Consultant's business conduct or
structure, whether of management or Board representation or employee or
sub-licensee representation, as the Board of Directors may reasonably require,
in its sole and absolute discretion, failing which the Company, in its sole and
absolute discretion, may terminate this Agreement upon 30 calendar days' prior
written notice to the Consultant. In the event of any debate or dispute as to
the reasonableness of the Board of Directors of the Company's request or
requirements, the judgment of the Board of Directors shall be deemed correct
until such time as the matter has been determined by arbitration in accordance
with Article "8" hereinbelow.


                                    Article 6
                                    ---------
                      INDEMNIFICATION AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
                      =====================================

6.1 Indemnification. The Parties hereto hereby each agree to indemnify and save
harmless the other Party hereto and including, where applicable, their
respective subsidiaries and affiliates and each of their respective directors,
officers, employees and agents (each such party being an "Indemnified Party")
harmless from and against any and all losses, claims, actions, suits,
proceedings, damages, liabilities or expenses of whatever nature or kind and
including, without limitation, any investigation expenses incurred by any
Indemnified Party, to which an Indemnified Party may become subject by reason of
the terms and conditions of this Agreement.


6.2 No Indemnification. This indemnity will not apply in respect of an
Indemnified Party in the event and to the extent that a Court of competent
jurisdiction in a final judgment shall determine that the Indemnified Party was
grossly negligent or guilty of willful misconduct.


6.3 Claim of Indemnification. The Parties hereto agree to waive any right they
might have of first requiring the Indemnified Party to proceed against or
enforce any other right, power, remedy, security or claim payment from any other
person before claiming this indemnity.


6.4 Notice of Claim. In case any action is brought against an Indemnified Party
in respect of which indemnity may be sought against either of the Parties
hereto, the Indemnified Party will give both Parties hereto prompt written
notice of any such action of which the Indemnified Party has knowledge and the
relevant Party will undertake the investigation and defense thereof on behalf of
the Indemnified Party, including the prompt employment of counsel acceptable to
the Indemnified Party affected and the relevant Party and the payment of all

<PAGE>


                                      -11-


expenses. Failure by the Indemnified Party to so notify shall not relieve the
relevant Party of such relevant Party's obligation of indemnification hereunder
unless (and only to the extent that) such failure results in a forfeiture by the
relevant Party of substantive rights or defenses.


6.5 Settlement. No admission of liability and no settlement of any action shall
be made without the consent of each of the Parties hereto and the consent of the
Indemnified Party affected, such consent not to be unreasonable withheld.


6.6 Legal Proceedings. Notwithstanding that the relevant Party will undertake
the investigation and defense of any action, an Indemnified Party will have the
right to employ separate counsel in any such action and participate in the
defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel will be at the
expense of the Indemnified Party unless:


     (a)  such counsel has been authorized by the relevant Party;


     (b)  the relevant Party has not assumed the defense of the action within a
          reasonable period of time after receiving notice of the action;


     (c)  the named parties to any such action include that any Party hereto and
          the Indemnified Party shall have been advised by counsel that there
          may be a conflict of interest between any Party hereto and the
          Indemnified Party; or


     (d)  there are one or more legal defenses available to the Indemnified
          Party which are different from or in addition to those available to
          any Party hereto.


6.7 Contribution. If for any reason other than the gross negligence or bad faith
of the Indemnified Party being the primary cause of the loss claim, damage,
liability, cost or expense, the foregoing indemnification is unavailable to the
Indemnified Party or insufficient to hold them harmless, the relevant Party
shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by the Indemnified Party as a
result of any and all such losses, claim, damages or liabilities in such
proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits received
by the relevant Party on the one hand and the Indemnified Party on the other,
but also the relative fault of relevant Party and the Indemnified Party and
other equitable considerations which may be relevant. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the relevant Party shall in any event contribute to the amount paid
or payable by the Indemnified Party, as a result of the loss, claim, damage,
liability, cost or expense (other than a loss, claim, damage, liability, cost or
expenses, the primary cause of which is the gross negligence or bad faith of the
Indemnified Party), any excess of such amount over the amount of the fees
actually received by the Indemnified Party hereunder.

or thereafter prevented or delayed in complying with any provisions of this
Agreement by reason of strikes, walk-outs, labour shortages, power shortages,
fires, wars, acts of God, earthquakes, storms, floods, explosions, accidents,
protests or demonstrations by environmental lobbyists or native rights groups,
delays in transportation, breakdown of machinery, inability to obtain necessary
materials in the open market, unavailability of equipment, governmental
regulations restricting normal operations, shipping delays or any other reason
or reasons beyond the control of that Party, then the time limited for the
performance by that Party of its respective obligations hereunder shall be
extended by a period of time equal in length to the period of each such
prevention or delay.


7.2 Notice. A Party shall within three calendar days give notice to the other
Party of each event of force majeure under section "7.1" hereinabove, and upon
cessation of such event shall furnish the other Party with notice of that event

Party hereunder have been extended by virtue of such event of force majeure and

                                   ===========

8.1 Matters for Arbitration. Except for matters of indemnity or in the case of
urgency to prevent material harm to a substantive right or asset, the Parties
agree that all questions or matters in dispute with respect to this Agreement
shall be submitted to arbitration pursuant to the terms hereof. This provision
shall not prejudice a Party from seeking a Court order or assistance to garnish
or secure sums or to seek summary remedy for such matters as counsel may
consider amenable to summary proceedings.


8.2 Notice. It shall be a condition precedent to the right of any Party to
submit any matter to arbitration pursuant to the provisions hereof that any
Party intending to refer any matter to arbitration shall have given not less
than five business days' prior written notice of its intention to do so to the
other Parties together with particulars of the matter in dispute. On the
expiration of such five business days the Party who gave such notice may proceed
to refer the dispute to arbitration as provided for in section "8.3"
hereinbelow.


8.3 Appointments. The Party desiring arbitration shall appoint one arbitrator,
and shall notify the other Parties of such appointment, and the other Parties
shall, within five business days after receiving such notice, appoint an
arbitrator, and the two arbitrators so named, before proceeding to act, shall,
within five business days of the appointment of the last appointed arbitrator,
unanimously agree on the appointment of a third arbitrator, to act with them and
be chairperson of the arbitration herein provided for. If the other Parties

shall fail to appoint an arbitrator within five business days after receiving
notice of the appointment of the first arbitrator, and if the two arbitrators
appointed by the Parties shall be unable to agree on the appointment of the
chairperson, the chairperson shall be appointed in accordance with the
Arbitration Act. Except as specifically otherwise provided in this section, the
arbitration herein provided for shall be conducted in accordance with such
Arbitration Act. The chairperson, or in the case where only one arbitrator is
appointed, the single arbitrator, shall fix a time and place for the purpose of
hearing the evidence and representations of the Parties, and the chairperson
shall preside over the arbitration and determine all questions of procedure not
provided for by the Arbitration Act or this section. After hearing any evidence
and representations that the Parties may submit, the single arbitrator, or the
arbitrators, as the case may be, shall make an award and reduce the same to
writing, and deliver one copy thereof to each of the Parties. The expense of the
arbitration shall be paid as specified in the award.


8.4 Award. The Parties agree that the award of a majority of the arbitrators, or
in the case of a single arbitrator, of such arbitrator, shall be final and
binding upon each of them.
