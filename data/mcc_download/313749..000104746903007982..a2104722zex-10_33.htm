Although La Quinta does not have employment contracts for our officers, we will commit that if you are terminated from the Company without cause, that your severance payment will be one (1)&nbsp;year salary and target bonus. Furthermore, in the event
you are terminated without cause, you will be entitled to continue to receive during the severance period such Company provided group health insurance, life insurance and long-term disability coverage as are in effect for you at the time of
termination, as available through the Company's programs. In the event your employment with La Quinta is terminated voluntarily or by reason of death, disability (which may entitle you to coverage under the long-term disability plan) or for "cause,"
no severance would be due or payable. For purposes thereof, "cause" shall be (a)&nbsp;your willful and continuing failure to discharge your duties and responsibilities to La Quinta, (b)&nbsp;any material act of dishonesty involving La Quinta,
(c)&nbsp;violation of Company policy of procedures or (d)&nbsp;conviction of a felony. If termination of employment were due to a change of control, then your severance would be two years salary and two years target bonus and vesting of all stock
options and stock grants. You will be entitled to continue to receive during the two-year severance period such Company provided group health insurance, life insurance and long-term disability coverage as are in effect for you at the time of
termination, as available through the Company's programs.</FONT></TD>
