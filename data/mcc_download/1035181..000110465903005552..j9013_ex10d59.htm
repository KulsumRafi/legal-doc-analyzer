Purchaser understands (i) that the Shares are not registered under the
Securities Act or qualified under the California Corporate Securities Law of
1968, as amended (the &#147;Law&#148;), and (ii) that the Shares are being issued to the
Purchaser on the ground that the sale provided for in this Agreement and the
issuance of securities hereunder is exempt from registration under the
Securities Act pursuant to Section 4(2) thereof and/or Regulation D promulgated
thereunder and the exemption from qualification provided by Section 25102(f) of
the Law, and (iii) that the Company&#146;s reliance on such exemptions is predicated
on the Purchaser&#146;s representations set forth herein.&#160; The Purchaser realizes that the basis for the exemptions may not
be present if, notwithstanding such representations, the Purchaser has in mind
merely acquiring the Common Stock for a fixed or determinable period in the
future, or for a market rise, or for sale if the market does not rise.&#160; The Purchaser does not have any such
intention.&#160; These exemptions only exempt
the issuance of the Shares to the Purchaser and not any sale or other
disposition of the Shares or any interest therein by the Purchaser.</p>

registered under the Federal securities laws or unless an exemption from such
registration is available.&#160; In addition,
the Purchaser understands that any resale or transfer must comply with
applicable state securities laws.&#160;
Accordingly, the Purchaser hereby acknowledges that the Purchaser is
prepared to hold the Shares for an indefinite period, and that the Purchaser is
familiar with the provisions of Rule 144 of the Securities and Exchange
Commission issued under the Securities Act, and is aware that Rule 144 is not
presently available to exempt the sale of the Shares from the registration
requirements of the Securities Act.&#160;
Nothing contained herein shall be deemed a representation or warranty by
such Purchaser to hold Shares or Conversion Shares for any period of time.</p>

the Company possessed such information or could acquire it without unreasonable
