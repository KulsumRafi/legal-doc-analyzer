OCTANE  CORPORATION,  INC.,  a  Delaware corporation (hereinafter referred to as

or  "Buyer") and IAN T. BOTHWELL (hereinafter referred to as "Bothwell"), on the
other  hand.

     A.     B&A  desires  to  transfer, and POC desires to acquire, that certain
equipment  set  forth  in  this  Agreement, on the terms and conditions provided
herein,  as  payment in full of the remaining balance on that promissory note in
the  amount  of  $300,000 in which POC is the payee and B&A and Bothwell are the
makers  (the "$300,000 Note") and payment in full of that promissory note in the
