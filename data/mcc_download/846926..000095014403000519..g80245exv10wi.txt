                  The laws of South Carolina provide that in any real estate
foreclosure proceeding a defendant against whom a personal judgment is taken or
asked may within thirty days after the sale of the mortgaged property apply to
the court for an order of appraisal. The statutory appraisal value as approved
by the court would be substituted for the high bid and may decrease the amount
of any deficiency owing in connection with the transaction. THE UNDERSIGNED
HEREBY WAIVE AND RELINQUISH THE STATUTORY APPRAISAL RIGHTS WHICH MEANS THE HIGH
BID AT THE JUDICIAL FORECLOSURE SALE WILL BE APPLIED TO THE DEBT REGARDLESS OF
ANY APPRAISED VALUE OF THE MORTGAGED PROPERTY.
