remedy does not exist and a remedy at law may prove to be be inadequate. Accordingly, in the event of any actual or threatened breach by the Executive of any provision of this Employment Agreement, the Company will, in addition to any other remedies
permitted by law, be entitled to obtain remedies in equity, including without limitation specific performance, injunctive relief, a temporary restraining order and/or a permanent injunction in any court of competent jurisdiction, to prevent or
otherwise restrain any such breach without the necessity of proving damages, posting a bond or other security, and to recover any and all costs and expenses, including reasonable counsel fees, incurred in enforcing this Employment Agreement against
the Executive, and the Executive hereby consents to the entry of such relief against the Executive and agrees not to contest such entry. Such relief will be in addition to and not in substitution of any other remedies available to the Company. The
existence of any claim or cause of action by the Executive against the Company or any of its subsidiaries, whether predicated on this Employment Agreement or otherwise, will not constitute a defense to the enforcement by the Company of this
Employment Agreement. The Executive agrees not to defend on the basis that there is an adequate remedy at law. </FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT
