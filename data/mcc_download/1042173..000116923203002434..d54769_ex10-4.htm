purpose of the 1999 Non-Employee Directors&#146; Stock Option Plan (the           &#147;Plan&#148;)
is to provide a means by which each member of the Board of           Directors of
Scientific Learning Corporation (the &#147;Company&#148;) who is           not at the
time of grant an employee of the Company or of any Affiliate of the           Company, or
a holder or representative of the holder of 10% or more of the           Company&#146;s
capital stock (each such person being hereafter referred to as a           &#147;Non-Employee
Director&#148;) will be given an opportunity to purchase           stock of the Company.  </FONT></P>

word &#147;Affiliate&#148; as used in the Plan means any parent corporation           or
subsidiary corporation of the Company as those terms are defined in Sections
          424(e) and (f), respectively, of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
          from time to time (the &#147;Code&#148;).  </FONT></P>

Company, by means of the Plan, seeks to retain the services of persons now
          serving as Non-Employee Directors of the Company, to secure and retain the
          services of persons capable of serving in such capacity, and to provide
          incentives for such persons to exert maximum efforts for the success of the
          Company.  </FONT></P>

Board may delegate administration of the Plan to a committee composed of two
          (2) or more members of the Board (the &#147;Committee&#148;). If administration
          is delegated to a Committee, the Committee shall have, in connection with the
          administration of the Plan, the powers theretofore possessed by the Board,
          subject, however, to such resolutions, not inconsistent with the provisions of
          the Plan, as may be adopted from time to time by the Board. The Board may
          abolish the Committee at any time and revest in the Board the administration of
          the Plan.  </FONT></P>
