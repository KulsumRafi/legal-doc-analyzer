<P><FONT SIZE=2>This
letter amends that certain letter agreement dated May&nbsp;6, 2002 (the "Letter Agreement") between VitalStream Holdings,&nbsp;Inc. ("VitalStream") and The Seidler Companies,&nbsp;Inc.
("Seidler"), as amended by that Confirmation Letter dated October&nbsp;25, 2002 (which Confirmation Letter this letter supersedes and replaces) and the letter-form amendment dated
January&nbsp;6, 2003. In connection with VitalStream's purchase, through a subsidiary, of certain assets of Epoch Hosting,&nbsp;Inc. and its affiliates (the "Asset Purchase") and the investment of
$1,100,000 by Dolphin Communications Fund II, LP and Dolphin Communications Parallel Fund II, LP (the "Note&nbsp;Purchase"), VitalStream agrees to pay to Seidler the following consideration: </FONT></P>

VitalStream under Section&nbsp;3b of the Letter Agreement. Such warrants will be issued in the form attached to the Letter Agreement as Exhibit&nbsp;B.
