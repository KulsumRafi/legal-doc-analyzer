a trustee, receiver, custodian, liquidator, assignee, sequestrator or the like

with respect to such Person under any law relating to bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, winding up or composition or adjustment of debts, and such case

successors) as their respective prime commercial lending rates (or, as to any
such bank that does not announce such a rate, such bank's "base" or other rate
determined by the Lender to be the equivalent rate announced by such bank),
except that, if any such bank shall, for any period, cease to announce publicly
its prime commercial lending (or equivalent) rate, the Agent shall, during such
period, determine the Base Rate based upon the prime commercial lending (or
equivalent) rates announced publicly by the other such banks or, if each such
bank ceases to announce publicly its prime commercial lending (or equivalent)
rate, based upon the prime commercial lending (or equivalent) rate or rates
announced publicly by one or more other banks reasonably acceptable to the
Borrower. The prime commercial lending (or equivalent) rates used in computing
the Base Rate are not intended to be the lowest rates of interest charged by
such banks in connection with extensions of credit to debtors. The Base Rate

          (xii) on or after the occurrence of the Early Amortization
     Commencement Date, to the Agent for the account of the Lender for the
     repayment of Loans Outstanding in an amount equal to the lesser of (A) all
     remaining funds in the Collection Account and (B) an amount necessary to
     repay the outstanding principal amount of all Loans in full; and

          (xiii) to the Borrower, any remaining amounts.

Upon its receipt of funds pursuant to clauses (i), (v), (xi) and (xii), the

in this Agreement.

          (d) Borrower Deficiency Payments. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Section 2.05 or in any other provision in this
Agreement, if, on any day prior to the Collection Date, the Facility Amount

prior to any Borrowing and in any event no later than the close of business of
the Agent on such day (or if such day is not a Business Day, no later than the
close of business of the Agent on the next succeeding Business Day), a payment
(to be applied by the Agent to repay Loans selected by the Agent, in its sole
discretion), in such amount as may be necessary to reduce the Facility Amount to
an amount less than or equal to the Borrowing Limit. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Section 2.05 or in any other provision in this
Agreement, if, on any day prior to the Collection Date, the Facility Amount
shall exceed the Capital Limit, then the Borrower shall (X) remit to the Agent,
prior to any Borrowing and in any event no later than the close of business of
the Agent on such day (or if such day is not a Business Day, no later than the

                                       32

<PAGE>

close of business of the Agent on the next succeeding Business Day), a payment

discretion), in such amount as may be necessary to reduce the Facility Amount to
an amount less than or equal to the Capital Limit or (Y) Pledge additional
Eligible Receivables hereunder, prior to any Borrowing and in any event no later
than the close of business of the Agent on such day (or if such day is not a
Business Day, no later than the close of business of the Agent on the next
succeeding Business Day) in such amount as may be necessary to increase the
Capital Limit to an amount equal to or greater than the Facility Amount.

          (e) Instructions to the Agent's Bank. All instructions and directions
given to the Agent's Bank by the Servicer or the Agent pursuant to this Section
2.05 shall be in writing (including instructions and directions transmitted to
the Agent's Bank by telecopy), and such written instructions and directions
shall be delivered with a written certification that such instructions and
directions are in compliance with the provisions of this Section 2.05. The

          (f) Transfers from Collection Account Related to the Sinking Fund
Account. The Servicer shall, with the written consent of the Agent, and if the
Servicer fails to do so the Agent may, on each Borrowing Date and each other

Agent's Bank to transfer collected funds held by the Agent's Bank in the
Collection Account in the following amounts and priority:

     in an amount equal to (and for repayment of) any funds expended by the
     Agent to purchase any Purchased Rate Caps which the Borrower failed to
     purchase notwithstanding its obligation to do so under the terms of the
     Sinking Fund Account Agreement; and

          (iii) without limiting the obligations of the Borrower under the
     Sinking Fund Account Agreement and at the election of the Agent, to the
     applicable counterparty in an amount equal to (and for payment of) any
     Purchased Rate Caps which the Borrower failed to purchase notwithstanding
     its obligation to do so under the terms of the Sinking Fund Account
     Agreement.

          SECTION 2.06 [Intentionally Omitted.]

          SECTION 2.07 Substitution of Pledged Receivables. (a) The Borrower
may, upon two (2) Business Day's prior written notice to the Agent, replace any
Receivable as a Pledged Receivable ("Substituted Receivable") so long as (i)
simultaneously therewith, the Borrower Pledges (in accordance with all of the
terms and provisions contained herein) a Receivable or

                                       33

<PAGE>

Receivables (each, a "Replacement Receivable"), which (A) at the time of such
Pledge are Eligible Receivables and (B) which have an aggregate Outstanding
Balance that equals or exceeds the Outstanding Balance of the Substituted
Receivable being removed, (ii) the Weighted Average Remaining Term of all
Pledged Receivables will not increase or decrease by more than three months
after giving effect to such replacement, and (iii) if the Substituted Receivable
is either a Defaulted Receivable or a Delinquent Receivable at the time of such
replacement, the aggregate amount of Outstanding Balances (calculated at the
time of replacement) of all Defaulted Receivables and Delinquent Receivables
which were replaced in accordance with this Section 2.07 or repurchased by FCC
during the period beginning 365 days prior to the date of such replacement and
ending on and including the date of such replacement (after giving effect to
such replacement) shall not exceed an amount equal to 15% of the Outstanding
Balances of all of the Contracts purchased by the Borrower (each such
Outstanding Balance determined as of the time of purchase) under the Purchase
and Contribution Agreement during such period. Upon the replacement of a
Substituted Receivable, such Substituted Receivable shall no longer be a Pledged
Receivable for purposes of this Agreement.

          (b) Solely for purposes of calculating the Annualized Default Rate and
the Delinquency Rate, (i) Substituted Receivables shall be deemed to be Pledged
Receivables for three Remittance Periods following their replacement and (ii)
any Substituted Receivable which was a Delinquent Receivable at the time of
replacement shall be deemed to have become a Defaulted Receivable as of the date
of such replacement.

          SECTION 2.09 [Intentionally Omitted.]

          SECTION 2.10 [Intentionally Omitted.]

          SECTION 2.11 Payments and Computations, Etc. (a) All amounts to be
paid or deposited by the Borrower or the Servicer hereunder shall be paid or
deposited in accordance with the terms hereof no later than 1:00 P.M. (New York
City time) on the day when due in lawful money of the United States in
immediately available funds to the Collection Account or such other account as
is designated by the Lender. The Borrower shall, to the extent permitted by law,
pay to the Agent interest on all amounts not paid or deposited when due
hereunder (whether owing by the Borrower or the Servicer) at the Default Funding
Rate payable on demand; provided, however, that such interest rate shall not at
any time exceed the maximum rate permitted by applicable law. Such interest
shall be for the account of, and distributed by the Agent to, the Lender. Any
Obligation hereunder shall not be reduced by any distribution of any portion of
Collections if at any time such distribution is rescinded or returned by the
Lender to the Borrower or any other Person for any reason. All computations of
interest and all computations of Yield, Liquidation Fee and other fees hereunder
(including, without limitation, the Fees and the Servicing Fee) shall be made on
the basis of a year of 360 days for the actual number of days (including the
first but excluding the last day) elapsed.

          (b) Whenever any payment hereunder shall be stated to be due on a day
other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding
Business Day, and such

                                       34

<PAGE>

extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of payment
of Yield, interest or any fee payable hereunder, as the case may be; provided,
however, that with respect to the calculation of Yield, such extension of time
shall not be included in more than one Fixed Period.

          (c) If any Borrowing requested by the Borrower and approved by the
Lender and the Agent pursuant to Section 2.02 or any selection of any Fixed
Period requested by the Borrower and approved by the Agent pursuant to Section
2.04 is not for any reason whatsoever, except as a result of the gross
negligence or wilful misconduct of the Lender, the Agent or an Affiliate
thereof, made or effectuated, as the case may be, on the date specified
therefor, the Borrower shall indemnify the Lender against any loss, cost or
expense incurred by the Lender related thereto (other than any such loss, cost
or expense solely due to the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the
Lender, the Agent or an Affiliate thereof), including, without limitation, any
loss (including cost of funds and reasonable out-of-pocket expenses), cost or
expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or
other funds acquired by the Lender to fund Loans or maintain Loans during such
Fixed Period. The Lender shall provide to the Borrower documentation setting
forth the amounts of any loss, cost or expense referred to in the previous
sentence, such documentation to be conclusive absent manifest error.

          SECTION 2.12 Fees. (a) The Borrower shall pay the Lender (either
directly or through the Agent) certain fees (the "Fees") in the amounts and on
the dates set forth in a fee letter (the "Fee Letter"), dated the date hereof,
among the Borrower, FCC, the Agent, and the Lender.

          (b) All of the Fees payable pursuant to this Section 2.12 shall be
payable solely from amounts available for application pursuant to, and subject
to the priority of payment set forth in, Section 2.05.

          SECTION 2.13 Increased Costs; Capital Adequacy. (a) If, due to either
(i) the introduction of or any change (including, without limitation, any change
by way of imposition or increase of reserve requirements) in or in the
interpretation, administration or application of any law or regulation
(including, without limitation, any law or regulation resulting in any interest
payments paid to a Lender under this Agreement being subject to United States
withholding tax) or any guideline of any accounting board or authority (whether
or not a part of government) which is responsible for the establishment or
interpretation of national or international accounting principles, in each case
whether foreign or domestic or (ii) the compliance with any guideline or request
from any central bank or other governmental authority (whether or not having the
force of law), there shall be any increase in the cost to the Agent, the Lender,
or any Affiliate, successor or assign thereof (each of which shall be an
"Affected Party") of agreeing to make or making, funding or maintaining any Loan
(or any reduction of the amount of any payment (whether of principal, interest,
fee, compensation or otherwise) to any Affected Party hereunder), as the case
may be, the Borrower shall, from time to time, within ten (10) days after
written demand complying with Section 2.13(c) by the Agent, on behalf of such
Affected Party, pay to the Agent, on behalf of such Affected Party, additional
amounts sufficient to compensate such Affected Party for such increased costs or
reduced payments. For the avoidance of doubt, any interpretation of Accounting
Research Bulletin No. 51 by the Financial Accounting Standards Board shall
constitute a change in the interpretation, administration or application of a
guideline subject to this Section 2.13(a).

                                       35

<PAGE>

          (b) If either (i) the introduction of or any change in or in the
interpretation, administration or application of any law, guideline, rule or
regulation, directive or request or (ii) the compliance by any Affected Party
with any law, guideline, rule, regulation, directive or request, from any
central bank, any governmental authority or agency or any accounting board or
authority (whether or not a part of government) which is responsible for the
establishment or interpretation of national or international accounting
principles, in each case whether foreign or domestic (whether or not having the
force of law), including, without limitation, compliance by an Affected Party
with any request or directive regarding capital adequacy, has or would have the
effect of reducing the rate of return on the capital of any Affected Party, as a
consequence of its obligations hereunder or any related document or arising in
connection herewith or therewith to a level below that which any such Affected
Party could have achieved but for such introduction, change or compliance
(taking into consideration the policies of such Affected Party with respect to
capital adequacy), by an amount deemed by such Affected Party to be material,
then, from time to time, after demand by such Affected Party (which demand shall
be accompanied by a statement setting forth the basis of such demand), the Agent
shall be paid, on behalf of such Affected Party (from Collections pursuant to,
and subject to the priority of payment set forth in, Section 2.05), such
additional amounts as will compensate such Affected Party for such reduction.
For the avoidance of doubt, any interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin
No. 51 by the Financial Accounting Standards Board shall constitute a change in
the interpretation, administration or application of a guideline subject to this
Section 2.13(b).

          (c) In determining any amount provided for in this Section 2.13, the
Affected Party may use any reasonable averaging and attribution methods. The
Agent, on behalf of any Affected Party making a claim under this Section 2.13,
shall submit to the Borrower a certificate setting forth in reasonable detail
the basis for and the computations of such additional or increased costs, which
certificate shall be conclusive absent demonstrable error.

          (d) If, as a result of any event or circumstance similar to those
described in Section 2.13(a) or 2.13(b), any Affected Party (that is an Issuer)
is required to compensate a bank or other financial institution (including,
without limitation, DZ BANK) providing liquidity support, credit enhancement or
other similar support to such Affected Party in connection with this Agreement,
then, upon demand by the Agent, on behalf of such Affected Party, the Borrower
shall pay to the Agent, on behalf of such Affected Party such additional amount
or amounts as may be necessary to reimburse such Affected Party for any amounts
paid by it.

          SECTION 2.14 Collateral Assignment of Agreements. The Borrower hereby
collaterally assigns to the Agent, for the benefit of the Lender, all of the
Borrower's right and title to and interest in, to and under (but not any
obligations under) the Purchase and Contribution Agreement, the Contract, any
insurance policies and the Contractor Sale Agreement or the NY Purchase
Agreement (as applicable) related to each Pledged Receivable, all other
agreements, documents and instruments evidencing, securing or guarantying any
Pledged Receivable and all other agreements, documents and instruments related
to any of the foregoing (the "Assigned Documents"). Without limiting any
obligation of the Servicer hereunder, the Borrower confirms and agrees that the
Agent (or any designee thereof, including, without limitation, the Servicer),
following an Event of Default or an Early Amortization Event, shall have the
right to enforce the

                                       36

obligation on the part of the Agent, the Lender or any of their respective
Affiliates to perform any of the obligations of the Borrower under any such
Assigned Document. In addition, each of the Servicer and the Borrower confirms
and agrees that the Servicer and the Borrower will, upon receipt of notice or
discovery thereof, promptly send to the Agent a notice of (i) any breach of any
representation, warranty, agreement or covenant under any such Assigned Document
or (ii) any event or occurrence that, upon notice, or upon the passage of time
or both, would constitute such a breach, in each case, immediately upon learning
thereof. The parties hereto agree that such assignment to the Agent shall
terminate upon the Collection Date.

complete payment when due of the Obligations and the performance by the Borrower
of all of the covenants and obligations to be performed by it pursuant to this
Agreement, the Borrower hereby (i) collaterally assigns and pledges to the
Agent, on behalf of the Lender (and its successors and assigns) and (ii) grants

and assigns), in all of the following property whether tangible or intangible

Subsequent Borrowing Date and Remittance Date thereafter. If, as a result of the
breach of any of the representations and warranties in Section 4.01 or Section
4.02 or for any other reason there exists or would exist a Borrowing Base
Deficiency, the Borrower shall promptly (and, in any case, by the end of
business on the Business Day on which such Borrowing Base Deficiency occurred)
(X) repay to the Agent, for the account of the Lender, the portion of the Loans
as is necessary to cure such Borrowing Base Deficiency or (Y) Pledge additional
Eligible Receivables as is necessary to cure such Borrowing Base Deficiency. The

Agent the Release Price therefor on the date of such repayment plus, in the case
of any such release related to a Whole Loan Sale, the Disposition Fee (as
defined in the Fee Letter) payable in connection with such Whole Loan Sale;
provided, that the foregoing release shall only be available if, after giving
effect thereto and the application of the proceeds thereof in accordance with
the terms hereof, there shall not be a Borrowing Base Deficiency or Early
Amortization Event, or an event that but for notice or lapse of time or both
would constitute an Early Amortization Event or (ii) the substitution of any
Pledged Receivable in accordance with Section 2.07, the Borrower may, with the
consent of the Agent

                                       38

clear of any Adverse Claim resulting solely from an act by the Lender or the
Agent but without any other representation or warranty, express or implied, by
or recourse against the Lender or the Agent.

          (d) Upon the request of the Borrower, and at the Borrower's expense,
the Agent will execute and deliver such instruments and perform such acts as may
be reasonably necessary to carry out the purposes of this Section 2.18.

          SECTION 2.19 Treatment of Amounts Paid by the Borrower. Amounts paid
by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.18 on account of Pledged Receivables shall
be treated as payments on Pledged Receivables hereunder.

          SECTION 2.20 Prepayment; Termination. Except as expressly permitted or
required herein, including, without limitation, any repayment necessary to cure
a Borrowing Base Deficiency and any repayment from Collections on Pledged
Receivables (including Collections related to the prepayment of such Pledged
Receivables), no Loan may be repaid prior to the Early Amortization Commencement
Date without the Agent's prior written consent, which consent may be withheld in
the Agent's sole discretion; provided, however, that upon ten (10) Business
Days' prior written notice to the Agent, the Borrower may prepay, in part or in
whole, the principal of the Loans advanced hereunder in connection with a
Take-Out Securitization or a Whole Loan Sale (so long as (i) no selection
procedures adverse to the interests of the Agent or the Lender have been
utilized by the Borrower in selecting such Receivables for such Take-Out
Securitization or Whole Loan Sale and (ii) after giving effect to such Whole
Loan Sale the aggregate amount of Receivables sold in connection with Whole Loan
Sales during any calendar year shall not exceed $10,000,000). Notwithstanding

which is not collected, not paid or uncollectible on account of the insolvency,

do business as a foreign corporation in any other state in which it does
business and in which it is required to so qualify under applicable law.

          (b) The Borrower will at all times ensure that (i) its board of
directors acts independently and in its interests and in the interest of its
creditors, (ii) it shall at all times maintain at least two independent
directors, each of whom (A) is not currently and have not been during the five
(5) years preceding the date of this Agreement an officer, director or employee
of the Borrower or an Affiliate thereof and (B) is not a holder of any equity
interest of the Borrower or an Affiliate thereof, (iii) its assets are not
commingled with those of FCC or any other Affiliate of the Borrower, (iv) its
board of directors duly authorizes all of its corporate actions, (v) it
maintains separate and accurate records and books of account and such books and
records are kept separate from those of FCC and any other Affiliate of the
Borrower and (vi) it maintains minutes of the meetings and other proceedings of
the shareholders and the board of directors. Where necessary, the Borrower will
obtain proper authorization from its shareholders for corporate action.

          (c) The Borrower will pay its operating expenses and liabilities from
its own assets.

          (d) The Borrower will not have any of its indebtedness guaranteed by
FCC or any Affiliate of FCC. Furthermore, the Borrower will not hold itself out,
or permit itself to be held out, as having agreed to pay or as being liable for
the debts of FCC, and the Borrower will not engage in business transactions with
FCC, except on an arm's-length basis. The Borrower will not hold FCC out to
third parties as other than an entity with assets and liabilities distinct from
the Borrower. The Borrower will cause any of its financial statements
consolidated with those of FCC to state that the Borrower is a separate
corporate entity with its own separate creditors who, in any liquidation of the
Borrower, will be entitled to be satisfied out of the Borrower's assets prior to
any value in the Borrower becoming available to the Borrower's equity holders.
The Borrower will not act in any other matter that could foreseeably mislead
others with respect to the Borrower's separate identity.

          (e) In its capacity as Servicer, FCC will, to the extent necessary,
maintain separate records on behalf of and for the benefit of the Agent and the
Lender, act in accordance with instructions and directions, delivered in
accordance with the terms hereof, from the Borrower, the Agent and/or the Lender
in connection with its servicing of the Pledged Receivables hereunder, and will
ensure that, at all times when it is dealing with or in connection with the
Pledged Receivables in its capacity as Servicer, it holds itself out as
Servicer, and not in any other capacity.

          (f) The Servicer (if FCC or an Affiliate thereof) shall, to the extent
required by applicable law, disclose all material transactions associated with
this transaction in appropriate regulatory filings and public announcements. The
annual financial statements of FCC (including any consolidated financial
statements) shall disclose the effects of the transactions contemplated by the
Purchase and Contribution Agreement as a sale or capital contribution of
Receivables, Related Security and Other Conveyed Property to the Borrower, and
the annual financial statements of the Borrower shall disclose the effects of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as a loan to the extent required
by and in accordance with GAAP, it being understood that the Loans to the
Borrower under this Agreement will be treated as debt on the consolidated
financial statements of FCC.

          (g) The Borrower shall take all other actions necessary to maintain
the accuracy of the factual assumptions set forth in the legal opinions of
Andrews & Kurth L.L.P., as special counsel to FCC and the Borrower, issued in
connection with the Purchase and Contribution Agreement and relating to the
issues of substantive consolidation and true conveyance of the Pledged
Receivables.

          (h) Except as otherwise provided herein or in any other Transaction
Document, neither the Borrower nor the Servicer shall sell, assign (by operation
of law or otherwise) or otherwise dispose of, or create or suffer to exist any
Adverse Claim upon or with respect to, any Pledged Receivable, any Collections
related thereto or any other Pledged Assets related thereto, or upon or with
respect to any account to which any Collections of any Receivable are sent, or
assign any right to receive income in respect thereof. Except as otherwise
provided herein or in any other Transaction Document, the Borrower shall not
create or suffer to exist any Adverse Claim upon or with respect to any of the
Borrower's assets. Except as otherwise provided herein or in any other
Transaction Document, the Servicer shall not create, or permit any action to be
taken by any Person to create, any Adverse Claim upon or with respect to any of
the Borrower's assets.

          (i) The Borrower will not merge or consolidate with, or convey,
transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of (whether in one transaction or in a
series of transactions), all or substantially all of its assets (whether now
owned or hereafter acquired) other than, with respect to asset dispositions in
connection with a Take-Out Securitization or a Whole Loan Sale, or acquire all
or substantially all of the assets or capital stock or other ownership interest
of any Person without the prior written consent of the Agent.

          (j) The Borrower will not account for or treat (whether in financial
statements or otherwise) the transactions contemplated by the Purchase and
Contribution Agreement in any

                                       50

<PAGE>

manner other than a sale or capital contribution and absolute assignment of
Receivables, Related Security and Other Conveyed Property by FCC to the Borrower
constituting a "true conveyance" for bankruptcy purposes, it being understood
that the Loans to the Borrower under this Agreement will be treated as debt on
the consolidated financial statements of FCC.

          (k) The Borrower will not amend, modify, waive or terminate any terms
or conditions of the Purchase and Contribution Agreement without the written
consent of the Agent, and shall perform its obligations thereunder.

          (l) The Borrower will not amend, modify or otherwise make any change
to its certificate of incorporation or by-laws without the consent of the Agent.

          (m) Neither the Borrower nor the Servicer will make or allow to be
made any amendment to the Credit and Collection Policy without the prior written
consent of the Agent.

          (n) If the Borrower or the Servicer receive any Collections, the
Borrower or the Servicer, as applicable, will remit such Collections to the
Collection Account within one (1) Business Day of the Borrower's or the
Servicer's receipt thereof.

          (o) The Servicer and the Borrower shall cause the Obligor of each
Pledged Receivable to remit all Collections owed by such Obligor to the Lockbox
or by wire transfer to the Lockbox Account (and shall ensure that only funds
constituting Collections shall be deposited into the Lockbox Account). The Agent
shall cause (i) the Lockbox Bank to deposit all Collections in the Lockbox into
the Lockbox Account on each Business Day and (ii) the Lockbox Bank to remit all
Collections on deposit in the Lockbox Account to the Collection Account on each
Business Day.

          (p) The Borrower shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the
Custodian six (6) Business Days prior to the initial Borrowing Date hereunder
and three (3) Business Days prior to any subsequent Borrowing Date hereunder a
Notice of Pledge and each item listed in the definition of Receivable File with
respect to the Receivables being Pledged hereunder on such Borrowing Date.

          (q) The Borrower shall deliver to the Agent on each Purchase Date a
copy of the Assignment delivered to it on such Purchase Date.

          (r) Each of the Servicer (and, if the Servicer is not FCC or an
Affiliate thereof, upon the Servicer gaining knowledge thereof) and the Borrower
shall promptly notify the Agent of the occurrence of any Servicer Default, Event
of Default or Early Amortization Event.

          (s) Each of the Servicer and the Borrower shall, at their expense,
cooperate and take all actions reasonably requested by the Agent in connection
with obtaining a shadow rating with respect to the financing facility provided
for hereunder, including, without limitation providing to each of the Rating
Agencies all information requested by such Rating Agencies.

                                       51

          (t) The Borrower shall (i) on or prior to the nine month anniversary
from the date hereof, deliver to the Agent an Opinion of Counsel, addressed and
acceptable to the Agent, stating that the Borrower has obtained all licenses and
permits necessary with respect to the ownership of the Receivables, Related
Rights and Other Conveyed Property by the Borrower and the performance of its
obligations contemplated herein and (ii) after the nine month anniversary from
the date hereof and prior to the Conveyance under the Purchase and Contribution
Agreement of any Receivables originated in any states which were not addressed
in the aforementioned opinion, deliver to the Agent an Opinion of Counsel with
respect to such states, addressed and acceptable to the Agent, stating (x) that
the Borrower has obtained all licenses and permits necessary with respect to the
ownership of such Receivables, Related Rights and Other Conveyed Property by the
Borrower and the performance of its obligations of the transactions contemplated
herein, (y) that FCC has obtained all licenses and permits necessary with
respect to the ownership of such Receivables, Related Rights and Other Conveyed
Property by FCC and the performance of its obligations contemplated herein and
(z) stating that the Agent and the Lender are exempt from federal, state and
local licensing and permit requirements with respect to the transaction
contemplated herein.

          (u) (i) The Borrower shall obtain, and shall take all actions
necessary to maintain, all licenses and permits necessary to own its assets and
to transact the business in which it is engaged in the Required States, and (ii)
the Servicer shall obtain, and shall take all actions necessary to maintain, all
licenses and permits necessary to own its assets and to transact the business in
which it is engaged, with the understanding that the Borrower and the Servicer
each hereby agree that, in the event that each of the licenses applied for by
either of them in the States of Connecticut, Georgia, Indiana, Missouri, New
Hampshire, New York and Tennessee (collectively, the "Application States") have
not been received within forty-five (45) days after the date hereof, any
Receivables relating to Obligors located in any of the Application States for
which such license has not been received, will not be Eligible Receivables
hereunder, until such time as such license has been received..

                                   ARTICLE VI.

                 ADMINISTRATION AND SERVICING; CERTAIN COVENANTS

          SECTION 6.01 Appointment and Designation of the Servicer. (a) The
Borrower, the Lender and the Agent hereby appoint the Person designated by the
Agent from time to time (with the approval of the Lender), pursuant to this
Section 6.01 (the "Servicer"), as their agent to service, administer and collect
the Pledged Receivables and otherwise to enforce their respective rights and
interests in and under the Pledged Receivables and the other Pledged Assets. The
Servicer shall collect such Pledged Receivables under the conditions referred to
above by means of the collection procedures as set forth in the Credit and
Collection Policy, to the extent consistent with the provisions of this Article
VI. Unless otherwise specified by the Borrower, the Servicer's authorization
under this Agreement shall terminate on the Collection Date. Until the Agent
gives notice to the Borrower of a designation of a new Servicer upon the
occurrence and during the continuance of any Servicer Default, or consents in
writing to the appointment by the Borrower of a

                                       52

<PAGE>

new Servicer, FCC is hereby designated as, and hereby agrees to perform the
duties and obligations of, the Servicer, pursuant to the terms hereof at all
times until the earlier of the Agent's designation of a new Servicer (upon the
occurrence and during the continuance of any Servicer Default), the delivery by
the Agent of its written consent to the appointment by the Borrower of a new
Servicer or the Collection Date. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance
of any Servicer Default, the Agent may at any time (with the approval of the
Lender) designate as Servicer any Person to succeed FCC or any successor
Servicer, on the condition in each case that any such Person so designated shall
agree to perform the duties and obligations of the Servicer pursuant to the
terms hereof. Each of the Borrower and FCC hereby grants to any successor
Servicer an irrevocable power of attorney to take any and all steps in the
Borrower's, FCC's or the Servicer's name, as applicable, and on behalf of the
Borrower or FCC, necessary or desirable, in the determination of such successor
Servicer, to service, administer or collect any and all Pledged Receivables.

          (b) The Servicer is hereby authorized to act for the Borrower and the
Agent and, in such capacity, shall manage, service, administer and make
collections on the Pledged Receivables and perform the other actions required by
the Servicer under this Agreement for the benefit of the Agent and the Lender.
The Servicer agrees that its servicing of the Pledged Receivables shall be
carried out in accordance with customary and usual procedures of institutions
which service home improvement contracts and receivables and, to the extent more
exacting, the degree of skill and attention that the Servicer exercises from
time to time, with respect to all comparable home improvement contracts and
receivables that it services for itself or others (or that it formerly serviced
for itself or others) in accordance with the Credit and Collection Policy (or if
the Back-Up Servicer has been appointed as Servicer, the Back-Up Servicer's
customary collection policies) and, to the extent more exacting, the
requirements of this Article VI. The Servicer's duties shall include, without
limitation, collecting and posting of all Collections, responding to inquiries
of Obligors on the Pledged Receivables, investigating delinquencies, sending
invoices, payment statements or payment books to Obligors, reporting any
required tax information to Obligors, policing the Underlying Collateral,
enforcing the terms of the Contracts (and any documents related thereto) related
to any Pledged Receivables, complying with the terms of the Lockbox Agreement,
accounting for Collections, furnishing monthly and annual statements to the
Agent with respect to distributions and performing the other duties specified
herein.

          (c) To the extent consistent with the standards, policies and
procedures otherwise required hereby, the Servicer shall have full power and
authority, acting alone, to do any and all things in connection with such
managing, servicing, administration and collection that it may deem necessary or
desirable. The Servicer is authorized to release liens on Underlying Collateral
in order to collect insurance proceeds with respect thereto and to liquidate
such Underlying Collateral in accordance with its customary standards, policies
and procedures; provided, however, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Servicer shall not, (i) except pursuant to an order from a court of competent
jurisdiction, release an Obligor from payment of any unpaid amount under any
Pledged Receivable or (ii) waive the right to collect the unpaid balance of any
Pledged Receivable from such Obligor, except that, subject to Section 6.02(a),
the Servicer may forego collection efforts if the amount which the Servicer, in
its reasonable judgment, expects to realize in connection with such collection
efforts is determined by the Servicer, in its reasonable judgment, to be less
than the reasonably expected costs of pursuing such collection efforts and if
the Servicer would forego such

                                       53

<PAGE>

collection efforts in accordance with its customary procedures. The Servicer is
hereby authorized to commence, in its own name (in its capacity as Servicer), if
possible, or in the name of the Borrower, the Agent or the Lender (provided that
if the Servicer is acting in the name of the Borrower, the Agent or the Lender,
the Servicer shall have obtained the Borrower's, the Agent's or the Lender's
consent, as the case may be, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld),
a legal proceeding to enforce any Pledged Receivable (or any terms or provisions
of the related Contract) or to commence or participate in any other legal
proceeding (including, without limitation, a bankruptcy proceeding) relating to
or involving a Pledged Receivable or any related Contract, Obligor or Underlying
Collateral. If the Servicer commences or participates in such a legal proceeding
in its own name, the Borrower, the Agent or the Lender, as the case may be,
shall thereupon be deemed to have automatically assigned such Pledged Receivable
to the Servicer solely for purposes of commencing or participating in any such
proceeding as a party or claimant, and the Servicer is authorized and empowered
by the Borrower, the Agent or the Lender, as the case may be, to execute and
deliver in the Servicer's name any notices, demands, claims, complaints,
responses, affidavits or other documents or instruments in connection with any
such proceeding. The Borrower, the Agent or the Lender, as the case may be,
shall furnish the Servicer with any powers of attorney and other documents which
the Servicer may reasonably request in writing and which the Servicer deems
necessary or appropriate and take any other steps which the Servicer may deem
necessary or appropriate to enable the Servicer to carry out its servicing and
administrative duties under this Agreement. If, however, in any suit or legal
proceeding it is held that the Servicer may not prosecute such suit or legal
proceeding on the grounds that it is not an actual party in interest or a holder
entitled to enforce such suit or legal proceeding, the Borrower shall take such
steps as the Servicer deems necessary to prosecute such suit or legal
proceeding, including bringing suit in its name.

          SECTION 6.02 Collection of Receivable Payments; Modification and
Amendment of Receivables. (a) Consistent with and subject to the standards,
policies and procedures required by this Agreement, the Servicer shall collect
all payments called for under the terms and provisions of the Contracts related
to the Pledged Receivables (and the terms and provisions of any documents
related thereto) as and when the same shall become due and shall follow such
collection procedures with respect to the Pledged Receivables and the related
Contracts and insurance policies as will, in the reasonable judgment of the
Servicer, maximize the amount to be received by the Borrower and the Lender with
respect thereto.

          (b) The Servicer may not grant payment extensions or deferments on any
such Contract or permit any other modifications or amendments to any such
Contract (except to the extent that the effect of such payment extensions or
deferments or modifications or amendments with respect to any such Contract does
not have an adverse effect on the value, collectibility or credit risk
associated with any such Pledged Receivable related to such Contract); provided,
that if an Obligor payment falls due on any day which is not a Business Day, the
Servicer may grant a payment extension to the next Business Day.

          (c) The Servicer shall remit all Collections received directly by the
Servicer to the Collection Account, without deposit into any intervening account
as soon as practicable, but in no event later than the end of the next business
on the Business Day of receipt thereof.

                                       54

<PAGE>

          SECTION 6.03 Realization Upon Receivables. Consistent with the
standards, policies and procedures required by this Agreement, the Servicer
shall, in accordance with the Servicer's customary policies and procedures and
the Credit and Collection Policy, use its best efforts to collect on, foreclose
upon (or otherwise comparably convert the ownership of) or liquidate any
Underlying Collateral securing a Pledged Receivable within 10 days of an uncured
failure of the related Obligor to make any payment which it is obligated to make
under the related Contract or an earlier date that would be customary under the
circumstances involved and, in any case, in a manner as will, in the reasonable
judgment of the Servicer, maximize the amount to be received by the Borrower and
the Lender with respect thereto; provided, however, that the Servicer need not
foreclose upon (or otherwise comparably convert the ownership of) and liquidate
the Underlying Collateral securing such a Pledged Receivable if, in the
reasonable opinion of the Servicer, (a) such action would not be in the best
interests of the Borrower and the Lender with respect thereto, or (b) the value
of such Underlying Collateral does not exceed by more than an insignificant
amount the cost to foreclose upon (or otherwise comparably convert the ownership
of) and liquidate such Underlying Collateral. The Servicer is further authorized
to follow such customary practices and procedures as it shall deem necessary or
advisable, consistent with the standard of care required by Section 6.01, which
practices and procedures may include reasonable efforts to realize upon any
guaranties, selling the related Underlying Collateral at public or private sale,
the submission of claims under an Insurance Policy and other actions by the
Servicer in order to realize upon such Pledged Receivable. The foregoing is
subject to the provision that, in any case in which the Underlying Collateral
shall have suffered damage, the Servicer shall not expend funds in connection
with any repair or towards the repossession of such Underlying Collateral,
unless it shall determine in its discretion that such repair and/or repossession
shall increase the proceeds of liquidation of the related Pledged Receivable by
an amount greater than the amount of such expenses. All Liquidation Proceeds
shall be remitted directly by the Servicer to the Collection Account without
deposit into any intervening account as soon as practicable, but in no event
later than one (1) Business Day after receipt thereof. The Servicer shall pay on
behalf of the Borrower any taxes assessed on repossessed Underlying Collateral,
and the Servicer shall be entitled to reimbursement of any such tax as a
Servicer Advance.

          SECTION 6.04 [Intentionally Omitted.]

          SECTION 6.05 Maintenance of Security Interests in Underlying
Collateral. (a) The Servicer and the Borrower shall take all steps necessary,
under all applicable law, in order to (i) cause a valid, subsisting and
enforceable first priority perfected security interest to exist in favor of the
Agent (for the benefit of the Lender) in the Borrower's interests in the
Underlying Collateral, all Other Conveyed Property and all Related Security
related to each Receivable (and the proceeds thereof) being Pledged hereunder,
to secure a Loan on the Borrowing Date thereof including the filing of a UCC
financing statement in the applicable jurisdiction adequately describing the
Underlying Collateral, Other Conveyed Property and all Related Security and
naming the Borrower as debtor and the Agent as the secured party, (ii) ensure
that such security interest is and shall be prior to all other liens upon and
security interests in the Borrower's interests in such Underlying Collateral,
Other Conveyed Property and Related Security (and the proceeds thereof) that now
exist, or may hereafter arise or be created other than Permitted Liens, and
(iii) ensure that

                                       55

<PAGE>

immediately prior to the Pledge of such Receivable by the Borrower to the Agent
(for the benefit of the Lender), such Underlying Collateral, Other Conveyed
Property and Related Security is free and clear of all Adverse Claims other than
Permitted Liens; and

          (b) The Servicer shall take all steps, as are necessary (subject to
Section 6.05(a)), to maintain perfection of the security interest in the
Borrower's interests in the Underlying Collateral, Other Conveyed Property and
Related Security related to each Pledged Receivable (and the proceeds thereof)
in favor of the Agent, for the benefit of the Lender, including but not limited
to, obtaining the execution by the Borrower and the recording, registering,
filing, rerecording, refiling, and reregistering of all security agreements,
financing statements and continuation statements as are necessary to maintain
and/or perfect such security interests granted by the Borrower and the
recordation of the Agent's lien on such Underlying Collateral. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, the Borrower and the Agent each hereby
authorizes the Servicer, and the Servicer agrees, to take any and all steps
necessary (subject to Section 6.05(a)) to re-perfect the security interest in
the Borrower's interests in any Underlying Collateral (and the Borrower's
interests therein), Other Conveyed Property and Related Security related to each
Pledged Receivable (and the proceeds thereof) in favor of the Agent, for the
benefit of the Lender, as may be necessary, due to the relocation of such
Underlying Collateral or for any other reason.

          (c) [Intentionally Omitted.]

          SECTION 6.06 Pledged Receivable Receipts. The Servicer shall make a
deposit into the Collection Account in an amount equal to the Collections
received, or made by, or on behalf of it, within one Business Day of such
Collections being received, or made by, or on behalf of it.

          SECTION 6.07 [Intentionally Omitted.]

          SECTION 6.08 Unidentified Payments; Lender's Right of Presumption. The
Borrower agrees and consents that the Servicer and/or the Agent may apply any
payment it receives (or any such payment the Servicer deposits into the
Collection Account) from an Obligor to any Loan secured by a Pledged Receivable
if the Servicer and/or the Agent is unable in good faith to determine whether
such payment from an Obligor relates to such Pledged Receivable.

          SECTION 6.09 No Rights of Withdrawal. Until the Collection Date, the
Borrower shall have no rights of direction (except with respect to Permitted
Investments as set forth herein) or withdrawal with respect to amounts held in
the Collection Account or the Lockbox Account, except with respect to funds not
related to any Pledged Assets, which were incorrectly deposited into any such
account.

          SECTION 6.10 Permitted Investments. The Borrower shall, pursuant to
written instruction, direct the Agent's Bank (and if the Borrower fails to do
so, the Agent may, pursuant to written instruction, direct the Agent's Bank) to
invest, or cause the investment of, funds on deposit in the Collection Account
in Permitted Investments, from the date of this Agreement until the Collection
Date. Absent any such written instruction, the Agent's Bank shall invest, or

                                       56

<PAGE>

cause the investment of, such funds in Permitted Investments described in clause
(v) of the definition thereof. A Permitted Investment acquired with funds
deposited in the Collection Account shall mature not later than the Business Day
immediately preceding any Remittance Date, and shall not be sold or disposed of
prior to its maturity. All such Permitted Investments shall be registered in the
name of the Securities Intermediary (as defined in the Securities Account
Agreement) or its nominee for the benefit of the Lender, and otherwise comply
with assumptions of the legal opinion of counsel for the Agent's Bank dated the
date hereof, delivered in connection with this Agreement. All income and gain
realized from any such investment, as well as any interest earned on deposits in
the Collection Account, shall be distributed in accordance with the provisions
of Article II hereof. The Borrower shall deposit in the Collection Account, as
the case may be (with respect to investments made hereunder of funds held
therein), an amount equal to the amount of any actual loss incurred, in respect
of any such investment, immediately upon realization of such loss. None of the
Agent's Bank or the Agent shall be liable for the amount of any loss incurred,
in respect of any investment, or lack of investment, of funds held in the
Collection Account.

          SECTION 6.11 Servicing Compensation. As compensation for its
activities hereunder, the Servicer shall be entitled to be paid the Servicing
Fee from the Collection Account as provided in Section 2.05(c). The Servicer
shall be required to pay all expenses incurred by it in connection with its
servicing activities hereunder and shall not be entitled to reimbursement
therefor, except with respect to reasonable expenses of the Servicer incurred in
connection with the repossession and disposition of any Underlying Collateral
(which the Servicer may retain from the proceeds of the disposition of such
Underlying Collateral) and any Servicer Advances made by the Servicer pursuant
hereto. The Servicing Fee may not be transferred in whole, or in part, except in
connection with the transfer of all the Servicer's responsibilities and
obligations under this Agreement.

          SECTION 6.12 Reports to the Agent; Account Statements; Servicing
Information. (a) The Borrower will deliver to the Agent, (i) on the Early
Amortization Commencement Date, a report identifying the Pledged Receivables
(and any information with respect thereto requested by the Agent) on the day
immediately preceding the Early Amortization Commencement Date, and (ii) upon
the Agent's reasonable request and upon reasonable notice, on any other Business
Day, a report identifying the Pledged Receivables (and any information with
respect thereto, reasonably requested by the Agent) as of such day.

          (b) At least five (5) Business Days prior to each Remittance Date, the
Servicer shall prepare and deliver, or have delivered to the Agent for the
Lender, (i) a Monthly Remittance Report and any other information reasonably
requested by the Agent, relating to all Pledged Receivables (including, if
requested, a Computer Tape or Listing), all information in the Monthly
Remittance Report and all other such information to be accurate as of the last
day of the immediately preceding Remittance Period, and (ii) in an electronic
format mutually acceptable to the Servicer and the Agent, all information
reasonably requested by the Agent relating to all Pledged Receivables. If any
Monthly Remittance Report indicates the existence of a Borrowing Base
Deficiency, the Borrower shall, on the date of delivery of such Monthly
Remittance Report, prepay to the Agent, for the account of the Lender, a portion
of the Loans or Pledge additional Eligible

                                       57

<PAGE>

Receivables, in either case, as is necessary to cure such Borrowing Base
Deficiency (or otherwise cure such Borrowing Base Deficiency).

          (c) By no later than 1:00 P.M. (New York City time) on the Business
Day immediately preceding a Borrowing, the Borrower shall also prepare and
deliver to the Agent for the Lender a Borrowing Base Certificate signed by the
chief financial officer of the Borrower containing information accurate as of
the date of delivery of such Borrowing Base Certificate. If any Borrowing Base
Certificate indicates the existence of a Borrowing Base Deficiency, the Borrower
shall on the date of delivery of such Borrowing Base Certificate prepay to the
Agent, for the account of the Lender, a portion of the Loans or Pledge
additional Eligible Receivables, in either case, as is necessary to cure such
Borrowing Base Deficiency (or otherwise cure such Borrowing Base Deficiency).

          SECTION 6.14 Access to Certain Documentation; Obligors. (a) The Lender
or the Agent (and their respective agents or professional advisors) shall at the
expense of the Borrower, have the right under this Agreement, once during each
calendar quarter, upon reasonable prior notice to the Servicer, to examine and
audit, during business hours or at such other times as might be reasonable under
applicable circumstances, any and all of the books, records, financial
statements or other information of the Servicer and/or the Borrower, or held by
another for the Servicer or the Borrower or on its behalf, concerning this
Agreement, provided, that the Borrower shall not be responsible for the expenses
of the Agent and the Lender to the extent that such expenses exceed $25,000 in
the aggregate in any calendar year. The Lender or the Agent (and their
respective agents or professional advisors) shall at the expense of the Borrower
and as frequently as the Lender or the Agent may desire, have the right under
this Agreement after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of
Default, upon reasonable prior notice to the Servicer, to examine and audit,
during business hours or at such other times as might be reasonable under
applicable circumstances, any and all of the books, records or other information
of the Servicer or the Borrower, or held by another for the Servicer or the
Borrower or on its behalf, concerning this Agreement. The Lender and the Agent
(and their respective agents and professional advisors) shall treat as
confidential any information obtained during the aforementioned examinations
which is not already publicly known or available; provided, however, that the
Lender or the Agent may disclose such information if required to do so by law or
by any regulatory authority.

          (b) The Lender or the Agent (and their respective agents or
professional advisors) shall, at their own expense, have the right under this
Agreement to, not more frequently than once each calendar quarter, contact a
reasonable number of Obligors with respect to any Receivables which are Pledged
hereunder in order to procure such information related to such Obligor, the
related Contract and the Receivables as the Lender or the Agent deems reasonable
under the circumstances. The Servicer and the Borrower hereby agree to cooperate
with the Lender and the Agent (and their respective agents or professional
advisors) in connection with any attempt thereby to contact any such Obligor and
shall provide to the Lender and the Agent such information as is

                                       62

<PAGE>

needed in order to facilitate such contact. The Lender and the Agent (and their
respective agents and professional advisors) shall treat as confidential any
information obtained during any such contact with any such Obligor which is not
already publicly known or available; provided, however, that the Lender or the
Agent (and their respective agents or professional advisors) may disclose such
information if required to do so by law or by any regulatory authority.

          SECTION 6.15 Back-Up Servicer. If a Servicer Default shall occur and
is continuing, then the Agent may, by notice to the Servicer, the Borrower and
the Back-Up Servicer, terminate all of the rights and obligations of the
Servicer under this Agreement. Upon the delivery to the Servicer of such notice,
all authority and power of the Servicer under this Agreement, whether with
respect to the Pledged Assets or otherwise, shall pass to and be vested in the
Back-Up Servicer pursuant to and under this Section (unless the Agent shall have
appointed a different successor Servicer pursuant to Section 6.01 hereof or the
Back-Up Servicer is unable to act as Servicer and a successor is appointed as
provided in the fourth paragraph of this Section 6.15), and, without limitation,
the Back-Up Servicer is hereby authorized and empowered to execute and deliver,
on behalf of the Servicer, as attorney-in-fact or otherwise, any and all
documents and other instruments, and to do or accomplish all other acts or
things necessary or appropriate to effect the purposes of such notice of
termination or to perform the duties of the Servicer under this Agreement. The
Servicer agrees to cooperate with the Agent and the Back-Up Servicer in
effecting the termination of the Servicer's responsibilities and rights
hereunder, including, without limitation, providing notification to the Obligors
of the assignment of the servicing function, providing the Back-Up Servicer with
all records, in electronic or other form, reasonably requested by it to enable
the Back- Up Servicer to assume the servicing functions hereunder and the
transfer to the Back-Up Servicer for administration by it of all cash amounts
which at the time should be or should have been deposited by the Servicer in the
Collection Account or thereafter be received by the Servicer with respect to the
Pledged Receivables. Neither the Agent nor the Back-Up Servicer shall be deemed
to have breached any obligation hereunder as a result of a failure to make or
delay in making any distribution as and when required hereunder caused by the
failure of the Servicer to remit any amounts received by it or to deliver any
documents held by it with respect to the Pledged Assets.

          The Active Back-Up Servicer's Fees and Transition Costs shall be paid
out of Collections as set forth in Section 2.05(c) on and after the date, if
any, that the Back-Up Servicer assumes the responsibilities of the Servicer
pursuant to this Section. The Standby Back-Up Servicer's Fees and Transition
Costs shall be paid out of Collections as set forth in Section 2.05(c) prior to
the date, if any, that the Back-Up Servicer assumes the responsibilities of the
Servicer pursuant to this Section.

          Any obligations of FCC under any Transaction Document other than in
its capacity as Servicer shall continue in effect notwithstanding FCC's
termination as Servicer.

          On and after the time the Servicer receives a notice of termination
pursuant to this Section 6.15, the Back-Up Servicer shall be (and the Back-Up
Servicer hereby agrees to be) the successor in all respects to the Servicer in
its capacity as Servicer under this Agreement and the transactions set forth or
provided for herein and shall have all the rights and powers and be subject
thereafter to all the responsibilities, duties and liabilities relating thereto
placed on the Servicer by

                                       63

<PAGE>

the terms and provisions hereof; provided, however, that any failure to perform
such duties or responsibilities caused by the Servicer's failure to provide
information required by this Section 6.15 shall not be considered a default by
the Back-Up Servicer hereunder; provided, further, however, that the Back-Up
Servicer, as successor Servicer, shall have (i) no liability with respect to any
obligation which was required to be performed by the terminated Servicer prior
to the date that the Back-Up Servicer becomes the successor to the Servicer or
any claim of a third party based on any alleged action or inaction of the
terminated Servicer, (ii) no obligation to perform any repurchase or advancing
obligations, if any, of the Servicer, (iii) no obligation to pay any taxes
required to be paid by the Servicer (provided that the Back-Up Servicer shall
pay any income taxes for which it is liable), (iv) no obligation to pay any of
the fees and expenses of any other party to the transactions contemplated
hereby, and (v) no liability or obligation with respect to any Servicer
indemnification obligations of any prior Servicer, including the original
Servicer. The indemnification obligations of the Back-Up Servicer, upon becoming
a successor Servicer, are expressly limited to those arising on account of its
failure to act in good faith and with reasonable care under the circumstances.
In addition, the Back-Up Servicer shall have no liability relating to the
representations and warranties of the Servicer contained in Article IV.
Notwithstanding the above, the Agent may, if the Back-Up Servicer shall be
unwilling to so act, or shall, if the Back-Up Servicer is unable to so act, or
if the Lender so requests in writing to the Agent, appoint itself, or appoint
any established servicing institution having a net worth of not less than
$50,000,000, as the successor to the Servicer hereunder in the assumption of all
or any part of the responsibilities, duties or liabilities of the Servicer
hereunder. Pending appointment of a successor to the Servicer hereunder, and
after the Agent notifies the Servicer to discontinue performing servicing
functions under this Agreement, the Back-Up Servicer (or the Agent if there is
no Back-Up Servicer) shall act in such capacity as hereinabove provided. In
connection with such appointment and assumption, the Agent may make such
arrangements for the compensation of such successor out of payments on Pledged
Receivables as it and such successor shall agree; provided, however, that,
except as provided herein, no such compensation shall be in excess of that
permitted the Servicer hereunder, unless (i) agreed to by the Lender and (ii)
such compensation shall be on commercially competitive terms and rates. The
Borrower, the Agent and such successor shall take such action, consistent with
this Agreement, as shall be necessary to effectuate any such succession.

          Prior to each Remittance Date, provided that the Back-Up Servicer
shall have received the information specified in Section 6.12(e) within the time
specified therein, the Back-Up Servicer shall compare the information on the
computer tape or diskette (or other means of electronic transmission acceptable
to the Back-Up Servicer) most recently delivered to the Back-Up Servicer by the
Servicer pursuant to Section 6.12(e) with respect to such Remittance Date to the
corresponding Monthly Remittance Report delivered to the Back-Up Servicer by the
Servicer pursuant to Section 6.12(e) and shall:

          (a) confirm that such Monthly Remittance Report is complete on its
     face;

          (b) confirm the distributions to be made on such Remittance Date
     pursuant to Section 2.05(c) hereof to the extent the Back-Up Servicer is
     able to do so given the information provided to it by the Servicer (it
     being hereby agreed that the Back-Up Servicer shall promptly notify the
     Servicer and the Agent if such information is insufficient and that

                                       64

<PAGE>

     the Servicer shall promptly provide to the Back-Up Servicer any additional
     information required by the Back-Up Servicer);

          (c) confirm the following information on such Monthly Remittance
     Report: (i) Eligible Receivables Balance, (ii) the Delinquency Rate, (iii)
     the Annualized Default Rate, and (iv) the Overconcentration Amount;

          (d) confirm such other information as the Back-Up Servicer and the
     Agent may agree; and

          (e) at least two (2) Business Days prior to such Remittance Date,
     provide written notice to the Agent, in form and substance satisfactory to
     the Agent, that the confirmations described in clauses (a) through (d)
     above have been completed;

          In the event of any discrepancy between the information set forth in
subparagraphs (b) or (c) above as calculated by the Servicer and that determined
or calculated by the Back-Up Servicer, the Back-Up Servicer shall promptly
report such discrepancy to the Servicer and the Agent. In the event of a
discrepancy as described in the preceding sentence, the Servicer and the Back-Up
Servicer shall attempt to reconcile such discrepancy prior to the related
Remittance Date, but in the absence of a reconciliation, distributions on the
related Remittance Date shall be made consistent with the information calculated
by the Servicer, the Servicer and the Back-Up Servicer shall attempt to
reconcile such discrepancy prior to the next Remittance Date, and the Servicer
shall promptly report to the Agent regarding the progress, if any, which shall
have been made in reconciling such discrepancy. If the Back-Up Servicer and the
Servicer are unable to reconcile such discrepancy with respect to such Monthly
Remittance Report by the next Remittance Date, the Servicer shall cause
independent accountants acceptable to the Agent, at the Servicer's expense, to
examine such Monthly Remittance Report and attempt to reconcile such discrepancy
at the earliest possible date (and the Servicer shall promptly provide the Agent
with a report regarding such event). The effect, if any, of such reconciliation
shall be reflected in the Monthly Remittance Report for the next succeeding
Remittance Date.

          Other than as specifically set forth in this Agreement, the Back-Up
Servicer shall have no obligation to supervise, verify, monitor or administer
the performance of the Servicer and shall have no liability for any action taken
or omitted by the Servicer.

          The Back-Up Servicer may allow a subservicer to perform any and all of
its duties and responsibilities hereunder, including but not limited to its
duties as successor Servicer hereunder, should the Back-Up Servicer become the
successor Servicer pursuant to the terms of this Agreement; provided, however,
that the Back-Up Servicer shall remain liable for the performance of all of its
duties and obligations hereunder to the same extent as if no such subservicing
had occurred.

          SECTION 6.16 Additional Remedies of Agent Upon Event of Default.
During the continuance of any Event of Default, the Agent, in addition to the
rights specified in Section 7.01, shall have the right, in its own name and as
agent for the Lender, to take all actions now

                                       65

<PAGE>

or hereafter existing at law, in equity or by statute to enforce its rights and
remedies and to protect the interests, and enforce the rights and remedies, of
the Lender (including the institution and prosecution of all judicial,
administrative and other proceedings and the filings of proofs of claim and debt
in connection therewith). Except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement, no remedy provided for by this Agreement shall be exclusive of any
other remedy, each and every remedy shall be cumulative and in addition to any
other remedy, and no delay or omission to exercise any right or remedy shall
impair any such right or remedy or shall be deemed to be a waiver of any Event
of Default.

          SECTION 6.17 Waiver of Defaults. Upon consent of the Lender, the Agent
may waive any default by the Servicer in the performance of its obligations
hereunder and its consequences. Upon any such waiver of a past default, such
default shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall
be deemed to have been remedied for every purpose of this Agreement. No such
waiver shall be effective unless it shall be in writing and signed by the Agent
on the Lender's behalf and no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or
other default or impair any right consequent thereon except to the extent
expressly so waived.

          SECTION 6.18 Maintenance of Certain Insurance. From the period
commencing on February 11, 2003 until the termination of the Servicer's duties
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the Servicer shall maintain in force an
"errors and omissions" and an employee fidelity insurance policy, in each case,
(i) in an amount not less than $1,000,000, (ii) in a form reasonably acceptable
to the Lender and the Agent, in any case, that would cover any loss of
Collections by the Servicer hereunder caused by employee dishonesty, (iii) with
an insurance company reasonably acceptable to the Lender and the Agent and (iv)
naming the Agent as loss payee. Unless otherwise directed by the Agent and the
Lender, the Servicer shall prepare and present, on behalf of itself, the Agent
and the Lender, claims under any such policy in a timely fashion in accordance
with the terms of such policy, and upon the filing of any claim on any policy
described in this Section, the Servicer shall promptly notify the Agent of such
claim and deposit the proceeds of any such claim into the Collection Account.
The Servicer shall deliver copies of such policies to the Agent on or prior to
February 11, 2003 together with a certification from the applicable insurance
company that such policy is in force on such date. The Servicer shall deliver
proof of maintenance of such policies, in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to the Agent, on the six month anniversary from February 11, 2003 and
on each succeeding six month anniversary thereafter (or if such day is not a
Business Day, the next succeeding Business Day).

          SECTION 6.19 Segregation of Collections. The Servicer shall not
commingle funds constituting Collections with any other funds of the Servicer.

          SECTION 6.20 UCC Matters; Protection and Perfection of Pledged Assets.
The Borrower will not change the jurisdiction of its incorporation or make any
change to its corporate name or use any tradenames, fictitious names, assumed
names, "doing business as" names or other names (other than those listed on
Schedule II hereto, as such schedule may be revised from time to time to reflect
name changes and name usage permitted under the terms of this Section 6.20 after
compliance with all terms and conditions of this Section 6.20 related thereto)
unless, prior to the effective date of any such name change or use, the Borrower
notifies the Agent of such change

                                       66

<PAGE>

in writing and delivers to the Agent such financing statements as the Agent may
request to reflect such name change or use, together with such other documents
and instruments as the Agent may request in connection therewith. The Borrower
will not change the location of its chief executive office or the location of
its records regarding the Pledged Receivables unless, prior to the effective
date of any such change of location, the Borrower notifies the Agent of such
change of location in writing and delivers to the Agent such documents and
instruments as the Agent may request in connection therewith. The Borrower
agrees that from time to time, at its expense, it will promptly execute and
deliver all further instruments and documents, and take all further action that
the Agent may reasonably request in order to perfect, protect or more fully
evidence the Lender's interest in the Pledged Assets acquired hereunder, or to
enable the Lender or the Agent to exercise or enforce any of their respective
rights hereunder. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Borrower
will, upon the request of the Agent: (i) execute (if necessary) and file such
financing or continuation statements, or amendments thereto or assignments
thereof, and such other instruments or notices, as may be necessary or
appropriate or as the Agent may request, and (ii) mark its master data
processing records evidencing such Pledged Receivables with a legend acceptable
to the Agent, evidencing that the Lender has acquired an interest therein as
provided in this Agreement. The Agent shall be entitled to conclusively rely on
the filings or registrations made by or on behalf of the Borrower without any
independent investigation and the Borrower's obligation to make such filings as
evidence that such filings have been made. The Borrower hereby authorizes the
Agent to file one or more financing or continuation statements, and amendments
thereto and assignments thereof, relative to all or any of the Pledged
Receivables and the Other Conveyed Property and the Related Security related
thereto and the proceeds of the foregoing now existing or hereafter arising,
without the signature of the Borrower where permitted by law. The Borrower
hereby ratifies and authorizes the filing by the Agent of any such financing
statement made prior to the date hereof. A carbon, photographic or other
reproduction of this Agreement or any financing statement covering the Pledged
Receivables, or any part thereof, shall be sufficient as a financing statement.
The Borrower shall, upon the request of the Agent at any time after the
occurrence of an Event of Default and at the Borrower's expense, notify the
Obligors obligated to pay any Pledged Receivables, or any of them, of the
security interest of the Lender in the Pledged Assets. If the Borrower fails to
perform any of its agreements or obligations under this Section 6.20, the Agent
may (but shall not be required to) itself perform, or cause performance of, such
agreement or obligation, and the expenses of the Agent incurred in connection
therewith shall be payable by the Borrower upon the Agent's demand therefor. For
purposes of enabling the Agent to exercise its rights described in the preceding
sentence and elsewhere in this Article VI, the Borrower and the Lender hereby
authorize each of the Agent and its successors and assigns to take any and all
steps in the Borrower's name and on behalf of the Borrower and the Lender
necessary or desirable, in the determination of the Agent, to collect all
amounts due under any and all Pledged Receivables, including, without
limitation, endorsing the Borrower's name on checks and other instruments
representing Collections and enforcing such Pledged Receivables and the related
Contracts and, if any, the related guarantees.

          SECTION 6.21 Servicer Advances. The Servicer may, in its sole
discretion, make an advance in respect of any payment due on a Pledged
Receivable (other than a Defaulted Receivable) to the extent such payment has
not been received by the Servicer as of its due date and the Servicer reasonably
expects such payment will be ultimately recoverable (a "Servicer Advance"). The
Servicer shall deposit into the Collection Account in immediately available
funds

                                       67

<PAGE>

the aggregate of all Servicer Advances to be made during a Remittance Period on
or prior to the Business Day immediately preceding the related Remittance Date.
The Servicer shall be entitled to reimbursement for such Servicer Advances from
monies in the Collection Account as provided in Section 2.05(c) hereof.

          SECTION 6.22 Repurchase of Receivables Upon Breach of Covenant or
Representation and Warranty by Servicer. The Borrower or the Servicer, as the
case may be, shall inform the other parties to this Agreement promptly, in
writing, upon the discovery of any breach of the Servicer's representations,
warranties and/or covenants pursuant to Section 6.05 or Article V; provided,
however, that the failure to provide any such notice shall not diminish, in any
manner whatsoever, any obligation of the Servicer hereunder to repurchase any
Pledged Receivable. Unless such breach shall have been cured by the last day of
the first full calendar month following the discovery by or notice to the
Servicer of such breach (and provided that a Borrowing Base Deficiency exists on
such last day), the Servicer (if FCC or an Affiliate thereof) shall have an
obligation, and the Borrower shall and the Agent may, enforce such obligation of
the Servicer (if FCC or an Affiliate thereof), to repurchase any Pledged
Receivable materially and adversely affected by such breach. The Borrower shall
notify the Agent promptly, in writing, of any failure by the Servicer to so
repurchase any such Pledged Receivable. In consideration of the repurchase of
such Pledged Receivable, the Servicer shall remit funds in an amount equal to
the Release Price for such Pledged Receivable to the Collection Account on the
date of such repurchase. The obligations of the Servicer under this Section 6.22
are in addition to, and in no way limit, any obligations of the Servicer in its
individual capacity under the Purchase and Contribution Agreement. It is
understood and agreed that the obligation of the Servicer to purchase any
Receivables is not intended to, and shall not, constitute a guaranty of the
collectibility or payment of any Receivable which is not collected, not paid or
uncollectible on account of the insolvency, bankruptcy, or financial inability
to pay of the related Obligor.

          SECTION 6.23 Compliance with Applicable Law. The Servicer and the
Borrower shall at all times comply with all requirements of applicable federal,
state and local laws, and regulations thereunder (including, without limitation,
usury laws, the Federal Truth-in-Lending Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act,
the Fair Credit Billing Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair Debt
Collection Practices Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, the Magnuson-Moss
Warranty Act, the Federal Reserve Board's Regulations "B" and "Z", the Soldiers'
and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1940 and state adaptations of the National
Consumer Act and of the Uniform Consumer Credit Code and all other consumer
credit laws and equal credit opportunity and disclosure laws) in the conduct of
its business.

          SECTION 7.01 Events of Default. If any of the following events
("Events of Default") shall occur:

          (a) the occurrence of any Bankruptcy Event with respect to the

          (b) any representation or warranty made or deemed to be made by the
     Borrower or the Servicer (or any of its officers) under or in connection
     with this Agreement (or any remittance report or other information or
     report delivered pursuant hereto) or any other Transaction Document shall
     prove to be false or incorrect in any material respect; provided, however,
     that if any breach described above is cured by the repurchase of
     Receivables pursuant to Article VI of the Purchase and Contribution
     Agreement or by a repayment pursuant to Section 2.17 hereof, such breach
     shall cease to constitute an Event of Default; or

          (c) (i) the Borrower or the Servicer shall fail to perform or observe
     any term, covenant or agreement hereunder or under any other Transaction
     Document in any material respect or (ii) either the Servicer or the
     Borrower shall fail to make any payment or deposit to be made by it when
     due hereunder or under any other Transaction Document; or

          (d) the Borrower, the Servicer or US Home shall fail to pay any
     principal of or premium or interest on any Debt in an amount in excess of
     $250,000, when the same becomes due and payable (whether by scheduled
     maturity, required prepayment, accelera tion, demand or otherwise); or any
     other default under any agreement or instrument relating to any Debt of the
     Borrower, the Servicer or US Home in excess of $250,000 or any other event,
     shall occur if the effect of such default or event is to accelerate, or to
     permit the acceleration of, the maturity of such Debt; or any such Debt
     shall be declared to be due and payable or required to be prepaid (other
     than by a regularly scheduled required prepayment) prior to the stated
     maturity thereof; or

          (e) any Transaction Document, or any material provision thereof, shall
     not be in full force and effect and enforceable in accordance with its
     terms, or the Servicer, the Borrower or any Affiliate of any of the
     foregoing shall so assert in writing; or

          (f) any "errors or omissions" or employee fidelity insurance policy
     required to be maintained by the Servicer under Section 6.18 shall not be
     in full force and effect and enforceable in accordance with its terms, or
     the Servicer or any party to such insurance policy shall so assert in
     writing and any event described in this clause (f) remains unremedied for
     ten (10) days after the occurrence thereof; or

          (g) (i) the Lender shall at any time fail to have a valid, perfected,
     first priority security interest in any of the Pledged Assets or (ii) any
     purchase by the Borrower of a

                                       69

<PAGE>

     Receivable and the Collections, Related Security and Other Conveyed
     Property under the Purchase and Contribution Agreement shall, for any
     reason, cease to create in favor of the Borrower a perfected ownership
     interest in such Receivable and the Collections, Related Security and the
     Other Conveyed Property with respect thereto; provided, however, that if an
     event described in the foregoing clause (i) or (ii) is cured by the
     repurchase of Receivables pursuant to Article VI of the Purchase and
     Contribution Agreement or by a repayment pursuant to Section 2.17 hereof,
     such event shall cease to constitute an Event of Default; or

          (h) a material adverse change shall have occurred in (i) (A) the
     business, financial condition, results of operations or properties of the
     Borrower, the Servicer or US Home, or (B) the ability of the Servicer or
     the Borrower to perform its obligations under any of the Transaction
     Documents to which it is a party; (ii) the validity, collectibility or
     enforceability of the Pledged Receivables; (iii) the practical realization
     by the Agent, for the benefit of the Lender, of the benefits or security
     afforded under any of the Transaction Documents; or (iv) the first priority
     perfected security interest in any of the Pledged Assets; or

          (i) the Borrower's, the Servicer's or US Home's activities are
     terminated for any reason, including any termination thereof by a
     regulatory, tax or accounting body; or

          (j) the occurrence of a Change of Control; or

          (k) the occurrence of a Servicer Default; or

          (l) (i) the Advance Percentage shall at any time be greater than the
     Maximum Advance Percentage and such event shall remain unremedied for two
     (2) Business Days or (ii) the Facility Amount exceeds the lesser of (x) the
     Borrowing Limit or (y) the Capital Limit and such event shall remain
     unremedied for two (2) Business Days; or

          (m) the auditor's opinion accompanying the audited annual financial
     statements of US Home, the Servicer or the Borrower is qualified in any
     manner; or

          (n) any failure shall have occurred on the part of the Borrower or FCC
     to duly observe or perform in any material respect any covenant or
     agreement related to any Purchased Rate Cap or any covenant or agreement
     under the Sinking Fund Agreement; or

          (o) One or more judgments for the payment of money in an aggregate
     amount in excess of $10,000 shall be entered against the Borrower; or

          (p) US Home shall, at any time, permit its Tangible Net Worth to be
     less than $4,500,000;

then the Agent may, by notice to the Borrower, declare the Early Amortization
Commencement Date to have occurred; provided, that, in the case of any event
described in Section 7.01(a) above, the Early Amortization Commencement Date
shall be deemed to have occurred automatically upon

                                       70

<PAGE>

the occurrence of such event. Upon any such declaration or automatic occurrence,
(i) the Borrower shall cease purchasing Receivables from FCC under the Purchase
and Contribution Agreement, (ii) the Lender may cease issuing commercial paper
notes to fund or maintain the Loans hereunder, (iii) the Liquidity/Credit
Enhancement Facility may be drawn upon by the Lender from time to time
thereafter in order to retire the maturing commercial paper notes issued to fund
or maintain the Loans hereunder (and the Loans hereunder, whether maintained by
the amounts so drawn under the Liquidity/Credit Enhancement Facility or
otherwise, shall bear interest at the Default Funding Rate), (iv) at the option
of the Lender in its sole discretion, the Lender may declare the Loans made to
the Borrower hereunder and all Yield and all Fees accrued on such Loans and any
other Obligations to be immediately due and payable (and the Borrower shall pay
such Loans and all such amounts and Obligations immediately), and (v) at the
option of the Lender in its sole discretion, the Agent, on behalf of the Lender,
may direct the Obligors to make all payments under the Pledged Receivables
directly to the Back-Up Servicer, the Agent, the Lender or any lockbox or
account established by any of such parties. In addition, upon any such
declaration or upon any such automatic occurrence, the Agent and the Lender
shall have, in addition to all other rights and remedies under this Agreement or
otherwise, all other rights and remedies provided under the UCC of the
applicable jurisdiction and other applicable laws, which rights shall be
cumulative. If any Event of Default shall have occurred, the Non-CP Rate and the
CP Rate shall be increased to the Default Funding Rate, effective as of the date
of the occurrence of such Event of Default, and shall remain at the Default
Funding Rate.

          SECTION 7.02 Additional Remedies of the Agent. (a) If, (i) upon the
Lender's declaration that the Loans made to the Borrower hereunder are
immediately due and payable pursuant to Section 7.01 or (ii) on the Facility
Maturity Date, the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Loans, all
accrued Fees and Yield and any other Obligations are not immediately paid in
full, then the Agent, in addition to all other rights specified hereunder, shall
have the right, in its own name and as agent for the Lender, to immediately sell
in a commercially reasonable manner and on commercially reasonable terms, in a
recognized market (if one exists) at such price or prices as the Agent may
reasonably deem satisfactory, any or all Pledged Assets and apply the proceeds
thereof to the Obligations. The Borrower has the right to identify and introduce
any proposed bidders to the Agent; provided, however, that the Agent shall not
be obligated to consummate a transaction with such proposed bidders.

          (b) The parties recognize that it may not be possible to sell all of
the Pledged Assets on a particular Business Day, or in a transaction with the
same purchaser, or in the same manner because the market for such Pledged Assets
may not be liquid. Accordingly, the Agent may elect, in its sole discretion, the
time and manner of liquidating any Pledged Assets, and nothing contained herein
shall obligate the Agent to liquidate any Pledged Assets on the date the Lender
declares the Loans made to the Borrower hereunder to be immediately due and
payable pursuant to Section 7.01 or to liquidate all Pledged Assets in the same
manner or on the same Business Day.

          (c) Any amounts received from any sale or liquidation of the Pledged
Assets pursuant to this Section 7.02 in excess of the Obligations will be
returned to the Borrower, its successors or assigns, or to whosoever may be
lawfully entitled to receive the same, or as a court of competent jurisdiction
may otherwise direct.

                                       71

<PAGE>

          (d) The Agent and the Lenders shall have, in addition to all the
rights and remedies provided herein and provided by applicable federal, state,
foreign, and local laws (including, without limitation, the rights and remedies
of a secured party under the Uniform Commercial Code of any applicable state, to
the extent that the Uniform Commercial Code is applicable, and the right to
offset any mutual debt and claim), all rights and remedies available to the
lenders at law, in equity or under any other agreement between the Lender and
the Borrower.

          (e) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, no
remedy provided for by this Agreement shall be exclusive of any other remedy,
each and every remedy shall be cumulative and in addition to any other remedy,
and no delay or omission to exercise any right or remedy shall impair any such
right or remedy or shall be deemed to be a waiver of any Early Amortization
Event or Event of Default.

                                  ARTICLE VIII.

                                 INDEMNIFICATION

          SECTION 8.01 Indemnities by the Borrower. Without limiting any other
rights which the Agent, the Lender, the Back-Up Servicer, the Agent's Bank, the
Custodian or any of their respective Affiliates may have hereunder or under
applicable law, the Borrower hereby agrees to indemnify the Agent, the Lender,
the Back-Up Servicer and each of their respective Affiliates (each, an
"Indemnified Party" for purposes of this Article VIII) from and against any and
all damages, losses, claims, liabilities and related costs and expenses,
including reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements (all of the foregoing
being collectively referred to as "Indemnified Amounts"), awarded against or
incurred by any of them arising out of or as a result of this Agreement or in
respect of any Pledged Assets, excluding, however, Indemnified Amounts to the
extent resulting solely from gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct
on the part of an Indemnified Party. Without limiting the foregoing, the
Borrower shall indemnify each Indemnified Party for Indemnified Amounts relating
to or resulting from any of the following:

          (i) any Pledged Receivable treated as or represented by the Borrower
     to be an Eligible Receivable which is not at the applicable time an
     Eligible Receivable;

          (ii) reliance on any representation or warranty made or deemed made by
     the Borrower or any of its officers under or in connection with this
     Agreement, which shall have been false or incorrect in any material respect
     when made or deemed made or delivered;

          (iii) the failure by the Borrower to comply with any term, provision
     or covenant contained in this Agreement or any agreement executed in
     connection with this Agreement, or with any applicable law, rule or
     regulation with respect to any Pledged Assets, or the nonconformity of any
     Pledged Assets with any such applicable law, rule or regulation;

                                       72

<PAGE>

          (iv) the failure to vest and maintain vested in the Agent, for the
     benefit of the Lender, or to transfer to the Agent, for the benefit of the
     Lender, a first priority perfected security interest in the Receivables
     which are, or are purported to be, Pledged Receivables, together with all
     related Other Conveyed Property, Collections, Related Security and other
     Pledged Assets related thereto (including, without limitation, the
     Borrower's interest in and to any and all Underlying Collateral with
     respect to such Receivables), free and clear of any Adverse Claim whether
     existing at the time of the related Borrowing or at any time thereafter;

          (v) the failure to maintain, as of the close of business on the
     Business Day prior to the Collection Date, a Facility Amount which is less
     than or equal to the lesser of (x) the Borrowing Limit on such Business Day
     and (y) the Capital Limit on such Business Day (provided, that in
     determining the Capital Limit for purposes of this Section 8.01(v), all
     information used in such determination must be accurate as of the date of
     such determination);

          (vi) the failure to file, or any delay in filing, financing statements
     or other similar instruments or documents under the UCC of any applicable
     jurisdiction or other applicable laws with respect to any Receivables which
     are, or are purported to be, Pledged Receivables or the other Pledged
     Assets related thereto, whether at the time of any Borrowing or at any
     subsequent time;

          (vii) any dispute, claim, offset or defense (other than the discharge
     in bankruptcy of an Obligor) to the payment of any Receivable which is, or
     is purported to be, a Pledged Receivable (including, without limitation, a
     defense based on such Receivable (or the Contract evidencing such
     Receivable) not being a legal, valid and binding obligation of such Obligor
     enforceable against it in accordance with its terms);

          (viii) any failure of the Borrower to perform its duties or
     obligations in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement;

          (ix) the failure of the Borrower to pay when due any taxes payable in
     connection with the Pledged Receivables or the Pledged Assets related
     thereto;

          (x) any repayment by the Agent or the Lender of any amount previously
     distributed in payment of Loans or payment of Yield or Fees or any other
     amount due hereunder, in each case which amount the Agent or the Lender
     believes in good faith is required to be repaid;

          (xi) the commingling by the Borrower of Collections of Pledged
     Receivables at any time with other funds;

          (xii) any litigation or proceeding related to this Agreement or the
     use of proceeds of Loans or the Pledged Assets or any third-party
     investigation related to this Agreement or the use of proceeds of Loans or
     the Pledged Assets;

                                       73

<PAGE>

          (xiii) any failure by the Borrower to give reasonably equivalent value
     to FCC in consideration for the transfer by FCC to the Borrower of any
     Receivable or any attempt by any Person to void or otherwise avoid any such
     transfer under any statutory provision or common law or equitable action,
     including, without limitation, any provision of the Bankruptcy Code;

          (xiv) any failure of the Borrower or any of its respective agents or
     representatives to remit to the Collection Account, Collections of Pledged
     Receivables remitted to the Borrower or any such agent or representative;

          (xv) any failure on the part of the Borrower or FCC duly to observe or
     perform in any material respect any covenant or agreement under the Sinking
     Fund Agreement;

          (xvi) the failure at any time of the Borrower to maintain funds in the
     Sinking Fund Account in the amount required under the Sinking Fund Account
     Agreement; and/or

          (xvii) any environmental claims arising in connection with any
     activity on Mortgaged Property constituting Underlying Collateral.

Any amounts subject to the indemnification provisions of this Section 8.01 shall
be paid by the Borrower to the Agent on behalf of the applicable Indemnified
Party within two (2) Business Days following receipt by the Borrower of the
Agent's written demand therefor on behalf of the applicable Indemnified Party
(and the Agent shall pay such amounts to the applicable Indemnified Party
promptly after the receipt by the Agent of such amounts). The Agent, on behalf
of any Indemnified Party making a request for indemnification under this Section
8.01, shall submit to the Borrower a certificate setting forth in reasonable
detail the basis for and the computations of the Indemnified Amounts with
respect to which such indemnification is requested, which certificate shall be
conclusive absent manifest or demonstrable error.

     If the Borrower has made any payments in respect of Indemnified Amounts to
the Agent, on behalf of an Indemnified Party pursuant to this Section 8.01 and
such Indemnified Party thereafter collects any of such amounts from others, such
Indemnified Party will promptly repay such amounts collected to the Borrower,
without interest.

          SECTION 8.02 Indemnities by Servicer. (a) Without limiting any other
rights which any Indemnified Party may have hereunder or under applicable law,
the Servicer (if FCC or one of its Affiliates) hereby agrees to indemnify each
Indemnified Party from and against any and all damages, losses, claims,
liabilities and related costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees
and disbursements) (all of the foregoing being collectively referred to as
"Servicer Indemnified Amounts") suffered or sustained by any Indemnified Party
as a consequence of any of the following, excluding, however, Servicer
Indemnified Amounts resulting solely from any gross negligence, bad faith or
willful misconduct of any Indemnified Party claiming indemnification hereunder:

                                       74

<PAGE>

          (i) the inclusion, in any computations made by it in connection with
     any Borrowing Base Certificate, Monthly Remittance Report or Commercial
     Paper Remittance Report or other report prepared by it hereunder, of any
     Pledged Receivables which were not Eligible Receivables as of the date of
     any such computation;

          (ii) reliance on any representation or warranty made or deemed made by
     the Servicer (if FCC or one of its Affiliates) or any of its officers under
     or in connection with this Agreement, which shall have been false or
     incorrect in any material respect when made or deemed made or delivered;

          (iii) the failure by the Servicer (if FCC or any of its Affiliates) to
     comply with (A) any term, provision or covenant contained in this
     Agreement, or any agreement executed in connection with this Agreement, or
     (B) any applicable law, rule or regulation applicable to it with respect to
     any Pledged Assets;

          (iv) any action or inaction by the Servicer (if FCC or one of its
     Affiliates) that causes the Agent, for the benefit of the Lender, not to
     have a first priority perfected security interest in the Receivables that
     are, or are purported to be, Pledged Receivables, together with all related
     Other Conveyed Property, Collections, Related Security and other Pledged
     Assets related thereto (including without limitation, the Borrower's
     interest in and to any and all Underlying Collateral with respect to such
     Receivables), free and clear of any Adverse Claim whether existing at the
     time of the related Borrowing or any time thereafter;

          (v) the commingling by the Servicer (if FCC or one of its Affiliates)
     of the Collections of Pledged Receivables at any time with any other funds;

          (vi) any failure of the Servicer (if FCC or one of its Affiliates) or
     any of its agents or representatives (including, without limitation,
     agents, representatives and employees of the Servicer acting pursuant to
     authority granted under Section 6.01 hereof) to remit to Collection
     Account, Collections of Pledged Receivables remitted to the Servicer or any
     such agent or representative;

          (vii) the failure by the Servicer (if FCC or any of its Affiliates) to
     perform any of its duties or obligations in accordance with the provisions
     of this Agreement or errors or omissions related to such duties;

          (viii) notwithstanding whether any Pledged Receivable shall have been
     repurchased by the Servicer pursuant to Section 6.22, any of the events or
     facts giving rise to a breach of any of the Servicer's representations,
     warranties, agreements and/or covenants set forth in Article V or Article
     VI; and/or

          (ix) any environmental claims arising in connection with any activity
     on Mortgaged Property constituting Underlying Collateral.

                                       75

          (b) Any Servicer Indemnified Amounts shall be paid by the Servicer (if
FCC or one of its Affiliates) to the Agent, for the benefit of the applicable
Indemnified Party, within two (2) Business Days following receipt by the
Servicer of the Agent's written demand therefor on behalf of the applicable
Indemnified Party (and the Agent shall pay such amounts to the applicable
Indemnified Party promptly after the receipt by the Agent of such amounts). The
Agent, on behalf of any Indemnified Party making a request for indemnification
under this Section 8.02, shall submit to the Servicer a certificate setting
forth in reasonable detail the basis for and the computations of the Indemnified
Amounts with respect to which such indemnification is requested, which
certificate shall be conclusive absent manifest or demonstrable error. Any
Servicer Indemnified Amounts made by the Servicer to any Indemnified Party shall
be reimbursed to the Servicer by such Indemnified Party if a court of competent
jurisdiction makes a final, non-appealable judgement which determines that such
Servicer Indemnified Amounts suffered or sustained by such Indemnified Party
resulted solely from the gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct of
such Indemnified Party.

          (c) If the Servicer has made any indemnity payments to the Agent, on
behalf of an Indemnified Party pursuant to this Section 8.02 and such
Indemnified Party thereafter collects any of such amounts from others, such
Indemnified Party will promptly repay such amounts collected to the Servicer,
without interest.

          Each applicable Indemnified Party shall deliver to the indemnifying
party under Section 8.01 and Section 8.02, within a reasonable time after such
Indemnified Party's receipt thereof, copies of all notices and documents
(including court papers) received by such Indemnified Party relating to the
claim giving rise to the Indemnified Amounts.

                                   ARTICLE IX.

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

          SECTION 9.01 Amendments and Waivers. (a) Except as provided in Sec-
tion 9.01(b), no amendment or modification of any provision of this Agreement
shall be effective without the written agreement of the Borrower, the Servicer,
the Agent and the Lender, and no termination or waiver of any provision of this
Agreement or consent to any departure therefrom by the Borrower or the Servicer
shall be effective without the written concurrence of the Agent and the Lender;
provided, however, that no amendment, termination, waiver or consent referred to
in the preceding sentence shall, unless in writing and signed by the Custodian,
the Back-Up Servicer or the Agent's Bank, as the case may be, in addition to the
Agent and the Lender, affect the rights or duties of the Custodian, the Back-Up
Servicer or the Agent's Bank, as the case may be, under this Agreement. Any
waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the
specific purpose for which given.

          (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 9.01(a), in the event
that there is more than one Lender, the written consent of each Lender shall be
required for any amendment, modification or waiver (i) reducing any outstanding
Loans, or the Yield thereon, (ii) postponing any

                                       76

<PAGE>

date for any payment of any Loan, or the Yield thereon, (iii) modifying the
provisions of this Section 9.01, (iv) increasing the Capital Limit or the
Borrowing Limit or (v) increasing the Maximum Advance Percentage or reducing the
Minimum Overcollateralization Amount.

          SECTION 9.02 Notices, Etc. All notices and other communications
provided for hereunder shall, unless otherwise stated herein, be in writing
(including telex communication, communication by facsimile copy or electronic
mail) and mailed, telexed, transmitted or delivered, as to each party hereto, at
its address set forth under its name on the signature pages hereof or specified
in such party's Assignment and Acceptance or at such other address (including,
without limitation, an electronic mail address) as shall be designated by such
party in a written notice to the other parties hereto. All such notices and
communications shall be effective, upon receipt, or in the case of (i) notice by
mail, five days after being deposited in the United States mails, first class
postage prepaid, (ii) notice by telex, when telexed against receipt of
answerback, or (iii) notice by facsimile copy or electronic mail, when verbal
communication of receipt is obtained, except that notices and communications
pursuant to Article II shall not be effective until received.

          SECTION 9.03 No Waiver; Remedies. No failure on the part of the Agent
or the Lender to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right hereunder shall
operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any
right hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise
of any other right. The remedies herein provided are cumulative and not
exclusive of any remedies provided by law.

          SECTION 9.04 Binding Effect; Assignability; Multiple Lenders. (a) This
Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Borrower, the
Servicer, the Agent, the Lender, the Back-Up Servicer, the Custodian, the
Agent's Bank and their respective successors and permitted assigns. This
Agreement and the Lender's rights and obligations hereunder and interest herein
shall be assignable in whole or in part (including by way of the sale of
participation interests therein) by the Lender and its successors and assigns;
provided, however that (i) the commercial paper issued by any assignee of the
Lender or its successors and assigns shall have a rating from a nationally
recognized rating agency at least equal to the rating of the commercial paper of
the Lender at the time of the applicable assignment and (ii) DZ BANK shall
remain the Agent hereunder after any such assignment. None of the Borrower, the
Servicer or the Back-Up Servicer may assign any of its rights and obligations
hereunder or any interest herein without the prior written consent of the Lender
and the Agent. The parties to each assignment or participation made pursuant to
this Section 9.04 shall execute and deliver to the Agent, for its acceptance and
recording in its books and records, an assignment and acceptance agreement (an
"Assignment and Acceptance") or a participation agreement or other transfer
instrument reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Agent and the
Borrower. Each such assignment or participation shall be effective as of the
date specified in the applicable Assignment and Acceptance or other agreement or
instrument only after the execution, delivery, acceptance and recording thereof
as described in the preceding sentence. The Agent shall notify the Borrower of
any assignment or participation thereof made pursuant to this Section 9.04. The
Lender may, in connection with any assignment or participation or any proposed
assignment or participation pursuant to this Section 9.04, disclose to the
assignee or participant or proposed assignee or participant any information
relating to the Borrower and the Pledged Assets furnished to the Lender by or on
behalf of the Borrower or the

                                       77

<PAGE>

Servicer; provided, however, that the Lender shall not disclose any such
information until it has obtained an agreement from such assignee or participant
or proposed assignee or participant that it shall treat as confidential (under
terms mutually satisfactory to the Agent and such assignee or participant or
proposed assignee or participant) any information obtained which is not already
publicly known or available.

          (b) Whenever the term "Lender" is used herein, it shall mean Autobahn
and/or any other Person which shall have executed an Assignment and Acceptance;
provided, however, that each such party shall have a pro rata share of the
rights and obligations of the Lender hereunder in such percentage amount (the
"Commitment Percentage") as shall be obtained by dividing such party's
commitment to fund Loans hereunder by the total commitment of all parties to
fund Loans hereunder. Unless otherwise specified herein, any right at any time
of the Lender to enforce any remedy, or instruct the Agent to take (or refrain
from taking) any action hereunder, shall be exercised by the Agent only upon
direction by such parties that hold a majority of the Commitment Percentages at
such time.

          (c) Subject to Section 9.04(a), each of the parties hereto hereby
agrees to execute any amendment to this Agreement that is required in order to
facilitate the addition of any new Lender hereunder as contemplated by this
Section 9.04.

          (d) Any bank or other financial institution (including, without
limitation, DZ BANK) providing liquidity support, credit enhancement or other
similar support under the Liquidity/Credit Enhancement Facility may assign, in
whole or in part, its rights and obligations thereunder without the consent of
the Borrower or the Servicer.

          SECTION 9.05 Term of This Agreement. This Agreement including, without
limitation, the Borrower's obligation to observe its covenants set forth in
Articles V and VI and the Servicer's obligation to observe its covenants set
forth in Articles V and VI, shall remain in full force and effect until the
Collection Date; provided, however, that the rights and remedies with respect to
any breach of any representation and warranty made or deemed made by the
Borrower or the Servicer pursuant to Articles III and IV and the indemnification
and payment provisions of Article VIII and Article IX and the provisions of
Section 9.08 and Section 9.09 shall be continuing and shall survive any
termination of this Agreement.

          SECTION 9.06 GOVERNING LAW; JURY WAIVER; JURISDICTION. (a) THIS
AGREEMENT SHALL, IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION 5-1401 OF THE GENERAL OBLIGATIONS
LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, BE GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK,
WITHOUT REGARD TO ANY CONFLICTS OF LAW PRINCIPLES THEREOF THAT WOULD CALL FOR
THE APPLICATION OF THE LAWS OF ANY OTHER JURISDICTION, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT
THE VALIDITY OR PERFECTION OF THE INTERESTS OF THE LENDER IN THE PLEDGED
RECEIVABLES, OR REMEDIES HEREUNDER, IN RESPECT THEREOF, ARE GOVERNED BY THE LAWS
OF A JURISDICTION OTHER THAN THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

                                       78

<PAGE>

     (b) EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY

(II) CONSENTS TO THE JURISDICTION OF EACH SUCH COURT IN ANY SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR
PROCEEDING, AND (III) WAIVES ANY OBJECTION WHICH THEY MAY HAVE TO THE LAYING OF
VENUE OF ANY SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING IN ANY OF SUCH COURTS AND ANY CLAIM
THAT ANY SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING HAS BEEN BROUGHT IN AN INCONVENIENT
FORUM.

          SECTION 9.07 Costs, Expenses and Taxes. (a) In addition to the rights
of indemnification granted to the Back-Up Servicer, the Custodian, the Agent's
Bank, the Agent, the Lender and its Affiliates under Section 8.01 hereof, the
Borrower agrees to pay on demand all reasonable (and reasonably documented)
costs and expenses of the Back-Up Servicer, the Custodian, the Agent's Bank, the
Lender and the Agent incurred in connection with the preparation, execution,

Agent's Bank, the Agent or the Lender in connection with the enforcement of this
Agreement and the other documents to be delivered hereunder or in connection

          (b) The Borrower shall pay on demand any and all stamp, sales, excise

the execution, delivery, filing and recording of this Agreement, the other
documents to be delivered hereunder or any agreement or other document providing
liquidity support, credit enhancement or other similar support to the Lender

                                       79

<PAGE>

          (c) The Custodian shall pay all expenses it incurs in connection with
its services related to this Agreement and any other agreements executed in
connection herewith and the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby;
provided, that the Custodian shall be entitled to reimbursement for such expense

          SECTION 9.08 No Proceedings. Each of the Borrower, the Agent, the
Servicer and the Lender hereby agrees that it will not institute against, or

                                       80

<PAGE>

connection herewith shall be had against any administrator of the Lender or the
Agent or any incorporator, affiliate, stockholder, officer, employee or director
of the Lender or the Agent or of any such administrator, as such, by the
enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding, by virtue
of any statute or otherwise; it being expressly agreed and understood that the
agreements of each party hereto contained in this Agreement and all of the other
agreements, instruments and documents entered into by the Lender or the Agent
pursuant hereto or in connection herewith are, in each case, solely the
corporate obligations of such party (and nothing in this Section 9.09 shall be
construed to diminish in any way such corporate obligations of such party), and
that no personal liability whatsoever shall attach to or be incurred by any
administrator of the Lender or the Agent or any incorporator, stockholder,
affiliate, officer, employee or director of the Lender or the Agent or of any
such administrator, as such, or any of them, under or by reason of any of the
obligations, covenants or agreements of the Lender or the Agent contained in
this Agreement or in any other such instruments, documents or agreements, or
which are implied therefrom, and that any and all personal liability of every
such administrator of the Lender or the Agent and each incorporator,
stockholder, affiliate, officer, employee or director of the Lender or the Agent

          SECTION 9.10 Execution in Counterparts; Severability; Integration.
This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts and by different
parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when so executed shall be
deemed to be an original and all of which when taken together shall constitute
one and the same agreement. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature
page to this Agreement by facsimile shall be effective as delivery of a manually
executed counterpart of this Agreement. In the event that any provision in or
obligation under this Agreement shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in
any jurisdiction, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining
provisions or obligations, or of such provision or obligation in any other
jurisdiction, shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby. This
Agreement contains the final and complete integration of all prior expressions
by the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and shall
constitute the entire agreement among the parties hereto with respect to the
subject matter hereof, superseding all prior oral or written understandings
other than the Fee Letter.

          SECTION 9.11 Tax Characterization. Notwithstanding any provision of
this Agreement, the parties hereto intend that the Loans advanced hereunder
shall constitute indebtedness of the Borrower for federal income tax purposes.

          SECTION 9.12 Exclusivity. The Borrower and FCC hereby agree that
unless they have obtained the written consent of the Lender (which may be
granted or refused in the Lender's sole discretion) to do otherwise, from the
date hereof through and including the Facility Maturity Date, they will not, and
will cause their Affiliates not to, assign, transfer, pledge, convey, sell or
otherwise dispose of any Receivable (or any similar right to payment from any
Person related to home improvement loans) originated or otherwise acquired by
the Borrower, FCC or any

                                       81

<PAGE>

Affiliate thereof, except pursuant to the terms and provisions of this Agreement
and the other Transaction Documents; provided, however, that the provisions of
this Section 9.12 shall not apply to (i) Receivables which may be released from
the Pledge hereunder pursuant to Section 2.18 and (ii) Receivables which are
being financed through a Whole Loan Sale or a Take Out Securitization. The
Borrower and FCC hereby agree that, from the date hereof through and including
the Facility Maturity Date, they will, and will cause their Affiliates to, make
reasonable commercial efforts to originate each of their Receivables (or any
similar right to payment from any Person, the advancing of loans secured by real
estate or the financing of home improvements under installment sale contracts)
in such a manner that it will qualify as an Eligible Receivable hereunder.

                           [Signature page to follow.]

any right under such Contract or any other agreement included in the Receivable
File will render such Contract or any other agreement included in the Receivable
