         THIS CUSTODIAN AGREEMENT, dated as of January 15, 2003, is made between
General Motors Acceptance Corporation, a Delaware corporation, as Custodian (the

         WHEREAS, simultaneously herewith General Motors Acceptance Corporation
(in its capacity as seller, "GMAC"), and the Seller are entering into a Pooling
and Servicing Agreement, dated as of the date hereof (as it may be amended,
supplemented or modified from time to time, the "Pooling and Servicing
Agreement,") pursuant to which GMAC shall sell, transfer and assign, as of the
Initial Closing Date, with respect to the Initial Receivables and, as of each
Additional Closing Date, with respect to the Additional Receivables, to the
Seller without recourse all of its right, title and interest in and to the
Receivables;

         WHEREAS, in connection with such sale, transfer and assignment, the
Pooling and Servicing Agreement provides that the Seller shall simultaneously
enter into a custodian agreement pursuant to which the Seller shall revocably
appoint the Custodian as custodian of the Receivables Files pertaining to the
Receivables;

         WHEREAS, the Pooling and Servicing Agreement contemplates that the
Seller may enter into the Further Transfer and Servicing Agreements with the
Issuer, pursuant to which the Seller shall sell, transfer and assign, as of the
Initial Closing Date, with respect to the Initial Receivables, and as of each
Additional Closing Date, with respect to the Additional Receivables, to the
Issuer without recourse all of the Seller's right, title and interest in and to
the Receivables and under the aforementioned custodian agreement;

         WHEREAS, in connection with any such sale, transfer and assignment, the
Seller desires for the Custodian to act as custodian of the Receivables for the
benefit of the Issuer; and

         WHEREAS, after the execution of the Indenture, the Custodian will act
on behalf of the Indenture Trustee in connection with its duties as custodian of
the Receivables.

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual agreements herein
contained and of other good and valuable consideration the receipt and adequacy
of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as follows:

               1. Certain Definitions. Capitalized terms used but not otherwise
defined herein shall have the respective meanings assigned them in Part I of
Appendix A to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement or in the text of the Pooling
and Servicing Agreement. All references herein to "the Agreement" or "this
Agreement" are to this Custodian Agreement as it may be amended, supplemented or
modified from time to time, the exhibits hereto and the capitalized terms used
herein which are defined in such Appendix A, and all references herein to
Sections and subsections are to Sections and subsections of this Agreement
unless otherwise specified. The rules of construction set forth in Part II of

               2. Appointment of Custodian; Acknowledgment of Receipt. Subject

<PAGE>

Seller may sell, transfer and assign all of its right, title and interest under
this Custodian Agreement to the Issuer pursuant to the Further Transfer and
Servicing Agreements. The Custodian hereby agrees, in connection with any such
sale, transfer and assignment, to act as Custodian for the benefit of the Issuer
with respect to those Receivables of which from time to time the Issuer is the
Owner (as defined in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement). The Custodian
acknowledges that the Issuer has pledged the Receivables to the Indenture
Trustee under the Indenture and agrees to hold the Receivables on behalf of the
Indenture Trustee for the benefit of the Secured Parties. In performing its
duties hereunder, the Custodian agrees to act with reasonable care, using that
degree of skill and attention that the Custodian exercises with respect to
receivable files relating to comparable automotive receivables that the
Custodian services and holds for itself or others. The Custodian hereby
acknowledges receipt of the Receivable File for each Receivable listed on the
Initial Schedule of Receivables.

               3. Maintenance at Office. The Custodian agrees to maintain each
Receivable File at one of its branch offices as identified in the List of Branch
Offices attached hereto as Exhibit A, or at such other office of the Custodian
as shall from time to time be identified to the owner of the related Receivable
upon 30 days' prior written notice.

               4. Duties of Custodian.

                    (a) Safekeeping. The Custodian shall hold each Receivable
File described herein on behalf of the Owner of the related Receivable for the
use and benefit of the Owner and, if applicable, Interested Parties and shall
maintain such accurate and complete accounts, records and computer systems
pertaining to each Receivable File described herein as shall enable the Seller
and the Issuer to comply with their respective obligations under the Pooling and
Servicing Agreement and the other Basic Documents. Each Receivable shall be
identified as such on the books and records of the Custodian to the extent the
Custodian reasonably determines to be necessary to comply with the terms and
conditions of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and, if applicable, the other
Basic Documents. The Custodian shall conduct, or cause to be conducted, periodic
physical inspections of the Receivable Files held by it under this Custodian
Agreement, and of the related accounts, records and computer systems, in such a
manner as shall enable the Issuer and the Custodian to verify the accuracy of
the Custodian's inventory and record keeping. The Custodian shall promptly
report to the Owner of a Receivable any failure on its part to hold the related
Receivable File as described herein and maintain its accounts, records and
computer systems as herein provided and promptly take appropriate action to
remedy any such failure.

                    (b) Access to Records. Subject only to the Custodian's
security requirements applicable to its own employees having access to similar
records held by the Custodian, the Custodian shall permit the Owner of a
Receivable or its duly authorized representatives, attorneys or auditors to
inspect the related Receivable File described herein and the related accounts,
records and computer systems maintained by the Custodian pursuant hereto at such
times as the Owner may reasonably request.

                    (c) Release of Documents. The Custodian shall release any
Receivable (and its related Receivable File) to the Seller, the Servicer or the
Issuer, as

                                       2

<PAGE>

appropriate, under the circumstances provided in the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement and the other Basic Documents.

                    (d) Administration; Reports. In general, the Custodian shall
attend to all non-discretionary details in connection with maintaining custody
of the Receivable Files as described herein. In addition, the Custodian shall
assist the Issuer and Servicer generally in the preparation of routine reports
to the Securityholders, if any, or to regulatory bodies, to the extent
necessitated by the Custodian's custody of the Receivable Files described
herein.

                    (e) Servicing. The Custodian is familiar with the duties of
the Servicer, the servicing procedures and the allocation and distribution
provisions (including those related to principal collections, losses and
recoveries on Receivables) set forth in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the
Trust Sale and Servicing Agreement, the Note Purchase Agreement and the
Indenture and hereby agrees to maintain the Receivables Files in a manner
consistent therewith. The Custodian further agrees to cooperate with the
Servicer in the Servicer's performance of its duties under the Pooling and
Servicing Agreement, the Note Purchase Agreement and the Trust Sale and
Servicing Agreement.

         5. Instructions; Authority to Act. The Custodian shall be deemed to
have received proper instructions from the Issuer with respect to the Receivable
Files described herein upon its receipt of written instructions signed by an
Authorized Officer. A certified copy of a by-law or of a resolution of the
appropriate governing body of the Issuer (or, as appropriate, a trustee on
behalf of the Issuer) may be received and accepted by the Custodian as
conclusive evidence of the authority of any such officer to act and may be
considered as in full force and effect until receipt of written notice to the
contrary. Such instructions may be general or specific in terms.

         6. Indemnification By the Custodian. The Custodian agrees to indemnify
the Seller, the Issuer and each trustee for any and all liabilities,
obligations, losses, damage, payments, costs or expenses of any kind whatsoever
that may be imposed on, incurred or asserted against the Seller, the Issuer or
any such trustee as the result of any act or omission in any way relating to the
maintenance and custody by the Custodian of the Receivable Files described
herein; provided, however, that the Custodian shall not be liable to the Seller,
the Issuer or any such trustee, respectively, for any portion of any such amount
resulting from the willful misfeasance, bad faith or negligence of the Seller,
the Issuer or any such trustee, respectively.

         7. Advice of Counsel. The Custodian, the Seller and, upon execution of
the Basic Documents, the Issuer further agree that the Custodian shall be
entitled to rely and act upon advice of counsel with respect to its performance
hereunder and shall be without liability for any action reasonably taken
pursuant to such advice, provided that such action is not in violation of
applicable federal or state law.

         8. Effective Period, Termination, and Amendment; Interpretive and
Additional Provisions. This Custodian Agreement shall become effective as of the
date hereof, shall continue in full force and effect until terminated as
hereinafter provided, and may be amended at any time by mutual agreement of the
parties hereto. This Custodian Agreement may

                                       3

be terminated by either party by written notice to the other party, such
termination to take effect no sooner than sixty (60) days after the date of such
notice. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if General Motors Acceptance Corporation
resigns as Servicer under the Basic Documents or if all of the rights and
obligations of the Servicer have been terminated under the Further Transfer and
Servicing Agreements, this Custodian Agreement may be terminated by the Issuer
or by any Persons to whom the Issuer has assigned its rights hereunder. As soon
as practicable after the termination of this Custodian Agreement, the Custodian
shall deliver the Receivable Files described herein to the Issuer or the
Issuer's agent at such place or places as the Issuer may reasonably designate.

         9.  Governing Law. THIS CUSTODIAN AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND
CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE INTERNAL LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WITHOUT
REGARD TO THE PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAWS THEREOF OR OF ANY OTHER
