</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>5.6     Payment.  Options shall be exercised by the

of the Company (or its designee), setting forth the number of Shares
with respect to which the Option is to be exercised, accompanied by
full payment for the Shares.

<p>Upon the exercise of any Option, the Exercise Price shall

least 6 months, if acquired pursuant to an exercise of stock options)
having an aggregate Fair Market Value at the time of exercise equal to
the total Exercise Price, or (b) by any other means which the
Committee, in its sole discretion, determines to both provide legal
consideration for the Shares, and to be consistent with the purposes of
the Plan.

<p>As soon as practicable after receipt of a written
notification of exercise and full payment for the Shares purchased, the
Company shall deliver to the Participant (or the Participant's
designated broker), Share certificates (which may be in book entry
form) representing such Shares.

<p>5.7     Restrictions on Share Transferability.  The Committee
may impose such restrictions on any Shares acquired pursuant to the
exercise of an Option as it may deem advisable, including, but not
limited to, restrictions related to applicable federal securities laws,

which Shares are then listed or traded, or any blue sky or state
securities laws.

<p align="center">SECTION 6 <br>
MISCELLANEOUS</p>

<p>6.1     No Effect on Employment.  Nothing in the Plan shall
interfere with or limit in any way the right of the Company to
terminate any Participant's employment or service at any time, with or
without cause.  For purposes of the Plan, transfer of employment of a
Participant between the Company and any one of its Affiliates (or
between Affiliates) shall not be deemed a Termination of Employment.
Employment or service with the Company and its Affiliates is on an at-
will basis only.

<p>6.2     Indemnification.  The Committee and each person who
is or shall have been a member of the Board, shall be indemnified and
held harmless by the Company against and from (a) any loss, cost,
liability, or expense that may be imposed upon or reasonably incurred
by him or her in connection with or resulting from any claim, action,
suit, or proceeding to which he or she may be a party or in which he or
she may be involved by reason of any action taken or failure to act
under the Plan or any Option Agreement, and (b) from any and all
amounts paid by him or her in settlement thereof, with the Company's
approval, or paid by him or her in satisfaction of any judgment in any
such claim, action, suit, or proceeding against him or her, provided he
or she shall give the Company an opportunity, at its own expense, to
handle and defend the same before he or she undertakes to handle and
defend it on his or her own behalf.  The foregoing right of
indemnification shall not be exclusive of any other rights of
indemnification to which such persons may be entitled under the
Company's Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws, by contract, as a
matter of law, or otherwise, or under any power that the Company may
have to indemnify them or hold them harmless.

<p>6.3     Successors.  All obligations of the Company under the
Plan, with respect to Options granted hereunder, shall be binding on
any successor to the Company, whether the existence of such successor
is the result of a direct or indirect purchase, merger, consolidation,
or otherwise, of all or substantially all of the business or assets of
the Company.

<p>6.4     Beneficiary Designations.  If permitted by the
Committee (in its sole discretion), a Participant under the Plan may
name a beneficiary or beneficiaries to whom any vested but unpaid
Option shall be paid in the event of the Participant's death.  Each
such designation shall revoke all prior designations by the Participant
and shall be effective only if given in a form and manner acceptable to
the Committee.  In the absence of any such designation, any vested
benefits remaining unpaid at the Participant's death shall be paid to
the Participant's estate and, subject to the terms of the Plan and of
the applicable Option Agreement, any unexercised vested Option may be
exercised by the administrator or executor of the Participant's estate.

<p>6.5     Nontransferability of Awards.  No Option granted
under the Plan may be sold, transferred, pledged, assigned, or
otherwise alienated or hypothecated, other than by will, by the laws of
descent and distribution, or to the limited extent provided in
Section 6.4.  All rights with respect to an Option granted to a
Participant shall be available during his or her lifetime only to the
Participant.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Participant may, in a
manner specified by the Committee, transfer a Nonqualified Stock Option
to a Participant's spouse, former spouse or dependent pursuant to a
court-approved domestic relations order which relates to the provision
of child support, alimony payments or marital property rights.

<p>6.6     No Rights as Stockholder.  No Participant (nor any
beneficiary) shall have any of the rights or privileges of a
stockholder of the Company with respect to any Shares issuable pursuant
to an Option, unless and until certificates representing such Shares
shall have been issued, recorded on the records of the Company or its
transfer agents or registrars, and delivered to the Participant (or
beneficiary).

<p align="center">SECTION 7 <br>
AMENDMENT, TERMINATION, AND DURATION</p>

<p>7.1     Amendment, Suspension, or Termination.  The Board, in
its sole discretion, may amend or terminate the Plan, or any part
thereof, at any time and for any reason.  The amendment, suspension, or
termination of the Plan shall not, without the consent of the
Participant, alter or impair any rights or obligations under any Option
theretofore granted to such Participant.  No Option may be granted
during any period of suspension or after termination of the Plan.

<p>7.2     Duration of the Plan.  The Plan shall commence on the
date specified herein, and subject to Section 7.1 (regarding the
Board's right to amend or terminate the Plan), shall remain in effect
thereafter.

<p align="center">SECTION 8 <br>
TAX WITHHOLDING</p>

<p>8.1     Withholding Requirements.  Prior to the delivery of
any Shares pursuant to an Option, the Company shall have the power and
the right to deduct or withhold, or require a Participant to remit to
the Company, an amount sufficient to satisfy federal, state, and local
taxes (including the Participant's FICA obligation) required to be
withheld with respect to such Option (or exercise thereof).

<p>8.2     Withholding Arrangements.  The Committee, in its sole
discretion and pursuant to such procedures as he or she may specify
from time to time, may permit or require a Participant to satisfy all
or part of the tax withholding obligations in connection with an Option
by delivering to the Company already-owned Shares having a Fair Market
Value equal to the amount required to be withheld.  The amount of the
withholding requirement shall be deemed to include any amount which the
Committee determines, not to exceed the amount determined by using the
maximum federal, state or local marginal income tax rates applicable to
the Participant with respect to the Option on the date that the amount
of tax to be withheld is to be determined.  The Fair Market Value of
the Shares to be withheld or delivered shall be determined as of the
date that the taxes are required to be withheld.

<p align="center">SECTION 9 <br>
LEGAL CONSTRUCTION</p>

<p>9.1     Gender and Number.  Except where otherwise indicated
by the context, any masculine term used herein also shall include the
feminine; the plural shall include the singular and the singular shall
include the plural.

<p>9.2     Severability.  In the event any provision of the Plan
shall be held illegal or invalid for any reason, the illegality or
invalidity shall not affect the remaining parts of the Plan, and the
Plan shall be construed and enforced as if the illegal or invalid
provision had not been included.

<p>9.3     Requirements of Law.  The granting of Options and the
issuance of Shares under the Plan shall be subject to all applicable
laws, rules, and regulations, and to such approvals by any governmental
agencies or national securities exchanges, as may be required.

shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of the
State of California (with the exception of its conflict of laws
provisions).

construction of the Plan.
