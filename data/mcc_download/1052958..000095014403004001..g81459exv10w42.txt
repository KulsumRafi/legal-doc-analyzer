         3.       The Employment Agreement is hereby amended by deleting the
last two sentences in Section 3.1(b)(i), pertaining to Employee's bonus for the
first quarter of 2003 and by substituting in lieu thereof the following
addition to Section 3.1(b)(i):

                           For fiscal year 2003, Employee will be entitled to
                  an annual bonus (the "2003 Bonus"), based upon Employer's
                  achievement during 2003 of net sales and EBITDA under
                  Employer's operating plan for 2003 that has been approved by
                  the Board of Directors of Employer (the "Operating Plan"), as
                  follows:

                           (A)      If Employer's actual net sales during 2003
                                    are greater than fifty percent (50%) of the
                                    net sales for 2003 as reflected in the
                                    Operating Plan, then Employee will be
                                    entitled to a 2003 Bonus under this
                                    subparagraph (A) calculated under the
                                    formula X times Y times the Bonus
                                    Percentage, where X is Employee's Salary
                                    for 2003 and Y is 50%. The Bonus Percentage
                                    is determined by dividing actual net sales
                                    by Operating Plan net sales for 2003; where
                                    the result of such division is greater than
                                    50%, but less than 76%, the Bonus
                                    Percentage is 50%, where the result of such
                                    division is 76% or more, but less than
                                    100%, the Bonus Percentage is 75%, and
                                    where the result of such division is 100%
                                    or greater, the Bonus Percentage is 100%.

                           (B)      If the Employer's actual EBITDA for 2003 is
                                    greater than fifty percent (50%) of the
                                    EBITDA for 2003 as reflected in the
                                    Operating Plan, then Employee will be
                                    entitled to a 2003 Bonus under this
                                    subparagraph (B) calculated under the
                                    formula X times Y times the Bonus
                                    Percentage, where X is Employee's Salary
                                    for 2003 and Y is 50%. The Bonus Percentage
                                    is determined by dividing actual EBITDA by
                                    Operating Plan EBITDA for 2003; where the
                                    result of such division is greater than
                                    50%, but less than 76%, the Bonus
                                    Percentage is 50%, where the result of such
                                    division is 76% or more, but less than
                                    100%, the Bonus Percentage is 75%, and
                                    where the result of such division is 100%
                                    or greater, the Bonus Percentage is 100%.

                           (C)      For purposes of the 2003 Bonus, in the
                                    event Employer sells a product line or
                                    division during 2003 or in the event that
                                    Employer is acquired by a third party
                                    during 2003, then the 2003 Bonus shall be
                                    calculated using actual net sales and
                                    EBITDA through the month end immediately
                                    prior to such sale or acquisition and using
                                    net sales and EBITDA under the Operating
                                    Plan the through such month end.

                           (D)      The 2003 Bonus, if earned, will be payable
                                    to Employee on the next pay period after
                                    the 2003 audited financial statements are
                                    finalized.

                           Employee shall also be entitled to receive a
                  prorated Bonus, calculated on the formula set forth in the
                  first paragraph of this Section 3.1(b)(i), for the period
                  commencing January 1, 2004 and terminating on March 31, 2004
                  based upon the achievement during such period of an earnings
                  per share increase of either twenty-five percent (25%) or
                  thirty-five percent (35%), as described above, when compared
                  with the same period during 2003. Such Bonus for 2004, if
                  any, shall be payable May 1, 2004.

         4.       The Employment Agreement is hereby amended by adding a new
Section 4A to the Employment Agreement, as follows:

                  SECTION 4A.  OPTIONS UNDER INCENTIVE STOCK PLAN.

                           The Executive Committee of the Board of Directors of
                  Employer will grant to Employee options to purchase one
                  million (1,000,000) shares of common stock of Employer under
                  and subject to Employee's 1998 Stock Incentive Plan, as
                  amended (the "Plan"). Under the Plan, to the extent the
                  options are ISOs under the Plan, the option price will be one
                  hundred ten percent (110%) of the Fair Market Value (as
                  defined in the Plan) of a share of Employer's common stock on
                  the date the option is granted. Under the Plan, to the extent
                  the options are non-ISOs under the Plan, the option price
                  will be the Fair Market Value (as defined in the Plan) of a
                  share of Employer's common stock on the date the option is
                  granted. The options for such 1,000,000 shares shall vest and
                  become fully exercisable under and subject to the Plan as
                  follows: On June 1, 2003, options for such number of shares
                  that when multiplied by


                                      -3-
<PAGE>
                  the option price equals $100,000.00; on April 1, 2004,
                  options for such number of shares that when multiplied by the
                  option price equals $100,000.00; on April 1, 2005, options
                  for such number of shares that when multiplied by the option
                  price equals $100,000.00; and options for the remainder of
                  such shares on April 1, 2005. Upon a Change in Control (as
                  defined in the Plan), all unvested options then held by
                  Employee shall vest in full immediately prior to the
                  occurrence of such Change in Control if Employee is an
                  employee of Employer on the date of such vesting. Upon
                  Employer's termination of Employee's employment pursuant to
                  Section 2(c) above, all unvested options then held by
                  Employee pursuant to the above grant shall vest in full on
                  the date of notice under Section 2(c) above.

         5.       Except as expressly amended above, all other provisions of
the Employment Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. This Amendment
inures to the benefit of, and is binding upon, Employer and its respective
successors and assigns and Employee, together with Employee's executor,
administrator, personal representatives, heirs, and legatees. This Amendment is
intended by the parties hereto to be the final expression of their agreement
with respect to the subject matter hereof and is the complete and exclusive
statement of the terms thereof, notwithstanding any representations,
statements, or agreements to the contrary heretofore made. Except for the
Employment Agreement, this Amendment supersedes and terminates all prior
agreements and understandings between Employer and Employee concerning the
subject matter of this Amendment. This Amendment may be modified only by a
written instrument signed by all of the parties hereto. This Amendment shall be
deemed to be made in, and in all respects shall be interpreted, construed, and
governed by and in accordance with, the laws of the State of Georgia without
reference to its conflicts of law principles. This Amendment may be executed in
two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but
all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

         IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Amendment as
of the date first above written.
