                                                                               2

               "Replacement Acquisition": as defined in Section 8.2(h).

               "Total Prepayment Amount": as defined in Section 4.2(e).

          SECTION 3. Amendment to Section 4.2. Section 4.2 of the Credit
Agreement is hereby amended by adding a new paragraph (e), as follows:

               (e)  If, after the Closing Date, any Indebtedness shall be
     incurred by the Borrower pursuant to Section 8.2(h) and the Borrower does
     not consummate either a Permitted Acquisition or a Replacement Acquisition
     within 180 days after the incurrence of such Indebtedness, then an amount
     equal to 100% of the Net Cash Proceeds thereof shall be applied on the date
     which is 180 days after the incurrence of such Indebtedness toward the
     prepayment of the Term Loans as set forth in Section 4.8(b).
     Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 4.2(d), 4.2(e) or 4.8,
     with respect to the amount of any mandatory prepayment described in the
     previous sentence (such amount, the "Total Prepayment Amount"), the
     Borrower will, in lieu of applying such amount to the prepayment of Term
     Loans, as provided above, on the date specified above for such prepayment,
     give the Administrative Agent telephonic notice (promptly confirmed in
     writing) requesting that the Administrative Agent prepare and provide to
     each Term Lender a notice (each, a "Prepayment Option Notice") as described
     below (it being understood that for purposes of Section 9(a), the Total
     Prepayment Amount shall be due and payable on the Mandatory Prepayment Date
     in lieu of the date specified in the first sentence of this Section
     4.2(e)). As promptly as practicable after receiving such notice from the
     Borrower, the Administrative Agent will send to each Term Lender a
     Prepayment Option Notice, which shall be in the form of Exhibit I, and
     shall include an offer by the Borrower to prepay on the date (each a
     "Mandatory Prepayment Date") that is 10 Business Days after the date of the
     Prepayment Option Notice, the relevant Term Loans of such Lender by an
     amount equal to such Lender's pro rata portion of the Total Prepayment
     Amount (based upon the respective outstanding principal amount of the Term
     Loans then held by the Term Lenders) indicated in such Lender's Prepayment
     Option Notice. On the Mandatory Prepayment Date, (i) the Borrower shall pay
     to the relevant Term Lenders the aggregate amount necessary to prepay that
     portion of the outstanding relevant Term Loans in respect of which such
     Lenders have accepted prepayment as described above and (ii) the Borrower
     shall be entitled to retain the remaining portion of the Total Prepayment
     Amount not accepted by the relevant Lenders.

          SECTION 4. Amendment to Section 8.2. Section 8.2(h) of the Credit
Agreement is hereby amended in its entirety to read as follows:

               Indebtedness incurred by the Borrower to finance any Acquisition
     permitted under Section 8.8(i)(a "Permitted Acquisition") in an aggregate
     principal amount not to exceed $75,000,000 at any time outstanding;
     provided, that such Indebtedness is

                                                                               3

     either (x) an Additional Acquisition Extension of Credit or (y) is
     subordinated to the same extent as the obligations of the Borrower in
     respect of the Senior Subordinated Notes; provided further, that (A) if
     such Indebtedness is to be incurred to finance a Permitted Acquisition
     prior to the consummation of such Permitted Acquisition, the Borrower must
     have entered into a definitive purchase agreement with respect to such
     Permitted Acquisition prior to incurring such Indebtedness and the Borrower
     shall either (x) consummate such Permitted Acquisition within 180 days from
     the incurrence of such Indebtedness or (y) either (I) in each case within
     180 days from the incurrence of such Indebtedness (i) terminate such
     definitive purchase agreement, (ii) enter into another definitive purchase
     agreement with respect to another Permitted Acquisition (a "Replacement
     Acquisition") and (iii) consummate such Replacement Acquisition or (II)
     apply the Net Cash Proceeds of such Indebtedness toward the prepayment of
     the Term Loans as set forth in Section 4.2(e), and (B) if such Indebtedness
     is to be incurred to finance a Permitted Acquisition after the date of the
     consummation of such Permitted Acquisition, such Indebtedness must be
     incurred within 180 days of the date such Permitted Acquisition was
     consummated;

          SECTION 5. Conditions to Effectiveness. Conditions to Effectiveness.
This Amendment shall become effective on the date (the "Amendment Effective
Date") on which the Administrative Agent shall have received this Amendment,
executed and delivered by a duly authorized officer of each of Holdings, the
Borrower and the Required Lenders.

          SECTION 6. Representations and Warranties. The Borrower represents and
warrants to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders that as of the Amendment
Effective Date, after giving effect to this Amendment, no Default or Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing and the representations and warranties
made by the Borrower in or pursuant to the Credit Agreement or any other Loan
Document are true and correct in all material respects on and as of the
Amendment Effective Date as if made on such date (except to the extent that any
such representations and warranties expressly relate to an earlier date, in
which case such representations and warranties were true and correct in all
material respects on and as of such earlier date).

          SECTION 7. Continuing Effect of the Credit Agreement. This Amendment
shall not constitute an amendment or waiver of or consent to any provision of
the Credit Agreement not expressly referred to herein and shall not be construed
as an amendment, waiver or consent to any action on the part of the Borrower
that would require an amendment, waiver or consent of the Administrative Agent
or the Lenders except as expressly stated herein. Except as expressly amended
hereby, the provisions of the Credit Agreement are and shall remain in full
force and effect in accordance with its terms.

          SECTION 8. Counterparts. This Amendment may be executed by one or more
of the parties to this Amendment on any number of separate counterparts
(including by facsimile), and all of said counterparts taken together shall be
deemed to constitute one and the same instrument.
