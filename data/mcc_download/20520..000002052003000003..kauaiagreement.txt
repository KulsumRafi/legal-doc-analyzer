if applicable, shall be determined in accordance with the following:

     (a) The amount of Mandated Capital Expenditures by which the Purchase Price
is increased  shall be estimated by Seller in good faith based upon the relevant
account  balances  at the end of the month for which  Seller's  books are closed
next preceding the Closing Date, with such  adjustments as may be appropriate to
reflect changes in such account  balances  occurring  between such month-end and
the Closing Date. Any such estimated  amount shall be set forth in a certificate
of  Seller  delivered  to Buyer at least  five (5)  business  days  prior to the
Closing  Date,  which  certificate  shall set forth an estimate of the  Purchase
Price (the "Estimated  Purchase  Price"),  including the estimated amount of any
increase in the  Purchase  Price  pursuant  to this  Section  3.2,  and shall be
accompanied by reasonably detailed supporting documentation.

     (b) Within one hundred  twenty  (120) days after the Closing  Date,  Seller
shall  notify  Buyer of the actual  amount as  recorded  on  Seller's  books and
records  for  the  Business  of any  Mandated  Capital  Expenditures  that  were
estimated in arriving at the  Estimated  Purchase  Price.  Buyer may dispute any
amount so determined by Seller,  by written notice to Seller within fifteen (15)
days after  receipt of Seller's  notice.  If Buyer does not so dispute any item,
the party owing the  difference  between the  Estimated  Purchase  Price and the
Purchase Price shall pay such difference to the other party within ten (10) days
after the expiration of such fifteen (15) day period, plus interest at 8.25% per
annum on such amount from the Closing  Date to (but not  including)  the date of
payment.  If Buyer disputes the actual amount of any item, the undisputed amount
plus  interest at 8.25% per annum on such  amount from the Closing  Date to (but
not including) the date of payment shall be paid promptly by the owing party. If
such  dispute  cannot be  resolved  within  sixty  (60) days after the giving of
Buyer's notice that there exists a disputed amount,  then an independent auditor
mutually  agreeable to Buyer and Seller shall,  upon written  notice from either
Buyer or Seller,  resolve such dispute  within sixty (60) days after  receipt of
such  notice.  The  fees  and  expenses  of such  independent  auditor  shall be
allocated  between  Buyer  and  Seller so that  Seller's  share of such fees and
expenses  shall be in the same  proportion  that the  aggregate  amount  of such
remaining  disputed  amounts  so  submitted  by Buyer to such  auditor  that are
successfully  disputed by Buyer (as finally determined by such auditor) bears to
the total  amount of such  remaining  disputed  amounts so submitted by Buyer to
such auditor. Any determination by such independent auditor shall be binding and
conclusive upon the parties without  further appeal  therefrom.  Within ten (10)
days after the independent  auditor shall have resolved such dispute,  the party
owing the determined amount shall pay such determined amount to the other party,
plus interest at 8.25% per annum on such determined amount from the Closing Date
to (but not including) the date of payment.

          (5) Not hire any new  employee  unless  such  employee  is a bona fide
     replacement  for  either a  presently-filled  position  or a vacancy  in an
     authorized position with the Business;

          (6)  Continue to make  capital  expenditures  necessary  to  maintain,
     operate or repair the Assets or to replace  Assets  damaged or destroyed by
     casualty loss, and to make Mandated Capital  Expenditures,  in each case in
     the  ordinary  course of  business  in  accordance  with  prudent  business
     judgment and consistent  with past practice and policy,  including  capital
     expenditures   required   to  (i)  provide   service  to  ensure   adequate
     transmission or distribution  facilities under power supply contracts,  and
     (ii) fulfill  requirements  under the Certificate of Public Convenience and
     Necessity.  Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  Seller will not be required to
     make any capital  expenditures  relating to any capital project that is not
     included in the  applicable  Capital  Budget unless such  expenditures  are
     required to comply with either a tariff for the  Business or a mandate by a
     Governmental Body (in either case,  "Mandated Capital  Expenditures").  For
     purposes  of  clarification,   Mandated  Capital  Expenditures  also  shall
     include, without duplication,  expenditures to purchase materials, supplies
     and other  capital  items that are dedicated to, but as of Closing have not
     been used in, mandated capital projects and other expenditures  relating to
     mandated  capital projects that are recorded as an asset of the Business as
     of  the  Closing  Date  to  the  extent  such   expenditures  are  normally
     recoverable through rates,  including all such expenditures recorded in the
     Preliminary  Survey and  Investigation  account of the Business.  If Seller
     becomes obligated to incur any Mandated Capital  Expenditures,  then Seller
     shall  provide  to Buyer a  written  description  of the  mandated  capital
     project to which the  expenditures  relate.  Seller  also shall  deliver to
     Buyer a copy of the 2002 Capital  Budget  promptly  after it is approved by
     the Board of  Directors  of Seller.  If at  Closing  Seller's  actual  2002
     capital expenditures for the Business through the day immediately preceding
     the Closing  Date are less than the capital  expenditures  proposed in such
     approved fiscal year 2002 Capital Budget,  then Seller nonetheless shall be
     deemed to have  complied  with this  Section  6.1(a)(6) if such actual 2002
     capital expenditures  reasonably  approximate an appropriate  proportion of
     such approved 2002 budgeted capital  expenditures in light of the number of
     months in 2002 that have  passed  prior to the  Closing  Date,  the project
     timelines  used by Seller to plan for and to complete the various  approved
     capital projects,  and other facts and circumstances  relating to when such
     approved capital  expenditures  should  reasonably be expected to have been
     incurred during the 2002 fiscal year;

                                       20

          (7) Comply in all material respects with all applicable material Legal
     Requirements and Orders, including without limitation those relating to the
     filing of  reports  and the  payment  of Taxes due to be paid  prior to the
     Closing, other than those contested in good faith;

          (8) Except in the ordinary  course of business or in  accordance  with
     the terms of any existing Contract,  Employee Plan or collective bargaining
     agreement,  not grant any material increase or change in total compensation
     or benefits (taken as a whole) to any of the Transferred Employees or enter
     into any employment, severance or similar Contract with any Person or amend
     any such existing  Contracts to increase any amounts payable  thereunder or
     benefits provided  thereunder,  provided that Seller agrees to consult with
     Buyer  prior to  granting  any  increase in the  aggregate  recurring  cash
     compensation of the non-union  Transferred Employees by an amount in excess
     of three percent (3%) in any year;

          (9) Not terminate any Material Contract except in the case of a breach
     of such Contract by the other party thereto; or

          (10) Not create,  incur, assume,  guarantee or otherwise become liable
     with  respect  to any  indebtedness  for money  borrowed  other than in the
     ordinary  course of business (it being  understood and agreed that customer
     advances,  customer  deposits  and  construction  advances  do  not  create
     indebtedness  for money  borrowed),  except in connection  with  additional
     borrowings  under the Existing Loan  Documents and any renewal,  extension,
     rearrangement or refunding of any  indebtedness  created under or evidenced
     by the Existing  Loan  Documents,  and except  pursuant to advances made by
     Seller to the Business.

     (b) Access to the Business, Assets and Records; Updating Information.

          (1) From and after the date hereof and until the Closing Date,  Seller
     shall permit Buyer and its  Representatives  to have, on reasonable  notice
     and at reasonable times, reasonable access to all books, papers and records
     to the extent  that they  reasonably  relate to the  ownership,  operation,
     obligations  and  liabilities  of the  Business  and the Assets;  provided,
     however,  that  such  access  shall  not  unreasonably  interfere  with the
     operation of the Business; and provided,  further, that Buyer hereby agrees
     to defend,  indemnify and hold harmless  Seller from and against all Losses
     arising  out of or  relating to Buyer's  access  provided  pursuant to this
     Section 6.1(b)(1).  Without limiting the application of the Confidentiality
     Agreement, all documents or information furnished by Seller hereunder shall
     be subject to the Confidentiality Agreement.

          (2)  Seller  will  notify  Buyer as  promptly  as  practicable  of any
     significant  change in the ordinary course of business for the Business and
     of any material Proceedings  (Threatened or pending) involving or affecting
     the Business or the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement, and shall
     use reasonable efforts to keep Buyer fully informed of such events.

     (c) Consents. Seller will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
all necessary  Consents from any Person required to consummate the  transactions
contemplated  hereby,  including  the Consent of any Person  required  under any
Legal Requirement or Contract applicable to the Business.

          (b) Access to Information.  After Closing,  Buyer will, and will cause
     its  Representatives to, afford to Seller,  including its  Representatives,

     to prepare for and participate in any  investigation  with respect thereto,
     to prepare for and  participate in any other  investigation  and defend any
     Proceedings  relating  to or  involving  Seller or the  Business  for which
     Seller  may  be  responsible,  to  discharge  its  obligations  under  this
     Agreement and the other  Related  Documents to which its is a party and for
     other reasonable  purposes and will afford Seller reasonable  assistance in
     connection  therewith.  Buyer will cause such records to be maintained  for
     not less than seven  years from the  Closing  Date and will not  dispose of
     such records  without first  offering in writing to deliver them to Seller;
     provided,  however, that in the event that Buyer transfers all or a portion
     of the Business to any third party  during such period,  Buyer may transfer
     to such  third  party all or a portion  of the  books,  records,  files and
     documents related thereof,  provided such third party transferee  expressly
     assumes in writing the obligations of Buyer under this Section  6.2(b).  In
     addition,  on and after the Closing Date, at Seller's request,  Buyer shall
     make available to Seller and its Affiliates, employees, representatives and
     agents, those employees of Buyer requested by Seller in connection with any
     Proceeding,  including  to  provide  testimony,  to be  deposed,  to act as
     witnesses and to assist counsel; provided, however, that (x) such access to
     such employees shall not unreasonably  interfere with the normal conduct of
     the  operations  of Buyer  and (y)  Seller  shall  reimburse  Buyer for the
     allocated  time  charges  of such  employees  and the  out-of-pocket  costs
     reasonably incurred by Buyer in making such employees available to Seller.

          (c) Citizens  Guarantees and Surety  Instruments.  Buyer shall use its
     reasonable efforts to assist Seller in obtaining full and complete releases
     on the guarantees,  letters of credit,  bonds and other surety  instruments
     listed in Schedule 6.2(c). For purposes of this Section 6.2(c),  reasonable
     efforts shall include: (i) Buyer's assumption of the Contracts on the terms
     set forth in this Agreement; and (ii) an obligation on the part of Buyer to
     provide a guaranty,  letter of credit,  bond or other surety  instrument at
     Closing to the extent required by any Contract  assumed by Buyer at Closing
     and, in general,  an equivalent surety instrument to be substituted for any
     surety  instrument  provided by Citizens to any  beneficiary  in connection
     with the Business.

          (d) Other Covenants of Buyer.  Buyer agrees to submit to regulation by
     the Hawaii  Public  Utilities  Commission  to the same extent as such state
     regulatory  commission  currently  regulates  Seller in connection with the
     Business,  it being agreed that this covenant  shall  terminate and have no
     further effect upon Closing. Buyer also agrees to make no filings with such
     state regulatory commission or take any other action in connection with any
     Proceeding or Legal Requirement  relating to any other businesses conducted
     by Seller  that also are  subject to  regulation  by such state  regulatory
     commission.

          Section 6.3  Governmental Filings.

     (a) HSR Act Filing.  Buyer and Seller shall comply promptly with the notice
and  reporting  requirements  of the HSR Act.  Buyer  and  Seller  shall  comply
substantially with any additional  requests for information,  including requests
for  production  of documents  and  production  of witnesses  for  interviews or
depositions,  made by the Antitrust  Division of the United States Department of
Justice,  the  United  States  Federal  Trade  Commission  or the  antitrust  or
competition   law  authorities  of  any  other   jurisdiction   (the  "Antitrust
Authorities"). Buyer shall exercise its best efforts, and Seller shall cooperate
fully with Buyer, to prevent the entry in any Proceeding brought by an Antitrust
Authority or any Governmental Body which would prohibit,  make unlawful or delay
the  consummation of the  transactions  contemplated  by this Agreement.  Seller
shall not oppose any efforts of Buyer,  including  Buyer's proffer of consent to
any Order, to complete lawfully the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and shall  cooperate in good faith with Buyer and the Antitrust  Authorities  to
the same effect.

     (b) Other Regulatory Filings.  Buyer and Seller will, as soon as reasonably
practicable   following  the  Effective   Date,   prepare  and  file  with  each

Utilities  Commission,  requests for such  Consents as may be necessary  for the
transfer of the Assets (including the transfer of Seller's franchise relating to
the Business) in accordance with the terms of this  Agreement.  Buyer and Seller
will  diligently  pursue such  Consents  and will  cooperate  with each other in
seeking such  Consents.  To this end, the parties  agree to make  available  the
personnel  and other  resources of their  respective  organizations  in order to
accomplish actions reasonably required by them to obtain all such Consents.

     Section 6.4  Citizens Marks. Buyer acknowledges and agrees with Seller that
Seller has the absolute and  exclusive  proprietary  right to all names,  marks,
trade names, trademarks and corporate symbols and logos incorporating "Citizens"
and "CZN"  (collectively and together with all other names,  marks, trade names,
trademarks  and  corporate  symbols  and  logos  owned by  Seller  or any of its
Affiliates,  the  "Citizens  Marks"),  all  rights  to  which  and the  goodwill
represented thereby and pertaining thereto are being retained by Seller.  Within
one hundred  eighty (180) days after the Closing  Date,  Buyer shall cease using
any Citizens  Mark and shall remove from the Assets any and all Citizens  Marks.
Thereafter, Buyer shall not use any Citizens Mark in connection with the sale of
any products or services or otherwise in the conduct of its  businesses.  In the
event that Buyer breaches this Section 6.4, Seller shall be entitled to specific
performance  of  this  Section  6.4 and to  injunctive  relief  against  further
violations,  as well as any  other  remedies  at law or in equity  available  to
Seller.

     Section 6.5  Acknowledgment  by Buyer.  In order to induce  Seller to enter
into and perform this Agreement and the Related  Documents,  Buyer  acknowledges
and agrees with Seller as follows:

     (a) To the knowledge of Buyer, Seller's representations and warranties made
in Article V are true and correct as of the  Effective  Date.  To the extent any
representation  or warranty of Seller made herein is, to the  knowledge of Buyer
acquired prior to the Effective Date, untrue or incorrect,  (i) Buyer shall have
no rights  under  this  Agreement  or any  Related  Documents  by reason of such
untruth or inaccuracy,  and (ii) any such  representation  or warranty by Seller
shall be deemed to be amended to the extent  necessary  to render it  consistent
with such knowledge of Buyer.

     (b) Other than any  additional  environmental  due diligence that Buyer may
conduct pursuant to Section 12.1 of this Agreement, Buyer has concluded whatever
inspections, studies, tests and investigations Buyer desired to conduct relating
to the Business and the Assets,  including  economic reviews and analyses,  soil
tests,   engineering  analyses,   environmental   analyses  (including  Phase  I
environmental  assessments of the Assets) and analyses of any applicable records
of any Governmental Body. Buyer is relying solely on its own investigation as to
the  Business  and the Assets and is assuming  the risk that  adverse  physical,
economic or other  conditions or  circumstances  (including soil and groundwater
conditions) may not have been revealed by such investigation.

     (c) NONE OF SELLER OR ANY OF ITS  AFFILIATES OR  REPRESENTATIVES  MAKES ANY
REPRESENTATION   OR  WARRANTY  AS  TO  THE  ACCURACY  OR   COMPLETENESS  OF  ANY
INFORMATION,  WRITTEN OR ORAL,  FURNISHED TO OR PREPARED AT THE REQUEST OF BUYER
OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES OR REPRESENTATIVES  WITH RESPECT TO THE BUSINESS OR THE
ASSETS.

     (d) THE  REPRESENTATIONS  AND  WARRANTIES  SET  FORTH IN  ARTICLE V OF THIS
AGREEMENT  CONSTITUTE THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE  REPRESENTATIONS  AND WARRANTIES OF
SELLER TO BUYER IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTIONS  CONTEMPLATED  HEREBY AND BY
THE  RELATED  DOCUMENTS  THERE ARE NO  REPRESENTATIONS,  WARRANTIES,  COVENANTS,
UNDERSTANDINGS OR AGREEMENTS,  ORAL OR WRITTEN,  IN RELATION THERETO BETWEEN THE
PARTIES  OTHER  THAN  THOSE  INCORPORATED  HEREIN  AND  THEREIN.  EXCEPT FOR THE
REPRESENTATIONS  AND  WARRANTIES  EXPRESSLY  SET  FORTH  IN  ARTICLE  V OF  THIS
AGREEMENT, BUYER DISCLAIMS RELIANCE ON ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EITHER
EXPRESS  OR  IMPLIED,   BY  OR  ON  BEHALF  OF  SELLER  OR  ITS   AFFILIATES  OR
REPRESENTATIVES.  WITHOUT  LIMITING  THE  GENERALITY  OF  THE  FOREGOING,  BUYER
ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN SECTIONS 5.7, 5.11 AND 5.14,
THERE ARE NO  REPRESENTATIONS  OR  WARRANTIES  OF  SELLER  WITH  RESPECT  TO THE
CONDITION OF THE ASSETS,  COMPLIANCE WITH  ENVIRONMENTAL  LAWS AND ENVIRONMENTAL
PERMITS OR THE  PRESENCE  OR  RELEASES OF  HAZARDOUS  MATERIAL IN THE  FIXTURES,
SOILS,  GROUNDWATER,  SURFACE WATER OR AIR ON, UNDER OR ABOUT OR EMANATING  FROM
ANY OF THE PROPERTIES OR ASSETS OF SELLER.

     Section 6.6  Transition Plan. If Buyer and Seller have not already done so,
then (i) within 30 days after the Effective Date,  Buyer shall deliver to Seller
a list of its proposed  representatives  to a joint transition team, which shall
include expertise from various functional  specialties associated or involved in
providing  billing,  payroll and other support services provided to the Business
by any automated or manual  process using  facilities or employees  that are not
included among the Assets or Transferred Employees, and (ii) Seller will add its
representatives  to such team within 15 days after receipt of Buyer's list. Such
team will be responsible for preparing as soon as reasonably  practicable  after
the Effective  Date and at least 60 days prior to the Closing  Date,  and timely
implementing,  a transition plan which will identify and describe  substantially
all of the various  transition  activities  that the parties will cause to occur
before and after the Closing and any other transfer of control  matters that any
party reasonably believes should be addressed in such transition plan, including
the  migration  or  conversion  of the data  relating  to the  Business  that is
included among the Assets to Buyers information systems (it being understood and
agreed  that such  activity  will be at Buyer's  sole cost and expense and to be
performed by consultants  reasonable  satisfactory  to Seller).  If requested by
either party, the terms and conditions governing such transition activities will
be more fully set forth in a Transition Agreement reasonably satisfactory to the
parties.  If the parties  have not already  done so, then Buyer and Seller shall
use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause their Representatives on such
transition  team to  cooperate  in good  faith  and  take all  reasonable  steps
necessary to develop a mutually acceptable  transition plan by no later than 120
days after the Effective Date.

     Section 6.7 IDRB Obligations.

     (a)  Buyer's   Obligations   Regarding   IDRB   Indebtedness.   Each  party
acknowledges that (x) Seller is and on and after the Closing Date shall continue
to be and shall remain the primary obligor with respect to all IDRB Indebtedness
and related Bonds  outstanding  immediately on and after the Closing Date to the
same  extent as though no sale of the Assets had been made and that Buyer  shall
have no payment  obligations with respect to such IDRB  Indebtedness and related
Bonds  and (y) the IDRB  Documents  require  Seller  not to take or permit to be
taken any action  which  would  have the  effect,  directly  or  indirectly,  of
subjecting the interest on any of the Bonds to federal or state income taxation.
Accordingly,  Buyer  covenants  and agrees at Closing to execute  and deliver to
Seller an agreement  substantially  in the form attached  hereto as Exhibit 6.7,
with  respect to the Bonds  that will be  outstanding  on and after the  Closing
Date.  Buyer  represents,  warrants,  covenants and agrees,  that so long as any
Bonds are  outstanding,  (a) as the  "successor  in interest" to Seller (as such
term is used in Section  142(f)(3)(B)  of the IRC),  Buyer will cause the Assets
that were acquired, constructed,  improved or equipped with the proceeds of such
Bonds to be used as  facilities  for the local  furnishing  of  electric  energy
within  the  meaning  of  Sections  142(a)(8)  and  142(f)  of the  IRC  or,  if
applicable,  Section  103(b)(4)(E)  of the  Internal  Revenue  Code of 1954,  as
amended (that is, the local furnishing of electric energy from such Assets shall
only include  furnishing solely within the area consisting of (i) a city and one
contiguous county, or (ii) two contiguous counties; provided that such use shall
be to  provide  service  within  the same  service  area as  served by Seller on
January 1, 1997 (or within a county or a city any potion of which is within such
area)),  (b)  Buyer  has not made and shall  not make an  election  pursuant  to
Section  142(f)(4)(B) of the IRC to terminate tax-exempt bond financing by Buyer
and (c) Buyer  shall not  otherwise  take or permit to be taken any action  with
respect to the Assets and its use and  operation  thereof  which  would have the
effect,  directly or indirectly,  of subjecting interest on any of such Bonds to
federal or state income  taxation.  Buyer  acknowledges and agrees that Seller's
bond counsel may rely on Buyer's  representations,  warranties  and covenants as
hereinabove provided for the purpose of rendering legal opinions, as required by
the IDRB  Documents as a precondition  to the sale by Seller of such Assets,  to
the effect that the sale of such Assets will not result in the  inclusion of the
interest  on the Bonds in the gross  income of the  recipient  for  purposes  of
federal income  taxation.  Nothing in this Agreement is intended to nor shall it
be  interpreted  as (i) an assignment to, and assumption by, Buyer of any of the
IDRB  Documents,  or (ii) as an  undertaking  or  agreement  by Buyer to assume,
guarantee or pay any of Seller's loan or other payment  obligations  pursuant to
the IDRB Documents.

     (b) Consents and Legal  Opinions.  The parties  shall use their  respective
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all Consents and legal opinions as may
be required  under the IDRB  Documents to enable Seller to retain until maturity
the IDRB  Indebtedness  and to sell the Assets to Buyer  without the result that
the interest on the Bonds will be included in the gross income of the  recipient
for purposes of federal income taxation.

hereunder  prior to the Closing  Date,  including  pursuant to Section  8.1, and
shall have taken such actions as Seller may have  requested  pursuant to Section
11.2 hereof.

     (i) IDRB  Indebtedness.  Seller shall have  obtained all Consents and legal
opinions  required  under the IDRB Documents to enable Seller to retain the IDRB
Indebtedness until maturity,  and to sell the Assets to Buyer without the result
that the  interest on any of the Bonds will be  included in the gross  income of
the recipient for purposes of federal  income  taxation and without any event of
taxability   (as  such  term  is  customarily   used  in  municipal   securities
transactions)  arising from the sale of the Assets  pursuant to this  Agreement,
and  Buyer  shall  have  duly  executed  and  delivered  all of the  instruments
contemplated by Section 6.7(a).

extent that any failure of such  representations  and  warranties to be true and

Adverse Effect.

     (b) Compliance with  Agreements.  The covenants,  agreements and conditions
required by this Agreement to be performed and complied with by

shall not contain any restrictions or conditions  (other than those in effect on
the Effective Date or requiring  that the  regulatory  treatment with respect to
the Business in  existence  as of the  Effective  Date  applicable  to Seller be

such Order shall have  become a Final  Order.  In  addition,  Seller  shall have
obtained all other Consents of  Governmental  Bodies and other Persons which are
required in order to consummate the transactions  contemplated hereby other than
those the failure of which to obtain would not have a Material Adverse Effect.

     (e) HSR Act. The  applicable  waiting period under the HSR Act with respect
to the  transactions  contemplated  hereby  shall  have  expired  or  have  been
terminated.

     (f)  Injunctions.  On the  Closing  Date,  there  shall be no Orders  which
operate  to  restrain,  enjoin or  otherwise  prevent  the  consummation  of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

     (g) Opinion of Counsel. On the Closing Date, Buyer shall have received from
L. Russell Mitten,  Vice President and General Counsel of Seller,  an opinion in
the form of Exhibit 7.2(g) hereto.

     (h)  Documents.  Seller  shall  have  delivered  all of  the  certificates,
instruments,  contracts  and other  documents  specified  to be  delivered by it
hereunder,  including  pursuant to Section 8.1, and shall have made arrangements
reasonably  satisfactory to Buyer to deliver to Buyer as promptly as practicable
after the  Closing  such  records  (including  customer  and  employee  records)
necessary to own and operate the Business.

     (i) No Material  Adverse  Change.  Since the  Effective  Date,  no Material
Adverse Effect shall have occurred that has continuing  effect as of the Closing
Date.

                                     CLOSING

     Section 8.1  Closing.  The closing of the  purchase  and sale of the Assets
(the "Closing") will take place at the offices of Fleischman and Walsh,  L.L.P.,
1400 Sixteenth  Street,  N.W., Suite 600,  Washington,  D.C. 20036, on the first
calendar  day  of the  month  immediately  following  the  month  in  which  the
conditions  specified in Sections 7.1(d) and 7.2(d) have been satisfied,  unless
another time, date and place is agreed to in writing by the parties. The date of
the  Closing  is  referred  to in this  Agreement  as the  "Closing  Date."  The
transactions  to be consummated on the Closing Date shall be deemed to have been
consummated  as of 12:01 a.m. on the Closing  Date. At the Closing the following
events shall occur, each event being deemed to have occurred simultaneously with
the other events.

     (a) Bill of Sale.  Seller and Buyer  shall  execute and deliver the Bill of
Sale and  Assignment  and  Assumption  Agreement  in the form of Exhibit  8.1(a)
hereto (the "Bill of Sale").

     (b) Payment of Purchase Price.  Buyer will pay to Seller an amount equal to
the Estimated  Purchase Price by wire  transferring such amount, in lawful money
of the United States of America in immediately  available funds, to such account
as Seller shall have  designed by notice to Buyer.  If the Closing Date is not a
business day on which financial institutions are open and operating,  then on or
before  the last  business  day on  which  financial  institutions  are open and
operating  before the Closing Date,  Buyer shall deliver the Estimated  Purchase
Price to Buyer's lead bank (the "Escrow  Agent") in immediately  available funds
in U.S.  dollars.  Upon  receipt,  the Escrow Agent shall  invest the  Estimated
Purchase Price in an interest-bearing account mutually agreed upon by Seller and
Buyer.  At Closing,  Buyer  shall sign and  deliver to Seller a statement  which
confirms  that the Closing has occurred and which  instructs the Escrow Agent to
transfer to Seller the funds  representing the Estimated Purchase Price, plus an
amount  representing the interest earned on and after the Closing Date until the
date the funds are  transferred,  to an account that Seller  shall  designate at
least two (2)  business  days  prior to the date the funds  are  required  to be
transferred  hereunder.  The Escrow Agent shall refund the balance to Buyer. The
fees and expenses of Escrow Agent shall be paid equally by Seller and Buyer.

     (c)  Other  Related  Documents.  To the  extent  consistent  with the other
provisions of this Agreement,  Seller (or the  appropriate  Affiliate of Seller)
and Buyer shall  execute and deliver  such other  Related  Documents  (including
special warranty deeds,  conveyances,  certificates of title,  bills of sale and
assignment and assumption  instruments) reasonably requested by a party that are
necessary in order to satisfy any applicable Legal Requirements  relating to the
transfer of the Assets to Buyer or the assumption of the Assumed  Liabilities by
Buyer or which  are  customarily  given in the  State of  Hawaii  to  accomplish
transfers of assets of the type  involved;  provided,  however,  that nothing in
this clause (c) shall  obligate  Seller or any Affiliate of Seller to execute or
deliver any  document  that  affects,  in a manner  adverse to Seller,  Seller's
liability to Buyer as expressed herein and in the Bill of Sale.

     (d) IDRB Indebtedness.  Buyer and Seller shall execute and deliver the IDRB
Obligations  Agreement   contemplated  by  Section  6.7(a)  to  the  extent  not
previously executed and delivered by Buyer and Seller.

                                   TERMINATION

     Section 9.1  Termination  Rights.  This  Agreement may be terminated in its
entirety at any time prior to the Closing:

     (a) By the mutual written agreement of Seller and Buyer;

     (b) By Buyer, on the one hand, or Seller,  on the other hand, in writing if
there shall be in effect a  nonappealable  Order  prohibiting  the  transactions
contemplated by this Agreement;

     (c) By  Buyer,  upon  the  breach  in any  material  respect  of any of the
representations  and warranties of Seller  contained herein or in the failure by
Seller to perform and comply in any material  respect with any of the agreements
and  obligations  required by this Agreement to be performed or complied with by
Seller, provided that such breach or failure is reasonably likely to result in a
Material  Adverse Effect and is not cured or otherwise  addressed by Seller in a
manner  reasonably  acceptable to Buyer within 30 days of Seller's  receipt of a
written  notice  from  Buyer  that such a breach or  failure  has  occurred  (or
significant  efforts have not been commenced to cure such  misrepresentation  or
breach if it is  susceptible  to cure but not capable of being cured within such
30 days);

     (d) By  Seller,  upon the  breach  in any  material  respect  of any of the
representations and warranties of Buyer contained herein or the failure by Buyer
to perform and comply in any  material  respect with any of the  agreements  and
obligations  required by this  Agreement  to be  performed  or complied  with by
Buyer,  provided that such breach or failure is not cured or otherwise addressed
by Buyer in a manner  reasonably  acceptable to Seller within 30 days of Buyer's
receipt  of a written  notice  from  Seller  that such a breach or  failure  has
occurred  (or  significant   efforts  have  not  been  commenced  to  cure  such
misrepresentation  or breach if it is  susceptible  to cure but not  capable  of
being cured within such 30 days);

     (e) By either  party in  writing if the  Closing  has not  occurred  within
twelve (12) months after the Effective Date; provided,  however,  that the right
to terminate this  Agreement  under this Section 9.1(e) will not be available to
any  party  that  is in  material  breach  of its  representations,  warranties,
covenants or agreements contained herein; provided, however, that if Closing has
not occurred  within such period of time,  then Seller shall have the unilateral
right to  extend  such  period  of time by a further  six (6)  months,  and upon
Seller's exercise of such right, such period of time shall be so extended;

     (f) By Seller or Buyer,  as  appropriate,  if any  Governmental  Body whose
Consent is  required to fulfill a  condition  precedent  to Closing set forth in
Section  7.1(d) (with  respect to Seller) or in Section  7.2(d) (with respect to
Buyer) has  affirmatively  indicated that such Consent will not be given or will
contain terms or  conditions  (or, if such Consent has been  obtained,  contains
terms or  conditions)  that, in the  reasonable  business  judgment of Seller or
Buyer, as appropriate, will result in a condition precedent to Closing set forth
in Section 7.1(d) (with respect to Seller) or in Section 7.2(d) (with respect to
Buyer) not being satisfied; or


                                       29

     (g) By Seller if Buyer  shall  have  failed  to pay the  Purchase  Price at
Closing or if Seller reasonably  concludes that Buyer does not have available to
it committed sources of funding with which to pay the Purchase Price.

     Section 9.2  Limitation on Right to Terminate; Effect of Termination.

     (a) A party  shall not be  allowed  to  exercise  any right of  termination
pursuant to Section 9.1 if the event giving rise to the termination  right shall
be due to the willful  failure of such party seeking to terminate this Agreement
to perform or observe in any material respect any of the covenants or agreements
hereof to be performed or observed by such party.

     (b) If this  Agreement is terminated  as permitted  under Section 9.1, such
termination shall be without liability of or to any party to this Agreement,  or
any shareholder or Representative of such party; provided, however, that if such
termination  shall  result  from the  willful  failure of any party to fulfill a
condition to the performance of any other party or to perform a covenant of this
Agreement or from a material and willful  breach by any party to this  Agreement
(it being understood that the failure to cure a breach shall not, by itself,  be
a willful  breach of this  Agreement),  then such party  shall  (subject  to the
limitation  set forth in the last  sentence  of this  Section  9.2(b))  be fully
liable for any and all damages  sustained  or incurred  by the other  party.  If
prior to Closing either party to this Agreement  resorts to legal proceedings to
enforce  this  Agreement,  the  prevailing  party in such  proceedings  shall be
entitled  to  recover  all costs  incurred  by such party  including  reasonable
attorney's  fees,  in  addition  to any other  relief to which such party may be
entitled;  provided,  however,  and notwithstanding  anything to the contrary in
this  Agreement,  in no event  shall  either  party be  entitled  to receive any
punitive, indirect or consequential damages.

                                EMPLOYEE MATTERS

     Section 10.1  Employment of Transferred Employees.

     (a) Schedule  10.1 lists the total number of salaried and hourly,  nonunion
and union, employees actively employed as of the Effective Date by Seller or its
Affiliates whose primary duties relate to the Business ("Active Employees").  As
of the Closing Date,  Buyer shall employ all Active Employees of Seller employed
in  the  Business  being  acquired  ("Transferred  Employees")  in the  same  or
substantially   equivalent  positions,   and  at  the  same  compensation  level
(including wages,  salary and bonuses) as were in effect with Seller immediately
prior to the Closing  Date.  For  purposes of the  preceding  sentence,  "Active
Employees"  shall include all full-time  and part-time  employees,  employees on
military leave, maternity leave, leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act of
1993, on short-term  disability,  on layoff with recall rights, and employees on
other  leaves  of  absences  where  there  is a legal  or  contractual  right to
reinstatement.

<PAGE>

     (b) Prior to the  Effective  Date,  Seller has delivered to Buyer a list of
the  persons who would have been  Transferred  Employees  had the  Closing  Date
occurred on September 30, 2001, showing the following  information for each such
person:  (i) the name of each such  person;  (ii) the name of his or her current
employer; (iii) his or her current base pay and 2000 bonus; (iv) his or her hire
date,  any  rehire  date (if  available)  and years of  service;  (v) his or her
then-current  position and job title; (vi) whether such employee is subject to a
collective  bargaining  agreement or represented by a labor organization and, if
so, the name of the union and local,  (vii) whether such employee is on military
leave,  maternity  leave,  leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993,
short-term  disability,  on layoff  with  recall  rights,  or on other  leave of
absence with a legal or contractual right to reinstatement.  Seller shall update
such list  reflecting  such  information  as of a date not more than thirty (30)
days prior to the Closing  Date and deliver  such updated list to Buyer at least
ten (10) days prior to the Closing Date.

     Section 10.2  Assumption of Collective Bargaining Agreement Obligations. On
and after the Closing Date, Buyer, shall assume all of the Seller's  obligations
under, and be bound by the provisions of, each collective  bargaining  agreement
to the extent of provisions  covering  Transferred  Employees.  Each  collective
bargaining  agreement  shall be  identified on a Schedule 10.2 to be prepared by
Seller and submitted to Buyer prior to the Closing Date.  Seller shall cooperate
with Buyer in Buyer's  efforts to contact  the unions  representing  Transferred
Employees.

     Section 10.3  Cessation of Participation  in Seller's  Plans;  Proration of
Bonuses. From and after the Closing Date,  Transferred Employees shall accrue no
additional  benefits  under  any  employee  benefit  plan,  policy,  program  or
arrangement  of Seller or its  Affiliates.  Seller and Buyer shall  pro-rate the
obligation  to pay any bonuses  declared by Seller on or after the Closing  Date
that would have been payable to the  Transferred  Employees had the  Transferred
Employees remained employed by Seller or its Affiliates  throughout the calendar
year in which the Closing Date occurs,  in accordance with the provisions of any
policy,  plan,  practice or  arrangement  of Seller under which such bonus would
have been paid.  Buyer shall be obligated to pay that portion of each such bonus
determined by multiplying the amount of such bonus by a fraction,  the numerator
of which is the number of days from and after the Closing  Date  through the end
of the calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs,  and the  denominator  of
which is 365.

     Section 10.4  Similarity of Benefit  Packages.  As of the Closing Date, and
except as otherwise  expressly  provided in this Article X, Buyer shall  include
each Transferred  Employee in a benefit package  providing  benefits that are in
the  aggregate  substantially  similar  to  those  provided  by  Seller  to such
Transferred Employees immediately prior to the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, to the extent that one or more collective bargaining agreements being
assumed by Buyer  contains  provisions  pertaining to employee  benefits,  Buyer
shall provide the Transferred Employees covered by such agreements with benefits
that  are  consistent  with  the  terms  of  such  agreements  or are  otherwise
acceptable to the  applicable  Union.  For purposes of the  preceding  sentence,
Buyer's  401(k) Plan (as defined in Section 10.6) shall not be deemed to fail to
provide benefits that are consistent with the terms of the applicable collective
bargaining   agreement   merely  by  reason  of  the  fact  that  (i)   matching
contributions  under  Buyer's  401(k) Plan are made in cash rather than employer
stock, (ii) Buyer's 401(k) Plan offers comparable, but not identical, investment
options to the  investment  options  (other than employer  stock) under Seller's
401(k)  Plan,  and (iii)  Buyer's  401(k) Plan  employs a different  third-party
administrator than Seller's 401(k) Plan. Except as otherwise  expressly provided
in this  Article X, Buyer shall treat all service and  compensation  credited to
each such  Transferred  Employee as if such  service and  compensation  had been
rendered to, and paid by, Buyer for all purposes  under Buyer's  benefit  plans,
arrangements, and policies.

     Section  10.5  Defined  Benefit  Pension  Plan.  Seller  shall  retain  all
liabilities and assets for pension  benefits accrued through the day immediately
preceding the Closing Date by Transferred  Employees under the Citizens' Pension
Plan (the "Seller's Pension Plan"). Buyer shall cause all Transferred  Employees
to be  included  in Buyer's  defined  benefit  plan to be  established  prior to
Closing ("Buyer's Pension Plan") providing  benefits no less valuable than those
provided in Seller's  Pension  Plan.  Buyer shall take all actions  necessary to
cause  Buyer's  Pension  Plan to  recognize  the  service  that all  Transferred
Employees  had under  Seller's  Pension  Plan for  purposes  of such  Employees'
eligibility to participate,  vesting, attainment of retirement dates, subsidized
benefits,  entitlement  to  optional  forms of  payment,  and  benefit  accrual;
provided,  however, that a Transferred  Employee's benefit under Buyer's Pension
Plan shall be offset by his or her accrued benefit under Seller's  Pension Plan,
such  offset  amount to be based on the benefit  that would have been  available
with respect to such  Transferred  Employee under the terms of Seller's  Pension
Plan had  such  Seller's  Pension  Plan  benefit  commenced  on the  Transferred
Employee's annuity starting date under Buyer's Pension Plan and been paid in the
same form as the benefit paid under Buyer's Pension Plan.

     Section 10.6 401(k) Plan. Seller shall vest Transferred  Employees in their
account balances under Citizens 401(k) Savings Plan ("Seller's  401(k) Plan") as
of the Closing Date. Buyer shall take all action necessary to ensure that, as of
the Closing Date, it includes all  Transferred  Employees in a qualified  401(k)
plan  ("Buyer's  401(k)  Plan")  providing for matching  contributions  at least
equivalent in value to those provided to the Transferred Employee under Seller's
401(k) Plan immediately  prior to the Closing Date. Buyer shall take all actions
necessary to cause  Buyer's  401(k) Plan (i) to  recognize  the service that the
Transferred  Employees had in Seller's  401(k) Plan for purposes of  determining
such Employees'  eligibility to participate,  vesting,  attainment of retirement
dates, contribution levels and, if applicable, eligibility for optional forms of
benefit payments,  and (ii) to accept  direct-rollover  transfers of Transferred
Employees' account balances in Seller's 401(k) Plan, including transfers of loan
balances and related promissory notes.

     Section 10.7  Welfare Benefits.

     (a) Buyer shall take all action  necessary and  appropriate to ensure that,
on and after the Closing Date, Buyer maintains medical, health, dental, flexible
spending account,  accident,  life, short-term disability,  long-term disability
and  other  employee  welfare  benefit  plans  for the  benefit  of  Transferred
Employees that, in the case of nonunion Transferred  Employees are substantially
similar to those  benefits  provided by Seller under its  corresponding  welfare
benefit plans as in effect  immediately  prior to the Closing Date (the "Buyer's
Nonunion Welfare  Plans"),  and in the case of union  Transferred  Employees are
consistent with the terms of the applicable  collective  bargaining agreement or
are otherwise acceptable to the applicable Union (the "Buyer's Bargained Welfare
Plans").  The Buyer's Nonunion Welfare Plans and the Buyer's  Bargained  Welfare
Plans are hereinafter referred to collectively as the "Buyer Welfare Plans." For
purposes of determining eligibility to participate, and entitlement to benefits,
in each Buyer Welfare Plan,  each  Transferred  Employee  shall be credited with
service,   determined  under  the  terms  of  the  corresponding  welfare  plans
maintained by Seller immediately prior to the Closing Date (hereinafter referred
to collectively as the "Seller Welfare Plans"). Any restrictions on coverage for
pre-existing  conditions,  actively at work requirements,  waiting periods,  and
requirements for evidence of insurability under the Buyer Welfare Plans shall be
waived in the Buyer Welfare Plans for  Transferred  Employees,  and  Transferred
Employees  shall receive  credit under the Buyer Welfare Plans for  co-payments,
payments under a deductible limit made by them, and for  out-of-pocket  maximums
applicable to them during the plan year of the Seller  Welfare Plan in which the
Closing Date occurs. As soon as practicable on or after the Closing Date, Seller
shall  deliver to Buyer a list of the  Transferred  Employees  who had  credited
service  under a Seller  Welfare  Plan,  together  with  each  such  Transferred
Employee's  service,  co-payment,  deductible and out-of-pocket  payment amounts
under such plan.


                                       32

     (b) Buyer shall provide or cause to be provided  retiree  medical,  dental,
and life benefits to each retiree of the Business identified in Schedule 10.7 as
updated as of the Closing Date (the "Retirees") and to each Transferred Employee
who is considered to be a  "grandfathered  employee"  (as  hereinafter  defined)
under the same terms and  conditions  as applied to such Retiree or  Transferred
Employee  immediately  prior to the  Closing  Date,  and  Seller  shall  have no
obligation or liability,  contingent or otherwise,  to provide retiree  medical,
dental or life benefits to any such Retiree or Transferred  Employee on or after
the Closing Date. For purposes of this Section 10.7, a "grandfathered  employee"
is a union or nonunion  Transferred  Employee  who met "Rule 55"  (meaning  such
employee's age plus years of service equaled or exceeded  fifty-five (55)) as of
November 30,  1998.  Schedule  10.7  identifies,  as of December 31, 2001,  each
Retiree and each Active Employee who is a "grandfathered employee." Seller shall
update and deliver to Buyer an updated Schedule 10.7  concurrently with Seller's
updating and delivery to Buyer of the updated list required by Section  10.1(b).
Buyer agrees not to terminate or materially modify those post-retirement benefit
provisions  covering  "grandfathered"  Transferred  Employees,  Retirees,  their
spouses and dependents that are in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date.

     (c)  Within  sixty  (60) days  after the  Closing  Date,  Seller  agrees to
transfer to an exempt trust  established by Buyer under Section 501(c)(9) of the
IRC ("Buyer's VEBA") the amount held under any trust established by Seller under
Section  501(c)(9) of the IRC ("Seller's VEBA") to fund  post-retirement  health
care  and  life  insurance  benefits  for the  Business.  Such  amount  shall be
determined  based upon the  records of Seller  and any third  Person  engaged by
Seller to administer Seller's VEBA. Buyer agrees that Buyer's VEBA will apply an
amount at least equal to the sum of the assets  transferred  from  Seller's VEBA
(and  earnings  thereon  calculated  at the rate of return  generated by Buyer's
VEBA) to provide  post-retirement health care and life insurance benefits on and
after the Closing  Date to the  Retirees  and, as  applicable,  the  Transferred
Employees who become  eligible for such benefits  after  Closing.  Upon Closing,
Buyer  shall  be   responsible   for  all   obligations  of  Seller  to  provide
post-retirement  health care and life  insurance  benefits  to such  Transferred
Employees  and  Retirees,  and Seller and Seller's  VEBA shall cease to have any
liability, contingent or otherwise, for such benefits.

     Section 10.8  Flexible Spending Accounts.  Within sixty (60) days after the
Closing  Date,  Seller  shall  transfer to Buyer's  flexible  benefits  plan any
balances standing to the credit of Transferred Employees under Seller's flexible
benefits plan as of the date  immediately  prior to the Closing Date. As soon as
practicable  after the Closing  Date,  Seller  shall  provide to Buyer a list of
those  Transferred  Employees that have  participated in the health or dependent
care reimbursement accounts of Seller,  together with their elections made prior
to the Closing Date with respect to such account, and balances standing to their
credit as of the date immediately prior to the Closing Date.

     Section 10.9  Employment Agreements.  Buyer shall assume all obligations of
each employment agreement to which Seller or its Affiliates is a party and which
covers any Transferred Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date.

     Section  10.10  Vacation.  Seller shall pay to  Transferred  Employees  any
"banked"  vacation  credited to them prior to the Closing Date. On and after the
Closing Date,  Buyer shall provide to each Transferred  Employee  vacation in an
amount equal to the Transferred  Employee's vacation entitlement for the year of
the  Closing  reduced  by the  number of  vacation  days  that such  Transferred
Employee has taken prior to the Closing.


                                       33

     Section 10.11 Severance. In the event that Buyer terminates the services of
any Transferred  Employee within  twenty-four  (24) months following the Closing
Date  without  cause,  Buyer  shall  provide  to any such  Transferred  Employee
severance or separation pay benefits that are at least equal to the severance or
separation pay benefits that would have been paid by Seller had Seller continued
to employ such Transferred  Employee through the period ending on the employee's
date of termination  from Buyer,  based on Seller's  severance or separation pay
program at the Closing Date; provided,  however, that if a collective bargaining
agreement that is applicable to a union Transferred Employee would provide for a
greater benefit to be paid by Buyer,  the terms and conditions of such agreement
shall instead be applicable.

     Section  10.12  Plant Closing  Notice.  Upon not less than 60 days' written
notice from Buyer of Buyer's then present intention to terminate any Transferred
Employees  after the Closing,  Seller shall give any notice required to be given
by Seller under Chapter 394B, Hawaii Revised Statutes,  as amended.  Buyer shall
have the right to review and approve  such notice  prior to Seller's  release of
the same.  Seller  shall not be  obligated  to provide any notice if in Seller's
reasonable opinion,  after consultation with counsel and with Buyer, such action
(including  the  content of such  notice)  reasonably  could  result in Seller's
violation of any Legal Requirement or Order.

                                   ARTICLE XI
                                   TAX MATTERS

     Section 11.1  Purchase Price Allocation.  Prior to the Closing Date,  Buyer
and Seller shall use their good faith efforts to agree upon the allocation  (the
"Allocation") of the Purchase Price, the Assumed  Liabilities and other relevant
items  (including,  for  example,  adjustments  to the  Purchase  Price)  to the
individual assets or classes of assets within the meaning of Section 1060 of the
IRC. If Buyer and Seller agree to such  Allocation  prior to Closing,  Buyer and
Seller  covenant  and agree  that (i) the values  assigned  to the assets by the
parties' mutual  agreement  shall be conclusive and final for all purposes,  and
(ii)  neither  Buyer nor Seller will take any position  before any  Governmental
Body or in any Proceeding that is in any way inconsistent  with such Allocation.
Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,   if  Buyer  and  Seller  cannot  agree  to  an
Allocation,  Buyer and Seller  covenant  and agree to file,  and to cause  their
respective Affiliates to file, all Tax Returns and schedules thereto (including,
for example,  amended  returns,  claims for refund,  and those returns and forms
required under Section 1060 of the IRC and any Treasury regulations  promulgated
thereunder) consistent with each of such party's good faith Allocations,  unless
otherwise required because of a change in any Legal Requirement.

     Section 11.2  Cooperation with Respect to Like-Kind Exchange.  Buyer agrees
that Seller may, at Seller's election prior to the Closing Date, direct that all
or a portion of the Purchase  Price be  delivered to a "qualified  intermediary"
(as defined in Treasury Regulation  ss.1.1031(k) - (g)(4)) as to enable Seller's
relinquishment  of the  Assets to  qualify as part of a  like-kind  exchange  of
property  covered by Section  1031 of the IRC. If Seller so elects,  Buyer shall
cooperate  with Seller (but without  being  required to incur any  out-of-pocket
costs in the course thereof) in connection with Seller's  efforts to effect such
like-kind exchange, which cooperation shall include, without limitation,  taking
such  actions  as Seller  requests  in order to enable  Seller to  qualify  such
transfer as part of a like-kind  exchange of property covered by Section 1031 of
the IRC  (including  any actions  required to facilitate the use of a "qualified
intermediary"),  and Buyer  agrees  that  Seller  may  assign all or part of its
rights and delegate  all or part of its  obligations  under this  Agreement to a
person or entity acting as a qualified  intermediary  to qualify the transfer of
the Assets as part of a like-kind  exchange of property  covered by Section 1031
of the IRC.  Buyer and Seller agree in good faith to use  reasonable  efforts to
coordinate  the  transactions  contemplated  by this  Agreement  with any  other
transactions  engaged in by either Buyer or Seller;  provided  that such efforts
are not required to include an  unreasonable  delay in the  consummation  of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

     Section 11.3  Transaction  Taxes.  Buyer shall bear and be responsible  for
paying any Hawaii sales, use, transfer, documentary,  registration, business and
occupation and other similar Taxes,  other than Hawaii General Excise Taxes,  if
any,  (including  related  penalties  (civil or criminal),  additions to tax and
interest)  imposed with respect to the  transfer of Assets  (including  the Real
Property)  to  Buyer  ("Transaction  Taxes"),  regardless  of  whether  the  tax
authority seeks to collect such Taxes from Seller or Buyer. Seller shall prepare
all tax filings  related to any  Transaction  Taxes  (other than with respect to
Real Property and motor vehicle title transfer and registration,  which shall be
prepared by Buyer).  Seller shall bear and be responsible  for any costs similar
to Transaction  Taxes imposed by any  Governmental  Body other than the State of
Hawaii or one of its political  subdivisions.  Fifteen (15) days prior to making
any such  filings,  the filing party shall  provide to the  nonfiling  party the
filing party's work papers for the nonfiling  party's  review and approval.  Ten
(10) days prior to the filing date,  the  non-filing  party shall provide to the
filing party approval of such work papers.  Buyer shall also be responsible  for
(i)  administering  the payment of such  Transaction  Taxes,  (ii)  defending or
pursuing any Proceedings related thereto,  and (iii) paying any expenses related
thereto.  Seller  shall  give  prompt  written  notice to Buyer of any  proposed
adjustment  or  assessment  of  any  Transaction   Taxes  with  respect  to  the
transaction, or of any examination of said transaction in a sales, use, transfer
or similar tax audit.  In any  proceedings,  whether formal or informal,  Seller
shall permit Buyer to participate and control the defense of such proceeding and
shall  take all  actions  and  execute  all  documents  required  to allow  such
participation.  Seller shall not  negotiate a settlement  or  compromise  of any
Transaction  Taxes  without the prior  written  consent of Buyer,  which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld.

     Section 11.4 Taxes Based on Revenues. All Taxes arising with respect to the
revenues of the Business shall be prorated between Buyer and Seller, with Seller
being  obligated to reimburse Buyer only for the portion of any such Tax that is
applicable to the cash received by Seller prior to the Closing Date that relates
to the  revenues of the Business  being taxed.  Upon receipt by Buyer of the tax
bill, invoice or other statement regarding such Taxes, Buyer shall calculate the
pro rata share of such tax bill,  invoice  or other  statement  attributable  to
Buyer and Seller. Buyer then shall forward, as soon as practicable,  to Seller a
copy  of  such  tax  bill,  invoice  or  statement  along  with  the  supporting
documentation  relating  to the  calculation  of the pro rata  share to  Seller.
Seller then shall forward to Buyer payment in immediately available funds of its
pro rata share of such Taxes as soon as  practicable  in advance of the due date
of the tax bill,  invoice or statement  and in time to avoid the  incurrence  of
penalties or interest. Upon its receipt of such payment, Buyer will pay the full
amount of the tax bill, invoice or statement to the applicable taxing authority.
In the event Seller first receives a tax bill,  invoice or statement relating to
the revenues of the Business from a taxing  authority,  Seller shall immediately
forward such tax bill, invoice or statement to Buyer.

                                   ARTICLE XII
                              ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

     Section 12.1  Environmental Due Diligence.

     (a) Right to Conduct Environmental Due Diligence.  Regarding  environmental
matters,  other than any additional  environmental  due diligence that Buyer may
conduct  pursuant to this Section 12.1,  Buyer has completed its  reasonable and
prudent  environmental  due diligence prior to the Effective  Date,  including a
review of the  Environmental  Data and Phase I environmental  assessments of the
Assets.  Buyer also has required Seller to make the  representations  concerning
environmental matters set forth in Section 5.14, upon which Buyer is relying. In
light of these actions, Buyer agrees not to conduct additional environmental due
diligence   (including   employee  interviews  and  sampling  of  any  media  or
wastewater) except in accordance with this Section 12.1. All activities of Buyer
regarding  environmental  due  diligence  shall be  conducted  to  minimize  any
inconvenience  or  interruption  of the normal use and enjoyment of the Business
and the Assets.

     (b) Delivery of Environmental  Reports.  Seller has made available to Buyer
before the Effective Date copies of all written environmental audits, reports or
studies in Seller's  possession  of which  Seller has  Knowledge  and which were
prepared after December 31, 1996  (including any updated  environmental  audits,
reports and studies  regarding the foregoing  which were prepared after the date
of execution of the Original  Agreement),  concerning  the existence or possible
existence  of  Hazardous  Materials  on, or under or adjacent to any of the Real
Property  or  relating  to  potential   Environmental  Liability  of  Seller  in
connection with the Business or the Assets. Buyer shall provide to Seller copies
of all reports,  assessments and other information composed or compiled by Buyer
or  Buyer's  environmental  consultant(s)  promptly  following  Buyer's  receipt
thereof.  Buyer shall treat all such  information  delivered  to, or composed or
compiled by, Buyer or Buyer's environmental  consultant(s) as Environmental Data
in accordance with the procedures of Section 12.1(c).

     (c) Confidentiality of Environmental Data. All audits,  reports and studies
delivered  to or  prepared  by Buyer and all  other  information  collected  and
generated as a result of Buyer's  environmental  due  diligence  ("Environmental
Data")  will be  subject  to the terms  and  conditions  of the  Confidentiality
Agreement,  except as otherwise expressly provided in this Section 12.1. Neither
Buyer  nor  its  environmental  consultant(s)  shall  disclose  or  release  any
Environmental  Data  without  the prior  written  consent of Seller and all such
information shall be kept strictly confidential. The Environmental Data shall be
prepared at the request of counsel to Buyer and, to the fullest extent permitted
by law,  shall be the work product of such counsel and  constitute  confidential
attorney/client  communications.  The  Environmental  Data shall be  transferred
among  Buyer  and its  consultant(s)  in a manner  that  will  preserve,  to the
greatest extent possible, such privileges. Buyer expressly agrees that until the
Closing,  it will not  distribute  the  Environmental  Data to any  third  party
without Seller's prior written consent.  After the Closing, Buyer agrees that it
will not distribute the  Environmental  Data to any third party without Seller's
prior  written  consent,  except as required by law or by express  provisions of
Buyer's  corporate  compliance  program if Seller is provided  written notice at
least ten (10) days prior to such distribution,  provided,  however,  that for a
period of two (2) years  after  the  Closing  Date,  Buyer  may  distribute  the
Environmental  Data to any  potential  purchaser  of the Assets only after first
notifying the Seller.


                                       36
<PAGE>

     (d)  Environmental  Consultants.  Buyer  may  retain  one or  more  outside
environmental   consultants  to  assist  in  its   environmental  due  diligence
concerning the Assets and shall notify Seller of the environmental consultant or
consultants Buyer intends to retain. Thereafter, Seller shall have five (5) days
after  receipt of such  notification  to notify  Buyer in  writing  of  Seller's
objection  (which  must be for good cause) and  substantiate  the basis for that
objection.  If Seller  does not  object  for good  cause and  substantiate  that
objection  within  said  five (5) day  period,  Seller  shall be  deemed to have
consented to Buyer's selection.

     (e)   Completed   Phase  I  Reviews.   Buyer  has  completed  its  Phase  I
environmental  assessment  activities  with  respect  to the  Assets,  including
reviewing existing  environmental reports,  correspondence,  permits and related
materials regarding the Assets,  individual site inspections and all other Phase
I activities as set forth in the ASTM protocol  regarding  Phase I environmental
assessments, and has delivered to Seller a true and complete copy of the related
Phase I assessment  report from Buyer's  environmental  consultant.  The parties
mutually acknowledge that all incidents and conditions addressed in such Phase I
assessment  report  comprise  either  incidents  and  conditions  that  had been
previously  disclosed  by Seller in  writing  to Buyer or,  with  respect to the
previously  undisclosed  incidents and conditions,  are incidents and conditions
that are not  reasonably  likely  to  result  in any  significant  Environmental
Liabilities.

     (f) Further  Phase I Reviews.  Buyer may not  conduct  any further  Phase I
environmental assessment activities with respect to the Assets without the prior
written consent of Seller, which consent may be withheld, conditioned or delayed
by Seller in its sole discretion.  Any further Phase I environmental  assessment
activities  permitted  by Seller  shall not  include any  sampling or  intrusive
testing and shall be conducted in accordance with ASTM standards regarding Phase
I assessments. As soon as reasonably practicable after completion of any further
Phase I assessment  activities,  Buyer's environmental  consultant shall prepare
and deliver to Buyer a written report with respect thereto.

     (g) Phase II  Reviews.  Buyer may not  conduct  any Phase II  environmental
assessment activities with respect to the Assets (including, but not limited to,
the taking and analysis of soil, surface water and groundwater samples,  testing
of buildings,  drilling wells,  taking soil borings and excavating)  without the
prior written consent of Seller,  which consent may be withheld,  conditioned or
delayed by Seller in its sole discretion.

     (h) Additional Due Diligence.  Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  if prior to
Closing  Seller  receives  notice of any  Proceeding  or  Threatened  Proceeding
arising under  Environmental Laws or if Seller otherwise acquires Knowledge that
is reasonably likely to require a change to Schedule 5.14, Seller promptly shall
notify  Buyer of the same and Buyer may request that Seller  authorize  Buyer to
conduct specific  additional  environmental due diligence measures if and to the
extent that such  measures are required to determine the extent of any potential
Environmental  Liability  relating  thereto.  Such  authorization  shall  not be
unreasonably  withheld,  conditioned or delayed by Seller.  Any such  additional
environmental  due diligence shall be conducted at Buyer's sole expense.  Within
ten (10) days  following the  completion  of any  additional  environmental  due
diligence  conducted  by Buyer  pursuant to this  Section  12.1(h),  Buyer shall
notify  Seller of each incident of potential  Environmental  Liability of Seller
that Buyer in good faith has determined is reasonably likely to result in Losses
in excess of $1,000,000 (each, a "New Material Environmental Liability").  Prior
to  Closing,  Seller may  respond to and remedy any New  Material  Environmental
Liability.  Any  New  Material  Environmental  Liability  not  responded  to and
remedied by Seller to Buyer's  reasonable  satisfaction  shall be  considered  a
Retained Environmental Liability for purposes of this Agreement.

                                       37

     (i)  Indemnity  for  Due  Diligence  Activities.  Buyer  hereby  agrees  to
indemnify and hold harmless  Seller,  Seller's  Affiliates and their  respective
officers, directors,  employees, agents, successors and assigns from and against
any and all Losses  with  respect to persons or  property  arising  out of or in
connection with any site visit by Buyer or its  environmental  consultant(s) and
resulting from an act or omission of Buyer or its environmental consultant(s).

                                  ARTICLE XIII
                                 INDEMNIFICATION

to the other  provisions of this Article XIII,  Seller shall  indemnify and hold
harmless  Buyer,  its  Representatives,  Affiliates,  successors  and  permitted
assigns  (collectively,  the "Buyer  Indemnitees")  from and against any and all
Losses arising out of or resulting from:

     (a) any representations and warranties made by Seller in this Agreement not
being true and correct when made or when  required by this  Agreement to be true
and  correct,  or any  breach or  default  by Seller in the  performance  of its
covenants,  agreements,  or  obligations  under this  Agreement  required  to be
performed prior to Closing;

     (b) any breach or default by Seller in the  performance  of its  covenants,
agreements,  or obligations under this Agreement  required to be performed after
Closing; and

     (c)  the  Retained  Liabilities,   including  the  Retained   Environmental
Liabilities.

     Section 13.2  Indemnification  by Buyer. From and after Closing and subject
to the other  provisions  of this Article XIII,  Buyer shall  indemnify and hold
harmless  Seller,  its  Representatives,  Affiliates,  successors  and permitted
assigns  (collectively,  the "Seller  Indemnitees") from and against any and all
Losses arising out of or resulting from:

     (a) any  representations and warranties made by Buyer in this Agreement not
being true and correct when made or when  required by this  Agreement to be true
and  correct,  or any  breach  or  default  by Buyer in the  performance  of its
covenants,  agreements,  or  obligations  under this  Agreement  required  to be
performed prior to Closing;

     (b) any  breach or default by Buyer in the  performance  of its  covenants,
agreements,  or obligations under this Agreement  required to be performed after
Closing, including the Buyer's IDRB Obligations;

     (c) Assumed Liabilities,  including the Assumed Environmental  Liabilities;
and

     (d) any  event as a result  of  which  the  interest  on the  Bonds  may be
included in the gross income of the  recipient  for  purposes of federal  income
taxation,  to the  extent  such event  arises  out of or  results  from any act,
negligence,  fault or failure of Buyer or any  assignee,  lessee or successor of
Buyer, including any violation of the representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements  set forth in  Section  6.7(a) or in the IDRB  Obligations  Agreement
executed and delivered by Buyer in accordance with Sections 6.7(a) and 8.1(d).

     Section 13.3 Limitations on Seller's Liability. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, the liability of Seller under this Agreement and
any documents  delivered in connection  herewith or contemplated hereby shall be
limited as follows:

     (a) IN NO EVENT  SHALL  SELLER BE LIABLE TO THE BUYER  INDEMNITEES  FOR ANY
EXEMPLARY,  PUNITIVE,  SPECIAL, INDIRECT,  CONSEQUENTIAL,  REMOTE OR SPECULATIVE
DAMAGES;  provided,  however,  that if Buyer is held liable to a third party for
any of such damages and Seller is  obligated  to indemnify  Buyer for the matter
that gave rise to such  damages,  then Seller shall be liable for, and obligated
to reimburse Buyer for, such damages.

     (b) The representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of Seller set
forth in this Agreement  shall survive the Closing for a period of one year, and
all representations,  warranties,  covenants and agreements of Seller under this
Agreement and the indemnities  granted by Seller in Section 13.1 shall terminate
at 5:00 p.m., local time in Stamford,  Connecticut,  on the first anniversary of
the Closing Date;  provided,  however,  that such indemnities shall survive with
respect  only to the  specific  matters  that is the  subject of a proper  Claim
Notice  delivered  in good faith in  compliance  with the  requirements  of this
Section  13.3  until  the  earlier  to  occur  of (A) the  date on which a final
nonappealable  resolution of the matter  described in such Claim Notice has been
reached or (B) the date on which the matter  described  in such Claim Notice has
otherwise reached final  resolution.  In no event shall any amounts be recovered
from Seller under  Section  13.1 or  otherwise  for any matter for which a Claim
Notice  is not  delivered  to  Seller  prior  to the  close of  business  on the
applicable date set forth above.

     (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in no event
shall Seller indemnify the Buyer Indemnitees,  or be otherwise liable in any way
whatsoever to the Buyer Indemnitees,  for any Losses until the Buyer Indemnitees
have  suffered  Losses  (determined  after giving  effect to the  provisions  of
Section  13.3(f))  that are in excess  of a  deductible  in an  amount  equal to
$5,400,000,  after which point  Seller will be obligated  only to indemnify  the
Buyer Indemnitees from and against further Losses in excess of such deductible.

     (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in no event
shall Seller indemnify the Buyer Indemnitees,  or be otherwise liable in any way
whatsoever  to the Buyer  Indemnitees,  for any Losses  that are in excess of an
amount equal to $5,400,000.

     (e) No amount shall be  recovered  from Seller for the breach or untruth of
any of Seller's representations, warranties, covenants or agreements, or for any
other matter, to the extent that Buyer had knowledge of such breach,  untruth or
other  matter prior to the  Closing,  nor shall Buyer be entitled to  rescission
with respect to any such matter.


                                       39
<PAGE>


     (f)  Seller  shall  have no  liability  for any  claim  or Loss (A) that is
covered by insurance  maintained by or for the benefit of Buyer or any Affiliate
of Buyer (including any such insurance  coverage  applicable to the Business the
benefit of which the Buyer will realize) or for which Buyer  otherwise  recovers
payments in respect of such Loss from any other  sources  (whether in a lump sum
or stream  of  payments)  or (B) that is the type  normally  recoverable  by the
Business  through rates.  No cost or expense  relating to any such claim or Loss
shall be  included  in  determining  the extent of Losses  suffered by the Buyer
Indemnitees for purposes of Section 13.3(c) or Section 13.3(d).  Buyer agrees to
use its  commercially  reasonable  efforts to give timely and effective  written
notice  to  the   appropriate   insurance   carrier(s)  of  any   occurrence  or
circumstances which, in the judgment of Buyer consistent with its customary risk
management  practices,  appear likely to give rise to a claim against Buyer that
is likely to involve one or more  insurance  policies of Buyer.  Any such notice
shall be given in good  faith by Buyer  without  regard  to the  possibility  of
indemnification payments by Seller under Section 13.1, and shall be processed by
Buyer  in good  faith  and in a  manner  consistent  with  its  risk  management
practices involving claims for which no third party contractual  indemnification
is  available.  Buyer agrees that (i) if it is entitled to receive  payment from
Seller for a Loss, and (ii) if Buyer has obtained  insurance which may cover the
claim or matter  giving rise to such Loss,  then (iii) such  insurance  shall be
primary coverage and Buyer will make a claim under such insurance (if such claim
can be made in good faith) before  enforcing  its right to receive  payment from
Seller.  If at any time  subsequent  to the receipt by a Buyer  Indemnitee of an
indemnity payment from Seller hereunder, such Buyer Indemnitee (or any Affiliate
thereof) receives any recovery, settlement or other similar payment with respect
to the Loss for which it receives such indemnity payment,  such Buyer Indemnitee
shall  promptly  pay to Seller an amount  equal to the amount of such  recovery,
less (for  insurance  proceeds  only) any  out-of-pocket  costs incurred by such
Buyer  Indemnitee (or its Affiliates) in connection  with claim  preparation and
settlement,  but in no event  shall any such  payment  exceed the amount of such
indemnity  payment;  provided,  that if such net  recover  reduces the amount of
Losses actually  incurred by the Buyer  Indemnitees  below the deductible amount
set forth in Section  13.3(c) and if Seller has made other payments to the Buyer
Indemnitees  for other Losses in excess of such  deductible  amount,  then Buyer
also  shall  promptly  pay to  Seller  an amount  equal to the  portion  of such
payments  made by Seller  that  Seller  would not have  been  obligated  to make
pursuant to Section 13.3(c) had the Losses of the Buyer Indemnitees not included
the Losses covered by such net recovery.  No other costs or expense  relating to
any such recovery shall reduce the amount of such payment to Seller.

     (g)   Notwithstanding  any  language  contained  in  any  Related  Document
(including deeds and other conveyance  documents relating to the Real Property),
the  representations  and  warranties of Seller set forth in this Agreement will
not be merged into any such Related Document and the indemnification obligations
of Seller, and the limitations on such obligations,  set forth in this Agreement
shall  control.  No provision  set forth in any such Related  Document  shall be
deemed to enlarge, alter or amend the terms or provisions of this Agreement.

     Section 13.4  Claims Procedure.


                                       40
<PAGE>

     (a) All claims for indemnification under Section 13.1 or 13.2, or any other
provision  of this  Agreement  except as  otherwise  expressly  provided in this
Agreement,  shall be asserted and resolved  pursuant to this Article  XIII.  Any
Person claiming indemnification hereunder referred to as the "Indemnified Party"
and any Person  against whom such claims are asserted  hereunder is  hereinafter
referred  to as the  "Indemnifying  Party."  In the event  that any  Losses  are
asserted against or sought to be collected from an Indemnified  Party by a third
party,  said Indemnified Party shall with reasonable  promptness  provide to the
Indemnifying Party a Claim Notice. The Indemnifying Party shall not be obligated
to  indemnify  the  Indemnified  Party with  respect  to any such  Losses if the
Indemnified  Party fails to notify the Indemnifying  Party thereof in accordance
with the provisions of this Agreement in reasonably  sufficient time so that the
Indemnifying Party's ability to defend against the Losses is not prejudiced. The
Indemnifying  Party shall have 30 days from the personal  delivery or receipt of
the Claim  Notice  (the  "Notice  Period") to notify the  Indemnified  Party (i)
whether  or not it  disputes  the  liability  of the  Indemnifying  Party to the
Indemnified  Party  hereunder with respect to such Losses and/or (ii) whether or
not it  desires,  at the sole cost and  expense of the  Indemnifying  Party,  to
defend the Indemnified Party against such Losses;  provided,  however,  that any
Indemnified  Party is hereby authorized prior to and during the Notice Period to
file any  motion,  answer or other  pleading  that it shall  deem  necessary  or
appropriate to protect its interests or those of the Indemnifying  Party (and of
which it shall have given notice and opportunity to comment to the  Indemnifying
Party) and not  prejudicial  to the  Indemnifying  Party.  In the event that the
Indemnifying  Party notifies the Indemnified Party within the Notice Period that
it desires to defend the Indemnified Party against such Losses, the Indemnifying
Party  shall  have the right to defend  all  appropriate  proceedings,  and with
counsel of its own  choosing,  which  proceedings  shall be promptly  settled or
prosecuted by them to a final  conclusion.  If the Indemnified  Party desires to
participate in, but not control,  any such defense or settlement it may do so at
its  sole  cost  and  expense.  If  requested  by the  Indemnifying  Party,  the
Indemnified  Party  agrees  to  cooperate  with the  Indemnifying  Party and its
counsel in contesting any Losses that the  Indemnifying  Party elects to contest
or,  if  appropriate  and  related  to the  claim in  question,  in  making  any
counterclaim  against  the  Person  asserting  the third  party  Losses,  or any
cross-complaint  against  any  Person.  No claim  may be  settled  or  otherwise
compromised without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party.

     (b) The  Indemnified  Party  shall  provide  reasonable  assistance  to the
Indemnifying Party and provide access to its books, records and personnel as the
Indemnifying  Party reasonably  requests in connection with the investigation or
defense of the Losses.  The  Indemnifying  Party shall  promptly upon receipt of
reasonable  supporting   documentation   reimburse  the  Indemnified  Party  for
out-of-pocket  costs  and  expenses  incurred  by the  latter in  providing  the
requested assistance.

     (c) With regard to third party claims for which Buyer or Seller is entitled
to  indemnification  under Section 13.1 or 13.2, such  indemnification  shall be
paid by the  Indemnifying  Party  upon:  (i) the entry of an Order  against  the
Indemnified  Party and the expiration of any applicable appeal period; or (ii) a
settlement  with the consent of the  Indemnifying  Party,  provided that no such
consent need be obtained if the Indemnifying Party fails to respond to the Claim
Notice as provided in Section 13.4(a). Notwithstanding the foregoing but subject
to  Section  13.4(a),   and  provided  that  there  is  no  dispute  as  to  the
applicability of  indemnification,  expenses of counsel to the Indemnified Party
shall be  reimbursed  on a current  basis by the  Indemnifying  Party as if such
expenses are a liability of the Indemnifying Party.

     Section 13.5  Exclusive Remedy. Except as otherwise provided in Section 6.4
or 14.6, the rights,  remedies and obligations of the Buyer  Indemnitees and the
Seller  Indemnitees set forth in this Article XIII will be the exclusive rights,
remedies and  obligations of such Persons after the Closing with respect to this
Agreement,  the  events  giving  rise to  this  Agreement  and the  transactions
provided  for  herein or  contemplated  hereby or  thereby.  No  Proceeding  for
termination or  rescission,  or claiming  repudiation,  of this Agreement or the
Bill of Sale may be brought or  maintained  by either party against the other on
and after the  Closing  Date no matter  how  severe,  grave or  fundamental  any
breach, default or nonperformance may be by one party. Accordingly,  the parties
hereby  expressly  waive and forego any and all rights they may possess to bring
any such Proceeding.

     Section 13.6  Indemnification for Negligence. WITHOUT LIMITING OR ENLARGING
THE SCOPE OF THE  INDEMNIFICATION  OBLIGATIONS SET FORTH IN THIS  AGREEMENT,  AN
INDEMNIFIED PARTY SHALL BE ENTITLED TO  INDEMNIFICATION  HEREUNDER IN ACCORDANCE
WITH THE TERMS  HEREOF,  REGARDLESS  OF WHETHER THE LOSS OR CLAIM GIVING RISE TO
SUCH  INDEMNIFICATION  OBLIGATION  IS THE  RESULT  OF THE  SOLE,  CONCURRENT  OR
COMPARATIVE  NEGLIGENCE,  STRICT LIABILITY,  VIOLATION OF ANY LAW OR OTHER LEGAL
FAULT OF OR BY SUCH  INDEMNIFIED  PARTY.  THE PARTIES AGREE THAT THIS  PARAGRAPH
CONSTITUTES A CONSPICUOUS LEGEND.

     Section 13.7  Waiver and Release. Buyer, on behalf of itself and each other
Buyer Indemnitee,  hereby forever waives, relieves,  releases and discharges the
Seller  Indemnitees  and their  successors  and assigns from any and all rights,
liabilities,  Proceedings (including future Proceedings) and Losses of any Buyer
Indemnitee,  whether  known or  unknown  on the  Closing  Date,  which any Buyer
Indemnitee has or incurs, or may in the future have or incur,  arising out of or
related to any Assumed Environmental Liability.

                               GENERAL PROVISIONS

     Section 14.3  Assignment.  This Agreement may not be assigned, by operation
of law or otherwise,  by any party hereto  without the prior written  consent of
the other party hereto, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld;  provided,
however,  in the event of any such  assignment  by a party by  operation  of law
without the consent of the other party as required  above,  such other party may
consent to such  assignment  after it has  occurred  and,  in such  event,  this
Agreement  and all the  provisions  hereof  shall be  binding  upon  the  Person
receiving such  assignment by operation of law.  Notwithstanding  the foregoing,
(a) Buyer may  assign  this  Agreement,  without  the prior  written  consent of
Seller, to any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Buyer provided such
subsidiary  assumes  in  writing  all of the  duties  and  obligations  of Buyer
hereunder (provided that no such assignment by Buyer shall in any way operate to
enlarge,  alter or change any  obligation  due to Seller or relieve Buyer of its
obligations hereunder if such subsidiary fails to perform such obligations, with
the  understanding  that Buyer shall be jointly and  severally  liable with such
subsidiary for any  nonperformance of Buyer's  obligations  hereunder);  and (b)
Seller  may  assign  all or part of its  rights or  delegate  all or part of its
duties under this  Agreement,  without the prior written  consent of Buyer, to a
qualified  intermediary  chosen  by  Seller  to  structure  all or  part  of the
transactions  contemplated hereby as a like-kind exchange of property covered by
Section 1031 of the IRC.

     Section 14.4  Successor  Bound.  Subject to the provisions of Section 14.3,
this  Agreement  shall be binding  upon and inure to the  benefit of the parties
hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

                                       43

     Section 14.5  Governing Law. The validity, performance,  and enforcement of
this  Agreement  and all Related  Documents,  unless  expressly  provided to the
contrary,  shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware without giving
effect to the principles of conflicts of law of such state.

     Section 14.6  Dispute Resolution.  Except as otherwise provided in Sections
3.2(b) and 6.4, and this Section 14.6, any dispute, controversy or claim between
the parties relating to, arising out of or in connection with this Agreement (or
any subsequent agreements or amendments thereto), including as to its existence,
enforceability,  validity,  interpretation,  performance  or  breach  or  as  to
indemnification or damages,  including claims in tort, whether arising before or
after the termination of this Agreement (any such dispute,  controversy or claim
being herein referred to as a "Dispute") shall be settled without litigation and
only by use of the following alternative dispute resolution procedure:

     (a) At  the  written  request  of a  party,  each  party  shall  appoint  a
knowledgeable, responsible representative to meet and negotiate in good faith to
resolve any Dispute.  The  discussions  shall be left to the  discretion  of the
representatives.   Upon  agreement,   the   representatives  may  utilize  other
alternative  dispute  resolution  procedures  such as mediation to assist in the
negotiations.  Discussions and correspondence among the parties' representatives
for purposes of these negotiations shall be treated as confidential  information
developed for the purposes of settlement,  exempt from discovery and production,
and without the  concurrence  of both  parties  shall not be  admissible  in the
arbitration  described  below,  or in any lawsuit.  Documents  identified  in or
provided  with such  communications,  which are not prepared for purposes of the
negotiations,  are not so exempted and may, if otherwise admissible, be admitted
in the arbitration.

     (b) If  negotiations  between  the  representatives  of the  parties do not
resolve the Dispute within 60 days of the initial written  request,  the Dispute
shall be submitted to binding arbitration by a single arbitrator pursuant to the
Commercial  Arbitration  Rules,  as then amended and in effect,  of the American
Arbitration Association (the "Rules").  Either party may demand such arbitration
in accordance with the procedures set out in the Rules.  The  arbitration  shall
take  place in San  Francisco,  California.  The  arbitration  hearing  shall be
commenced within 60 days of such party's demand for arbitration.  The arbitrator
shall have the power to and will instruct each party to produce evidence through
discovery (i) that is reasonably requested by the other party to the arbitration
in order to prepare and  substantiate  its case and (ii) the production of which
will not  materially  delay the  expeditious  resolution  of the  dispute  being
arbitrated;  each party hereto agrees to be bound by any such  discovery  order.
The  arbitrator  shall  control  the  scheduling  (so as to  process  the matter
expeditiously) and any discovery.  The parties may submit written briefs. At the
arbitration  hearing,  each party may make written and oral presentations to the
arbitrator,  present  testimony and written evidence and examine  witnesses.  No
party  shall be  eligible  to  receive,  and the  arbitrator  shall not have the
authority to award,  exemplary or punitive damages. The arbitrator shall rule on
the  Dispute  by  issuing a written  opinion  within 30 days  after the close of
hearings.  The arbitrator's  decision shall be binding and final.  Judgment upon
the  award  rendered  by the  arbitrator  may be  entered  in any  court  having
jurisdiction.


                                       44

     (c) Each  party  will bear its own costs and  expenses  in  submitting  and
presenting its position with respect to any Dispute to the arbitrator; provided,
however,  that if the  arbitrator  determines  that  the  position  taken in the
Dispute  by the  nonprevailing  party  taken  as a whole  is  unreasonable,  the
arbitrator may order the nonprevailing party to bear such fees and expenses, and
reimburse the prevailing  party for all or such portion of its reasonable  costs
and expenses in submitting and presenting its position,  as the arbitrator shall
reasonably  determine  to be fair  under the  circumstances.  Each  party to the
arbitration  shall pay one-half of the fees and expenses of the  arbitrator  and
the American Arbitration Association.

     (d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, (i) either party
may commence an action to compel  compliance  with this Section 14.6 and (ii) if
any party, as part of a Dispute,  seeks injunctive relief or any other equitable
remedy,  including specific  enforcement,  then such party shall be permitted to
seek such  injunctive  or  equitable  relief in any  federal  or state  court or
competent  jurisdiction  before,  during or after the pendency of a mediation or
arbitration proceed under this Section 14.6.

     Section  14.7  Cooperation.  Each of the parties  hereto  agrees to use its
reasonable  best  efforts to take or cause to be taken all action,  and to do or
cause to be done all things  necessary,  proper or  advisable  under  applicable
laws,  regulations  or  otherwise,  to  consummate  and to  make  effective  the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement,  including, without limitation, the
timely  performance of all actions and things  contemplated by this Agreement to
be taken or done by each of the parties hereto.

     Section 14.8  Construction  of Agreement.  The terms and provisions of this
Agreement  represent the results of negotiations  between Buyer and Seller, each
of which has been  represented  by counsel of its own  choosing,  and neither of
which  has  acted  under  duress  or  compulsion,  whether  legal,  economic  or
otherwise.  Accordingly,  the terms and  provisions of this  Agreement  shall be
interpreted and construed in accordance with their usual and customary meanings,
and  Buyer and  Seller  hereby  waive the  application  in  connection  with the
interpretation  and  construction  of this  Agreement  of any rule of law to the
effect that  ambiguous  or  conflicting  terms or  provisions  contained in this
Agreement  shall be  interpreted  or construed  against the party whose attorney
prepared  the  executed  draft or any  earlier  draft of this  Agreement.  It is
understood and agreed that neither the specification of any dollar amount in the
representations and warranties  contained in this Agreement nor the inclusion of
any  specific  item in the  Schedules or Exhibits is intended to imply that such
amounts or higher or lower amounts, or the items so included or other items, are
or are not  material,  and none of the parties shall use the fact of the setting
of such amounts or the fact of any  inclusion of any such item in the  Schedules
or Exhibits in any dispute or controversy  between the parties as to whether any
obligation, item or matter is or is not material for purposes hereof.

     Section 14.9  Publicity.  No party  hereto  shall issue,  make or cause the
publication  of any press  release or other  announcement  with  respect to this
Agreement  or the  transactions  contemplated  hereby,  or  otherwise  make  any
disclosures  relating  thereto,  without  the consent of the other  party,  such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided, however, that such
consent shall not be required where such release or  announcement is required by
applicable law or the rules or regulations  of a securities  exchange,  in which
event  the  party so  required  to issue  such  release  or  announcement  shall
endeavor,  wherever possible, to furnish an advance copy of the proposed release
to the other party.

     Section  14.10  Waiver.  Except as  otherwise  expressly  provided  in this
Agreement,  neither  the  failure  nor any  delay  on the  part of any  party to
exercise  any right,  power or  privilege  hereunder  shall  operate as a waiver
thereof,  nor shall any single or partial  exercise or waiver of any such right,
power or  privilege  preclude  any other or  further  exercise  thereof,  or the
exercise of any other right,  power or privilege  available to each party at law
or in equity.

     Section 14.11  Parties in Interest. This Agreement (including the documents
and  instruments  referred to herein) is not intended to confer upon any Person,
other than the parties hereto and their  successors and permitted  assigns,  any
rights  or  remedies  hereunder;  provided,  however,  that the  indemnification
provisions  in Article XIII shall inure to the benefit of the Buyer  Indemnitees
and the Seller Indemnitees as provided therein.

     Section 14.12  Section and  Paragraph  Headings.  The section and paragraph
headings in this Agreement are for reference  purposes only and shall not affect
in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

     Section  14.13  Amendment.  This  Agreement  may  be  amended  only  by  an
instrument in writing executed by the parties hereto.

     Section 14.14  Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the Exhibits and Schedules
hereto and the documents specifically referred to herein and the Confidentiality
Agreement  constitute the entire agreement,  understanding,  representations and
warranties  of the parties  hereto,  and supersede  all prior  agreements,  both
written and oral,  between Buyer and Seller,  including the Original  Agreement.
All  Exhibits  and  Schedules  annexed  hereto or  referred to herein are hereby
incorporated  in and  made a part  of this  Agreement  as if set  forth  in full
herein.  Disclosure  of any  fact  or  item  in  any  Schedule  referenced  by a
particular paragraph or Section in this Agreement shall, should the existence of
the fact or item or its contents be relevant to any other  paragraph or Section,
be deemed to be  disclosed  with  respect  to that  other  paragraph  or Section
whether or not any explicit cross-reference appears therein.

     Section  14.15  Counterparts.  This  Agreement  may be executed in multiple
counterparts,  each of  which  shall be  deemed  an  original,  and all of which
together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

     Section  14.16  Severability.  If any  term  or  other  provision  of  this
Agreement is invalid,  illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law
or public policy,  all other  conditions and provisions of this Agreement  shall
nevertheless  remain in full force and effect so long as the  economic  or legal
substance of the transactions  contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner
materially  adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto
shall  negotiate  in good  faith to modify  this  Agreement  so as to effect the
original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to
the end that  transactions  contemplated  hereby are  fulfilled  to the greatest
extent possible.
