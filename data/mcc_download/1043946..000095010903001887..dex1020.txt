contained herein and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, and in order to set forth the

                               A G R E E M E N T:

                                    ARTICLE 1

                                THE TRANSACTIONS

               1.1 Purchase and Sale of Securities from Seller. Subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, Buyer hereby agrees to purchase the
First Closing Securities from Seller, and Seller agrees to sell the First
Closing Securities to Buyer, at the First Closing.

               1.2 Purchase and Sale of Seller Shares. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, Buyer hereby agrees to purchase the Seller Shares

The Purchase Price shall be allocated $528,845.95 to the Note, $933,178.78 to
the Warrant, $148,472.58 to the First Closing CI Shares and $239,502.69 to the

               1.4 The Closings. The closing of the purchase and sale of the
First Closing Securities (the "First Closing") is taking place concurrently with
the execution and delivery of this Agreement. The closing of the purchase and
sale of the Seller Shares (the "Second Closing" and, collectively with the First
Closing, the "Closings") will take place as soon as practicable following the
satisfaction by Parent and Seller of their obligations set forth in Section 5.1
of this Agreement (but in no event more than 45 days following the date of this

               1.5 Alternative Events in Lieu of Second Closing. If Parent and
Seller fail to satisfy their obligations set forth in Section 5.1 of the

delivery of this Agreement, certificates representing all Remaining CI Shares,
accompanied by stock powers duly executed by Seller for each such certificate.
If and when Buyer delivers the Buyer Election to Seller, such certificates and
stock powers will automatically be deemed to be delivered to Buyer for purposes
of conveying the Remaining CI Shares to Buyer and title to the Remaining CI
Shares will immediately and automatically pass to Buyer.

                                    ARTICLE 2

               (a) The First Closing Securities and the Remaining CI Shares
constitute all securities of CI and its affiliates in which Parent, Seller or
any of their respective affiliates has any ownership or other interest. The CI
Shares and the Remaining CI Shares have been duly authorized and are validly
issued, fully paid and non-assessable. The Warrant has been duly authorized and
is enforceable against CFC in accordance with its terms. The shares of preferred
stock of CFC issuable upon exercise of the warrant have been duly authorized and
will be, upon such exercise, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable, and
the shares of common stock of CFC issuable upon conversion of such preferred
stock have been duly authorized and will be, upon such conversion, validly
issued, fully paid and non-assessable. The Note has been duly authorized and is
enforceable against CLLC in accordance with its terms. Seller is the true and
lawful owner, of record and beneficially, of the Note, the Warrant and the CI
Shares, free and clear of any liens, restrictions (other than restrictions
relating to transfer under the Securities Act or under the Amended and Restated
Investor Agreement dated as of May 25, 2001, as amended), security interests,
claims, rights of another or encumbrances (collectively, "Liens"). There are no
outstanding options or other similar rights, agreements or commitments to

the full power and authority to convey, and is conveying to Buyer, good and
marketable title to the Note, the Warrant, the First Closing CI Shares (and, if
applicable, the Remaining CI Shares), free and clear of all Liens.

               (b) The Seller Shares consist entirely of 1,000 shares of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Seller. The Seller Shares constitute all of
the issued and outstanding

                                        4

<PAGE>

capital stock of Seller. Parent is the true and lawful owner, of record and
beneficially, of the Seller Shares, free and clear of any Liens. There are no
outstanding options or other similar rights, agreements or commitments to
acquire from Parent any of the Seller Shares or to cause Seller to issue any
securities. Seller has the full power and authority to convey, and will convey
to Buyer, good and marketable title to the Seller Shares, free and clear of all
Liens.

                                    ARTICLE 5

                         ACTIONS PRIOR TO SECOND CLOSING

               5.1 Elimination of Other Assets and Liabilities. As promptly as
practicable following the First Closing (and in any event prior to the Second
Closing), Parent and Seller shall take all actions necessary to cause (i) all
assets of Seller other than the Remaining CI Shares (and other than
insignificant assets, including corporate minute books and other records,
relating to the existence of Seller as a corporation) to be disposed of in a
manner satisfactory to Buyer, and (ii) all liabilities or other obligations of
Seller (including but not limited to any liabilities relating to taxes of any
nature but excluding obligations arising under this Agreement) to be released
and extinguished in their entirety in a manner satisfactory to Buyer.

               5.2 Irrevocable Proxy. In support of Parent's and Seller's
obligations under this Agreement relating to the Second Closing, concurrently
with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Seller is executing and
delivering to Buyer an irrevocable proxy (such proxy being coupled with an
interest) with respect to the Remaining CI Shares. Such irrevocable proxy will
terminate upon the occurrence of the Second Closing. If for any reason such
irrevocable proxy is determined to be invalid or unenforceable, Seller agrees to
vote the Remaining CI Shares in the manner directed by Buyer with respect to any
matter that is put to a vote of the stockholders of CI.

               5.3 Indemnification. Parent will fully indemnify and hold
harmless Buyer and its directors, officers, agents, affiliates and
representatives from any costs, expenses, diminution in value or other damages
arising directly or indirectly from any failure to fully extinguish and have
released all liabilities of Seller as required by Section 5.1 of this Agreement.

               5.4 Actions by Parent and Seller. Parent and Seller will take
such actions as are necessary to cause their representations and warranties in
this Agreement to remain true at all times until the Second Closing. Without
limiting the foregoing, neither Parent nor Seller will take any action prior to
the Second Closing that would (i) have the effect of disposing of (or giving any
Person any right to acquire) any interest in any of the Seller Shares or the
Remaining CI Shares or of imposing any Lien on any of the Seller Shares or the
Remaining CI Shares or (ii) otherwise cause the Second Closing not to occur on
the terms provided in this Agreement.

                                    ARTICLE 6

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

entitled to enforce such term and against which such waiver is to be asserted.
No delay or omission on the part of any party in exercising any right or
privilege under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any
waiver on the part of any party of any right or privilege under this Agreement
operate as a waiver of any other right or privilege under this Agreement nor
shall any single or partial exercise of any right or privilege preclude any
other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or
privilege under this Agreement.

               6.3 Survival. The representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements set forth in this Agreement shall survive the Closings. Parent hereby
expressly waives, effective from and following the Second Closing, any right
that Parent may have against Seller (under any doctrine of contribution or
otherwise) with respect to Sellers breach of any representation or warranty in
this Agreement.
