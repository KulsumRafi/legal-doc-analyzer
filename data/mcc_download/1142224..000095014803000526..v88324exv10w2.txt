            (vi) No Proceedings. There are no proceedings or investigations
      pending, or to the Seller's best knowledge, threatened, before any court,
      regulatory body, administrative agency or other governmental
      instrumentality having jurisdiction over the Seller or its properties: (A)
      asserting the invalidity of this Agreement or any of the other Basic
      Documents, the Notes or the Certificates, (B) seeking to prevent the
      issuance of the Notes or the Certificates or the consummation of any of
      the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any of the other Basic
      Documents, (C) seeking any determination or ruling that might materially
      and adversely affect the performance by the Seller of its obligations
      under, or the validity or enforceability of, this Agreement, any of the
      other Basic Documents, the Notes or the Certificates or (D) which might
      adversely affect the federal or state income tax attributes of the Notes
      or the Certificates.

      (b) As to each Contract or all of the Contracts, as the case may be:

            (i) Schedule of Contracts. The information pertaining to such
      Contract set forth in the related Schedule of Contracts was true and
      correct in all material respects at the Closing Date and the calculations
      of the Principal Balances appearing in such Schedule of Contracts for each
      such Contract at the Closing Date and at each Distribution Date thereafter
      prior to the related Maturity Date have been performed in accordance with
      this Agreement and are accurate.

            (ii) Security Interests. As of the Closing Date, the Seller has
      taken all steps necessary to perfect its security interest against the
      Obligors in the Financed Vehicles securing the Contracts and such Contract
      granted a valid and enforceable first priority security interest in favor
      of WFS (or to the Bank, a Dealer or a Third Party Lender, which security
      interest has been assigned to WFS) in the related Financed Vehicle, and
      such security interest has been duly perfected and is prior to all other
      liens upon and security interests in such Financed Vehicle which now exist
      or may hereafter arise or be created (except, as to priority, for any lien
      for unpaid taxes or unpaid storage or repair charges which may arise after
      the Closing Date). The Seller has caused the filing of all appropriate
      financing statements in the proper filing office in the appropriate
      jurisdictions under applicable law in order to perfect the security
      interest in the Contracts granted to the Issuer hereunder. All financing
      statements filed against the Seller in favor of the Issuer in connection
      herewith describing the Contracts contain a statement to the following
      effect: "A purchase of or security interest in any collateral described in
      this financing statement will violate the rights of the Issuer unless the
      Issuer authorizes it."

            (iii) Title Documents. (A) If the related Financed Vehicle was
      originated in a State in which notation of a security interest on the
      Title Document is required or permitted to perfect such security interest,
      the Title Document for such Financed Vehicle shows, or if a new or
      replacement Title Document is being applied for with respect to such
      Financed Vehicle the Title Document will be received within 180 days of
      the Closing Date and will show WFS named as the original secured party
      under the related


                                       26
<PAGE>

      Contract as the holder of a first priority security interest in such
      Financed Vehicle, and (B) if the related Financed Vehicle was originated
      in a State in which the filing of a financing statement under the UCC is
      required to perfect a security interest in motor vehicles, such filings or
      recordings have been duly made and show WFS named as the original secured
      party under the related Contract, and in either case, the Indenture
      Trustee and the Owner Trustee have the same rights as such secured party
      has or would have (if such secured party were still the owner of the
      Contract) against all parties claiming an interest in such Financed
      Vehicle. With respect to each Contract for which the Title Document has
      not yet been returned from the Registrar of Titles, WFS has received
      written evidence from the related Dealer that such Title Document showing
      WFS as first lienholder has been applied for.

            (iv) Title to the Contracts. Immediately prior to the issuance of
      the Notes and the Certificates, the Seller had good and indefeasible title
      to and was the sole owner of each Contract to be transferred to the Issuer
      pursuant to Section 2.01 free of liens, claims, encumbrances and rights of
      any Person and, upon transfer of such Contract to the Issuer pursuant to
      Section 2.01, the Issuer will have good and indefeasible title to and will
      be the sole owner of such Contract free of liens, claims, encumbrances and
      rights of any Person, except for the Lien of the Indenture Trustee under
      the Indenture.

            (v) Current in Payment. As of the Closing Date, such Contract is no
      more than 30 days delinquent in payment as to all or any portion of any
      installment of Monthly P&I.

            (vi) Tax Liens. As of the Closing Date, there is no lien against the
      related Financed Vehicle for delinquent taxes.

            (vii) Rescission, Offset, Etc. As of the Closing Date, there is no
      right of rescission, offset, defense or counterclaim to the obligation of
      the Obligor to pay the unpaid principal or interest due under such
      Contract; the operation of the terms of such Contract or the exercise of
      any right thereunder will not render such Contract unenforceable in whole
      or in part or subject to any right of rescission, offset, defense or
      counterclaim, and no such right of rescission, offset, defense or
      counterclaim has been asserted.

            (viii) Mechanics' Liens. As of the Closing Date, there are no liens
      or claims for work, labor, material or storage affecting the related
      Financed Vehicle which are or may become a lien prior to or equal with the
      security interest granted by such Contract.

            (ix) Compliance with Laws. Such Contract, and the sale of the
      Financed Vehicle sold thereunder, complied, at the time it was made, in
      all material respects with all applicable state and federal laws (and
      regulations thereunder), including without limitation usury, equal credit
      opportunity, fair credit reporting, truth-in-lending or other similar
      laws, the Federal Trade Commission Act, and applicable state laws
      regulating retail installment sales contracts and loans in general and
      motor vehicle retail installment contracts and loans in particular; and
      the consummation of the transactions herein contemplated, including,
      without limitation, the transfer of ownership of the Contracts to


                                       27
<PAGE>

      the Issuer and the receipt of interest by the Securityholders, will not
      involve the violation of any applicable state or federal law.

            (x) Valid and Binding. Such Contract is the legal, valid and binding
      obligation of the Obligor thereunder and is enforceable in accordance with
      its terms, except as enforcement may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency
      or similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally;
      all parties to such Contract had full legal capacity to execute and
      deliver such Contract and all other documents related thereto and to grant
      the security interest purported to be granted thereby; and the terms of
      such Contract have not been waived or modified in any respect, except by
      instruments that are part of the Contract Documents.

            (xi) Enforceability. Such Contract contains customary and
      enforceable provisions such as to render the rights and remedies of the
      holder or assignee thereof adequate for the realization against the
      collateral of the benefits of the security, subject, as to enforceability,
      to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar laws affecting the
      enforcement of creditors' rights generally.

            (xii) No Default. As of the Closing Date, there was no default,
      breach, violation or event permitting acceleration existing under such
      Contract (except payment delinquencies permitted by clause (v) of this
      subsection) and no event which, with notice and the expiration of any
      grace or cure period, would constitute such a default, breach, violation
      or event permitting acceleration under such Contract, and the Seller has
      not waived any such default, breach, violation or event permitting
      acceleration except payment delinquencies permitted by clause (v) of this
      subsection.

            (xiii) Insurance. At the Closing Date, the related Financed Vehicle
      will be covered by (A) a comprehensive and collision insurance policy (1)
      in an amount at least equal to the lesser of (a) its actual cash value or
      (b) the principal amount due from the Obligor under the related Contract,
      (2) naming WFS as a loss payee and (3) insuring against loss and damage
      due to fire, theft, transportation, collision and other risks generally
      covered by comprehensive and collision coverage or (B) a LDI Policy;
      provided, however, that if such Financed Vehicle has an unpaid principal
      balance of less than $4,000.00 or the related Contract has six or fewer
      months remaining before its Maturity Date, it will not be required to be
      covered by the insurance described in this subparagraph. Each of the
      Seller, WFS and the Master Servicer shall at all times comply with all of
      the provisions of such insurance policies and the LDI Policy applicable to
      such Financed Vehicle.

            (xiv) Acquisition of Contract. Such Contract was either acquired by
      WFS (or its predecessor in interest) from a Dealer or a Third Party Lender
      with which it ordinarily does business or the Bank or originated directly
      by WFS in the ordinary course of its business, and no adverse selection
      procedures have been utilized in selecting such Contract from all other
      similar contracts purchased by the Seller.

            (xv) Scheduled Payments. As of the Closing Date, scheduled payments
      under such Contract are applied in accordance with the Rule of 78's method
      or the simple


                                       28
<PAGE>

      interest method and are due monthly in level payments through its Maturity
      Date sufficient to fully amortize the principal balance of such Contract
      by its Maturity Date, assuming timely payment by Obligors on Simple
      Interest Contracts, except that the payment in the first or last month in
      the life of the Contract may be minimally different from the level
      payment.

            (xvi) One Original. There is only one original of such Contract and
      such original, together with all other Contract Documents, is being held
      by the Master Servicer pursuant to Section 3.04. The Seller has received a
      written acknowledgement from the Master Servicer that the Master Servicer
      is holding the Contract Documents that constitute or evidence the
      Contracts solely on behalf and for the benefit of the Issuer. None of the
      Contract Documents that constitute or evidence each Contract has any marks
      or notations indicating that it has been pledged, assigned or otherwise
      conveyed to any Person other than the Issuer.

            (xvii) Characteristics. As of the Statistical Calculation Date such
      Contract had (A) a Principal Balance of not less than $1,001.84 nor more
      than $97,880.44, (B) an original term of not less than 12 months nor
      greater than 84 months, (C) a remaining maturity of not less than three
      months nor greater than 84 months and (D) an APR of not less than 5.00%.

      the Issuer.

            (xix) Maturity. As of the Closing Date such Contract did not have a
      Maturity Date later than the 90th day prior to the end of the Collection
      Period immediately preceding the Certificate Final Principal Distribution
      Date.

            (xx) Principal Balance. At the Closing Date the initial Principal
      Balance of such Contract was not greater than the purchase price of the
      related vehicle.

            (xxi) Location of Contract Files. The Contract Files are kept at one
      or more of the locations listed in Schedule B.

            (xxii) Finance Charge. With respect to each Contract, such Contract
      provides for the payment of a finance charge calculated at its APR based
      on the Rule of 78's or the simple interest method and such APR shall be
      equal to or greater than 5.00% for Rule of 78's Contracts and Simple
      Interest Contracts.

            (xxiii) WFS, Bank and Third Party Lender Originations. With respect
      to the Contracts, the aggregate Principal Balance as of the Statistical
      Calculation Date of such Contracts purchased by WFS from the Bank and
      Third Party Lenders or originated directly by WFS is not more than
      approximately 2.70% of the Statistical Calculation Date Principal Balance.

            (xxiv) Simple Interest Contracts. As of the Statistical Calculation
      Date, approximately 97.93% of the Contracts by Statistical Calculation
      Date Principal Balance


                                       29
<PAGE>

      shall be Simple Interest Contracts and approximately 2.07% of the
      Contracts by Statistical Calculation Date Principal Balance shall be Rule
      of 78's Contracts.

            (xxv) New or Pre-Owned Vehicles. At least 28.42% of the Contracts by
      Statistical Calculation Date Principal Balance were Contracts that
      financed new vehicles and not greater than 71.58% were Contracts that
      financed pre-owned vehicles.

            (xxvi) States of Origination. Approximately 37.42% of the Contracts
      by Statistical Calculation Date Principal Balance were originated or
      purchased by WFS in California and approximately 62.58% of the Contracts
      by Statistical Calculation Date Principal Balance were originated in
      states other than California.

            (xxvii) No Government Entity Obligors. Each Contract shall have an
      Obligor that is not a local, state or federal governmental entity.

            (xxviii) Chattel Paper. Each Contract constitutes "chattel paper"
      within the meaning of the applicable UCC.

            (xxix) Priority of Interest. This Agreement creates a valid and
      continuing security interest (as defined in the UCC) in the Contracts in
      favor of the Issuer, which security interest is prior to all other Liens,
      and is enforceable as such as against creditors of and purchasers from the
      Seller. Other than the security interest granted to the Issuer pursuant to
      this Agreement, the Seller has not pledged, assigned, sold, granted a
      security interest in, or otherwise conveyed any of the Contracts. The
      Seller has not authorized the filing of and is not aware of any financing
      statements against the Seller that include a description of collateral
      covering the Contracts other than any financing statement relating to the
      security interest granted to the Issuer hereunder, the security interest
      granted to the Indenture Trustee under the Indenture or that has been
      terminated.

            (xxx) Contract Characteristics as of the Closing Date. The
      representations and warranties made in this Section with respect to
      certain Contracts as of the Statistical Calculation Date shall also be
      true and correct in every material respect for all Contracts as of the
      Closing Date.

      Section 3.02. Purchase of Certain Contracts. The representations and
warranties of the Seller set forth in Section 3.01 shall survive delivery of the
Contract Documents to the Owner Trustee and shall continue until the termination
of this Agreement. Upon discovery by the Seller, the Master Servicer or the
Owner Trustee, as the case may be, that any of such representations and
warranties was incorrect as of the time made or that any of the Contract
Documents relating to any such Contract has not been properly executed by the
Obligor or contains a material defect or has not been received by the Owner
Trustee, such Person making such discovery shall give prompt notice to the other
such Persons. If any such defect, incorrectness or omission materially and
adversely affects the interest of the Noteholders, the Certificateholders, the
Indenture Trustee, the Owner Trustee or the Issuer the Seller shall, within 90
days after discovery thereof or receipt of notice thereof, cure the defect or
eliminate or otherwise cure the circumstances or condition in respect of which
such representation or warranty was incorrect as of the time made. If the Seller
is unable to do so, it shall purchase


                                       30
<PAGE>

such Contract on the Master Servicer Report Date next succeeding the end of such
90-day period from the Issuer for an amount equal to the related Repurchase
Amount in the manner set forth in Section 5.04. Upon any such purchase, the
Owner Trustee shall execute and deliver such instruments of transfer or
assignment, in each case without recourse, as shall be necessary to vest in the
Seller title to any Contract purchased hereunder. The sole remedy of the Issuer,
the Owner Trustee, the Indenture Trustee or the Securityholders with respect to
a breach of the Seller's representations and warranties pursuant to Section 3.01
shall be to enforce the Seller's obligation to repurchase Contracts pursuant to
this Section; provided, however, that the Seller shall indemnify the Owner
Trustee, the Indenture Trustee, the Issuer and the Securityholders against all
costs, expenses, losses, damages, claims and liabilities, including reasonable
fees and expenses of counsel, which may be asserted against or incurred by any
of them as a result of third-party claims arising out of the events or facts
giving rise to such breach.

      Section 3.03. Custody of Contract Files.

      (a) Subject to Sections 3.07, 7.04 and 8.01, the Owner Trustee hereby
irrevocably appoints the Master Servicer, and the Master Servicer hereby accepts
such appointment, to act as the agent of the Owner Trustee as custodian of the
Contract Documents and any and all other documents that the Master Servicer
shall keep on file, in accordance with its customary procedures, relating to a
Contract, Obligor or Financed Vehicle, which are hereby constructively delivered
to the Owner Trustee with respect to each Contract:

            (i) the original of the Contract;

            (ii) documents evidencing the existence of physical damage insurance
      covering the Financed Vehicles;

            (iii) the original credit application fully executed by the Obligor;
      and

            (iv) the original certificate of title or such documents that the
      Master Servicer shall keep on file, in accordance with its customary
      procedures, evidencing the security interest of the Master Servicer in the
      Financed Vehicle.

      (b) The Master Servicer shall maintain the Contract Documents held by it
(by itself or through one or more Subservicers) in a file area physically
separate from the other installment sales contracts and installment loans owned
or serviced by it or any of its Affiliates, which area shall be clearly marked
to indicate the Issuer as the owner of, and the security interest of the
Indenture Trustee in, the Contract Documents and shall mark the Contracts in the
same manner. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if failure to do so will not result
in the qualification, reduction or withdrawal by any Rating Agency of its
then-applicable rating on any Class of Notes, the Master Servicer shall not be
required to segregate or mark the Contracts and the file area may contain
contract documents for other motor vehicle retail installment sales contracts
and installment loans owned or serviced by the Master Servicer.

      The Master Servicer shall cause the electronic record of the Contracts
maintained by it to be clearly marked to indicate that the Contracts have been
sold to the Issuer and shall not in any way assert or claim an ownership
interest in the Contracts. It is intended by the Master Servicer's and the
Seller's agreement pursuant to this Section that the Owner Trustee shall be


                                       31
<PAGE>

deemed to have possession of the Contract Documents for purposes of Section
9-313 of the UCC of the state in which the Contract Documents are located.

      Section 3.04. Duties of Master Servicer as Custodian.

      (a) Safekeeping. The Master Servicer shall hold the Contract Files on
behalf of the Owner Trustee, the Indenture Trustee for the use and benefit of
all present and future Securityholders, and maintain such accurate and complete
accounts, records and computer systems pertaining to each Contract File as shall
enable the Issuer to comply with this Agreement. In performing its duties as
custodian the Master Servicer shall act with reasonable care, using that degree
of skill and attention that the Master Servicer exercises with respect to the
files relating to all comparable automobile contracts that the Master Servicer
owns or services for itself or others. The Master Servicer shall conduct, or
cause to be conducted, periodic physical inspections of the Contract Files held
by it under this Agreement and of the related accounts, records and computer
systems, and shall maintain them in such a manner as shall enable the Owner
Trustee and the Indenture Trustee to verify the accuracy of the Master
Servicer's record keeping. The Master Servicer shall promptly report to the
Owner Trustee and the Indenture Trustee any failure on its part to hold the
Contract Files and maintain its accounts, records and computer systems as herein
provided and shall promptly take appropriate action to remedy any such failure.

      (b) Maintenance of and Access to Records. The Master Servicer shall
maintain each Contract File at one of its offices specified in Schedule B or at
such other location as shall be specified to the Owner Trustee and the Indenture
Trustee by 30 days' prior written notice. The Master Servicer shall permit the
Owner Trustee and the Indenture Trustee or their respective duly authorized
representatives, attorneys or auditors to inspect the Contract Files and the
related accounts, records and computer systems maintained by the Master Servicer
at such times as such Persons may request. On or prior to the first Business Day
after the 14th day of each calendar month, the Master Servicer shall deliver a
data tape to the Backup Servicer containing information necessary for the Backup
Servicer to generate the statement required pursuant to Section 3.07(h) of the
Indenture and otherwise necessary for the servicing and administration of the
Contracts.

      (c) Release of Documents. Upon instruction from the Indenture Trustee (a
copy of which shall be furnished to the Owner Trustee), the Master Servicer
shall release any Contract File to the Indenture Trustee, the Indenture
Trustee's agent, or the Indenture Trustee's designee, as the case may be, at
such place or places as the Indenture Trustee may designate, as soon as
practicable.

      (d) Title Documents. The Master Servicer shall deliver to the Indenture
Trustee and the Owner Trustee (i) within 120 days of the Closing Date, a
schedule of Title Documents for Financed Vehicles which, as of the Closing Date
did not show the Master Servicer as first lienholder and (ii) within 180 days of
the Closing Date, a schedule of Title Documents for Financed Vehicles which as
of the date prior to such delivery do not show the Master Servicer as first
lienholder and as to which the Seller is obligated to repurchase pursuant to the
provisions hereof.

      Section 3.05. Instructions; Authority to Act. The Master Servicer shall be
deemed to have received proper instructions (a copy of which shall be furnished
to the Owner Trustee) with respect to the Contract Files upon its receipt of
written instructions signed by a Responsible Officer of the Indenture Trustee.

      Section 3.06. Indemnification. Subject to Section 8.02, the Master
Servicer shall indemnify the Issuer, the Owner Trustee, the Indenture Trustee,
the Backup Servicer and the Securityholders for any and all liabilities,
obligations, losses, compensatory damages, payments, costs or expenses of any
kind whatsoever (including the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) that may
be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the Issuer, the Owner Trustee,
the Indenture Trustee, the Backup Servicer, the Noteholders or the
Certificateholders as the result of any improper act or omission in any way
relating to the maintenance and custody by the Master Servicer of the Contract
Files, or the failure of the Master Servicer to perform its duties and service
the Contracts in compliance with the terms of this Agreement; provided, however,
that the Master Servicer shall not be liable to the Owner Trustee for any
portion of any such amount resulting from the willful misfeasance, bad faith or
negligence of the Owner Trustee and the Master Servicer shall not be liable to
the Indenture Trustee for any portion of any such amount resulting from the
willful misfeasance, bad faith or negligence of the Indenture Trustee. The
Master Servicer shall also indemnify and hold harmless the Issuer, the Trust
Estate and the Securityholders against any taxes that may be asserted at any
time against any of them with respect to the Contracts, including any sales,
gross receipts, general corporation, personal property, privilege or license
taxes (but exclusive of federal or other income taxes arising out of payments on
the Contracts) and the costs and expenses in defending against such taxes. The
Master Servicer shall immediately notify the Owner Trustee, the Indenture
Trustee and the Backup Servicer if a claim is made by a third party with respect
to the Contracts, shall assume, with the consent of the Owner Trustee, the
Indenture Trustee and the Backup Servicer, the defense of any such claim, pay
all expenses in connection therewith, including counsel fees, and shall promptly
pay, discharge and satisfy any judgment or decree which may be entered against
it or the Issuer.

      Section 3.07. Effective Period and Termination. The Master Servicer's
appointment as custodian shall become effective as of the Cut-Off Date and shall
continue in full force and effect until terminated under this Section, upon the
termination of the Issuer or the repurchase of all of the Contracts by the
Seller, whichever is first to occur. If the Master Servicer shall resign in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement or if all of the rights and
obligations of the Master Servicer shall have been terminated pursuant to
Section 8.01, the appointment of the Master Servicer as custodian shall be
terminated by the Indenture Trustee, by the Holders of Notes evidencing not less
than a majority of the Outstanding Amount of the Notes, by the Owner Trustee or
by Certificateholders evidencing not less than a majority of the aggregate
Certificate Percentage Interest, in the same manner as the Indenture Trustee,
the Owner Trustee or such Holders may terminate the rights and obligations of
the Master Servicer pursuant to Section 8.01. As soon as practicable after any
termination of such appointment, the Master Servicer shall, at its own expense,
deliver the Contract Files to the Owner Trustee or its agent or as designated by
the Owner Trustee at such place or places as the Owner Trustee may reasonably
designate and shall cooperate in good faith to effect such delivery.

      Section 3.08. Nonpetition Covenant.

      (a) Neither the Seller nor the Master Servicer shall petition or otherwise
invoke the process of any court or government authority for the purpose of
commencing or sustaining a case against the Issuer under any federal or state
bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law or appointing a receiver, liquidator,
assignee, trustee, custodian, sequestrator or other similar official of the
Issuer or any substantial part of its property, or ordering the winding up or
liquidation of the affairs of the Issuer.

      (b) The Master Servicer shall not, nor cause the Seller to, petition or
otherwise invoke the process of any court or government authority for the
purpose of commencing or sustaining a case against the Seller under any federal
or state bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law or appointing a receiver,
liquidator, assignee, trustee, custodian, sequestrator or other similar official
of the Seller or any substantial part of its property, or ordering the winding
up or liquidation of the affairs of the Seller.

      Section 3.09. Collecting Title Documents Not Delivered at the Closing
Date. In the case of any Contract in respect of which written evidence from the
Dealer selling or transferring the related Financed Vehicle that the Title
Document for such Financed Vehicle showing the Master Servicer as first
lienholder has been applied for from the Registrar of Titles was delivered to
the Owner Trustee on the Closing Date in lieu of a Title Document, the Master
Servicer shall use its best efforts to collect such Title Document from the
Registrar of Titles as promptly as possible. If such Title Document showing the
Master Servicer as first lienholder is not received by the Master Servicer or
the related Subservicer within 180 days after the Closing Date, then the
representation and warranty in Section 3.01(b)(iii) in respect of such Contract
shall be deemed to have been incorrect in a manner that materially and adversely
affects the Certificateholders.

                                  ARTICLE FOUR

                    ADMINISTRATION AND SERVICING OF CONTRACTS

      Section 4.01. Duties of Master Servicer. The Master Servicer, acting alone
or through one or more Subservicers as provided in this Section, shall, as agent
for the Indenture Trustee and the Owner Trustee, manage, service, administer and
make collections on the Contracts. The Master Servicer agrees that its servicing
of the Contracts shall be carried out in accordance with customary and usual
procedures of financial institutions which service motor vehicle retail
installment sales contracts and installment loans and, to the extent more
exacting, the procedures used by the Master Servicer in respect of such
contracts serviced by it for its own account. In accordance with the foregoing,
the Master Servicer may, whenever an Obligor has become delinquent or the Master
Servicer believes an Obligor may become delinquent, in order to preserve the
ultimate collectability of amounts due on a Contract, modify the payment
schedule on any Contract by reducing the APR on such Contract without the
consent of any Rating Agency; provided, however, that the new APR shall not be
less than the sum of (i) the Class D Rate and (ii) the Servicing Fee Percent. In
addition, in order to preserve the Trust Estate, the Master Servicer may,
without the consent of any Rating Agency, reduce the principal amount of a
Contract (i.e., write-down a portion of the principal amount due on such
Contract and, accordingly, lower the Monthly P&I on such Contract) to the extent
funds are available in the Spread Account to cover such reduction; provided,
however, the total amount of such modifications pursuant to the immediately
preceding sentence and this sentence and reductions (i) may not affect more than
1% of the Original Pool Balance through the Distribution Date nine months prior
to the Class D Final Scheduled Distribution Date and (ii) during a Collection
Period shall not affect Contracts having an aggregate Principal Balance greater
than 0.1% of the Aggregate Principal Balance at the beginning of such Collection
Period. Any such modifications or reductions exceeding such limits may be made
only with the consent of each Rating Agency. The Master Servicer may also extend
the Maturity Date on a Contract in accordance with Section 4.02. The Master
Servicer's duties shall include collection and posting of all payments,
responding to inquiries of Obligors on the Contracts, investigating
delinquencies, sending payment coupons to Obligors, reporting tax information to
Obligors, accounting for collections, furnishing monthly and annual statements
to the Indenture Trustee and the Owner Trustee with respect to distributions and
filing applicable United States tax returns for the Issuer on an annual basis,
based on a tax year for the Issuer that is the calendar year. The Master
Servicer shall have, subject to the terms hereof, full power and authority,
acting alone, and subject only to the specific requirements and prohibitions of
this Agreement, to do any and all things in connection with such managing,
servicing, administration and collection that it may deem necessary or
desirable; provided, however, that the Master Servicer shall commence
repossession efforts in respect of any Financed Vehicle respecting which the
related Contract is four or more months delinquent. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, but subject to the provisions of this Agreement,
the Master Servicer is authorized and empowered by the Indenture Trustee and the
Owner Trustee to execute and deliver, on behalf of itself, the Trust, the
Noteholders, the Certificateholders, the Indenture Trustee, the Owner Trustee or
any of them, any and all instruments of satisfaction or cancellation, or of
partial or full release or discharge, and all other comparable instruments, with
respect to the Contracts or to the Financed Vehicles. The Owner Trustee shall
furnish the Master Servicer all documents necessary or appropriate to enable the
Master Servicer to carry out its servicing and administrative duties hereunder.


                                       35
<PAGE>

      On the Closing Date, the Master Servicer shall deliver to the Indenture
Trustee and the Owner Trustee a list of Servicing Officers involved in, or
responsible for, the administration and servicing of the Contracts, which list
shall from time to time be updated by the Master Servicer on request of the
Owner Trustee or the Indenture Trustee.

      The Master Servicer may enter into Subservicing Agreements with one or
more Subservicers approved by the Indenture Trustee for the servicing and
administration of certain of the Contracts (including holding the related
Contract Files as custodian). The Master Servicer shall notify each Rating
Agency promptly if a Subservicer is hired. References herein to actions taken or
to be taken by the Master Servicer in servicing the Contracts include actions
taken or to be taken by a Subservicer on behalf of the Master Servicer. Each
Subservicing Agreement will be upon such terms and conditions as are not
inconsistent with this Agreement and as the Master Servicer and the Subservicer
have agreed. With the approval of the Master Servicer, a Subservicer may
delegate its servicing obligations to third-party servicers, but such
Subservicer will remain obligated under the related Subservicing Agreement. The
Master Servicer and a Subservicer may enter into amendments thereto or different
forms of Subservicing Agreements; provided, however, that any such amendments or
different forms shall be consistent with and not violate the provisions of this
Agreement or materially adversely affect the rights of Noteholders or
Certificateholders hereunder.

      The Master Servicer shall be entitled to terminate any Subservicing
Agreement that may exist in accordance with the terms and conditions of such
Subservicing Agreement and without any limitation by virtue of this Agreement;
provided, however, that in the event of termination of any Subservicing
Agreement by the Master Servicer or the related Subservicer, the Master Servicer
shall either act directly as servicer of the related Contract or enter into a
Subservicing Agreement with a successor Subservicer approved by the Indenture
Trustee which will be bound by the terms of the related Subservicing Agreement.

      Notwithstanding any Subservicing Agreement, any of the provisions of this
Agreement relating to agreements or arrangements between the Master Servicer or
a Subservicer or reference to actions taken through such Persons or otherwise,
the Master Servicer shall remain obligated and liable to the Indenture Trustee,
the Owner Trustee and the Securityholders for the servicing and administering of
the Contracts in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement without
diminution of such obligation or liability by virtue of such Subservicing
Agreements or arrangements or by virtue of indemnification from a Subservicer
and to the same extent and under the same terms and conditions as if the Master
Servicer alone were servicing and administering the Contracts. The Master
Servicer shall be entitled to enter into an agreement with a Subservicer for
indemnification of the Master Servicer and nothing contained in this Agreement
shall be deemed to limit or modify such indemnification.

      Any Subservicing Agreement that may be entered into and any other
transactions or servicing arrangements relating to the Contracts involving a
Subservicer or an Affiliate of the Master Servicer in its capacity as such, and
not as an originator of Contracts, shall be deemed to be between the Subservicer
or such Affiliate, as the case may be, and the Master Servicer alone, and none
of the Indenture Trustee, the Owner Trustee, the Noteholders nor the
Certificateholders shall be deemed parties thereto and shall have no claims,
rights, obligations, duties or liabilities with respect to the Subservicer
except as set forth in the immediately succeeding paragraph.


                                       36
<PAGE>

      In the event the Master Servicer shall for any reason no longer be acting
as servicer under this Agreement (including by reason of a Servicer Default),
the Indenture Trustee or its designee may, at the sole discretion of the
Indenture Trustee, thereupon assume all of the rights and obligations of such
Master Servicer under each Subservicing Agreement selected by the Indenture
Trustee in its sole discretion. In such event, the Indenture Trustee, its
designee or the successor servicer for the Indenture Trustee shall be deemed to
have assumed all of the Master Servicer's interest therein and to have replaced
the Master Servicer as a party to each such Subservicing Agreement to the same
extent as if such Subservicing Agreement had been assigned to the assuming party
except that the Master Servicer shall not thereby be relieved of any liability
or obligations under the Subservicing Agreement. The Master Servicer shall, upon
request of the Indenture Trustee but at the expense of the Master Servicer,
deliver to the assuming party all documents and records relating to each such
Subservicing Agreement and the Contracts then being serviced and an accounting
of amounts collected and held by it and otherwise use its best efforts to effect
the orderly and efficient transfer of the Subservicing Agreement to the assuming
party.

      The Master Servicer shall deposit in or credit to the Collection Account
within two Business Days of receipt all collections of Monthly P&I received
after the Cut-Off Date on or in respect of the Contracts together with the
proceeds of all Prepayments and any accompanying interest; provided, however,
that, to the extent any such installment of Monthly P&I or any such Prepayment
proceeds are received in respect of a Contract as to which there is an
outstanding and unreimbursed Advance or Advances, such installment or proceeds
shall, to the extent of any such unreimbursed Advance or Advances, be retained
by the Master Servicer in reimbursement of itself. The Master Servicer shall
likewise deposit in the Collection Account within two Business Days of receipt
all Net Liquidation Proceeds and Net Insurance Proceeds after deducting
therefrom the amount of any outstanding and unreimbursed Advances made by it in
respect of such Contract. The foregoing notwithstanding, the Master Servicer
may, in the event it determines that it has made a Nonrecoverable Advance or
Advances, reimburse itself from unrelated installments of Monthly P&I or
Prepayment proceeds to the extent it shall, concurrently with the withholding of
any such installment or proceeds from deposit in or credit to the Collection
Account as required above, furnish to the Indenture Trustee and the Owner
Trustee a certificate of a Servicing Officer setting forth the basis for the
Master Servicer's determination, the amount of and Contract with respect to
which such Nonrecoverable Advance was made and the installment or installments
or other proceeds respecting which reimbursement has been taken; provided,
however, that the Master Servicer must provide such certificate within three
months of such Nonrecoverable Advance or Advances. The foregoing requirements
for deposit in the Collection Account are exclusive, it being understood that
collections in the nature of late payment charges or extension fees or
collections allocable to payments to be made by the Master Servicer on behalf of
Obligors for payment of insurance premiums or similar items need not be
deposited in the Collection Account and may be retained by the Master Servicer
as additional servicing compensation or for application on behalf of Obligors,
as the case may be.

      With respect to payments of Monthly P&I made by Obligors to the Master
Servicer's lock box, the Master Servicer shall direct the Person maintaining the
lock box to deposit the amount collected on or in respect of the Contracts to
the Collection Account.


                                       37
<PAGE>

      In those cases where a Subservicer is servicing a Contract pursuant to a
Subservicing Agreement, the Master Servicer shall cause the Subservicer to remit
to the Master Servicer for deposit in the Collection Account, on a daily basis,
within two Business Days after receipt by the Subservicer, all proceeds of
Contracts and all Net Liquidation Proceeds and Net Insurance Proceeds received
by the Subservicer.

      In order to facilitate the servicing of the Contracts by the Master
Servicer, the Master Servicer shall retain, subject to and only to the extent
permitted by the provisions of this Agreement, all collections on or in respect
of the Contracts prior to the time they are remitted or credited, in accordance
with such provisions, to the Collection Account, as the case may be. The Master
Servicer acknowledges that the unremitted collections on the Contracts are part
of the Trust Estate and the Master Servicer agrees to act as custodian and
bailee of the Indenture Trustee and the Owner Trustee in holding such monies and
collections. The Master Servicer agrees, for the benefit of the Indenture
Trustee, the Owner Trustee and the Securityholders, to act as such custodian and
bailee, and to hold and deal with such monies and such collections, as custodian
and bailee for the Indenture Trustee and the Owner Trustee, in accordance with
the provisions of this Agreement.

      The Master Servicer shall retain all data (including, without limitation,
computerized records) relating directly to or maintained in connection with the
servicing of the Contracts at the address of the Master Servicer set forth as
Schedule B to this Agreement, at the office of any Subservicer or, upon 15 days'
notice to the Indenture Trustee and the Owner Trustee, at such other place where
the servicing offices of the Master Servicer are located, and shall give the
Indenture Trustee and the Owner Trustee access to all data at all reasonable
times. While a Servicer Default shall be continuing, the Master Servicer shall,
on demand of the Indenture Trustee or the Owner Trustee, deliver or cause to be
delivered to the Indenture Trustee or the Owner Trustee, as the case may be, all
data (including, without limitation, computerized records and, to the extent
transferable, related operating software) necessary for the servicing of the
Contracts and all monies collected by it and required to be deposited in or
credited to the Collection Account.

      The Master Servicer shall, or cause the Administrator to, prepare, execute
and deliver all certificates or other documents required to be delivered by the
Trust pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 or the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder.

      Section 4.02. Collection of Contract Payments. The Master Servicer shall
use its best efforts to collect all payments called for under the terms and
provisions of the Contracts as and when the same shall become due and shall use
its best efforts to cause each Obligor to make all payments in respect of his or
her Contract to the Master Servicer. Consistent with the foregoing, the Master
Servicer may in its discretion (i) waive any late payment charges in connection
with delinquent payments on a Contract or prepayment charges and (ii) in order
to work out a default or an impending default due to the financial condition of
the Obligor, modify the payment schedule of a Delinquent Contract (subject to
the next sentence) or extend the Maturity Date of a Delinquent Contract by up to
90 days in the aggregate past the originally scheduled date of the last payment
on such Contract; provided, however, the Master Servicer shall not defer
payments more than three times over the life of such Contract; provided,
further, that in the case of any extension granted pursuant to clause (ii) the
Master Servicer makes an Advance in respect of


                                       38
<PAGE>

such extension and in no event can the last payment on such Contract be extended
beyond the last day of the Collection Period ending immediately prior to the
Class D Final Scheduled Distribution Date. The Master Servicer shall not extend
the Maturity Date of a Contract except as provided in clause (ii) of the
preceding sentence and shall not modify any Contracts except in accordance with
the criteria and limitations specified in Section 4.01.

      Section 4.03. Realization upon Defaulted Contracts and Liquidated
Contracts. The Master Servicer shall use its best efforts, consistent with the
servicing standard specified in Section 4.01, to repossess or otherwise convert
the ownership of the Financed Vehicle securing any Contract as to which no
satisfactory arrangements can be made for collection of delinquent payments.
Such servicing procedures may include reasonable efforts to realize upon any
recourse to Dealers and selling the Financed Vehicle at public or private sale.
In connection with such repossession or other conversion, the Master Servicer
shall follow such practices and procedures as it shall deem necessary or
advisable and as shall be normal and usual for prudent holders of motor vehicle
retail installment sales contracts and installment loans and as shall be in
compliance with all applicable laws, and, in connection with the repossession of
any Financed Vehicle or any Contract in default, may commence and prosecute any
proceedings in respect of such Contract in its own name or, if the Master
Servicer deems it necessary, in the name of the Owner Trustee or on behalf of
the Owner Trustee. The Master Servicer's obligations under this Section are
subject to the provision that, in the case of damage to a Financed Vehicle from
an uninsured cause, the Master Servicer shall not be required to expend its own
funds in repairing such Financed Vehicle unless it shall determine (i) that such
restoration will increase the proceeds of liquidation of the related Contract,
after reimbursement to itself for such expenses, and (ii) that such expenses
will be recoverable by it either as Liquidation Expenses or as expenses
recoverable under an applicable Insurance Policy. In the event that the Master
Servicer determines that, in its best judgment, further collection efforts by it
as to a Liquidated Contract will not result in the realization of additional Net
Liquidation Proceeds to the Trust, the Master Servicer may, in the name of the
Owner Trustee, and for the benefit of the Trust, sell the Liquidated Contract to
any party not affiliated with the Master Servicer free and clear of the rights
of the Issuer. The Master Servicer shall be responsible for all other costs and
expenses incurred by it in connection with any action taken in respect of a
Defaulted Contract; provided, however, that it shall be entitled to
reimbursement of such costs and expenses to the extent they constitute
Liquidation Expenses or expenses recoverable under an applicable Insurance
Policy. All Net Liquidation Proceeds, Net Insurance Proceeds and proceeds of the
sale of Contracts hereunder shall be deposited directly in or credited to the
Collection Account (without deposit in any intervening account) to the extent
required by Section 5.02.

      Section 4.04. Insurance. To the extent the Obligor fails to maintain a
comprehensive and collision insurance policy in an amount at least equal to the
lesser of (i) the actual cash value of the Financed Vehicle or (ii) the
principal amount due from the Obligor under the related Contract, the Master
Servicer shall obtain the LDI Policy in respect of such Financed Vehicle;
provided, however, that the Master Servicer shall not be required to maintain
such insurance in respect of any Financed Vehicle as to which the related
Contract has an unpaid principal balance of less than $4,000 or the related
Contract has six or fewer months remaining before its Maturity Date.


                                       39
<PAGE>

      Section 4.05. Maintenance of Security Interests in Financed Vehicles. The
Master Servicer shall take such steps as are necessary to maintain continuous
perfection and priority of the security interest created by each Contract in the
related Financed Vehicle, including obtaining the execution by the Obligors and
the recording, registering, filing, re-recording, re-registering and refiling of
all security agreements, financing statements, continuation statements or other
instruments as are necessary to maintain the security interest granted by
Obligors under the respective Contracts. The Owner Trustee and the Indenture
Trustee each hereby authorizes the Master Servicer to take such steps as are
necessary to re-perfect such security interest on behalf of the Issuer in the
event of the relocation of a Financed Vehicle or for any other reason.

      Section 4.06. Covenants, Representations and Warranties of the Master
Servicer. The Master Servicer hereby makes the following covenants,
representations and warranties on which the Issuer is deemed to have relied in
acquiring the Contracts. Such covenants, representations and warranties speak as
of the execution and delivery of this Agreement and as of the Closing Date, but
shall survive the sale, transfer and assignment of the Contracts to the Issuer
and the pledge thereof to the Indenture Trustee pursuant to the Indenture.

      (a) The Master Servicer covenants as to the Contracts:

                  (i) Lien in Force. The Financed Vehicle securing each Contract
      shall not be released from the lien granted by the Contract in whole or in
      part, except as contemplated herein.

                  (ii) Impairment. The Master Servicer shall not impair the
      rights of the Noteholders and Certificateholders in the Contracts.

                  (iii) Amendments. The Master Servicer shall not amend the
      terms of any Contract, except that extensions or modifications may be
      granted in accordance with Section 4.02.

                  (iv) Transfers. The Master Servicer may consent to the sale or
      transfer by an Obligor of any Financed Vehicle only if the original
      Obligor under the related Contract remains liable under such Contract and
      the transferee assumes all of the Obligor's obligations thereunder.

                  (v) Security Interest. The Master Servicer shall maintain the
      perfection and priority of the Issuer's and the Indenture Trustee's
      security interests in the Contracts.

      (b) The Master Servicer represents, warrants and covenants:

                  (i) Organization and Good Standing. The Master Servicer (A)
      has been duly organized and is validly existing as a corporation in good
      standing under the laws of the State of California, (B) has qualified to
      do business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing in each
      jurisdiction where the character of its properties or the nature of its
      activities makes such qualification necessary and (C) has full power,


                                       40
<PAGE>

      authority and legal right to own its property, to carry on its business as
      presently conducted and to enter into and perform its obligations under
      this Agreement.

                  (ii) Power and Authority. The execution and delivery by the
      Master Servicer of this Agreement are within the corporate power of the
      Master Servicer and have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate
      action on the part of the Master Servicer. Neither the execution and
      delivery of this Agreement, nor the consummation of the transactions
      herein contemplated, nor compliance with the provisions hereof, will
      conflict with or result in a breach of, or constitute a default under, any
      of the provisions of any law, governmental rule, regulation, judgment,
      decree or order binding on the Master Servicer or its properties or the
      articles of incorporation or bylaws of the Master Servicer, or any of the
      provisions of any indenture, mortgage, contract or other instrument to
      which the Master Servicer is a party or by which it is bound or result in
      the creation or imposition of any lien, charge or encumbrance upon any of
      its property pursuant to the terms of any such indenture, mortgage,
      contract or other instrument.

                  (iii) Governmental Consents. The Master Servicer is not
      required to obtain the consent of any other party or consent, license,
      approval or authorization, or registration or declaration with, any
      governmental authority, bureau or agency in connection with the execution,
      delivery, performance, validity or enforceability of this Agreement,
      except (in each case) such as have been obtained and are in full force and
      effect.

                  (iv) Binding Obligation. This Agreement has been duly executed
      and delivered by the Master Servicer and, assuming the due authorization,
      execution and delivery thereof by the Owner Trustee and the Indenture
      Trustee, constitutes a legal, valid and binding instrument enforceable
      against the Master Servicer in accordance with its terms (subject to
      applicable bankruptcy and insolvency laws and other similar laws affecting
      the enforcement of creditors' rights generally).

                  (v) No Proceedings. There are no actions, suits or proceedings
      pending or, to the knowledge of the Master Servicer, threatened against or
      affecting the Master Servicer, before or by any court, administrative
      agency, arbitrator or governmental body with respect to any of the
      transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or which will, if determined
      adversely to the Master Servicer, materially and adversely affect it or
      its business, assets, operations or condition, financial or otherwise, or
      adversely affect the Master Servicer's ability to perform its obligations
      hereunder. The Master Servicer is not in default with respect to any order
      of any court, administrative agency, arbitrator or governmental body so as
      to materially and adversely affect the transactions contemplated by the
      above-mentioned documents.

                  (vi) Other Consents. The Master Servicer has obtained or made
      all necessary consents, approvals, waivers and notifications of creditors,
      lessors and other nongovernmental persons, in each case in connection with
      the execution and delivery of, and the consummation of the transactions
      contemplated by, this Agreement.

      Section 4.07. Repurchase of Contracts upon Breach of Covenant. The Master
Servicer or the Owner Trustee shall inform the other party and the Indenture
Trustee promptly, in writing, upon the discovery of any breach pursuant to
Section 4.02, 4.05 or 4.06. Unless the breach shall have been cured within 30
days following such discovery, the Master Servicer shall purchase any Contract
materially and adversely affected by such breach. In consideration of the
purchase of such Contract, the Master Servicer shall remit the Repurchase Amount
in the manner specified in Section 5.04. The sole remedy of the Issuer, the
Owner Trustee, the Indenture Trustee, the Certificateholders or the Noteholders
with respect to a breach pursuant to Section 4.02, 4.05 or 4.06 shall be to
require the Master Servicer to purchase Contracts pursuant to this Section;
provided, however, that the Master Servicer shall indemnify the Owner Trustee,
the Indenture Trustee, the Issuer and the Securityholders against all costs,
expenses, losses, damages, claims and liabilities, including reasonable fees and
expenses of counsel, which may be asserted against or incurred by any of them as
a result of third-party claims arising out of the events or facts giving rise to
such breach. The Owner Trustee shall have no duty to conduct any affirmative
investigation as to the occurrence of any condition requiring the repurchase of
any Contract pursuant to this Section.

      Section 4.08. Servicing Compensation. As compensation for the performance
of its obligations under this Agreement and subject to the terms of this
Section, the Master Servicer shall be entitled to receive on each Distribution
Date the Servicing Fee. As servicing compensation in addition to the Servicing
Fee, the Master Servicer shall be entitled to retain all late payment charges,
extension fees and similar items paid in respect of the Contracts. The Master
Servicer shall pay all expenses incurred by it in connection with its servicing
activities hereunder and shall not be entitled to reimbursement of such expenses
except to the extent provided in Section 4.03.

      Section 4.09. Reporting by the Master Servicer.

      (a) On each Master Servicer Report Date, the Master Servicer shall
transmit to the Owner Trustee, the Indenture Trustee, the Backup Servicer and
each Rating Agency a statement, substantially in the form of Exhibit B (the
"Distribution Date Statement"), setting forth with respect to the next
succeeding Distribution Date:

                  (i) the Interest Distributable Amount for each Class of Notes;

                  (ii) the Class A Principal Distributable Amount, the Class B
      Principal Distributable Amount, the Class C Principal Distributable Amount
      and the Class D Principal Distributable Amount for such Distribution Date;

                  (i) the amount of principal actually distributed to each Class
      of Noteholders on such Distribution Date;

                  (ii) with respect to each Class of Notes, the excess, if any,
      of the Aggregate Principal Distributable Amount over the amount of
      principal actually distributed on the Notes on such Distribution Date;

                  (iii) the Net Collections for such Distribution Date;


                                       42
<PAGE>

                  (iv) the amount to be on deposit in the Spread Account on such
      Distribution Date, before and after giving effect to deposits thereto and
      withdrawals therefrom to be made in respect of such Distribution Date;

                  (v) the Servicing Fee with respect to the related Collection
      Period;

                  (vi) the amount of any Interest Carryover Shortfall on such
      Distribution Date and the change in such amounts from those with respect
      to the immediately preceding Distribution Date;

                  (vii) the aggregate amount of Monthly P&I which was due on the
      Contracts during the related Collection Period and was delinquent as of
      the end of the related Collection Period (any such payment of Monthly P&I
      being presumed to be delinquent to the extent that it was not deposited in
      or credited to the Collection Account during such Collection Period);

Servicer shall immediately notify the Indenture Trustee and the Owner Trustee if

          DISTRIBUTIONS; SPREAD ACCOUNT; STATEMENTS TO SECURITYHOLDERS

      Section 5.01. Establishment of Trust Accounts.

      (a) Prior to the Closing Date, the Master Servicer shall open, at a
depository institution (which may be the Indenture Trustee or the Bank), the
following accounts (the "Trust Accounts"):

                  (i) an account in the name of the Indenture Trustee (the
      "Collection Account"), bearing a designation clearly indicating that the
      funds deposited therein are held for the benefit of the Securityholders;

                  (ii) an account in the name of the Indenture Trustee (the
      "Spread Account"), bearing a designation clearly indicating that the funds
      deposited therein are held for the benefit of the Securityholders;

                  (iii) an account in the name of the Indenture Trustee (the
      "Note Distribution Account") bearing a designation clearly indicating that
      the funds deposited therein are held for the benefit of the Noteholders;
      and

                  (iv) an account in the name of the Owner Trustee (the
      "Certificate Distribution Account") bearing a designation clearly
      indicating that the funds deposited therein are held for the benefit of
      the Certificateholders.

      The Trust Accounts shall be Eligible Accounts and relate solely to the
Securities and to the Contracts and Eligible Investments. The Master Servicer
shall give the Indenture Trustee and the Owner Trustee at least five Business
Days' written notice of any change in the location of any Trust Account and any
related account identification information. All monies deposited in or credited
to, from time to time, the Trust Accounts shall be part of the Trust Estate and
all monies deposited in or credited to, from time to time, the Collection
Account, the Spread Account, the Certificate Distribution Account and the Note
Distribution Account shall be invested by the Indenture Trustee in Eligible
Investments pursuant to Section 5.01(b).

      (b) All funds in the Collection Account, the Spread Account, the Note
Distribution Account and the Certificate Distribution Account shall be invested
by the Indenture Trustee in Eligible Investments. Unless and until the RIC is no
longer an Eligible Investment, all funds in such Trust Accounts, in each case
that are available for investment in Eligible Investments, shall be invested in
the RIC; provided, however, that funds in the Spread Account, the Note
Distribution Account and the Certificate Distribution Account may only be
invested in the RIC with the consent of Moody's. If the RIC is no longer an
Eligible Investment then, subject to the limitations set forth herein, the
Master Servicer shall direct the Indenture Trustee in writing to invest funds in
the foregoing Trust Accounts in Eligible Investments, other than the RIC. All
such investments shall be in the name of the Indenture Trustee for the benefit
of the Noteholders and the Certificateholders, as applicable. All income or
other gain from investment of monies deposited in or credited to the Collection
Account (including without limitation the RIC Reinvestment Earnings) shall be
deposited in or credited to the Collection Account immediately


                                       47
<PAGE>

upon receipt, and any loss resulting from such investment shall be charged to
the Collection Account. All income or other gain from investment of monies
deposited in or credited to the Spread Account (including without limitation the
RIC Reinvestment Earnings) shall be deposited in or credited to the Spread
Account immediately upon receipt, and any loss resulting from such investment
shall be charged to the Spread Account. All income or other gain from investment
of monies deposited in or credited to the Note Distribution Account (including
without limitation the RIC Reinvestment Earnings) shall be deposited in or
credited to the Note Distribution Account immediately upon receipt, and any loss
resulting from such investment shall be charged to the Note Distribution
Account. All income or other gain from investment of monies deposited in or
credited to the Certificate Distribution Account (including without limitation
the RIC Reinvestment Earnings) shall be deposited in or credited to the
Certificate Distribution Account immediately upon receipt, and any loss
resulting from such investment shall be charged to the Certificate Distribution
Account. The maximum permissible maturities of any investments of funds in the
Collection Account, the Spread Account, the Note Distribution Account and the
Certificate Distribution Account on any date shall not be later than one
Business Day immediately preceding the Distribution Date next succeeding the
date of such investment; provided, however, that such funds may be invested by
the Indenture Trustee in Eligible Investments (other than the RIC) that mature
on the Business Day before the Distribution Date. No investment in Eligible
Investments may be sold prior to its maturity.

      (c) (i) The Indenture Trustee shall possess all right, title and interest
in all funds on deposit from time to time in the Trust Accounts and in all
proceeds thereof (including all income thereon) and all such funds, investments,
proceeds and income shall be part of the Trust Estate. The Trust Accounts, other
than the Certificate Distribution Account, shall be under the sole dominion and
control of the Indenture Trustee for the benefit of the Noteholders and the
Certificateholders, as the case may be. The Certificate Distribution Account
shall be in the name of the Owner Trustee for the benefit of the
Certificateholders. If, at any time, any of the Trust Accounts ceases to be an
Eligible Account, the Indenture Trustee (or the Master Servicer on its behalf)
shall within ten Business Days (or such longer period, not to exceed 30 calendar
days, as to which each Rating Agency may consent) establish a new Trust Account
as an Eligible Account and shall transfer any cash or any investments to such
new Trust Account.

            (ii) With respect to the Trust Account Property, the Indenture
Trustee agrees, by its acceptance hereof, that:

                  (A) any Trust Account Property that is held in deposit
            accounts shall be held solely in the Eligible Accounts, subject to
            the last sentence of Section 5.01(c)(i); and each such Eligible
            Account shall be subject to the exclusive custody and continuous
            control of the Indenture Trustee within the meaning of Section
            9-104(a) of the applicable UCC, and the Indenture Trustee shall have
            sole signature authority with respect thereto;

                  (B) any Trust Account Property that constitutes Physical
            Property shall be delivered to the Indenture Trustee in accordance
            with paragraph (i) of the definition of the term "Delivery" and
            shall be held, pending maturity or disposition, solely by the
            Indenture Trustee or a Financial Intermediary acting solely for the
            Indenture Trustee;


                                       48
<PAGE>

                  (C) any Trust Account Property that is a book-entry security
            held through the Federal Reserve System pursuant to federal
            book-entry regulations shall be delivered in accordance with
            paragraph (ii) of the definition of the term "Delivery" and shall be
            maintained by the Indenture Trustee, pending maturity or
            disposition, through continued book-entry registration of such Trust
            Account Property as described in such paragraph; and

                  (D) any Trust Account Property that is an "uncertificated
            security" under Article Eight of the UCC and that is not governed by
            clause (C) above shall be delivered to the Indenture Trustee in
            accordance with paragraph (iii) of the definition of the term
            "Delivery" and shall be maintained by the Indenture Trustee, pending
            maturity or disposition, through continued registration of the
            Indenture Trustee's (or its nominee's) ownership of such security.

            (iii) The Master Servicer shall have the power, revocable by the
Indenture Trustee or by the Owner Trustee with the consent of the Indenture
Trustee, to instruct the Indenture Trustee to make withdrawals and payments from
the Trust Accounts for the purpose of permitting the Master Servicer or the
Owner Trustee to carry out its respective duties hereunder or permitting the
Indenture Trustee to carry out its duties under the Indenture.

      Section 5.02. Collections; Net Deposits.

      (a) Subject to Section 5.03 and subsection (b) hereof, the Master Servicer
shall remit or credit all payments by the Obligors on the Contracts, all
payments on behalf of Obligors on the Contracts and all Net Liquidation Proceeds
and Net Insurance Proceeds to the Collection Account (within two Business Days
as specified in Section 4.01); provided that the Master Servicer shall retain
from collection of late payments and Net Liquidation Proceeds or Net Insurance
Proceeds in respect of a Contract an amount equal to previously unreimbursed
Advances in respect of such Contract made pursuant to Section 5.04.

      (b) So long as the Master Servicer is WFS, the Master Servicer shall have
the right, on a basis not more frequently than once per month (although deposits
shall be made into the Collection Account within two Business Days pursuant to
Section 4.01), to deduct from amounts received that are otherwise required to be
deposited in or credited to the Collection Account and, to the extent such
amounts are insufficient, to require that the Indenture Trustee withdraw and
deliver to it from the Collection Account, amounts due to be paid hereunder to
the Master Servicer or to the Seller after giving effect to application of the
payment priorities specified in this Article for the month (or other applicable
period), and to pay such amounts to itself as Master Servicer or to the Seller,
as the case may be. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Master Servicer shall
maintain the records and accounts for such deposits and credits on a gross
basis.

      Section 5.03. Application of Collections. On or prior to the last day of
each Collection Period, all collections for each such Collection Period shall be
applied by the Master Servicer as follows: with respect to each Contract
(including a Defaulted Contract), payments by or on behalf of an Obligor shall
be applied first to late payment and extension fees, second to interest accrued
on the Contract, third to principal due on the Contract and fourth to
administrative charges, if any. Any excess shall be applied to prepay the
principal balance of the Contract.

      Section 5.04. Advances and Nonrecoverable Advances; Repurchase Amounts.

Monthly P&I due under any Contract (other than a Liquidated Contract)
Outstanding at the end of such Collection Period shall not have been received by
the Master Servicer and deposited in or credited to the Collection Account
pursuant to Section 5.02(a), the Master Servicer shall make, concurrently with
the furnishing of the related Distribution Date Statement to the Indenture
Trustee and the Owner Trustee, the Advance for such Collection Period by
depositing in or crediting to the Collection Account with respect to each
Contract 30 days of interest on the Principal Balance of such Contract at a rate
equal to the sum of (i) the Class D Rate and (ii) the Servicing Fee Percent for
each month that the related Monthly P&I is delinquent at the end of such
Collection Period. The Master Servicer shall account for such deposit or credit
in accordance with Section 4.01. The foregoing notwithstanding, the Master
Servicer shall not make an Advance in respect of a Contract if the Master
Servicer shall have determined that any such Advance, if made, would constitute
a Nonrecoverable Advance. Any such determination shall be evidenced by an
Officers' Certificate furnished to the Indenture Trustee and the Owner Trustee
setting forth the basis for such determination.

      (b) If the Master Servicer determines that it has made a Nonrecoverable
Advance or Advances, the Master Servicer shall reimburse itself, without
interest, from unrelated installments of Monthly P&I or Prepayment proceeds to
the extent it shall, concurrently with the withholding of any such installment
or proceeds from deposit in or credit to the Collection Account as required by
Section 5.02, furnish to the Indenture Trustee and the Owner Trustee a
certificate of a Servicing Officer setting forth the basis for the Master
Servicer's determination, the amount of, and Contract with respect to which,
such Nonrecoverable Advance was made and the installment or installments or
other proceeds respecting which reimbursement has been taken; provided, however,
that the Master Servicer must provide such certificate within three months of
such Nonrecoverable Advance or Advances.

last day of the related cure period specified in Section 3.02 or 4.07, as the
case may be. In addition, the Master Servicer and the Seller shall deposit or

Seller will keep in full force and effect its existence, rights and franchises
as a corporation under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation and
will obtain and preserve its qualification to do business in each jurisdiction
in which such qualification is or shall be necessary to protect the validity and
enforceability of this Agreement, the other Basic Documents and each other
instrument or agreement necessary or appropriate to the proper administration of
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. In addition, all
transactions and dealings between the Seller and its Affiliates will be
conducted on an arm's-length basis.

      Section 6.02. Liability of Seller; Indemnities. The Seller shall be liable
in accordance herewith only to the extent of the obligations specifically
undertaken by such Seller under this Agreement.

      The Seller shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Issuer, the Owner
Trustee, the Indenture Trustee, the Backup Servicer and the Master Servicer from
and against any taxes that may at any time be asserted against any such Person
with respect to the transactions contemplated herein and in the other Basic
Documents, including any sales, gross receipts, general corporation, tangible
personal property, privilege or license taxes (but, in the case of the Issuer,
not including any taxes asserted with respect to, and as of the date of, the
sale of the Contracts to the Issuer or the issuance and original sale of the
Securities, or asserted with respect to ownership of the Contracts, or federal
or other income taxes arising out of distributions on the Certificates or the
Notes) and costs and expenses in defending against the same.

      The Seller shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Issuer, the Owner
Trustee, the Indenture Trustee, the Backup Servicer and the Securityholders from
and against any loss, liability or expense incurred by reason of such Seller's
willful misfeasance, bad faith or negligence (other than errors in judgment) in
the performance of its duties under this Agreement, or by reason of reckless
disregard of its obligations and duties under this Agreement.

      The Seller shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Issuer, the Owner
Trustee, the Indenture Trustee and the Backup Servicer from and against all
costs, expenses, losses, claims, damages and liabilities arising out of or
incurred in connection with the acceptance or performance of the trusts and
duties herein and, in the case of the Owner Trustee, in the Trust Agreement and,
in the case of the Indenture Trustee, in the Indenture, except to the extent
that such cost, expense, loss, claim, damage or liability, in the case of (i)
the Owner Trustee, shall be due to the willful misfeasance, bad faith or
negligence of the Owner Trustee or shall arise from the breach by the Owner
Trustee of any of its representations or warranties set forth in Section 7.03 of
the Trust Agreement, (ii) the Indenture Trustee, shall be due to the willful
misfeasance, bad faith or negligence of the Indenture Trustee or (iii) the

payments are made thereafter shall collect any of such amounts from others, such
Person shall promptly repay such amounts to such Seller, without interest.

      Section 6.03. Merger or Consolidation of, or Assumption of the Obligations
of, the Seller; Certain Limitations.

      (a) The Seller shall not consolidate with nor merge into any other
corporation or convey, transfer or lease substantially all of its assets as an
entirety to any Person unless the corporation formed by such consolidation or
into which such Seller has merged or the Person which acquires by conveyance,
transfer or lease substantially all the assets of the Seller as an entirety, can
lawfully perform the obligations of the Seller hereunder and executes and
delivers to the Owner Trustee and the Indenture Trustee an agreement in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to the Owner Trustee and the Indenture
Trustee, which contains an assumption by such successor entity of the due and
punctual performance and observance of each covenant and condition to be
performed or observed by the Seller under this Agreement. The Seller shall
provide notice of any merger, consolidation or succession pursuant to this
Section to each Rating Agency and will deliver to the Owner Trustee and the
Indenture Trustee a letter from each Rating Agency to the effect that such
merger, consolidation or succession will not result in a qualification,
downgrading or withdrawal of its then-current ratings of each Class of Notes.
The Seller and WFS each shall maintain separate corporate offices.

      (b)

                  (i) Subject to clause (b)(ii) below, the purpose of the Seller

      series of obligations, consisting of one or more classes of notes,
      certificates or other securities (the "Offered Securities") that are

      rated in an investment grade category by at least one nationally
      recognized statistical rating agency; and (C) to negotiate, authorize,
      execute, deliver and assume the obligations of any agreement relating to

      credit support agreement, receivables purchase agreement or underwriting
      agreement or to engage in any lawful activity which is incidental to the
      activities contemplated by any such agreement. So long as any outstanding
      debt of the Seller or Offered Securities are rated by any nationally
      recognized statistical rating organization, such Seller shall not issue
      notes or otherwise incur debt unless (1) the Seller has made a written
      request to the related nationally recognized statistical rating
      organization to issue notes or incur borrowings which notes or borrowings
      are rated by the related nationally

      are nonrecourse against any assets of the Seller other than the assets
      pledged to secure such notes or borrowings, (b) do not constitute a claim
      against the Seller in the event such assets are insufficient to pay such
      notes or borrowings and (c) where such notes or borrowings are secured by
      the rated debt or Offered Securities, are fully subordinated (and which
      shall provide for payment only after payment in respect of all outstanding
      rated debt or Offered Securities) to such rated debt or Offered
      Securities.

      (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section and any provision
of law, the Seller shall not do any of the following:

                  (i) engage in any business or activity other than as set forth
      in clause (b) above;

                  (ii) without the affirmative vote of a majority of the members

      director may be required by any shareholder of the Seller to consent to
      the institution of bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings against the Seller
      so long as it is solvent; or

                  (iii) merge or consolidate with any other corporation, company
      or entity or sell all or substantially all of its assets or acquire all or
      substantially all of the assets or capital stock or other ownership

      acquisition of Vehicle Receivables and the sale of Vehicle Receivables to
      one or more trusts in accordance with the terms of clause (b)(ii) above,
      which shall not be otherwise restricted by Section 6.03(c)).

any director or officer or employee or agent of the Seller may rely in good
faith on any document of any kind, prima facie properly executed and submitted
by any Person respecting any matters arising hereunder. The Seller and any

the Owner Trustee or the Indenture Trustee, as the case may be, for any
contractual damages, liability or expense incurred by reason of the Owner
Trustee's or the Indenture Trustee's willful misfeasance, bad faith or
negligence (except for errors in judgment) in the performance of their
respective duties hereunder, or by reason of reckless disregard of their
respective obligations and duties hereunder. The Seller shall not be under any

thereof shall have an equal and proportionate benefit under the provisions of
this Agreement, without preference, priority or distinction as among all of the

      (a) The Master Servicer shall not resign from the duties and obligations
hereby imposed on it except upon determination by its board of directors that by
reason of change in applicable legal requirements the continued performance by
the Master Servicer of its duties hereunder would cause it to be in violation of
such legal requirements in a manner which would result in a material adverse
effect on the Master Servicer or its financial condition, said determination to
be evidenced by a resolution of its board of directors to such effect
accompanied by an Opinion of Counsel, satisfactory to the Owner Trustee and the
Indenture

until (i) a new servicer acceptable to the Owner Trustee and the Indenture
Trustee is willing to service the Contracts and enters into a servicing
agreement with the Issuer in form and substance substantially similar to this
Agreement and satisfactory to the Owner Trustee and the Indenture Trustee and
(ii) each Rating Agency confirms that the selection of such new servicer will
not result in the qualification, reduction or withdrawal of its then-current
rating of each Class of Notes assigned by such Rating Agency. No such
resignation shall affect the obligation of the Master Servicer to repurchase
Contracts pursuant to Section 4.07.

Servicer may not assign this Agreement or any of its rights, powers, duties or
obligations hereunder; provided that the Master Servicer may assign this

obligations of the Master Servicer under this Agreement shall continue until
this Agreement shall have been terminated as provided in Section 9.01 or the

Agreement, and shall survive the exercise by the Owner Trustee or the Indenture

Owner Trustee, the Indenture Trustee or any Certificateholder or Noteholder of
any provision of the Notes, the Certificates or this Agreement.

      (a) Neither the Master Servicer nor any of the directors, officers,
employees or agents of the Master Servicer shall be under any liability to the
Issuer, the Noteholders or the Certificateholders, except as provided under this
Agreement, for any action taken or for refraining from the taking of any action
pursuant to this Agreement or for errors in judgment; provided, however, that

bad faith or negligence (except errors in judgment) in the performance of duties
or by reason of reckless disregard of obligations and duties under this

negligence (except errors in judgment) in the performance of such Trustee's
duties under this Agreement or by reason of reckless disregard of its
obligations and duties under this Agreement.

      Except as provided in this Agreement, the Master Servicer shall not be
under any obligation to appear in, prosecute or defend any legal action that
shall not be incidental to its duties to service the Contracts in accordance
with this Agreement, and that in its opinion may involve it in any expense or
liability; provided, however, that the Master Servicer may undertake any
reasonable action that it may deem necessary or desirable in respect of this
Agreement and the other Basic Documents and the rights and duties of the parties
to this Agreement and the other Basic Documents and the interests of the

      Section 8.01. Servicer Default. If any one of the following events (a
"Servicer Default") shall occur and be continuing:

            (a) any failure by the Master Servicer or the Issuer, to deposit or
      credit, or to deliver to the Indenture Trustee for deposit, in any of the
      Trust Accounts any amount required hereunder to be as deposited, credited
      or delivered or to direct the Indenture Trustee to make any required
      distributions therefrom, that shall continue unremedied for a period of
      three Business Days after written notice of such failure is received from
      the Owner Trustee or the Indenture Trustee or after discovery of such
      failure by an officer of the Master Servicer;

            (b) any failure by the Master Servicer to deliver to the Indenture
      Trustee or the Owner Trustee a report in accordance with Section 4.09 or
      Section 4.10 by the fourth Business Day prior to the Distribution Date
      with respect to which such report is due, or the Master Servicer shall
      have defaulted in the due observance of any provision of Section 7.02
      (other than failure to enter into an assumption agreement under Section
      7.02, which is a Servicer Default only if such failure continues for ten
      Business Days);

            (c) failure on the part of the Seller, the Issuer or the Master
      Servicer duly to observe or to perform in any material respect any other
      covenants or agreements of the Master Servicer or the Seller set forth in
      this Agreement or any other Basic Document, which failure shall (i)
      materially and adversely affect the rights of the Owner Trustee, the
      Indenture Trustee, the Certificateholders or Noteholders and (ii) continue
      unremedied for a period of 30 days after the date on which written notice
      of such failure, requiring the same to be remedied, shall have been given
      (A) to the Master Servicer or the Seller (as the case may be) by the Owner
      Trustee or the Indenture Trustee or (B) to the Master Servicer or the
      Seller (as the case may be), and to the Owner Trustee and the Indenture
      Trustee by the Holders of Notes evidencing not less than 25% of the
      Outstanding Amount of the Notes of the Controlling Class, or, if the Notes
      have been paid in full, by Certificateholders evidencing not less than 25%
      of the aggregate Certificate Percentage Interest;

            (d) the occurrence of an Insolvency Event with respect to the
      Seller, the Issuer or the Master Servicer; or

            (e) any representation, warranty or statement of the Master
      Servicer, the Issuer or the Seller made in this Agreement or any
      certificate, report or other writing delivered pursuant hereto shall prove
      to be incorrect in any material respect as of the time when the same shall
      have been made (excluding, however, any representation or warranty to
      which Section 3.01 or 4.06 shall be applicable so long as the Master
      Servicer or the Seller shall be in compliance with Section 3.02 or 4.07,
      as the case may be), and the incorrectness of such representation,
      warranty or statement has a material adverse effect on the Noteholders or
      the Certificateholders and, within 30 days after written notice


                                       63
<PAGE>

      thereof shall have been given to the Master Servicer or the Seller by the
      Indenture Trustee or the Owner Trustee or by the Holders of Notes
      evidencing not less than 25% of the Outstanding Amount of the Notes of the
      Controlling Class, or Certificateholders evidencing not less than 25% of
      the aggregate Certificate Percentage Interest, the circumstance or
      condition in respect of which such representation, warranty or statement
      was incorrect shall not have been eliminated or otherwise cured;

then, and in each and every case, so long as such Servicer Default shall not
have been remedied, either the Indenture Trustee, the Holders of Notes
evidencing not less than a majority of the Outstanding Amount of the Notes of
the Controlling Class (or, if the Notes have been paid in full and the Indenture
has been discharged in accordance with its terms, by the Owner Trustee or by
Certificateholders evidencing not less than a majority of the aggregate
Certificate Percentage Interest), by notice then given in writing to the Master
Servicer (and to the Indenture Trustee and the Owner Trustee if given by the
Noteholders or the Certificateholders) may terminate all the rights and
obligations of the Master Servicer under this Agreement. Upon such termination
or a termination pursuant to Section 8.06, termination of the Master Servicer as
custodian can be made pursuant to Section 3.07. On or after the receipt by the
Master Servicer of written notice of termination pursuant to this Section or
Section 8.06, all authority and power of the Master Servicer under this
Agreement, whether with respect to the Notes, the Certificates, the Contracts or
otherwise, shall, without further action, pass to and be vested in the Indenture
Trustee, the Backup Servicer or such successor Master Servicer as may be
appointed under Section 8.02, as the case may be; and, without limitation, the
Indenture Trustee and the Owner Trustee are hereby authorized and empowered to
execute and deliver, for the benefit of the predecessor Master Servicer, as
attorney-in-fact or otherwise, any and all documents and other instruments, and
to do or accomplish all other acts or things necessary or appropriate to effect
the purposes of such notice of termination, whether to complete the transfer and
endorsement of the Contracts and related documents, or otherwise. The Master
Servicer shall cooperate with the Indenture Trustee and the Owner Trustee in
effecting the termination of the responsibilities and rights of the predecessor
Master Servicer under this Agreement, including the transfer to the Indenture
Trustee or the Backup Servicer, as the case may be, for administration by it of
all cash amounts that shall at the time be held by the predecessor Master
Servicer for deposit, or shall thereafter be received by it with respect to any
Contract.

      Section 8.02. Indenture Trustee to Act; Appointment of Successor. Upon the
Master Servicer's receipt of notice of termination pursuant to Section 8.01 or
Section 8.06 or resignation pursuant to Section 7.04, the Indenture Trustee, or
in the case of a termination pursuant to Section 8.06, the Backup Servicer,
shall be the successor to the Master Servicer in its capacity as servicer under
this Agreement, and shall be subject to all the responsibilities, duties and
liabilities relating thereto placed on the Master Servicer by the terms and
provisions of this Agreement, except that neither the Indenture Trustee nor the
Backup Servicer shall be obligated to purchase Contracts pursuant to Section
4.07 unless the obligation to repurchase arose after the date of the notice of
termination given to the Master Servicer pursuant to Section 8.01 or Section
8.06, as the case may be, or be subject to any obligation of the Master Servicer
to indemnify or hold harmless any Person as set forth in this Agreement arising
from the acts or omissions of the predecessor Master Servicer. Any successor
Master Servicer, including the Backup Servicer, shall have the rights (including
any right of indemnity) of the Master Servicer. Furthermore, the Backup Servicer
shall have a right of indemnity under Articles Six and Seven


                                       64
<PAGE>

hereof in connection with the performance of its duties prior to becoming the
successor Master Servicer. As compensation therefor, the Indenture Trustee or
the Backup Servicer, as the case may be, shall be entitled to such compensation
(whether payable out of the Collection Account or otherwise) as the Master
Servicer would have been entitled to under this Agreement if no such notice of
termination shall have been given. If, however, a bankruptcy trustee or similar
official has been appointed for the Master Servicer, and no Servicer Default
other than such appointment has occurred, such trustee or official may have the
power to prevent the Indenture Trustee or the Noteholders from effecting a
transfer of servicing. Notwithstanding the above, in the event of a termination
of the Master Servicer pursuant to Section 8.01, the Indenture Trustee may, if
it shall be unwilling to act, or shall, if it shall be legally unable so to act,
appoint, or petition a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint, any
established financial institution, having a net worth of not less than
$50,000,000 and whose regular business shall include the servicing of motor
vehicle retail installment sales contracts, as the successor to the Master
Servicer under this Agreement. Pending appointment of any such successor Master
Servicer, the Indenture Trustee shall act in such capacity as provided above. In
connection with such appointment, the Indenture Trustee may make such
arrangements for the compensation of such successor out of payments on Contracts
it and such successor shall agree. The Indenture Trustee and such successor
shall take such action, consistent with this Agreement, as shall be necessary to
effectuate any such succession.

      Section 8.03. Repayment of Advances. If the identity of the Master
Servicer shall change, the predecessor Master Servicer shall be entitled to
receive reimbursement for outstanding Advances pursuant to Section 5.04 with
respect to all Advances made by the predecessor Master Servicer.

      Section 8.04. Notification to Noteholders and Certificateholders. Upon any
termination of, or appointment of a successor to, the Master Servicer pursuant
to this Article, the Owner Trustee shall give prompt written notice thereof to
Certificateholders at their respective addresses appearing in the Certificate
Register, and the Indenture Trustee shall give prompt written notice thereof to
Noteholders at their respective addresses appearing in the Note Register and to
each Rating Agency.

      Section 8.05. Waiver of Past Defaults. The Holders of Notes evidencing not
less than a majority of the Outstanding Amount of the Notes of the Controlling
Class, or, if all the Notes have been paid in full and the Indenture has been
discharged in accordance with its terms, Certificateholders evidencing not less
than a majority of the aggregate Certificate Percentage Interest (in the case of
any default which does not adversely affect the Indenture Trustee or the
Noteholders) may, on behalf of all Securityholders waive in writing any default
by the Master Servicer in the performance of its obligations hereunder and its
consequences, except a default in making any required deposits to or payments
from any of the Trust Accounts in accordance with this Agreement or in respect
of a covenant or provisions hereof which cannot be modified without the consent
of each Securityholder. Upon any such waiver of a past default, such default
shall cease to exist, and any Servicer Default arising therefrom shall be deemed
to have been remedied for every purpose of this Agreement. No such waiver shall
extend to any subsequent or other default or impair any right consequent
thereto.

      Section 8.06. Backup Servicer. If a Backup Servicer Event has occurred and
continuing, the Holders of Notes evidencing not less than a majority of the
Outstanding Amount of the Notes of the Controlling Class, by notice then given
in writing to the Master Servicer, the Indenture Trustee and the Owner Trustee
may terminate all the rights and obligations of the Master Servicer under this
Agreement. Upon such termination, the Backup Servicer shall become successor
Master Servicer in accordance with Sections 8.01 and 8.02.

as of which the Aggregate Principal Balance is less than or equal to
$135,000,000, the Seller shall have the option to purchase the remaining
Contracts from the Issuer. Notice of the exercise of such option shall be given
by the Seller to the Owner Trustee and the Indenture Trustee not later than the

Indenture Trustee for the benefit of the Securityholders, by deposit in the
Collection Account on the Business Day immediately preceding the related
Distribution Date, the Aggregate Repurchase Amount, and shall succeed to all
interests in and to the Issuer. Such purchase shall be deemed to have occurred
on the last day of such Collection Period. In addition, if the Master Servicer
or the Seller has outstanding senior debt and such debt is not rated "investment
grade" by Moody's at the time of exercising the option pursuant to this Section,
then the Master Servicer or such Seller shall deliver to the Owner Trustee, the
Indenture Trustee and Moody's, an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such
optional purchase is not a fraudulent conveyance.

      (b) Upon any sale of the assets of the Issuer pursuant to Section 5.04 of
the Indenture, the Master Servicer shall instruct the Indenture Trustee to
deposit the proceeds from such sale after all payments and reserves therefrom
have been made (the "Insolvency Proceeds") in the Collection Account. On the
Distribution Date on which the Insolvency Proceeds are deposited in the
Collection Account (or, if such proceeds are not so deposited on a Distribution
Date, on the Distribution Date immediately following such deposit), the Master
Servicer shall instruct the Indenture Trustee to distribute funds on deposit in
the Collection Account (including such Insolvency Proceeds and any funds on
deposit in the Spread Account in accordance with Section 5.06(a) of the
Indenture.

      (c) As described in Article Nine of the Trust Agreement, notice of any
termination of the Issuer shall be given by the Master Servicer to the Owner
Trustee and the Indenture Trustee as soon as practicable after the Master
Servicer has received notice thereof.

      (d) Following the satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture and the
payment in full of the principal of and interest on the Notes, the
Certificateholders will succeed to the rights of the Noteholders hereunder and
the Owner Trustee will succeed to the rights of, and assume the obligations of,
the Indenture Trustee pursuant to this Agreement.

      (e) On a Distribution Date on which an optional purchase pursuant to
Section 9.01(a) of all remaining Contracts in the Issuer occur, the Master
Servicer shall instruct the Indenture Trustee to make the following

Agreement may not be amended to alter the rights or obligations of the Indenture
Trustee without the prior consent of the Indenture Trustee.

The manner of obtaining such consents and of evidencing the authorization by
Noteholders and Certificateholders of the execution thereof shall be subject to
such reasonable requirements as the Owner Trustee or the Indenture Trustee may
prescribe.

      (e) Prior to the execution of any amendment to this Agreement, the Owner
Trustee shall be entitled to receive and rely upon an Opinion of Counsel stating

and the Indenture Trustee at least 60 days' prior written notice of any
