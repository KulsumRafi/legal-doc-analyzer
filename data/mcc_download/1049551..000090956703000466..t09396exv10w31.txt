Agreement.

         SECTION 4. Default and Acceleration. If an Event of Default (as defined

6.1(G) of the Loan Agreement has occurred and is continuing, Lender may at any
time, in addition to any other rights or remedies available to it pursuant to
this Note, the Loan Agreement and the Mortgage Loan Assignment Agreement, or at

advisable to protect and enforce its rights against Borrower and in any of the
Collateral (as defined in the Loan Agreement), including, without limitation, by
notice to Borrower, declare the Debt to be forthwith due and payable, whereupon
such Debt shall become and be forthwith due and payable, without presentment,
demand, protest or further notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly

         SECTION 5. Savings Clause. It is expressly stipulated and agreed to be
the intent of Borrower and Lender that this Note complies with the applicable
usury and other laws relating to this Note now or hereafter in effect. If any
such applicable laws render usurious any amount called for under this Note, or
contracted for, charged or received with respect to this Note, or if the
acceleration of the maturity of this Note or if any prepayment by Borrower
results in Borrower having paid any interest in excess of that permitted by
applicable law, then it is the express intent of the parties that all excess
amounts theretofore collected by Lender be refunded to Borrower, and the
provisions of this Note immediately be deemed reformed and the amounts
thereafter collected under this Note reduced, without the necessity of the

"late charge" in an amount equal to five percent (5%) of the amount so overdue

and is in addition to Lender's right to collect reasonable fees and charges of
any agents or attorneys which Lender may employ in connection with any default.

         (b) If Borrower shall default in any payment of principal or interest,
or any other amount owed by Borrower under this Note, the Loan Agreement or the

principal amount of this Note, payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date
and on demand, at a rate per annum equal at all times to the lesser of (x) the
maximum non-usurious rate permitted by applicable law or (y) three percent (3%)
per annum above the applicable Interest Rate until such defaulted amount has
been paid by Borrower, together with interest thereon at the Default Rate.
Payment or acceptance of the increased rate as provided in this Section is not a
permitted alternative for timely payment and shall not constitute a waiver of a
Default or an Event of Default or an amendment to this Note, the Loan Agreement
or the Mortgage Loan Assignment Agreement and shall not otherwise prejudice or
limit any rights or remedies of Lender.

         SECTION 7. No Oral Change. This Note may not be modified, amended,
waived, extended, changed, discharged or terminated orally or by act or failure
to act on the part of Borrower or Lender, but only by an agreement in writing

waiver, extension, change, discharge or termination is sought.

         SECTION 8. Waivers. Except for any notices expressly provided for in
this Note, the Loan Agreement or the Mortgage Loan Assignment Agreement,
Borrower and all others who may become liable for the payment of all or any part
of the Debt do hereby severally waive presentment and demand for payment, notice
of dishonor, protest and notice of protest and non-payment and all other notices
of any kind. No release of any security for the Debt or extension of time for
payment of this Note or any installment hereof, and no alteration, amendment or
waiver of any provision of this Note, the Loan Agreement or the Mortgage Loan
Assignment Agreement between Lender or any other person or party shall release,
modify, amend, waive, extend, change, discharge, terminate or affect the
liability of Borrower, and any other person or entity who may become liable for
the payment of all or any part of the Debt, under this Note, the Loan Agreement
or the Mortgage Loan Assignment Agreement. No notice to or demand on Borrower
shall be deemed to be a waiver of the obligation of Borrower or of the right of
Lender to take further action without further notice or demand as provided for
in this Note, the Loan Agreement or the Mortgage Loan Assignment Agreement. Any
failure of Lender to insist upon strict performance by Borrower of any of the
provisions of this Note, the Loan Agreement or the Mortgage Loan Assignment
Agreement shall not be deemed a waiver of any of the terms or provisions of this
Note, the Loan Agreement or the Mortgage Loan Assignment Agreement, and Lender
shall have the right thereafter to insist upon strict performance by Borrower of
any and all of them.

         SECTION 9. Non Recourse. Except as otherwise provided herein and the
Loan Agreement and the Mortgage Loan Assignment Agreement, Lender shall not
enforce the liability and obligation of Borrower to perform and observe the
obligations contained in this Note, the Loan Agreement and the Mortgage Loan
Assignment Agreement by any action or proceeding wherein a money judgment shall

the Loan Agreement or the Mortgage Loan Assignment Agreement, or (iii) impair

Agreement.

         SECTION 4. Default and Acceleration. If an Event of Default (as defined

6.1(G) of the Loan Agreement has occurred and is continuing, Lender may at any
time, in addition to any other rights or remedies available to it pursuant to

advisable to protect and enforce its rights against Borrower and in any of the
Collateral (as defined in the Loan Agreement), including, without limitation, by
notice to Borrower, declare the Debt to be forthwith due and payable, whereupon
such Debt shall become and be forthwith due and payable, without presentment,
demand, protest or further notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly

         SECTION 5. Savings Clause. It is expressly stipulated and agreed to be
the intent of Borrower and Lender that this Note complies with the applicable
usury and other laws relating to this Note now or hereafter in effect. If any
such applicable laws render usurious any amount called for under this Note, or
contracted for, charged or received with respect to this Note, or if the
acceleration of the maturity of this Note or if any prepayment by Borrower
results in Borrower having paid any interest in excess of that permitted by
applicable law, then it is the express intent of the parties that all excess
amounts theretofore collected by Lender be refunded to Borrower, and the
provisions of this Note immediately be deemed reformed and the amounts
thereafter collected under this Note reduced, without the necessity of the

         SECTION 6. Late Charges; Mortgage Default Interest Rate.

         (a) Subject to SECTION 5, in the event that any installment of interest
or principal shall become overdue for a period in excess of five (5) days, a
"late charge" in an amount equal to five percent (5%) of the amount so overdue

and is in addition to Lender's right to collect reasonable fees and charges of
any agents or attorneys which Lender may employ in connection with any default.

         (b) If Borrower shall default in any payment of principal or interest,
or any other amount owed by Borrower under this Note, the Loan Agreement or the

maximum non-usurious rate permitted by applicable law or (y) three percent (3%)
per annum above the applicable Interest Rate until such defaulted amount has
been paid by Borrower, together with interest thereon at the Default Rate.
Payment or acceptance of the increased rate as provided in this Section is not a
permitted alternative for timely payment and shall not constitute a waiver of a
Default or an Event of Default or an amendment to this Note, the Loan Agreement
or the Mortgage Loan Assignment Agreement and shall not otherwise prejudice or
limit any rights or remedies of Lender.

         SECTION 7. No Oral Change. This Note may not be modified, amended,
waived, extended, changed, discharged or terminated orally or by act or failure
to act on the part of Borrower or Lender, but only by an agreement in writing

this Note, the Loan Agreement or the Mortgage Loan Assignment Agreement,
Borrower and all others who may become liable for the payment of all or any part
of the Debt do hereby severally waive presentment and demand for payment, notice
of dishonor, protest and notice of protest and non-payment and all other notices

payment of this Note or any installment hereof, and no alteration, amendment or
waiver of any provision of this Note, the Loan Agreement or the Mortgage Loan
Assignment Agreement between Lender or any other person or party shall release,
modify, amend, waive, extend, change, discharge, terminate or affect the
liability of Borrower, and any other person or entity who may become liable for
the payment of all or any part of the Debt, under this Note, the Loan Agreement
or the Mortgage Loan Assignment Agreement. No notice to or demand on Borrower
shall be deemed to be a waiver of the obligation of Borrower or of the right of
Lender to take further action without further notice or demand as provided for
in this Note, the Loan Agreement or the Mortgage Loan Assignment Agreement. Any
failure of Lender to insist upon strict performance by Borrower of any of the
provisions of this Note, the Loan Agreement or the Mortgage Loan Assignment
Agreement shall not be deemed a waiver of any of the terms or provisions of this
Note, the Loan Agreement or the Mortgage Loan Assignment Agreement, and Lender
shall have the right thereafter to insist upon strict performance by Borrower of
any and all of them.

         SECTION 9. Non Recourse. Except as otherwise provided herein and the
Loan Agreement and the Mortgage Loan Assignment Agreement, Lender shall not
enforce the liability and obligation of Borrower to perform and observe the
obligations contained in this Note, the Loan Agreement and the Mortgage Loan
Assignment Agreement by any action or proceeding wherein a money judgment shall

validity or enforceability of any indemnity made in connection with this Note,
the Loan Agreement or the Mortgage Loan Assignment Agreement, or (iii) impair

right to execute and deliver this Note, the Loan Agreement and the Mortgage Loan
Assignment Agreement and that this Note, the Loan Agreement and the Mortgage

6.1(G) of the Loan Agreement has occurred and is continuing, Lender may at any
time, in addition to any other rights or remedies available to it pursuant to

advisable to protect and enforce its rights against Borrower and in any of the

such Debt shall become and be forthwith due and payable, without presentment,
demand, protest or further notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly

such applicable laws render usurious any amount called for under this Note, or
contracted for, charged or received with respect to this Note, or if the
acceleration of the maturity of this Note or if any prepayment by Borrower
results in Borrower having paid any interest in excess of that permitted by
applicable law, then it is the express intent of the parties that all excess
amounts theretofore collected by Lender be refunded to Borrower, and the
provisions of this Note immediately be deemed reformed and the amounts
thereafter collected under this Note reduced, without the necessity of the

maximum non-usurious rate permitted by applicable law or (y) three percent (3%)
per annum above the applicable Interest Rate until such defaulted amount has
been paid by Borrower, together with interest thereon at the Default Rate.
Payment or acceptance of the increased rate as provided in this Section is not a
permitted alternative for timely payment and shall not constitute a waiver of a
Default or an Event of Default or an amendment to this Note, the Loan Agreement
or the Mortgage Loan Assignment Agreement and shall not otherwise prejudice or
limit any rights or remedies of Lender.

         SECTION 7. No Oral Change. This Note may not be modified, amended,
waived, extended, changed, discharged or terminated orally or by act or failure
to act on the part of Borrower or Lender, but only by an agreement in writing

of the Debt do hereby severally waive presentment and demand for payment, notice
of dishonor, protest and notice of protest and non-payment and all other notices

payment of this Note or any installment hereof, and no alteration, amendment or
waiver of any provision of this Note, the Loan Agreement or the Mortgage Loan
Assignment Agreement between Lender or any other person or party shall release,
modify, amend, waive, extend, change, discharge, terminate or affect the
liability of Borrower, and any other person or entity who may become liable for
the payment of all or any part of the Debt, under this Note, the Loan Agreement
or the Mortgage Loan Assignment Agreement. No notice to or demand on Borrower
shall be deemed to be a waiver of the obligation of Borrower or of the right of
Lender to take further action without further notice or demand as provided for
in this Note, the Loan Agreement or the Mortgage Loan Assignment Agreement. Any
failure of Lender to insist upon strict performance by Borrower of any of the
provisions of this Note, the Loan Agreement or the Mortgage Loan Assignment
Agreement shall not be deemed a waiver of any of the terms or provisions of this
Note, the Loan Agreement or the Mortgage Loan Assignment Agreement, and Lender
shall have the right thereafter to insist upon strict performance by Borrower of
any and all of them.

         SECTION 9. Non Recourse. Except as otherwise provided herein and the
Loan Agreement and the Mortgage Loan Assignment Agreement, Lender shall not
enforce the liability and obligation of Borrower to perform and observe the
obligations contained in this Note, the Loan Agreement and the Mortgage Loan
Assignment Agreement by any action or proceeding wherein a money judgment shall

the Loan Agreement or the Mortgage Loan Assignment Agreement, or (iii) impair

right to execute and deliver this Note, the Loan Agreement and the Mortgage Loan

time, in addition to any other rights or remedies available to it pursuant to

such Debt shall become and be forthwith due and payable, without presentment,

         SECTION 5. Savings Clause. It is expressly stipulated and agreed to be

such applicable laws render usurious any amount called for under this Note, or
contracted for, charged or received with respect to this Note, or if the
acceleration of the maturity of this Note or if any prepayment by Borrower
results in Borrower having paid any interest in excess of that permitted by
applicable law, then it is the express intent of the parties that all excess
amounts theretofore collected by Lender be refunded to Borrower, and the
provisions of this Note immediately be deemed reformed and the amounts
thereafter collected under this Note reduced, without the necessity of the

per annum above the applicable Interest Rate until such defaulted amount has
been paid by Borrower, together with interest thereon at the Default Rate.
Payment or acceptance of the increased rate as provided in this Section is not a
permitted alternative for timely payment and shall not constitute a waiver of a
Default or an Event of Default or an amendment to this Note, the Loan Agreement
or the Mortgage Loan Assignment Agreement and shall not otherwise prejudice or
limit any rights or remedies of Lender.

         SECTION 7. No Oral Change. This Note may not be modified, amended,
waived, extended, changed, discharged or terminated orally or by act or failure
to act on the part of Borrower or Lender, but only by an agreement in writing

modify, amend, waive, extend, change, discharge, terminate or affect the
liability of Borrower, and any other person or entity who may become liable for
the payment of all or any part of the Debt, under this Note, the Loan Agreement

shall be deemed to be a waiver of the obligation of Borrower or of the right of
Lender to take further action without further notice or demand as provided for
in this Note, the Loan Agreement or the Mortgage Loan Assignment Agreement. Any
failure of Lender to insist upon strict performance by Borrower of any of the
provisions of this Note, the Loan Agreement or the Mortgage Loan Assignment
Agreement shall not be deemed a waiver of any of the terms or provisions of this
Note, the Loan Agreement or the Mortgage Loan Assignment Agreement, and Lender
shall have the right thereafter to insist upon strict performance by Borrower of
any and all of them.

         SECTION 9. Non Recourse. Except as otherwise provided herein and the
Loan Agreement and the Mortgage Loan Assignment Agreement, Lender shall not
enforce the liability and obligation of Borrower to perform and observe the
obligations contained in this Note, the Loan Agreement and the Mortgage Loan
