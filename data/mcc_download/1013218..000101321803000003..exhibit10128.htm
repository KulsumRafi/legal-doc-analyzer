<P>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Guarantee</U>.  The Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees that the Guaranteed Obligations which are monetary obligations shall be paid in full when due and payable, whether upon demand, at the stated or accelerated maturity thereof pursuant to any Loan Document, or otherwise, and that the Guaranteed Obligations which are performance obligations shall be fully performed at the times and in the manner such performance is required by the Loan Documents.  With respect to the Guaranteed Obligations which are monetary obligations, this guarantee is a guarantee of payment and not of collectibility and is absolute and in no way conditional or contingent.  In case any part of the Guaranteed Obligations shall not have been paid when due and payable or performed at the time performance is required, the Guarantor shall, in the case of monetary obligations, within five (5) days after receipt of notice from the Lender, pay or cause to be paid to the Lender the amount thereof as is then due and payable and unpaid (including interest and other charges, if any, due thereon through the date of payment in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Loan Documents) or, in the case of nonmonetary obligations, perform or cause to be performed such obligations in accordance with the Loan Documents.</P>

<P>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Set-Off</U>.  The Guarantor hereby authorizes the Lender, at any time and without notice to set off the whole or any portion or portions of any or all sums credited by or due from the Lender to it against amounts payable under this Agreement.  The Lender shall promptly notify the Guarantor of any such set-off made by the Lender and the application made by the Lender of the proceeds thereof.</P>

<P>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Unenforceability of Guaranteed Obligations, Etc.</U>  If the Borrower is for any reason under no legal obligation to discharge any of the Guaranteed Obligations (other than because the same have been previously discharged in accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents), or if any other moneys included in the Guaranteed Obligations have become unrecoverable from the Borrower by operation of law or for any other reason, including, without limitation, the invalidity or irregularity in whole or in part of any Guaranteed Obligation or of any Loan Document or any limitation on the liability of the Borrower thereunder not contemplated by the Loan Documents or any limitation on the method or terms of payment thereunder which may now or hereafter be caused or imposed in any manner whatsoever, the guarantees contained in this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect and shall be binding upon the Guarantor to the same extent as if the Guarantor at all times had been the principal debtor on all such Guaranteed Obligations.</P>

<P>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Additional Guarantees</U>.  This Agreement shall be in addition to any other guarantee or other security for the Guaranteed Obligations and it shall not be prejudiced or rendered unenforceable by the invalidity of any such other guarantee or security or by any waiver, amendment, release or modification thereof.</P>

<P>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>No Impairment, Etc.</U>  The obligations, covenants, agreements and duties of the Guarantor under this Agreement shall not be affected or impaired by any assignment or transfer in whole or in part of any of the Guaranteed Obligations without notice to the Guarantor, or any waiver by the Lender or any holder of any of the Guaranteed Obligations or by the holders of all of the Guaranteed Obligations of the performance or observance by the Borrower or any other guarantor of any of the agreements, covenants, terms or conditions contained in the Guaranteed Obligations or the Loan Documents or any indulgence in or the extension of the time for payment by the Borrower or any other guarantor of any amounts payable under or in connection with the Guaranteed Obligations or the Loan Documents or any other instrument or agreement relating to the Guaranteed Obligations or of the time for performance by the Borrower or any other guarantor of any other obligations under or arising out of any of the foregoing or the extension or renewal thereof (except that with respect to any extension of time for payment or performance of any of the Guaranteed Obligations granted by the Lender or any other holder of such Guaranteed Obligations to the Borrower, the Guarantor's obligations to pay or perform such Guaranteed Obligation shall be subject to the same extension of time for performance), or the modification or amendment (whether material or otherwise) of any duty, agreement or obligation of the Borrower or any other guarantor set forth in any of the foregoing, or the voluntary or involuntary sale or other disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the Borrower or any other guarantor or insolvency, bankruptcy, or other similar proceedings affecting the Borrower or any other guarantor or any assets of the Borrower or any such other guarantor, or the release or discharge of the Borrower or any such other guarantor from the performance or observance of any agreement, covenant, term or condition contained in any of the foregoing without the consent of the holders of the Guaranteed Obligations by operation of law, or any other cause, whether similar or dissimilar to the foregoing.</P>

<P>10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Bankruptcy Considerations</U>.<B>  </B>The provisions of this Agreement have been approved by the Bankruptcy Court overseeing the Chapter 11 case of the Guarantor.  The obligations of the Guarantor and the Lender shall not be limited, modified or otherwise relieved by any proceedings or orders entered in the Guarantor's bankruptcy case.  The Lender shall be entitled to take all actions it deems appropriate in order that it may exercise its rights and remedies as provided herein without further relief from the Bankruptcy Court so long as the Lender shall provide the Guarantor with at least five (5) Business Days' written notice of its intention to take any such action, unless the Bankruptcy Court enters an order restricting such action.  Except as limited by the foregoing, the Guarantor and the Lender shall retain their respective rights and remedies as provided in this Agreement.</P>

<P>11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Reimbursement, Subrogation, Etc.</U>  The Guarantor hereby covenants and agrees that it will not enforce or otherwise exercise any rights of reimbursement, subrogation, contribution or other similar rights against the Borrower (or any other person against whom the Lender may proceed) with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations prior to the payment in full of all amounts owing with respect to the Loan Documents, and until all indebtedness of the Borrower to the Lender shall have been paid in full, the Guarantor shall not have any right of subrogation, and the Guarantor waives any defense it may have based upon any election of remedies by the Lender which destroys its subrogation rights or its rights to proceed against the Borrower for reimbursement, including, without limitation, any loss of rights the Guarantor may suffer by reason of any rights, powers or remedies of the Borrower in connection with any anti-deficiency laws or any other laws limiting, qualifying or discharging the indebtedness to the Lender.  Until all obligations of the Borrower pursuant to the Loan Documents shall have been paid and satisfied in full, the Guarantor further waives any right to enforce any remedy which the Lender now has or may in the future have against the Borrower, any other guarantor or any other person and any benefit of, or any right to participate in, any security whatsoever now or in the future held by the Lender.</P>
