<PAGE>
         2.2      Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any advances of the

interest at the Prime Rate until the end of the Interest Period in which such
advances were made, and then such advances shall be added to the outstanding
principal sum bearing interest at the Effective LIBOR Rate for the next Interest

charged hereunder shall adjust to be equal to the Elected LIBOR Rate plus two

1.65, then the Effective LIBOR Rate charged hereunder shall adjust to be equal
to the Elected LIBOR Rate plus one and 95/100 percent (1.95%) per annum.

         2.6      All principal and all accrued and unpaid interest shall be due
and payable in full on the Maturity Date, unless a principal payment is
otherwise required prior to the Maturity Date pursuant to the provisions of
Section 5.4 of the Loan Agreement, in which case such principal payment shall be
accordingly made; provided further, however, that Maker may elect, subject to
Payee's approval which may be withheld in Payee's sole and absolute discretion,
to extend the Maturity Date of this Note to November 1, 2005, by giving Payee
written notice of such request after July 1, 2004, but prior to October 1, 2004,
and by paying to Payee, prior to the then current Maturity Date, a
non-refundable loan extension fee in the amount of one-fourth of one percent
(0.25%) of the then outstanding principal balance of this Note; provided further
that, at the time of such election, there shall not have occurred any uncured
Event of Default, as hereinafter defined, or any event which after notice or the
passage of time, or both, could give rise to an Event of Default, or any
materially adverse change in the financial condition of Maker.

         2.7      Should the Maturity Date be extended pursuant to Section 2.6
of this Note, during the Extension Period, Maker shall make monthly principal
payments to Payee in an amount equal to one-three hundredths (1/300) of the
outstanding principal due under this Note as of, and commencing on, the first
day of the Extension Period, in addition to the interest payments due under
Section 2.1.

         2.8      Unless otherwise agreed to, in writing, or otherwise required
by applicable law, payments will be applied first to accrued, unpaid interest,
then to principal, and any remaining amount to any unpaid collection costs, late

                                       5
<PAGE>
charges and other charges, provided, however, upon an Event of Default, Payee
reserves the right to apply payments among principal, interest, late charges,
collection costs and other charges at its discretion. All prepayments shall be
applied to the indebtedness owing hereunder in such order and manner as Payee
may from time to time determine in its sole discretion.

         2.9      All payments of principal and interest due under this Note
shall be made by Maker without any rights of offset or other reduction of the
amount of such payments.

                                  ARTICLE III

                                  LATE CHARGES

         3.1      If any of said payments of principal or interest or any
combination thereof be not paid in full within ten (10) days after such payment
is due, then in addition to the amount of said payment there shall be due, and
Maker promises to pay, a late charge in respect of each said payment in the
amount of five percent (5.0%) of the regularly scheduled payment or $25.00,
whichever is greater, up to the maximum amount of One Thousand Five Hundred
Dollars ($1,500.00) per late charge, which Maker agrees is a fair and reasonable
charge for costs incurred by Payee in processing such late payment and shall not
be deemed a penalty. The late charge may be assessed without notice, shall be
immediately due and payable and shall be in addition to all other rights and
remedies available to Payee.

                                   ARTICLE IV

                                   PREPAYMENT

         4.1      The privilege is hereby reserved by Maker to prepay, upon five
(5) business days' prior written notice to Payee, the outstanding principal
balance of this Note in whole or in part at any time and from time to time
without premium or penalty, provided that a payment of all accrued and unpaid
interest to the date of such prepayment is included with such prepayment.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Maker makes any such prepayment other than on
the last day of an Interest Period, Maker (a) with such prepayment, shall pay
all accrued and unpaid interest to the date of such prepayment, (b) with such
prepayment, shall pay an administrative fee of $100.00, and (c) on demand, shall
reimburse Payee and hold Payee harmless from all losses and expenses incurred by
Payee as a result of such prepayment, including, without limitation, any losses
and expenses arising from the liquidation or reemployment of deposits acquired
to fund or maintain the principal amount prepaid. Such reimbursement shall be
calculated as though Payee funded the principal amount prepaid through the
purchase of U.S. Dollar deposits in the London, England interbank market having
a maturity corresponding to such Interest Period and bearing an interest rate
equal to the LIBOR Rate for such Interest Period, whether in fact that is the
case or not. Payee's determination of the amount of such reimbursement shall be
conclusive in the absence of manifest error. In the event that the prepayment is
made as a result of Acceleration as defined in Section 5.2 below, then a
prepayment premium shall be payable equal to five percent (5%) of the amount
then due.

         6.1      The failure of Payee to exercise any option herein provided
upon the occurrence of any Event of Default shall not constitute a waiver of the
right to exercise such option in the event of any continuing or subsequent Event
of Default. Maker hereby agrees that the maturity of all or any part of the loan

Payee may, at its option, demand, sue for, collect, or make any compromise or
settlement it deems desirable with reference to property held as security
herefor. Payee shall not be bound to take any steps necessary to preserve any
rights in the property held as security herefor against prior parties, which
Maker hereby assumes to do. Maker expressly authorizes Payee to deal in any
manner with any collateral and the security of every kind and character given to
secure the payment of Maker's obligations under this Note, and without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, Maker expressly authorizes Payee to waive any
rights which Payee may have relative to requiring additional collateral or to
surrendering or to releasing collateral held by Payee, or to substituting any
collateral held by Payee for other collateral of like kind, or of any kind, nor
shall the obligations of Maker under this Note, nor the rights of Payee under
the Loan Documents be diminished or in any manner affected by the failure of
Payee to exercise its rights with reference to such collateral or in any manner
failing to proceed against the collateral or security pledged or conveyed as
security for the obligations of Maker under this Note. The provisions hereof
shall apply and be controlling as to all property which may at any time be
security herefor.

         6.3      Maker hereby authorizes Payee, in its sole discretion, upon
the occurrence of an Event of Default, to apply all or any portion of the
balance of any account maintained by Maker with Payee to the payment or
reduction, in whole or in part, of any and all principal and interest then due,
whether by acceleration or otherwise, to Payee under this Note. Upon the
occurrence

                                       9
<PAGE>
of any Event of Default, Payee shall have the right to setoff against all
obligations of Maker to Payee hereunder, whether matured or unmatured, all
amounts owing to Maker by Payee, whether or not then due and payable, and all
other funds or property of Maker on deposit with or otherwise held in the
custody of Payee or any of its affiliates, all without notice to or demand on
Maker, such notice and demand being hereby waived.

         6.4      Presentment for payment, notice of dishonor, protest, notice
of protest and diligence in bringing suit against any party hereto are hereby
waived by Maker.

         6.5      Maker hereby waives all relief from any and all appraisement
or exemption laws now in force or hereafter enacted.

         6.6      The obligations evidenced or created by this Note, as well as
all waivers of rights by Maker contained herein shall effectively bind and be
the obligations and waivers of any and all others who may at any time become
liable for the payment of all or any part of this Note, including, without
limitation, all indorsers and guarantors.

         6.7      Nothing herein contained, nor in any of the other Loan
Documents or other documents relating hereto, shall be construed or so operate
as to require Maker, or any person liable for the payment of the loan made
pursuant to this Note, to pay interest in an amount or at a rate greater than
the highest rate permissible under applicable law. Should any interest or other
charges paid by Maker, or any parties liable for the payment of the loan made
pursuant to this Note, result in the computation or earning of interest in
excess of the highest rate permissible under applicable law, then any and all
such excess shall be and the same is hereby waived by Payee, and all such excess
shall be automatically credited against and in reduction of the principal
balance, and any portion of said excess which exceeds the principal balance
shall be paid by Payee to Maker and any parties liable for the payment of the
loan made pursuant to this Note, it being the intent of the parties hereto that
under no circumstances shall Maker or any parties liable for the payment of the
loan hereunder, be required to pay interest in excess of the highest rate
permissible under applicable law. All interest paid or agreed to be paid to
Payee shall, to the extent permitted under applicable law, be amortized,
prorated, allocated and spread throughout the full period until payment in full
of this Note, including the period of any renewal or extensions thereof, so that
interest thereon for such full period shall not exceed the maximum amount
permitted by applicable law.

         Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein contained, in the event
that the Effective Rate should ever exceed the highest rate permissible under
applicable law, thereby causing the interest accruing on the indebtedness
evidenced by this Note to be limited to such highest rate permissible under
applicable law, then any subsequent reduction in the Effective Rate shall not
reduce the rate of interest charged hereunder below the highest rate permissible
under applicable law until the total amount of interest accrued on the
indebtedness evidenced by this Note equals the amount of interest which would
have accrued on such indebtedness if the Effective Rate had been in effect at
all times in the period during which the rate charged thereon was limited to the
highest rate permissible under applicable law.

         6.9      If any provision (or any part of any provision) contained in
this Note shall for any reason be held or deemed to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability
shall not affect any other provision (or remaining part of the affected
provision) of this Note, and this Note shall be construed as if such invalid,
illegal or unenforceable provision (or part thereof) had never been contained
herein and the remaining provisions of this Note shall remain in full force and
effect.

shall be due, by filing an original or a photostatic copy of this Note. Maker
waives any right to move any court for an order having any attorney or firm
representing Payee removed or disqualified as counsel for Payee as a result of
such attorney or firm confessing judgment against Maker in accordance with this
Section 6.10. Maker hereby expressly waives any conflicts of interest that may
now or hereafter exist as a result of any attorney representing Payee confessing
judgment against Maker and expressly consents to any attorney representing Payee
or to any other attorney to confess judgment against Maker in accordance with
this Section 6.10. Maker hereby further consents and agrees that Payee may pay
