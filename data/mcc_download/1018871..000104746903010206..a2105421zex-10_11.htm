The Executive's employment under this Agreement shall terminate automatically upon his death. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;Disability.
If, as a result of the Executive's incapacity due to physical or mental illness, the Executive is absent from the performance of his duties under this
Agreement for a period of four (4)&nbsp;months during any twelve-month period, and within 10&nbsp;days after written notice of termination is given, the Executive does not return to the
performance of his duties under this Agreement, the Company may terminate the Executive's employment under this Agreement for "Disability." </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;Cause.
The Company may at any time terminate the Executive's employment under this Agreement for Cause. For purposes of this Agreement, "Cause" means: (i)&nbsp;the
willful and continued failure by the Executive to substantially perform his duties under this Agreement (other than any such failure resulting from the Executive's incapacity due to physical or mental
illness or from the termination of this Agreement by the Executive for Good Reason), after a demand for substantial performance is delivered to the Executive by the Company specifically identifying
the manner in which the Company believes the Executive has not substantially performed his duties, and the Executive shall have failed to resume substantial performance of such duties within thirty
(30)&nbsp;days of receiving such demand, (ii)&nbsp;the willful engaging by the Executive in criminal conduct (including embezzlement and criminal fraud) which is demonstrably and materially
injurious to the Company, monetarily or otherwise, or (iii)&nbsp;the conviction of the Executive of a felony (other than a traffic violation). For purposes of this paragraph, no act, or failure to
act, on the Executive's part shall be considered "willful" unless done, or omitted to be done, by him not in good faith and without reasonable belief that his action or omission was in the best
interest of the Company. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Executive shall not be deemed to have been terminated for Cause unless and until there shall have been delivered to the
Executive a copy of a resolution, duly adopted by the affirmative vote of not less than a majority of the members of the Board then in office (other than the Executive) at a meeting of the Board
called and held for such purpose (after reasonable notice to the Executive and an opportunity for him, together with his counsel, to be heard before the Board), finding that in the good faith opinion
of the Board the Executive was guilty of conduct set forth in clause&nbsp;(i), (ii)&nbsp;or (iii), above, and specifying the particulars thereon in detail. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;Termination
by the Executive. The Executive may terminate his employment under this Agreement (i)&nbsp;for Good Reason, or (ii)&nbsp;if his health should become
impaired to any extent that makes the continued performance of his duties under this Agreement hazardous to his physical or mental health or his life, provided that the Executive shall have furnished
the Company with a written statement from a qualified doctor to such effect and provided, further, that at the Company's request and expense the Executive shall submit to an examination by a doctor
selected by the Company and such doctor shall have concurred in the conclusion of the Executive's doctor. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For
purposes of this Agreement, "Good Reason" means, without the Executive's prior written consent, the occurrence of any one or more of the following: (A)&nbsp;any action by the
Company which results in a material diminution in the nature or status of the Executive's position, authority, duties or responsibilities; (B)&nbsp;a failure by the Company to pay any amounts of
Base Salary, Annual Bonus or other amounts payable hereunder, or to comply with its other obligations and agreements contained herein; (C)&nbsp;a failure of the Company to obtain an agreement from
any successor to the Company to assume and agree to perform this Agreement, as contemplated in </FONT></P>
